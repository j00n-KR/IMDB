0,MartinHafer,"Gee,...I feel like such an unsophisticated boob!",3,8 July 2006,"This is a movie that is often hailed as a masterpiece because of its godlike director, Stanley Kubrick. And I know I'm going to get some serious negative reactions out there, but I really didn't like this movie at all and think it's one of the most overrated films of the 1970s.This is a costume drama that looks very pretty on the surface, but down deep it lacks a soul and any trace of warmth or humanity. Ryan O'Neil is inexplicably chosen to play the title character, though why this American was chosen I have no idea--particularly since, at times, he appeared to be half asleep during the film. This movie is just dreadfully dull and uninteresting.I seriously wonder what would have happened if a lesser-known or obscure director had made this film. I'm sure it wouldn't have received all the kudos and people might have recognized that it was a poor film.After noting all the ""not helpful"" scores given to the other reviewers who panned this movie on IMDb, I guess I'll just sit back and wait for them to start pouring my way!",Barry Lyndon
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of Kubrick's best and most misunderstood,10,13 January 2011,"Not his best(2001), but Barry Lyndon is a beautiful film that is so easily dismissed. I am fond of Stanley Kubrick's movies, and I honestly think Barry Lyndon is one of his best. I am not sure about it being underrated, but it is almost certainly misunderstood. Yes it is long, and yes it is slow. The length didn't bother me, and neither did the pace actually. The slow pacing as others have said is deliberate, it is essential to the rhythm of this film. Even if you can't adjust to the film's pace, so many other things compensate, especially the authentic period look, the ravishingly beautiful photography, Kubrick's superb direction and a hypnotizing music score. The story is well constructed, as is the dialogue, while the acting is fine. Ryan O'Neal and Marissa Berenson have often been criticised, but I think their bloodlessness and vacancy are a strength rather than a weakness. That aside, Leonard Rossiter, Hardy Kruger and especially Leon Vitali give fine supporting performances, while the climatic duel scene is definitive and the narration from Michael Hordern is excellent. So all in all, actually an excellent film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Barry Lyndon
2,bkoganbing,Irish social climber,7,21 December 2013,"Acclaimed by many as Stanley Kubrick's finest, I think Barry Lyndon is a good film that misses being a great one due to some truly bad casting. I can only imagine such folks as Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris, and Albert Finney were off doing other projects that Ryan O'Neal was selected for the title role. Try as he might O'Neal is just way too American to fit the part of an 18th century Irishman who wishes to rise in society and not care how he does it.I have to say that Kubrick's recreation of the 18th century in both its look and mores is nothing short of magnificent. Small wonder that Barry Lyndon won Oscars for Costume Design, Best Music Score, Cinematography and Art&Set Design. The technical aspect he nailed down beautifully.As for O'Neal in 18th century Ireland and assuming he's a Protestant there are still limited means of opportunity. Seduced by Gay Hamilton his first love, she abandons him for marriage to a wealthy British officer. And when O'Neal refuses to leave she and her family play a very interesting trick which I won't reveal to force him to leave.After time in both the British and Prussian armies during the Seven Years War and some lucrative years at the gaming tables, O'Neal has his turn at seduction when he beds Marisa Berenson while she's still married to the titled Frank Middlemass. Then he dies and O'Neal weds her and her money, but earns the undying enmity of her son Leon Vitali. That in fact seals his fate.O'Neal and Berenson do have a child of their own and seeing the scenes between O'Neal and his own son made me think that Thackerey's treatment of the father/son relationship was the model for what Margaret Mitchell did with Rhett Butler and Bonnie Blue Butler in Gone With The Wind.Kubrick opted for a full treatment of Thackerey's novel just as David O. Selznick did with Gone With The Wind. Unfortunately Ryan O'Neal just did not fit the title role as Clark Gable did with Rhett Butler.",Barry Lyndon
3,SnoopyStyle,beautiful and slow,5,24 February 2015,"It's the 18th Century Ireland. Redmond Barry's father is killed in a duel over a horse. Barry (Ryan O'Neal) falls for his cousin Nora Brady but she gets engaged to English Captain John Quin. Barry shoots him in a duel and runs away to join the army. He finds out that the duel was set up by the Brady family and Quin isn't actually dead. Barry fights in the Seven Years' War. He deserts and is later forced to join the Prussian Army. He is rewarded for saving Captain Potzdorf. He is brought in to verify if Irishman gambler Chevalier de Balibari is actually a spy. The two men escape and become gambling associates. He eventually marries the wealthy Lady Lyndon. With her wealth and his new name, he returns to England. His need to gain acceptance in high society is rebuffed by his stepson Charles. His son Bryan with Lady Lyndon dies and he is devastated.Stanley Kubrick is meticulous and masterful. Every scene is perfected to his requirements. It's a beautiful piece of art but not necessarily a compelling movie. The Michael Hordern narration keeps droning on and on. The pace is incredibly slow. Barry Lyndon is not likable or very compelling. Ryan O'Neal is mostly lifeless in this mannered costume drama. That's not to say that there isn't any drama or emotional content. The movie doesn't take full adventure of the story. The lead character just doesn't come to life. The constant dueling is a little bit funny but it doesn't do enough to excite the whole 3 hours. The last duel with Bullingdon is just terrific but it doesn't make the whole movie.",Barry Lyndon
4,Prismark10,A malignant fate,7,7 July 2016,"The narrator Michael Hordern informs us of the rise and fall of the Irish adventurer Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) in eighteenth century Europe. It is adapted from William Thackeray's 1844 novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon.It is not a swashbuckling romance of a heroic soldier. The film is book-ended by two farcical duels, the first of which is a set up.Our anti-hero gets involved in an adolescent love affair with a cousin in Ireland and has to leave suddenly after a duel with a rival who can offer better prospects to her. He gets robbed by an highwayman when fleeing, enlists almost accidentally into the British army, fights in Europe, deserts once, then gets caught and made to fight with the Prussian army where he also later deserts from. Lyndon falls in with unscrupulous companions and gets involved in cheating at card games all over Europe before he marries into wealth. However even that is not enough for him as in his quest to social climb he destroys himself.It is in some ways one of Kubrick's warmest films helped by cinematography all shot by natural light and candlepower that makes it look like a composition from a painting by Constable, Gainsborough or Reynolds. There is sumptuous art direction the only let down is the almost diffident acting from O'Neal, almost placid to each fortune good or bad the befalls him.Ryan O'Neal was a big Hollywood name back in the 1970s but his career soon fizzled out. A competent actor but never really a big enduring star. Just observe him in 'A Bridge too Far' and his scenes with Robert Redford who has a much shorter cameo and you wonder why the roles were not reversed.Maybe Kubrick wanted O'Neal to be aloof and let the supporting characters such as Hardy Kruger, Patrick Magee, Arthur O'Sullivan and Leonard Rossiter to shine. Yet there are elements of comedy in some of the escapades which O'Neal could had taken advantage off and stamped his acting.Despite the beauty of the visuals this film is overlong at 3 hours. It unfolds at a stately pace and Lyndon slowly reveals himself to be venal who only truly cares about his son. He fritters away his wife's fortune in his quest for acceptance by society until his grown up stepson wreaks revenge and for a moment he shows some humanity in the final duel but it is too late for him.Kubrick took a little known Victorian novel and made it exquisite in its sharpness and less of a chocolate box costume drama. Acidic but still heartfelt.",Barry Lyndon
5,claudio_carvalho,A Piece of Art,9,11 August 2007,"In the Eighteenth Century, in a small village in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a young farm boy in love of his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). When Nora engages to the British Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges him for a duel of pistols. He wins and escapes to Dublin, but is robbed on the road. Without any other alternative, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian Army, saving the life of his captain and becoming his protégé and spy of the Irish gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He helps Chevalier and becomes his associate until he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They move to England and Barry, in his obsession of nobility, dilapidates her fortune and makes a dangerous and revengeful enemy.Stanley Kubrick is certainly among the ten best directors of the cinema history and it is not necessary to make any comment about his awesome work. ""Barry Lyndon"" is a piece of art, and watching this film, the viewer has the sensation that is seeing pictures at an exhibition. Further, if he or she randomly pauses the DVD on any scene, will have a magnificent painting on the screen of the TV. Therefore, the landscapes, set decoration, art direction, costume design and cinematography are simply spectacular. The music score is one of the most beautiful of the cinema history, with classy and top-notch selection of wonderful classical music. Ryan O'Neal gives his best acting in the best role of his career, an the whole cast is amazing in their intense performances. The long story is engaging, with the narrative in off, in a shameful period of Europe history, telling the raise and fall of an ambitious man initially driven by a lost love. This movie is highly recommended for viewers that appreciate arts. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Barry Lyndon""",Barry Lyndon
6,classicsoncall,"""I never saw a lad more game in me life.""",7,1 December 2017,"Lavish period detail, gorgeous costuming and inspiring cinematography could do nothing for me when it actually came down to the story being told. Except that everything in the picture looked great, this is one of the most boring pictures I ever managed to sit through. One has to wonder whether Ryan O'Neal was miscast, simply bad in the role of Barry Lyndon, or directed to appear virtually clueless in most of his significant scenes. It's understood by this viewer that he was supposed to be a lout, but one didn't need three hours to figure it out. I'm trying hard to come up with something positive, realizing that I stand diametrically opposed to many critics and fans of Kubrick who have marvelous things to say about the film. So I'll just state it once again - it's got lavish period detail, gorgeous costuming and inspiring cinematography. For that, you could watch it with the sound turned off.",Barry Lyndon
7,gavin6942,"Not Kubrick's Best, Though A Great Film Just the Same",7,2 May 2010,"""Barry Lyndon"" is the tale of a young man who comes into power by a stroke of fate. Ryan O'Neal does a fine job in this role, which is bittersweet, knowing that he has such potential but will forever be overshadowed by his girlfriend, Farrah Fawcett.I have nothing really of consequence to say here. I can marvel at the technical skill it took to film by candlelight and whatnot, but others have spent plenty of time on this. In short, the film is a masterpiece, as all of Kubrick's films are. I don't think it's his best work, and it's certainly not my favorite, but as I said, even his least is better than many other directors' best. So, regardless of where you rank this in his career, it's a winner.",Barry Lyndon
8,lee_eisenberg,Kubrick's mild letdown sandwiched in between two greats,7,22 November 2005,"Following a troika of masterpieces (""Dr. Stranglove"", ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange""), Stanley Kubrick decided to make a period piece. In ""Barry Lyndon"", the title character (Ryan O'Neal) abandons all morals with the goal of becoming rich and titled in 18th century England. Of course, he's only doing himself in.It's debatable whether or not Kubrick was the ideal person for a costume drama, although he did a pretty good job here. Unfortunately, Ryan O'Neal isn't quite right to play Lyndon. Still, one can look for similarities to Kubrick's other movies. For example, the first Mr. Lyndon is in a wheelchair (just like Dr. Strangelove and the one character in ""A Clockwork Orange""). There's a bathroom scene, like in ""The Shining"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". Throughout most of the movie, Barry and Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) are wearing red, but not at their wedding (that's a filmic element meaning that they aren't marrying for love). But overall, this isn't the Kubrick movie that I would recommend above all others.",Barry Lyndon
9,jboothmillard,Barry Lyndon,8,17 August 2011,"From BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket), I had heard and seen a few things about this obviously big scale film, and I was definitely going to watch because it featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. Basically in the 18th Century, in a small Irish village, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is the young farm boy who lost his father who was killed in a duel concerning a horse sale, and he is in love with his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). He gets into a duel himself against Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) who wants to marry her, and of course Barry refuses to back off, but he apparently kills his opponent, forcing him to flee to Dublin. On the way he is robbed by famous highwayman Captain Feeny (Ryan's Daughter's Arthur O'Sullivan), and with no money he joins the British army, there he finds out from friend Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley) that Quin is alive, and the whole thing was staged to get rid of him and marry Nora and restore her family's fortune. Barry is sent to fight in the Seven Years' War, where Grogan dies from a wound against the French, so he steals a higher rank's uniform and passes through Holland, encountering Prussian Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Krüger) who knows he is in disguise, and threatens to kill him unless he joins the Prussian army. The war ends and he next joins the Prussian Police and a servant for professional gambler Chevalier De Balibari (Patrick Magee), and after discovering he is not a spy and Irish they become professional cheaters of cards until being expelled. Barry next seduces the beautiful and wealthy Lady Honoria, Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) and after the death of her elderly husband Sir Charles Lyndon (Frank Middlemass) he is able to marry her, and changing his name to Barry Lyndon. Ten year old Bullingdon (Dominic Savage), son of Sir Charles, hates Barry for marrying his mother, and their marriage is unhappy, but they do have a son together, Bryan Patrick (David Morley), and Barry enjoys spending all the money, and being unfaithful, which he apologises for. Years later Barry's Mother (Marie Kean) comes to live with them, and she warns him that if the Countess was to die the fortune would pass onto now young man Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). To help stop this happening he gets himself a better title with the help of Lord Gustavus Adolphus Wendover (André Morell), spending money getting himself to the top, but his efforts are wasted, and Lord Bullington announces his hatred for his stepfather at Lady Lyndon's birthday party. Barry's public cruelty loses him some reputation and powerful friends, he is somewhat shunned from society, but he makes up for it being a good father to Bryan who he cannot refuse any gift, he even buys him a new horse for his ninth birthday. Bryan ignores the wish to not take the horse out and is thrown off and dies a few days later, and filled with grief Barry becomes an alcoholic, while his wife turns to religion, with the assistance of family tutor Reverend Samuel Runt (Murray Melvin). After Lady Lyndon is heard to have attempted suicide due to continuing grief, Lord Bullington returns from places unknown and wants revenge in a duel against his stepfather, and after starting slow he does manage to shoot Barry in his leg, meaning his leg below the knee is amputated. Bullington takes over while his stepfather recovers, and he sends accountant Graham (Philip Stone) to make him an offer and force him out of England forever and end the marriage to his mother, or he will never again get any of the family money and go to jail. With no choice and exhausted Barry agrees, sees his mother, tries to gamble for more money without success, and Barry given the cheque from Lady Lyndon who he never sees again and Bullington looking on as he leaves for good. Narrated by Michael Hordern, also starring Steven Berkoff as Lord Ludd, Diana Körner as Lischen, Billy Boyle as Seamus Feeny and Worzel Gummidge's Anthony Sharp as Lord Hallam. As the title character O'Neal gives a marvellous performance as the man passing through the years in the British aristocracy and faced with many different confrontations and situations, and many other cast members give great performances as well, director Kubrick of course creates perfect pacing, a very intriguing story with many elements and memorable moments, and you can forgive it for being nearly three hours, a most watchable period drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Music for Leonard Rosenman, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material for Kubrick, it won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",Barry Lyndon
10,ccthemovieman-1,Great Paintings Come To Life,10,20 April 2009,"Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings. This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago. It's just beautiful.For that, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too. In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It's no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring. Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you'll really enjoy the soundtrack, too, under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.Not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story. I say ""underrated"" because this film, from what I've read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop. That's too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, ""Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,"" played beautifully by Ryan O'Neal. (For most of the movie, he's called ""Redmond Barry,"" so I will refer to him as that.) Overall, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a ""scoundrel"" back in late 18th century Englishman. ""Mr. Barry"" is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times. While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he's not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itself in small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don't always know how he's going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.We witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his ""sins begin to find him out,"" as the Bible would describe. It's quite a roller coaster ride.This is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears. It's quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick. I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day. Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.",Barry Lyndon
11,moonspinner55,"Opulent and engrossing...however, a deep-thinking sensibility muffles its overall impact",7,4 October 2015,"Stanley Kubrick received Oscar nominations as director, producer, and adaptation-screenwriter of this well-costumed 18th century drama based upon William Makepeace Thackeray's ""Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq."" (originally titled ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"" and published under the pseudonym George Savage FitzBoodle). Yet, where Thackeray's story of an Irish upstart who deserts the British army and is eventually caught and recruited into taking up arms for the Prussians was--by all accounts--a rascally adventure, Kubrick approaches the material somberly. The too-careful filmmaker is enormously fond of pastoral landscapes and action seen from a great distance. Kubrick nearly distances himself from viewers as well, though the characters do finally emerge, and the film builds in quiet emotional power. The themes in Act I are much the livelier; encompassing much of the second act, Barry Lyndon's ill-fated marriage to a wealthy, widowed Countess slows things down. Still, the human faults of the protagonist (adequately played by Ryan O'Neal) come to the fore by the film's third hour, and Barry's showdown with his embittered, sniveling stepson is the stuff of high drama. The pacing, overall, is too funereal, and a child's death is endlessly protracted for little purpose, but the fights and brawls and duels are wonderfully staged. ""Barry Lyndon"" runs 183 minutes, however Kubrick is observant and canny enough to keep things simmering, and only occasionally does interest wane. Fine performances help, including Leonard Rossiter as the showboating Captain Quin (who is sadly revealed to have no spine), Patrick Magee as the wily Chevalier de Balibari, and Dominic Savage and Leon Vitali as the child and adult versions of Lord Bullingdon. The film won Oscars for John Alcott's exquisite cinematography and Leonard Rosenman's (somewhat monotonous) music score, as well as for Costume Design and Art Direction. *** from ****",Barry Lyndon
12,Quinoa1984,"an excellent, rewarding on multiple viewings kind of masterwork",10,13 February 2000,"Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon was a film that upon first experience was a little sluggish, and compared to the bizarre nature of many of his other masterpieces (Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, the Shining) is lacking. But this was years ago, when I perhaps didn't quite have the patience and attention to underlying emotions the film asks. Upon a few more viewings up until now, I find that this really is a remarkable, deliberately paced film about a man trying to find the cues and the ways into this upper class world. This man, played convincingly by Ryan O'Neil, is like the total con-man in the guise of the perfect gentleman (in a sense, of course less violently and less ambitious, the character has a little in common with Alex from Clockwork Orange). Aside from the characterizations, which do become richer in multiple viewings, the compositions are truly unique, and ask of a viewer more than most can handle. Barry Lyndon is the kind of film that, if nothing else, shows that Kubrick wasn't only this madman director of these satires and totally visual experiences (which he was terrific at), but also could do a tender, expressive, and period-perfect film about a world that most of us know from looking at paintings in museums, which is precisely what Kubrick was going for. Deservedly winning of four academy awards (unfortunately not for Kubrick), it also boasts a fine soundtrack of classic works of music.",Barry Lyndon
13,wes-connors,Watch the Paint Dry,5,5 July 2016,"Out of shiny fresh apples, esteemed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick takes a metaphorical lemon and paints it red. He uses only the finest and most exquisite paints available and calls his lemon ""Barry Lyndon"". As you would expect, Mr. Kubrick makes the Lyndon lemon look extraordinarily beautiful. Still, when you look at it for over three hours, you realize it's only an ordinary lemon. Cutting through the outer beauty, you find the lemon sour, overripe and choked with unyielding seeds. A few seeds are well-cast, though. Leon Vitali (as Lord Bullingdon) is one. You will have to wait, but Mr. Vitali does appear before Godot. There are scenes that reach perfection, like those with Lyndon's mother Marie Kean and the Reverend Murray Melvin.

14,sunwarrior13,Kubrick's Greatest Film,10,24 October 2012,"With ornate imagery reminiscent of paintings from the story's 18th century period, Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's novel depicts the rise and fall of a sensitive rogue in the British aristocracy. Barry Lyndon is a period film starring Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee and Hardy Krüger. It was written, produced, and directed by Kubrick. It is based on the novel The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray which recounts the exploits of a fictional 18th century Irish adventurer.Young Irishman Redmond Barry leaves home to seek his fortune after apparently killing an English officer in a duel. Through a series of mishaps and accidents, Barry winds up fighting with the Prussian army in the Seven Years' War under the command of Capt. Potzdorf; at war's end, Potzdorf enlists Barry to spy on a shady Chevalier. Instead, Barry joins up with the Irish Chevalier to flee Prussia and live as gamblers among Europe's elite. Wishing to climb even higher, Barry soon meets the beautiful Lady Lyndon, marrying her for her fortune after her older titled husband dies. Her son Lord Bullingdon, however, despises the upstart Barry, and, regardless of how his mother may feel, sees to it that the re-named Barry Lyndon will never be able to stake his claim to the entrenched aristocracy.In 1975 the world was at Stanley Kubrick's feet. His films Dr. Strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and A Clockwork Orange, released in the previous dozen years, had provoked rapture and consternation--not merely in the film community, but in the culture at large. On the basis of that smashing hat trick, Kubrick was almost certainly the most famous film director of his generation, and absolutely the one most likely to rewire the collective mind of the movie audience. And what did this radical, at-least-20-years-ahead-of-his-time filmmaker give the world in 1975? A stately, three-hour costume drama that now stands as one of his greatest and most savagely ironic films, not to mention one of the few period pieces on celluloid so transporting that it seems to predate the invention of cameras.In addition to that,Ryan O'Neal's excellent performance captures the shallow opportunism endemic to the title character who is brought down as much by his own flaws as by the mores of the ordered social structure of 18th-century England.All of Kubrick's features look better now than when they were first released, but Barry Lyndon, which fared poorly at the box office in 1975, remains his most underrated. It may also be his greatest.",Barry Lyndon

16,hitchcockthelegend,"A lady who sets her heart upon a lad in uniform must prepare to change lovers pretty quickly, or her life will be but a sad one.",8,4 March 2008,"First thing that is patently obvious is that as a visual piece of work the film has few peers, from stunning shots of rolling hills to the lavish period detail, it quite literally is breath taking. The attention to detail by director Stanley Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott is admirable, whilst the costumes are of the highest order. I have never read the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray so have no frame of reference as regards the portrayals we witness unfolding. I have read that many find the film lacking in the humorous wit that is rife in Thackeray's page turner, yet Kubrick's take is full of satire surrounding the social standing that is the core beat of the story - well it certainly had me smiling anyways.The film is pretty downbeat, thus, for a three hour movie it can bog down many a viewers patience. Which puts this into the movie for mood scenario bracket - because I personally wouldn't want to watch it if I was having a particularly blue day, so that is something newcomers to the film might want to bear in mind. There seems to be much division as regards Ryan O'Neal's performance in the film, and again having not read the novel I couldn't tell you if he nailed it. What I do know is that he seems perfect for the tone of the movie, and that really shouldn't be seen as a negative in my opinion. My only gripe really with it is that as a story it really doesn't engage me, I really didn't care about what happened to our title character or the assorted people close in his rapidly annoying world. Is that Kubrick's fault? Well he did his job with much style, the story just doesn't warrant a three hour epic, even when it's dressed up as splendidly as this most assuredly is. 8/10",Barry Lyndon

He's a poor man who marries a rich widow (Marisa Benenson) and tries to assume her husband's place. However it all ends tragically.Many people hate this film. They think it's too long (3 hours+) and boring (when saw it at a revival house years ago most of the audience left during the intermission!). However I think this is director Stanley Kubrick's best film. I was never bored once. The scenery is just gorgeous, the story engrossing and (surprisingly) O'Neal gives an excellent performance. The story does move at a deliberate (meaning slow) pace but that's needed to understand the characters and situations. If you're looking for a quick loud movie with lots of action this isn't for you. However if you're looking for a beautifully made and intricate film about a man's rise and downfall this is for you. I especially love that this doesn't assume that the audience is a bunch of idiots--the narration explains the events calmly and clearly without talking down to you. Easily Kubrick's best film ever.

There is Very Little Substantial Dialog in this Picturesque Picture. it is Composed with Little Camera Movement and even Less Editing. it is the Images that Resonate, on Display in Long Shots and Long Takes.If it was Possible to Zip Back, or more Appropriately Slowly Retreat to the Period on Display here and be a Bird on a Perch, this is what it would Look Like. Things wouldn't Appear as they do in Most Films in Short Quick Cuts with the Eye Darting About Like some kind of Shaky Camera.

With beautiful I mean that the movie is superbly looking with flawless costumes and sets and impressive landscapes and camera-work. And please lets also not forget the beautiful and perfect use of classical music that was all rearranged by composer Leonard Rosenman, for which he also received an Oscar. Same goes for the flawless art-direction, cinematography and costume design. Truly all the Oscars that it at least deserved to get. ""Barry Lyndon"" is a long movie, like Kubrick movies often are. A lot is happening in the story but it never gets to much because the story is told in a slow way. Almost the entire life of the character Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon is told in the movie. As a sort of Irish 18th century Forrest Gump he travels and sees Europe through the eyes of many different sides. It gives a great view and feel of the 18th century Europe and the British 'gentleman' culture in particular.There is some absolutely stunning dialog in the movie. It's this typical old fashioned English polite way of talking that is used in this movie. It was a real joy to listen to and it provided some highly entertaining and memorable moments at times. The lines are all perfectly delivered by the fine actors. It was also great to see Pat Roach in this movie. Pat Roach is known for playing almost every of the big thugs in all the Indiana Jones movies. It's funny, I didn't recognized him by his face or voice but I did by his style of fighting. He fought in the same manner as he later did in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" during the airplane fight.The story is told slowly and beautifully and is all beautiful narrated by Michael Hordern. You'll never be bored while watching this movie, I can guarantee that. There is simply too much happening in this movie to allow that.An absolutely beautiful movie that also is an absolute must see.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Barry Lyndon
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A tale of love, war and power",10,18 December 2004,"While this is, in my opinion, not the best of Kubrick's films, it is in no way a bad film of his... some have claimed it is overlong and dull, but I don't think so. From what I've heard, it does the novel justice, and I believe that is what Kubrick went after, more than anything else. That is admirable, for a man who throughout his career was known for making unfaithful film adaptations of famous and popular novels, much to the dismay of the authors. The film perfectly presents everything from the time period in which it takes place... something that few, if any, other films have accomplished. It deals with the life of Redmond Barry, his ups and downs. The first half has us feeling sympathy with him, and shows his rise to a high position and gain the name Barry Lyndon, and everything that entitles. The second seems to turn us a little more against him, as he goes through the expected downfall that must always follow an unexpected rise to high life. Through the film he gets desensitized and careless. We follow him through most of his life, and an uneventful one it is not. As all other Kubrick films, the visual side is probably the most prominent one of the film, as he grants us several long looks at the beautiful sets and locales, and there are more than a few of his trademark shots slowly zooming out from the focus point to display the surroundings. The plot is great, and almost constantly developing. It is narrated with a good sense of irony and clever social satire on the time period. There's plenty of humor in the film to make the three hour run-time seem less long. The pacing is good and thorough without the film being slow(though I do admit that it isn't a film for those who are not used to long, visual films). The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is excellent all the way. Not even the child-actors seemed less than perfectly convincing. The costumes and sets are great. From what I understand, there is no detail in the film that is even slightly historically inaccurate. That is quite impressive for a film that takes place about a century and a half before it was made. I have heard of great deals of work done to keep many films accurate, but I don't believe one exists that manages to do so with such perfection as this. Even the very language that they speak is accurate. The special effects in the film also deserve mention here... for a film that is almost thirty years old, it's impeccable how believable and convincing the effects are... I couldn't tell how most of them were done. Kubrick was indeed one of the most brilliant directors ever... he was not only a master at his craft, he was also one of the most innovative and inspiring film-makers to have ever lived. I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who has an interest in the time period the film is set and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. Don't miss this one. Not his greatest, but a truly great one nonetheless. 10/10",Barry Lyndon
23,evanston_dad,Like Stepping Into a Classical Painting,9,8 August 2007,"I'm reading Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair"" even as I write this comment, and what strikes me about ""Barry Lyndon"" now that I've read something by the author who wrote it is how much the film recreates the experience of reading Thackeray. ""Vanity Fair"" is nearly 700 pages of nothing much happening, yet it's all fascinating. That's ""Barry Lyndon."" Ryan O'Neal plays the eponymous protagonist, and Marisa Berenson his beleaguered wife in this costume drama that follows the exploits of our dear rogue Lyndon from young manhood to weary middle age. And that's really it for lead characters. Neither O'Neal nor Berenson registers much, but no matter. The true stars here are the film's magnificent and jaw-dropping production design, followed closely by its score, which, like in other Kubrick films, incorporates previously existing classical compositions that are perfectly matched with the material. Every shot in this film looks like a painting, which was Kubrick's intention and why he used such a square aspect ratio. The meticulous details of 18th Century court life make this movie endlessly fascinating, even if many viewers have complained that it's emotionally distant (a criticism that could apply to more than one Kubrick film).I loved ""Barry Lyndon"" the first time I watched it, thought it was hollow and lacking the second time I watched it, and then went back to thinking it a masterpiece the third time I watched it. Let's see how I feel after a fourth viewing. As for now, it's my third impression that sticks.Grade: A",Barry Lyndon
24,JamesHitchcock,Among the best costume dramas ever made,8,17 January 2008,"Stanley Kubrick's movies can be divided into two categories. On the one hand there are his ""originals"", films totally unlike anything else, films like ""Dr Strangelove"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"". I would also include among these ""2001""; although it can nominally be categorised as science-fiction, it is like no other sci-fi movie I have ever seen.On the other hand there are Kubrick's genre pieces, such as ""Full Metal Jacket"" (war) or ""The Shining"" (horror), in which he works within the confines of an established genre. In my view the greatest example (although he himself did not care for it much)is ""Spartacus"", made at a time when Classical epics were highly popular, and perhaps the greatest example of that particular genre ever made. ""Barry Lyndon"" is another genre piece. Although Kubrick was an American by birth, he spent much of his life in Britain, and the film falls within that typically British genre, the historical costume drama. Like many such films, it is based upon a classic novel, in this case by Thackeray. A number of Kubrick's films fall naturally into two halves. In ""Full Metal Jacket"", for example, the first part deals with the experiences of the recruits in training and the second with their experiences on the battlefield. In ""Lolita"" the two acts of the film, before and after the heroine has been seduced by Humbert, correspond to the two parts of Nabokov's novel. ""Barry Lyndon"" follows a similar structure, with Part I narrating the events prior to the hero's marriage and Part II those following it. The tone of Part I is fairly light-hearted, in the tradition of the picaresque novel. The hero (or anti-hero), at this stage known as Redmond Barry, is the poor relation of an impoverished family of eighteenth-century Irish gentry. He has pretensions to being a gentleman, but lacks the financial means to support those pretensions. He is forced to go on the run after he believes he has killed a man in a duel (although, unknown to him, his victim has survived). He joins the British army, deserts while fighting in the Seven Years War and is conscripted into the Prussian army where he saves his commanding officer's life. After the war he becomes first a spy for the Prussian police and then a professional gambler. Eventually he meets a wealthy titled lady, the Countess of Lyndon, and marries her after the death of her first husband. The tone of Part II is more serious. The change in the hero's status is marked by a change in his name; he takes his wife's surname and uses ""Barry"" as his Christian name, seemingly dropping ""Redmond"" altogether. There is also a change in his character; in Part I he comes across as a likable rogue, but in Part II we see a darker side to his character. Although Barry has now achieved the wealth he once dreamt of, he is unable to manage the Countess's estates and is soon in financial difficulties. He quarrels with Lord Bullingdon, the Countess's son from her first marriage, who resents his mother's remarriage to a man he sees as an unscrupulous adventurer. Bullingdon is basically a cowardly young man, but eventually his loathing of his stepfather becomes stronger than his cowardice and he challenges Barry to a duel. This duel comes as the climax to the film and can be interpreted in two ways. Barry refuses to fire at his stepson and fires his pistol into the ground, but his motive for so doing is unclear. It could be that he is motivated by pity for the young man, in which case this can be seen as his redemption scene, in which he redeems himself by a noble, selfless act. On the other hand, it could be that he remains as calculating as ever and, knowing that if he kills, or even injures, Bullingdon, this will lead to a rupture with his wife, makes his gesture in the expectation that his opponent will reciprocate. Ryan O'Neal, who never brings to the part quite the necessary swagger or roguishness, was perhaps not the ideal choice for the hero, although Kubrick seems to have been handicapped by his financial backers who insisted on a big-name American star. I am not, however, sure that his first choice Robert Redford, who turned the role down, would have been ideal either. As he was to prove a few years later in ""Out of Africa"", foreign accents are not Redford's forte; at least O'Neal makes a game attempt at an Irish accent. There are, however, some good performances in supporting roles. One criticism sometimes made of the ""costume drama"" genre is that it is too static, that it involves too many polite conversations in elegant drawing-rooms and not enough physical action. This is not a criticism which could be made of ""Barry Lyndon"", which not only incorporates three duels but also battle scenes and the tragic death of Barry's young son Brian in a riding accident. It runs for over three hours, but it is so well-paced that one does not notice its length. Like many films in this particular genre its reconstruction of period detail means that it is beautiful to look at, perhaps the most visually sumptuous of all Kubrick's films. Effective use is also made of music, especially that Schubert piano trio which was also to feature in Tony Scott's ""The Hunger"". Its use in ""Barry Lyndon"" is, of course, anachronistic as it was composed several decades after the events portrayed, but it nevertheless complements the mood of the film. This is not, perhaps, the director's greatest film, but to say that is no criticism, as he was responsible for a number of masterpieces. It is certainly a very good one, and I would rank it in the top few costume dramas ever made. 8/10",Barry Lyndon
25,lasttimeisaw,"Kubrick's indomitable piece of cinematic wonder,",8,12 August 2015,"Kubrick's 3-hours epic about ups-and-downs of an Irish young man Redmond Barry (O'Neal) in the eighteenth century, narrated through an even-tempered and quite pleasing voice-over (Hordern), Barry is a farm boy raised by his mother (Kean) after lost his father in a duel, his puppy love with cousin Nora Brady (Hamilton) is curbed when Nora decides to marry Captain John Quin (Rossiter), who is able to pay for family debuts; an ensuing duel with John forces him to run away, but soon he is mugged penniless and joins the British Army and fights in the Seven Year's War (1756-1763), shell-shocked in the savagery of war, he takes French leave and takes on a a new identity, after a lovey-dovey time with a German wife Lischen (Körner), his disguised is exposed by Captain Potzdorf (Krüger), and is forced to join the Prussian Army. Then, things seem to be rosy after Barry shows his bravery and gains the trust of Potzdorf. After the war, he is sent to spy on a gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Magee) who also shares the Irish lineage, for whom he double-crosses Potzdorf and becomes his collaborator in the gamble games, eventually Chevalier brings him back to Britain where he woos the affluent Lady Lyndon (Berenson), and divided by an intermission, now starts the second half of his story - where many tragedies is awaiting for him. A thematic through-line is Barry's single-minded pursuit to be a nobleman, in the first half, his chivalry wins him admiration in the fist combat among soldiers, but in the real war there is no place for nobility, the gallant facade of infantry being used as canon fodder is ludicrous to comprehend, and a tease to the royal formality. So, as an upstart who marries a rich woman whom he barely loves, Barry is not that clever, since he is never cognizant of the simple fact that the snobbish upper class doesn't welcome parvenus, a significant ally should be his wife, if he cares to manifest his devotion and affections. But now his name is Mr. Barry Lyndon, all he needs is a title to secure the wealth for him and their young son Bryan (Morley), yet his philandering predisposition drives Lady Lyndon away and a critical chasm under the roof is between him and Lord Bullingdon (played by Savage and Vitali in different ages), Lady Lyndon's son from a previous marriage, who will bring about his undoing in the future where Barry becomes a miserable failure who eventually falls from the rank of a gentleman.One of the highly acclaimed aspects of this film is the lavish set production and inspiringly beguiling cinematography, the candle-lit scenes in the second half in particular, various tableaux vivants in stunning period costumes, imbues a transcendent beauty which intoxicates Barry and viewers alike, although underneath the finery, lies the stone-hearted defence system of a dying species. Duel is a key element in the film, from the opening one which dispatches Barry's father, to the one with John which kickstarts Barry's wandering adventures until the final one between him and Lord Bullingdon, which engagingly foregrounds Barry's flawed benevolence in sharp contrast with Bullingdon's craven and vengeful nature of an aristocrat. Also, a kind warning to those well-heeded families, don't ever let your young kids ride a horse, this and GONE WITH THE WIND (1939) are two brutal examples.BARRY LYNDON might fall short as a perfect epic because of it casts O'Neal as the lead, at the age of 33, he is mortifying in the opening when he supposes to be no more than a teenager, but thankfully, it transforms smoothly when Barry ages through the journey, but rarely his performance can galvanise the screen in the protracted duration, wanting of charisma debars audience from projecting a certain amount of sympathy to him, which is a dangerous defect for its epic scale. Even more befuddling is Berenson's Lady Lyndon, who only have a few lines altogether and is one-sidedly portrayed as a mistress who has no talent in governing her man, her children and her wealth, suffice to be Kubrick's last nail in the coffin for the doomed royalty. Numerous supporting characters come and go, barely have their scene-stealing moments, bar Leon Vitali's adult Lord Bullingdon, who is brilliant in the duelling part, Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, whose malicious appearance is the barometer of haughtiness and Marie Kean as Barry's mother, unwittingly eggs him on to his ruin. Another chief accolade should be given to Leonard Rosenman, the music adaptor who won an Oscar for wondrously concatenating Kubrick's favourites classical pieces into the epic length, embellishes the narrative seamlessly and becomes the ballast for a great viewing experience. Winning four Oscars, BARRY LYNDON is notably being the most acknowledged features of Kubrick, but ironically, Kubrick lost all three nominations under his name (BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY). Probably not his best work, but unmistakably, it is an indomitable piece of cinematic wonder, not just for its exquisite etiquette, also an influential fable about breaking the royal orders.",Barry Lyndon

27,dromasca,almost a masterpiece,9,22 March 2008,"I saw this film for the first time, part of the Kubrick retrospective on the ARTE TV channel, and I was fascinated. This classical 18th century story written by a 19th century English writer is being brought to screen by Kubrick with an imagery and a style hard to equal. The story may be a moralistic one - a young Irish makes his way through cheats and lies to the higher positions in the British society, but is unable to live the live of his rank and survive at the pick, falling back mainly due to his own flaws of character. Kubrick films the story in a completely unemotional manner, no social or moral judgment is made, we are just brought a full world, or better say we enter a full world and we have to judge by ourselves.The quality of the visuals is one of the best in any movie I have ever seen. Kubrick seems to have spent a long time watching the paintings of the masters of the epoch, and his exterior landscapes as well as the interior scenes and the sitting and attitudes of his characters seem to be driven from some of these paintings, or even better said, create new ones. I also loved the way the music drives and paces the rhythm of the story, Kubrick used the same technique in 'Eyes Wide Shut' where music, image and actors seem to be part of a broader, more complex orchestration.The almost single weaker part of the story is Ryan O'Neal's acting, this immensely popular actor in the 70s is not up to this film, he seems too young all along, and almost nothing he does throws any light on the motivations of his character. Yet, these may have been Kubrick's directing indications, and he does not spoil the film either, it would have been hard to do it.",Barry Lyndon
28,gbill-74877,They are all equal now,8,5 April 2021,"Kubrick truly transports the viewer to the 18th century with this impeccably shot, very thoughtful film. It follows the life of a young Irishman, which fate has fighting in the armies of several countries before he's able to marry a rich widow. Through this character's example the film seems to be showing just how random life is, with precarious turns of events leading to entirely new chapters, as well as how foolish people are, fighting duels or marching to their deaths in senseless wars. Lyndon robs others and is robbed, he loses and wins fortunes, and he acts as a scoundrel and as someone with grace. Unfortunately the lead role is played by Ryan O'Neal, who is a weak link in an otherwise superb cast; his uneven (often non-existent) accent is awful, and he fails to give the character a sense of swagger. His character is not very sympathetic either, but a scene where fate is especially cruel is still devastating. And in the end, we see that regardless of our scurrying about, ultimately we pass away and become equals in death:""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor they are all equal now.""",Barry Lyndon
29,g-bodyl,Very Fine Filmmaking!,9,9 July 2014,"Now there are some people out there who may call this film, Barry Lyndon very dull and pretentious. But I found this film to be quite gripping and masterful in telling the story. This is cinematic art, and art at it's finest. There are going to be no blazing action scenes or no potty humor, but this is a film that take it's own sweet time to tell the story.Stanley Kubrick's film is based off a book from William Shakespeare and it tells the story about the rise and fall of an Irish rogue as a member of the British aristocracy. We see how this man, Redmond Barry goes from a soldier in the British's army to a man who marries a fancy widow.The acting is very good. But outside of Ryan O'Neal, there are really no famous faces here. I think that is good because with a famous cast, that may distract from the story. Some even go as far to say that Kubrick is the best ""actor"" of the film. That being said, his directorial techniques are very active in the film and this film is a directorial success for the legend.Overall, Barry Lyndon is a vast epic that requires your complete attention. It does a good job in drawing your attention in. This is a film I would call as ""lost art,"" because nowadays, we do not get to see films like these. This film features excellent technical skills and the cinematography will capture your breath. This is an epic that ranks as one of Kubrick's best films, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I rate this film 9/10.",Barry Lyndon

31,inkblot11,"A masterpiece, Thackeray would undoubtedly be dazzled himself with Kubrick's work",10,21 April 2011,"Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a son of Irish parents who, while not wealthy, are fairly comfortable and semi-sophisticated. Unfortunately, Redmond's father has died and his mother and he live in a large family house with cousins and such. One female cousin, Nora, is Redmond's first love, as she, somewhat older, is not yet married and a definite flirt, even with a young relative. Finally, the family makes a match for Nora with a British officer but, Redmond challenges the man to a duel, where Redmond is the quicker draw. Thinking his rival dead, Barry's mother gives him a stash of guineas and urges her son to go elsewhere until things cool off. Unknown to Redmond, however, is the fact that the officer was hit with a non-lethal bullet and survives to marry his cousin anyway. More bad luck follows, as Redmond is robbed on the road of his money and horse and has no other choice but to join the British army. At first happy with the food and benefits of the Redcoats, Redmond's first real battle changes that contentment, as the horror is revealed. Thus, Barry makes plans to assume the identity of a fallen soldier and escape. It seems to go well in the beginning, as Barry meets a beautiful young German widow (he is in Prussia at the time) and spends a few lovely days with her. All too soon, his lies are revealed and he is pressed into the more severe Prussian army, for a number of years. From there, he becomes a small-time hero, meets up with a professional gambler who, likewise, wants to escape to a new venue and, eventually, our Redmond finds himself in the same social circle as a most beautiful aristocrat, Honoria (Marisa Berenson). Honoria is a married lady, with one young heir, but her well-connected and older husband is very ill. Sensing Redmond's attentions to his wife are more than friendly, the lord's anger at the situation hastens his death. After the ""proper"" mourning of a year, Redmond marries Lady Lyndon and assumes the name of his wife, too, becoming Barry Lyndon. In almost no time, the two are at odds with one another and this upsets the family's heir (Leon Vitali) to the point where he loathes his new stepfather. Although Honoria welcomes a second son, Bryan, who is spoiled by his doting father, Barry's situation is precarious, as his mother points out, on a visit. The death of Lady Lyndon who be a disaster for Redmond and his son, as the true heir would kick them out of their glorious mansion and render them penniless. Is there another way to get a title, so that Barry can stay in the posh circles of life? With his life a series of good luck, bad luck, nothing is certain, n'est-ce pas? This is a motion picture masterpiece, based on the literary classic by William M. Thackeray. The story is sensational and Kubrick chooses a narrator to help move the tale, as it is a long one. Then, too, the cinematography and the director's avid attention to the details of the time period, including scenes shot by candlelight, make it a sumptuous view. Costumes and sets are beyond description. The actors, somewhat secondary to this, are nevertheless quite fine, with O'Neal giving an uneven but stirring turn. Berenson has less to do than look lovely but her character's nature is weak and she shows it. Vitali is sensational as the brooding heir and Patrick Magee and all of the other, lesser names give it their all. I, unfortunately, waited 35 years to watch this stunning, impeccably-crafted film.

Sure, if your favorite movies are ""Transformers"" franchise, you shouldn't bother with this piece. For all the rest ""Barry Lyndon"" will be a movie gem.Everything here works on highest cylinders and creates a deep, rich and unforgettable motion picture. The story and storytelling are amazing. I was captivated from opening scene till the very last end. At running time 180 min. this period costume drama never drags and is involving from start till finish. The production values are a first rate. Cinematography, costumes, music, acting, directing and script are on the highest level. I will be honest, i just watched ""Barry Lyndon"" for a first time, and i have to admit it, i enjoyed it more than ""Shining"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" - two very powerful pictures. That's i think because story telling in this movie is flawless. It is done so well, so simple that you are drowned into the story totally - can't remember when last time i was so captivated by a story.Overall, ""Barry Lyndon"" is a true classic, and after seeing it i can totally agree. It has everything that a great movie must have. If you somehow didn't see this picture yet, do yourself a favor and do it. Take your time, because this movie is very long, but it is done so well, that time will fly fast watching this gem.10/10.",Barry Lyndon
33,sol-,Trying to find your place in the world,9,13 January 2017,"Best thought of as a film about uncertainty in life, this engrossing Stanley Kubrick drama chronicles the ups and down of an eighteenth century man whose fortunes constantly changes. Growing up, 'Barry Lyndon' was never one of my favourite Kubrick films; after all, the uncharismatic title character never changes very much and lacks personality. The narration also tends to reveal key events too early on for them to retain an emotional punch. A recent rewatch of 'Barry Lyndon' with 'A Clockwork Orange' fresh in mind was a revelation though. While one is set in the past and the other is set in the future, the two movies actually have a lot in common as they deal with young men trying to find their place in cruel and unfair worlds. Barry's breaking down into tears when unsure whether to spy on the Chevalier is reminiscent of Alex being kicked out of his parents' home with the same uncertainty of where to go and what to do, having been displaced from a once-familiar life. Emotionless as he sometimes seems, Barry makes for a highly sympathetic character too. Early in the piece is labeled as ""but a boy and does not signify more than (a) parrot or lap dog!"", while later he is referred to as a ""common opportunist"" and the film is mostly about Barry trying to change what others think about him for the better. Whatever the case, the film is very well tied together by the employment of non-original music, adapted from the likes of Schubert, Bach and Mozart. Almost every scene is set to music of some sort, and the final duel near the end is given nail-biting tension by the sombre music throbbing in the background.",Barry Lyndon

It's a truly epic film with a sprawling runtime and methodical pace. From the very beginning, we see his impulsive and tempestuous character running into deep conflict with everyone around him, a theme repeated many times in his life. Another big theme we encounter is Barry's opportunistic trickery, used to escape the army, scam gamblers out of money and suck the Lyndon estate dry. These are portrayed in lingering scenes that resemble paintings, showing the reactions and thoughts of everyone in a way that allows for visual contemplation.",Barry Lyndon
35,Thanos_Alfie,The story of Barry Lyndon...,7,3 March 2015,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a drama movie in which we watch a man's story who is a young farm boy in love with his cousin Nora but Nora gets engaged to the British Captain John Quin. After this we watch him joining the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. And also after he joins the Prussian Army and when he finish with the army he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon.I liked the plot of this movie but in some times it was a bit tiring. Also I believe that there was no need for this movie to a be three hour movie but two. Although the direction which made by Stanley Kubrick who also has written it was as I expected magnificent. I also liked the interpretation of Ryan O'Neal who played as Barry Lyndon and he was really good at it. Another interpretation that I liked was Marisa Berenson's who played as Lady Honoria Lyndon.Finally I believe that ""Barry Lyndon"" is a good movie to watch and I think if you watch it you will enjoy it. I also have to say not to have many expectations of action and be reasonable because it's a 1975 movie and think of this before you criticize it.",Barry Lyndon
36,Dr_Coulardeau,Cold ambition against cold selfishness,9,14 January 2007,"An old film that has aged tremendously. The rhythm is slow, too slow, and it lacks any kind of feeling or sympathy or compassion. It is cold, very cold. This is the portrait of a social climber who is blocked and rejected when he has finally reached the top. Then it becomes the story of his downfall. He has a lot of luck in his life, but he essentially is a coward who uses the army to get out and away, a deserter who shifts from one side to the other, a spy who double-cross everyone, a gambler who cheats all the time, and a gross ruthless and uncouth person who uses every means at his disposal to get to his ends, even women of course. But the film shows how he is then defeated more by misfortune than by any real plan. He is defeated by the young lord whose mother he has conquered, and the details show that this young lord is even worse than the one he gets rid of, his stepfather, a vomiting retching little coward who takes advantage of the very only moment of generosity his stepfather actually demonstrates in his whole life, and this only one time towards him. He surely recovers his estate and gets rid of his stepfather but he recovers no honour, and yet Kubrick does not go that far. He stops short of saying that, though he shows it with the very last images of a sad, selfish, embittered young man who has suddenly gotten older than his age. What could have attracted Kubrick in such a story ? I can only see one answer : the deep cruelty of human beings and the unfathomable inhumanity of human society, aristocratic or not. That may explain the whole career of Stanley Kubrick : human society is nothing but a computer gone berserk.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Barry Lyndon
37,johnnyboyz,"When you think of 'Kubrick', you should think of 'Lyndon'.",7,2 September 2006,"When thinking of the directing legend Stanley Kubrick, some of the films that may spring to mind could be his sci-fi '2001: A Space Odyssey'; maybe his ground breaking and controversial 'A Clockwork Orange' or maybe even his wonderful turn at horror in 'The Shining'. One film that perhaps won't immediately hit you is this one; 'Barry Lyndon' and this is a great shame.The one thing Barry Lyndon has going for it all the way through is the feeling of luck/chance. The film is impossible to predict and this instantly makes it good as it grabs you and draws you into its world. It also does this with its wonderful collection of 'mise-en-scene' on display. The costumes are out of this world, the continually mole-faced characters are delightful as they are juxtaposed for their time and the settings are as consistently different and refreshing as each other.When I was watching this film, it felt like some sort of gritty crime drama set a few hundred years ago. Lyndon's climb up the aristocracy's hierarchy sneaks up on you a little bit as you realise that he's got to make something of his life given the position he's now facing. All this is kicked off following a nicely done and particularly moving love story early on. The brutish, overly confident British soldier/captain has spoiled Lyndon's love interest and everything is set up superbly for the actual incident to happen. Once the journey starts, you can't tell which way it's going. While totally engrossing and maintaining that luck/chance feeling throughout the first hour, 'Lyndon' sucks you in and doesn't exhale for a moment. Everything that happens is an experience and keeps you interested as to what the outcome might be.What also struck me about the film is that at times, you have no idea what the characters are even saying. From memory, the characters interact in German and some form of 'Prussian' and the gyp is: there are no subtitles (!) However, this isn't a bad thing in fact it adds to the experience. It would be spoiled if some tacky looking 1970's style font popped up telling what it is everyone is saying. It gives you the feel that you're actually there with them and it's great.Unfortunately, no film is without its flaws be it length or otherwise and the film suffers from this. During 'part 2' of the film, and especially during his married life; the film falters. The character settle down and it feels like he's reached the end of his journey until something pretty unpredictable and shocking kick starts it again, but this is quite a while later. There isn't much energy in the film, the narration dries up and the settings stays the same. In fact, it's rather dull at this point.But, as I've mentioned, something kick starts it again and it's back on the road of unpredictability and anguish.Definitely one of the most under-rated films of the 1970's and shouldn't be forgotten when thinking of Kubrick's best films.",Barry Lyndon
38,Petey-10,The melancholic life of Barry Lyndon,9,3 October 2009,"In a small village in Ireland in the eighteenth century there lives a young man by the name of Redmond Barry.He is in love with his cousin, Nora Brady.But Nora engages to the British captain, John Quin, and Barry challenges him for a duel of pistols.He wins, only to find out later that there were no real bullets used.But Barry has led to Dublin, and he joins the British army after being robbed.He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian army.He want to climb the social ladder, and marries Lady Lyndon and becomes Barry Lyndon.When we look at the masterpieces by the great Stanley Kubrick, Barry Lyndon (1975) is often overlooked.I personally can't understand that.The movie is beautiful as a painting.The movie is not dull as many people say, especially in our modern world.In the world where fast speed is required in order to stay awake.The pace of this movie is just right.It gives us the right image of the 18th century.Kubrick also made the movie without recoursing to electric light.It meant shooting in candlelight.That's also one thing which makes this film look more real to the period.Ryan O'Neal does a remarkable job as Barry Lyndon.His character is not the most likable, but you can't hate him either.Eventually you even start to pity him.Marisa Berenson does distinguished job as Lady Lyndon, who becomes deeply depressed after she marries Barry.The movie has a lot of silent scenes, scenes that need no words.Lady Lyndon and Barry at the gambling table exchanging lingering looks is one such a scene.The scene where Barry beats up Lord Bullington is harsh.The duel between them in the end, which leads to amputation of Barry's leg at the knee, is a classic.It is most touching when Barry's son Bryan is dying after falling off a horse.Then there is his funeral, and you hear the music being played loud and the reverend speaks his words.The classical music that we hear in this music is masterous.There's Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Antonio Vivaldi, Franz Schubert etc.The piece that's associated to the film is George Frideric Handel's Sarabande.Ludwig Leonard Rosenman won an Academy Award for Best Musical Score for adapting the various pieces of baroque and classical music.A very fine movie, a very fine movie indeed.",Barry Lyndon

Every few years I give this movie another go and after it's over I ask myself why did I bother. It is a beautiful movie to look at. There's no denying that. But it's a movie filled with uninteresting characters. I very quickly lose an interest in Barry Lyndon and what he's up to. The main problem is Ryan O'Neal. He's not a good enough actor to pull this movie off. I do enjoy many of his movies but this one is out of his league.

40,SAMTHEBESTEST,With due respect to Stanley Kubrick i won't care about Barry's senseless story ever again..,6,30 May 2020,"BarryLyndon (1975) :
Brief Review -With due respect to Stanley Kubrick i won't care about Barry's senseless story ever again. This is probably Stanley Kubrick's weakest narrative i have seen. The director who is known for free minded and brutal filmmaking choosing this novel and rewriting it in such a senseless manners is unthinkable and unacceptable for me. Barry Lyndon is a fictional tale of a naive boy who wants to become a gentleman. Then he falls in love with the wrong girl (who is after rich men) after rejecting her himself, well are you really reading any sense? Suddenly he wants to fight for her and his fate takes him to other place and other profession. After spending time in army and one time-pass affair with a married woman he goes into gambling business and then marries a wealthy countess to aquire her property. Then he has several affairs with other women and end up losing everything under burden of debts. Okay so am i really supposed to connect with this senseless story and all the senseless characters? I couldn't find a single sensible character in the film. I couldn't find Barry sensible at all to connect myself with his character or any other character in the film. Every non sense things happens so easily in the film and we were asked to believe every foolish conflicts in long 185 mins screenplay. I don't know what made Kubrick to choose this script after delivering 4 Classic films before it when he could have gone for any script from his favoured genre. I don't wonder why this film flopped and had been rejected by audience at the time of it's release. Sometimes even genius people go wrong and this was Kubrick's turn. Overall construction of the film is good enough for eyes to bear. The film won 4 Oscars for technical achievements and that makes film watchable so you can watch it but just don't expect some good cinema or Clasic stuff.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",Barry Lyndon
41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,What's luck go to do with it? Kubrick strikes again,9,21 September 2012,"Don't let the powdered wigs fool you — ""Barry Lyndon"" is a Stanley Kubrick film through and through. To many it comes off as the filmmaker's period stepchild, but his hallmarks shine in this portrait-esque telling of an Irishman's rise and fall in social status at the hands of what can only be considered luck.This biographical epic derives from William Makepeace Thackeray's 19th Century novel loosely based on legendary Irish fortune-hunter Andrew Robinson Stoney. Published in serial form and then turned into a novel, Thackeray's tale is said to be one of literature's very first instances of an unlikeable hero.But Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) wasn't always that way. In fact, it's not until Act II when he assumes the mantle of Barry Lyndon that he becomes a figure one might not be so inclined to root for. Even with his brazen ways in the beginning as he leaves Ireland and finds himself in both the British and Prussian militaries during the Seven Years War, you can't help but hope fortune looks kindly upon him after his early-life woes.Kubrick's lengthy telling of this tale allows us to see the complete rise and fall of Barry without skipping many beats. His pursuit of a wealthy lifestyle begins as a teenager when he falls in love with his cousin who ditches him for a wealthy military captain who will bring the Barry family lots of wealth. In a jealous rage, he challenges the man to a duel and kills him, forcing him to flee the area, but he finds out not much later that the ball was a dummy round of sorts. Redmond was set up so that the family could keep him out of the way of the marriage. At this point a Red Coat himself, he determines to climb his way to the top by any means necessary.Despite the period look, ""Barry Lyndon"" plays out more as an 18th Century fantasy adventure. Redmond is never in the same place for long until he marries Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) at the start of the second act and his misadventures have a humorous bent to them. He finds himself in all kinds of predicaments and dealing with all manner of people. Instinct and luck lead him on a roller coaster that peaks at his achievement of wealth by marrying the Lady Honoria. Then, of course, it goes straight down.Guiding the film is an omniscient narrator who both foreshadows and offers keen insights, especially into the themes and ideas at play in the film. It also helps to frame the film as a portrait of a man's life. Kubrick's visuals echo this concept in the way he films every scene as if it's a painting. Only a few scenes, namely the more visceral ones in which there's fighting or something of that nature influences him to move his camera freely about. The technical aspects of the film are among the best of any of Kubrick's works. The costumes, cinematography and music create this moving tableau that keeps the film exciting even if a particular part of the story dulls momentarily.The performances are among the least memorable of Kubrick's films, but that's not to say they're poor. O'Neal has the challenge of always being 30 years old in real life but acting like Barry at different stages of his life. The blend between these stages lacks the necessary smoothness, but O'Neal excels at the all the emotional high points and finds ways to generate our sympathy in spite of Barry's inherent flaws.The rest of the cast either have or are made up with striking visual features. Kubrick and frequent casting director James Liggat find actors who really stand out, an important feature in both creating the tall-tale effect of the film but also in helping keep multiple characters separate in a time period in which conformity was the style. Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt, for example, has such a distinguished face that simply enhances the film. Of course it helps that Kubrick was a master of close-ups on faces.""Barry Lyndon"" shares some story characteristics with Kubrick's other films, namely in a man's transformation, a character or mankind's corruption, over time. Many of his works detail how war or violence ruins men, and while that's here too, it's told in a more biographical manner with an emphasis on luck and fortune or misfortune. What we discover at the latest by the film's one-sentence epilogue is that Kubrick didn't necessarily believe in luck's influence on the whole story, but he was nonetheless fascinated by how in this time period, the actions of men could be misconstrued as just luck one way or another. The social hierarchy, if you will, created a perception of powerlessness in one's own life to change social circumstances. Kubrick loads the film with innumerable scenes featuring duels and card games, but based on the outcomes, the characters involved always seem to make their own luck.Sure, ""Barry Lyndon"" could be considered the least commercially viable of Kubrick's films, but it is their equal as far as the director's mastery.~Steven CThanks for reading!

42,funkyfry,Classic costume epic may be Kubrick's masterpeice,10,15 February 2003,"Kubrick at his very best, in a ponderous film about a less than heroic main character, Lyndon, who lets no human values get in the way of his quest for power and wealth.  The film doesn't let us simply dismiss the often unpleasant (to say the least) Barry, however, forcing us to sympathize with his dreams and the sadly human means he uses to find his personal immortality through the acquisition of titled nobility for himself and his progeny.  Kubrick almost lets his glorious picture of the period overpower the characters, but it is plausible that this was his goal.  A very adult period peice that blows away all Hollywood epics before and since, and pointed the way for James Ivory's superior efforts along the same lines.",Barry Lyndon
43,Anonymous_Maxine,"So different, and yet so much the same...",9,11 February 2008,"The first thing that struck me as I started watching Barry Lyndon (which I'll admit that I knew almost nothing about when I put it on) was that it's a period film, something that I have definitely not come to expect from Kubrick. Granted, I'm a little behind in my detailed look at his filmography, given that more than a quarter century passed between the film's release and me finally getting around to watching it, but I very soon began to see the same Kubrick that I have come to know and love.The film is about a man named Redmond Barry, who we love and then hate and then pity and then admire for his luck and then pity, love, hate, etc. And the most interesting thing about him, of course, is the sheer magnitude of events that happen to him, given that he never for one second has even the slightest bit of control over his own life.He begins with a childish crush on his own cousin, which leads him to engage in a foolish duel, the results of which force him to flee his home without much plan of what to do with himself, other than make himself scarce until things blow over. And we witness the beginning of his truly bizarre adulthood, during which time he is robbed and forced to join the British Army basically just because he had no other choice, and then an increasingly unexpected series of circumstances and events take place that ultimately lead him to the most unexpected conclusion.The film itself is structured in an interesting way, in that it is filmed and presented with such an emotionless detachment. As Ebert pointed out, there is a narrator that gives away any important events in advance to remove any sense of tension or suspense, and he narrates as though he were talking about field mice rather than real people. As such, the film is able to come across more as an exploration of Kubrick's ideas of human nature rather than another cloying period romance. Bravo! I have read (and am not surprised by) a lot of people saying that the movie is intolerably boring, which I must say is to be expected. Like so many Kubrick films, it is prohibitively long at just over three hours, and it is interesting in that it gives a feeling that nothing ever happens from beginning to end, and yet there is ALWAYS something happening.Personally I absolutely loved it. It reminded me of another unique and enormously entertaining period film, Tom Jones, with it's brilliant comic performance by Albert Finney. Recenltly I have been going back and watching all of the Kubrick movies that I haven't seen as of yet, and even at it's prodigious length and slow pace (which is a Kubrick trademark if I've ever seen one), Barry Lyndon is still one of my favorites, at least of the overlooked classics. It is a bit of a commitment, but well worth it.",Barry Lyndon
44,jzappa,The Pomposity of Greatness,10,19 April 2009,"Some people find Barry Lyndon a unique, as a result of being remote, effort in a sort of transcendental film-making. Others find it a pretentious flat tire. I shake my head at the latter view. How can anyone be bored by such a daringly resolute film, unless they've become such sleepy filmgoers that no movie can make an imprint on them unless it complies to their expectations? Stanley Kubrick's three-hour adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque tale, which succeeds transcendently as a film which experimented with film stock, lenses and natural lighting, may not be a great entertainment in the traditional sense, but it's a reckless augmentation of directorial clarity: Kubrick saying he's going to make this text work as a model of the way he sees the world. The chamber music saturating the soundtrack is so delicate and sophisticated yet so primitive, as is the setting and time.This four-time Oscar-winning period film is substantially hostile in its deliberate coldness. Many of its turns take place offscreen, the cleverly opinionated narrator tending to tell us what's about to happen and we learn long before the film ends that its hero will die broke and unfruitful. This disclosure doesn't much dishearten us, because Kubrick has directed Ryan O'Neal in the title role as if he were an oil painting. He would be a dauntless man of power were he not seeing tunnel vision.And the film has the pomposity of greatness. Aside from how much it cost, how many years it was in the making, not being the commercial success Warner Bros. had been hoping for. How many directors would have Stanley Kubrick's self-assurance in taking this body of history and drama, this basically small yarn of a young man's rise and fall, and completing it in an approach that ultimately bids our approach to it? We not only see Kubrick's movie, we see it in the mindset on which he demands.His title character is a young man to whom things occur. Barry appears to take hardly any knowing charge over his life. He falls into a short-sighted adolescent love, quickly has to leave the community after a duel, enrolls just about inattentively in the British Army, fights in Europe, defects from not one but both sides, falls in with significant and shady compadres, marries a woman of affluence and charm and then devastates his own world because he misses the morale to endure in it. And all of these things feel capricious. Young Lord Bullingdon, Lady Lyndon's son by Sir Charles, despises Barry from the start. The marriage is not a happy one, yet they celebrate a new son. Barry enjoys himself and philanders whilst keeping Lady Lyndon in apathetic isolation.The key is that the Baroness's son is another Redmond Barry. We're reminded of the righteous renegade young Barry. And we see through the depictions of the world around him that conquering was the inclination to acquire love. He was conquered as a young Irishman, as the rejected third of a love triangle, thus his likewise response was to conquer one's rivals, which heightens the intensity of the Baroness's pain and desperation when she is subjugated by him after being of such dominant distinction. In the end, who's conquered who?",Barry Lyndon
45,Vartiainen,A Scoundrel's Tale,7,29 August 2018,"You have to hand it to Stanley Kubrick. The man has range. All of his movies are acclaimed classics, many of them are regarded among the best in their respective genres and they cover a truly astonishing range of different subject matters. With this movie that being a period costume drama.Barry Lyndon is at its heart a picaresque story, which is a Spanish novel type where the story follows a young man, often coming from a lower social class, trying to improve his lot in life, often mixing with the high class aristocrats. The style is often satirical, even comedic, despite the grim happenings and bleak tone. And that's essentially this film in a nutshell, though I certainly hope that in the original novels, the main characters are more likable.Yet, while I do not like Barry Lyndon (Ryan O'Neal) as a human being, the whole film is still very watchable. The set pieces are stunning - with Kubrick trying to mimic the paintings of the era and largely succeeding - the costuming is great and while the plot is very slow and deliberate, it's still endlessly intriguing. The events are also refreshingly diverse, with Barry experiencing very different kinds of adventures throughout his life.Is it Kubrick's best work? I don't think so. The technical aspects are once again groundbreaking, the depth of detail is astonishing and the sheer mastery of his craft is evident in every frame. But, the story just isn't as unique as in his other films. I'm more impressed by the technicalities than I am with the so-called meat of the film.Very much worth a watch even still, don't get me wrong.",Barry Lyndon

A big task for the maverick director. For a film like this to be made during the free wheeling seventies had to take some big stones. One must admire Mr. Kubrick for even trying to produce and direct such a complex and expensive film that had all the ear markings of a financial and personal disaster. Not only did Kubrick manage to out do his last epic ""2001"" but he has created a movie that not only showcases the untapped acting abilities of Ryan O'Neil, but a beautifully lensed film that uses minimal lighting , gorgeous sets, perfect balance, positioning and meticulous timing. I have never seen such a magnificent film such as this one. Every shot and frame plays out like an eighteenth century oil painting.A young Irish man of lower class has the strangest quirk of luck. After participating in an illegal duel, young Barry is forced to flee from his home village. After being accosted by some gentlemanly highway robbers, Barry winds up cross country and becomes a conscripted soldier. Rising in rank, Barry is sent to fight in the Seven's Year War. Whilst in battle he watches his friends and fellow soldiers being slaughtered in combat due to poor tactics and leadership. Having enough of this life of hardship and struggle, Barry uses his god given talents to do what he has to do in order to survive and become a man of proper social standing.I was very impressed with this movie. I've put off watching this film until recently. Some have told me how long and boring this movie was. Others have said it was pretty self serving and not worth watching. But after seeing part of it on T.C.M., I just had to find a copy of my own. The film is over three hours in length but they go by very quickly because Barry's story is so captivating. Kubrick poured his heart and soul into this film. The results are on the screen. He's clearly a master film maker. His reputation is cemented forever with this movie. Ryan O'Neil impressed the hell out me with his role as Barry Lyndon. He gives the character some dignity and depth that no other actor could have possibly given to the title role.Overall I would have to give this film one of my highest recommendations. This is one of my top ten films of all time. If people tell you not to watch this masterpiece ignore them. I advise you to get a copy and enjoy. For a film like this you need to set aside a weekend afternoon to fully appreciate a film such as this. Believe me you will not regret it.Highest recommendation possible.It doesn't matter whether you watch it on D.V.D. or V.C.D. because the transfers are excellent on either format.",Barry Lyndon
47,jamesrupert2014,Magnificent costume drama from a master director,10,26 November 2017,"""Barry Lyndon"", William Makepeace Thackeray's tale of the rise and fall of young Irish ne'er-do-well Redmond Barry in late 18th century Europe is brought to the scene by legendary auteur Stanley Kubrick. The cinematography is outstanding as Kubrick was experimenting with a number of high-aperture lenses originally developed for NASA to allow filming in minimal light, allowing him to shoot candle-lighted interiors in ambient light. There are also extremely long-distance wide-angle shots of the English countryside and long-distance pull-back zoom shots. There was some criticism of Ryan O'Neil's limited range as an actor when tasked to play such a complicated and central character and the long film (184 min) moves at a very languid pace (ultimately, not a lot happens), but I found the story interesting and the character development superb. Overall, ""Barry Lyndon"" is a beautifully crafted 'costume drama' and if a bit of patience is required to see the story through, it is well rewarded.",Barry Lyndon
48,st-shot,Kubrick's beautiful museum tour bore.,6,24 December 2018,"Stanley Kubrick offers up end to end JMW Turner landscapes along with some eye popping portraiture of 18th century styled Marisa Berenson in this stunningly photographed visual masterpiece lensed by John Alcott. But given its lengthy running time featuring a dreadfully miscast Ryan O'Neal as the title character it amounts to little more than a museum tour; and even The Louvre gets tiresome after three hours.
Youthful Redmond Brady falls for his cousin Nora, getting himself into a duel with an English Army Captain and killing him causing him to flee Ireland, be waylaid by highwaymen, join the army, desert, sleep with the farmer's wife, join the Prussian Army, hook up with an Irish card sharp and marry into title and property the massive success he had hoped to become before a swift downturn in fortune.In the hands of a capable actor of the day, Barry Lyndon may well have ranked as one of Kubrick's better films but O'Neal simply rings hollow from end to end going from an overgrown chubby cheeked young adult to a dissipated, aging old man with the healthy glow of Malibu Ryan still in evidence. His lilt is a timid wisp and Kubrick's incessant close-ups of his lifeless look of hurt an indignation after awhile can no longer be assuaged by Stanley taking us on frequent trips to the country.Michael Hordern lends the imagery and the dignity it demands with his narration while chamber orchestras bang out Vivaldi, Bach and Schubert among others to present us with one gracious tableau after the next but with O'Neal as the linchpin to this picaresque journey across the magnificent countryside of Ireland and GB the picture staggers more than gallops.Kubrick himself bears blame with a running time that includes four duels, the first offering one of the film's more expedient moments while two others run inexorably overlong. His mesmerizing candle lit interior shots at times seem like they will run the length the stick or at least until the band takes a break.Barry Lyndon may be the prettiest girl at the dance by far but it lacks the energy of Tom Jones (1962) before it, along with Albert Finney and a magnificent supporting cast carrying it along at break neck speed. It also had an outstanding look but more importantly a heart and vitality that Lyndon lacks barring it from the pantheon status that its look commands.",Barry Lyndon
49,MaxBorg89,"A damn fine period piece, carried by a charismatic Ryan O' Neal",10,24 July 2007,"Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray is, reportedly, the first novel in the English language to feature an anti-hero. Stanley Kubrick's film version retains that aspect to perfection, thus becoming a slightly different period drama from what we are used to.The main character is an Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O' Neal), a con artist who, after killing a rival in a duel, starts traveling around Europe looking for wealth and power. With his charm and ability with words he manages to eventually rise to the upper classes by marrying the recently widowed Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), even though said marriage is far from happy, due to Barry's most annoying talent, that of bringing misery and ruin wherever he goes.Given his perfectionistic reputation, the words ""Kubrick"" and ""period piece"" must have sounded like a magical combination, and indeed it is: the Clockwork Orange director handles every technical aspect of the film with absolute professionalism, from the candle-lit cinematography to the astonishing costumes to the marvelous production design (all of which were given Academy Awards), ensuring one element everyone remembers about this kind of film (the visual seductiveness) is pitch-perfect.The other classic ingredient in costume dramas is a touching love story, but that is not something Kubrick would have told, fond as he was of tales of solitude, unhappiness and destruction. The first is a characteristic of Barry, the other two are what he has a habit of causing: as noble as his intentions may be (and they rarely are) and no matter how close he gets to the right people, he is doomed to remain alone, his own wife being unable to accept his opportunistic schemes. Nevertheless, there is a kind of smugness (in a good way) to him that makes him less unlikable than expected, and O' Neal's charismatic performance (complete with decent accent) keeps the character away from anything resembling a one-dimensional caricature of the average con-man, providing a lightness of touch which saves the film from becoming too bleak during its long running time (almost three hours).Last, but not least, Barry Lyndon would not be half as good without the classical music used as soundtrack, each melancholic tone proving a perfect companion to the humorous but fundamentally sad tale of (lost) love, power and abandon.A must-see for fans of period pieces, Lyndon is also unusual by Kubrick's standards, its lighter tone being a neat counterbalance to the darker subjects the director explored in Paths of Glory, The Killing and A Clockwork Orange. Yes, it is very long. Yes, it requires multiple viewings to be fully understood, just like every other Kubrick movie. But it is also, like all of the notorious perfectionist's pictures, infinitely rewarding and considerably less unsettling than his more famous works.",Barry Lyndon
50,Lechuguilla,Obliquely Napoleonic,7,2 November 2012,"In the early 1970s, Director Kubrick wanted to make a film about Napoleon. For various reasons, that effort failed to materialize. But Kubrick put his research on Napoleon and that historical era to good use later, in a story about a fictional character of that same time period, Barry Lyndon, a roguish young Irishman whose ambition and opportunism would carry him into splendorous surroundings of Europe's high and mighty, despite one setback after another.In ""Barry Lyndon"" what we get is thus a Napoleon-like character: clever, charming, calculating, and commanding. And we follow this character over an extended period of his life, as he interacts with the grandiose and powerful, en route to a destiny dictated as much by uncontrollable fate as by his own selfish desires.Given the film's very slow pace, I like the way the unseen narrator explains the plot as it proceeds. Such a script device ensures an overview approach to the story, so that we don't get lost in details. Implicit here is the nullification of both suspense and mystery. The title character's ever-changing circumstances, however prosaic, and his responses to those changes, are what matter. The narrator functions thus as an impartial, emotionless observer, a stand-in for Kubrick himself.Production values rate quite high as does the cinematography. Interior scenes especially look really good, with those lit candles amid colorful costumes and makeup. Indeed, some scenes convey an air of romanticized unreality, as characters pose like statues in a museum. The classical background music thus completes the Enlightenment-age mood.""Barry Lyndon"" is a period film with colorful costumes and some interesting characters. With a runtime of three hours and a big budget, it comes across as self-conscious and forced. Its stiffness, as displayed in stagy acting and stilted dialogue, renders it hard to like. I found it not particularly entertaining. But the film does succeed at giving viewers a Napoleon-like character, and a pretty good feel for what life must have been like among the aristocratic elite in that time and place.",Barry Lyndon
51,MissSimonetta,The Kubrick movie that made me a fan,10,24 June 2019,"I was introduced to the work of Stanley Kubrick at a college screening of 2001, a film I appreciated but did not love. Years later, a chance viewing of BARRY LYNDON on TCM, motivated by my interest in the 18th century, reintroduced me to Kubrick and got me totally obsessed with the man's films. I have seen all Kubrick's movies and out of all his features, I only love A CLOCKWORK ORANGE more than BARRY LYNDON, which, on an objective level, might be his most perfect movie.That BARRY LYNDON is gorgeous, no one will contest, not even the film's fiercest detractors. However, for me, the film's story, with its sense of irony and dark humor, make it a classic. And despite the claims that Kubrick movies are all cold, there are a few moments that really hit you in the gut. I even confess that one scene in particular made me weep and continues to make me weep every time I revisit this masterpiece.",Barry Lyndon

That's the feeling I got from Barry Lyndon.As another reviewer put it, this movie is ""3 hrs of pretty pictures and wooden characters - not one involving personality."" Well, maybe that's a bit harsh, but overall I agree that not one of the characters was sufficiently engaging. Just after the halfway mark (after hearing the same 8 bars from Handel's ""Sarabande"" played for the 7324512th time) I was about ready to pull the plug.But I'm glad I stuck around til the end. Like I said, the grandeur of production was enough to make it worthwhile, and the plot picked up in the last 30 mins. My rating swung back from a 4/10 to a 6/10.I just wish the characters had souls. Even the reviewers who rated this a 10/10 hardly mention the acting; they focus on the technical and visual merits instead (which I agree are 1st class... though perhaps lost on some of us non-film-school folks).But someone's gotta say it: People born in California should NEVER be allowed to do Irish, Scottish or British accents. I say this about Ryan O'Neil as well as Keanu Reeves and Julia Roberts. Well OK, Julia wasn't born in California, but her accent in Mary Reilly was awful just the same. And yeah, I know Keanu was born in Lebanon, but he'll always be a surfer dude to me.Bottom line: if you're a fan of Kubrick or Thackaray, you'll probably enjoy this. But since no one on Earth has ever finished a full Thackaray novel (admit it, you just bought the Cliff's Notes in high school like the rest of us), I think we can narrow this down to Kubrick fans only.",Barry Lyndon
53,Kdosda_Hegen,Manipulation in the old times.,6,5 February 2021,"This film is about a very selfish and manipulitive character who seeks good for himself only. It's a very long and quite slow film, it has epic music and some great cinematography, but the film has such an unlikable protagonist that even the great story becomes not as interesting.",Barry Lyndon
54,slokes,See The Pretty Pictures,6,31 January 2006,"The same things that make ""Barry Lyndon"" interesting are what make it problematic. Long drawn-out scenes, lingering close-ups of stiff-faced actors, no rooting interest, a sudden personality shift (for the worse) in the lead character, and minute attention to period detail that seems director Stanley Kubrick's main reason for making this.Kubrick shoots his 18th-century costume drama, based on the William Makepeace Thackeray novel, with nods in the direction not of other filmmakers but rather period painters like Gainsborough and Hogarth. His frame, often moving but slightly in the course of a scene, captures moments of wondrous, intense beauty which seem to defy gravity in their not-quite static state, such as a woman in her bath or a man riding across a country path. For that, it is a unique film, one that transfixes many still.Still, it's a hard film to love, at least for me, starting with the main character, a young Irishman named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) forced to flee his homeland after a duel who gets himself trapped in not one but two armies in the middle of the Seven Years' War. He escapes with a tricky gambler to Belgium where he meets Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) who falls in love with him and offers him an opportunity to rise in the highest realms of society, if only he can control his mendacity and bitter temper.Not a lot to love there, and some say it's either O'Neal's fault or Kubrick's for casting him. O'Neal is in typically wooden form, but this is one film that serves such an acting style, as the cast here converses less in dialogues than colloquies while barely moving so much as an eyebrow so as not to disturb Kubrick's delicately candlelit interiors. O'Neal surprises on occasion, especially late in the film when he delivers a crying scene as powerful as Russell Crowe's in ""Gladiator."" Once you get past his weak Irish accent, you may find him as good a man for the job here as anyone.There's also nice character work by Murray Melvin as the dour minister Mr. Runt, Leon Vitali as Lady Lyndon's son by a prior marriage, and Steven Berkoff, unrecognizable as the same man who menaced Eddie Murphy in ""Beverly Hills Cop"", as a foppish dandy who trifles with Barry to his regret. Patrick Magee, often over-the-top on screen, nicely underplays his part of the gambler, Barry's tutor for a time. Kubrick's work with the child actors here showcases his exceptional, undercommented work in that department.This is one Kubrick film where there is little overacting. It's hard to overact when you can't even move. Kubrick is so bent on making with his pretty pictures that any droplets of vitality dribble off the screen. Audience identification, too, is hard, except I think some of the charm of this film is in how alien it is, presenting a world we think we know in an askew but somehow more real-seeming way than ever before.It's a triumph in ""Barry Lyndon"" how fine and layered a visual scheme Kubrick is able to put on screen, and the story, especially in its first half when Barry is on the rise, has its compelling moments. A mordant narration by Michael Hordern that carries on for the length of the film seems intrusive at first but gradually turns out a rather sublime counterpoint to the action on screen. You come to need Hordern after a while. At a little over three hours, one feels like one is sitting through Barry's wastrel life in real time. Some may see that as an accomplishment, but you can only stare so long at a painting, even a masterpiece, before yawning sets in. It sets in more quickly here.",Barry Lyndon
55,Steffi_P,"""I'll duel him, if I have to follow him into the church""",10,29 January 2007,"Barry Lyndon, if not one of Kubrick's most underrated pictures, is certainly his most unjustly overlooked by many of his fans. At first glance a period drama culled from a work of 19th century literature may seem completely at odds with the innovative and in-your-face look of Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange, but it is perhaps the most carefully considered work by a director at the top of his game.Apparently the source novel is one of its authors less well known works, but its structure and themes were perfectly suited to Kubrick. Kubrick's films can usually be seen as being made up of contrasting segments, and Barry Lyndon is in fact formally separated into Parts One and Two. Part one is the rise of Barry, Part two is his downfall. The two parts can be seen as mirror images of each other, and there is a sense of history repeating itself, particularly with the two main pistol duels. Barry's story begins with his duel with Captain Quinn. It ends with his duel with Lord Bullingdon. Both duels are between a young man and an old man. Both duels are (essentially) over a woman, and in both cases the younger man is a relative of that woman who has a somewhat inappropriate love for her, whereas the older man is or will be her legitimate husband.Kubrick further contrasts the two halves of the story. Part one is largely set outdoors, and all the most important scenes take place in the open air, signifying Barry is at first an outsider. This is in contrast to the luxurious interiors of Part two. The music changes throughout the picture from delicate folk airs, to pompous military marches to stately classical pieces. Kubrick goes to some pretty excessive lengths to add little subtle touches that signify the changes in Barry's position. For example, if you watch carefully in the first half, you'll notice that every time there is a candle-lit scene, the number of candles on the table increases by one each time.Of course, all these symbolic touches don't really add much to the story. What is the real key to Barry Lyndon's brilliance (and also the reason it isn't more popular) is its pacing. It is incredibly, indescribably slow. There is no abbreviation. Every little event, every encounter is played out at in full as it might really have happened. Establishing shots are held for so long that they almost become miniature scenes in themselves, and act to set up chapters in the story rather than the next scene. This is not simply a life story stripped down to the exciting bits, it really feels like a life story. Two things prevent the film from becoming mind-numbingly boring. Firstly, every shot is beautifully composed and lit, so if nothing else the film is nice to look at. Secondly is the way Kubrick handles the emotions.Emotion is nearly always understated in Kubrick's films. His characters tend to hide their emotions, and Kubrick rarely uses any cheap devices to make things too obvious. The emotions in Barry Lyndon are at their most understated. All the dialogue and conduct is highly formal and ritualised, in keeping with the period setting. But paradoxically the emotions are also constantly on display. Throughout these unbelievably long drawn out set pieces the characters are constantly betraying their innermost thoughts and feelings through subtle gestures, body language, tones of voice and facial expressions. Kubrick actually makes more use of close-ups than in any of his previous pictures, far subtler than what is generally called a reaction shot, but the characters are constantly reacting all the same. The world of Barry Lyndon is one in which the characters say one thing, yet think and feel another. When eventually we do get to see a very openly emotional scene – little Brian between his mother and father – the effect is incredibly powerful, like the floodgates have finally been opened.With all this considered the actors all do an amazing job, and the casting is perfect. Marisa Berenson is particularly good, keeping her face blank and expressionless, but showing very strong emotion just beneath the surface. There is a great supporting cast too, for example Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, who helps keep that slightly bizarre and silly feel that is in all Kubrick's pictures. This is not to mention Michael Horden's narration, which gives a spot-on tone of friendliness with a touch of sadness.Barry Lyndon is really a refreshing take on the period drama. All too often period films and historical epics simply duplicate the stuffy, formal manner of their source material. Barry Lyndon on the other hand transcends its literary roots and, while sticking to the language and story of the novel, shows a very genuine humanity in the characters. It never forgets that, no matter how much they are constrained by the conventions of the time and place, people still experience the same emotions. It's not the most entertaining of all Kubrick's films, but it is an amazing achievement nevertheless.",Barry Lyndon
56,ShootingShark,Staggeringly Beautiful But Ultimately Hollow Costume Drama Of Rake's Progress Through Eighteenth-Century Nobility,6,20 July 2008,"In the eighteenth century, Redmond Barry is a young Irishman who leaves home after duelling with an English army officer, and begins a series of adventures in Europe which ultimately result in marriage to Lady Lyndon, a widowed Belgian aristocrat. However, will his new-found wealth and status bring him happiness ?Are movies art ? This movie, perhaps more than any other, forces the viewer to answer that question. If there was an award for most gorgeous, naturally lit, exquisitely framed imagery, this must be at the top of the list. You can literally freeze it at any point and it could be a landscape by John Constable, Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Turner or any of the great Rococo painters. For me it represents the ridiculously talented Kubrick's most complete work, but embodies both the best and the worst aspects of his style. The best because everything about it is so beautifully manicured and perfectly crafted. The worst because within the amazing attention to detail and technical brilliance it is soulless - cold, humourless, drab, boring, slow and disinterested even in its own story. It's almost like A Clockwork Orange turned inside out; whereas that film is about the passions of youth exploding out of the modern ghetto, this one is about the stuffiness of middle-age fitting into historical social convention. I sometimes think Kubrick took all the criticism of his previous film being savage, vulgar and immoral (which it isn't) and turned in the most restrained, classiest, prettiest, poshest upper-class tableau he could, simply to silence his detractors. It certainly gained acclaim, winning four Oscars (of which he got none) and influencing many - the great Ridley Scott's first feature, The Duellists, is almost a sycophantic young fan's remake, and people like Merchant-Ivory made an entire career out of replicating the look of it. In my reviews I often try and describe movies from a technical perspective, but there's no point here - everything is just perfect, that's all there is to say. There isn't a single frame that could be improved upon. The problem is the plot and the characters. Neither the events of William Makepeace Thackeray's 1844 novel, nor the general tenets of the bewigged costume drama interest me in the slightest. I don't care about Barry, the other characters (especially Lady Lyndon) are ciphers, and the drama - the love affair with Nora, the sudden confession to the Chevalier, the death of the child, Barry's self-sacrifice in the duel with Bullingdon - have no fizz, no pep, they just lay there and wash over you. The acting is faultless in the sense that everything is determined by the style, and the cast is great, including several of Kubrick's stock troupe (Berkoff, Quigley, Rossiter, Sharp, Stone) and Vitali, who went on to become one of his most important assistants. However, I simply can't watch the film as straight drama - it's turgid beyond belief. I love it though, so every time I see it I simply ignore the plot and bathe in John Alcott's astonishing photography. Each one of those long, slow, pullbacks is just astonishing to me, as is the fact that all the candlelit interiors were shot with just natural light, employing the most massive lenses ever used outside of serious astronomy. This, combined with the gorgeous music (notably Handel's unforgettable five-note Sarabande in D-minor for harpsichord), result in an incredible sensory overload to be treasured. I just don't believe it's a complete movie experience. Around the same time that Kubrick made this, another director I like, Larry Cohen, made a movie called God Told Me To. That movie is a piece of trash - it looks rubbish, it was shot hastily and cheaply, Cohen probably edited it in his sleep and it was shoved out into theatres without any thought. It lacks everything Kubrick's film has. But it's a better movie. It's a better movie because the script has more interesting ideas every three minutes than Barry Lyndon does in three hours. Every character is unique and fascinating, the plot is gripping, crazy, exciting, suspenseful, original and clever. It makes you feel alive to watch it, which the Kubrick film does not. I started by asking if movies are Art and they are; Barry Lyndon is proof positive. But they are not Classical Art, they are something else (which is often why highfalutin critics look down their noses at them). Kubrick's standards were the highest of any filmmaker and his movies cannot be missed, but in some ways they are also great folly, odes to a style paragon that doesn't encapsulate what cinema is really about. Don't miss this great film, but see the rest of this remarkable director's work too.",Barry Lyndon
57,adamjohns-42575,An Epic Undertaking!,1,10 April 2021,"To say that it's a bit of a long one is an understatement. Be prepared to sit for a long time or to watch it in two sittings. I actually think a lot of it could have been shortened, especially the duelling towards the end. My only theory is that Kubrick was trying to set a new record for the longest film ever, especially as you get closer to the finish and it seems like there has been less and less editing.I won't say that it's a bad film, but I would have to think carefully about making such a timely investment to watch it again.It actually starts off quite well as an interesting tale of a boy with a need to get out and learn a few things, who goes to war and still doesn't really find his direction, but rather drifts along wherever the wind blows. When he finally meets Viscountess Lyndon you think that he is going to learn how to be a ""Proper"" man and settle down, but it doesn't really work like that and I found myself disliking the man he had become and losing interest quickly. This is when everything slowed down incredibly and it became a bit more 'Sense and Sensibility' with its romance and etiquette and a bit less 'Hornblower' losing the adventure and fight.It may be that I have seen too many 'Carry On' films, but this one seemed to have a comedic element to the way it was made. Michael Horden's narration made me think of the antics of 'The Wind In The Willows' and the Chevalier played by Patrick McGee looked just like John Cleese alongside Potzdorf who looked like Benny Hill. I was half expecting a bikini clad group of girls to start chasing around the fields or for Charles Hawtrey to pop up and say ""Hello"" in that camp old way.As with most films older than me, I would like to see a modern filmmaker give this a new treatment and hope that they would find something in the original Thackeray story that was missed in this version. I'm sure they could find lots of fat to trim at least, shortening it to something more easily manageable. It might even make a good TV series, broken down in to several episodes.Lastly, I have to say that Ryan O'Neal's Irish accent was horrible to listen to. Really cringeworthy.At least I can cross it off of my list of films to watch as recommended by the BFI (British Film Institute).",Barry Lyndon
58,truemythmedia,One of the Most Beautiful Films Ever Made,9,14 June 2019,"While Barry Lyndon is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, it's not as talked about as some of Kubrick's other work. It's not as profound as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", not as exciting as ""Full Metal Jacket"", not as funny as ""Lolita"" or ""Dr. Strangelove"", not as rousing as ""Spartacus"" or ""Paths of Glory"", not as messed up or ironic as A Clockwork Orange, nor as terrifying as The Shinning. While I personally wouldn't say this is one of my favorite Kubrick films, I can appreciate its beauty and the brilliance that went into making a movie this epic. The story is that of a man who is a scrapper and a gambler, and its fun to watch a rogue rise through the ranks of an aristocracy where he doesn't fully belong. There are some brilliantly intense scenes in this movie, as well as some wonderfully comic ones, and the mise-en-scene alone makes this film worth watching.",Barry Lyndon
59,davidmvining,"Gorgeous and involving, Kubrick's other masterpiece",10,26 November 2019,"If I had to boil down the ideas of this 3-hour visually sumptuous experience to a single word it would be artifice, and it's highlighted by the very first shot of the film. Like many across the runtime, this first look at the world of Redmond Barry feels like an 18th century painting come to life. Kubrick starts with two figures filling opposite sides of the frame before he zooms the camera out to reveal a stone wall that occupies much of the lower third of the frame, a large tree that fills the left half, and a blue and cloudy sky occupying the upper third. It's so elegantly composed as to feel like it comes from another era, and it's showing the audience a duel. It's the duel between our main character's father and another man, leading very quickly to the elder Barry's death over, as the wonderfully realized and written voiceover explains, a matter concerning a horse. We learn no more about either Redmond's father or the matter that took his life, but the execution of the elder Barry's single scene is illuminating to the heart of the film as a whole.What we have is a highly ritualized form of violence being followed over concerns of something rather petty when compared to the life of a man. No matter the cause, the elder Barry consented to this ritual in order to do something positive for himself. Was it worth it? Was it any different from any other form of violence like a drunken brawl? Once caught in the ritual, did the elder Barry ever have a choice in the matter, or must the form be followed no matter what?There are two more duels in the film, and they highlight this question in ever more interesting ways. Jumping ahead a couple of decades, the film follows the younger Barry, Redmond, as he falls in love with his cousin Nora. Nora childishly plays along with this infatuation until she makes the acquaintance of a British officer named John Quin (almost ridiculously acted in a wonderful performance from Leonard Rossiter) whom she immediately falls in love with. Barry won't stand for this insult to his honor, so, after Nora and Quin announce their engagement in a manner Quin intends to insult Barry, the young Irishman challenges Quin to a duel.Quin, though, is an abject coward. It's obvious that he's the kind of man who can stand up to a boy without fear, but as soon as that boy is holding a loaded pistol, his firm looks quiver into fear. However, Quin is as much a part of the system of 18th century British society as Barry's father had been, so he follows through with being part of the duel. He cheats, though. He has Nora's brothers (who oversee the duel and have a vested interest in getting their sister to marry a member of the English gentry) load the guns with tow. Barry hits Quin square and Quin passes out from the shock and fear that had gripped him, despite knowing that his life was not in actual danger. Barry, not knowing Quin's health was unaffected by his shot, flees to Dublin, leaving his old life behind.The third duel comes much, much later in the film, so we'll get to it in due time. Redmond is robbed on his way to Dublin and ends up joining the army in an effort to make a living and start on his path towards becoming a gentleman, a journey that takes up the first half of the film. He's roped into the Seven Year's War (or, for us Americans, the French and Indian War as the American theater of that conflict is called) and quickly becomes miserable with his existence. There's a fight with another soldier, a boxing match, that acts as a very interesting counterpoint to the duels in the rest of the film. The duels are filmed very squarely with long takes, but this boxing match is all handheld cameras and quick cuts, implying the more grounded and ""real"" nature of the type of conflict. Anyway, Redmond steals an officer's uniform to flee, heads into Prussian territory, and gets captured by a Prussian officer who sees through Redmond's lies and shanghaies him into the Prussian army where Redmond spends the rest of the war. Afterwards, he's forced to investigate an Irishman living in Prussia. Redmond and the Chevalier develop a close bond very quickly based on their shared heritage and distance from home, eventually finding a way to get Redmond out of the country and free from Prussian rule.Once the two begin making their living as traveling gamblers, Redmond sees the Countess Lyndon and falls in love with her, a type of love that is greatly different than what he felt for Nora. His time in the British and Prussian armies has left him completely jaded, perhaps even dehumanized, so all he sees in her is an income. They marry and their lives, based on nothing more than Redmond's quest for the status of a gentleman, is deeply unhappy. The Countess' son to her first husband, Lord Bullingdon, instantly dislikes Redmond, seeing right through the artifice of his appearance and manner to discover the rake he truly is. After some years, and the birth of a son, Lord Bullingdon can't take Redmond's profligacy, infidelity to his mother, and general mistreatment of himself and leaves only to return after the accidental death of his younger brother and the utter collapse of the Lyndon fortune at Barry's hands.And...we finally get our third duel. This one is an interesting third manifestation of the ritual. Redmond seems to harbor no further ill will towards Lord Bullingdon in the wake of his own child's death, but Lord Bullingdon is still consumed by hatred for Redmond. In his excitable state, Lord Bullingdon, who had been granted first shot, accidentally fires his pistol into the ground. Redmond, feeling none of the animosity towards Lord Bullingdon that the younger man feels for him, fires into the ground intentionally. Presented with an opportunity to walk away with his honor intact and satisfaction satisfied, having followed the ritual and artifice of violence to a natural conclusion, Bullingdon rejects the offer and elects to fire again. This time he doesn't miss, hitting Redmond in the leg (which he will eventually lose), and gaining what he really wanted, exiling Redmond from England and his life. Bullingdon submitted to the artifice to get the violent ends he wanted and he took it as far as he could. The artifice in this instance did nothing to protect anyone, and Bullingdon used it to get a very non-artificial result.The artifice of the film extends to other elements, such as performance. The characters most invested in the artifice of the world give the least naturalistic performances. In particular I think of Murray Melvin as Reverend Runt. Runt is the spiritual advisor to the Lyndon family and tutor to Lord Bullingdon. He wears the white powder on his face that marks most of the aristocracy we see in the film, and he speaks in extremely measured tones. His place in the world hinges entirely on him fitting in with the upper classes, so he's happy to strengthen their hold upon the world no matter what. When presiding over Barry's wedding to the Countess or reading over Redmond's dead child, he speaks in the exact same tone of voice. It is only when Redmond's mother dismisses him that Runt gains an element of emotion in his voice. She's stripped the need for any artifice from him and he can suddenly speak his mind fully.In contradistinction, there are some characters who speak extraordinarily naturally throughout. The first and most obvious of the first hour of the film is Captain Grogan, the man who tells Barry of Quin's plot to escape death at Redmond's first duel. He cuts right through the bull and simply tells Redmond what really happened. The ritual of the duel means nothing to him, so he's free to speak his own mind.So, that's all well and good, but why like the movie? I've spent almost 1500 words talking about meaning and theme and a bit on performance, but why like this film?Well, first of all, I find it both gorgeous to look at and completely hypnotic. In some ways, these are traits that it shares with 2001, but this one looks better, I suppose. Compositions are lush and deep and wonderfully built. Using mostly natural and candlelight, Kubrick was able to create a sumptuously beautiful world from beginning to end. I particularly love the candlelit scenes (using lenses developed by NASA, apparently). I also find it completely engaging. Redmond becomes almost as despicable a character as Alex from A Clockwork Orange, and the journey is so well realized. From his impetuous youth to his jading experiences in the army and as a gambler, to his ruinous exploitation of another person's fortune to unsuccessfully advance his own personal interests, I find Redmond Barry utterly fascinating and watchable.Another element I love is two-fold. The two act structure of the film and the movie's tendency to say what's going to happen through voice over and on title cards long before they happen. For instance, the very first title card of the film that preceded the very first shot tells us how the first act will end with Redmond Barry gaining the title of Barry Lyndon. The title card for the second act does the same thing, describing his fall, and there's voice over more than half an hour before the end of the film telling us that Barry will die childless, alone, and in poverty. The inevitability of his rise and fall is so well handled that it gains an element shared with Greek tragedy. He's destined to fall because his fall was always within him. As the voice over says, the qualities of gaining a fortune and maintaining a fortune are not the same thing.",Barry Lyndon
60,Spleen,I can't believe that there are people who find this dull.,10,11 March 2002,"In fact it's one of Kubrick's most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of ""Dr. Strangelove"" (and it's unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s).  English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into ""the trap of the picturesque"", but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don't have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.THIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it's cut altogether - you won't catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it's about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don't.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick's musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert's name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I'd been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.It's a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he's responsible for: ""Spartacus"" (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) ""2001"" (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and ""Barry Lyndon"".  The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.",Barry Lyndon

62,onepotato2,Completely avoids the obligation to entertain,2,27 March 2008,"A slow movie isn't necessarily a bad movie. Often when viewing a slow movie, it's still possible to detect and enjoy a director's intent. In outwardly dull movies such as Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation,' Kubrick's own '2001,' and 'Being There,' the movies are actually teeming with subtext, and exciting ideas which afford a view of what the director intended to explore. I cannot find any such quality in Barry Lyndon. I am unable to even guess why Kubrick wanted to make this. It's difficult to see what excited him about the project. How does the social rebellion of 'A Clockwork Orange' and '2001' dissipate into this constipated movie by 1975? Kubrick foregoes both entertainment and camera movement to a Puritanical extent here. The movie is also homophobic. It's filled with sophomoric tableaux lifted from Hogarth's 'A Rakes Progress,' which still don't answer the question, ""What's the point?"" If I don't care about the obvious level of a movie, I don't feel any compulsion to look for symbolic or thematic value.

Special lenses were designed to shoot interiors and exteriors in natural light. In one scene Barry (Ryan O'Neil) was having a dinner with a German woman who was feeding her baby and the candle light made the whole scene look like a Caravaggio's painting. This is just one of many scenes. Each of them is perfection and harmony. Costumes and sets were crafted in the era's design. Age of Enlightenment with its gallantry, wars, and duels, had been recreated in the film with the precision of the celebrated landscape and portrait masters of the period such as Thomas Gainsborough; Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy of Arts; George Romney to name just a few. If nothing else, watching BL is pure aesthetic delight - and there is one man who responsible for it, Stanley Kubrick.

""Barry Lyndon"" is the most compelling and compassionate realization of the inevitable finality of everything in this world which was presented by the visionary director with elegant sensual melancholy. Stanley Kubrick known for his detached, seemingly remote and non-sentimental style chose to reach out to his viewer directly during the epilogue, ""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personalities lived and quarreled, good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now"".

Generally I don't enjoy a ""style over substance"" approach to filmmaking, but ""Barry Lyndon"" is a movie that really shows what a genius Stanley Kubrick was. William Makepeace Thackeray's novel really isn't that fantastic, to me by far the weakest story Kubrick has ever adapted. But the imagery he gets out of it, all the shots that look like Renaissance paintings, the utter coldness (nobody has emotions until the last hour) with which he tells the story makes this a true classic. And then there's the other Kubrick trademark I adore: keeping the pace as low as possible without ever getting boring. The duels for instance take ages, but that's mainly because we're dealing with someone who knows what suspense is. Who minds that it takes the duelists roughly half an hour to cock a pistol, Kubrick knows he can take as long as he likes because you always want to know what happens next. The only thing that's kind of shame is that the studio forced him to hire Ryan O'Neal, who is wrong for the character and robs the movie of some of its incredible charm. If this had a better lead, it may have been the best film (Kubrick has) ever made.",Barry Lyndon
66,bandw,A perfectionist director comes close to achieving his goal,10,9 October 2012,"Common opinion has it that this is perhaps the most exquisitely beautiful film ever made. It is certainly the most beautiful I have seen. After the first half hour I was doubtful if the level of quality could be maintained throughout; it was. The story takes place in the second half of the eighteenth century and traces the history of one Redmond Barry, a man of modest birth who rises to marry a baroness, Lady Lyndon, only to later lose it all. This comment is not a spoiler, since a narrator frequently tells us what is about to happen and the on-screen titles:Part I. By What Means Redmond Barry Acquired the Style and Title of Barry Lyndon.Part II. Containing an Account of the Misfortunes and Disasters Which Befell Barry Lyndon. take away any major suspense.The story is told in a series of episodes, each one perfectly composed and paced. I am in awe of how much time must have gone into making this. The research on period details and dress had to be extensive. The battle scene between the English and French armies was stunning, involving hundreds of actors all dressed in full uniform. This reminded me of the battle scene in ""Spartacus"" between Spartacus and the Roman armies of Crassus, only the armies had rifles this time around. Kubrick knows how to stage such scenes--the battle scene is just one of many I watched again after having seen the whole movie. It is not surprising that there are long time gaps between Kubrick movies.This is one of the few movies that fully engaged me even though I did not have a strong emotional commitment to the main characters. I was captivated by a presentation that has the feel of a dispassionate scientific investigation, it's like I was viewing specimens under a microscope. In witnessing the arc of Barry's entire life the movie drives home how we are all shaped by random events and our emotions, neither of which we have much control of. As the narrator asks, what would Barry's life have been if he had not fallen for Nora? What if he had been able to control his behavior toward Lord Bullingdon? Questions we all ask ourselves: what would my life have been if I had done this, or not done that, or if some event had not happened? Ryan Oneal does not have an enormous range as an actor, but he is well cast in his role here, since Barry is externally passive. This is not to say that he is emotionless: he precipitated a duel over his love for Nora, he came to the aid of a comrade in battle, he loved his son, he violently attacked Lord Bullingdon and fired into the ground as a point of honor in his duel with Bullingdon. I was impressed by how well Oneal carried off the boxing scene, later to find out that he had been an amateur boxer as a younger man.The musical score plays an essential role; the movie would lose much of its impact without it. Period classical pieces are perfectly chosen to enhance the experience. After having seen this movie who will ever forget the Andante movement from Schubert's Piano Trio no. 2, or the Sarabande from Handel's Keyboard Suite in D minor?Kubrick cannot be accused of producing movies that are variations on a theme--every one is a unique work of art. It is hard to imagine what current director would have what it takes to gamble on making a visionary movie like ""Barry Lyndon."" The only movie in recent memory that I can think of that could be in this category is Malick's, ""Tree of Life.""",Barry Lyndon
67,tomsview,Kubrick and Thackeray; on the same page,10,28 November 2014,"Although the choice of stars in some movies seemed odd at the time they were made, over the years, they have grown into their roles.Ryan O'Neal in Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" is a classic example. Back in the 70's he was a pretty big star, but seemed connected to more lightweight fare. It was a surprise when he ended up in a major film from Stanley Kubrick.These days, he doesn't carry the baggage that surrounded him back then and now seems quite an inspired choice to play Redmond Barry, a brash, impulsive, Irish opportunist during the Georgian era in England and Ireland. After many adventures, he rises from lowly beginnings to become a gentleman of means, only to slide back down again in an even more spectacular fall.Along the way he marries a beautiful widow, Lady Lyndon (Marissa Berenson) and makes an arch enemy of his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). Kubrick wrote the screenplay from William Makepeace Thackeray's novel. Thackeray had a witty turn of phrase - for example, at one point in the novel, Redmond Barry beats the living daylights out of young Lord Bullingdon, which Thackeray refers to as ""administering a correction"". Kubrick catches Thackeray's satirical tone and the script is full of wry, Thackeray-inspired observations on the human condition. Apart from anything else, the script itself is an impressive achievement.Thackeray wrote the novel in the first person from Redmond Barry's point of view whereas Kubrick uses the voice of an anonymous narrator, speaking in the third person. Although narration can sometimes seem a lazy way of telling a story in a film, it works perfectly here; we find ourselves waiting for the commentator to put Barry's often-painful experiences into perspective.Kubrick changed the story a great deal, without losing the essential themes. I can't help feeling that in a couple of areas he actually improved it, especially the ending, which in the novel is rather meandering - instead of the decisive duel of the film, Barry's fortunes run down, and he eventually lands in prison after being given ""a tremendous castigation"" by Lord Bullingdon. Kubrick tightens the whole thing and that long, final confrontation is one of the most powerful scenes in the film.This movie has a brilliant look whether indoors or out, night or day. What an amazing talent Kubrick was. Jack Nicholson once said of him, ""Everybody pretty much acknowledges he's The Man, but I still feel that underrates him"". He was a guy from New York who could embrace British literature and history, and produce such a believable work as this - it was almost as though he had Thackeray himself sitting in a canvas chair beside him acting as technical adviser.The true genius of the movie is in how Kubrick captures the period perfectly, maintains that beautifully measured pace, and yet delivers a film that is full of wit and tension from beginning to end.",Barry Lyndon
68,Takethispunch,"Slow, lengthy but good one",10,5 January 2017,"An omniscient (though possibly unreliable)[7] narrator relates that in 1750s Ireland, the father of Redmond Barry is killed in a duel over a sale of some horses. The widow, disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to her only son.As a despondent young man, Barry becomes infatuated with his older cousin, Nora Brady. Though she charms him during a card game, she later shows interest in a well-off British Army captain, John Quin, much to Barry's dismay. Nora and her family plan to leverage their finances through marriage, while Barry holds Quin in contempt and escalates the situation until a fateful duel beside a river.

69,DeeNine-2,"Lavish, engrossing, picaresque",10,6 February 2002,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Stanley Kubrick's beautifully opulent production takes many liberties with William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque romance, The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq (1843), narrated in the first person depicting events from the eighteenth century. In particular, Redmond Barry who becomes Barry Lyndon, is something of an admirable rake, whereas in Thackeray's novel he is a braggart, a bully and a scoundrel. No matter. Kubrick, in keeping with a long-standing filmland tradition, certainly has license, and Thackeray won't mind.Ryan O'Neal is the unlikely star, and he does a good job, rising from humble Irish origins to the decadence of titled wealth, employing a two-fisted competence in the manly arts, including some soldiering, some thievery at cards and a presumed consummate skill in the bedroom. Marisa Berenson plays Lady Lyndon, whom Barry has managed to seduce; and when her elderly husband dies, she marries Barry thus elevating his social and economic station in life. But Barry is rather clumsy at playing at peerage, and bit by bit manages to squander most of the Lyndon fortune until his stepson, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali) grows old enough to do something about it.This really is a gorgeous movie thanks to the exquisite sets and costumes and especially to John Alcott's dreamy cinematography and a fine score by Leonard Rosenman. The 184 minutes go by almost without notice as we are engrossed in the rise and fall of Barry's fortunes. There is fine acting support from Patrick Magee as the Chevalier de Balibari and Leonard Rossiter as Captain Quinn, and a number of lesser players, who through Kubrick's direction bring to life Europe around the time of the Seven Years War (1754-1763) when decadence and aristocratic privilege were still in full flower.The script features two dueling scenes, the first showing the combatants firing at one another simultaneously at the drop of a white kerchief, the second has Barry and his stepson face each other ten paces apart, but due to the flip of a coin, the stepson fires first. Both scenes are engrossing as we see the loading of the pistols with powder, ball and ramrod, and we are able to note how heavy the pistols are and how difficult it must be to hit a silhouette at even a short distance. It is this kind of careful attention to directional detail that absorbs us in the action and makes veracious the story. Notice too the way the British soldiers march directly en mass toward the French guns. They actually used to fight battles that way! Also note the incredible pile of hair atop Lady Lyndon's head. Surely this is some kind of cinematic record. Bottom line: one of Kubrick's best, certainly his most beautiful film.",Barry Lyndon
70,frankde-jong,A technically perfect film,9,26 June 2020,"""Barry Lyndon"" is unanimously regarded as a technically stunning film. Special lenses had to make sure that candle light in interior surroundings looked natural.In my opinion Stanley Kubrick is a master in using music in his films. A good example is ""2001: A space Odyssey"" (1968), but Barry Lyndon"" is his Magnus Opus in this respect. All the music is from the same period as the story (Schubert, Bach, Handel etc) and is perfectly combined with the individual scenes. Listen to the music accompanying the duel scene between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, just like a thunderstorm approachting from afar.""Barry Lyndon"" is a picaresque film. In such a film the main character has obvious flaws, but is sympathetic all the same. Most of the times the film has a happy ending for the main character. Just look at""Tom Jones"" (1963, Tony Richardson).Barry Lyndon however is anything but sympathetic. He is selfish and treats people who care for him badly. The film is a rather symmetrical ""rise and fall"" film in which the trickery and deceit that helps Barry in the first half, turns aginst him in the second.The film ends decidely in a minor key. The negative view on human nature that permeates the film was responsible for the fact that the film didn't do well at the box office. Later the film was rehabilitated artisticly, but that didn't help Kubrick much to get enough finance for is his much cheried Napoleon project (which, if realised, would be situated in roughly the same time).",Barry Lyndon

72,PimpinAinttEasy,My favorite movie of the 70s,10,31 July 2013,"I guess this is one of Kubrick's most underrated movies. Every frame is like a painting. Just like in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and EYES WIDE SHUT Kubrick uses the expressions of characters (like the accountant cunningly looking at Barry and his wife as they write cheque after cheque slowly leading to ruin) to convey what is really going on in a scene. He uses dolly out shots quite frequently in this movie, as if slowly revealing parts of a painting. There is dolly out where a young Lord Bullingdown is gazing at a magic show - pensive and uninterested, but when the camera moves backwards and more characters are revealed we see Barry Lyndon, his wife and his mother all looking happy and laughing at the magician.Kubrick also uses these exceptional and easily distinguishable actors (like Leonard Rossiter who plays Captain Quin, Patrick Magee as Chevalier de Balibari and Marie Kean as Barry's mother) to create tremendous impact. Actors in Kubrick movies are often used as special effects. The way Rossiter marches in as Captain Quin and the way he dances with Barry's cousin and lover create an immediate impact on the viewer. Patrick Magee is tremendous. He just has to be in the frame for example the way he stands at Barry's wedding, it is amazing. His caked up face conveys cunning as well as tenderness. And Mary Kean smiling grotesquely in the scene with the magician is also pretty unforgettable. Kubrick often uses these wonderful an grotesque actors to create small but memorable and unforgettable characters - like the sinister waiter in THE SHINING inspiring Nicholson to commit great unspeakable of violence, the Russian costume shop owner in EYES WIDE SHUT, the cruel warden and the crippled writer in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE etc.And a few words about the duel between Barry and his stepson Lord Bullingdown - that scene was better than any Mexican standoff in a Sergio Leone movie. Tt was a slow burn, Kubrick raises the tension gradually without using any musical score, almost as if a ceremony is being conducted. Kubrick shot this great scene in 1975. And created a similar scene of almost equal or greater impact in EYES WIDE SHUT,nearly 25 years later when tom cruise's character is found out at the orgy and is questioned by the master of ceremonies in front of all the attendees.The outdoor scenes are beautiful, conveying the idleness of life in the 18th century. The indoor scenes convey the richness of life (for the aristocrats), with the paintings in the background and servants to assist even for the smallest activity like shaving.Ryan o Neal plays Barry Lyndon with a dourness that sort of predicts the eventual decline and fall of the character. And like i mentioned earlier, the supporting cast is stellar. I thought some parts of the movie like the sword fight scene and the one where Barry beats up his stepson were hilarious. Watching this movie is a pleasure. It is like having a huge sandwich or cake with many hidden layers. Or drinking fine wine (10/10)",Barry Lyndon
73,bobsgrock,A history lesson with Kubrick.,10,24 January 2009,"No doubt for those of us that like to indulge in a little history lesson every now and then, it is hard to find a movie that so perfectly captures the realistic portrayal of people in earlier parts of the past millennium. Here, the great Stanley Kubrick has captured and frozen a part of time that will last forever. Taken from a European novel, the story is that of a young Irish rogue who takes it upon himself to rise up in the social class and make a life for himself. How he goes about this is quite unique and interesting, as well as the way Kubrick invites us the audience to partake in this journey.Nearly every scene is so perfectly lit, designed and dressed, it simply sweeps you up in the times of eighteenth century England. The dialog is outstanding, including the narration. The costumes and sets are immaculate and nearly steal away from the drama itself. Most of all, Kubrick has given us a look into the past and what it meant then to be someone and all the hard work it took to matter. Certainly not for everybody, with a running time of three hours and a very slow pace, Barry Lyndon will polarize some people. For Kubrick fans as well as history fans, however, it will amaze, dazzle and uplift as one of the very finest works of a great director and a great period in human history.",Barry Lyndon

76,sharky_55,"The grim, invincible enemy",10,5 April 2016,"Barry Lyndon is a visual and technical marvel if there ever was one. Kubrick's infamous desire for perfectionism down to the tiniest details meant shooting to mimic natural light in order to capture the pure essence of the late Baroque period. The iconic candlelight scenes had to be shot with a special lens with a tiny f-stop in order to capture as much of the light possible and cast a faded glow across the scene. But he also had to juggle this with the small depth of field that would contradict the flatness of the compositions which he had so meticulously designed. The use of the zoom out/ins over the dolly is crucial to this process; the zoom allowed Kubrick to preserve the scale in his sets (a zoom would be like blowing up a picture) where a dolly would have marred the perspective. Add to that the gorgeous mise en scène and production design, and the catatonic, still-life quality of the staging and you have the often point of praise that each frame becomes an 18th century painting in itself. So we see a tender close-up of grasped hands or a despondent mourning face, and then outwards, the bigger, colder picture. These characters seem trapped by the time period and their respective settings. In the first act we see Redmond and how he came to be Barry Lyndon - the impulsive, love-struck warrior that doesn't want to fight but will do it for his personal causes, whether it is to win a lady or save his own skin. And repeatedly as the zoom outs do, in an anti-picaresque way, we see how there are larger elements beyond his comprehension and control which push him towards that high estate, the pinnacle of his 'wealth'; the conspiracy to get him out of the picture of Dora's betrothal, a fellow soldier sneakily offering him choice insults, or the gambling prowess of Chevalier (a sort of play on the idea of luck itself, but it is never Redmond's hand that deals the card). And then in the second act O'Neal's expressionless, one-note performance finds its little niche, drowning his sorrows in drunken stupour, senseless violence and all the marks of a man gone to seed. He stumbles into wealth as easily as he wastefully leaves it, but even in his lowest moment Kubrick does not relent stylistically. The final, detached text seems to confirm this; a smothering and suffocation of the greed and degeneracy of the wealthy aristocratic noble class through stylistic narrative, forgotten in death even as the narrator paints a vivid picture. It is from this voice-over that the narrative dissonance is created and where Kubrick subverts. In one instance the narrator gives an old cliché; that war read from the comfort of an armchair is much removed from the reality and horror of experiencing it for yourself. And yet the battles in Barry Lyndon are staged beyond realism; the soldiers are arranged in geometrically straight formations in order to cater to Kubrick's zooms, and they march onwards and upwards even as comrades fall all around like they have been programmed to (a thematic counterpoint to Kubrick's envisioned Napoleon). Redmond is the only one to fall back and comfort a friend in his last breathing moments - in the first act he has still that tiny vestige of compassion and humanity. And he parts on decent romantic terms with a lonely German mother during the wartime...Barry Lyndon does not even offer those little condolences, but openly flaunts his infidelity. Furthering this theme we have a disconnection between the formal narrator and his flowery, historic prose fit for a history book and the way that Kubrick has actually depicted the events of the film. First we have the duels, which are so ridiculous and outlandish in the way they pause at each step for civility and ensure the correct chivalrous procedures have been followed. Their movements are rigid not flashy, and everyone knows when it is over - there is no surprise resurgence or twist. And here you can gleam a little humour too - see how cordial the robbery of Redmond is, and how they seem to cheerfully acknowledge the very meta-fictive script that these incidents seem to follow. In the one instance that Barry does take his own control he is wounded and literally rendered immobile. They are bound by what has already been said of them, or in the case of Redmond's first battle, written over and forgotten altogether. The narrator continually serves to remind us that these events have long been recorded and gathered dust.",Barry Lyndon
77,TOMASBBloodhound,More to it than pretty colors and dazzling visuals.,9,11 December 2003,"The first time I saw it, I wasn't all that impressed, but I gave it another chance and that was all it took. This is a great film. It has a subtle splendor that I've never seen anywhere else. I'm ashamed I'd never heard of it before seeing a documentary on Stanley Kubrick this past summer.I was thoroughly impressed with Ryan O'Neal's portrayal of this 18th century man trying to move up the social ladder of Europe, which must have been nearly impossible for a common Irishman to do back then. He is smug, subtle, calculating, and charming when his character demands it from him. Make no mistake, though. He is no hero. His character is flawed, and he pays the price for it in more ways than one by the end of the film.
There are plenty of things to rave about with this film. As many have stated, it's like watching beautiful paintings come to life in each scene. The background performers all seem to freeze when the camera isn't focused on them. This adds to the effect. I've never seen another film do this. It works very well. The story is paced VERY deliberately. If you care about the characters, this won't bother you a bit. For those out there who cannot stomach long films (and there are a lot of you) this film will be intolerable. Few people I know would enjoy this film, so I would never even mention it to them. There is one thing in particular that bothers me about this film. The way the story unfolds never allows us to get to know many of the characters very well. Since Barry is always moving around from one place to another, we hardly get to know many of the people he meets. Most of them seem interesting, but they're always gone from the story in a flash. One character in particular, The Chevalier, looks like he will be a very influential person in Barry's life, but as soon as Barry weds Lady Lyndon, we never see the Chevalier again! What the hell? Is that what caused Barry's downfall? Losing his mentor? Hmmm.  In sum, this really is a great film. It's actually more than just a film. It's an experience. My advice to everyone who hasn't seen it is simple: Give it a chance. Some day when you have three hours to kill, just turn out all the lights, plop the film in the ol' dvd player and sit back and enjoy it. Most people will appreciate it, but others will no doubt fall asleep. The film is an acquired taste, but a rich one at that!It is certainly worth 9 of 10 stars to the Hound! One last thing: Stanley!

78,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A technical achievement that drags a bit in places.,7,30 December 2020,"As someone who appreciates classic films, perhaps I had my hopes set a little too high for Barry Lyndon (1975). Going in, I already knew the technical challenges director Stanley Kubrick had to overcome to film indoors and by candlelight with no extra lighting. Of course, if that was the main thing I knew about this film before I actually sat down and watched it, that should have told me something about how boring the plot would be. Then again, even a master of cinema like Kubrick can only do so much with mediocre material.I will give some credit where it's due, though. Most of this movie did contribute to the tension of the climax. If certain events hadn't transpired in the way they did, Barry's (Ryan O'Neal) life would have been much different. Then again, the whole ""rags to riches"" storyline seemed overdone, even for the mid-1970s. And sure, duels can be exciting-with the honor and lives of men on the line-but I found this film had more duels than a Yu-gi-oh episode. This contributed to some of my boredom.That's not to say that Barry Lyndon isn't completely unwatchable. Like I alluded to earlier, the cinematography looks fantastic. Most scenes could have easily been oil paintings hanging in museums (probably why the pacing felt so slow). The costuming and music were also exemplary, as would be expected of a period piece like this. I could definitely see where future films (like The Favourite (2018)) drew their inspiration. And while Kubrick's versatility certainly makes this film a good part of his repertoire, I don't think I could place it in my top five favorite Kubrick films.A technical achievement that drags a bit in places, I give Barry Lyndon 3.5 stars out of 5.",Barry Lyndon

80,gab-14712,"Slow-Moving, But Kubrick Does It Again!",9,18 October 2017,"Stanley Kubrick has returned after his 1971's controversial success A Clockwork Orange with his tonally different 1975 feature, Barry Lyndon. His last feature was a movie that was ultra violent and about a totalitarianism society. This movie is different by a wide margin. It has more of a historical value because it takes place in England during the Seven Years' War and we get a sense of English society at the time. It is also based off the works of famed nineteenth century writer William Makepeace Thackeray. This film also has a lovely atmospheric air to it. Kubrick, as usual, masterfully write this feature. You could tell that this is his pet project. However, the movie does clock in at over three hours and with the lack of action, there can be a dull moment or two to be had. After all, I feel the aristocratic world can get somewhat boring at times. That being said, we have Kubrick on the top of his game as he created a valued historical narrative that remains mostly interesting and our eyes are able to feast on perfect costuming and successful camera experimenting. Essentially, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott shot the film without the use of electrical light, and that is why the look of the film seemed a bit odd compared to other films.Narratively, I felt the first hour of the film was the strongest. I found the last two hours enjoyable, but it would be very hard to top the perfect narrative of the first hour. During theS 1700's in Ireland, Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) is a man who is in love with his cousin, Nora. After Nora gets engaged to the British Captain John Quinn, Barry challenges him to a duel. He wins the duel and he escapes to Dublin, but he gets robbed. Left with no choice, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War. He decides to desert the army, and he eventually gets forced to join the Prussian Army where he becomes the protégé of Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He soon marries the Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) , but downfall is the near future as Barry's obsession with nobility will become the downfall of his family and fortune.As Stanley Kubrick is wont to do, he developed a cast that not many people may be familiar with. But because Kubrick always know what he is doing, the cast somehow works out well. The biggest name here is Ryan O'Neal and he is not even that much of a household name. He opened eyes with his role in The Love Story, so that is why people may recognize him. I thought he did a really good job. I was invested in his character throughout the entire film. His character could have worked as a completely serious character (and there are some very serious dramatic moments), but I love how he interjected some humor into his role. I also enjoyed Patrick Magee's performance. Magee is best known for his work in A Clockwork Orange as the writer who gets robbed, and I thought his performance here was a really enjoyable one.I love Kubrick's taste of music in his films. Of course everyone knows about the famous music he used in 2001: A Space Odyssey and to an extent in A Clockwork Orange. So we know he has a passion for classical music based on his previous work. So it should come to no surprise he uses composers like Bach and Mozart to enhance his movie. A very good score which makes this movie even the more enjoyable.Overall, Barry Lyndon is another fine piece of filmmaking from the legendary director Stanley Kubrick. It's a bit strange because upon release in 1975, the film actually didn't do too well critically and financially. People called it a disappointment because it was a completely different movie than expected and wondered why he would make a period piece that has plenty of English tax lingo and people cheating on each other. The movie may not have been a financial success, but the critical steam has built up over time and nowadays, people rank the movie as one of Kubrick's best. It is not the perfect masterpiece as his previous films, but its still an enjoyable costume drama that tends to be a little stuffy and overlong. However, it has an excellent first half of the film plus the movie makes good use of music, costumes, set design, and everything regarding the beautiful visuals.My Grade: A-",Barry Lyndon
81,Angry_Arguer,The Camera and the Stage,10,14 August 2003,"When I was in high school, it was considered ""cool"" to watch Stanley Kubrick movies as they were seen as ""more enlightened forms of entertainment"" over stuff by Steven Spielberg and John Hughes.  If you didn't memorize the opening speech to Full Metal Jacket or hadn't seen Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut then you were rejected from the clique.  This was at the time when I was first viewing Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ran and accidentally came across this gem.  Sure, the rest of the gang would be quoting along with Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, but not one of them would dare sit down and watch this or 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Fools.Barry Lyndon is another sign of sheer genius on behalf of Kubrick.  Notice that in his career he is never concerned about making money, just creating an image and telling a story.  Imagine if Michael Bay did the same, he'd be out of the business in no time and having to sell his own movies at the Video Hut.  This movie is one of his better detailed (and yet mysteriously unsung) masterpieces that is so beautiful to look at that it almost becomes artistic pornography (in the sense of creating intense emotion).  This isn't to say that Barry Lyndon is vulgar.  By comparison to Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining, this is a kid's cartoon.Kubrick is once again a certified genius with his camera.  The elaborate and glamorous scenes ranging from duels to gardens and even just the opening prologue are beautifully rendered in a style reminiscent of Monet or other artists.  I found it interesting how Kubrick includes pigeons (doves?) in the final duel.  Perhaps John Woo gained some inspiration from this.The story is paper thin compared to 2001 and lacks much of the symbolism. In fact, it is very hard to either sympathize with Ryan O'Neil as the title character because of his lack of portrayal.  As a whole, none of the characters gain either support or disapproval because of their fleeting presence.  The sets and costume designs themselves become more of a character than the actors.  Thankfully, the story is not as convoluted as I expected.  It flows nicely and never gets boring because of the variety of powerful elements infused into it.First off, kudos to both Ken Adam and Vernon Dixon for their brilliant production design.  I loved what Ken did with Dr. Strangelove (smart move for him to ditch the Bond series for that).  John Alcott is one of Kubrick's lesser cinematographers, but he is still very talented here.  I'm certain that, if he had lived longer, Kubrick would've kept using him.  He is not as concerned about symmetry, that or the topics aren't, as the rest of Kubrick's work.  The biggest irony about Barry Lyndon would have to be that everyone in the categories EXCEPT Kubrick won an Oscar for their work.  I think the Academy has something of a grudge against him because of his superior quality of work.Overall, a phenomenal quality of film that they just don't make anymore.  I put this in my Top 10 required viewings for anyone who wants to be in film. Kubrick has transcended Shakespeare with this film.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Barry Lyndon
82,Pedro_H,Restrained historical drama with incredible period detail.,7,5 May 2003,"A roguish young Irishman goes on a tour of Europe and - various military adventures down the line - falls in to a marriage of financial convenience.Three hours of screen time is long by anybody's standards, but at least you are viewing the incredible vision of Stanley Kubrick for that time. Whatever you might say about him, there are moments in all his films (even Clockwork Orange, which I detest) that are magical and moving.Here there is not a scene, prop or location that doesn't ring true to the period; although maybe a bit over-the-top picture postcard at times.
Many indoor scenes seem designed to make the world almost in to a moving painting, in fact there are times when we linger (for a few seconds) in stillness before dialogue/action starts to further the effect.Some say Ryan O'Neil was too modern for the central role, but I disagree, his acting is far from Oscar material but it gets us through the movie with minimal fuss. While BL is clearly not a man of honour, a lot of the time he is merely doing what he needs to do to get by and I found him hard to dislike - even through he is a child beater!Often he is given no real lines, but emotes on the tragedy and his traps with looks, anxious glances and glazed expressions. Female lead Marissa Berenson (although hardly in the picture on the old stopwatch) seems chosen for her dazzling profile - which we linger on slowly and lovingly, by order of films joint producer and director. We don't know her or understand her though - and that is the film's one major fault.BL is the kind of film that you are going to have to get yourself prepared for mentally and in terms of sitting comfort. There are real moments of mastery here (the duelling scenes - with the rules being explained slowly and clearly - are the work of someone who understands tension and timing perfectly), but while I salute it for its technical expertise and loving care, it does leave you with the feeling that you have spent three hours in an art gallery as opposed to watching a film.",Barry Lyndon
83,bryank-04844,Kubrick's vision for 'Barry Lyndon' is one of the most beautiful pieces of art and cinema out there.,10,12 August 2015,"After 'A Clockwork Orange' and before 'The Shining', Stanley Kubrick made an epic period drama that was 187 minutes long. It's the least talked about films of Kubrick's resume, but should in fact be one of the most discussed for its sheer beauty and brilliance. Kubrick decided to adapt the 1844 fictional book called 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon' by William Makepeace Thackeray and the results were astounding. Not only did Kubrick's vision win critic and audience's praises, but it also won four Oscars and might be Kubrick's best looking film in his collection of work, which is quite the feat, considering every single one of his films is visually stunning.Hell, many critics and outlets have deemed 'Barry Lyndon' one of the greatest films ever made, and they wouldn't be far off the mark with that statement. But why does this film get the shaft from debates and film geeks like ourselves, spending hours discussing. Maybe it's perhaps the slow burn of this very long film, instead of Kubrick giving us a wild and adventurous tale of one man. Or maybe it's the fact that our main protagonist, Barry isn't such a great man from start to finish, thus disconnecting us with someone to relate to, not mater the time period. But I think that is one of the points here.Kubrick not only wanted to make a film that was similar to walking into one of the greatest art galleries of the world and spending hours looking at the gorgeous paintings, but also show us an objective look at a man's life and how he conducted himself in his own selfish ways, which leads Kubrick to hypnotize us for a couple of hours before smacking us in the face. It's quite a brilliant move on Kubrick's part. Told in two acts, 'Barry Lyndon' starts out with Barry's father being killed in a duel in Ireland. At this time he known as Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neil). After the death of this father, Barry falls in love with his cousin and makes several advances towards her, although she never reciprocates, because she loves the English military Captain.This angers the bratty and rude Barry and with his idiotic reaction to this, he is forced to flee his home and with no money and nowhere to go, he enlists in the British Army where he is shipped into the Seven Years' War. You'd think Barry would mature or think things through, but he doesn't and flees his post and regimen and ends up forced to join the Prussian army now. After the war, Barry is still a jerk and to make money, ends up becoming a cheating gambler with wealthy players. If his opponents give him grief or don't pay, he duels. Not exactly the best life.He soon has an epiphany and no longer wants to live a poor life of gambling, cheating, and stealing, therefor he decides to marry a rich woman so that he can live off her dime. He accomplishes this with marrying a very wealthy countess (Marisa Berenson). It's not too long that the countess realizes what kind of person Barry really is, who has now taken on her last name Lyndon, hence 'Barry Lyndon'. Barry openly cheats, steals, and does not love his wife, but only uses her for her money where he lives a life of debauchery for his selfish needs. The only person who seems to want to speak up or do something about Barry is the countess' son from her first marriage.And now we see all these issues and harm that Barry has caused come full circle as it weighs him down and causes him great humiliation, and rightfully so. What he has tried so hard to do, which is to clim the social ladder and keep his pockets full of money, suddenly come crashing down with his stupidity and childish actions. And the second half of the film focuses on Barry trying to confront these problems. This is not a redeeming story by any means as Barry never wants to better himself, but would rather keep up his shameful shenanigans for his own personal glory and wealth, which is coming to a stop quickly.Kubrick's vision for 'Barry Lyndon' is one of the most beautiful pieces of art and cinema out there. Each frame of the film could be paused, printed out, and hung up on your wall. It's that amazing. The use of natural light and classical music fully immerses you into this old world, and with award winning performances by everyone in the film, it's no doubt that Kubrick has concocted yet another masterpiece for himself and for us to enjoy and talk about. It's one of those films, like most of Kubrick's movies where if it is on television, you can't help but watch the whole thing all the way through. It's a film where you'll notice something different each time and take away something new with each viewing, which is something that doesn't come along too often.",Barry Lyndon
84,EijnarAmadeus,Philosophical and absolutely awe-inspiring.,10,6 August 2008,"Stanley Kubrick's creative vision on 1975's Barry Lyndon is clearly out of the mind of a genius; the film looks and almost (note almost) acts like it was a painting, the camera is placed thoroughly as a long-shot in which the audience overlooks the events with just as much attention on the beautiful landscape in the background or the brilliant period detail put down to work here, as on the actual actions going on; and the actual actions is the rise and fall of Redmond Barry, three hours of ups and downs that spans itself over years and naturally acts like an epic biography. And the useful narrative voice-over keeps up with the story, because to me it seems as if Kubrick was just as much interested in telling the story with eyes for the gorgeous, idyllic and detailed, as he was to letting us under Barry Lyndon's skin - something we somehow really don't. No other than Kubrick could have done this with such a elegant pace or artistic self-awareness.And somehow these costume-dramas tend to put most of its ambition in its production design - but few really tend to succeed with combining this with an interesting storyline. Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette' was a fresh breath and new-take at this genre, but it flawed in its narration, especially towards the end - Barry Lyndon never flaws. It's slow but surprisingly entertaining rhythm seems to capture you right off the start, and the dazzlingly beautiful shots of both interior and exterior locations are Kubrick's most gorgeous. Barry Lyndon is like a moving painting - and feels like a three-hour gorgeous experience of a man whose principals in life is to have a continuous development and progression, and with this comes success and failure.",Barry Lyndon

A three hour epic that doesn't seem like your watching such a long film. Every scene endures in the memory. Be it contributions from the cast and/or the many filmmaking talents some of the best British cinema has produced.I am talking not only of Kubrick himself, but the likes of legendary set designer Ken Adam, who no doubt the more Bondian fans will fondly remember.
Each scene is quite literally like a classical painting it appears! In terms of locations used, lighting and camera angles used by Kubrick.
Even NASA lenses were used to elicit more light from candlelit interiors.Kubrick films are known for their legendary use of classical music (2002: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange spring to mind). Barry Lyndon has the same musical history.",Barry Lyndon

It's satirical and cynical, but will break your heart.It's one of the, if not the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.Its protagonist has one of the best character arcs ever in film.It has a very effective use of voice-over narration, but depends on the visual storytelling.The turning point could have been more convincing by focus a little more at some point earlier in the film on the flaw the character has that made him change, especially as the runtime of the movie is 3 hours. Nevertheless, there were a lot of incidents and affairs happened to Barry that could easily be considered as reasons that lead him to change.It's now my second favorite Kubrick film!

87,raymond-15,Brilliant and inspired cinema,8,2 August 2004,"Considered one of Thackeray's best novels ""Barry Lyndon"" comes to light in a brilliant fashion under the direction of Stanley Kubrik with Ryan O'Neal in the title role.A young Irish profligate of the 18th Century finds himself involved in the Seven Year's War in Europe. A born opportunist he deserts as a soldier and by all foul means seeks to improve his status by marrying a countess. He is now one of the new aristocracy...Mr. Barry Lyndon!The film version of Barry Lyndon's adventures as a cheat, as a spy, as a gentleman of the realm is absolutely flawless.  I have only high praise for the uniform quality as we go from scene to scene. The lighting in particular is striking, much like a classical painting. The photography is excellent....sweeping vistas of the European countryside with red-coated soldiers drawn up in battle lines and dropping in disarray under enemy fire....indoor scenes of elegance with people feasting or playing at cards, all bathed in soft candlelight Every scene is backed by well-chosen music gleaned from the classics. The choice is so good one might think it was written for the film. The art director too can be proud of the meticulous costumes, wigs and make-up; and the aging of the characters is well done and acceptable.There is also a lovely array of characters both old and young with interesting faces like those you would see in an old Rembrandt. As a character I especially like the old count who suffers terribly from an argument with the new Mr. Lyndon.  Another memorable scene is the outburst of the Countess's son who refuses to accept his step-father and endures a thorough thrashing.  There are poignant scenes too when Barry's little son comes to grief....and these are the days too when differences are solved by pistol or sword.All in all a well rounded film.  I find it much more satisfying than ""Russian Ark"" which is praised so highly.  This film is filled with beauty and adventure and proves once again that ""what goes up must come down""....and so we have the rise and fall of Barry Lyndon!",Barry Lyndon
88,TheOtherFool,I'm sure it's a great novelle...,6,10 March 2004,"... but as a film, 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't quite work. We follow the life of country boy Redmond Barry and his rise and fall in British aristocracy. This is done in such a fragmentaric way it's hard to name it one movie. At one part, Lyndon is a spy for the Prussian Minister of Police, but only for the mere reason to make him meet the Chevalier, and the movie has loads of such bits and parts which are small movies at itself, and hardly interesting or important enough to be concluded in the whole. Another thing I found irritating is the over-use of the voice-over. He just tells way too much. Now, 'film-technical' there's nothing wrong with Barry Lyndon, it's even a masterpiece in some ways (hence the 4 oscars, and the endless and deserved praise it gets for the fantastic usage of lenses to get that candlelight feeling on the big screen), but in the end the story is not interesting enough to catch your interest, at least not for 3 whole hours. My grade: 6/10.",Barry Lyndon
89,DarthVoorhees,An exuberant rush to the senses,10,5 July 2009,"Barry Lyndon isn't Stanley Kubrick's best film, far from it, but I may say that I got to know Stanley Kubrick as an artist the best from Barry Lyndon above any of his other films. It is a masterpiece of epic proportions. No other film in Kubrick's body of work looks as good as Barry Lyndon does. It is a magnificent sight for the eyes and the ears.Kubrick is famous to the mainstream and uneducated movie goer more so for the rumors of his eccentricities than his actual body of work. My personal favorite story of his over perfectionist view is that he would spend painstaking time on a shot just to make sure every conceivable sharp pin point detail was perfect. Of course there is probably little actual truth to this rumor but with Lyndon you might actually believe it. It is a gorgeous picture to look at. Kubrick brought us to space, hell, and the jungles of Vietnam but Barry Lyndon is by far the most amazing setting he ever dealt with. It's not merely a period picture, calling it this wouldn't be doing it justice. Stanley Kubrick has created the most authentic feeling historic film of all time despite having the story being lavish and times very over the top. It's easy for a director to simply show a shot of a castle or a reenactment of an eighteenth century battle. Kubrick doesn't do this, the vocal point of every scene brings us into the life of Redmond Barry and how his life is intertwined with the times. The period piece can only work if we feel that we belong in this period. And we belong, the candle light scenes prove it, Like 'A Clockwork Orange' music gives this film it's pulse. Leonard Rosenman's score is by far Kubrick's best soundtrack. I can't imagine Barry Lyndon having the same effect with a different score. Not only does the score feel authentic with pieces by the brilliant Bach and Handel but it gives the film so much more life than a lot of soundtracks do. A good soundtrack will make a picture better, but in Barry Lyndon's case the soundtrack is a living part of the picture that it manifests it's own character.What really amazes me about Barry Lyndon is that it is by far one of the weakest stories Kubrick ever adapted. All though well respected in his time Thackerby is usually only remembered for Vanity Fair. The original novel is all most all but forgotten except for being the basis for Kubrick's film. Lyndon isn't all that intriguing of a character, his motives are clear cut,become a rich Lord by all means necessary. For the most part the character is not all that likable and yet Kubrick and to a lesser degree Ryan O'Neil make this character dimensional and intriguing. We are asked by Kubrick in several scenes to look at him and judge his worthiness. Redmond Barry wants to succeed in life and for a lost Irishmen in exile he goes the way of the trickster. Would he have gained any sense of credibility had he not sought Lady Lyndon's hand in marriage? An Irishman seeking to be noble is not looked kindly upon in this society. I can't think of a better way to end the picture than what Kubrick did. The climatic duel is by far one of Kubrick's strongest scenes, which truly does offer strong sympathy to Barry. We never know what becomes of him, ashamed and ruined of any sense of dignity we ask ""Did he really deserve this fate?"" One improvement I notice is that Kubrick does not have O'Neal himself narrate the story. He doesn't want the audience to be distracted by Barry's own account and to be swayed in one direction or another. Lady Lyndon's last scene as she signs the check for Barry's yearly sum is a brilliant shot and it engages the viewer. Does she still love him? Kubrick knew how to make you think and choose the complexities in any story he was adapting.",Barry Lyndon
90,Christian_Dimartino,A lost Stanley Kuberick masterpiece.,10,18 July 2011,"Stanley Kuberick's Barry Lyndon is one of his many masterpieces. Its not like any film that he's ever done. Never before has he gone so in-depth with character. Redmond Barry,like some of Kuberick's other heroes, is an unlikably likable character.The film chronicles the life of Redmond Barry(Ryan O'Neill), a young Irishman whose life changes after he falls in love with his cousin, duels her fiancé out of jealousy, and kills him, or, thats what he thinks, and goes on the run.Redmond becomes a British soldier, than an Irish soldier, than a spy, and after a while his success grows and grows until he meets the wife of a duke, and marries her. And things change for him there too. His stepson loathes him, and he gains respect from everyone else, and becomes Barry Lyndon.Watching Barry Lyndon, I wasn't sure what direction this film was going in. And I suppose that never a bad thing. Here, its a strength. Though Barry Lyndon is 3 hours long, you can't help but wonder whats going to happen next. And the last half hour is especially thrilling.O'Neill's performance here is very underrated. Though this isn't exactly a film that people look back on, I have never heard many people rave about his performance. O'Neill gets under your skin at times, but yet you still root for him, even though he is a terrible person.Despite its length, Barry Lyndon is a strong and gripping film, especially in the climax. In the climax, anything goes. And anything went. Barry Lyndon is a lost hit, and I hope that somebody will dig it up again someday.A",Barry Lyndon
91,Marwan-Bob,Pure ART.,9,9 February 2017,"Barry Lyndon is a prime example of Kubrick stepping back from standard Kubrick and making something that baffles audiences. Much like Eyes Wide Shut , which opened in the nineties and was met with disappointment, this film, which was released in the 70s, often deviates from the director's standard directorial signatures.There is a loud and frequently remarkable score to go along with many of the scenes (and it really is a great score) and the running time, at just over three hours, is enough for someone to realize who is calling the shots in the editing room, but it feels more like a Spielbergian period piece than a Stanley Kubrick movie.It feels like an adventure, with our lead character constantly going through changes and frequently finding himself in new situations that call for different settings and when those settings change, we know we're in for another half-hour or so of fun (and sometimes intense) action.I loved it.",Barry Lyndon
92,anselmdaniel,A grand period adventure,9,31 August 2019,"This review contains spoilers.Barry Lyndon is a period drama film that premiered in 1975. The movie's direction, production, and the screenplay is by Stanley Kubrick. The story is based on The Luck of Barry Lyndon by William Makepeace Thackeray. The movie stars Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson. The movie centers around the life of Barry Lyndon. The movie tells the tale of Redmond Barry's early life culminating in his marriage to the Countess of Lyndon. The movie is a sprawling 187 minute running time epic.Barry Lyndon is an excellent movie. This movie is magnificently directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The best attribute of the movie is that it is incredibly beautiful. The movie uses natural lighting in its shots. There is a staggering number of shots that are utterly gorgeous to look at. This movie bases its shots on old 18th century paintings and it absolutely shows in the movie. The movie's production quality is incredibly high with props, and dresses being of immaculate quality. It made for the movie being one of the best produced movies in the 1970s.The story in this movie tells a grand tale across the 18th century. The movie mainly takes the perspective of Redmond Barry as he transitions from Redmond Barry to Barry Lyndon. The movie focuses on the scoundrel of Barry as he seeks to elevate his social standing. Although the audience may not always agree with Barry, the scoundrel has enough charisma to make the adventure enjoyable. It made the adventure into an exciting morally gray zone. The movie has two main acts in Barry's rise and eventually his fall.Both of the acts are incredibly fun to watch. The first act is more centered on Redmond Barry's rise. He has many misadventures that are incredibly fun to watch. Redmond Barry goes on a massive adventure across Europe as he fights in the Seven Years War. Eventually he encounters the Chevalier. This entire event makes a massive difference in Redmond Barry's life as he is able to change from a scoundrel gambler into someone poised to elevate his standing in society.The second act is not as action packed as the first act. It centers around Barry's rise in nobility and eventual downturn. It makes for an exciting story as the second act has Barry at his worst that eventually destroys Barry's reputation. There are glimmers of Barry's roguish charm and his innocent nature that show in this second act. It made for an interesting act as the audience needs to grapple with whether they should sympathize with Barry or if he is deserving of his fate.Barry Lyndon is a character and period driven movie that can be incredibly moving at times. It is however a slow movie that requires setup in order to drive its effectiveness for the viewer. This can make the movie seem too slow but I believe that the payoff is worth it. The movie has gorgeous visuals that can enrapture the audience. Barry Lyndon is a one-of-a-kind movie that is not often produced by large studios.I highly recommend 'Barry Lyndon'. This is a solid movie that demands patience from the audience.Grade: A",Barry Lyndon
93,virek213,Kubrick In The Late 18th Century,9,15 July 2014,"Stanley Kubrick was one of those directors who made the kinds of films that were so easily misunderstood and misread upon first viewing. From his first film, 1953's FEAR AND DESIRE, up to the 1960 epic SPARTACUS (which he really only had a modicum of control on, and which he basically dismissed), he stayed within traditional filmmaking bounds. But after LOLITA in 1962, he set out to push those filmmaking bounds out of the way; and from that point on, until his last one, 1999's EYES WIDE SHUT, he was a hero to a great many aspiring filmmakers, and a complete enigma to film critics. Most important of all, he never made the same kind of movie twice, which made him perhaps the most utterly unpredictable director of the post-war cinema. His 1975 costume epic BARRY LYNDON is a case in point.In choosing to do a lavish adaptation of the then-little-known book ""The Luck Of Barry Lyndon"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, Kubrick invested his trademark sense of deep, dark irony in depicting an Irish rogue (Ryan O'Neal), who, after winning a duel, goes out in the world to find his fortune. After a series of adventures and misadventures alike, including a stint in Her Majesty's Army, he seems to find the fortune in the guise of Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), but he quickly runs afoul of his newlywed wife's stubborn stepson Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali). It all comes down to a duel between him and Vitali in the barn of the Lyndon estateand there can only be ONE winner.Among the many ways that Kubrick defied audience expectations, this film is one that doesn't movie especially fast. At three hours and four minutes, it's no MTV video; but pretty much after the stately interstellar mood of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, it would be part-and-parcel of this director not only not to give what the audience expects, but to give them something that requires total concentration. Primarily filmed in England and Ireland over a period of twelve to eighteen months at the mid-point of the 1970s, BARRY LYNDON was a fairly expensive movie, at a cost of $11 million, and was, at the time, perhaps Kubrick's most poorly received film; widely mixed critical and audience reactions in America and England resulted in only modest box office returns there, though the film did clean up in Europe.O'Neal has come in for a fair working-over for his portrayal of Barry Lyndon over the last four decades, but I think it is a very good performance, molded as it were under a thorough taskmaster like Kubrick; and the same could be said for Berenson as Lady Lyndon. BARRY LYNDON also features some excellent turns by such British character actors as Patrick Magee, Phillip Stone, Hardy Krueger, Steven Berkoff, Leonard Rossiter, Godfrey Quigley, George Sewell, and Anthony Sharp.The film justifiably won four Oscars: cinematography (John Alcott); costume design (Milena Canonero); production design (Ken Adam, who worked with Kubrick on DR. STRANGELOVE, and Roy Walker); and musical adaptation (primarily of works by Mozart, Paisiello, Schubert, and Handel) by veteran composer Leonard Rosenman (whose credits included GIANT; FANTASTIC VOYAGE; BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APRES; and A MAN CALLED HORSE). Particularly notable in the latter is Rosenman's bold orchestration of the Sarabande from Handel's Keyboard Suite #11, which has since become BARRY LYNDON's musical calling card, much as Richard Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" had been for ""2001."" And in terms of the photography, Alcott and camera expert Ed Di Giulio did a great thing by giving Kubrick the idea to use very powerful lenses to shoot a number of complex scenes lit only by candlelight, which has been tried by many a period film that followed in the wake of this movie.A great deal of patience is required for BARRY LYNDON; and, as with many a Kubrick film, this one requires many viewings to really understand the various nuances and themes. But a lot of times this is what great films demand, and BARRY LYNDON is an excellent demonstration of such.",Barry Lyndon
94,the red duchess,"A film worthy of the superlative superlatives - Kubrick's masterpiece, best film of the 1970s, one of the 20 best of all time...Etc. Etc. (spoilers)",10,17 August 2001,"Like the sustained cinematic fugue it is, 'Barry Lyndon''s opening scenes provide a theme that will be treated to increasingly virtuosic variations throughout.  Barry's father is killed in a duel.  Barry lives with his mother who refuses to remarry.  Barry loses his virginity to a woman playing a role while playing cards.  These are the great threads - Fathers, Duels, Mother, Sex, Women, The Unattainable, Masks, Games, Gambling - weaving into the web that will eventually trap Barry Lyndon, Fate like a spider picking him off sadistically limb by limb.'Barry' is structured around duels - the film begins and climaxes with one; key plot points centre around duels and 'organised' brawls.  These duels are not just of the fencing/shooting type - they can be a stand-off in gambling; the deceptive games men and women play; the punishment meted out by fathers on stepsons, elder brothers on young half-brothers; a summons to redundancy; the phlegmatic defiance of a crippled cuckold; the attempt to hoodwink an officer.  it doesn't even have to be negative - Barry's introduction to the chevalier begins with tacit antagonism, ends in a moving and genuine friendship.  these duels are tests Barry must pass, traps he must avoid in his forward movement towards status and wealth.But this duality has more thematic resonance than that, signified in the name-change form Redmond Barry to Barry Lyndon.  It is a conflict between the individual and society, between that individual's genuine self, if there is such a thing, and the masks he adopts to hide any defects that self might have.  The moral significance of the duels change as Barry moves from being a passionate lover to a ruthless schemer.  For all Thackeray's ironic wit, there is a moralising streak in his novel, not necessarily of the 'Don't rise above your station' variety, but suggesting the unhappiness waiting for anyone who will forsake their true character for glittering, but fake baubles.Kubrick takes this material and makes it his own, framing another story about a criminal outsider and a rigid, immovable social structure far more powerful than its individual constituents.  Masks for Barry aren't necessarily a fragmentation of his identity, a degeneracy of his values. They are his way of beating the system, of infiltrating the fortress and destroying it from within.  Far from becoming a monster, Barry is deliberately shown as both a debauchee and a loving father (the theme of fathers, from Barry's dead one, to his two benevolent father-figures; his replacing Bullingdon's father and his relationship with his own son, contrasted with the figures of mothers, is a powerful theme throughout)
It is a cliche that Kubrick is a bleak misanthrope and 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't suggest otherwise, with its farcically horrifying vision of war, and the more lethal machinations of society.  The film deliberately sets in conflict (another duel) two 'times', a historical time of war and Great Powers, linked to Barry's journey from fugitive to aristocrat, and a circular time, in which events simply repeat themselves, and nothing ever changes.  This is the Age of Enlightenment, where 'progress' was the soundbite, the idea that the sum of human knowledge and hence the sum of human happiness could be improved.kubrick, bleakly, counters this - visualised in a film of staggering beauty, a successful attempt to fuse all the progressive art forms of the of the era (painting, theatre, sculpture, architecture, landscape gardening, music etc.) into a blinding whole - with scenes, especially the climactic duel with Bullingdon, suggestive of regression, primitivism, a reversion to tribalism (which, in effect, is what happens, a social order regrouping and expelling the outsider).  The Church is now a henyard covered in straw, dark stage for a primitive rite, one that has been repeated throughout the film, denying all progress.  the ritual, tribal drums make this overpoweringly apparent.Barry ends up back where he began: worse, with the loss of a leg.  Decades on, nothing has changed for Lady Lyndon either, signing cheques for her new 'husband', her son.  The last date we see is 1789, that famous date of Revolution in France, spiralling out everywhere else, but not here, and Kubrick implies, not really anywhere.  the old cliche, 'Plus ca change...'Call me sentimental (or Irish) though, but in that final duel, when Barry refuses to kill his enemy, the light shining behind him through the narrow slits, the white doves flapping around him, suggest a religious interpretation, a suggestion that Barry may lose the world, but is somehow saved, redeemed: condemned to repetitious purgatory on earth, but beyond, who knows?  Because this is Kubrick's second duality, his own, a miraculous balancing act between a film of pure abstraction, and a moving, funny, horrifying character study.  Throughout Barry is made ridiculous, the dupe, the victim, and yet always retains our sympathy (largely through that heartbreakingly pained face) making even us atheists desire some salvation for him.The film's greatest scene - the gambling table, where Barry and Lady Lyndon stare at each other in the candlelight like clockwork figures forced into humanity, is a masterpiece of cinema translating minimalist acting into genius - Ryan O'Neal in this film gives one of the great performances thanks to Kubrick, worth a thousand of yer celebrated hams.",Barry Lyndon
95,Bolesroor,Hot Garbage,1,22 February 2011,"I love Stanley Kubrick. ""2001"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" are two of my all-time favorite films. I also love ""Clockwork Orange,"" ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and ""Paths Of Glory."" So you can see why I was shocked and disappointed when I finally got around to seeing the stultifying ""Barry Lyndon,"" a film so dull and pointless that you'll wonder why he bothered.I'll start with the one positive: the cinematography. The movie is beautifully photographed... every frame is rich, lush, and looks like the box cover of a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. That might be enough to salvage a film if the story was told visually, but ""Barry Lyndon"" is a movie with little or no narrative. Ryan O'Neal- passive and blank- floats through the picture like Forrest Gump or Benjamin Button: the lights are on but nobody's home. We get no sense of any inner life or personality, and the small amount of character we do glimpse reveals Barry to be a spoiled, selfish coward, and one hardly worthy of such a massively-scaled motion picture.The story follows Barry as he falls in love with his cousin, deserts the Army, lies about his bravery, marries a wealthy widow, cheats on her while squandering her fortune and abuses his stepson. He is an awful, unpleasant person, and Kubrick never seems to figure out WHY we're following the man's life in the first place. Glaring gaps in the plot are filled in by a narrator, who advances the story more in three lines than we get in half an hour of wordless drudgery.Yes, the candlelight scenes are beautiful. Use of the special NASA lens was obviously part of Kubrick's reward for filming the faked moon landings, but this is not a device on which an entire film can rest. It astounds me that there are so few people willing to stand up and say the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. It seems to me that most people declare this movie profound because they feel they're supposed to, because if something looks and sounds like a classic, a masterpiece, then it surely must be... right? Wrong. ""Barry Lyndon"" is a dull, plodding, pretentious period piece without any saving graces. Composition of frame and brilliant lighting do not make up for a poor actor playing an unengaging character in a movie that does its best to kill any sense of drama, suspense, humor, and action. This feels almost like a deliberate statement by the great Kubrick to make a movie WITHOUT significance... this is an empty exercise in period photography, and little else. ""None of the grandeur of ""2001,"" he seems to say, ""none of the shocking violence of ""Clockwork Orange..."" Just three solid hours of powdered wigs and blank faces. Any reviewer who says otherwise is a pseudo-intellectual pandering to the ghost of a legend. Don't waste your time.GRADE: D-",Barry Lyndon

98,WriterDave,Beyond Superb,10,28 December 2004,"Two films from this past year prompted me to revisit Kubrick's ultimate costume drama, ""Barry Lyndon,"" both of them staring the opulent Nicole Kidman--Von Trier's ""Dogville"" for its languid pacing and literary narration, and the much maligned ""Birth"" for its classical music score and long, wide camera shots. What I discovered while watching for the first time uninterrupted the digitally remastered DVD of Kubrick's period piece is that the film was paradoxically way ahead of its time while at the same time over-indulgently a time warp of a film that much like a great sci-fi flick, took the viewer completely into another world, this one just happened to be late 18th century Britian and Europe.Kubrick's attention to visual and sound detail (the music, the sounds of birds and trees rustling, the cold echos of a Lord's castle) is mind boggling. All the outdoor shots were filmed in the pure natural light of day, while all the interior shots were done by candle-light. The result is amazing. His attention to character, as usual is austere (only in the death scene of Barry's young son does the viewer feel any sympathy), but fittingly so given the grotesque formalities that surrounded everyday life in the era in which these characters lived and died. The themes are epic (duels, dastardly deeds by state and individual, wars at home and abroad, betrayal, greed, lust) as is the scope of the camera's eye. The visual sumptuousness of the entire endeavor almost pummels the viewer into submission and left me in an altered state almost as wondrous and weird as the one Kubrick created in ""2001"" where I actually felt like I was part of this strange world of 18th century Britian. For the film buff, this is a work of art, and for fans of period pieces this is the pinnacle of the genre.",Barry Lyndon
99,Jithindurden,Not Kubrick's best but still a great attempt,9,7 December 2017,"Essentially a story of a villain, the film manages to make the viewers care about every character and hate them at the same time. The character arc of Redmond Barry is shown in a singular way that which only Kubrick could've done. The character arc of Redmond Barry is shown in a singular way that which only Kubrick could've done.

100,asda-man,Like watching a very old oil painting dry... But somehow it remains engrossing!,8,30 April 2015,"There is nothing about Barry Lyndon which is appealing to me. Everything is against it, and if it didn't have Stanley's name attached to it then I probably would never give it the time of day. It's basically a three hour period drama which moves at a snail's pace and is full of dull, stiff and unlikable characters. So, why did I like it? Why did I not find it tedious and boring? These are questions I'm still asking myself and it appears to be the hypnotic nature of Stanley's films. 2001: A Space Odyssey is painfully slow and has no memorable characters (except HAL) yet it's one of the best films I've ever seen.Let's start with its beauty. Even the haters can't deny the sheer gorgeousness of pretty much every shot. The film opens to a haunting classical score and throws up a landscape shot which could easily be mistaken for an oil painting. Every landscape/exterior shot had my jaw on the floor at the sheer beauty of it, and I'm not one to get all excited over scenery. I don't like to use the word 'perfect' because things rarely are, however that's exactly the word I'd use to describe some of the shots. Just perfect. The costumes and sets are wonderfully lavish too and do a great job of plunging you into the life and atmosphere of those times.Even though the film is a whopping 180 minutes there wasn't one moment when I was bored. Perhaps some parts dragged on for a little too long in the war half, but I was never fed up and the film didn't feel like it was three hours long. Not a lot happens but it somehow remains engrossing. It moves at its own pace and it seems to work well at creating an atmosphere that evokes its period.It's a very cold film and all the characters seem distant. Even the title character doesn't give much away, and lady Lyndon must say about four lines throughout the entire film! Something about it remains captivating though and not all of it is devoid of emotion. In fact, the scenes involving Lyndon and his son were very moving and quite powerful. It was also interesting how the film was told in two parts and both involving battlefields of one kind or another.Unfortunately, Ryan O Neal's performance is a little lacklustre. His Irish accent was all over the place and he didn't entirely convince in the role. The rest of the film however is quite exquisite. It's easy to see why people don't like it, because even I'm not quite sure what I found so appealing about it all. It is a technical master class though, and whilst it may be a step down from 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange it is still a great film in its own right. Stanley returned to breaking the mould with his next film though, which could very well be my favourite from his filmography.",Barry Lyndon
101,MichaelMargetis,"""I'm not sorry. And I'll not apologize. And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell. "" - Redmond Barry",8,14 July 2005,"'Barry Lyndon' is one of Stanley Kubrick's non-talked about films. That's not a big surprise in the slightest because 'Barry Lyndon' doesn't really break ground or re-invent the wheel really like Kubrick's other efforts like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Dr. Strangelove' or '2001: A Space Odyssey'. That isn't to say it's a bad movie, it's actually a great film! 'Barry Lyndon' might just be one of the best period pieces of all time, and since the legendary genius Stanley Kubrick was behind it, does it really surprise you? It's lavish and extravagant beauty will impress you even if the story gets a tiny bit dull at points. Kubrick achieves making another great movie with his beautiful and uncompromising portrait of the British Seven Years War era, 'Barry Lyndon', based on William Makepeace Thackeray's beloved novel.'Barry Lyndon' is the story of a bright young Irish lad named Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal). He's a sly, slick and smooth conman who screws and kills his way to the top. When he leaves his home in Ireland after dueling with his cousin and love interest's (Marie Kean) fiancé, Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), he gets robbed by a famous highwayman, Captain Feeny (Arthur O'Sullivan) and is forced to join the British army for money. During a y battle, Redmond, the common opportunist, deserts his army after the of his dear friend Captatin Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), steals a Lieutenant's horse, and takes his identity. Just when Redmond thinks he is safe, he is caught by a Prussian Captain (Hardy Kruger) and forced to join the Prussian army as a private. Redmond later saves a Prussian general and gets promoted to Corporal. He then is ordered by Lord Ludd (Steven Berkoff) to spy on a sneaky French Chevalier (Patrick Magee) and tell the Lord the Chevalier's secrets and plans. Redmond has other ideas, and decides to side with the Chevalier but pretend to still be working for Ludd and give him useless information. The Chevalier takes Redmond under his wing, teaching him everything including how to cheat in gambling. During Redmond's adventures with the Chevalier he meets the captivating and beautiful Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) who's married to the rich and powerful Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon (Frank Middlemass). The greedy Redmond decides to take full advantage of the opportunity of Sir Lyndon and marrying his wife for money. Barry succeeds, and the story from there captures Sir Redmond Barry Lyndon's downfall. The film also stars Gay Hamilton, Philip Stone, Murray Melvin, Andre Morell and Leon Vitali as Lady Lyndon's vengeful but weak son.Stanley Kubrick does a fantastic job with William Makepeace Thackeray's legendary tale of the sly Irish rogue, Barry Lyndon, who is ultimately consumed by his own greed. Kubrick's sense of direction in this is nothing short of breathtaking, his use of vibrant and alluring colors always keep 'Barry Lyndon' interesting when the story sometimes lags during it's three hour and four minute runtime. Kubrick's script is superb as to be expected from any of his motion pictures, and I can't imagine any writer that could have done a better job adapting Thackeray's novel to the film medium. In 'Barry Lyndon', the acting is one of the finest qualities. Ryan O'Neal gives his finest performance ever as the sneaky fortune-hunter. O'Neal really makes you understand the logic of Redmond Barry Lyndon, and why he does what he does. The supporting cast highlights are Patrick Magee, Godfrey Quigley, Murray Melvin, Arthur O'Sullivan, Leonard Rossiter, Gay Hamilton, Frank Middlemass and Leon Vitali who plays his role of the tragic and clumsy sissy to utter perfection. Marisa Berenson is very so-so in a particularly bland part, but besides her everyone else does an acceptable job. The costumes, set, makeup, cinematography and music score of 'Barry Lyndon' are without a doubt incredible, but like I made reference to before, the story drags towards the middle. You really have to be dedicated to watching 'Barry Lyndon' because if you're not you may just fall asleep during the plot slouches. Otherwise, 'Barry Lyndon' is near-brilliant.I recommend 'Barry Lyndon' to period piece fans and Kubrick fans who have not yet seen it already. Grade: B+MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #247",Barry Lyndon

103,baileycrawly,Carefully Crafted Masterpiece,10,5 December 2020,"Barry Lyndon is a special film. Stanley Kubrick has carefully and lovingly crafted a brilliant tale, utilizing the brilliant technique of featuring almost exclusively natural lighting for authenticity. Through his ingenious story-telling abilities, Kubrick has crafted a film that just passes over the 3 hour runtime, but never once drags or drones. Every second of screen time matters and is accounted for. The character-building is second to none, giving the audience a cast of characters they can easily care about and find a connection with, which makes the more emotional moments resonate so much more deeply. The costuming on this film is top notch, the cinematography is gorgeous (this may very well be the most beautiful Kubrick film to look at, and that's including his magnum opus, 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's crafted to Kubrickian proportions, with a fantastic score to compliment the visuals, some incredible action scenes and some of the tensest drama that I've seen on screen in a while.
To promote the digital version of this film, Warner Bros. proudly declares that this is ""One of the most beautiful films ever made,"" and it's easy to dismiss such claims as being (obviously) hastily written pleasantries designed to sell more copies of the film, but there's some serious merit behind the claim they make about this film. It's not common for me to invest so heavily in such a long film, but Kubrick grabbed me in and didn't let me go, and from start to finish every single note in this film hit exactly the way Kubrick intended it to. Another masterpiece from the master, and without question my favorite of the Kubrick films I've seen (which is about half).",Barry Lyndon

106,SkullScreamerReturns,Lesser known Kubrick but worth seeing,7,21 February 2020,"Everybody knows about The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, and Full Metal Jacket - even if they haven't actually seen the movies. But I've never heard ANYONE talk about Barry Lyndon. I found out about the existence of the movie by browsing Kubrick's filmography on IMDB.It's not that Barry Lyndon is bad. It's a spectacle that could as well be the most well known film of a director. But Kubrick's other films are even more famous, so they overshadow how good this one is too.I like how Kubrick made different type of films and always tried to make a masterpiece of that specific style. Barry Lyndon is a historical epic that has visual appeal, interesting characters, and a story of a long and winding journey. It's easy to see that the film is based on a book, even though I haven't read it. It has a very literary style. By that I mean the overall pacing and length of the story, and also the dialogue has poetic tendencies. If you like long books that follow the adventures of the main character throughout different places and times, you'll probably love this film.It's a little bit lengthy movie for my tastes but that's all right for this kind of film. I had a long and boring evening to spend with nothing else in mind so the movie had a fair chance to win my respect and it kind of did. I'm not going to watch it again very soon but it left some kind of lasting impression. I'll probably watch it again at some point and then possibly rate even higher.",Barry Lyndon
107,avik-basu1889,Ambition goes up against Determinism !!!,9,22 July 2017,"'Barry Lyndon' has a connection with '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Just like each character in 2001(who represent their species), Barry is shown to be someone who is willing to do anything to survive and prosper. His instincts generally revolve around his selfish desires of survival. In 2001 the desperate measures to survive at all cost end up being insignificant and inconsequential because of the implied presence of a higher power represented by the monoliths. This presence of a higher power is possibly meant to imply the concept of determinism and subversion of the idea of free will. In 'Barry Lyndon', Barry's father was killed in a duel right at the beginning of the film and Kubrick adds no feeling to that scene whatsoever. Clearly losing his father at a very young age had to have determined the life that Barry was going to lead. Having seen his life get shaped for him at a very young age without him having any influence, everything Barry does subsequently in his life in nothing but to achieve success, wealth and prosperity by asserting his own will instead of having to march to the beat of fate's tune. It is remarkable how similar Barry's sensibilities are to Charles Foster Kane's in 'Citizen Kane'. Kane was another man whose future was decided by someone else at a very young age and everything that Kane did subsequently in his life was to ensure that his life never revolved around anyone else's whims.The constant zoom-outs in the film are deliberate and thematically relevant. In Act 1, we see Barry embark on adventures, visits various places, fights in duels and wars,etc. and does everything else to ensure he looks out for himself and also to ensure he achieves material gains and an elevation in social status which he gets by marrying into wealth and class. He achieves temporary success through the sheer power of his will. This is why I think the zoom-outs in Act 1 are supposed to be premonitory. All of Barry's assertive actions are undermined by Kubrick's camera. Kubrick constantly zooms out to expand the visual field which makes Barry and the other characters look very small in the respective frames. But making Barry look miniscule in the shots, Kubrick is visually driving home the philosophical notion that no matter how hard Barry tries to willfully determine his future, in the end his actions won't matter in the bigger picture. What fate holds for him in the future will materialise whether he likes it or not. This is how Kubrick brings in determinism in the story. In Act 2, the zoom- outs are meant to show the characters completely frozen in time like the classic-era pictures on the walls.There is a scene where Barry views a picture on the wall and decides to buy it. There is a scene that comes up later which is significant because the framing is very similar to the aforementioned scene but the important thing is, this time Barry takes the place of the picture and King George III is checking him out. Barry as a person holds as little a significance as the characters in the painting.Although in Act 1 a number of the shots look like paintings too, but it is in Act 2 that the painting motif gets its thematic poignancy. This is because the majority of Act 2 takes place inside the palace walls and the actual pictures on the wall are constantly in view. The actual pictures on the wall themselves allow Kubrick to draw the comparison between them and his picture-like frame compositions. The purpose of the characters in the pictures on the wall is defined not by them, but by the person who drew them. Similarly the purpose of Barry's life and where it goes and how it crystallizes won't be determined by Barry, but by something/someone else, maybe God, maybe some other higher power, or mere chance(from a nihilistic standpoint) or maybe the society itself that Barry is a part of. Even though, he became Barry Lyndon, a lot of people in his surroundings never saw him as anything other than Barry Redmond. In the end all his achievements went in vain. The masterful thing is that the last time we see Barry in the film, he has his back to the camera. But the significant thing is, instead of zoom-outs, we get a zoom- in. Hence at this moment, instead of expanding the visual field, Kubrick contracts it to convey that Barry's ambition has been put in its place by fate.The cinematography of the film as has been mentioned time and again is jaw-dropping and coupled with the meticulous production design, 'Barry Lyndon' ends up being one of the most authentic, convincing and fully developed recreations of a period setting in the history of motion pictures.Although Kubrick again sets an emotionally distant tone, just like his other films, however the Act 2 of 'Barry Lyndon' contains some of the most emotionally charged scenes, moments and shots of Kubrick's entire career. Losing his father at a very early age, one aspect of Barry's life involved moving from one father figure to another. But when he himself becomes a father, he tries his level best to have the most loving relationship with his son and Kubrick actually upholds the purity of this father-son relationship by treating it with humanism without judgement.I have heard that 'Barry Lyndon' is Martin Scorsese's favourite Kubrick film. I find that interesting because on examination one can find that 'Barry Lyndon' and 'Goodfellas' feature an exceptionally similar arc of 'rags to riches to rags' revolving around two immensely ambitious men with the drive to break the class restrictions and rise to the top with the sheer power of their will and persistence. However, fate in the end reigns supreme and makes all their achievements and adventures seem pointless. Determinism plays a joke on them.",Barry Lyndon

109,rooee,They are all equal now,9,14 August 2016,"William Makepeace Thackeray's most famous novel, Vanity Fair, has been adapted into several films and TV series. The Luck of Barry Lyndon, later retitled The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq., hasn't been quite so regurgitated. Originally serialised in the 1840s before becoming a single volume in 1856 (although set in the previous century) it's a rambling text, described by a disinterested narrator, full of satirical swipes at the seventeenth century romantic ideal. Stanley Kubrick's adaptation – a bit of a flop in 1975 – dials down the satire. With Dr Strangelove, Kubrick had taken a cold and sober story (Red Alert) and turned it into a nightmare satirical comedy. With Lyndon he takes a rambunctious and ironic picaresque and turns it into a witty but ultimately sorrowful journey into the black heart of a world that can't accept the orphan foreigner.We begin in Ireland, where a young Redmond Barry (a blank slate Ryan O'Neal), in trying to win the heart of his cousin, challenges the smug Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) to a duel. The event triggers Redmond's exile, and he hits the road, not so much gallivanting around Europe as finding himself stumbling in and out of army units and from one bereft wife's bed to the next. Redmond has ambitions to wealth and status. So, when he comes into contact with Lady Lyndon (an even blanker slate Marisa Berenson), he decides to settle down and take advantage of her money and make himself a gentleman. Lyndon, however, is guarded by her fiercely protective son, Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali), who will defend her honour until the violent end. Barry Lyndon employs a realist aesthetic, but it's a beautified and exaggerated realism, like a photo album telling half the story – the pretty bits – as if we were observing the fantasy of an ordered universe. The style is perfect for the self-aggrandising nature of Redmond, who would rather keep himself unknowable in detail, but would gleefully embellish his grander legend. Kubrick predominantly makes use of zooms, as opposed to tracking shots, evoking a sense of flatness similar to a painting. The compositions themselves are reminiscent of 17th and 18th century pieces – at one point Lord Bullingdon effectively walks through Hogarth's ""The Morning After"". When the camera does come off the tripod – for example, during an astonishing brawl at a concert performance – the effect is brilliantly jarring. For a film that keeps its title character in frame but at arm's length for virtually its entire 180-minute running time (save for a brief interlude of contented fatherhood), Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's most moving and heartfelt film. Kubrick used cinema for awe (2001: A Space Odyssey) and anarchy (A Clockwork Orange); but he knew also that cinema is sadness: twenty-four transient events slipping away every second. The sombre rhythm of Barry Lyndon, and the lifetime it covers, is such that we are vitally aware of the passing of time. It is an exercise in anti-tension, with minimal editing and zero revelation. Michael Hordern's ironic narrator frequently informs us of important events before they occur.Kubrick was a proponent of the Soviet Montage school of editing: creating meaning through the juxtaposition of images. And yet with Barry Lyndon the meaning is created more by the events within the frame: the stillness, smallness and slowness of people in vast, beautiful, indifferent spaces. Barry Lyndon may lack the broad humour of the more accessible Dr Strangelove, but Kubrick's acknowledgement of the absurd is still present. Marriage, monogamy, material consumption, and the endless pursuit of money: the sometimes conflicted aspects of the independence-seeking society that sprung from the one we're watching on screen. It's a reflection of our world, today. Yes, Barry Lyndon is a historical film, and it's about history, but it's also about who we are now. It is a film that questions our values and our social convictions. We may laugh or cry at the picaresque rogue and the rigid class divisions he crosses. We may sneer at the loveless marriage born of loneliness at the story's centre. We may despair at the movement from the expansive freedom of the rolling landscape to the closed world of the gated estate. But we may also consider that, unlike Redmond Barry, we have the awareness and the means and the mobility to resist such a fate. Yet so often we choose not to.",Barry Lyndon

Handsome and well-spoken, the young Barry is still self-absorbed and in many ways stubborn and determined.

The final ""fate"" with which he meets (after 3 hours of viewing) is sure to deliver ""satisfaction"" to the audience.Kubrick's script received a nomination, but not the actual Oscar.

If he'd only made '2001' he'd still be considered a genius. Since he followed that with 'A Clockwork Orange' he moved up a notch to approach immortal status. But after making another 180 degree turn, taking on the historical novel/costume drama, and coming up with something this brilliant and stunning, well then, now was the time for deification. Has any director ever made three masterpieces in a row that were as different and as totally unique as these three?One of the most beautifully photographed of all movies, the film canvases Kubrick creates are glorious, interiors and exteriors alike. It almost seems then to be an embarrassment of riches for the film to have such an engrossing story and vivid characters as well. As is usually the case in the man's films, the movie itself is the star and the actors, no matter how well they perform, tend to be subordinate. In another director's hands, 'Barry Lyndon' might have been a star vehicle for Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson. Certainly they both do adequate jobs here in the best roles of their careers, but they can't help but be a little overwhelmed by the whole. Good performances in the supporting roles often get overlooked as well, for example those by Leon Vitali and Hardy Kruger, to name just two.Many have heard about the miracle Kubrick performed by filming this movie using only natural light or candlelight, but knowing or not knowing that wouldn't increase or decrease the viewer's enjoyment of this film one bit. Though he made two more excellent films after this one (with one more still to come!), 'Barry Lyndon' to me stands as Stanley Kubrick's last undisputed work of genius. Well... maybe 'The Shining.'",Barry Lyndon
115,Eternality,"Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.",10,26 August 2010,"This is one film that many will not even think of attempting. It is three hours in length, it is based on a novel written in 1844 documenting the rise and fall of an Irishman who becomes part of 18th century English nobility, and it stars no one popular. But there is one compelling reason that dwarfs all excuses not to watch the film - it is directed by the late Stanley Kubrick. The director of influential film masterpieces such as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Dr. Strangelove (1964), and A Clockwork Orange (1971), Kubrick is easily one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.Barry Lyndon is probably Kubrick's most underrated film, an extraordinary picture that so vividly evokes the time and mood of a distant past that one might have been inclined to believe that Kubrick had actually taken the hassle to travel back in time to film this. Shot by cinematographer John Alcott, who wins one of the film's four Oscars, Barry Lyndon is as beautiful as films get. Picturesque views of medieval England are captured with a wide lens that frequently zooms away from a focal point, giving 'eye-opening' visuals of classy architecture and elegiac costumes lived in and worn respectively by the noble people.Tremendous effort is made to film most of the interior scenes in natural light and in the 'enchanting hour' when everything radiates with misty perfection. Yet the most technically impressive aspect of Barry Lyndon remains to be the filming of interiors at night with the creative use of strategically-positioned candlelights which lend an almost warm, surreal touch to the film's already organic quality. Kubrick's eye for detail and his quest for the perfect shot (whose obsession with them is well-documented later in his career) will reward patient viewers because Barry Lyndon is simply innovative filmmaking in an old-fashioned setting.Ryan O'Neal plays the titular character Barry Lyndon opposite Marisa Berenson who is remarkable in her role as the widowed Lady Lyndon. Adapted from William Makepeace Thackeray's picaresque novel and written for the screen by Kubrick himself, the film is smartly split into two major acts - the unexpected rise of Redmond Barry who later becomes Barry Lyndon, and the decline of the latter whose acrimonious relationship with his stepson Lord Bullingdon primarily leads to his inevitable downfall.Despite the subject matter, Barry Lyndon is more engaging than one might have expected. Kubrick's use of classical music is a major reason and it could not have been more apt here with great selections like Handel's Sarabande. Another factor is the inclusion of several sequences of farcical duels between Barry and his 'nemesis' and war battles which feature brilliant tracking shots.Kubrick's films are mostly devoid of real emotions; they are mechanical, cold observations of society that are seldom optimistic. Barry Lyndon is no exception. Its frozen characters seem unable to dictate their lives; they feel trapped in Kubrick's masterful manipulation of a medium that so rarely embraces such a genre. Highly recommended, Barry Lyndon is cinema at its purest, and is without a doubt one of its great achievements.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Barry Lyndon
116,whatch-17931,The hype about the candle lit scenes is all you need to notice,3,25 December 2020,"The one red alert that this film is a plodding bore is when it's always brought up that the candle lit scenes were filmed with just candle light. Nicely technical achievement, but who cares? Even if you're in the industry? This can obviously be done with skilled traditional lighting and viewers generally couldn't care less, nor should they.This film is over three hours. Not much of a surprise that a story based on an obscure 19th century novel about a fictional character in Ireland didn't find a big audience.With some melodramatic music, this could be chopped up into maybe 10 parts and be quite similar to traditional American day time soap operas. The pacing and story beats fit perfectly. The reason soaps do (did?) that is not every viewer can catch a daytime show every day.The lengthy pauses by the actors is a hallmark. Of course, it's a soap with crazy good production values.",Barry Lyndon
117,jose-cruz53,A perfect film,10,29 September 2012,"A magnificent film, Barry Lyndon is pretty much a perfect overview of the 18th century European world, from the perspective of our protagonist, Redmond Barry. I consider Kubrick as one of my favorite directors (if I would be forced to rank him I would place him second on my list). Stunningly beautiful, in both visual and audial senses, its a movie to slowly contemplate. Indeed, Roger Ebert choose this film as one of his top 10 film of all time in 2012 for the Sign and Sound pool. It was a worthy choice as this film is perfect.The cinematography is beyond perfect. Kubrick planned to make each frame of this film look as much as possible as an 18th century paintings and indeed, each frame can be hanged over the wall. The film's score is also amazing, featuring a combination of 18th century classical music and more modern compositions. The score fits the film perfectly.The pacing is quite slow,, specially if compared to recent films, even in the 1970′s it was considered slow paced, however. But the pacing is relative because the film takes its time and the slower pacing doesn't hurt the experience of seeing the film, it improves it.",Barry Lyndon
118,Thrashman88,A Visually Stunning Masterpiece,8,7 February 2018,"Finally, after 42 years of neglect I got to watch Stanley Kubrik´s period masterpiece BARRY LYNDON. It´s a film best watched with a cup of red wine by your side. Although it moves at slow pace action wise, it is never boring. The costumes, the fine details of the era (the 18th century) are stunning to watch even in this age of high tech movie warfare. Still, as visually gorgeaus as this movie is, it is never really engaging. A lot of it, I think, comes from Ryan O'Neil's stiffer-than-a-corpse portrayal of Barry Lyndon. I don't know if his emotionless portrayal was done on purpose or if it's inherent of Mr. O'Neil's acting skills (think Keanu Reeves but much stiffer). BARRY LYNDON would've been much suited for a short mini-series. In that format, BARRY LYNDON's story would've been much more engaging.Humor is very present in a very subtle way, in the narration and in the story itself, yet in never borders on comedy at all. Despite being a 3 hour long movie, BARRY LYNDON goes by pretty quickly without ever being boring. Unlike other Kubrick films, there's little hidden meaning behind BARRY LYNDON with a very straight forward story and an ending that feels rather inclomplete.Still, BARRY LYNDON is a marvel to watch and an overall satisfying Kubrick film, but certainly not his pinnacle.",Barry Lyndon

The blue sky is reflected in the water, the castle on the green grass, the path in the forest, the dawn and dusk fog. Every scene is a beautiful landscape painting. The countess was pretty, though she did not play much part. Barry Linden is Love Story's Ryan O 'Neal, who has a kind, slightly bitter face, especially innocent eyes. Barry wasn't exactly the bad guy, at least in the moment when Viscount Brinton's gun went off in a duel. It was just fate. The whole film has a very classical charm, but the tempo is a bit slow. If there is enough time, it is still worth sitting down and watching.Remember my final conclusion: ""All that happened in the time of George III, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, is now buried.""",Barry Lyndon

The first half of this movie, with Barry conning his way through high society, is good. It is enjoyable to see Barry go from a poor boy in Ireland to marrying a woman with a title. Unfortunately, the film falls apart in its second half. Barry has become selfish and self absorbed. It is as if he were an entirely different person. It doesn't help that his primary foe is his equally selfish stepson. Since neither of these characters is very likable, my emotional involvement in this movie waned. Since this movie is one of those historical epics, we know what happens well before it occurs. That takes away the enjoyment of the movie, especially since the movie's ending is such a downer that you expect. This gets a 6/10 for this mixed bag of a movie.",Barry Lyndon

With a wonderful performance by Ryan O'Neal (although it might have been a bad idea to have him play the younger Barry), a wonderfully paced screenplay, and cinematography that rivals the great T Malick, he rifles us with an epic story of fortune gained and fortune lost. This film contains some extremely poignant moments, perfectly orchestrated and brought to life by O'Neal. At over 3 hours, however, BARRY LYNDON does test your patience. Towards the end, its hard not to get frustrated with Kubs. Still, the climax of the movie is some of the most intense stuff I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot).

124,antagonist117,"The closest thing to Kubrick's unmade ""Napoleon""",9,7 November 2013,"In ""Barry Lyndon"" we have echoes of how Stanley Kubrick's great un- made project, a biopic of Napoleon, may have looked and felt. It would have been stately, as ""Barry Lyndon"" is throughout, with perfectly still shots that linger on faces, or very slow pans and zooms of impeccable, symmetrical sets. It would have been steeped in period details, as ""Barry Lyndon"" is with its Georgian turns of phrase (a high-society woman is ""a woman of great fortune and condition""; to sympathize with another's circumstances is to be ""sensible"" of them) and its impressive mounds of powdered hair and layers of makeup on both men and women. Classical music would have abounded, as it does in most Kubrick films and no less so here. There would have been warfare on the continent in which soldiers marched against each other in tight, colorful ranks, and intriguing marital relations. The latter might have demanded more sustained attention in the hypothetical Napoleon film than it receives in ""Barry Lyndon,"" where the wife seems forever on the cusp of transmitting some insightful commentary but remains unsatisfactorily cipherous. Had ""Napoleon"" been made, its lead character would have had a rise-and-fall arc quite similar to Barry's in spite of their very different historical significances (incalculable in Napoleon's case, non-existent in the case of the fictional Lyndon). As it happened, ""Barry Lyndon"" is the movie we have, and it is a very good one. No other Kubrick work received as many Oscars (four), all of these in recognition of the film's technical accomplishments. Yet among the director's many masterpieces it has had a relatively low public profile. Could calling it ""Napoleon"" have elevated it into the top tier of his oeuvre in the minds of many fans? The added aura of historical import would have helped, but probably not enough: though the film is very finely-wrought, it lacks the more obvious eye-popping abstractions of a ""2001"" or the overt improprieties of a ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"" with which the name Kubrick is and was associated.",Barry Lyndon
125,daniewhite-1,Basically Leaden,7,6 October 2020,"Kubrick must surely rank as the oddest household name director and 'Barry Lyndon' typifies his style: three hours duration, amazing creativity and inspiration, and little sense of a complete film.Lacking in dramatic flow, apparent theme and narrative urgency there is however no denying that I followed all three hours of 'Barry Lyndon' without a lapse of concentration which says a lot for the film making abilities assembled for this production.In fact I was genuinely captivated by the artistry and the film makers confidence (or ego) which are both of splendidly high value in 'Barry Lyndon'.However, as a film fiction, a dramatic tale, I would rate a much lower score and reserve my complements.I have read that Kubrick had intended a Napoleonic war film as his next great project until the underperformance of 'Waterloo' put paid to financing.On balance I feel that more than just his research for that unmade film went into this adaptation of Thackeray's 'The Luck of Barry Lyndon'; indeed having some familiarity with Kubrick's other war films I find it likely that he intended an anti-war, anti ""big men"", anti aristocracy-warrior class Napoleonic film: a radical 1970's take on that eras rampant war making and glorifying.If this were so then the entire tone, and indeed purpose of 'Barry Lyndon' comes into focus: cynical, sceptical, critical of elites and militaries; all these fit the filmmaker and would fit snugly into a hypothetical unmade Napoleon movie.This would explain why the tone of 'Barry Lyndon' is so well developed but the themes and narrative are not and why some reviews feel that Kubrick missed the positives of the literary work he was adapting only to substitute them for less pertinent and challenging features.This then explains the wallowing in human fallacies and failures; the obsession with imperfections and inhumanty and the dallying with fate and destiny as a structure for the misdemeanors and mishaps of Lyndon and other characters.Aside from this speculation 'Barry Lyndon' must be seen to be believed and I consider it's technical gravitas to be so great and effective that it's a truly important and oddly watchable film despite it being mainly unfulfilling as a fictional depiction.Between a 10/10 on one hand and a 5/10 on the other I rate a compound 7/10 score and I recommend to all Kubrick fans and a sly recommendation to anti establishment film fans too!",Barry Lyndon
126,Gresh854,Another Kubrick Masterpiece,9,30 July 2018,"Barry Lyndon is one of the most captivating single-man journeys I've ever endorsed. The coinciding messages about the effect poverty or wealth can have upon an individual's character, ambitions, and actions are marvelously exhibited. The film's finale is as exhilarating as it is inventive, and proves itself as one of Kubrick's finest cinematic sequences. The narration the movie offers however, feels glaringly unecessary, but despite that, every other aspect of Barry Lyndon is all you could ever hope for in a Kubrick gem. (Verdict: A)",Barry Lyndon
127,brianberta,Another great entry into Kubrick's large body of films,9,14 January 2021,"I was surprised by how much I loved this film. I know it's a Kubrick film, but since I'm not a fan of historical dramas and given that Barry Lyndon is a middle child between four Kubrick films which are more well-known (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket), I was wondering if this would be one of his weaker films. But nope, Kubrick blew me away once again.A major theme of this film is the death of existentialism. Barry's attempts to use his wit and skills to secure a good outcome outside of the system make him an existentialist. These efforts are constantly undermined though. For example, though it initially seems like he kills John Quin in a duel, it's later learned that Quin didn't die and that the duel was a ruse to get rid of him. Also, his efforts of escaping to Dublin are undermined by being robbed. In addition, his plan to join the Seven Years' War to get a pension that will enable him to return home are undermined by his friend dying and, of course, never receiving the pension. Finally, his efforts of deserting the war are undermined by him being drafted into the Prussian Army. Since Barry was unable to change his fate and avoid becoming part of the system, his existentialist ideals fell flat.The latter parts of the first half are where Barry loses his existentialist ideals and becomes part of the system he attempted to avoid. Saving a Prussian soldier's life in the Seven Years' War is his first turning point. While he initially attempted to create a good outcome for himself by operating outside of the system (again, with no luck), he's now operating from inside the system and doing what those above him would want him to do. Except, he isn't quite ready to be a part of the system. Though he's operating from inside it now, he's yet to master the act of deception. While many people in the film deceived Barry up to this point, he's yet to do the same as Prussian Captain Potzdorf caught on to his last attempt. Eventually though, Barry and Chevalier successfully deceive the Prussians by escaping the country. Marrying Lady Lyndon serves as the final nail in the coffin to his existentialism, causing him to be a member of the system. He's now a deceiver who marries for class and uses violence to settle disputes, just like those around him. He wasn't able to escape this fate.Now is a good time to mention the cinematography. Most shots in the film are constructed to look like paintings, largely due to the abundance of wide angle shots and how the film was shot only in natural light. While this style is visually outstanding, it also adds to the film's themes. Of course, paintings never move regardless of how long or how many times you view them. They will always tell the same story. I think this aesthetic shows how Barry's story is neither special nor unique. Rather, the character traits we see of him are part of a pattern. Many other people had, have, and will have the same fate as Barry. For instance, though little is known about Barry's father, the first shot shows that he also used violence to settle disputes. In fact, a common camera movement in the film shows a close-up of Barry, only to pull back and reveal more and more of the setting he occupies. These shots show that Barry is less important to these frames than the scenery surrounding him is.The second half expands upon this generational pattern by detailing how Bullington becomes a faceless member of the system, just as Barry, Barry's father, and everyone else around them did. Much like Barry uses violence to solve conflicts with Bullington in the second half, Bullington uses violence to solve his own conflicts later on. Bullington also upholds the same existentialist ideals Barry had in the early stretches of the film, shown by how Bullington constantly defies Barry with the belief he can save his mother from him or how he later leaves the family estate. Like Barry though, Bullington's efforts are undermined. Defying Barry doesn't save his mother: it only results in him getting beaten. Leaving the family estate doesn't allow for him to operate outside the system: he later returns to the estate. Given this, Barry and Bullington are one and the same as they both end up operating inside the system, despite their efforts to avoid it. Just like a character in a painting, they have no free will and will always live in the same scene.In conclusion, this is another impressive addition to Kubrick's large body of films. I'm not sure where I'd rank it amongst his other films, but it's definitely a great film. If you haven't seen this film yet, I highly recommend doing so.",Barry Lyndon
128,Ziya90,With my kindest regards,10,24 December 2009,"Barry Lyndon is one of the greatest films of all time to me and sometimes it makes me think that is it the greatest movie ever made? When the film ended, I was so upset, I never had felt like that in another movie as I remember. It is not surprising that for some people, it is extremely dull and too long. Yes, it is not for the people who prefer fast paced movies or movies with fast editing. This is the fact that unconventional films are not appreciated mostly. As known, Kubrick was a perfectionist director, so he made perfect films, but Barry Lyndon is the best Kubrick movie to me. Honestly, I seriously got bored while watching The Killer's Kiss that is only 67 minutes! but did not get bored while watching Barry Lyndon even one second. When I saw the lettering ''Intermission'', I felt like no need for a break. The film is probably the most still, flowing, beautiful, artistic, reposeful and kindest film ever made and it is pure cinema. The way of story telling is very elegant, kind in every scene. The background music and narration make the movie much more mesmerizing. The coherence among the music, the narration and the content is great. And I want to say that the most magical narration is here The duel scene between Barry Lyndon and his stepson. Probably the longest duel in the history of cinema. This scene is my favorite scene of the movie, I would put it in the cinema anthology. I have never seen such a duel in my life. The foxy music warns us, something sad will happen. Tension gets higher, higher and higher. It is a mix of perfectionism, quintessential cinema and art. Barry Lyndon is not a good person as he is not evil. He entices Lady London, it is a liaison. Besides, later he makes something deadly. Although, he is guilty, he gets angry when Lady London's husband lectures him and so on. I try to mean that Barry Lyndon is a deep character study. As for its rating (once upon a time, one day it was in the list, the other day it was not.) it is a huge question mark.",Barry Lyndon
129,coop-16,Superb exploration of the Human Condition,10,28 April 2000,"This is not simply a ""costume drama"", it is an allegory-at  once darkly comic and profoundly moving- about the human condition.

Natural light taken to its extreme, painterly mise-en-scène and colour, wildly riotous humour. Death. Indeed, each frame exudes audaciously utter compositional mastery, and Kubrick paints with light and shadow in ways quite unmatched, perhaps equalled only by the virtuosity of Malick and Lubezki's.Kubrick, to my mind, is a superb humanist, somewhat like Imamura, yet his sense of humour is more approachable. The visual gags of the film are brilliant and hilarious. The first part of the film is fireworks from beginning to end, and it's the second part where Kubrick is able to offer a cataclysmic counterpoint that is decidedly slow in its accretion, escalating from the high-flying superficiality of Barry's character and his lack of forethought for the consequences of his actions. Or, if you like, things just befall him without any dramatic sense of cause and consequence.""The Draughtsman's Contract"" (1982) would be a fine place to go from here, since it's visually as painterly, made by a painter, influenced by another painter's notions.",Barry Lyndon
133,keelhaul-80856,Not Sure What all of the Fuss is About... Extremely boring and forgettable,3,9 April 2021,"I love Stanley Kubrick's films; I love Period Pieces and historical works; I do not love Barry Lyndon. This movie is so incredibly boring, with so much wasted time, that does nothing to further the plot or entertain the audience.Most of the film is just grainy shots of ugly men wearing fake moles and powder and makeup, while gambling or sitting around drinking. For a 3 hour run time, with great names attached, I had expected far more than this. Others have noted that Ryan O' Neal seems very miscast, and I must agree. His behavior, stance, and accent all seem stupid to me for this movie, or for an Irishman of the period. Very little happens in this movie, and I just didn't care about any of the characters. The charisma is on par with a sleeping sloth, and the plot and dialogue are about as interesting as waiting around in a doctor's office for an unpleasant procedure. Skip this and watch Ridley Scott's ""The Duelists"" instead. Even Mel Gibson's ""Patriot""(while inaccurate) is way better.I ordered this movie for a few bucks on Amazon, as it was one of the few remaining Kubrick works that I had never seen. I watched a third of it and went to bed. I watched the next third on the following day. On the third day, I watched some more, and then let the rental expire before finishing the last few minutes. I don't know what it is, but this movie just lacks anything funny, moving, exciting, intriguing, or horrifying at all. So much time is wasted just observing stupid looking people in powdered faces listening to famous classical music and sitting around gambling or whatnot. I was utterly bored the entire time. Even the battle scenes weren't really anything extra, and there is no one to root for. I found all of the folks very annoying and dry. It is like listening to a monotone children's play that puts you to sleep. Absolutely nothing happens, except some duels and poor life choices. The film quality sucks too. I have seen older Kubrick films that look crisp and vivid and clear to this day, but this looks like it was filmed by a potato in 1924. Not sure how this won so many awards or has an 8+ Imdb rating, but whatever....",Barry Lyndon
134,michael_the_nermal,Well Done Character Study. Not as Boring as its Detractors Claim.,8,28 August 2012,"Full confession: I have not read the William Makepeace Thackaray novel from which this movie was adapted, so I have no way to tell how true to the source material Kubrick made his film. Watching the film on its own, without any knowledge of the manner the characters were constructed or themes Thackaray tried to convey in his original novel, I regard it a solid effort. While Kubrick's body of film work is small yet memorable, I haven't seen all of his movies, but of those few that I have seen, ""Barry Lyndon"" seems like one of his better works. The film is an engaging and entertaining character study of an Irish rake who, through guile and luck, rises from a point of low social standing to become one of the members of the English aristocracy, only to fall again through his prodigal nature. Some critics have felt that Ryan O'Neal played the role of Redmond Barry (later titled Barry Lyndon after he married an aristocratic widow) in an uninspired and emotionless way. I disagree: O'Neal was certainly not effusive with his emotions, but neither was he dull or lifeless. He played the role credibly: Barry is more a subtle schemer than a demonstrative dandy. His background as an Irish farm boy who lived by his wits rather than his charm or book-smarts makes his understated character very believable; Barry is the ""strong silent type"" who will use guile to get what he wants, or, should that fail, his fists. The movie did not seem overlong; it is more a character study than a plot-driven drama. The movie is like a slow-moving stream that takes its time to explore every twist and turn in the reprobate Barry's life. It is fun to watch how Barry lifts himself up to a life of fortune, then lose it again. The film makes it easy to determine the character arc by dividing the story into two parts (and title cards explicitly describe the arc): part one is on Barry's rise to the top of the gentry, part two is on his fall. It is engaging to follow along, and is seldom dull or plodding. While O'Neal makes a positive impression as the protagonists, the other characters are fun to watch, too. The antagonist of the second half, Lord Bullingdon, is a great contrast to Barry: bitter, emotional, and quick to act in a clumsy or demonstrative manner. His hatred for Barry is easy to understand, and no doubt will gain some sympathy from the audience, though this sympathy is tempered a great deal by Bullingdon's dandyish, dull-witted and vindictive demeanor. Less interesting is the character of Lady Lyndon. She says almost nothing in the movie, and merely reacts to situations in a passive manner. Her character is dull and uninteresting. Lady Lyndon would have been more interesting if she spoke more often to either Barry or Bullingdon, and there was some visible anger or conflict towards either for their disgraceful behavior.With ""Barry Lyndon"", there is no doubt that Kubrick could make a beautifully-crafted yet subtly engaging character study that was just as good--if not better---than his shocking satires, like ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""A Clockwork Orange"". I understand some may balk at the apparently pat morality expressed in the movie--which seems like nothing more than a film version of ""A Rake's Progress"". Nevertheless, Kubrick has crafted a wonderful three-dimensional character in Redmond Barry, and watching his triumphs and failures are entertaining to watch, even if the protagonist is himself ultimately unsympathetic. Kubrick also proved that he had an eye for detail when making a period piece. The sets and costumes beautifully evoke the decadence of eighteenth century Europe. In all, ""Barry Lyndon"" lives on as an unsung masterpiece by Kubrick, and it deserves a reputation far better than has currently.",Barry Lyndon
135,drosse67,A Work of Art,10,22 August 2001,"Barry Lyndon, perhaps more than any other Stanley Kubrick film, is more of a work of art than a motion picture.  Kubrick was arguably one of the masters of the cinematic art form, however this particular movie is more like an exquisite still painting.  In fact, if you are lucky enough to own the recent digital transfer of this movie, you can freeze-frame any scene of the movie for proof of this--whether it's a great landscape or a more intimate scene of human interaction, the stills are breathtaking.  The story contains a lot of passion, despite Kubrick's trademark stand-offish characterizations.  Ryan O'Neal's performance seems to get better with age (who would have thought that?)  The three hours never drag.  This is definitely one of Kubrick's best, and most underrated, films.",Barry Lyndon

138,dkncd,The rise and fall of an opportunist,10,21 October 2007,"""Barry Lyndon"" is Stanley Kubrick's film about a fictitious Irishman, Redmond Barry, who lived during the reign of King George III. This film manages to impeccably capture a sense of period with wide shots of lavish and colorful sets, scenes and greenery as well as impressive works of art and architecture. The film also includes an effective combination of classical pieces and marching music that comprise the score.This film's story is developed with a slow-pace intended to make the film more thoughtful than entertaining. This is reinforced by the inclusion of a narrative and the division of the story into two parts. Sometimes narratives are unnecessary for a film or even a hindrance, but in this case the thoughtful and clever prose was beneficial to the film. The first part of the story chronicles some scenes from Barry's early life and his military career. The military displays and battle scenes proved captivating even though the battles were brief and highlighted the inept tactics used in the Seven Years' War.The second part shows the troubled married life of Redmond and his interactions with the English nobility. Personally I found the first part to be the more interesting of the two, but ultimately both parts told an interesting story. Both parts show duels, whether with pistols or swords, that are engaging without being embellished.Ryan O'Neal leads the cast as Redmond Barry. O'Neal's acting regimen largely consists of speaking in low tones, casting lingering gazes and occasional bursts of emotion. None the less, he creates an interesting character that is despicable in many ways but sympathetic in others. The film also has excellent supporting performances. Marisa Berenson gives a fine performance as Barry's careworn wife, Lady Lyndon. Leon Vitali is also excellent as Lord Bullingdon, a bitter son from Lady Lyndon's prior marriage. The animosity between Barry and Bullingdon is well-developed and striking. Frank Middlemass was effective at showing palpable and perceptive disdain for Barry as Sir Charles Lyndon. I also enjoyed Leonard Rossiter's performance as the proud man of airs, Captain John Quin. Overall ""Barry Lyndon"" is interesting as a slowly paced but well-developed period film.",Barry Lyndon

It is beautiful to watch - the cinematography, design, the costumes, and even the hairstyles are magnificent. But there is a problem here. The main character is a prick. Barry is a roguish adventurer and a con artist - not an easy man to love. Btw I am usually not the guy who says, ""the hero needs to be more likeable"" but in this case I found myself thinking it. In the mid 1700s a young, bold, arrogant Irishman finds himself hitting the road after a duel, joining the British army, and conniving his way around Europe, finally wheedling his way into a marriage with a wealthy, titled widow. Barry does eventually get what is coming to him, something Kubrick's narrator informs the audience of well in advance. O'Neal looks the part, but his feeble Irish accent is a drawback. As a sweeping 18th century drama the film certainly deserves respect.",Barry Lyndon
140,calspers,...Aristocratic perfection by Kubrick - but...,8,8 February 2019,"This film by Stanley Kubrick is perhaps my least favorite of his. It is still an excellent film, which says it all about Kubrick - one of the greatest film making artists to have walked this Earth.A perfect aspect about the film is its script, which I find magnificent as an adapted screenplay by Kubrick. To me this is mere perfection. Incredible linguistic detail, perfectly casted unto almost every actor and actress. An example hereof is the wedding scene (no spoilers).But... the film did not move me much - I simply did not find it touching (albeit technically perfect), and this is my issue with the film. At best, I was close to emotionally engaged in a scene between Lord Bullingdon and Barry Lyndon.Back to its technical merits:
Cinematography is - as always in a Kubrick film - fantastic and astonishing. Here with elaborate use of interesting zoom-outs, wide shots, and tracking shots from the brilliant Kubrick cinematography, revealing the beautiful British landscapes.Great score - albeit demanding classical pieces to my ears.Inviting narrative style, and an excellent directional choice of my liking.All in all, I believe the life of Barry Lyndon is magnificently portrayed by one of the greatest masters of the art form, but lacking in emotion.",Barry Lyndon
141,RIK-22,A beautiful work of Art,9,24 December 1999,"A couple of years ago I caught the end of a movie on TV that captivated for the brief time it was on.  Finally 2 years later I get the DVD.Initially the story was a bit slow, but nevertheless intriguing.  As the movie progress I got more and more drawn in.  Again Kubrick has done it, he doesn't use the camera by zooming in and out and using slow motions etc, he is able to simply set up a scene with detail and perfection then let the actors do the rest.Everyone complains that books to film never works.  Often the reason is trying to emphasise the emotion and thought process that takes place is very easy in a book, but very hard on film.  Kubrick just added narration and got the actors to not over-act and it worked perfectly.I could go on and on, but it's been said before.  I imagine a lot will say this film is long and boring and it has no story. The reason is we're all conditioned to be told who the good guys are, who's right and wrong.  This is not the case we don't feel for the main character until the scene with his son (which was so well done).This has lots of similarities to 2001, lots of meticulous detail, lots of silences and subtleties.  As in 2001, this is more than a film, it is a work of art and should be experienced rather than just watched.",Barry Lyndon
142,thedarkhorizon,"Opulent, beautiful - paintings come to life; Kubricks often overlooked masterpiece.",8,21 November 2019,"Save to say - I avoided watching this wonderful 3 hour long epos for many years, because 2001 or the Shining seemed more thrilling. What made me finally watch it was the art of KEN ADAMS, the brilliant production designer for many Kubrick films (2001!) and this was one of the rare films where he had to use sets on location. And got an Oscar for it. So - time to watch this, jeez!I must say: I was overwhelmed by the raw power of the images. Old dutch paintings came to life and each detail was thought through. The film lives through his brilliant actors, but also the slow zoom out, the image compositions, the (mostly natural (or inspired by natural light situations...) light and the intense making process impressed me for sure. --- Man, did you know they used a NASA camera lens that was 0.7 aperture due to Kubricks idea of filming interior scenes with candle light? Or that they had to use camera light filters excessively because they traveled 8 months through France, Germany and Ireland to get these amazing, wide angle painting like shots and the weather kept changing every minute? That impressed me a lot... because it looks so easily done, but hell yes, to make such a masterpiece, you need madness and true passion (Kubrick had it!).
He caused Ken Adam to have some break downs and for sure, it did not seem to be easy to work with Kubrick. But all the locations they chose for the period piece, all the landscapes - they are on point. Adam impresses not only in studio, but on location, big time.The film impresses BECAUSE it tries to give us a (still altered, still artificial, yep...!) glimpse into the 17th century: war, love, monarchy and the fate of a normal man. It feels oddly real and oddly relatable, not only because of the story, but how it is told visually. I was visually pleased throughout the whole movie and am grateful that I finally watched it. It is for sure one of my favorite Kubrick films, because it tells the story of fate and mankind - this time set back few centuries before our time (not in the future like 2001), but asks similar questions... what is fate and what is coincidence? And are we all equal?
Yes - we are: in life, in death, in our human needs.WONDERFUL masterpiece, can only recommend watching it.PS: Can't stop thinking that it inspired also the film THE FAVORITE (2019), as it works sometimes with similar tones and techniques... and a similar story.",Barry Lyndon
143,TheFilmGuy1,Amazingly Beautiful,9,13 July 2014,"Barry Lyndon is quite the film. I had heard this was Kubricks most slow film, and while it did feel slow in certain areas, most of the time it had me enthralled. It's a beautiful and epic film, and because of it's length (3 hours and 5 minutes), you really get the feeling you have seen this mans life. I think I will start off with just the visuals of this movie. Wow. The costume and set design in this are absolutely incredible. It's also shot incredibly well. It's no surprise why it won Oscars in those categories. The whole time I watched it, I kept thinking that it didn't feel like a movie. I never imagined the cameras and crew standing there. It felt like I was witnessing people in this time period. Like I was actually there. That's the highest compliment you can give a period piece film. Every shot is beautifully framed and looks like a painting, which was actually what they aimed to do. Visually, it will just blow you away.The story is pretty great to. It spans over a large amount of time, and lots of different things happen. There are little sections where it felt like, to me, that nothing new was happening and that made the film drag a bit, but those sections were fairly short lived. The performances overall are pretty great. Ryan O'Neal sometimes left me a little underwhelmed, but he had his moments, and I thought that he did a good job when he really needed to perform. All the other side characters are great too. Everyone just seems to fit their roles. Barry Lyndon is a film that needs to be seen if you are a fan of films. It's absolutely beautiful and is quite the experience over all. Check it out.",Barry Lyndon
144,Kubris,Hate it or love it,7,17 May 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 217Barry Lyndon is a tough film. On one hand, it's beautiful: the countryside is gorgeous, the costumes are amazing, the sets are luscious, and they tried to get as many candlelight shots in as possible. But on the other hand, there's a very plain, straightforward story about an indifferent character with little substance and far too much time. There's a distinct division in taste in this film.The Revolutionary War era is severely underrepresented in film, and with good reason: it's difficult to make an interesting story. When your film opens to a sexual game played between cousins, it's easy to be put off. It's also easy to be put off by the sternness everyone carries. And the white faces. The era is unfriendly to film, but Kubrick made it as digestible and believable as possible.However the story is pure nihilism. Barry starts out likable if boyish, but develops into something else, which like Alex deLarge leads to some mixed emotions. But Barry isn't charismatic, and seems very wooden at times. It's difficult to read him. All of the characters are flawed, but not in an interesting way: Lord Bullingdon (say that name a few times, how can you not hate him) is a snake, lacking honour. Lady Lyndon is a miserable mess who we can never sympathize with, and Ma Barry is not unlike her counterpart in The Manchurian Candidate. No one is consistently likable, so the story is never appealing. Especially since it doesn't go anywhere, or have any meaning. Sure, that's the point, but 3 hours to tell a story that could be summed up in a sentence is ridiculous. I'm all for epic length films, as long as they're engaging: Barry Lyndon is not. Barry Lyndon is a divisive film, so to help you if you decide to watch it, here are my pointers: first, brush up on your history by looking up the Seven Years War. Next, take a picture of a candle and see how it turns out. And lastly, know the moral of the story, that you're not important. With those pointers, you'' have a much more enjoyable time watching the film than I did, because despite its high production values it just couldn't grab me. Not Kubrick's best. 7.5/10",Barry Lyndon

There may be people out there who may not be as fond of this film as I am, but I can't possibly imagine someone who would deny that Barry Lyndon is one of the most beautiful movies they have ever seen. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking. It's a long movie, but it went by really fast for me, I was thoroughly engaged, wondering what would happen next. And this is a movie filled with long scenes in which people just stare at each other very subtly, but because of how expertly crafted every shot is, how the music blends into that beautiful cinematography and the great performances, I find it very difficult not to love this movie.",Barry Lyndon
146,lucasversantvoort,Social study disguised as 18th century painting,8,5 May 2015,"Barry Lyndon has always been a curious film in Kubrick's filmography and is rarely mentioned as anyone's favourite. Even for his small amount of films, Kubrick has been known for his variety, but even audiences back in the day must've been surprised to see him tackle a costume drama. But since it's Kubrick, we're obviously not dealing with just any costume drama After being treated to a particularly dramatic performance of Handel's Sarabande, the film opens with protagonist Redmond Barry's father being shot in a duel. Barry falls in love with his cousin Nora, but though she shows interest in him, she plans to marry a rich English Captain. Frustrated, Barry shoots the Captain and is forced to flee to Dublin. The film follows his trials and tribulations as he roams the countryside in search of fortune, eventually makes a name for himself, but by that time the demeaning sides of his personality ensure his inevitable ruin.A curious thing indeed to see Kubrick tackle the costume drama genre. The trick, however, is to remember what Kubrick's all about. What is one of the key themes that defines pretty much every one of his films? I'd say a cynical, yet still sympathetic view at the folly and arrogance of man. Seen from this angle, you start to understand Barry Lyndon a little bit better. Once you literally peer beneath the incredibly shiny veneer and look at the inhuman underbelly of the world of Barry Lyndon, you can see what Kubrick's trying to do. When you think about it, it's actually a stroke of genius, Kubrick applying his notions of human indecency and arrogance to what is literally the most beautiful time period in human history.The film's central character, Barry, is also curious in that the film always seems to maintain a certain distance from him even though he's almost in every scene. But this hides the fact that his development is crucial to understanding Kubrick's intent. It's not for nothing we find Barry constantly frustrated in love in the film's first half and then see him neglect his wife in the second half. It's not for nothing he shoots his cousin's marriage prospect, the Captain, when he finds out she wants to marry him for reasons of wealth, only for him to do something similar when he marries Lady Honoria Lyndon. In a sense, Kubrick structures his film like Full Metal Jacket: in two halves. Just like how Full Metal Jacket first shows the dehumanization process the recruits are forced to undergo followed by its inevitable consequences, so does Barry Lyndon first portray Barry's struggle for success which is inexorably accompanied by his losing some of his humanity, the consequences of which are shown in the second half.The film's combination of period style and cynicism is also what lends the film its own particular brand of humor as seen in scenes like the early robbery scene. It's actually a tragedy and an injustice that Barry is being robbed, but the robber's polite manner lends it a strangely humorous quality. All the trauma and indecency is buried for the sake of appearance. Indeed, it's how everything looks that rules the minds of the characters and the particular time period. Kubrick was definitely trying to show how, despite it being a time of great beauty (who can forget the groundbreaking candlelight scenes?) and despite humans attempting to create a veritable fortress of beauty and blocking out all manner of cruelty, cruelty isn't something that can be so simply removed from human nature, but is inextricably bound to it.Of his most famous films, Barry Lyndon is also probably the most underrated which is a shame, because it contains many of the familiar themes we associate with Kubrick. I'm not going to pretend I loved it from the start. When I first saw it in my late teens I was quite underwhelmed. I couldn't see how the Kubrick of 2001 and Clockwork Orange could make such aslow, long, almost boring (for my teen spirit) film like Lyndon. But once I familiarized myself with Kubrick's style, I started to realize I seriously needed to reevaluate my opinion of it. The film's deliberately slow pacing and the 'artsy' distance it maintains from its characters not only hide, but are also part of, the film's focus on the toxic relationship between the superficial surface beauty of the 18th century and the unhappiness and immorality it tries to hide.",Barry Lyndon
147,adrongardner,"Opulent, Articulate, Masterwork",10,11 February 2004,"Simply put, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is the most impeccable piece of film I have ever seen. There is an incredible sense of depth and care to every image in the film.  The quality of the imagery is absolutely perfect.  Kubrick also goes to great length to convey the dry nature of the world Redmond Barry roams.  To paraphrase Ferris Bueller, ""Everything is very cold and very beautiful.""  I have heard many people call this film BORING.  That comment just means they have a short attention span.  This isn't a movie for the ""Fast and the Furious"" crowd. The characters are interesting and dynamic. The problem is, the world these characters inhibit isn't dynamic. It's static and Redmond tries and tries to fit in.  No matter what he tries, his fallacies draw out conflict in one form or another. The saddest of these is in the death of Redmond's son and the fall out with his wife and step-son.Barry Lyndon works on so many levels; technically, photographically, dramatically, and ultimately Artistically.  Even more amazing is how Kubrick turned a wordy busy novel into a quiet, powerful drama. This work is a reflection of the master status Kubrick deserves. A photographer who is obsessed with perfection in his images. And a filmmaker who is obsessed with cinema.  For me, Barry Lyndon is an unforgettable work of art.",Barry Lyndon

150,FilmSnobby,"Gorgeous, brilliant, ironic, lifeless.",7,30 May 2004,"Goes down as Kubrick's Last Great Movie. (Though seeing as how he made only three more movies, it's not as if there was a long decline.) *Barry Lyndon* was a return to form, after that wretched *Clockwork Orange* -- meaning, he refrains here from allowing his general misanthropy to get the better of his judgment. The director managed to relocate a sense of rueful pity for humanity with this work.Kubrick takes the old tale of the Rake's Progress and transforms it into something altogether new. Based on an unimportant (and unread) early novel by Thackeray, *Barry Lyndon* chronicles the rise of a middle-class Irish lad from British soldier to professional gambler to master of a great estate via an advantageous marriage. It's set in the 18th century, beginning roughly with the Seven Years War and ending rather ominously in 1789 (Kubrick tantalizes us with this important date at the end of the film, but we're not sure what to make of it). While Kubrick's presentation of the period is peerless, his main character is a liability that drags the film down from masterpiece-level to merely excellent. Most reviewers have attributed this failing to Ryan O'Neal, but astute students of Kubrick's films know better. This director, throughout his career, was simply unable to achieve what Harold Bloom has called the ""Shakespearean difference"", that is, the creation of character. (Name a memorable main character from a Kubrick film that isn't a total caricature.) Redmond Barry (later Barry Lyndon, after his marriage) is an intellectual's IDEA of a Rake: we're TOLD that he's a scoundrel, but Kubrick can't be bothered to put in all that hard work that's required to SHOW us the evidence. He's far more interested in Mood and Theme -- not always such a bad thing in and of itself, but subservience of Character to these other concerns leaches away the impetus for great drama. Even the scenes in which Barry is cheating on his wife are merely snapshots -- and stylized ones at that, in the typically overintellectualized manner of Kubrick -- designed to inform us that, yes, he's a scoundrel. But in any case, Barry ""reforms"" pretty quickly once he's married, so that later accusations of his ""brutality"" seem unfair. Doubtless this is because Kubrick was going for High Tragedy rather than a character study. But the greatest artists manage to combine both efforts.While I've went on about the film's main faults, don't let these distract you from checking out the film. *Barry Lyndon* is very much worth your time. This is Kubrick's most wittily ironic, and most cleverly constructed work. One marvels at the director's repeated and varied use of his chosen motifs: card-playing, horses, lost loves, and most particularly, duels. Duels between man-and-man involving pistol and ten paces; duels between man and social caste; duels between man and state; duels between states. The overriding mood is unending, repetitious struggle. Barry's antagonists are legion in the film: he's always fighting somebody, or struggling against insuperable barriers in order to achieve his goals. The movie also has something to say about tribal warfare and what Jean Renoir called ""the rules of the game"". Barry can play cards, but he doesn't know how to play by the rules of the tribe he wishes to join. Hence his misfortunes in the second half of the movie.Kubrick, under the guise of a romantic period piece, offers us a sterile world in which human beings are denied the capacity for change and growth. The Tribe circles its wagons; tragedy is repetitious. Throughout most of the film, any scene indicating sentiment is immediately trashed by an ironic follow-up. (It's not until late in the film that Kubrick takes things seriously and drops the ironic mask.) All the while, monotonous pieces by Handel and Schubert drone on the soundtrack, underlining the repetitiousness of the entire work. (Handel's ""Saranbande"" is constantly in the background during the final half-hour.) Kubrick even has his narrator ""spoil"" the ending with 40 minutes still to go, because he wants us to marvel at his design rather than be held hostage to the plot (which, given its episodic nature, admittedly isn't much).Finally, Kubrick broke new technical ground with *Barry Lyndon* with the use of camera lenses that, for the first time, could capture indoor light without professional arc lamps and such. The interior shots in the candlelight are just that -- no fancy lighting tricks. Every period-piece owes this film a debt. In fact, most have failed to live up to this movie's example . . . but then, most directors aren't as nuttily obsessed with visual composition as Kubrick was. The final result is a period film that hasn't aged: with the one exception of the then-trendy use of camera zooms (instead of cuts), the film would look as if it were made today instead of in 1975. This is truly one of the most beautiful-looking movies ever made.",Barry Lyndon

It surprises me that this film has been forgotten and overshadowed by his other films, as it is almost as breathtaking as 2001, and as well crafted as all of his later films. This should, and hopefully is ranking among cinema history's greatest epic films. The only other film of the same genre (and length for that sake), that captivated me as much as this film did, was Coppolas ""The Godfather"". This film deserves to be as revered and commonly know as that film is. It is of course not Kubricks all time greatest motion picture,but should still rank as on of histories greatest motion pictures, as should all of his films be.

152,Camoo,Kubrick's best film,10,1 February 2013,"I know that the statement 'Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best film' is controversial. Really his films can't be weighed against each other, and obviously I speak for myself. Although I STRONGLY believe that statement - I will amend it and say simply that it's my favorite film, and yes, I do hold this film in higher regard than any other. Don't ask me why but there's something about it that makes me come back to it year after year, sometimes multiple times a year.. I think it is a miracle of cinema.It is also a deeply subversive and ironic film that takes your expectations of what a period romance or swashbuckling adventure should be and turns it around, providing you with neither. The opening shots are hazy in the style of a gaudy romance, but this is all quickly undermined when we begin to understand who Barry Lyndon is. He surely is one of the most empty and lazy 'protagonist's ever put to film, so much so that one can hardly call Barry a protagonist as he seems to try so hard to do or succeed at nothing.But somehow we are entranced by his character, and our fascination grows as the lies he tells and ripples he creates throughout the story begin to affect others. He builds a tower around himself which is always threatening to topple. There is a point near the end of the film where you feel Barry staring off, blinking, as though he has just woken up out of his own dream. It's as if he has no idea how he got there.The film is even more moving to watch today - the fact that people still call films 'films' when so much is just video.. Watching Barry Lyndon is watching the cinematographic process at its peak. It has to be one of the most beautiful films ever shot, (and one of the most perfectly lit). It's like a painting come to life. I'm saddened to see the medium of film die out in the way that it is, it makes Barry Lyndon feel all the more like a lost treasure. I urge you to see it, it's one of a kind.",Barry Lyndon
153,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,A Visual Feast,9,26 April 2013,"Most of Kubrick's presentations are pretty non-conventional, except for a few films such as 'Spartacus', 'Paths of Glory' and 'Barry Lyndon'. You're never quite sure what you're going to get with a Kubrick film, but with Barry Lyndon it's a pretty straightforward plot told with a running narrative.I do have a few gripes with the film such as its overly long running time at three hours, as well as its slowness in certain areas, especially at the beginning. Some of the characters are rather wooden and there's a certain dated feel about the production, but that's pretty much my criticism all used up.Contrary to the opinion of a minor amount of reviewers, Ryan O'Neal's performance is very believable. His aura lacks a little in conviction for the part, many feel, but I can't find anything wrong with it, neither the choice to cast him as Barry Lyndon. Even his Irish accent is tolerable. There are many memorably frail/weedy characters in the film such as Catptain Quin, Reverend Runt and Lord Bullingdon, but who only succeed in reinforcing Ryan O'Neal's character as a strong, competent and pretty straightforward opportunist, instead of the sneaky, snivelling sort of character that perhaps we might expect.Marisa Berenson is absolutely out of this world in terms of cold, dignified and unamused beauty. She is the catalyst of the stunning characteristics of this film. She has very little to say and practically no personality throughout, living her life in a permanently formal and non-amused bubble, but her simple portrayal of out-of-sight dignity is compelling. She gets more distant and gradually sadder as the film progresses, even her incredibly stylized wigs getting greyer over time too.Continuing on the theme of beauty, Marisa Berenson loses by a slender nose to the unbelievable camera work. Kubrick uses a long lens to imperceptibly zoom in on the action, then panning back to reveal the whole scene being filmed. His choice of scenery is without doubt the defining characteristic of this film. Generally, I don't consider beautiful imagery or colours to be a very important aspect of good film-making, but in Barry Lyndon it's the aspect that I enjoyed the most. The costumes are wonderful, but the outdoor landscapes and panoramic scenes are better still. The choice of autumnal colours and historic backdrops is a sight to behold and each time you see the film you appreciate how much thought went into filming certain scenes.If you're looking for style and content, narrated at a leisurely pace, you can't go far wrong with Barry Lyndon.",Barry Lyndon

But when Nora gets a marriage proposal from the English captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter), Barry challenges the captain to a duel with pistols that he end's up wining, but badly affects his family because the captain was rich and that marriage would save his family from suffered debts. Barry decides to run away to Dublin, but after being robbed on the road, he lists himself in the British Army to fight in the Seven Years' War, but ends up deserting it after the loss of a friend. Barry then ends up fleeing to Prussia and lists himself in the Prussian army and ends up saving the life of his captain becoming his personal spy. But the Prussian captain sends Barry to spy the Irish gambler Chevalier Balibari (Patrick Magee), but Barry just helps Chevalier fleeing the country and becomes his protégé and best friend. And later seduces and marries the noble Lady Honoria Lyndon (Marisa Berenson) where he finally wins the title of Lord Barry Lyndon that long after only brings him suffering and anguish.Kubrick as always delivers a flawless script followed with a beautiful narrative also giving the film the language of the time with the highest English accent put to film, but every moment of the film Kubrick changes the tone of the story. The film is divided in three acts: The 1st act with Barry going poverty in Ireland and finally reaching wealth in England, the film follows a rhythm sometimes romantic when Barry is with her cousin and when he meets a lover in Prussia, and also with a certain humor at times when Barry flees the British army stealing the horses of two soldiers who appear to be gay and when he helps Chevalier flee from Prussia disguising himself of Chevalier while the real one fled; The 2nd act we see the rise of poverty to wealth of Barry and his great personality change, while in Ireland he was a young man with ideas of freedom and now he is a real greedy man thinking only about his fame and wealth and well-being of his little and sweat heir, becoming a real Oswald Kane; On the 3rd and last act after a sad event we see the decline in the life of Barry starting to lose everything that he built, and as I said before becoming a real Oswald Kane someone who has everything but at the same time has nothing .And once again, in technical aspects Kubrick presents us with a real spectacle of photography and direction. Not only the photography that is beautiful, but in the film Kubrick delivers an amazing wardrobe, as if it had been done in that time, and with stunning views (certainly the most expensive Kubrick film before ""Full Metal Jacket"").A film that may not please many or stay in memory, but the demonstration of Kubrick of this era and aesthetic study that he makes of the time through an excellent narrative and a beautiful direction with a luxury cast. Barry Lyndon may be the ""Citizen Kane"" of Kubrick with the philosophical study of man with a beautiful story, with technical aspects on top of the ceiling and the photography at the top of Kubrick, ""Barry Lyndon"" is another of his masterpieces! 10/10",Barry Lyndon
155,denis-23791,"Epic, historic, ironic: What goes around, comes around",7,17 December 2020,"I'm not a big fan of epic history movies. A very long story of a man's life who always did the wrong thing, even when he was right. Very well performed and comic at times thanks to the ironic depictment and narration, with a Lady Chatterley type lighting and emphasis on 18th century British manners. If life's a gamble, be prepared to lose it all (again).",Barry Lyndon
156,Det_McNulty,"Kubrick Puts Fourth The Regretful Journey Of One Man's Life Majestically, Epically and Dramatically Through Celluloid",10,18 December 2006,"Stanley Kubrick for many is considered the finest director to of ever graced the earth. Famous for managing to capture so much detail in one frame of delight, even in the darkest and deadliest moments of his films he retains a naturally deliberate comedic affect. I've always been a great fan of ""Kubrick cinema"" as he's managed to tell devastatingly bleak tales of life and death with such ease and rhythm. Fact is Kubrick knows how you should tell a story through film.Barry Lyndon is a film that has an extensive range on offer to its viewers and with grand visual openness. From the narrative opening showing a fire-armed duel, in a gloomy Irish setting and a long-haul shot of the two men standing across from one-an-other, you automatically know you in for a cinematic treat. The film follows the Irish rouge Barry Lyndon's life; he's not from a wealthy background and strives to become a wealthy British aristocrat during the annoyances of the 18th century Seven Year European War.Barry Lyndon stands out as a true cinematic delight, a masterpiece if you will and a genuine epic classic that has stood the test of time and remains one of the best films ever made. Barry Lyndon came out in the pinnacle of the 70s and managed to receive many awards and praise from critics. I've always adored Barry Lyndon, but it wasn't until a repeat viewing that I finally decided it's my favourite film. Some have called Barry Lyndon ""repetitive"" or as ""flawed beauty"", I see those as foolish opinions because to appreciate the film you have to be able to understand it by looking deeper than what's obvious to the viewer. The film is not remotely ""dull"" or ""repetitive"" because it's a film that grasps you throughout the stretch and pulls you into one man's compelling quest through life.Barry Lyndon has become somewhat of an uncommonly mentioned film that has been forgotten by many and yet remains loved and hailed by others. It's a story that is structured precisely to the minute details and adapted with outstanding delicate appreciation to William Makepeace Thackeray novel.Like most Kubrick films it has subtle humorous undertones and devastating moments of dramatic parallels help make the film have the glorious variety throughout the three hour running time. The story is structured so delicately that there is not a single moment where you're not enthralled or captivated from one of the film's examples of overwhelming excellence. The pacing never falters, nor does it lose any of the originality it holds. There's so much on offer in one frame that you'll want to replay a single still-shot over and over.Kubrick is a perfectionist and he's famous for having that personality trait, his arrogant and compulsive attitudes have managed to bring some of his actors to the verge of breakdown. Werner Herzog is another artistic genius who has some insane traits surrounding his work, but don't they say ""even the greatest artists are a little mad"".The cinematography is some of the most luxurious your eyes will ever have the absolute pleasure of meeting. Even in the most shattering, sorrowful and heart-wrenching moments of the film there's a suppressing beauty withering its way onto the screen. The wonderfully impressive shots of the British countryside setting the scenes for the overwhelming clouds with pouring sunlight squeezing its way through show the comprehensive beauty the world has on offer. The fact the film was shot in natural light, it shown through the wide and ambitious landscape surrounding Barry Lyndon. It shows how there is such a great deal of life surrounding us all and yet we seem blissfully unaware of this.Generally the film's technical aspects cannot be described by anything less than perfect. The mesmerising classical score the film holds helps to create the cold and anti-humanist idea the film is portraying. Another prime feature of Barry Lyndon is that Kubrick found his motivation through some of the 18th century's painters who have obviously helped Kubrick decide what costumes would be able to illustrate the period in time. Easily some of the most impressive and detailed items of clothing ever put on screen, deserving the Oscar for ""Best Costume Design"". The set pieces are also a fantastic part of the film and the realism is stunning. The use of British heritage to set the scenes for some of the housing, the sweeping fields of hills, the winding roads and the ruined half-castles provide the needed pragmatism.Some films that revolve around one character's travels can fail to capture the audience, but Barry Lyndon manages to expertly lead you through the shoes of Mr. Lyndon's life. You'll notice how his character changes as the film progresses, some of his characteristics, habits and usual emotions change. The film studies the arrogance, lying charm and sly individualism surrounding the anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal shows-off his outlandish and shy acting style perfectly with what is one of the untouchable performances of the 70s.The film remains a film buff's dream, a director's ambition and a historian's paradise. My all-time favourite film and one that remains one of the greatest achievements cinema has on offer, I beg you to watch this.",Barry Lyndon
157,Tashtago,Kubrick's last masterpiece,8,8 May 2020,Although the films that followed Barry Lyndon all have their merits. For me this was the final time that Kubrick made a film that is close to perfection. Ryan O' Neal who I never liked before is surprisingly effective in the title role. He even gets to display his skills as a boxer in one key segment of the movie. The epic sweep of the life of Barry Lyndon with it's many twists and turns makes the film engrossing from beginning to end. Kubrick's wonderful photography captures the spirit of the time like a landscape painting by Gainsborough. The music as well is used memorably and stays with the viewer long after the movie has ended. A must see for Kubrick fan's as it's probably his most overlooked work.,Barry Lyndon
158,TheAnimalMother,Death Or Glory - Just Another Story,8,21 August 2021,"In terms of story this is on the surface at least, the simplest thing Kubrick ever made. However in terms of the technical aspect, it must have been one of his most challenging. The plot is basically about how greed, arrogance and ignorance can easily become the ruin of a man. The story itself is well told, but mostly quite simple as I said. The humor keeps us interested in the story, as does its undeniable visual beauty. It is not a stretch to say that this must be among the most beautiful looking films ever made. Every scene is filmed in all natural light, whether it be by sun or fire, and the landscapes and architecture handpicked by Kubrick himself are amazing. As in all Kubrick films, so much attention to small details equates to a great result in the end. Spielberg himself has called this film ""possibly the most beautifully shot film in history."".In terms of story, it's entertaining, in terms of it's technical achievement, the film is a landmark. Even for all the story's simplicity, there is a startling statement in the film that certainly can give the viewer real pause and thought. The finality of this world, the equality of all things in the end. It is certainly an interesting, powerful and very humbling down to earth observation. It is the kind of worldly observation that could perhaps lead some people to ruin, and yet lead others to strive for perfection. Perhaps that is part of Kubrick's thinking here, a Kubrickian challenge if you will, as he certainly was always an artist that was challenging his viewers. That through this observation people may become more aware of what they're leaving behind in this world...as one day, we will all equally be gone. For all the things written about this film, it is probably not nearly as unimportant of a story as many critics have said of it. Then again, critics and moviegoers alike have long been trying to catch up to Stanley, and never the other way around. 8.5/10.",Barry Lyndon
159,TexasRedge,this was okay,5,9 April 2002,"I usualy like two types of movies,movies about the old world like this one, and modern space epics like star wars and star trek. and this one falls under the same catagory as films like ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" or ""The Patriot"", only thing is that those films are much better than this one.- however this is one of the most beautifuly cinematography in a movie that I ever seen,Ddespite the Bazaar way this film plays out. I dont believe any film has ever captured the feel of the late 1700's better than this film did. the costumes are great,and sets are perfect. I also liked the whole natural light method in which this film was made.And the story is set into 2 halves, the first half is the rise Redmon Barry, and the 2nd half is the fall of Barry Lyndon(who are the same person)I even liked the narration of this film(I normaly despise narration- but the narration worked perfect for this film). This is a very classy film, and all of the actors did an outstanding job.(BTW:this film won 4 oscars). I reccomend this film, -you may or may not like it(I liked it but will also admit that other films in this same genre will blow it away -I found it interesting that a box set was released in 2000 with all of Kubrick's films in it- but this one(Barry Lyndon)was the only Kubrick film not in the box set. Kubrick knew that this film couldn't stand up to other films in this genre which is why he called it a failure-He believed at the time he was filming it that this was going to be his ""Gone With the Wind"" sweeping epic that would be endured for all times - and it never became that). This film also has one of the most unusual music scores I ever heard,the only way to describe the music in this film is wierd.But If you really liked this film you need to See ""Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe Series,"" any of the A&E ""Horatio Hornblower"" movies or ""The Patriot""(Starring Mel Gibson)because after seeing truely great movies like those, you will soon forget about Barry Lyndon. I will give it 3 out of 5 stars -Its still a much underated good movie",Barry Lyndon
160,JoeKulik,Main Characters Give Us A Mannequin Act !!!,4,9 August 2015,"Stanley Kubrick's screenplay adaptation and direction of Thackeray's Barry Lyndon (1975) is VERY POOR, in my opinion.The two main characters, Barry Lyndon and Lady Lyndon are portrayed as deadpan through the whole film. This is particularly weird for the Barry character since his life story, the topic of the film, undergoes great transformations from start to finish. Yet, Ryan O'Neal, as Barry, looks like a lifeless, emotionless mannequin just reciting his script lines for almost the entire film. Marissa Berenson, as Lady Lyndon, is also a lifeless, emotionless mannequin just reciting script lines, although she is portrayed as being seduced by Barry while still being married to her elderly husband, although the narrator says that she falls in love with Barry before her husband suddenly dies, and although Barry is blowing her fortune and openly cheating in front of her after their marriage. It is true that the film is set in 18th Century England, when we would expect ""propriety and decorum"" to dominate more than today, but the flat, emotionless portrayal of the two main characters in such a tumultuous storyline is just unreal and just indicates a VERY POOR directing job by Stanley Kubrick.I was even more amazed when I read a Wikipedia summary of William Thackeray's The Luck Of Barry Lyndon (1844). In the original novel, Thackeray definitely sets up Barry Lyndon as a hot tempered young man at the start of the novel, using this as his motivation for his duel over his cousin Nora. In the novel, Barry is not the victim of highway robbers, but makes it all the way to Dublin, where he immediately begins hanging around with low lifes and accrues so much gambling debt that he joins the British Army just to escape. Wiki says Barry seduces and bullies Lady Lyndon into marrying him. The novel not only has Barry's stepson Lord Bullington join the British Army to fight in the American Revolution, but has Barry plotting long distance to have Lord Bullington deliberately killed in battle in America.Although I'm the first to say that an auteur should have the creative freedom to revise a screen adaptation of a novel however much he wants, it is VERY STRANGE to me that Kubrick BOTH revised the storyline of the original novel and focused his direction of the main characters in a way that turned his main characters into such lifeless, emotionless, script reciting mannequins. What kills me is that Wiki's plot summary of the novel reveals Barry Lyndon to be a truly colorful and adventuresome guy, a character who already would be a wonderful film character. So what the hell was Kubrick thinking here?? I don't know, but he FAILED BADLY as far as I'm concerned.The elaborate and obviously expensive costumes, period settings, and period accessories such as the horse drawn coaches in this film make it even more puzzling to me what Kubrick was thinking in his production of this film, that is, if he was thinking at all. In any case, elaborate and obviously expensive costumes, period settings, and period accessories do not compensate for a POOR screen adaptation of a novel, and for POOR direction, and that's all I can see in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1972).Anyone who thinks that this is a great film must first start with the assumption that Kubrick is a great filmmaker and then work his way backward from that assumption to justify the ""greatness"" of this film. I just don't see it any other way.",Barry Lyndon
161,tstudstrup,"I've had more fun, starring into a wall.",1,2 February 2017,"This is not a masterpiece. It's not even a good movie. A poor man's Heath Ledger plays Redmond Barry. A man who falls in love with his cousin and has an incestuous relationship with her. Evidently this was okay in those times. When she accept another mans proposal, Barry challenges that man to a duel and kills him. Or so he thinks. He flees to avoid being arrested and is soon enrolled in the British army, later the German army. And then he becomes a spy and later a gambler. He goes after another mans wife and marries her, treats her like crap, impregnates her and cheats on her. He abuses her son and adores his own son. More boring crap happens and Barry ends up childless and with one leg. For reasons unknown he is paid off to leave England by his wife's son. Sounds like a lot is happening, but really nothing happens. Because Barry is such a bastard, I don't give a rats ass, how it ends for him. If you're allergic to men with white powder, rouge and lipstick on their faces and wearing ridiculous wigs and acting like women, avoid this crap. Nothing ever really happens in this snooze fest from no other than Stanley Kubrick. And whenever nothing happens, an annoying soundtrack starts playing very loud that has nothing top do with what happens on the screen. Maybe Kubrick thought it would wake up his bored audience. And the narrator explaining everything makes the movie even more boring, which you would'nt think was possible. The main character Barry is basically an idiot, a sexist and an a-hole and not the least likable. The guy screws his own cousin and ""kills"" a man that she chooses, out of jealousy. He lies and cheats to get what he wants. And in spite of his experience and growing older Barry never evolves as a character or learn from his mistakes. It has generally bad acting, especially from it's star RyanO' Neil. He can't even get his accent right. He is American in real life but plays an Irish man. Later in the movie he speaks with an American accent. Pointless scenes that could have easily been cut out drags on and on. What little action there is, is badly made and completely ridiculous. Like the British army walking in a straight line towards a french army only to be shot at. Yet they never take cover or run towards the enemy or shoot back. They just keep walking into bullets and are killed fast. The complete lack of blood except in a ridiculous fist fight scene, makes the action scenes, even more dull and even less believable. With a budget of 11 million dollars in 1975 and making only 20 million dollars, the movie, well deserved, bombed at the box office and prevented Kubrick from making a movie about Napoleon. This is even worse than the awful A Clockwork Orange.Avoid this like the plague.",Barry Lyndon
162,tjsdshpnd,Kubrick Loyalists will love it,8,20 October 2009,"Director : Stanley Kubrick Cast : Ryan O'Neil, Marisa Berenson, Patrick MageeStanley Kubrick is my favorite director and Barry Lyndon is one of his least recognized films. The reason for it's less popularity is that the movie is very much unlike Kubrick. We get to see a different Kubrick style in this movie, and I am not complaining. To begin with, the movie is set in the 17th Century and requires costumes, sets and mannerisms of that era. Kubrick being the perfectionist he is, has taken care of every minute detail. The movie is about an Irish guy named Redmond Barry and his rags to riches and back to rags story. The central character of Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon is a very complex character to say the least. Kubrick has explored almost all human emotions from pride, lust, love to anger, hate, betrayal, jealousy and power. Kubrick plays with the viewer in the sense that at one instance the viewer feels for Barry Lyndon and at the other instance hates him to the core. In short, the character has too many layers and inner shades, the viewer gets to explore in the course of the movie. Along with all this, Kubrick does not forget the satire he is so frequently associated with. The satirical comments are on that era and made via a narrator who narrates for the entire course of the movie. The technical aspects of the movie are brilliant. Great Cinematography which is a feature of all Kubrick movies is seen here as well. According to me, this movie has the best cinematography than all other Kubrick movies. In short, Kubrick brings 17th century United Kingdom alive on the screen.About the acting, the lead role played by Ryan O'Neil is average to say the least. I personally felt, some other actor would have taken this movie to even greater heights. Kubrick fans will love this movie and enjoy every frame of it. Others might find the 3 hour ordeal as boring and a waste of time. Thus, I will not openly recommend it. Rating : 8/10",Barry Lyndon
163,arturmachado-29588,The rise and fall of Redmond Barry,8,18 August 2017,"In the XVIII century Ireland, Redmond Barry is a young man in love with his cousin, who is promised to an English Captain. Barry challenges him to a pistol duel and wins, being forced to flee to Dublin. On the road, he is robbed and, without further alternative, enlists in the English army to fight in the Seven Years War. When his protector in the army dies, he decides to desert, only to be discovered and forced to join the ranks of the Prussian army, where he saves the life of his captain thus gaining his trust and being assigned to spy on an Irish player. Immediately the two compatriots create a bond of friendship and become associates in the art of the game, embezzling many nobles throughout several courts of Europe. Eventually Barry meets and marries the beautiful and wealthy Lady Lyndon, finally achieving his desired entrance into high society. With his new wealth and name, they move to England where he begins to squander the acquired fortune and thus creating an enemy for life in his stepson. When his son with Lady Lyndon dies at an early age, Barry is devastated, and his stepson sees the perfect opportunity to execute his revenge... through a pistol duel. Barry loses and is forced to renounce his title of Lord, and so the movie ends with the following legend: ""It was in the reign of Jorge III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor they are all equal now"".This is a masterpiece that encompasses all the arts: it is a book on film accompanied by a classical style soundtrack that complements in unison this beautiful drama about the rise and fall of an ambitious man, accomplished in such a way by the master Stanley Kubrick with primordial cinematography that seems more like pictures or paintings in movement, slowly unfolding for the three hours of its duration, and even though the action is also slow and sparse, so much the better for the viewer to appreciate the fine details of the sceneries, clothing, architecture, the incidence of light in the environment, the mannerisms and contrasts of XVIII century people, and the classical music that so well accompanies the progress of the narrative. A very well done movie like few. Not only is it an excellent cinematographic work, it is also an excellent analysis of the human and social condition.Winner of 4 Oscars: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction / Decoration, Best Wardrobe and Best Music, including 3 other Nominations.",Barry Lyndon

165,thesouthfamily2-552-707097,I have now come to claim that satisfaction,9,22 March 2014,"Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" is one of the great dramas of the twentieth century; it is clearly the master's most under-appreciated work.The seemingly irregular tale of Barry Lyndon is quite simple. The film tells the story of the life of Redmond Barry, a poor Irish rogue that, through a mixture of deceit and chance, manipulates his way into the highest reaches of the British Aristocracy in the late 18th Century. The time-frame is between The Seven Years War and the French and American Revolutions. The three-hour long picture is broken down into two parts, making the movie appropriate for multiple-night viewing.The screenplay by Kubrick, based on the novel ""The Luck of Barry Lyndon"" by William Makepeace Thackeray, uses an unreliable narrator to tell the story objectively. This is an intentional, creative choice by Kubrick; the novel itself was told in the first person. Kubrick does this so that the narrator (Michael Hordern) can exist outside of space and time. The narrator knows the entire story before telling it, and gives the audience hints on what is to come. Much of the satire in the picture comes from the narrator's musings. Furthermore, one could argue that the narrator is the most human and relatable character is all of ""Barry Lyndon"".There is no denying that Barry Lyndon is one of the most beautifully photographed motion pictures ever created. Each scene is basically a painting in its own right. Kubrick wants us to take in the scenic beauty of each shot. When viewing Barry Lyndon one feels as if they are traveling through the Romanticism section of an art museum.More impressive than the outdoor shots were the indoor shots. Kubrick had to create a specific camera that would allow filming to be done without any artificial light- creating the ability to shoot entire sequences in candlelight. Any photographer will tell you that lighting is everything in staging a shot- and the fact that Kubrick was able to shoot entire sequences in nothing but candlelit is nothing short of a major technological milestone. Specific lenses were purchased from NASA to shoot the candlelit scenes- the same types of lenses that were used in the filming of the Apollo 11 space landing. He is truly representing what living in the time period would look like.In the end, I think Kubrick is trying to show us the futility of greed- it is this that Barry Lyndon creates a universal message. The vanity of the 18th century is still alive in well, and the story could be that of a stockbroker, imperialist, actor, womanizer, prostitute, terrorist, or President. In the end, everyone is equal. This is a human tale. One can learn a great deal by listening to the tale of Redmond Barry, who once was Barry Lyndon.",Barry Lyndon
166,Naoufel_B,A substantial achievement from Kubrick.,10,27 July 2021,"Based on an obscure novel by William Makepeace, Kubrick delivered with elegance the story of the rise and fall of Barry Lyndon. In this great piece we follow the chronicle of the Anglo-Irish Redmond Barry a soldier, gambler, dueller and social climber.Kubrick really manages to make his main character 'Barry' fascinating while it is only an upstart that we will follow in a two parts story, the first before his marriage to Lady Lyndon and the second after, centered around his perpetual desertions, whether it be from the authorities or himself, his rise in society and his downfall. And Kubrick's storytelling techniques and the way he appropriates the narrative made the main character's arc more captivating.Also ""Barry Lyndon"" showed us how the cinematography can elevate a film and complement its storytelling by using fluid camera movements, magnificent visuals and mise en scène. And Kubrick perfectionist as he is, made great use of all these elements to give this film its aesthetic appeal. In Short this great film has many memorable scenes with some very well written dialogues, not to mention a sublime soundtrack with the iconic ""Sarabande"" by Handel.",Barry Lyndon
167,Andreus3000,"Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness.",9,18 August 2019,"Some people find ""Barry Lyndon"" a fascinating, if cold, exercise in masterful filmmaking; others find it a terrific bore. I have little sympathy for the second opinion; how can anyone be bored by such an audacious film? ""Barry Lyndon"" isn't a great entertainment in the usual way, but it's a great example of directorial vision: Kubrick saying he's going to make this material function as an illustration of the way he sees the world.",Barry Lyndon
168,rch427,"Overpraised, poorly-paced and rather a waste",5,6 September 2006,"I hadn't seen (or read) ""Barry Lyndon"" until 31 years after it was released, so I can't presume to be its most receptive and sympathetic audience. However, I am a fan of period film, and count a range of such films from ""Tom Jones"" to ""I, Claudius"" to ""A Cock & Bull Story"" as favorites, so I should have had some affinity for this story. And as I am a fan of Kubrick's mature work, I had high expectations for ""Barry Lyndon"". Alas, my hopes were in vain; I believe it was a wasted opportunity on all counts.It must be said that I had never considered Ryan O'Neal to be a very skilled actor, so his performance here was no surprise to me. The rest of the cast ranged from capable to outstanding (particularly Marisa Berenson and Murray Melvin), at least when they were given a story to work with. Thackeray may have been writing to an audience of two and a quarter centuries ago, but a competent director can breathe life into dusty words. This Kubrick largely failed to do. The pacing ranges between leisurely and glacial. Humorous conversation never sparkles, action never excites. All plods along with a drudgery that one must merely endure until the anticlimactic ending.At first, I expected it to be a story of a man's redemption. Then it seemed like it would settle for being a morality tale. Then even that was compromised until we were left with little more than character studies, sketched for far too long to keep ones interest. The story cried out for some dynamic character, someone with whom we could feel empathy. Instead we were given period sets peopled with hollow characters going through their assigned motions, and inexorably onward to their ends.",Barry Lyndon
169,GHCool,"Interesting, but Long",6,21 December 2001,"Barry Lyndon is a GOOD film.  However it is also an extremely long film, but a very interesting one.  It is my least favorite Stanley Kubrick film, which is saying a lot about the man's career.  This is the only Kubrick film I would not consider a GREAT film, but only a GOOD one.  How many times do you come across a filmmaker who's movies are so good that the worst you could say about your least favorite one of his movies is that it is ""GOOD?""I definitely would have cut a few scenes if I had directed it, but I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in European history.One word of advice: the movie is broken up into two parts and divided by an intermission.  I suggest you watch the first part one day and the second part the next day.  That's what I did and I think I enjoyed it more because of it.Second word of advice: my mother bought me the Stanley Kubrick Collection on DVD for my birthday.  I had not seen the movie before my mom bought the DVD for me.  I was not very impressed with the DVD.  It doesn't have any special features except French, widescreen, and a rather lame trailer and the quality wasn't up to par with the other DVDs in the collection.  Until they make a better DVD, I suggest renting a widescreen VHS copy.  Its cheaper that way.",Barry Lyndon
170,antonjsw1,A cold but beautiful work of art,10,6 June 2010,"While not for all tastes, this is an excellent filmIt has been filmed as if each individual frame of film is a painting.The story is archetypal but interesting, telling the story of the rise and fall of an anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal in the title role is a real surprise and is engaging despite being a character that is deliberately dislike-able. In fact as the character rises up the social ladder, with setbacks on the way, I began to sympathise with the character more. When the character makes it, the film then shifts to be a study of hubris and the character becomes deliberately dislike-able again. Even when the character undertakes a surprising redemptive turn, it is appropriate, and perhaps inevitable that the character becomes subject to the very type the act that he would be more than happy to meat out to other individuals, and certainly does to his stepson, played well by Leon Vitali as his older form, but absolutely brilliantly by in the younger form by child actor, now TV director Dominic Savage. The young Bullingdon comes across as more mature than some of the adult characters that surround him. Other performances are all good and appropriate for the story. Kubrick again makes use of performers he has worked with before, notably Philip Stone as the Lyndon's family lawyer, Leonard Rossiter and the cowardly Captain Quinn, Anthony Sharpe as Lord Hallam, and and excellent Godfrey Quigley as Captain Grogan, the only character with genuine warmth and integrity in the story.The plot progresses at a steady pace. As a viewer, you have to be patient to be rewarded by it. Less patient viewers will see it as boring but then Kubrick as a director expects you to be patient. He was patient with actors in his films, as evidenced by very long shooting schedules and working with actors not to rush when planning their performances; he was patient putting his films together is post production. He therefore expects audiences to be patient. The story is in effect a series of rises and falls of fortune, culminating in a fall at the end of the film. In fact, this major fall is the character's own making, and I did feel frustrated that the character started making a series of wrong choices, not helped by the hubristic attitude of Lyndon's mother, who is well played by Irish actor Marie Kean. Therefore, it was clear that the film had succeeded in drawing me in despite the objective, observational style of the film, with an effective narration by Michael Hordern.Technical credits are outstanding, which is typical for Kubrick films of this period. John Alcott's photography gives great realism to the period, lighting scenes to suggest natural light sources, rather than more typical feature film compositional lighting. Camera-work is more subtle than in previous Kubrick films. However, Kubrick does make very effective use of slow zooms to help tell the story. It is no surprise that Alcott won an Oscar for his work. Design by Ken Adam (as production designer), Roy Walker(as art director), Vernon Dixon (as set dresser) frequent Kubrick collaborator and 3 time Oscar winner Milena Canonero(costumes), and Ulla-Britt Söderlund (costumes) is nothing short of brilliant and totally convinces you of the time period the film takes place in. They all deservedly won Oscars. Composer Leonard Rosenmann also won an academy award for his excellent work adapting existing classical pieces, but huge credit has to go to Kubrick for his choices, that totally suit the film.Kubrick marshals everything with his usual panache. While the film is a tragedy, the few action scenes, which hinge around Napleonic type warfare with muskets, is brilliantly executed, but doesn't come across as the director showing off, but as being entirely integrated into the story. Be patient, open minded and you'll throughly enjoy it.",Barry Lyndon
171,RichardKleiner,A different Stanley Kubrick film,10,16 September 2008,"I have to declare I wasn't a fan of Stanley Kubrick. His movies weren't the type I could watch over and over again and enjoy. He was always set on adding stuff you would feel rather uncomfortable to watch.Still, I have been rediscovering Stanley Kubrick, and Barry Lyndon was one of the movies I missed before.The visual style of the movie is stunning. There are great landscapes in almost every single shot, and, because it's slow pacing, most of these shots seem like actual, beautiful, paintings. The wardrobe and make-up is quite accurate, although, since you are not so accustomed to the fashion of the time, you might find some of the extravagant hair-dos and heavily powdered faces rather laughable.The story itself surprised me. Even though most of what happens is extremely simple, I was left hooked. As I am very fond with venturing and traveling to the unknown, I felt rather excited. I'm not sure if this is was Kubrick intended, but my sympathy for Barry slowly disappeared, as he was shown more and more as an opportunist, concerned with his own status than with his own wife.Although the narrator was an informative resort, I felt it was spoiling much of the surprises, which also happened with the titling of each respective part.Most of the performances were above excellent. All of the actors understand the posture and gestures one had to have while living in that time, and so, most dialogs may sound minimal. I personally would have enjoyed more small talk between characters, but the movie was more governed by style and setting.As for the music, although very repetitive, the selections do fit the scenes good. Of course, Haendel's Sarabande heard here is beautiful and tragic at the same time. Unfortunately, you hear it far too many times.Kubrick's style is present in the movie, but I think it arrives a little late, after the first 30 minutes. For the opening scenes, I didn't feel I was watching a Stanley Kubrick movie. It was as if the first scenes were inspired by classical paintings and so, they had look like them as much as possible. Still, the long shot with a character in the center does eventually appear, and it doesn't break the whole style of the movie.I warn that, like most of Kubrick's films, you can't watch it with your friends or with the whole family. But this time it isn't because it's has strong graphic material or harsh language. It's more for how dense this movie really is. Every minute is heavy with emotion, visual elements, music, and extreme slowness. But it still had me hooked, as I wanted to find out what happened next, and that, along with Lady Lyndon's characterization and visual representation, is what makes it one of my favorite Stanley Kubrick films. I wouldn't call it a ""must-see"", but it's not a bad pick if you wan't to rent it (although it would help if you watch with full attention).",Barry Lyndon
172,cwarne_uk,Monumental Bore-athon By Terminally Overrated Director,3,7 August 2008,"Is Stanley Kubrick the most overrated filmmaker ever? He certainly had prodigious technical gifts, ""Barry Lyndon"" may not be be the best looking film ever but it certainly comes close, stunning at times in it's use of natural light. He acted like an artist, slow-working and perfectionist. He was certainly uncompromising. In short Kubrick looked and acted like a genius, luckily for him in the world of cinema this was enough to get him proclaimed a genius. All of his films were met by gushing reviews - witness the response to the execrable ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Yet any true critical response to his films should attempt to explain the utter emptiness of his post ""Dr Strangelove"" work. ""Barry Lyndon"" is important here because for all its beauty this is as vapid as film gets. Kubrick drains all life out of characters, the wit and irony of Thackeray totally lost. Ryan O'Neal shows that TV support roles are his natural home (Paper Moon is the only film he didn't ruin), and the rest of the cast are forgettable. Kubrick is art-cinema for those who are scared of real art - it challenges one after all, he is great cinema for those who believe that great cinema consists of nice looking pictures. He is intellectual cinema for the simple minded. There is more life and art in 10 minutes of a Jason Statham film than in this bore. So yes I believe he is overrated and this piece of dross is first exhibit in the case.",Barry Lyndon
173,citizenchris,there is no greater implementation of the myriad components that make great cinema than this marvelous film,9,24 September 2008,"Barry Lyndon 9-24-08Here we have yet another film whose narrative is concerned with a central character who by all accounts is an a$$...and I couldn't love it more. Why these sorts of movies fascinate me is simple. Stories about ""good"" men or ""bad"" men are easy to tell, often times entertaining (whatever that means) and quite frequent. I find that in reality men are seldom either of these extremes to the exclusion of the other. I find films that depict characters as such to be more authentic and to my way of thinking much more compelling. Suffice to say the titular protagonist (who is arguably also the antagonist as well) is just such a character. With each subsequent viewing of Barry Lyndon I become more convinced that there is no greater implementation of the myriad components that make great cinema than this marvelous film. In nearly every respect this is a marvelous film. The cinematography is breath taking. Scenes appear to have been lit naturally...as this is a period film I find this to be quite a wonderful stroke of authenticity.",Barry Lyndon
174,hamlet-16,Truly stunning ....,10,19 July 2000,"Barry Lyndon, which I recently saw for the first time in nearly twenty years, remains one of the most extraordinary films I have ever seen.I clearly remember seeing the film on it release and being quite literally overwhelmed.No other film distills Kubrick's visual and directorial style so completely as Barry Lyndon.Much of the film's brilliance lies in the stunning cinematography, which is not only a technical tour-de-force but also captures some of the most beautiful images ever created for film.And few films have so successfully combined music and image, even though the soundtrack is in mono. (It proves all the modern multichannel wizardry is of no use if thought behind a film's sound scheme is lacking).The much discussed central performance by Ryan O'Neal is in fact almost flawless. O'Neal's Lyndon remains a cypher and in some ways distant from the viewer but irresistible at the same time, buffeted by fate and the consequences of his own failings.Indeed all the performances, from Sir Micheal Hordern, who narrates the film and the rest of the cast are excellent.Whilst the story is episodic and the plot straightforward it serves as the essential backdrop for both Thackeray and Kubrick's biting wit.It also contains some of the most trenchant anti-war sentiment you are likely to hear.This is a great film.",Barry Lyndon
175,Raptorclaw155,The Story of a Strange Diversion Taken in the Life of One Redmond Barry,9,6 June 2020,"Barry Lyndon is a film that doesn't follow the life of Redmond Barry but a years-long diversion his life takes which is catalyzed by a, seemingly, unimportant quarrel which leads to major consequences.With this film, Kubrick managed to bring to life a 19th century novel in the best possible way. From the narration, the way the characters behave, the costumes, the soundtrack, and even the use of natural, non-electric lighting make this film feel incredibly authentic.Barry Lyndon thrusts the viewer into this world as you follow Redmond through his life adventures going from a naive Irish farm boy to returning a more broken man. Films like this make for great cinema as following the lives of people and how small instances of something happening can lead to much bigger things later on.This is a character driven story, and as a result some might not find it particularly interesting seeing as how there's no real plot to speak of in the same many might be used to. Redmond is living his life and, in the course of his life and his decisions, things happen as a consequence of them, and thus the story feeds itself. The film doesn't really have so much a conclusion as it simply ends, but since it only follows a particular period of this character's life, ending it any other way aside from with his death, would ruin the feeling of authenticity.This film probably isn't for everybody, especially for those who are more accustomed to plot-driven films. But just like with an old, 19th century novel, if one is willing to remove themselves from what they expect and go in and take this film for what it is one might find what makes this film so fascinating. It's not like Kubrick's other works, but it's still a great piece by him either way.",Barry Lyndon
176,Cheetah-6,"Stunning, Mesmerizing and Not Without Some Good Laughs.",10,28 September 2005,"Barry Lyndon is as great a film as so many say it is. It truly does transport one to another place and time with a sense of authenticity. I too was completely taken in with Barry's story and the eloquent way in which Kubrick presented it and allowed it to unfold. It's remarkable how time slips by unnoticeably while watching this film despite its 3 hour length and deliberate slow pace. What also struck me about it which I've not seen others comment on is the sense of humor that this film evokes about many of Barry's fortunes and ironic twists that it takes. I feel it evident in everything from the opening and ending statements displayed on the screen to the dry droll of the narrators voice along side some pretty comical situations Barry finds himself in. The dueling scenes, the style in which battles were fought, the narrator explaining how Barry's lonely German Frau took many passing lovers into her cabin during the course of the war as he rides off into the misty morning after their romantic liaison. The base human desires, not so noble emotions and flaws that arise in the characters often bring a wry smile to the proceedings. This sense is especially strong in the first half, after the intermission when things become quite dire for Barry I felt less of this comical undercurrent or only in a much darker shade. Whether one senses an undercurrent humor to all of this or not, it is a stunning memorable film and easily one of the top 100 of all time.",Barry Lyndon
177,andrew7,Overlooked Gem,9,5 February 2002,"When you think of Kubrick, what do you think of?  Strangelove?  Clockwork? Shining?  If you are like most people, you don't think about Lyndon.  That's a shame.  Because it is every bit as magnificent, splendid, and powerful as anything else in his canon.  The true genius of Kubrick, according to Spielberg, is that he never made the same film twice.  Because of this, comparing one Kubrick film to another is a tricky situation.  It also means that, for just about everyone, there is going to be a Kubrick film that just doesn't do it for you.  [If there's such a one for me, I haven't found it yet.]  Kubrick didn't make very many films, all things considered, but he managed a breadth most directors will never reach.  ""Barry Lyndon"" is Kubrick's foray into the costume drama.  It is the most realistic such film I've ever seen.  I don't mean that the story, plot, or characters are realistic (certainly they are, but there are loads of costume dramas realistic in that sense), but the cinematography, through Kubrick's innovative use of light and specially constructed lenses, makes this film look utterly remarkable.  I really feel as if I'm watching things that are actually happening.Ken Adam did the production design on this film (as he had done on ""Dr Strangelove""), and once again he scores a triumphant victory.  Also the costumes, the locations.  Every visual element of the film is a remarkable achievement, and would make this film worthy of the highest praise. 
So why has the film become such a curiosity?  Why are otherwise film-literate people, who are intimately familiar with many of Kubrick's other films, totally unaware of ""Barry Lyndon""?  Apparently, the story isn't very good.  Well, that's what I gather from reading the other reviews here. The story isn't very good.  It's boring and too long. 
Too long.  Of all the things anyone has ever said about a film, ""too long"" annoys me the most.  As if length were a primary characteristic of a film. It's not.  Length is simply of function of what the director has chosen to include in the film, and the pace.  Certainly, ""Barry Lyndon"" has a very slow pace.  But I consider this a strength.  Like ""2001"", ""Barry Lyndon"" tells its story through a very different narrative approach.  The basic story is extremely simple.  If you read a transcript of the narration and dialogue, you would see the simple, skeletal framework of the plot.  And for a 3 hour film, it is a very thin framework.  But because the pace is so slow, Kubrick enables the actors to convey a far more complicated palette of emotions than the thin story would otherwise allow, and they convey these emotions through  superb subtlety.  A long look, and pensive sigh...  A ten second shot of Lady Lyndon with Lord Bullingdon in her arms, perfectly still, unchanging expression.  These shots, these ""long"", ""boring"", ""pointless"", shots reveal so much more about the story and the characters than our hypothetical transcript ever could.  But why choose such a way as that to reveal the full depths of the story? Because Kubrick was a film-maker.  Any given story can be told in any number of ways.  As Kubrick was telling this particular story (one which had already been told in novel form) in cinematic form, he chose to rely, in so far as possible, on purely cinematic tools.  Dialogue is common to film, radio, and prose.  But the effect of that glorious shot of Lady Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, which is only one of so many beautifully composed shots dripping with emotion, could not have been communicated in any other medium. That is why Kubrick is such a great filmmaker.  He understood the unique tool he had in the medium of film and he shared its power.  He stripped this film of as much as he could that is not unique to film, and left us with a glimpse at what film, and only film, is capable of bringing to the art of narrative fiction.  Also, the film has a wonderfully dry, ironic wit which is all too often overlooked.",Barry Lyndon
178,AdFin,"As with all Kubrick movies we're dealing with a cold, detached story of a man searching for his own identity.",10,2 March 2002,"Very much a film of two halves, the first chronicling the rise of Redmond Barry, and the second dealing with the fall of the now appointed Barry Lyndon.  This is a similar structure device applied by Kubrick, notably in A Clockwork Orange and later in Full Metal Jacket, both of which depicted the long development process of an individual at odds with his society and surroundings.  The parallels between Barry, Alex and Private Joker are staggering, from the cynicism and underhanded intelligence, they each, somehow manipulated their way from common rogue, to a character with reasonable standing within the structural society of the film. 
The second Act is by far the strongest part of the film, because it is by this stage that we begin to feel empathy for Barry, but it is also the part of the film, which differs greatly from those other Kubrick masterpieces. For example, A Clockwork Orange showed our hero return to his murderous ways, cured by the state that originally imprisoned him for his crimes, whereas Full Metal Jacket showed the platoon soldier on, in both instances we got the impression that the film may be over for us but the characters had a long way to go.  This isn't the case with Barry Lyndon.  Although it may be argued that Barry's ""luck of the Irish"" lifestyle may still have some excitement left in it, there is the feeling that we have all ready been privy to the best part, that no matter what happens next for him will not reach the same unbelievable fortune and misfortune that has followed him through the course of the film. Kubrick plays with notions of loyalty, love, power, deceit, war, honesty and nobility with Barry Lyndon, never allowing the film to flag or become tiresome.  As much a film of technicality as it is performance (as with all Kubrick), it was to be the film that would set the visual staple for subsequent period films The Dualists, Dangerous Liaisons and Amadeus. Kubrick's approach to filming in Barry Lyndon is like filming renaissance paintings, employing the long zoom in's/zoom out's to show us the necessary information, never merely cutting away to an object.  This is so rare nowadays, with cuts in films getting quicker and quicker, Kubrick manages to condense everything of importance of those times (fashion, architecture, music) and fill every corner of the frame, and the recurring theme of Handel's Sarabande is hauntingly evocative. The performances are strong, given Kubrick's standing as a visual film-maker, with Ryan O' Neil giving a fine performance, along with Leonard Rossiter, Patrick Magee, Marisa Berenson, and Leon Vitali ensures that acting is of the same calibre as the cinematography, and O' Neil giving the standout of his career (even with the accent).  An overwhelmingly beautiful film that should rank amongst Kubrick's greatest, which has somewhere along the lines been sadly forgotten.  With a deep emotion and wonderful moments, Kubrick's film version of Barry Lyndon has that rare power to restore the love of film-making to any jaded film fan.  10/10",Barry Lyndon

182,longcooljolie,Unbelievably beautiful cinematic experience,10,3 April 2013,"Barry Lyndon is considered a middling success, in terms of how well it was received when it was initially released (critically and by the public), how well it stacks against other Stanley Kubrick movies and how well it did at the box office.For me it is a glorious, 3+ hour sensory treat. The Sundance channel played it Easter morning and ran only two commercial breaks.Stanley Kubrick excels at creating stunning, unforgettable visuals. Some of the most famous are Slim Pickens riding a nuclear warhead, James Mason casually painting Sue Lyon's toenails (Lolita), the astronaut dismantling HAL, floating over a circuit pad and making the computer progressively dumber and dumber, until it starts singing ""Daisy,"" Alec and his droogs in ""A Clockwork Orange"", and the sergeant berating a recruit in ""Full Metal Jacket."" So what is the stunning, unforgettable visual in Barry Lyndon? Practically the whole movie! Mr. Kubrick set out to create a cinematic experience out of the Gainsborough paintings of the 18th century. Several scenes in Barry Lyndon are filmed in candlelight, which creates an ethereal experience.Was there any woman as beautiful in any movie as Marisa Berenson was as Lady Lyndon in Barry Lyndon? Granted, she had help from Stanley Kubrick's direction, but could any actress of today have embodied this role as well? Doubtful. Ryan O'Neal excelled in the title role, as well.Winner of four well-deserved Oscars for set design, cinematography, musical score and costumes. See it!",Barry Lyndon

184,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 48,8,2 January 1999,"48. BARRY LYNDON. adventure-drama, 1975: Ambitious but naive, Barry (RyanO'Neil) is determined to gain a higher place in 17th-century European society. However, his hot-tempered manner gets him into trouble early in life when a loveless romance ends in tragedy. Forced to flee his home, he enlists in the British army. Deserting, he finds success with a shrewd cardsharper that takes him under his wing. At last, having dispelled the notions of love and mastering the disguise of a 'gentleman', he courts the Countess of Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They marry and he inherits her vast wealth, along with great troubles.Critique: Stanley Kubrik's overlong, ambitious epic stopped a run of critical and commercial hits (that started with 'The Killing'(1956). Kubrik's forte has always rested on his thematic storytelling and eccentric camera-work. Though intricately plotted and lavishly produced, the film suffers from these same excesses. The first 'part' of the film is a complete bore, without any of Kubrik's wit and imagination. However, it is considerably lifted when the lovely Marisa Berenson appears as the Countess of Lyndon. Her courting scene is one of the most hypnotic, expertly filmed sequences in cinema history. The rest of the performances are adequate at best, and Kubrik's vision is still wonderful to watch. The music (as in every Kubrik film) is beautifully resonant. The film's slow pace and artistic excesses by Kubrick, makes it not for all tastes.QUOTES: Narrator: ""The doctors were called.

186,Phillim212,"oohs and aahs -- but no, uh, arc",5,29 November 2017,"A dead movie, like a dead language, can be an aggregate of exquisite details.'Barry Lyndon' is two movies with an intermission: 100 minutes to show the rise of an ambitious Georgian-era social-climbing Irish ruffian; 80 minutes to show his fall. The rise comprises his hard-scrabble youth and treacherous usurpation of aristocratic English privilege, the fall his comeuppance via the revenge of those he wronged.Nobody's sympathetic. Everybody's a scoundrel, a shallow heir or heiress, a toady, a soldier reduced to brutality by brutal treatment.A dead movie, like a dead body, can be exquisitely dressed, painted, and presented.Achingly beautiful images, unbelievable luminescence scene to scene. Life in the 18th century according to Kubrick was endless dullness in lovely landscapes, punctuated by war, duels, births and deaths, financial ruin, sociopolitical intrigue – and the occasional raging outburst. Kubrick breaks it down – every context for every upset of mundane life two hundred years past is painstakingly laid out. Nothing is a surprise. To be fair, Kubrick uses Brechtian title cards for each section, telling us this is what he intends to show us. But even Brecht made us feel for his protagonists, intended audience alienation effect notwithstanding. And Brecht astonished and surprised us. Kubrick gives these people something like a dry, old-school National Geographic anthropologic treatment – no small feat – but is it sustainable as a narrative film? One senses Kubrick was trying to give the audience a mimetic experience – the snail's pace and anti-dramatic structure of the film intended to let us live in the 18th-century for a few hours. It is a noble experiment . . . but it fails. It is impossible to engage with this film for very long.This viewer has not read the source novel by William Makepeace Thackery, but is highly doubtful the characters, or narrative point of view, lack a scintilla of wit – as is the case with Kubrick's film. No bawdy jokes, no farcical situations, no banter or games to see anybody through drudgery and war. Anybody living the life presented here would quickly die of despair or their own hand. I can understand not wanting to replicate, say, the rowdy romp of 'Tom Jones', but it is a mistake to direct actors to confuse a character's shallow exterior for a lack of inner life, or similarly exploit nonactors or actors of little depth -- that cultural pretense leads to amateur acting is hardly an original concept worth three hours beating over the head. No spontaneity here, no idiosyncrasy, no shared ensemble energy as a means to exponential discovery. It's as if Kubrick were trying so hard to avoid acting clichés – or was so cynical about the craft of acting – that he allowed no acting whatsoever; in other words, he attempted to perpetrate a grievous fraud: presenting the supremely titanic artifice of a commercial motion picture sans the artifice of accomplished acting technique.The title character is Ryan O'Neal, a huge American star in 1975 when this film was made. Sexy, earnest, milk-fed boy next door of limited range, used well in light romantic comedies. Kubrick casts O'Neal as something of a cypher, showing little to no emotional stake in the events of his character's life – but capable of great rage when provoked by an attack on his dignity. Otherwise there is no passion in the man.Marissa Berensen as the aristocrat Lyndon targets and snags is a striking fashion model, giving a striking fashion model's performance: the light, the camera love her to death. But a work of art should demystify a character such as hers. This film tells us she barely exists beneath the skin, yet continually thrusts her at us without revealing any information – to the point of annoyance. As with Berensen, Kubrick's use of O'Neil mystifies his character: we must accept that he is the archetypal social climber – and, for lack of much substantial information in the film, define him by preconceptions. Both are like cartoon or sitcom characters who go through dire situations yet barely register their effects. This makes for repetition, frustration, and, ultimately giving up on the film altogether.Kubrick's tight rein on lightweight O'Neal and novice Berensen is palpable, his artistic gun at their head barely outside the frame. The only actors allowed any room to play are Leonard Rossiter as a pompous military officer/jilted suitor, Patrick Magee as a high-stakes con artist all silk brocade and garish make-up over the small pox scars, and Murray Melvin's prissy tutor-priest. Rossiter was Kubrick's wonderfully sketchy Russian Ambassador in '2001: A Space Odyssey', Magee was Alex's obsessive main tormentor in 'A Clockwork Orange'. Melvin here is playing to type: he had a nice career interpreting crypto- and not-so-crypto gays through the 1960s and 70s (see 'The Devils' and 'A Taste of Honey').The movie won numerous awards for design, costumes, cinematography – and rightly so. Breathtaking visuals. Innovative technology allowed illumination of several scenes by candles alone. The early war sequences are consistent with Kubrick's career-long critique of that institution, and provide something of an apologia for a creature like O'Neil's protagonist, who decides marrying great wealth is the only antidote to a soldier's rotten life. That great wealth and its possessors only exist by perpetuating continual war is a strong theme of the film not lost on this viewer.'Barry Lyndon' is a work worth seeing because it is by a master, and it it is an odd creature indeed. It contains genius. But it is auteurism run amok.",Barry Lyndon
187,batzi8m1,Bildingsroman - The development of Character,10,9 September 2005,"I was sitting drinking with a friend one night talking about movies, art and literature after a Werner Herzog Q&A following the premiere of his ""Little Dieter wants to Fly"" at the Roxie when the topic of Stanley Kubrik came up. We both instantly agreed he belongs in the pantheon of the movie gods.""What's your favorite Kubrik movie"" he asked.""I know all the Kubrik fans and the critics hated it, but for me it's Barry Lyndon hands down."" I replied.Long story slightly shortened, he agreed wholeheartedly and pulled out a copy from his shelf saying, ""It's the only one I own."" Most people are Kubrik fans for the spectacle of the extreme from films like Clockwork Orange and 2001 - brilliant in their own right - but never get beyond that to the essence of Kubrik - Character Development. Yeah I know, it's the bla bla bla the critics whine about being missing all the time, but that's what makes a movie, not the exploding cars.Barry Lyndon is all about the development of the character of a country Casanova becoming a lord and how his times shaped his character, much in the same way Clockwork Orange is about how language shapes our character.The Bildungsroman - or Character Development Novel - is most often cited as a German development attributed to Goethe and supposedly culminating with Thomas Mann, but the focus on the development of regular people was the major theme of 19th Century European Literature from Stendahlto Dostoyevsky all the way back as far as I can trace it to Shakespeare, Homer or the stories of Cuchullain - and most certainly Thackery and his contemporaries from Charles Dickens to Jane Austin.From Path's to Glory, Spartacus, on to the his last Kubrik is all about character -- even 2001 is strictly focused on the development of human character from the screeching ape to the dying aristocrat in his bed. (When even the development of a computer's character is a theme we are really expected to get the picture of what this is all about.) But he took it to the limit with this one, focusing over three hours on character and boring the action junkies, who were still on the Clockwork Orange horrorshow high, to death. But for myself and for many others this one is his greatest masterpieces because of that focus on character development. I would really like to see a previous poster explain what contemporary have film plots less ""thin"" than this.",Barry Lyndon
188,ctrout,Second Best of '75,10,20 June 2004,"Second only to Jaws, Barry Lyndon is the story of an Irish rogue who's determined to get to the top of the social ladder any way he can. He'll lie, cheat, steal, and kill, but he always has time for women. A movie like this seems like it would be for anyone, but the 18th century setting and the three hour running time seem to put everyone off.Well, I'm here to tell you that it's not the movie you think it would be. The poster, which is one of my all time favorites, sums the film up brilliantly. Fighting and loving is what a man does best and that's what life seems to always end up being.Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's greatest film. The Art-Direction and Costumes are spectacular and they both deservedly won Oscars. The director captures that era brilliantly and does it with what seems like such ease. The battlefields are perfect and the everything is done for a reason. Kubrick even waited until the clouds in the sky were just how he wanted them before he started shooting a scene.And it never gets slow at all. Despite the long running time, it will always interest you to find out what Barry will try to do next. Which means that Kubrick has directed it in such a way that it's not like most other long films.The acting by Ryan O'Neal is the best of that year. It's a shame that he wasn't recognized by the Academy for a nomination. He truly deserved one, and not without the help of Kubrick.Stanley Kubrick deserved his long overdue Best Director award that year for the time and effort he put in to creating this masterpiece. It also won Oscars for Cinematography and Adaptation Score. It's one of the best films of the '70s and one of the best films of all time. It's also definitely the best thing Kubrick has ever done.",Barry Lyndon
189,pickle-92642,You'll like this WAY more than you think you will!,9,14 July 2021,"This was a very pleasant surprise ngl. I didn't think I would like this as much as I did, I thought it would be another 8/10 average Kubrick movie that didn't quite live up to my expectations like Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove. But this really was great. The first hour or so was kind of slow for me and I wasn't really into it as much. But soon after that I was completely hooked (and I'm surprised about it as well). Something like this shouldn't have had my undivided attention, but it managed it. I was fully invested, and almost felt like I had traveled back to the late 1700s. The production design was fantastic and captured the vibe perfectly; it's almost as if the movie was truly 250 years old. But damn. The cinematography. Every shot was truly like a painting. Some of the best in any movie I think, probably top 20-30 ever. Bulls*** Oscar snub. One of the most visually stunning movies out there, especially for 1975. This is Kubrick's 4th best movie imo, but the 3 above it are virtually untouchable (ACO, 2001, and Shining). Honestly tho, the story in this film had me completely hooked, and the ending was as intense as ever. One of my only complaints however was that the pacing wasn't too good. Every time it'd felt like an hour I would check how far I was into the movie only to realize that 25 minutes had passed. There were moments that it was a little boring, but sometimes you need that in a movie. I would give this a very respectable score of 8.7/10, and I recommend this to everyone that likes Kubrick (who doesn't really).",Barry Lyndon
190,style-2,Gorgeous film,7,31 January 2005,"Slow as molasses in January, and as sweet, while the camera lingers, soulfully kissing and savoring each moment. With immaculate precision of detail, Kubrick constructs his story of the hapless rogue Lyndon, portrayed by that expert at haplessness, Ryan O'Neal. Being no heavyweight in the acting department (but being cute enough to not have to be), the lengthy script about the rogue's success has been tailored in such a way that it flatters O'Neal's meager abilities. By method of Michael Hordem's sonorous narration, much of what O'Neal has to do is look handsome in his 18th century wardrobe. And that he does. The same is virtually true of co-star Marisa Berenson, who also co-starred in *Cabaret*. She is not an incredibly gifted actress, but she is indeed, an incredibly gifted beauty. So, she, too, must rely on her attractiveness. This is a time-honored Hollywood tradition that still lives and breathes today. If they gave Oscars for being attractive (and they do, don't they, Gwenyth?), this movie would have raked in the awards. It won four, anyway  Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Musical Adaptation. Clocking in at 3 hours and 3 minutes, Kubrick fans are deeply conflicted over whether or not this is a masterpiece.",Barry Lyndon
191,benc7ca,"A Series of Pictures, Each Worth a Thousand Words",9,1 May 2004,"I saw Barry Lyndon when it was first released almost 30 years ago.  I remember thinking ""This would be great if only he had cast someone other than Ryan O'Neil"".  Now, viewing it again, I realize it wouldn't have mattered: the only star of any Kubrick film is Stanley himself and this is the most beautiful film he has ever starred in. Period films usually don't wear well; anachronisms creep in regardless of how meticulous a director is (and most aren't) so that on viewing, years later, one can tell immediately the decade(sometimes, even the year) in which it was made. Barry Lyndon is a notable exception. On a lush, exquisite, cinematic canvas, scene by scene, Kubrick re-creates the mid-18th century in beautiful, painterly detail. The acting, the actors, the plot are all of secondary importance to this visual masterpiece.",Barry Lyndon
192,darioilg,The life of an Irish scoundrel,10,18 January 2017,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a coming-of-age story with the Kubrick touch, so nothing you've ever seen before. It is the story of an Irish boy whose life takes him to roads he'd never think he'd get in, nor does the viewer. Instead of the classic story of growth and overcoming of one's own limits, with ""Barry Lyndon"" Kubrick gives us his customary pessimistic view over the need for control of the human beings over fate or, in other words, the unfathomable number of variables that can change one's life in an instant. Almost comically, the viewer gets used to Barry's continuous shifts from luck to bad fortune in the first half hour, so that the rest of the (long) movie can be played with both the author and the addressee conscious of the rules. The setting in the XVIII century cannot be random: Kubrick alludes to that historic age in almost everyone of his films because it's the purest moment of coexistence of reason and passion, reality and staged society, some of the director's most beloved themes.Kubrick's attention to detail and maniacal perfection in cinematography could even make the movie unbearable for some. Every single shot in three hours of film are blatantly studied and show conceitedly how amazingly the light is used throughout the scenes: most shots are filmed solely with the use of natural light and/or candles, something any other film-maker would've thought utterly impossible (and it would have been, if Kubrick hadn't had the permission to use new lenses produced by NASA!). There is a continuous use of reverse zoom to ""paint"" in front of the audience's eyes pictures which reveal more of the scene as the lens widens. The use of music is also noticeable, with classic tunes employed for superb emotionally resonant editing cuts (I'm thinking about a specific one near the end about Barry's child).""Barry Lyndon"" is where the audience can see how one of Kubrick's greatest talents was to mold his actors into the kind of actors needed for a specific film. In this one, every single character has a certain immobility to him, as if an actual painting was brought to life just as long as it is necessary for the narration. Many scenes are simply frozen, with just one character talking or doing something, and even then the movements are perfectly calibrated and artificial, as if instead of actors Kubrick bought machines for his film. This rule is suddenly broken in moments of rage or pain where the camera becomes shaky and the scene confused too.""Barry Lyndon"" is a fantastic example of Kubrick's maniacal perfection in shooting and between his best works, although not as emotionally or intellectually groundbreaking as his VERY best.",Barry Lyndon
193,kingtanichi,One of the best period pieces I've ever seen,10,6 November 2004,"Far too many period pieces these days look like what they are -- 20th or 21st century actors putting on historical costumes (which may or may not be accurate) and acting out a story with no attempt whatsoever to really get into the mindset of the period in question. I think that exceptions to this rule are becoming more common these days (Master and Commander was very impressive) but only when helmed by especially conscientious and meticulous directors. And no director was ever more conscientious and meticulous than Stanley KubrickWith Barry Lyndon, Kubrick does for the period picture what 2001 did for science fiction, what Dr. Strangelove did for the comedy, and what Spartacus may or may not have done for the costume epic. There's little enough by way of definite plot here, just Ryan O'Neil trying to make his way through life in the 18th century as best he can. It was a period where society's chosen ones could live like gods, and the unlucky could descend to sub-human squalor, and it was perfectly possible to do both in a single lifetime. It was also the Age of Reason, where weakness of nerve or instinct to self-preservation was considered much less important than a gentleman's agreement.It's passed into film legend that no artificial lighting whatsoever was used in filming. This wasn't quite the case -- it was unavoidable for a few scenes -- but Kubrick was hell-bent on minimizing it as much as possible to get the authentic effect of rooms lit all by candlelight. Kubrick's background in still photography was apparent in A Clockwork Orange, but he's taken on a painter's eye here -- logical since 18th century painting offered an entire world of research material.This is, in the end, a very visual film. As such, the level of acting isn't as memorably ingenious as in some of Kubrick's other films. An excellently written narration track and some ingenious text at the climax is needed to really tie everything together. But this movie apparently still gave Ryan O'Neil's career enough of a boost that two years later he ended up headlining A Bridge Too Far with the likes of Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Gene Hackman, and Elliot Gould. Just another day's work for Kubrick. This isn't his best-known work, but it's still a masterpiece.",Barry Lyndon
194,Eviljomr,Pure Kubrick,9,1 September 2000,"I was really surprised at how much I ended up liking this movie, I watched it recently, and my mindset going into it was was ""well, it'll be well-photographed and have the usual interesting Kubrick thematics, but it'll probably feel kinda long, and you probably won't have a big urge to rewatch it anytime soon, sort of like Eyes Wide Shut"".  Thankfully, I was wrong, I wouldn't call the 18th century costume drama my favorite type of film, but I found this one to be very absorbing.  Even though it's a bit over three hours long, it never feels ""slow"" or ""boring"", there's a lot that goes on in it.  Like all Kubrick films, there's a lot of different layers to it, and you probably have to watch it more than once to get everything out of it.  The famous duel scene toward the end of the film is one of the best I've ever seen, right up there with the climax of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (even though they couldn't be much more different).  The more ominous ""duel version"" of the film's main theme that starts before the actual duel and goes on for what feels like about 20 minutes (I didn't time it) works almost like the audio equivalent of Chinese water torture and helps to bring the tension to a nearly unbearable level.  A great film, worth the investment of three hours.",Barry Lyndon

Every single frame is so gorgeous and beautifully photographed. The composition is indescribable in words or even sentences. The bgm is so gripping and beautiful that it will grab you mind hook you on the screen. All of this combined with incredible production design and amazing costume design makes this an all-perfect work of filmography.The story is about Redmond Barry a man who seems to be helpless in the beginning and went through certain hardships and finally became an opportunist and he reached at a position where he acquired great glory. As things changed, he also changed. Once a helpless innocent man became a man of cruelty and immorality. Finally, he got what he deserved. Vengeance paid off on him and lost everything he gained.This movie advocates the philosophy of change in life and also it says that nothing is permanent. One day the mortal coil will be lost. In afterlife there is no good and bad or rich and poor and everyone will be equal because everyone will be in the sleep from which they can't wake up. And this will happen to everybody no matter what.",Barry Lyndon

Its visuals amaze; every shot is set up so perfectly, it's stunning just to watch the shots begin to ""unfold"", become fully composed and ""lined up"", for want of a better term. In fact, pretty much everything about this movie is amazing and honed to perfection - the acting, the cinematography, the drama - even just the colours themselves are gorgeous to look at!There's very little criticism I can find with this film - so much so that I'm struggling to find anything I can really criticise right off the top of my head. The only slight criticism I can find is that, at times, it seems the characters' accents can 'slip' out a little here and there i.e. Ryan O'Neal's Irish accent seems to come and go quite frequently. But this isn't enough to truly diminish the film's rating at all. A 10/10 from me doesn't mean the film is perfect - but Barry Lyndon comes unbelievably close.",Barry Lyndon

Barry Lyndon is of course no exception, in fact it's one of his very finest films, at least in my opinion.Everything here is perfection, the music, the acting, the script, and of course the filming and direction. All is simply superb. The film may be long,it may have slow pacing and there may not be that much dialog in it, but none of it hampers the film. Kubrick tells the story mainly through image rather than sound, and said story is so engrossing that the three hours simply whiz by.I don't really know what else I can say beside the fact that it's superb. It's as impressive as ever and really doesn't pale in comparison to more recent features, so really don't hesitate to watch it on the grounds that it may be ""dated"".

202,DhavalVyas,The main character deserved worse,6,25 October 2005,"I have to give credit to Stanley Kubrick for being the only director to never make the same film twice. If one were to watch all of his movies, one would never know they were made by the same man. This is incredibly hard to do and very few filmmakers have undertaken that risk. Even fewer filmmakers have undertaken that risk and were successful at it. Kubrick was both and that might be one reason why he is loved by so many film lovers all over the world. Although I can give him credit for that, I also feel his films are deeply flawed and some are quite boring.'Barry Lyndon' is a lot like many other Kubrick films. It is directed in stunning fashion, with several brilliant sequences throughout. It is beautiful to look at and the costumes great. At the same time, the film fails in creating a character the audience can like watching for over three hours. I doubt many film lovers can possibly like the main character of this film. He is a user and an opportunist; he has almost no sympathy for the people he has hurt and used throughout his lifetime. Something bad happens to him at the end of this story. Although it is bad, I felt that he deserved much worse than what he got.

A marvelous story, based on a great novel. Somewhat too slow for some people. Psychological depth, even though the main character (you can't call him ""hero"")is rather despicable. A beautiful picture of 18th century society and morals, underlined by beautiful 18th century music. Great acting. Splendid photography.

There is an amazing background music, which will never let you off. Apart from this there is nothing much to the movie, it has a simple script where initially I felt like Forrest Gump but soon after wards it became pretty much clichéd, so I was not interested in watching the second half as you could predict what would happen. But the forest part till the intermission id quite entertaining with all the lovely sceneries and women, costumes and what not. From an art point of view this movie would feel like a beautiful painting but do not expect more from the movie, there are many scenes which seem to be not useful to the script or bearing no importance at all, but still the compensates all these errors with an amazing background score.

As everyone falls down one day, Barry also does his share of mistakes and pays for it.Only Kubrick can direct a story like this in such a beautiful way, Too good. To find a plot is one thing and to direct a movie in a nice way is another. The music is also a high point in the movie.I simply loved it.

Just imagine if Michael Caine had been cast in the main role, he would have created some humour and sympathy for a basically disgusting, cowardly and hateful character. But no, Ryan O'Neal runs the gamut of the emotions from A to B. He has the charisma of an ""I speak your weight"" machine, and I just could not wait for him to get what he deserved.I give this a 2, it would have been 1 but there are some good shots of the scenery (which does a better acting job than the principals).",Barry Lyndon

This film was slammed by the critics when it came out (""Slow!"" ""Boring!""  ""Ponderous!"") but the critics were wrong...I didn't see ""Barry Lyndon"" until a year or so ago, but was fortunate to see it in a theatre, the second half of a double feature with ""The Duelist"" (another excellent film, by the way.)  I mention the circumstances, because... despite BL being 3 hours long, and coming after another movie that ran over two hours, at the intermission point, I found myself thinking, ""Intermission?  Already?  But that could only have been about an hour...""Add on top of this another detail: I loathe Ryan O'Neal -- yet was compelled by his performance here...Finally, this little double-feature fest came at the end of a l-o-o-o-ong work day, but I was wide awake and fully alert at the end of ""Barry Lyndon.""Why?  Because Kubrick managed to stuff every scene with full emotional impact, and there's a dueling scene late in the film that has such excruciating emotional stakes, it's utterly heartrending -- managed, by the way, with the entire thing shot from an apparently passive, far away wide-angle, locked-down camera, at a very leisurely pace.  Nod to Kubrick's genius -- he does everything in the scene to alienate the audience from what's happening, and yet we're glued to it, gripping our seats, hoping that what happens won't happen, heaving a collective groan of pain when it does.And, on top of all that, the entire film was shot only with light sources available within the period it takes place -- i.e., candles, candles, candles, or the sun.  It was a bold experiment in the early days of fast film, and it works; moreso than almost any film set in the period, we are there.  (The only thing that gets close that I can think of off hand is ""Revolution,"" the underrated Al Pacino venture from the early 80s -- but it derives its ""you are there"" from historical accuracy and detail.)Anyway, this is all the long way about of saying that ""Barry Lyndon"" is worth a second look, and a third -- and definitely a first if you've never seen it.  Don't let the length scare you, because the story will grab you so fast, you won't notice.  Don't let Ryan O'Neal scare you, because everything unlikeable about him works to the advantage of the story here...And, finally, for you ""Clockwork Orange"" fans -- watch carefully, my droogies, because the structure of ""Barry Lyndon"" mirrors the structure of ""A Clockwork Orange"" perfectly -- and yet tells us an entirely different tale.",Barry Lyndon

The WAY it is those things.It's a matter of how you approach it. That it has a languid pace is undeniable -- and exactly what Kubric intended.  Think of it as an extended music video -- for languid, classical chamber music (or sweet sorrow funerial music) and you will be more in the right frame of mind to fully enjoy this movie.  (Actually, I wish the DVD had the same option which Amadeus has -- to run with the visuals and the music score only, when viewing for the upteenth time.)This movie absolutely is a historical ""costume drama"" -- and like most of Kubric's movies, takes that form to new heights of expression.While 2001 is visually gorgeous and intellectually fascinating -- but emotionally ice cold, Barry Lyndon is emotionally warm like a nice soaking bath -- after sex and a shared bottle of wine.Visually stunning in every way.

If you think Barry Lyndon is boring, taste and patience are not your virtues. In my opinion, this is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, for it is his most intimate and gorgeous film. Its strengths include its narration, sets, costumes, use of baroque and classical music, but most of all, its cinematography. Using only natural light whenever possible, nearly every shot of this film looks like an 18th century European oil painting fit for a king. Any single frame could be blown up and framed and hung on a wall. Based on William Makepeace Thackeray's novel, it is a rags-to-riches story about a young Irish man who climbs his way up to aristocracy by any means, including marrying a English widow and squandering her wealth. But what goes up always comes down. Some say that the casting of Ryan O'Neal as the protagonist was a mistake, but I disagree. O'Neal possesses the persona of the impressionable and emotionally vulnerable Barry. This is a film mostly devoid of emotion, yet leaves a profound emotional impact. The final result is pure art, which easily merits from me a 10/10 rating.",Barry Lyndon
212,david-greene5,Possibly filmdom's most unique period epic.,10,13 May 2008,"When I was a film maker, I learned a very sad lesson. When it comes to audience approval, a monumentally great film can fail in the box office if viewers come to it with preconceived expectations that are wrong. MGM hyped David Lean's magnificent ""Ryan's Daughter"" as another ""Doctor Zhivago"". It was nothing of the kind. If you attended a screening of that show with this in mind, you would very likely be confused and disappointed by the radically different sort of picture it is. In the case of ""Barry Lyndon"", that process worked in reverse for me. I missed seeing it when it was first released. I heard many negative reviews and comments suggesting that it was a slack, slow failure. ""Kubrick had bombed at last!"" Years later, I finally caught up with it and saw it, pretty much to satisfy my curiosity about this major failure from a major director. I was thunderstruck to discover that it seemed instead to be the greatest film Kubrick made. I know that the controversy rages on and many agree with me, while many do not. I will say that, although I hardly expect to win over ""Barry Lyndon""s detractors, I think that it will stand the test of time far better than say, ""2001, a Space Odyssey"" which, although it must be lauded as a legendary ground-breaker in its day, does not play nearly as well today. For me, ""2001"" simply does not reward repeated viewing anywhere near as richly as ""Barry Lyndon"". If you haven't seen this one, see it only on a giant screen, giving it your undivided attention. Judge it for yourself. It is too unique and amazing to be missed.",Barry Lyndon
213,eichler2,"Overlong, stiff, boring period drama",3,14 February 2016,"I'm a big fan of Kubrick's films, so back in the early days of DVDs I bought a boxed set that contained Dr. Strangelove, 2001, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Lolita and Barry Lyndon. I had never seen the last two on that list, so I was really looking forward to watching them. Lolita, apart from the intentionally creepy subject matter, wasn't bad. And then I got to Barry Lyndon.On first viewing, I couldn't believe this movie was made by the same person who had made those others. What a dull, dragging, pretentious...did I mention dull?...movie this is. Now, I can handle deliberately slow-paced movies. I love 2001 and that film is almost as glacially paced as this one. But when that slow pace is coupled with a painfully boring story and wooden acting, it makes for a nearly unwatchable movie.It probably didn't help that Warner Brothers crammed a movie that's over three hours long onto a single DVD, resulting in sub-VHS video quality. But within half an hour I was looking at the clock, wondering how much longer the movie had to go. By the time it reached the intermission an hour and 40 minutes in, when most movies would have the decency to just end, I was ready to give up. But I soldiered on and watched the remaining hour and a half...I should have just gone with my original instincts.What made me return to this movie recently was that my wife is a big fan of 18th century period piece movies, so she had watched the last two thirds of this one on TV and asked me to get the DVD out so she could see the part she missed. She liked the detailed costumes and settings, and actually enjoyed the story. So I thought maybe my original opinion had been hasty and maybe I should give it another try.Nope, this movie is just awful. Such flat, bland acting and boring direction it's like the film was given some experimental treatment to extract any emotion, action or interest from it. The main character, Redmond Barry, rises from poverty in Ireland to wealth and high society in Europe not by any virtues of his own, but mostly through stupidity, cowardice and cheating. Once he finally steals the wife of a sickly Lord, he loses any likability he had in the first half of the movie and changes suddenly into a disagreeable jerk who mistreats his wife and cheats on her while squandering her family fortune. Why exactly are we supposed to care about this guy? I guess you can't expect perfection every time, but it's hard to believe the same guy who created Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and Clockwork Orange was responsible for this mess.Maybe it's just because I prefer sci-fi to period dramas, but I can't for the life of me understand why this clunker has an 8.1 average on IMDb and so many people have given it raving reviews. I can appreciate that the costumes, dialog and settings are all very authentic to the time period, but so what? That alone doesn't make for a good movie. This film should only be taken as a cure for insomnia.",Barry Lyndon
214,santegeezhe,"Visually stunning, surprisingly watchable film",6,25 January 2008,"I honestly wasn't expecting much from this film based on previous reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. It proved to be a sumptuous, visually stunning period piece which is surprisingly watchable despite the three-hour length.The good news is that the film is a gorgeous spectacle to behold, with nearly every shot being a visual delight. Apparently most of the film was shot using natural light due to the use of NASA designed cameras with extremely fast shutter speed, yadda yadda, but you know all that already. Also on the plus side, while the story tends to meander a bit there's still enough going on that I never quite lost interest. I wish I could say the same for every three-hour epic I've sat through...Now the bad news...While watching this film I got the distinct impression that Kubrick concentrated almost solely on the visuals to the exclusion of almost everything else. Thus, the plot meanders, the characterization is poor or nearly non-existent in some cases, and the musical score is extremely repetitive and boring.However, there's still enough beauty in this film for me to give it a positive review and recommend it to other Kubrick fans or period-piece aficionados.",Barry Lyndon
215,Darren-12,Most Beautiful Film Ever Made,8,23 January 2001,"Many factors contribute to what makes a good movie. Occasionally, a movie stands out so much in one particular area that it outweighs it's shortcomings in others. Shot-composition, lighting and costume-design combine to make this the most beautiful movie ever made. Many, if not most, scenes could be displayed in art galleries as old masters and no-one would notice. At just over three hours long, the pace rarely seems to drag, because the viewer is so caught up in the mind-boggling beauty being paraded before his/her eyes.From the Thackeray novel of an Irish lad's adventures, rise in society and ultimate demise, Kubrick plays it as a tragi-comedy of manners, which fits well with the narration from the novel and the stagey visuals, but I found myself wishing for better rounded characters: Marisa Berenson should have been a key character, but she is hardly even given a line; Ryan O'Neal is actually rather good, but I'm sure he could have done even better with more script to work with. But characterisation has never been what Kubrick is about anyway, so I guess he was playing to his strengths. A monumental achievement that deserves to be more widely appreciated.",Barry Lyndon
216,Wolfi-10,fascinating historical show,8,22 March 2003,"Fine acting, beautiful photography, haunting music and sure-footed direction show a - probably very realistic - slice of life of the English gentry in the 18th century, which is fascinating by itself. The story is captivating too but leaves a nagging question. The human soul can of  course undergo many changes, yet Barry Lyndon's change from a good-at-heart  lad in part I of the movie to a stupidly cheating husband and excessively  behaving father, either intemperate or overindulgent, in part II is a  little baffling. Kubrick deviated here from Thackeray's original novel,  where the protagonist is somewhat of a rogue throughout, and tried to  add a measure of human development to the adventure story. Yet the change  for the worse happens quite swiftly, and marriage seems to be the cause.  So the movie provides some things dazzling to watch, and some more  things intriguing to contemplate afterwards...",Barry Lyndon

218,bejasus,"Acquired Taste, but Glad I Acquired It",10,17 December 2004,"I rented this on DVD from Netflix, and -- not for the first time -- I was glad to have Netflix's no deadline policy.I hadn't seen it before, and it took me several viewings to start to realize what an extraordinary movie this is. I had a hard time paying attention, and kept getting distracted, it seemed so ponderous.So, that ponderous pace probably makes Barry Lyndon worthy of being the commercial and popular failure it seems to have been.But as art, it is a remarkable creation. And as an adaptation from a novel, it is a remarkable interpretation of a very interesting novel.People find Ryan O'Neal's Barry Lyndon painfully artificial and stilted, but all that stiltedness really sets the viewer up for one of the most heart-wrenching scenes on film (his last conversation with his angelic little boy). All the words of bravado and deception are there in that conversation, but now, ironically, as Barry realizes how those war-stories pale in comparison to what he is losing. This scene has outstanding acting, outstanding direction, outstanding screenplay, outstanding art direction -- you name it.And then, as Barry's attempt at nobility is in tatters, he has the famous duel with the stepson who hates him. And in that scene, Barry Lyndon does the first truly noble act of his entire life -- and it costs him everything.Life is short; art is long. I'm glad I spent the time I needed to appreciate this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is willing to invest the time to appreciate it.

I was expecting a cheesy Lifetime quality film. Wow... was I wrong. I should have known better, though. It was by Stanley Kubrick, after all.After seeing the Barry Lyndon, uninterrupted, my entire view of what a costume drama could be changed. Barry Lyndon is now on my favorite films ever list. The story of the lead character, the people he encounters, the good and bad that comes to his life, is all told through master filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, the film's writer, producer, and director.Barry Lyndon is 3 hours perfection. I seriously can't find anything wrong with it. Everything from the acting, cinematography, music, to the screenplay is top notch.If you're a true Stanley Kubrick fan, meaning you don't watch his films solely for the sex and violence, and actually enjoy his talents as an artist, check out Barry Lyndon. You'll be very happy you did.",Barry Lyndon
221,alasdair7,The most beautiful lighting in cinema history,10,11 September 2020,This film began an interest in photography with me that has lasted to this present day.Its visual splendour alone is my recommendation for anyone to watch this film. Make sure that you study every scene closely and multiple times. After all Kubrick does not insist on a multitude of takes for nothing!Where possible I was led to believe that studio lighting was avoided and hundreds of candles can be seen in the indoor scenes.The skin tones are perfect and the incredible beauty of Marisa Berenson adds to the visual feast.Some great characters appear in the film including Captain Feeny (Arthur O'Sullivan).A masterclass in lighting and a highly entertaining film that must be watched slowly and in detail many times.,Barry Lyndon

223,harry-austin,A Hidden Gem from Kubrick,8,4 July 2011,"It is a shame that Kubrick is only remembered for Eyes Wide Shut, A Clockwork Orange and the Shining to name a few. While more 'die hard' film fans will be more aware of his other films, Barry Lyndon is a fantastic film.From what I know, it is relatively historically accurate. I am not going to be pedantic and study every last detail and then announce 'wait a minute, in the 18th Century a soldier would not have been awarded that medal' because that is not the point. The basics are right, and that is all that is needed. The way in which the armies march forward in lines is entirely correct, and how while individual men are shot down, the rest stay in perfect formation. The battle scenes are certainly a highlight. Purely because of the vivid costumes and the scale, Kubrick really makes a spectacle.The decadence of the society that Lyndon has been able to become a part of is also really emphasised the the costumes, the film won various awards for the quality of the costumes in 1975. The elaborate dresses worn by the women to the tail coats of the men are all so finely detailed, there is always something to be in awe of.The acting is also as good as the costumes. Michael Hordern is flawless in his role as the narrator. Which is a good thing too - considering that the film is well over three hours in length! Horderns clear, yet powerful voice keeps you on the ball with the plot if you struggle with films that are any longer than two hours. Ryan O'Neal, despite being American does not struggle to put on the rugged Irish accent of Barry Lyndon, making the film even more believable.This is truly a marvellous historical drama. Don't expect battle scenes that are comparable to the scenes in Zulu, but watching a film from this period was a breath of fresh air considering that nearly all war films in the seventies and eighties were based on Vietnam!",Barry Lyndon
224,dustinkdye,Kubrick's overlooked classic,8,28 July 2013,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a work of art. Meaning it is like a painting put onto film. It is as if director Stanley Kubrick transported us into the world of the paintings on the walls of a fine art gallery. Released in 1975, between ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) and ""The Shining"" (1980), ""Barry Lyndon"" is perhaps the most overlooked of Kubrick's later films.Like Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Full Metal Jacket,"" ""Barry Lyndon"" is a disjointed story. Michael Hordern's narration, while sometimes stating the obvious, holds the movie together and eases the transition between sequences. The movie is split into two parts, which can quickly be summed up as Barry's rise in the first half and fall in the second.The first half is Redmond Barry's rags-to-riches story. Barry is a sympathetic character. He is young and naive. He is in love with his cousin, but too shy to touch her. He is simultaneously awkward and stubborn as he picks a fight with his cousin's suitor, and later duels him. After the duel, Barry has to leave home, and he gets robbed at gun point on his way to town. He eventually joins the army, but later deserts, only to be conscripted into another army. He falls in with a wealthy gentleman, and begins his ascent into the life of an aristocrat.The second half documents Barry's fall. He marries the beautiful and (more importantly) wealthy Lady Honoria Lyndon, and changes his name to Barry Lyndon. In his quest for acceptance among the aristocracy he squanders his wife's wealth and step-son's inheritance, alienating his family. As Barry cheats on his beautiful and generous wife, the character we sympathized with in the first half gradually forces us to view him with cold detachment, which is what I think Kubrick was expecting the audience to do through the cinematography he used.One camera technique Kubrick employs throughout is to center close-up on a character, and then zoom out, letting our eyes take in the full setting. The characters may take the beautiful scenery for granted, but Kubrick makes sure the audience doesn't. While this worked in some scenes, I thought it was overused, and created a barrier between the audience and the characters at times. The characters are like the bloodless portraits adorning an art gallery.The duels and battle scenes, however, find the perfect tone. The long takes, rare in today's films, lend a gritty reality to the violence on the screen. A filmmaker today might show these scenes in a series of shaky takes lasting less than two seconds, alternating between quick- fire close-ups, attempting to get our blood flowing through fast-paced editing.""Barry Lyndon"" may be a bit too slow-paced for the MTV2 generation, but it is a pleasure for anyone who appreciates artistic film-making. Let anyone who thinks Kubrick's films are tedious gorge themselves on ""Transformers,"" while more discerning cinephiles can now enjoy ""Barry Lyndon"" on Blu-ray.",Barry Lyndon
225,adam_pittavino,Wizardry like movie making!,10,11 May 2013,"For a large majority of Stanley Kubrick fanatics, Barry Lyndon could well be considered his finest directorial achievement. For the others, it's a misunderstood drawn out period piece that is painfully painfully too long. I'd like to think that 1975's Barry Lyndon is the envy of dedicated film makers, the perfect portrayal of a rouge young Irishman who's opportunistic, fortune seeking destiny end's in inevitable misery. Although this film isn't thought of as Kubrick's most experimental, it is definitely his most polished, picturesque and quite possibly analyzed. I've watched this film several times over the last 10 years and I still really enjoy it, I'm glad that its grown in stature over the last few years...that's the true indication of a film, not the box office takings.

However, I had to force myself to watch Barry Lyndon. It was three hours of my life that I'll never get back. The cinematography was outstanding, but the story was overrated and the plot was dull. I can usually appreciate movies for what they are, but it's unfair to expect anyone to sit through this movie and get anything out of it other than wasted time. 4/10 (it's only that much because of the cinematography and because it's Kubrick)",Barry Lyndon

The first half has Redmond Barry (as Barry Lyndon was then known) as an innocent and somewhat naive young man who is taken advantage of by various people. He seems to have remained an innocent even after he leaves the Prussian army where he is portrayed as having been exposed to all manner of deprivation.However in the second half of the movie he suddenly becomes a downright evil character. I found the transformation somewhat unexpected and at odds with the way the plot had developed up until then.Apart from that I really enjoyed the movie. The settings are fabulous with lots of color and big panoramic shots, and the acting is of a high standard despite most of the case being relatively unknown except for Ryan O'Neal. This music is also very memorable.Excellent movie.",Barry Lyndon
228,jasonsurety,Beautiful,10,1 March 2004,"Barry Lyndon is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen.  It is well known that this picture was shot with natural light.  This works so well I found myself pausing the movie to admire many scenes.  The landscapes galvanize the eyes.  Victorian England has never looked so good.For many this may not be enough.  For me, it would've been but didn't have to be.  I found Barry Lyndon to be very thought provoking as well as resplendent.  Can't we all relate to Redmond Barry(Barry Lyndon) in this film?  Don't we all long to be respected and to ""do something"" in our lives? Don't we all have flaws?  Of course.  This film is extremely relevant despite being a 20th century movie about a 19th century novel about a relatively unimportant 18th century life.POSSIBLE SPOILER: This movie also contains one of the most gut-wrenching scenes on film. Barry's stepson warrants punishment, but Barry unfashionably deals with him. It is the worst way possible in light of the high society he is among. Barry lashes out with raw emotion and pulverizes the despicable youth in front of a large crowd.  This is an unbelievably pertinent display of violence.  It disturbed me that, on some level, I actually enjoyed watching this beating.  The ironic and poignant thing about this event, is that it is essentially the downfall of Barry.  If he were to have challenged the young man to a duel and killed him, the society at-large would have been much more forgiving.  The lashing he gave publicly, that only wounded the stepson, was deemed so lurid by the crowd, news of his cruelty spread and his reputation was decimated.",Barry Lyndon

A student of mine at the time told me that her dad said ""Barry Lyndon"" was the most beautiful movie he'd ever seen. That made me even more stoked.At the theater, I recall waiting for something to happen. Yes, I knew it wasn't going to be like ""Clockwork Orange,"" but I still believed that something would actually happen.All I remember to this day are scenes that dragged on interminably. Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson sitting in a coach while he smoked a cigar or something, as she daintily waved the smoke away. This scene seemed to go on for hours, though I'm sure it lasted maybe just a minute or so.Yes, the cinematography was beautiful, but the movie was beyond boring.

There are some who may say that this film is too long or stale, but I say, that this film must be savoured slowly, and that one must enjoy it for what it is, which is almost like a series of ethereal paintings, one after another. Watch this film not for the end, but watch it and live with the fact that every scene is a part of the whole, and that the wholeness and oneness in itself is beautiful.

If you wanna see Kubrick at his most artful, well that's Barry Lyndon, but A Clockwork Orange is a close second, and what I really wish is that Kubrick could have put all the brilliance he put into Barry Lyndon into a good film.

236,kanerazor,Kubrick's unheralded work of art,10,5 March 2002,"Warning: Plot spoilers aheadStanley Kubrick made many a masterpiece, no film lover would deny that. It's unfortunate however, that Barry Lyndon is often cited as a failure on his part, for it is breathtaking by any standards.  It is beautifully constructed; not the least of its merits are the gorgeous sets, the haunting score (right up there with that from A Clockwork Orange), and the dazzling use of natural light.  The screenplay also deserves praise, with the cryptic ""spoiling"" narration being an oddly effective touch.  We the viewers are made to care about Barry's well being; I for one was rooting for his happiness in the beginning and was deeply saddened by his ultimate fate. In particular, I agree with the opinion of David Hughes, author of ""The Complete Kubrick"": the death of Barry's young son Bryan is one of the most heartbreaking scenes ever committed to cinema.  Leon Vitali does a great job as Lord Bullingdon (especially during the intense climactic duel) but Ryan O'Neal in the title role is the film's one weakness.  An actor with more charisma and range would have been better suited; O'Neal seems to be phoning it in at times.  However, he is still an appealing star, and does not diminish the quality in any way.All in all, this movie is long and slowly paced, and unlike most everything you've seen.

239,qiowisj,Arguably the best period piece of all time,10,28 February 2007,"Barry Lyndon is a film that covers a wide range of dramatic subjects which near the edge of melodrama, but skillfully never steps over. Ambition, love, tragedy, hatred, courage, power, lust; I could go on and on. True, other films have depicted these topics in 18th century Europe, many obviously done so very well. However, this is a Kubrick picture and he has brought all his talent to the forefront here. Each frame, as usual, is visually arresting, photographed as if it were a painting of that era with actual motion. The story never meanders, despite the fact that the movie relates a large portion of a man's life and career. The acting, though low key in comparison to the lush surroundings, nonetheless achieves the aim of each actor. The final scene with Lyndon's son in particular is heartbreaking. Kubrick's choice of music, both original and borrowed, fits perfectly into key segments and generally heightens the mood.Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best in my opinion, a work of art that transcends decades.",Barry Lyndon
240,m-sendey,"""A monumental masterpiece by Stanley Kubrick""",10,16 March 2013,"The story takes place in 18th Century. A young Irish called Barry falls in love with his cousin and upon disclosing the rival in captain John Quin and his affection towards his beloved woman he resolves to regain her, even if it is indispensable to kill Quin. The instant everything appears to be ended up between him and his cousin, he insults Quin by casting a glass right at his face and demands having a duel with him which he eventually wins. Being positive that he killed his opponent, he leaves his parts so as to evade consequences of his act and discover a better place to start a new life.This is frequently a disregarded effort in Kubrick's carrier which is quite astonishing since Kubrick achieves an utterly ravishing level of cinematic beauty and it remains one of his greatest feats. Whereas any other director could transform the script into an uneven work – a hodgepodge of stronger and weaker scenes, every aspect of Kubrick's masterpiece seems to be polished to an absolute perfection and shows that we are dealing with a great, self-disciplined master. The story is based on the novel by William Makepeace Thackeray. Barry Lyndon which often feels like a relation of the book forasmuch some events occurring on the screen are simply recounted by the narrator. Notwithstanding, it never becomes anyhow discordant or contradictory with the general concept, actually it is difficult to envision the movie without this element which gives it a distant perspective and thus render the flick more historical and epic. It has a great deal of subplots which slightly reminds of Full Metal Jacket. In that film, it does not diminish the excellence of Kubrick's rendition, however, owing to an exploited episodic structure, the ensemble invariably appears to be a little clutter, skipping from one location to another and it is incapable of creating an appropriate atmosphere, particularly in the second half, when a viewer is taken aback by an unexpected transition from a traverse, where a dehumanizing training of soldiers occurs, into a Vietnam chapter. One never recaptures the mood and the second part does not conjure up a suggestive climax of isolation in the jungle which would be adequate. Fortunately, Kubrick is always aware of his aim in Barry Lyndon, he does not delve into digressions that much. In spite of implicating a lot of minor episodes which sometimes slightly reminiscent of the above-mentioned film released 12 years later, the subject does not feel diluted with unnecessary subplots nor is it self-indulgent – the action always revolves around the protagonist. The pace is always right, neither rushed, nor excessively languorous. The story flows steadily. The narrative structure is simple and fortunately not oversophisticated, the linear storytelling makes it all comprehensive and the plot is easy to follow.Whereas one is accompanying Barry becoming a soldier and struggling through the atrocities of war, Kubrick shows an indubitable brilliance in combat scenes which despite being few and far between are ravishingly portentous and electrifying. Successively, while the main hero slowly withdraws from the war and regains the status of a gentleman, a viewer is able to observe Kubrick's apt eye for visuals. Every frame is fascinating, not only owing to the opulence of scenography, but also on account of a sublime cinematography of John Alcott, who utilizes various colours ranging variations of grey, blue and finally warmer colours like red as well as yellow with talent of a prominent painter. The palette of hues is far from lollypop framing of A Clockwork Orange. Exploiting his talent for catching imposing images, Kubrick creates one of the best portrayals of 18th century and through the role of Barry who eventually comes to power, perfectly exposes the situation of those times. Notwithstanding, he never forgets about the major point of the story – the exploration of the power's impact on Barry's character who is more and more becoming a vain male. He disregards love of his wife, he prefers organizing orgies and having affairs to leading a traditional life, hence he becomes someone totally different from what he was at the beginning.Ryan O'Neal is superb as Barry Lyndon. He shows an undisputable creativity with this undoubtedly complex role which gives him a great opportunity to expose his acting skills. He eschews being classified as a righteous persona or a straight-forward villain. He succeeds in being arrogant and charming at the same time. The moment one is likely to cease to sympathise with him, he seemingly becomes an elegant and nice man. Marisa Berenson is quite good as Lady Honoria Lyndon, although she is not remarkable anyhow and rather stays in the background. Marie Kean gives the best performance in the supporting cast as Barry's mother whose possessiveness is revealed near the end. This is something really fascinating and her character's development is atypically delightful. Towards the finale she is rather unlikable and the only matter she cares about is her son's fate.The soundtrack consisting of music composed by John Sebastian Bach, Leonard Rosenman and The Chieftains is a great addition to the ensemble and the movie's classical feeling is even more articulate. The breath-taking cinematography and the ravishing palette of colours, the opulent scenography, the top-notch acting, the tremendous script – they all cooperate with each other excellently.Saying that Barry London is no cinematic achievement is like arguing that sawdust is an exquisite dish. Kubrick did everything to render this a masterpiece and the execution is undeniably remarkable. Long as it is, this is also one of the most beautiful flicks ever created. The magnificence and its monumental nature overwhelms a viewer. The fabulousness of Kubrick's vision is simply eye-popping and jaw-dropping. It is one of the biggest treasures of worldwide cinema and a real tour-de-force that deserves more recognition that it actually received.",Barry Lyndon
241,sunking,It is worth seeing for the duel alone,10,29 May 1999,"I was watching TV one morning when Barry Lyndon came on the set. Because I missed the opening credits I didn't even know that Stanley had anything to do with this picture. In fact I though this picture was made in the mid 90's due to its spectacular photography. I was sucked into the movie and was captured by its very moment. I must say though, that the best scene in the whole movie is the duel between Barry and his stepson. I heard it took 42 days to edit this scene alone, and I must say it is worth it. The music and direction and fantastic. I was surprised to learn that Stanley directed this movie, since it was in such contrast to A Clockwork Orange.So I say see it, as it is pure art as a motion picture.",Barry Lyndon
242,DeathFish,Like a dream of a slow and gentle kiss.,10,1 March 2007,"This movie is one the most beautiful movies I have ever seen, perhaps only surpassed by Kubrick's ""2001: A space odyssey"". This slow-paced tale is brought to life by beautiful images and painting-like scenarios, supported by one of my favorite music themes of all time. Watching this movie is almost like stepping back in time, experiencing every detail of this epic story together with the characters. The plot of the story is intriguing and full of amazing events that keeps you floating through the entire 3 hour trip.Even though Ryan O'Neal is not the most respected actor through history, and many have written that he delivers a poor performance, I think he makes a remarkable performance, and gives a mysterious shade of life to the main character. He is quite dull in many scenes, but nonetheless he captures this strange dreamlike feeling which on one side drives you nuts and on the other side gently drags you into this imaginary world.The wonderful achievement Kubrick makes is to set up the scenery as if it was a painting, giving it a beautiful surrealistic touch to reality so to say, mixed with the great choice of music and lighting, this simply pays of as this master worked pearl of film-making.Generally this movie is a masterpiece from start to finish, with top notch set up, lighting, filming, music, narrator, acting and story. Everything composed together in harmony, bringing this historical era to life in a way that no other movie has ever managed to do. In my opinion a greatly underrated piece of art by the late Stanley Kubrick.10/10",Barry Lyndon
243,Neucosa,"Beautiful Cinematography, Tough Sell Otherwise",6,22 December 2007,"The story of the NASA lenses and their use in the candlelight scenes should be enough for anyone who cares about the presentation of clever cinematography to watch this film. There are countless scenes of beauty in this film and Kubrick takes great care in presenting them in a consistent and lovely way. The biggest problem with the movie is everything else. The writing and acting seems stale at many points during the film resulting in a film which is quite a chore to review even given the luscious scenery that the cinematography gives us. If you care about the visual qualities of immersion that movie making can give you, then watch this film. If you are interested in period pieces of the 18th century, watch this film. Beyond that, it's your choice whether you wish to struggle through this epic.",Barry Lyndon
244,uprashanthnayak,Kubrick's Best Film,10,5 February 2014,"Stanley Kubrick was born to direct ""Barry Lyndon"" - a complete masterpiece. It is classically British in its quality, penned by William Makepeace Thackeray as a serialized picaresque novel that was cast into public view in 1844, and it took the next century for a man of the same soil to emerge and decide to bring the words to suitable life. A vital asset is Michael Hordern's voice-over: one of the best ever in cinema: possessing a measured, witty and omniscient nature .By the film's end, it is very difficult to sympathize with Redmond Barry (a pitch-perfect Ryan O' Neal) who rises from a tough beginning in rural Ireland in the 17th century, to eventually come into receipt of a greatly comfortable life. But the central triumph here is that we receive a ""God's Eye"" view - with a perspective like this, the protagonist does not matter that much. Exquisite visuals inform the story from the get-go, and the background music is elegantly orchestral.All the conflict and perspective in the first half is peppered with considerable humor .In the second half, the dramatic force comes from the vehement, articulate anger of a severely insulted heir and Barry's delusional belief that he can merrily tap-dance through high society while slaughtering all its unsaid edicts. Through all this, the calm observational tone is paired with John Alcott's beautiful framing and vistas of stately splendor -one scene after another presents like a thoughtfully played card. What remains rock-steady is the lovely perspicacity of Kubrick's directorial vision and tenor. Kubrick has rarely shown skill in depicting sentimentality but in Barry Lyndon, empowered by a narrative that awakens the genius in him, Kubrick is roused to effectively depict emotional depth - watch the last scene between Barry and his son - there is so much of tenderness in the father's ""Of course I will"" reassurances that it is nearly enough to atone for the butchered sentiment in his other movies.As for sheer raw power, witness what transpires in a scene where the little son walks with hammer-soled shoes into the hall of his mother's piano performance. Kubrick takes the sac of the period drama and blows it up so rapidly that it explodes in a savage dazzling rupture of the genre's staid conventions. If all this has interested you, and if you'd still like to ""demand satisfaction"", it is quite likely, Sir, that 'Barry Lyndon' will give it to you.You may read the full review and other cinema analysis at: http://www.upnworld.com/movie/view/id/52/title/Barry+Lyndon",Barry Lyndon
245,thimage,Long winded,6,9 June 2012,"I never had the opportunity to watch this movie when it came out in the theaters. I was about 13 at the time and it didn't really appealed to an adolescent. Now, in 2012, I felt it was a must-see classic, so I rented it. It still feels like a big budget production and the attention to detail is really good. Now it might be felt as unfair to qualify this movie as long winded from a 2012 perspective. But to me, Kubrik always seems long winded in all his movies. I'd rather watch a Ridley Scott movie anytime.Yet this is not to say that Barry Lyndon is a bad movie, it's not. But I know I will never watch it again.It's depressing and leaves you with a feeling of ""What's the point?"" Does it portray typical human tragedy and greed? yes. Does it portray the pointless urge for ambition, even if one cannot bring it beyond death? Yes.But is there real need for a movie like that? I don't really know. I don't understand the passion that drove Kubrik to produce it, because the story leaves me cold. There's no hope in it.Conclusion: Good movie? no. Bad movie? no. A landmark? Probably a must because it's a Kubrik.",Barry Lyndon
246,gustaslietuva,Long but compelling,10,23 April 2021,"This is the longest Kubrick movie and that shows. I really felt the length. There are some sections in a movie where characters are just chilling around you know in a very beautiful places, and that is not very compelling for me. Nonetheless this movie has some very deep themes in it, and there are also places, where movie is very exciting. But it is my least rewatched Kubrick movie.",Barry Lyndon
247,Marco_AGJ,Barry Lyndon,9,2 February 2015,"Sometimes we forget that technology can change how we see things. This movie was released in 1975 but has such memorable, vivid scenery that's it's hard to imagine a movie that hasn't been tainted by the unforgiving test of time. If movies are moving images then this is one, images moving the eyes and soul.Every scene takes its time for the viewer to savor every bit of detail. Some of them are especially tasty, building tension as it goes by. I'm of course mentioning the two duel scenes. The second one is a test for the heart. The story about a humble guy that rises and falls is amazingly told. His love affairs, trickery, the desperate attempt to rise in 18th- century England. From the sharp voice lines to the monumental soundtrack. And of course, the last line in the movie which puts a lot of things in perspective. Truly a landmark.",Barry Lyndon
248,willow_chick88,Interesting,10,13 April 2004,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12. I found it drab, dull, boring, pointless, and any number of adjectives meaning boring. The only things that stuck in my head was the use of Handel's ""Sarabande"" and that I felt that Bullingdon was poorly treated. Recently I saw the movie again. What a difference nine years makes! The story was much more comprehensible and felt rather like ""Tom Jones"" without the convoluted ending. I particularly enjoyed the setting of late 18th- early 19th century Ireland. The story reads like an 18th century novel, in fact besides Thackeray's 19th century novel there are dozens of novels that follow the rises and falls of the scapegrace lads. There was only one disappointment with watching it again and that was finding that Bullingdon was really a pain in the butt. Chalk my feelings of sympathy up to some weird thing for Leon Vitale.There is one thing that this movie excels in and that is music. The way that Handel's ""Sarabande"" weaves its way in and out of the last 30 minutes of the film is truly beautiful. It can create tension or simply convey a stately grace. There is also the constant use of Schubert's Piano Trio, if I am not mistaken, which lends a feeling of continental refinement. Kubrick may have had some trouble connecting the audience with his films, but his matching music with what is on screen is unparalleled in my mind.",Barry Lyndon
249,ludvikmarki,May be the most Overlooked movie of all time!,10,23 July 2017,"This may be one of the most underrated movies of all time! This movie moves slow, and may be the reason it has such a bad rating compared to how good it actually is! People need to learn to watch slow moving films! In my opinion, Barry Lyndon may be among the 10 best movies ever made, and it has such a fascinating look, amazing story, many interesting stories, amazing acting, and is also among the best looking movies of all time!Stanley Kubrick put his heart into this movie, and made something so incredibly amazing. But this is still his most overlooked movie, and no one ever mentions this movie! Kubrick have made many of my favorite movies, among them: The shining, and a clockwork orange, but i consider this movies as good as these! No one else seems to have seen this movie, and amongst them who have seen it, never seem to like it as much as i do. Incredibly few people seem to have seen this movie the same way i have!This is in my opinion a must-see! It doesn't matter if you like slow moving movies or not, you should watch this movie and try to look at it the same way i do. If you can manage to do so, you will have a fascinating, and fantastic three hour period in front of you.10/10.",Barry Lyndon
250,sekander,Possibly the most beautiful movie ever shot,10,22 August 2013,"Although this movie came out in 1975, I didn't get around to it until about 2003, when I acquired the Stanley Kubrick box set. That's what happens when you listen to critics. The so-called ""experts"" panned this movie when it came out, probably because it was not 2001 or A Clockwork Orange or Dr. Strangelove. So the story isn't groundbreaking, so what. Its a great story, set in a great period and it is lovingly told by Kubrick. What was and is groundbreaking about Barry Lyndon was the cinematography. The whole movie was shot in natural light-a monumental achievement when you think about it. All of the nighttime scenes were shot by candlelight and it puts you right there in the 1760's. I can think of no other period piece movie that conveys the pre-electricity age so accurately-just one of the many reasons why this movie won so many awards, including the Oscar, for Cinematography. Filming at picturesque locales in Ireland, England and Germany didn't hurt, either. You just can't stop watching this movie.Kubrick continued his fabulous use of Classical music to enhance the action on screen in Barry Lyndon. No synthesizers here-only music faithful to the era performed on instruments that were in use at the time. Gorgeous cinematography...gorgeous music. The result is sublime. They don't make 'em like this anymore.",Barry Lyndon
251,thor5894,The first critics had it right,5,25 May 2020,"Barry Lyndon was slated by critics on release, kind of forgotten, but in recent years has been reappraised by many as one of Kubrick's great films. I side with the original critics. This is pretty to look at and also pretty pointless. The most glaring flaw is lightweight Ryan O'Neal in the lead role. He's a cipher impossible to care about, kind of a rogue but not an outright villain. The story proceeds as one would expect, there are slight satirical touches but nothing too biting, then it ends. It never gave me a reason to care. No idea what attracted Kubrick to the story or what he wanted to say with this. A large miss.",Barry Lyndon
252,wadetaylor,One of a kind film,8,3 August 2009,"Barry Lyndon is a one of a kind film. Every shot that Kubrick set up look like a painting. The use of mostly natural light, especially the candle-lit scenes really give Barry Lyndon a feeling as though someone grabbed a camera, then hopped into a time machine to film 18th century conversations. But all look and no plot do not make for good movies, but Barry Lyndon is a very interesting character. His moving from one place to another to try and up his social standing allows for the epic scope to be used for a very personal story. I found the most interesting aspect of his character to be his disdain for his stepson, and the resulting fistfight and later duel. Ryan O'Neill isn't especially great as Barry Lyndon, but it might be his best performance. He at least characterizes Lyndon as someone that could easily disappear into the shadows. He is not bombastic nor is he necessarily charming. But the most important thing about the movie is the cinematography. Every shot looks like a painting. The compositions work unlike any other movie I can think of. I recommend Barry Lyndon with only the reservation that it is a long movie, and you have to invest not only time, but you to be ready to study every inch of every frame just as you would a a painting by one of the masters.",Barry Lyndon
253,jackamccallum,A Renaissance Painting Brought to Life by Stanley Kubrick,8,28 June 2019,"Barry Lyndon is one of Stanley Kubrick's most visually sticking films. Kubrick masterfully uses blocking, color, framing and lighting to compose a number of shots throughout the film that resemble and look as if they were moving 18th-century paintings and the results are incredible with some shot's seeming like they should be framed and shown in an art gallery. The costumes, the makeup, the hair, the sets and locations and the sheer scale of the film make it seem like Kubrick has transported back in time to film his period piece. The story is well paced and although it has a run time just over three hours every scene serves a purpose to the overall narrative and the film never feels boring. That's not to say that some scenes can be quite slow at times but usually the film cuts to the next scene before it becomes irritating. The acting in the first half of the film is nothing much to admire but in the second act as Barry's life slowly goes downhill is when the performances really become interesting. Barry Lyndon is essential viewing for fans of period dramas and fans of Kubrick's work with the directors eye for incredibly detailed and precise shots being truly beautiful at times during the film.",Barry Lyndon
254,Leray97,One of the most beautiful looking films ever made,9,29 June 2018,"I can't get over how incredible this film's cinematography is. It's such an easy thing to point out when watching it but what John Alcott, (the cinematographer) has done for this movie is something that really elevates the whole thing to a different level, one that is unparalleled by many films today. The use of Steadicam in Kubrick's The Shining is something I'll always remember so fondly of but that technology wasn't even invented by the 70's. Instead, Barry Lyndon showcases numerous sequences depicting the lush countryside-esque landscape that the story is set in and makes use of natural lighting in both indoor and outdoor scenes. It's important to note the indoor parts as the visuals for the interior scenes also look amazing and detailed. Many of the scenes that take place in a house or some building are lit by candles, which would easily be a detriment to the visuals but works well in this case. Pausing the film during these moments of great cinematography would be the same thing as looking at a painting because they really resembled the looks of an actual piece. The framing, with its double shots and closeups, are also nothing short of perfection, as they keep the focus on the subjects whenever necessary while being mindful of the background.The story of Barry Lyndon is essentially a man's journey from rags to riches. Having this premise also be a period piece can be challenging because it imposes a lot of standards on the audience to believe in to be able to fully enjoy the film. I really liked it though, and this has to do with the presentation. I've said enough about the cinematography but the music and acting are also deserving of the praise they receive. I myself don't have a favorite actor or performance from this film because I felt like all of them kind of blended together and helped with the overall world-building, which is good.Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this film also has an intermission, which I appreciated. Barry Lyndon is three hours long, and while I very much enjoyed the film in its entirety, I did feel the runtime by the time it was over. This also has to do with how the second part of the movie slows down, as it's in charge of steering the story towards the end. The intermission got me thinking a bit about modern films, especially because ones that are 2.5+ hours long are going to be made for as long as film exists. I definitely wouldn't mind having intermissions for newer movies and I'm curious as to why we don't really see them anymore. It's one thing to absorb everything that's happening on screen in one long sitting but making a film built around segmented parts with an intermission might make for a more easier movie-going experience these days. Having a short pause midway though might help the audience take a minute to reflect on everything that's happened and that's definitely something I did while watching Barry Lyndon which prepared me for the rest of the film.One of Kubrick's best, but The Shining is still my favorite. Thank god for John Alcott.",Barry Lyndon
255,ryanwmullally,A Brilliant Work of Art,10,16 August 2018,"Barry Lyndon, directed by my hero, Stanley Kubrick, is probably one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in my life. Despite Jaws, I don't think there is an other experience I had watching a film than this. Almost ever single frame of this movie can be painting. It's art come to life. I think 2001: A Space Odyssey and Barry Lyndon are Kubrick's masterpieces. I don't understand how this isn't ranked up with Citizen Kane, Goodfellas, or The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Story is about an young Irish man named Redmond Barry living in 18th century Ireland. When he kills an English soldier in a duel, he must leave until the steam blows off. From there, Redmond Barry goes on all sorts of adventures through Europe. Then he meet a rich English lady named Lady Lyndon. They fall in love and marry, and Redmond Barry becomes Barry Lyndon. He soon becomes the emporer of England, but Lady Lyndon's son think he's only marrying her for her money, and tension grows between him and Barry throughout the years that result in a shot off leg.This film basically tells the same story as Citizen Kane. Charles Foster Kane and Redmond Barry both start off as nobodies, and they then become the richest people of their day, and then they realize it's not the answer.This film needs to be seen.

Barry Lyndon is an epic, beautifully penciled story of opportunism, meticulously calculated revenge, and ultimately, self-destruction.

257,Barry_the_Baptist,Great Kubrick twist on the costume genre.,8,10 July 2002,"The film is visually flawless, and its scenic beauty is shaped and manipulated very well by Stanley Kubrick. The plot is of little consequence, a simple rise and fall story which Kubrick tries to add flare and satire too. His attention to symmetry, lighting, and cinematography is impeccable. However it lacks that feeling of bold experimentation and excitement that is found in his more well-known films such as ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""A Space Odyssey"". It is definitely not the most interesting Kubrick film simply because the material was not as strong or moving. Yet the Kubrickan elements found in all his works are portrayed with great effort in ""Barry Lyndon"". Kubrick works within the genre to make a more unconventional comment on the aristocracy of the times and primal human nature in us all throughout all walks of life. Kubrick uses the actors as mere pawns of their social and natural barriers. It is a period film without significant love interest or much action, a rare thing in the genre. This works to add a twist to the often stuffy and trivial crap that most period films put forward. Kubrick had a greater design for the film as opposed making a by the numbers costume drama. Not his finest but a must for all Kubrick fans and someone interested on a different and interesting take on the genre.",Barry Lyndon
258,wkbeason,A painting come to life...,10,24 June 2002,"There has never been a film as beautiful to behold as Barry Lyndon.  It is the greatest purely visual achievement you'll ever see.  I'm not taking about special effects (this is anything but an ""action"" flick).  I'm talking about capturing true beauty beautifully on film.  But Kubrick accomplishes much more with his period piece than brilliant cinematography.  He places the viewer *into* the eighteenth century.  You are living it.  The pace of the film is (almost painfully) slow at times but, you see, so was the life of the times.  Many scenes offer the viewer no dialogue at all because this was a time when the gesture, the look, the subtle formality communicated far more than the spoken word.  A sharp contrast to today's ""fast and furious"" approach to film-making (and pace of life for that matter).  A film to savor rather than devour.  A spectacle in a class by itself.",Barry Lyndon
259,Mourn-2,Kubrick's Finest Film,10,7 December 1999,"As big a fan of Stanley Kubrick as I am, I can find something flawed in each of his films save Barry Lyndon.  Where some see slow pacing and wooden characters, I see brilliant devices that Kubrick used in order to prevent the undermining of the purely sensory elements of this film.  Visually, it is unparalleled to this day, even by such recent masterworks as The English Patient or other classics such as Lawrence of Arabia.  The matching of the soundtrack to the action on film is so exquisite as to defy description, almost as if each frame of the the film is blended with each note of the music.  The performances, while understated, are still excellent, including leads Ryan O'Neal (Whom I do not like in any other movie) and Marisa Berenson as Lady Lyndon (The courtship scene between these two is perfect). Also, some of the more minor characters are very well portrayed, such as Captain Potzdorf, Lord Bullington and the Chevalier.This is quite simply Stanley Kubrick's finest film.  Yes, it is a large investment of time.  But if you choose to participate and let the film draw you in, those three hours are well spent.  And while it is not a traditional action movie, if the last duel scene doesn't draw you in and captivate you, you need to check your pulse.  It ranks right up there with the Dennis Hopper/Christopher Walken scene in True Romance as one of the greatest single scenes in the history of cinema.  Do not let the few outspoken critics of this movie sway your opinion and cause you to miss out on the pure beauty of this film, see it.",Barry Lyndon

Now its not often that I don't watch a film through but, unfortunately, this was one. I struggled through 'part one' then turned off the machine somehow feeling that I had lost a large proportion of my life! Undeniably beautiful to look at (but not for three hours...) astonishingly wooden acting by some (whatever was Ryan O'Neil doing in there?), seriously corny and intrusive musical score (God! That corny Irish theme!! and couldn't the army bandsmen play anything but British Grenardiers?), poorly scripted and unnecessarily detailed to the point of tedium.

But this movie blew me away--the story line, cinematography, scenery, narration, costumes, acting, everything was just wonderful. There was a lot of publicity building up to the movie because Kubrick was using Marisa Berenson, a top model with little to no acting experience, who did a terrific job as Lady Lyndon. Ryan O'Neal was also pretty good, his Irish accent wasn't too bad.For some reason, Barry Lyndon was rarely shown on TV & I had to buy the DVD so I could watch it a few times a year.

262,ghostninjafire,A movie seen as a painting,10,29 September 2013,"This film is to be seen as a painting of the eighteenth century. The characters are merely models in an art gallery. During three long hours they limit themselves to pose while most of the narrative moves off camera, evolving through the words of the narrator. And where is the genius of it all? To see it just think about the story and reflect on how it invites to be told. It's almost a story of musketeers that 90% of directors would have accelerated, florid and embellished with sword duels romantic scenes, grand statements (love, hatred, revenge ...) and boatloads of emotion. Kubrick went for a completely different path. If you want to see the story it has to be on his terms - as a still life that hardly communicates anything that yourself have to create the thrill of fitting in the frame that you have in front of eyes. Pure cinema. Its natural beauty will leave you speechless.",Barry Lyndon

Nice costumes, of course, but really just a depressing, boring film.",Barry Lyndon
264,ConallMcCormick,The Fantastic Character of Barry Lyndon,10,23 October 2021,"A common complaint I hear about ""Barry Lyndon"" is that it has a poor protagonist. Firstly, that he is one-dimensional. I feel that people don't understand the beauty and depth of him and what he represents. Secondly- that he is unsympathetic. On this count, there is much to discuss.I am deeply sympathetic to Barry in part one. At the start of the film, Barry loses his father to a duel. This has a major impact on Barry and makes him so stunted, immature and reckless due to the lack of a paternal presence. As a young man he is naively and innocently in love with his more savvy cousin. However, his love is betrayed by his cousin who cynically (probably) looked for the captain for wealth and prestige, denying their history.Barry is an honourable man in part 1 and seeks satisfaction for pride and for love. Barry is then tricked by his extended family (including surrogate father- his uncle) to leave. He is robbed (by father/son highwaymen) and forced to conscript into the army. There, he learns that he was tricked and realises that he has signed his life away to the army, is trapped in their, and has lost his love. Grogan (another surrogate father) is killed in his first battle. His lost love, and his loss of innocence during the 7 years war, is what will breed the cynicism within him. It's why the poster has a rose being stepped on by a gun. Kubrick loves exploring the theme of war and loss of innocence: ""Paths of Glory"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". However, he doesn't do it better than in Barry Lyndon, in my opinion.His cynicism grows through his conscription into the Prussian army after an attempted desertion from the British army. He had naively hoped to return home to Ireland due to his homesickness. Instead, he faces greater cruelty under Captain Pozdorf (another surrogate father) forcing him to burst into tears when he finally meets the Chevalier. This is, perhaps, the peak of our sympathies toward him (at least in part one). It is him who acts as the main surrogate father figure for Barry in the film but breeds the rogue within him. Naturally, this is where he cynically seduces Lady Lyndon and loses the sympathy of the audience.Part 2 we feel no sympathy for Barry. He cheats on Lady Lyndon and treats her poorly. He viciously beats Bullington. He squanders ""a fine family fortune"" for selfish gain. Ultimately, his hatred for Bullington bubbles over and his horrendous beating in the chamberoom destroys any hope of not only gaining the Lyndon title but of any relationship with high society again. It is here Barry hits another major low points- he deserves this but still commands sympathy. However, with his son's death this is what destroys him completely. Especially given how he had no father, how he lost his love, lost his standing, suffered in war his son was EVERYTHING he had left. Thus, leads him to stuporous depression and alcoholism. It is here that Barry's sympathy is retained fully for me. Finally, Barry hands Bullington his shot honourably in the duel. However, it is too late for forgiveness. Bullington shoots him anyway but still allows him an annuity.Before concluding Barry's story. I think that it is a good idea to review other aspects of the film.When I first saw ""Barry Lyndon"" I loved Part one more than part two. Why? Because it's so incredibly dynamic without being contrived. He absurdly ends up married to Lady Lyndon after a painstaking journey originating with his cousin Nora with each step in the journey taking an unexpected twist. Barry is chaos personified, it's what allows him to succeed in his entropic life and garner his fortune in the first place. However, it also what makes him lose it.Part two comes to a screeching halt as Barry tries to adapt to high society but ultimately fails. What is interesting is Kubrick's great reflective ability in his work reminiscent of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Barry achieved social acceptance by winning a boxing match in the British army (I.e., 'low society'), however, it his spectacular brawl with Bullington that condemns him in high society. Additionally, the film is framed by its duels. His father's death begins the film, Barry's duel kickstarts the film, and Barry's duel with Bullington concludes the film.It is a fatalistic film. Firstly, this is due to the narration that documents Barry's life in objective/non-judgemental fashion. Secondly, the way the film is shot to look like a Rococo/Baroque painting being examined from a medium shot before zooming out to a wide shot with Barry. To me, the film makes Barry seem like a zoo attraction. It is uncomfortable to me that we are able to scrutinise, judge and gain such a complete access to someone's life like this. Lastly, people complain that Barry is a passive protagonist but this is by intention. This leads onto the films nihilistic/existentialist/absurdist theme and the films ending for Barry.The film ends with Barry lost a leg, lost his son, his title, wife and lands. The camera zooms in for the first time rather than out symbolising the finality of his life as he enters his carriage to live an unsuccessful return to gambling.As the title sequence says at the end:""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarreled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now""It is a nihilistic/existentialist ending as whatever we might think of Barry's character we can say that he is made equal in death. Would I say Barry is a good man? No. He is good in parts, saving Grogan in the battle, being a good father, having mercy on Bullington. Would I say he is bad? No. He is bad in parts, treatment of his wife and adopted son. I would say he is neutral to me and really sums up humanity so extraordinarily well.As David Hume said in his argument against heaven and hell and it's moral allocation:""But the greatest part of mankind float betwixt vice and virtue.""This is Barry Lyndon.",Barry Lyndon
265,Ross16,Beautiful Cinematography,8,23 August 2008,"Barry Lyndon is a film often overlooked within the Kubrick filmography due to its serious and slow-paced undertones. It is these undertones, however that help to build up the film into a work of art that inspires possibly only the most devoted of film enthusiasts. This film should be viewed as many have suggested as such, an artistic portrayal of a period long romanticised, yet scarcely interpreted with such loyalty and devotion to the screen. Whilst Barry Lyndon remains among the greatest works of modern cinema, it is one, whose viewing must only be conquered by the most passionate of film-goers, if it is ever to be truly appreciated. It accomplishes that which few films are capable of, in bringing pure life onto the screen. Perhaps only rivalled by the select few other masterpieces of cinema, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a life epic, which leaves the viewer shaken and inspired. It is a film with the power to leave the viewer standing upon a whole new perspective of life, one which told through the neutral story of Redmond Barry provokes pure sorrow and depression within the heart of the viewer. This is not a movie to watch when you want to see a ""Shining"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" type of action.....Barry Lyndon is a very detailed period story featuring all the peaks and setting pace of a book. This is a perfect movie to have an intermission with, to help you regroup and be engrossed in the story. THe dramatic highs (Jonathan Quinn duel, War, Gambling, Fight, and later duels) feature some of the finest work (Acting, camera work, directing) ever put on film. This movie took me 2 viewings or so to get, and I've seen it maybe 5-6 times now, and I can tell you, Barry Lyndon quickly moved up to the top of my movie list. It's a must see (at least twice). The acting is phenomenal, the movie is a labor of love, the cinematography is beautiful, the sets/lighting is amazing. It's hard to believe this movie is 30+ yrs old and is virtually unknown except to the Kubrick faithful. This is a MUST SEE!",Barry Lyndon
266,joshuwon,Easily Worth A Thousand Viewings,10,26 May 2002,"Some people may complain about the slower pacing of ""Barry Lyndon"". They are missing the point : this film is not about moving from plot point A to plot point B in the most efficient way possible - you want that, go see a Ron Bass movie. ""Barry Lyndon"", unlike many movies which trip all over themselves to twist the audiences expectations, does take it's time; but it is for the journey that we must embark. Every character, every set, every line of dialog, every frame has been touched by a craftsman unequaled in his lifetime. From the highly detailed production design to the flowery, and at times, comical dialog Kubrick has created a true vision of life in aristocratic Europe. Everything in this movie is perfect. It could almost be a documentary.But instead of celebrating the chivalry and heroism of the period, Kubrick peels away the layers of legend to reveal the true nature of kings and generals. He satirically castigates royalty and soldiers alike as petty and decadent rogues, who pay lip service to honor while stealing all they can to support their lifestyle (or ""the manner with which they'd become accustomed""). And Barry, being from humble roots, is all too eager to play the game in exchange for a place at the table. The film is both a literary and visual masterpiece. The former is likely due to the abilities of W.M. Thacker who wrote the book upon which the movie was based. Only a novel could be so rich in detailed subplot while maintaining it's overall theme. The latter, is all Kubrick - always a visual genius, the man invented a new lens system so he could film the whole thing with natural light. Amazing. At certain points in the movie, you will be wondering if that river or meadow in the background is a matte painting or if, in fact, a place that scenic does indeed exist.I've seen the movie three or four times, I watch key scenes over and over again. To me, it's one of the funniest movies ever made. The fact that Kubrick, with his dedication to truth and reality and meaningful storytelling, directed it, also makes it one of the best",Barry Lyndon

268,edimihalescu,Truely one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen,9,19 July 2021,"As far as cinematography, production-design, costumes, make-up and hairstyling go, this movie is my favourite of all time. All the stills are gorgeous, every scene is beautifully lit( especially those lit only by candle light), and overall, this movie doesn't seem like a commercial movie, created by a studio in order to obtain profit from it, but it much rather strikes me as a carefuly crafted and drawn motion picture from one of the greatest artists who has ever lived, and my personal favourite film-maker of all time, Stanley Kubrick!This might actually be my second favourite Kubrick movie of all time, after 2001: a space oddysey. And while that movie is widely remembered and discussed about to this day, it really is a shame people don't remember this movie as well as they do other Kubrick masterpieces, such as 2001, The shining, or A clockwork orange. On one hand I get it, this movie isn't as compelling as the others, the deeper meaning isn't really there, and overall its message simply doesn't present the same level of complexity as the aforementioned movies. Those are perhaps some of the reasons why I am giving this movie a 9/10, and not a 10/10, but overall I just love this movie, and i wish it got more recognition.",Barry Lyndon

270,Dwolvesbane,A fantastic invocation of the 18th century.,10,22 November 2008,"Barry Lyndon may be one of the least popular of all of Stanley Kubrick's films, but it is by no means deserving of this reputation. This historical epic explores an era in Europe that is often overshadowed in America by the events of the so called French and Indian War (which was in all actuality an extension of the seven years war that is portrayed in the film) and the subsequent American Revolution. Although it follows the life of one man it touches on many issues that were highly relevant in those days, especially the very Candide- like way that Barry finds himself in a military career. Overall the film goes a great distance to evoke the feel of the late 18th century and archives this end spectacularly.The term ""Costume Epic"" finds in this film perhaps its most astounding fulfillment. Indeed, one of Barry Lyndon's most notable features is the extensive and beautiful costuming. Not only are the styles and make-up of the period represented, but there is a lovely treatment of the military uniforms and equipment used during the Seven Years War.The stunning cinematography, and of course the famously candlelit scenes, deserve mention. The locations used in the film are stunning to say the least, with broad country vistas and rich noble villas presented in a style reminiscent of painters of the 18th and 19th centuries. The candlelit scenes are both technically and visually impressive, and go a long way towards capturing the feel of the period.The story itself oftentimes seems secondary to the visual splendor of the film, but is of good quality in and of itself. It is not tremendously innovative, as many other Kubrick films are, in terms of content, but the story is told well. Narration is put to excellent effect, giving the whole film the book-like feel that can be found quite often in Kubrick's films.Overall, though it is easy to overlook as a part of his career, Barry Lyndon deserves a place among the most notable of Kubrick's achievements, right along with films like A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, if only for its invocation of its temporal setting alone.",Barry Lyndon
271,Olive-3,BBC TV Makes Better Period Pieces Than This,1,9 February 1999,"I revisited ""Barry Lyndon"" after 25 years and found 3 hrs of pretty pictures and wooden characters - not one involving personality. 25 years ago I probably thought this was ""art"" - now it's boring crap , it's safe to say, since the wretched auteur theory was debunked. Film historians have recently discovered screenwriters and are dragging out elderly scribes for that ""last"" interview about the Golden Age of Hollywood. Hitchcock actually used screenwriters, can you imagine? BBC actually does Thackeray better, because TV is character driven.",Barry Lyndon
272,DylanFan,2001 for the 18th Century,10,18 March 1999,"I have long since admired the work of Stanley Kubrick because he was able to capture the essence of every idea that he took on. In ""2001"" we, the viewer, got the chance to glimpse at the future as if the film where a documentary. In ""Dr. Strangelove"" Mr. Kubrick had us laughing all the way to the end of the world. But what Mr. Kubrick was able to achieve with 1975's ""Barry Lyndon"" is every bit as breathtaking and haunting as ""2001"" or any of his other films for that matter. It's not so much that one watches ""Barry Lyndon"" as the film washes over you, truly making you feel that it is 18th Century England. ""Barry Lyndon"" is not an easy film to watch for those with short attention spans or are unfamiliar with the works Mr. Kubrick because the film is a long, labourous journey. The film, which is 185 minutes long, is about a young man named Redmond Barry (played by a rather stiff but effective Ryan O'Neal) who yearns to crawl out of his poor Irish home and seek fame and fortune aboard. A duel fought over a women with a British officer forces Barry to flee and so his adventure begins. He ends up in both the English and the Prussian armies, fights in the Seven Years War, works as a spy and then marries the lovely Lady Lyndon. But this upwordly-mobile young man is doomed from the start and slowly his plans of grandeur dissolve into an abyss of despair and shame. Mr. Kubrick went to painstaking details in order to recreate the feel of the times (he used real costumes from the period, natural candlelight and actual houses of the age) and he passes with flying colors. This film embodies all that Mr. Kubrick had to say about about human nature and man's destiny (see ""2001"", ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Full Metal Jacket""). The former Redmond Barry was doomed from the start to end up at the beginning. Rest in peace, Stanley.",Barry Lyndon
273,tugrul-anildi,nice but superficial,7,29 December 2013,"Definitely not a masterpiece if we must do justice to movies deserving the title. First of all, Lady Lyndon has absolutely no character even a superficial one. We have no notion of her feelings towards her husband and her second son. Secondly, the main character has no dilemmas, conflicts not even a soul. Thirdly, the story consists of disconnected parts without aim. Fourthly; Barry's mother reappears as a lady after disappearing as an ordinary villager at the start of he movie. There are many other weaknesses besides these. The result is a historical setting, carefully set-up scenes, some good music but no content. Can not be compared with other Kubrick movies such as The Shining and 2001",Barry Lyndon

275,muertos,My favorite Kubrick!,10,26 January 2005,"So being a Kubrick fan is a trendy thing these days (and has been for quite a while), but you can always spot someone who's not that serious about it when they tick off their favorites (invariably 2001, Clockwork Orange, and Dr. Strangelove) and omit any mention of Barry Lyndon. It may not be the best Kubrick, but it's probably my favorite of all of them.Ironically Thackeray's book, which was written as comedy/satire, was not really an epic. Stanley obviously thought otherwise! For three hours we move up (and then back down) the social ladder in 18th century Europe, along the way getting to see a loquacious highwayman, a battle in the Seven Years War, Hardy Krueger as (shockingly!) a German military officer, a lot of people in chalky makeup with beauty marks, Leon Vitali puke, and a Marisa Berenson hairstyle that's got to have a ""wingspan"" of 18 inches. Kubrick rivets together the somewhat rambling plot line with two duels which he places at the beginning and ending of the film, one comic, the other harrowing and disturbing. He also does a neat job of turning the tables and turns the hero into the villain and elevates the twitchy Lord Bullingdon (Vitali) as the true hero, despite portraying him earlier in the film as a sniveling coward--an outcome that even Thackeray probably wouldn't have seen coming! The real star of Barry Lyndon is the visual look. After seeing this film you will never again see an 18th/19th century period piece the same way again, because after this film, done entirely in natural light and candlelight, the blaze of modern electric lights on studio sets will be all the more glaring. Every frame of this movie is as meticulously designed as an 18th century oil painting. That's Kubrick for you. The torture that he and his cast and crew must have gone through to get all of this stuff right is the viewer's windfall. I can't take my eyes off Barry Lyndon. Clearly a masterpiece, and criminally underrated.",Barry Lyndon
276,Nyagtha,The Perfect Film.,10,18 October 2001,"I once upset a friends father regarding his love for Charlton Heston. However I found out he loved this film. As not only a genuine claim but also an attempt to breach peace I said with complete sobriety and beleif; ""Barry Lyndon is the perfect film"".Without looking up from his newspaper and without a pause for thought, he responded with; ""It is the perfect film."" Aurally, visually, heart achingly, there is a beauty in not only the film's appearence, but even its dialogue will wipe you out; ""Will I go to Heaven?"" The characters will carry you with them through love, hate and THAT SOUNDTRACK!!! Kubrick is the master of perfection and he never quite beat this.Coinciding with the relase of Jaws it didn't do as well as it should (understatement) and Kubrick was undeservingly destroyed. If a film ever deserved to be seen by everyone, this is it.",Barry Lyndon
277,easeltine,Boring,5,31 July 2013,"A beautiful movie, beautiful scenes, beautiful costumes, and beautiful music. I saw it on the big screen when it came out. I think it was 1976 that I saw the movie the first and last time. Now, I actually own 2002 Space Oddessey, I think that the movie was made in 1968, and my wife and daughter hate the movie and find it sooo boring that it beats ""Remains of the Day"" out on the most boring movie ever list for them. My daughter has not seen this movie and I am now thinking of getting it from Netflix to get her reaction of what number she would place it on her list as the Most Boring Movies of all time. One person on the Internet had this as his 19th movie choice as the Most Boring movie ever. The movie drags on and on. The movie might also relate to the how people felt about America and politics in 1976. Nobody has thought of this relationship.I do not like the one scene where Barry Lyndon is in the bar fondling the woman's nipples on his lap. Acting is only fair by Ryan O'Neal in this movie, I did not find the acting that special. On an on this movie goes. I was glad it was over in 1976...and really have not missed seeing it since then.",Barry Lyndon
278,dawidbleja,"As with many Kubrick films, the use of light and music are fantastic.",9,6 March 2002,"I never thought that I'd be the sort of person to come out of a film raving about the use of light. But, to my surprise, after seeing Barry Lyndon, I am. As in most Kubrick films, the use of light is unbelievable. Almost every scene is so expertly and beautifully lit. Lighting is something you can usually ignore in a film, but after only a little examination of it in Barry Lyndon, you realise what a profound influence on the film it can have.
Kubrick wanted this film to be as faithful to the era as possible, so he ordered that all of the costumes be meticulously designed in complete accordance with not only the techniques of the period, but the fabrics. As a result, they no longer look like costumes, but like clothes - it's a big difference.Also to make the film seem realistic, Kubrick used only natural/candle light. It makes sense if you think about it. There was no electric light at the time, yet in all other period films, that's how everything is lit up (as opposed to how it actually looked). The difference is phenomenal (just think how different the light is in a lit room compared to outside in the daylight). As a result, the actors aren't mercislessly covered in light, but bask in it.In one scene, set in a large hall, the set is lit up exclusively by candles - from chandeliers, from along the walls, from on the tables). In such indoor scenes, you've probably never seen actors' faces lit by anything other than overhead electric lights. Here, they are lit from the side with a much softer, orange light, and the effect is surprisingly refreshing. Due to the lack of intense brightness that candles produce in such a large room, Kubrick had to specially modify his camera. He took a camera that had not been manufactured anymore for years, broke it apart, and got NASA (!!!) to modify it for him. The result was a camera that had an f-stop (I think it was f-stop) that was higher than any cameras being used even today! And this was all just for one few-minute-long scene! And this insane perfectionism had serious results! The use of music in this film is about as breathtaking as I've ever seen/heard in any film - And I'm not usually a big fan of classical music! One scene (a crescendo-ing sequence of scenes actually) is, because of the way it is fit with music, one of the most profound and beautiful scenes I've ever seen. Fans of Martin Scorsese might be interested to see Barry Lyndon, because - if I'm not mistaken - this is Scorsese's favourite film.",Barry Lyndon
279,blanks,the most underrated film ever made!!!,10,20 October 2000,"On release, Barry Lyndon was critically savaged for no real good reason, some even saying that the film was too beautiful. although critics are more correct then you would usually think in most cases, in this case however they couldn't have been more incorrect.One certainly wonders why it was so picked upon, in fact I havent a clue why as this is simply one of cinema's finest achievements. After Dr strangelove, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange, three more of the finest by the man himself, Stanley Kubrick. You could be forgiven if you had doubts whether he could do it a fourth time, thanks to John Alcott's amazing, rich cinematography, Ken Adam's note perfect production design and of course Stanley Kubrick's exciting, brilliant, matchless direction, this is simply gripping and exhilarating to watch, every frame dripping with pure class, the screenplay finely honed, sensible, realistic and the performances surprisingly excellent, especially Ryan O Neal who in other films like Walter Hill's The Driver is rather bland, but here his potential is realised a hundred fold.But Marisa Berenson also scores as his wife giving a subtle engaging performance giving justice to the story, the script and the direction.Based on a minor Thackeray novel, the story under Kubrick's masterful touch becomes anything but minor which follows O Neal's adventurer Redmond Barry who as an army deserter rises to the top of high society by marrying Mrs Lyndon ( Berenson ) but due to his greed falls slowly to the bottom. Together with the Godfather Part 2, Barry Lyndon is perhaps the ultimate cinematic statement of how power and greed corrupt and thanks to Kubrick who also adapted the script meshes together this important theme with the visual splendor to achieve a perfectly balanced, atmospheric three dimensional effect that is often staggering and heart poundingly gripping to watch. Perhaps the best example of this is when the circumstances of Redmond's greed catch up with him and he takes part in a duel with his son in law, not only does the pure brilliance and the perfect co ordination of the scene blow you away, it's the sheer suspense of wanting to know what happens to Barry next as despite his greed is still an human and most of us would do the same if given the chance and we deep down know it. Winning oscars deservedly for it's photography, art direction, costumes and adapted score, there can be doubt of it's sheer brilliance, a film manages to be different from Kubrick's others, substituting his trademark icy intelligence for a more suitable emotional warmth, this is undoubtedly his most moving picture, together with A Clockwork Orange this is a great contender for the honour of his best picture but most importantly, ignore the critics, it's an utterly unmissable epic of the finest kind, in fact as Barry Norman said "" it's the most beautiful film i can remember "" too right.",Barry Lyndon
280,joaodelauraaurora,Kubrick's perfect portrait of Lyndon's rise and fall,9,8 January 2002,"`Barry Lyndon' is a delight for the eyes and the ears: the XVIII century landscapes are exquisite in their colors and light; the indoor sets, with perfect decoration and costume design, are marvelous to the minutest nuances; and the music, from Bach to Schubert, is sublime. But what is most impressive in Kubrick's movie is his capacity to convey melancholy and inexorability to portray the tragic story of Thackeray's anti-hero Barry Lyndon, a gifted but poor Irishman who will impersonate different roles, crossing several countries and facing continuous disenchantment, only to meet his gloomy fate in the end. The deliberate subdued acting, the narrator's subtle irony and detachment, Ryan O'Neal's sad eyes and impassive face and, most of all, the slowpacing of both editing and acting, all converge to provide a sense of grief and doom that mark this masterpiece. Kubrick's genius can be better observed by the way he conceives of and stages the three duels that are the turning points of the story. `Barry Lyndon' is the ultimate example of how a movie with a conventional, linear narrative can be brilliant in its own way (9/10).",Barry Lyndon

For 20 years now I have sticked to having only four 10/10 movies that immediately come to my mind : Barry Lyndon, Amadeus, Lawrence of Arabia and Elephant Man.

I quickly became infatuated with Kubrick and quickly searched out his other films to watch.I soon rented ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""2001"".  I couldn't get enough of this director!  Everything I watched that he created was fantastic and I knew that I would love everything that this man made.  That was until I rented ""Barry Lyndon"" during that same time, and witnessed what I thought was his first triumphant failure....I couldn't get into the movie at all and I distinctly remember not watching the entire thing.  I considered it the cost of a rental thrown down the drain.How young and stupid I was....I tried the film again, sometime around 1993 (13 years later).

Barry Lyndon was one that I had not heard of before and from inquiries, found that few people had heard of it either. Not knowing it that was I good or bad thing, I picked up the film and gave it a watch. What I found was one of the few films I have ever given a perfect rank. The film grants sumptuous viewing from start to finish with perfectly framed and elegant shots, stunning costumes and fine acting. Know that this is not like any other Kubrick (which is partly why I believe it's relatively looked over), but that his trademark brilliance is there. His perfectionism permeates the film and of course creates the only possible outcome - something perfect. In spite of none of the characters being necessarily likable (there are anti-heroes and villains abound) they resonate greatly, bringing much emotion to the film. The scenery also is beautiful; even in the film's slowest moments one can not pull one's eyes from the screen. Kubrick has certainly created a work of brilliance in this one and it may perhaps be one of his best films. If you do enjoy Kubrick's body of work, be sure and find yourself a copy.

Although I am generally not drawn to period costume dramas, the protagonist played by Ryan O'Neal is complex. While he is certainly a cheat, a liar, a deserter, and has many more negative qualities, he also displays LOVE, courage and compassion at times. Sometimes when you least expect it because you know what a thoroughly dishonorable scoundrel he is.  And since the movie is also a study of the times as much as a study of a man, I have thought for a long time that Kubrick should have simply titled the movie "" The Life and Times "", rather than the more cryptic "" Barry Lyndon "".",Barry Lyndon
291,1-0,Great film for misanthropes,8,18 November 2015,"Barry Lyndon, 18th Century gadabout, is an idiot. Like the Count Bullingdon says in the movie, he's a ""common opportunist"", and it's kind of amazing he succeeded as well as he did. Barry gave little to the world— only took. He lied when convenient, and abandoned when the going got tough. Even when he might have righted his course and made something of himself, Barry ducked out to chase more exciting (though less legitimate) prospects. As I get older, it becomes impossible to sympathize with the character, and yet the film about him seems no less great, no less significant.Stanley Kubrick's directorial follow-up to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (after a failed attempt to make a feature based on Napoleon) offers little of the visceral excitement of the previous movie, and even less of the cosmic significance of the one before that (1968's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), but is nevertheless one of the legendary director's great films. BARRY LYNDON is based on an 1844 novel by William Makepeace Thackeray, charting the development (and eventual demise) of a young upstart originally known as Redmond Barry— from his humble beginnings as a dim-witted Irish country boy, to his misadventures in English high society. How Barry gets from one place to the other is the plot of the movie, and as much as I cringe at the character's various life decisions, Kubrick's pacing (and gorgeous period imagery) keeps me glued into this movie throughout its generous duration.Since the movie is so well made, it's easier to forgive the fact that the title character is basically a scourge to society. Ryan O'Neal's Barry is a mildly charming parasite, offering no real concession to endearment to the audience (or his fictional peers), other than a vague, naive charisma, and occasional personal victories along the way to ruin. I don't feel particularly bad spoiling that Barry's end is a tragic one, because Kubrick's arc for the movie is almost precisely 50% rise and 50% fall, which means a brutal, extended descent for viewers. Maybe you have to be a misanthrope to really love this movie, or maybe it's just fun to watch people fail so spectacularly. Either way, the film succeeds in spite of its downwardly spiraling story.Big wins for this movie include: - Good acting. O'Neal has sometimes been criticized for his performance (including suspect Irish accent), but in my view, he plays Barry very well, right down to the s**t-eating, vacant charm. Hardy Kruger (as the Prussian Captain Potsdorf) is also great, and in the scenes between his character and O'Neal's, comes off as both very intelligent, and equally open to ambiguous corruption. Very Kubrick, really, and the entire cast serves its purpose to a tee. - Great cinematography. Famously, Kubrick used only lighting that would have been possible in the late 18th Century, which means candle-lit shots and gorgeous, widescreen landscapes of England and Ireland. - Great period score, including pieces by Handel, Vivaldi and traditional Irish folk music played by the Chieftans. Handel's ""Sarabande"" in particular features so heavily in the film as to seem a supporting characterThings about BARRY LYNDON that *might* make it hard to love: - Not only is O'Neal's Barry not smart or particularly interesting, he's also not well-liked. Most of the movie finds him succeeding through sheer dumb luck or opportunism, while his observers notice and (justifiably) resent his fate. Barry's not even a good underdog, because he gets MANY chances to right his way, but manages to screw them all up. - It's a long movie, 3 Hours, 4 minutes. And it's a slow one too, though that could be considered one of its strengths, if you consider how close to ""period"" Kubrick tried to make this movie. Still, as a viewer, you need to be in this for the long haul if you want to extract its charms.All of that said, I've loved BARRY LYNDON from the first time I saw it. Of course, I'm a Kubrick fan, and his senses of pacing and sly, black humor are all over the film. His movies (discounting anything starring Kirk Douglas) don't typically offer heroic protagonists, and this one's no different. The magic is in the exquisitely dark story, and of course, the beauty of the visuals and music. I rank this movie behind only 2001 and PATHS OF GLORY in Kubrick's canon, and recommend it whole-heartedly to neophyte Kubrick fans, or anyone into great black comedy.",Barry Lyndon

294,cinephiliac,Bizarre.,4,30 June 2005,"Kubrick was a masterful director. I personally adore both 2001 and The Shining - as close to cinematic perfection as you can come - and there is a lot to admire in the style and controversy of A Clockwork Orange, too. However, even the greatest directors make mistakes, and this was Kubrick's second (his first being Lolita). This lavish period piece telling of the exploits of 18th Century Irishman Barry Lyndon has little to recommend it beyond the helmer's name.Technically, there is some accomplished work in terms of composition of shot and the deliberate imitation of a past style of painting. As a film, though, Barry Lyndon is a variously tortuous and unrewarding watch - there are entertaining moments here and there, and nothing stands out as obviously bad, but neither does anything stand out as obviously great. It is as mediocre an experience as you could ask for - and running at close to three hours mediocre is not exactly called for. To say that it starts well and ends less well does not very well do it much of a service.But what do we ask of great directors? We ask for profundity, passion, insight, vision and excellence. None of these qualities are at all present in Barry Lyndon, a film without much point or energy, which is, in the end, overblown and rightly overlooked by the majority of film fans. Viewers looking for a Kubrick masterpiece would do well to avoid this one.",Barry Lyndon

'Irish rogue' he is supposed to portray, but O'Neal with his irritating yankee voice doesn't even try to act, he just stands around looking doe-eyed and dumb.
Not to mention the background 'music'. Guess the budget ran out, but silence is better than the endless monotony of two geeks listlessly torturing a recorder. My poor ears..

296,pschearer,"Barry Lyndon, Kubrick, exploitation and control",9,16 July 2005,"I am sorry that the 197 earlier comments here are just too many to read to see if anyone else has ever made this point before, but I suspect I might have an original perspective on Kubrick and on Barry Lyndon.Kubrick directed only ten films from ""Paths of Glory"" in 1957 to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in 1999. He had certain pet themes that he fit into his movies whenever he could. For example, telephones: the crucial call from the general to the artillery battery in ""Paths or Glory""; several key phone calls in ""Strangelove""; the charming video phone call from orbit to the cute little girl and the birthday call from earth to the Jupiter ship in ""2001""; and the telephone on the back of the tank in ""Full Metal Jacket"".But the dominant theme in all Kubrick's major films is one form or another of domination, manipulation, control, exploitation. Some of the examples are obvious: ultra-violence and brainwashing in ""Clockwork Orange"", slavery in ""Spartacus"". Others are more implicit: supernaturally induced madness in ""Shining""; boot camp and nightmarish combat in ""Full Metal Jacket""; obsession and seduction in ""Lolita"" or ""Eyes Wide Shut"". And on the grandest galactic scale, the manipulation of human evolution in ""2001"".So what about ""Barry Lyndon""? There are all kinds of manipulations and exploitations to be found in the plot, but ""Barry"" goes a huge step beyond these.-------- S P O I L E R S --------To explain... Thackeray and/or Kubrick have an artistic problem. They are telling the tale of a generally worthless human, so rotten that his own son challenges him to a duel, and Barry's only moral act in the entire three-hour movie is to refuse to shoot his son. The problem is multiplied for Kubrick by casting bland, white-bread Ryan O'Neal. Why should we care about Barry Lyndon at all?Yet somehow Thackeray/Kubrick make us care, if not for Barry, then at least for what happens to him. That is what great story-telling does. By the time of the father-son pistol duel, with its gut-wrenching tension, we really are concerned that one will kill the other and it might be the end of Barry Lyndon.So when Barry falls, we don't know if the wound is mortal or not. After Barry is lifted into a carriage and is driven off, the narrator says words to the effect of ""Nobody knows what became of Barry Lyndon. Some say he went to London and died in poverty, and some say he went to Paris and died a rich man. But none of it matters because they are all dead now"". But WAIT! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM!!Then I realized how silly that was of me. Barry and all the others in the story are fictional characters; none of them had ever been alive to begin with. The ultimate manipulation here is the storyteller's manipulation of his audience. I don't know if the role of puppet-master belongs to Thackeray or Kubrick or both in what proportion, but someone pulled a fast one on me and I loved it.",Barry Lyndon
297,overmatik,The definitive Kubrick masterpiece,10,13 April 2010,"By this time Kubrick had achieved anything a film maker could dream on achieve. He had roughly on his pocket 3 masterpieces of three different genres, and his last movie had cause hell in his personal life.So apparently Barry Lyndon came in a time when the director was looking for some peace of mind, and the picture really let's this feeling reach he audience. And this movie shows us so much of Kubrick talent, that is the ultimate testament to the man's genius.Barry Lyndon is the definition of what a real art movie must be, without any pretentiousness at all. Screenplay, Costume and Set Design, Acting and Directing were all in perfect balance. Each frame could become a picture on a wall.The movie is slow, yes, but this rhythm is essential to the story. We are following a man's life journey, there's no need to rush. The details are also worth of notice. I have never seen such care in details as with Barry Lyndon, everyone who worked on this gave it 100%.Must people will always remember Stanley for 2001 or Clockwork Orange, but to me no other production featured so much of what made him the ultimate perfectionist as Barry Lyndon.",Barry Lyndon
298,successtocrime,A Dream of Sorrow,10,23 May 2020,"The meticulous award-winning recreation of 18th century Europe, the eye-watering beauty of this film, the opulence, the spectacle of it all is just the framing of a sad human story. The character of Redmond Barry is that of an innocent, but not helpless young man who will do whatever it takes to achieve a gentlemanly status -- and loses it all through his own ungentlemanly behavior. It's not easy to deal with Ryan O'Neal in this role. He does his best, and his commitment to it is obvious but, well, he's still Ryan O'Neal. But he is supported by a flawless cast, I can't begin to enumerate them. I particularly liked Murray Melvin as the parson who is so offended by, and jealous of, the studly young suitor of his patroness. This is a story that is paced in a stately manner, not ""slow"" or ""static"". It's thoughtful, it's meant to be looked at, it's a tragedy without a trace of irony. Once séen it is unforgettable.",Barry Lyndon
299,The_Centurion,A Sprawling Period Piece from Stanley Kubrick,9,5 December 2007,"""Barry Lyndon"" is a three hour exposition into the life of an Irish commoner and social riser in 18th Century Europe. The film delves into great detail the events of his romantic youth through middle-age, and all the notable sidesteps along the way. The film depicts these happenings rather matter-of-factly, and doesn't cast bias one way or another on Barry (Ryan O'Neal). The viewer is free himself to decide whether they accept Barry as a gentleman ultimately, or merely a devious scoundrel.This is possibly the greatest period piece ever made, and another notch in the belt of cinema's finest director. Filmed in such a way as to present an aura of total authenticity, I almost felt as though I could have been watching a movie made in the 1700's. Kubrick's indelible presence could definitely be felt over this film, and you will never mistake his work for another's.The gentle pacing of this film may be lost on modern audiences hyped on CGI-porn, but there is a classic Kubrick moral woven within an elegant visual tapestry for those with the patience to bear it.",Barry Lyndon
300,Stig-4,"meticulous, sumptuous, perfection",10,5 August 1999,"Of all the genres Kubrick mastered, this period piece seems to be closest to his nature as a complete director. The craftsmanship in this film is breathtaking and flawless. The composition of shots, the lighting, sets, performances, and timing of the plot are unparalleled - even Visconti's sublime 'Il Gattopardo' seems grossly melodramatic and turgid in comparison. Each episode in Redmond Barry's life is so complete that it stands just as well alone as it compliments the arc of the plot. A timeless masterpiece - history will absolve this film from any naysayers, and prove it to be as great as 'Kane'.",Barry Lyndon
301,occjph,A film for film makers,10,19 September 2004,"This film is a landmark in cinematography for many reasons. First, the use of source lighting throughout the film - only natural light was used, no electrical lighting. Second, the absolute perfect framing of each and every scene, no matter how mundane. I defy anyone to step, frame by frame, through this film and see a single frame that could not be printed as a museum-grade image. It's that good. Exterior lighting was just as good as interior, with precise exposures matching the latitude of the film stocks available at the time.Many subsequent films have used source lighting (Amadeus comes to mind) with great results, but surely Kubrick was the first director to take this difficult production technique to this level. To achieve interior photography with nothing more than a few candles and perhaps some sunlight from a nearby window, Kubrick utilized a f0.7 lens developed by Perkin Elmer for spy satellite use. Cinema Products in Hollywood acquired this lens from Perkin Elmer and offered it to Kubrick after he inquired about very fast optics. CP modified a standard Mitchel BNC camera to accept this strange lens, building a special mount and grinding the aperture plate down to paper-thin thickness to permit the end element to focus on the emulsion on the BNC.One of the drawbacks of this special lens was an extremely shallow depth of field with wide open aperture settings. In the card gambling scene, shot entirely by candlelight, Kubrick had to instruct his actors to stay very still - not moving to or from the lens due to the focal length, which was 1 or 2 inches, maximum. It took many days and hundreds of takes to shoot the card scene, requiring the replacement of the candles every once in a while to maintain continuity.This is a film makers film - a film for photographers. While the story moves a bit slowly, the images captured are so well thought out and framed they overcome any shortcomings of the pace of the story. The use of classical music as a sonic background for the film was admirable, but this film is so well shot it stands above the soundtrack, like the finest silents of the 20's. The image is paramount.",Barry Lyndon
302,joberthefboom,Like stepping into a painting,8,11 June 2020,"'Barry Lyndon' isn't the first movie to come to mind when you think about Stanley Kubrick. But in a filmography of unique pictures this might be his most unique. Yes, the movie is rather long, but it has a certain flow to it that makes you forget the runtime. For three hours you see the story of a man who manages to gain everything he ever wanted and than, just as ruthlessly, lose it all.The viewer follows the endeavours of the Irish low born, Redmond Barry. He falls in love, but can't get the woman he desires. Forced to leave his home he joins the army. First as a soldier of the British army and than as a trusted pawn of the Prussian Army. By lack of a better word, luck befalls on him and he manages to obtain a title of nobility. A position, it turns out, he is unfit for. We see him mistreating his high born wife, fight with his stepson and squandering away almost all of his wife's fortune.'Barry Lyndon' is a three hour case study of an opportunistic man, ruthless and devious in getting what he wants, but who has no idea on how to keep it. Yet, we can't really dislike him for his dubious behaviour and we sympathize with him when things take a turn for the worse. He is no hero, but he isn't trying to be. He is just a human being.Then finally we arrive at the point that sets this movie apart from other films; the cinematography. Every shot seems to be constructed by the master as if it were a painting. Kubrick's greatest talent perhaps was making the highly artistic avant-garde accessible enough for the mainstream. Every bit of picturesque scenery creates the perfect atmosphere and gives the viewer the illusion that it was all carefully crafted by some of the finest painters throughout history. It might be the biggest achievement in cinematography ever put to film.Everything about this film screams art, and although quite long, can be one of the most unique experiences you will ever witness on screen. You just have to sit back and render yourself to the beautiful landscapes and structures Kubrick presents to you.",Barry Lyndon
303,romanos_georgiou,All equal now,10,8 March 2009,"The story of Redmond Barry becoming Barry Lyndon in the social circles of 18th century England is a story of romance, war, fatherhood, betrayal, conflict, death, luck and...stillness. As if he leaved in a moving painting, Kubrick's hero tries to evolve and prosper in a totally still world. All of his misfortunes, most of which are told to the viewer from a distant, neutral and ironic narrator before Barry himself is aware of them, seem to be a natural outcome of his motionless environment. The great film maker decides to emphasize this in the very end, when he delivers his hero to his predetermined end and offers a single freeze frame only to let Barry finally be part of this era that just ended (in the unforgettable last sequence of the film, the final check that lady Lyndon signs has the date of the beginning of the French revolution).Stanley Kubrick's three hour obituary is excellent in every aspect, it is a rare cinematic jewel that captures the very sense of cinematography and has all the magic ingredients of an epic story telling. It is absolutely magnificent how the director captures the melancholy of his figures under the candle lights, in the gambling tables, in the duels or even on a romantic encounter under the fine classical sounds of a piano or a violin piece. It is a story for a man and an era long passed and forgotten, an oil painting that decided it would look prettier on film and perhaps, in this way, it would be easier to hide its dark and sad character, only to figure out that, like Barry, it had no choice whatsoever in any of life's crossroads and unfortunately at the end, slow and premeditated, it run out of luck.",Barry Lyndon
304,Ricky_Bozarth,kubrick's most under-appreciated film,10,8 June 2005,"When it was first released, a great deal of critical ink was spilled over this film. Over the years,however,the interest this film once generated has died. Even hardcore Kubrick fans rarely discuss it anymore. This should change. Not only is this Kubrick's most beautifully filmed movie(love those reds),but thematically it's also his most complete. Everyone of his themes,from man's dehumanization by systematized means to the threat of complete annhilation are here. It's worth a second look and greater appreciation. Also,another reason to reevaluate this film is because in todays world we still don't see much change from the stylish hypocrisy abounding in this film.Sort of Kubrick's way of telling us that no matter how much things change,etc..",Barry Lyndon

There are others who, on the contrary, inhibit and discourage. In this second category, feature films by director Stanley Kubrick, such as ""Barry Lyndon"", are usually included. They are ambitious undertakings on the intellectual side and enormous for the material.Here, the story of the adventures of the rogue Barry Lyndon is accompanied by the audacious use of the steady cam, following the advance of an army with the camera along an uneven terrain and without shaking. Even more spectacular is the use of special lenses so that the film could be lit by candlelight. More spectacular or more mannerist?

Worst of all it is about a time when Britain could arguably be said to be at its best.The seven war was successful for Great Britain, which gained the bulk of New France in North America, Spanish Florida, some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies, the colony of Senegal on the West African coast, and superiority over the French trading outposts on the Indian subcontinent.Stanley decided to take every worst attribute of being a human and make this film.

308,Zagreb-1,Leisurely-paced but masterful historical epic,9,21 October 2012,"It's rare that a film so rooted in the past it is set in feels like a bridge to the modern world that created it. Barry Lyndon is set in the 18th century but its protagonist is a thoroughly modern man in his ambitions: despite being born to lowly stock he fights and cons his way into a rigidly class-based, aristocratic society on the verge of being threatened by the American and French revolutions that would eventually lead to their destruction. Lyndon is almost a 20th century American conception of the ""folk hero"" - low-born, ruthless, utterly self-serving and completely making his way on his own merits. But this is not 20th century America and, despite his talents, he eventually comes into conflict with the British ruling class he has fought so hard to be the ""equal"" of and who feel so threatened by him and such contempt for his lack of ""breeding"".In many ways, more than any history book, this film tells us exactly what the ideological battlegrounds were in the 18th century. But Lyndon is no simple banner-waving hero, nor even political. His only desire is to further his own station and it is clear that he would gladly embrace the English aristocracy if not for the fact that they will never embrace him. He is in many ways an anti-hero and the audience will likely find themselves admiring and loathing him in equal measure throughout the film. Lyndon is a complex character, and gives the impression of a man who represses his sense of guilt and compassion in order to further himself rather than someone who feels neither.All of this takes place in one of the best looking films I have ever seen. Kubrick apparently wanted every shot to look like a painting and utilised natural light as much as possible. The result is a film as attractive as it is engaging. Despite this beauty it has a strong realist feel, particularly when it comes to violence. In one memorable scene British troops march purposefully towards the enemy who fire on them with dozens of the scarlet-coated soldiers falling as their comrades march on. Kubrick follows this with a shot of the carnage that has been left behind on the battlefield: dead and wounded, crawling men. The whole thing is the opposite of the picturesque, romantic image of 18th century warfare presented by the paintings Kubrick was influenced by in making this film.Barry Lyndon is a historical tale with a political undercurrent more rooted in the past it is set in than referring to the present. It can be enjoyed on that level or simply the story of a clever, manipulative man who tries to climb as high as he can through English society. Its length (about three hours) and leisurely pace mean it will be too slow for some and yet this film contains some of the most emotionally engaging scenes I've ever seen, particularly a gripping pistol duel towards the film's end. Along with Ridley Scott's The Duellists this is a more unromantic look at a period often steeped in crude sentimentality.",Barry Lyndon
309,toneskoda,i like the message of this film,9,4 October 2003,"stanley kubrick's films remind me on cartoons a little. probably because characters are similar in both and both have beautiful/different images and both break the rules in a way.i think that main message of this film is that people have allways rivaled/competed/quarrelled with each other and allways will and that this is by far the main goal or purpose of their lives and they find it most important thing. i think today it is still the same. but when 100 years or so pass these things (money, social status, pride, comfort, to be better than other people, to be recognized by other people, etc) which were so important then to those people aren't important anymore. what's important are the things those people did that are still important to people living today, or that people living today and in the future will have some use of: science, films, music etc.i also like very much characters which are very calm and rarely show any excitement or emotions.i like epilogue of the film the most:""It was in the reign of George III that the aforesaid personages lived and quarrelled; good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor they are all equal now.""9/10",Barry Lyndon

Forced to leave his country, Barry enlists in English Army and fights in Germany, and then deserted. He was caught by a Prussian high-command officer and had to join that Army. After a few years, he worked for the Prussian Government as a spy, and finally went free after a wise move against Captain Potzdorf. Redmond goes to England with the purpose of getting married with a wealthy, future-ensurer woman, and he accomplished his mission by marrying with Mrs. Lyndon, a rich and beautiful widow. From that moment on, Redmond was known as Barry Lyndon. The relationship was prestigious but loveless, and the friendship between Barry and Mrs. Lyndon's son was non existent. They conceived a child named Brian, and as time passed by, Barry was becoming a selfish, greedy person each time more, contrary of what he was like in his youth: brave and always honest. Because of a terrible accident, 9 year-old Brian died and Barry along with his wife went on a terrible depression, followed by a serious economic crisis. Mrs. Lyndon's older son challenged him to a duel, which was won by the young man (destroyed Barry's leg). He ended expelling Barry and his mother from the family and they returned to Ireland, where he probably ended the same way as he started: poor and unsatisfied.

My only problem is--and I know the French New Wave purists would chide me for saying it--is the 'literariness' of the adaptation of Thackeray's novel.

The evolution of the relationship between Redmund Barry and Lady Lyndon(performed by the sublime Marisa Berenson)and Lord Bullingdon is very well shown, and it moves me a lot. And what about the epilogue...It's one of those rare films that when you're watching it, you're so happy in front of so much beauty and wisdom that you need to thank the director.THANK YOU STANLEY!!We miss you.",Barry Lyndon
319,adev_opus,Best Periodic Film Ever,9,30 August 2020,"Stanley Kubrick is a God of Cinema. The film is shot using a beautiful lens given by NASA, intended to capture candle lights perfectly (because a periodic film can't have modern lights and also cause it's Stanley Kubrick). This lengthy films details the rise and fall of an English soldier and his adventure into the noble society.",Barry Lyndon
320,danthedanimal,wonderful,10,29 May 2012,"one of the best movies most people will never see. Beautiful. Stunning. A visual treat. Almost too perfect. But it's not a Bourne Conspiracy or a CSI murder mystery. It's a period piece with unbelievable scenery and costumes and something most films don't have... a story. Even at over three hours in length, I have watched this movie numerous times and each time I see something more exquisite. This takes more than genius to create something of this magnitude. It takes a complete and true artist to be this lavish.. to have an eye for so much detail. I was never enthralled with Ryan O'Neal in the lead.. but Kubrick paints him so deeply in the story that his limited skills are not noticeable. Take time to enjoy this one. It really is a work of pure genius!",Barry Lyndon
321,jbenante-1,"Beautiful to the Eyes, Painful to the Senses",3,22 December 2005,"Okay, I will admit that I saw this film only once, about 30 years ago. I had totally loved ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and couldn't wait to see Kubrick's latest. I was an English teacher at the time, and I recall one of my students telling me that her dad had seen the movie, and thought it was just about the most beautiful movie he'd ever seen. That really whet my appetite to see it even more.As it turns out, her dad wasn't wrong, exactly. ""Barry Lyndon"" as seen on the big screen is sumptuous. Scenes could be frozen and committed to canvas as works of art. The cinematography was grand.The story, less so. The plot was so forgettable, at least as presented in this movie, that I can scarcely remember any of it. I do recall one long, long protracted scene of Ryan O'Neal and Marissa Berenson (I think) riding in a carriage. He was smoking a pipe, or cigar, or whatever. They sat silently while riding, as he smoked and she periodically waved away his smoke with an annoyed, gloved hand (that's how I remember it anyway). The scene seemed to go on for a good 5 minutes, although it was probably just a minute or so that FELT like 5. I wanted to jump out of my skin. Honestly, I have a vague memory of having left the theater at intermission. I'm not completely sure that I did, it was so long ago. But if I did, it was the first and last time. I can tolerate boring movies. I am very, very difficult to offend. I can tolerate stupid, pointless movies. But ""Barry Lyndon"" seemed to be in another category altogether. I couldn't relate to anyone in the movie, least of all Ryan O'Neal's portrayal. At that time, he seemed to me to be, as an actor, completely without substance. Maybe Kubrick chose him exactly for that quality. I don't know.To be fair, maybe if I watched this movie again in the present, I would like it and appreciate it. But I doubt it.I give the movie a 3 out of 10 because of the beautiful cinematography, nothing more.",Barry Lyndon
322,harrisoncohen,"Barry Lyndon - ""A Cinematic Vision of Life""",9,8 January 2008,"It can easily be said that in order to be fully appreciated, the films of Stanley Kubrick require a second viewing or at the very least one which is undertaken with the fullest of dedication. Both Barry Lyndon and 2001 fit into this category - both masterpieces of cinematography and of sound, they both seem to divert very easily from the pathway of other typical notions of cinema. Unlike Kubrick's other works both these films depart from any sense of dialogue and although narrative is highlighted in Barry Lyndon through the presence of a narrator, there is none the less a far more powerful underlying narrative technique present. One of the few films ever to accomplish such an art is Barry Lyndon, in which the narrative is conveyed through the pure emotion, melancholy and silence of the film's protagonists. Redmond Barry's character rarely speaks within the film and his actions are undoubtedly more powerful than his words. Rather than face heated argument or debate he instead reverts to man's violent tendencies - this is clearly seen when he throws a wine glass in Captain Quin's face; the presence of duels and fighting throughout the film, which soon develops into that of a very powerful motif, which is furthermore enhanced when he is seen whipping his stepson, Lord Bullingham. Kubrick has shown through this multi-faceted masterpiece a fresh form of cinema and a power of silence. By reverting from the typical artistic tendency of pathetic fallacy, (indeed it is hardly ever seen to be raining or cloudy within the film) Kubrick instead uses silence to display such a sense of raw emotion. It is very crucial to notice that Barry and Lady Lyndon's characters almost never speak to one another throughout the film, which adds a layer of sadness and depression to the film's narrative, whilst Barry's simple words of ""I'm sorry"" speak volumes of their relationship, one which is marked by pain, sorrow, betrayal and greed. Kubrick has produced a film of epic proportion, and whilst the battle montages are easily rivalled by other period pieces, it is Kubrick's power to shoot the development of Barry Lyndon's protagonist throughout his life that remains the film's quintessential element. The film is adorned with a period score and other resonating pieces of classical and baroque period music, which compliment both the so-close to perfection cinematography, and in the same vain as Kubrick uses sound in 2001, the exclusion of dialogue within the film.Barry Lyndon is a film often overlooked within the Kubrick filmography due to its serious and slow-paced undertones. It is these undertones, however that help to build up the film into a work of art that inspires possibly only the most devoted of film enthusiasts. This film should be viewed as many have suggested as such, an artistic portrayal of a period long romanticised, yet scarcely interpreted with such loyalty and devotion to the screen. Whilst Barry Lyndon remains among the greatest works of modern cinema, it is one, whose viewing must only be conquered by the most passionate of film-goers, if it is ever to be truly appreciated. It accomplishes that which few films are capable of, in bringing pure life onto the screen. Perhaps only rivalled by the select few other masterpieces of cinema, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a life epic, which leaves the viewer shaken and inspired. It is a film with the power to leave the viewer standing upon a whole new perspective of life, one which told through the neutral story of Redmond Barry provokes pure sorrow and depression within the heart of the viewer.In short it could be said that Barry Lyndon is one film which embodies the real values of cinema, the ability to portray precisely the notion of life on the screen and that which so strongly affects and resonates within the mind of the viewer. It is a film that will leave even the strongest of viewers humbled and depressively shaken. It is film of outstanding expertise and experience, both in artistic nature and in narrative. Barry Lyndon is a modern masterpiece and should be viewed as such, a cinematic vision of life. If one were to simply define it as ""cinematic perfection"", in doing so one would be doing it an injustice.Harrison Cohen - harrisoncohen@msn.com",Barry Lyndon
323,VirusL4D,The most beautiful film ever made,10,19 October 2020,"Barry Lyndon is the proof that Stanley Kubrick was a league of his own. The cinematography has to be the greatest of all time. The lighting is unbelievable, every picture looks like an oil painting of a masterful artist.The music is breathtaking and timeless, the attention to detail is insane (clothing, interiors, etc.). I haven't quite seen a movie that has been crafted in such a precise manner like this one. You will lose yourself in the beautiful imagery and storytelling. The zoom-out-shots - which Kubrick is well known for - will make your jaw drop multiple times.A great successor to 2001: A Space Odyssey and maybe the best example of Kubrick's talent. I wish more people would talk about this movie. Nobody should miss it!",Barry Lyndon
324,LilCProductions-CA,Scenes interminably long,5,30 December 2018,"I think I just don't get the genius of Kubrick. This movie reminds me a lot of the previous film I have seen of his, Eyes Wide Shut. In both, the music was too loud and overused, often in long shots where very little to nothing happened. As another reviewer said, it's like the music was a substitute for real action. Surely, an interesting film could be made with this plot, but this film wasn't it.Each scene could have been cut by 1/3 to 1/2, with profitable results. Even establishing shots (such as ""here we are at a castle"") were simply too long. It's like we were watching a cinematographer's CV reel, rather than a story. Anyway, I watched the entire thing and the pace never quickened.Unlike others, I won't blame Ryan O'Neal. I think Kubrick must have directed him to be wooden and stoic, since everyone was basically wooden and stoic, save for attempted suicide and stepson's outburst scenes. O'Neal can be more of an outgoing swashbuckler (see The Main Event), so we have to assume he was told not be (see also Samuel L. Jackson in the Star Wars prequels). Anyway, I did not enjoy watching the film any more than I enjoyed the overrated Eyes Wide Shut. I just don't get it.On the other hand, if you watch movies solely for set decoration, costumes, and establishing shots rather than storytelling, you might enjoy this.",Barry Lyndon

The great character actors brought a humorous edge to it most notably Murray Melvin and Leonard Rossiter.It looked beautiful and the editing was sharp, an editing style that accompanied and complemented the wonderful music for long sections, like it coasted along with the musical beats.I thought the pacing was good and never lingered longer than it needed to, even though sometimes shots intentionally lingered which I did like mainly due to the wonderful cinematography. Every scene looked like an oil painting, camera barely moving and holding the frame. It was a beautiful looking film.I was only really gripped once during the final pistol duel and that whole segment was pushed along by 11 minutes of music from where Lord Bullingdon entered the drink house Lyndon occupied until just after the final shot of the duel.I don't think the film was meant to keep you gripped, like I said it humoured, it was an amusement.

It's a musical masterpiece that also has the greatest dialog and cinematography in movie history so far. The narrator makes the story easy to understand, and this does not become a bad thing. The narration is just so well written. It's amazing that this movie was able to make us root for Redmond Barry in the first half and hate him (or this new arrogant version of him) in the second half. This is the life of a man who failed to make it big, and it has been shown in the best way possible.

Our protagonist is courageous, yet spiteful, frank, yet subtle, a character of his times trapped between borders cut across revolution, languages, and traits. Not only is this one of the most beautifully shot films of all time, the colors, the simplicity of movements, but it is also one of the most entertaining, a true adventure. A masterful director, cast in order. If anything, the a story of a lost person's searching, in order to not only survive, but thrive, is distinctly powerful.

330,sherif-laoun,"Linear and dull, but...",4,17 February 2012,"A beautiful yet totally dull movie. It is easy to see why Ryan O'Neal never became a big star after 'Love Story'. The camera loves him and he loves himself, yet there are no emotions. We know he is deeply in love because the narrator tells us. We know he is angry and jealous, because he says he is. We know he is sad, nostalgic and melancholic because we see tears on his face. I watched the whole movie agape, laughing at its plodding linearity and it's total lack of valleys or peaks. The actions of the characters are driven by the script, not by impulsion, greed, love, friendship or fear. Marisa Berenson comes off better than Mr. O'Neal, though less is asked of her. The ending is perfunctory. With as little heart or drive as the events that first set Barry Redmond on his trip away from Ireland. Why did Stanley Kubrick make this movie with nothing to say?

Each scene is beautifully crafted, and each frame of the film could be used as a painting in an art museum. I don't think there's a more picturesque film out there than this one - though A Clockwork Orange would be a close second. The witty third person narrative was a great touch...never detracts from the story even though he tells you what happens beforehand. Barry, like Alex in ACO, is a despicable character, but you can't help but identify and sympathize when the situation calls for it. In the 3+ hour run time (though it never feels as long) - you feel every different emotion for Barry that Kubrick/Thackeray intended. In one scene you'll be apologetic, in the next you'll be outraged. Ryan O'Neal and Leon Vitali both give excellent performances, and the rest of the cast does an amiable job as well.It's not a film for everyone, as it takes it's time unfolding the story (as many Kubrick films do), and yes, it is rather long...but if viewed for nothing more than the beauty of it, itself, this masterpiece should be seen at least once by anyone who considers themselves a lover of film.

I mention this because I have discussed this film with several people of various taste and found it to be a recurring criticism. This said, if you are willing and able to watch a life unfold (and unravel) over the course of a few hours in some very subtle and rewarding ways, then Barry Lyndon is worth considering. The music is famous enough, with Handel's slightly modified Sarabande, and Schubert's haunting piano trio (is there a better use of music in film?), the costumes and sets are gorgeous (Kubrick has period paintings behind some of his memorable shots) and the acting is brilliant and engaging.

335,BillW,The Art of Film,10,21 October 1999,"Perhaps the greatest film ever made, Barry Lyndon defies description in the usual sense that one may describe a film. That is, the plot is not really a plot; the cinematography is unlike anything you've ever seen; the music (arranged and conducted by Leonard Rosenman) is entirely authentic to the period; and the performances, especially that of Ryan O'Neal, set a mood rather than tell a story. (The fact that Mr. O'Neal was willing to turn in such an innocuous performance at the pinnacle of his career speaks volumes for the star's character.)The point of this film is not in the script, it's in the overall experience. If you try to view it as a movie, it will fail you (or rather the other way around). But if you approach it as a work of art-- a wonderfully detailed painting combined with a fantastic symphony, you will enjoy it immensely.As with all of Kubrick's films, don't expect entertainment. This is art. That is why it gets such wildly mixed reviews. Where most of today's filmed entertainment is the cinematic equivalent of rock-n-roll, Kubrick's films are mostly waltzes. If you go into them expecting a patient, moving experience you will enjoy them tremendously; and this one above all.Barry Lyndon is the definition of the Art of Film. The world of film is far poorer for the loss of Stanley Kubrick.",Barry Lyndon

A letter takes a couple of months to be delivered. A plus in my view.Some people question the choice of Ryan O'Niel as 'Barry"".

At first glance you might think of it as an ordinary historical film, scene after scene following each other, like a traditional TV-soap opera, but hidden behind the beautiful setting, clothing, surroundings and modest acting (the acting is actually brilliant), you find a critical and honest film about life itself, ambitions, weakness, betrayal and disasters. And is there any other film that is made like a historical 18th century painting? Visconti´s Il Gattopardi is the only equal film ever made.

There is nothing (NOTHING) about this story which would captivate the Sesame Street generation, who are used to quick cuts, action, and rapid mood changes to keep them alert.

He tells the story of Redmond Barry, a brash, larger than life character. A character who commands an end quote about how we all end up the same. But in Kubrick's world, character is secondary to art and all are given to introspection and long, hard gazes.And so it is that Kubrick tells the story of a fairly ordinary man with tremendous strokes of luck. His driving characteristic of seizing every opportunity that falls his way incongruously breaks down in a duel with his archenemy. Kubrick obviously painted himself into a corner there as he claimed to be showing how the aspects of Redmond's personality that lead him to the top were also behind his downfall.",Barry Lyndon
345,mjcarney_00,One of the greatest movies ever made. Beautiful Cinematography,10,7 September 2007,"Barry Lyndon is at once the most under-appreciated Kubrick movie, and possibly Kubrick's greatest crowning achievement. The reason it is under-appreciated actually stem from its pacing probably more than the fact that it's derided as a period piece (because if you see the movie, full of sex, gambling, war, awesome duels (and some of the best duel scenes/suspense scenes Kubrick's ever shot)......The pace of this movie is it's only flaw, but the pace actually is something that helps bring the viewer into the movie upon further viewings.....it is probably the only movie that really feels more like a book, as Kubrick spares no time expense in developing these characters, and after each viewing the viewer will sense the effect of Kubrick at his peak.This is not a movie to watch when you want to see a ""Shining"" or ""Full Metal Jacket"" type of action.....Barry Lyndon is a very detailed period story featuring all the peaks and setting pace of a book. This is a perfect movie to have an intermission with, to help you regroup and be engrossed in the story. THe dramatic highs (Jonathan Quinn duel, War, Gambling, Fight, and later duels) feature some of the finest work (Acting, camera work, directing) ever put on film. This movie took me 2 viewings or so to get, and I've seen it maybe 5-6 times now, and I can tell you, Barry Lyndon quickly moved up to the top of my movie list. It's a must see (at least twice). The acting is phenomenal, the movie is a labor of love, the cinematography is beautiful, the sets/lighting is amazing. It's hard to believe this movie is 30+ yrs old and is virtually unknown except to the Kubrick faithful. This is a MUST SEE!Overall, I'd rank Kubrick Movies as follows (I've yet to see Spartacus and a couple early ones and I'm not counting A.I.).1) Barry Lyndon: 10/10 2) Paths of Glory: 10/10 (pretty much a tie with #1) 3) Shining 10/10: I love this one, even if it's a bit more derided 4) Full Metal Jacket 10/10. NOT a feel good movie, but a great one nonetheless 5) Eyes Wide Shut: 9/10. Creepy and underrated. Acting was GREAT! 6) Lolita: 9/10....I like this more and more each time, it's moved up. 7) A Clockwork Orange: 8/10. Disturbing, well acted, a bit too over the top and the rape scenes are a bit too much (and it's a bit long). 8) 2001: A Space Odyssey. 8/10. I saw this in a theater 2 years ago and loved it, but it's pace makes it tough to watch at home, so I marked it down a bit. 9) The Killing: 8/10. Very Good and pretty much forgotten but worth seeing. 10) Dr. Strangelove. The only Kubrick movie to date I've watched multiple times and not really understood the hype. It's reasonably funny, but has nothing on Lolita or Clockwork for humour. 6/10.",Barry Lyndon
346,huguesboisvert747,A movie with an astonishing beauty who suffers from it's oblivion,9,4 August 2008,"Barry Lyndon is part of the movies that, thought their interesting matter, have difficulty to get a place in cinema memory. But it constitutes a gorgeous piece of art and a major work by Stanley Kubrick as all other movies by the director. Despite a much less artistic print than other Kubrick's work, it's incredible beauty provided by the scenario and the magnificent shots reflects the professionalism of the direction and all the departments of the production.The most remarkable side of the picture is the beauty of the shots and the rich colors that constitutes the film itself. Technically, Barry Lyndon is a masterpiece by the quality of the image. To make the film, Stanley Kubrick took old cameras from the BBC and adapted the objectives to get that astonishing shots. With their unique conception, the cameras have the particularity to flatten the image to give the impression of viewing a painting. With the great quality of the costumes, it makes the movie wonderful from end to end. The work of William Makepeace Thackeray is also part of the beauty of the movie, it makes reflect without making morality, it is built with a great conscience of society and, despite the fact that the book was written in 1844, it is still possible to associate the tale in our time. The story is well adapted and divided, scenes are wonderfully directed so the movie is interesting at all, even if it lasts 3 hours.

If the movie were sped up at all, the passage of time would seem rushed. The plot is intriguing, at times making you dislike Lyndon but at other times making you pity him. However, the costumes, scenery and lighting make the movie fascinating to watch. I originally thought this was going to be overly-dry, but was pleasantly surprised to see classic- Kubric humor stuck into the plot at just the right times. Beyond the costumes and settings, the plot paints a fascinating outline of life in the 1800s. I just wish they would have focused more on the social structure, and I wonder how realistic some of the plot would have been at the time (e.g. being able to move around the continent so easily).

348,andionita,Just sumptuous,9,12 October 2008,"I regard Barry Lyndon as a highly distinct film. As I have seen many 20 years olds like me commenting on the film, I was motivated to respond.The first complain that comes to mind is the narration. This is a told story, not one when the viewer is left to discover the outcomes from its characters' adventures. And - mind you - it is a narrated movie par excellence. So some viewers are bothered when events are described before they actually happen, including the ending. I think this is the beauty of it. We here assume the role of the admirers. We contemplate the scenes, discover the smell of the era. Kubrick knows this is not a movie that needs to move fast, because it has a remote subject. The viewers are left the necessary moments to relate and comprehend the events that happened in times when man lived quite a different life. A life candlelit by night, instable and war-struck, insecure. The family theme is at a sad period. Duels are occur on an almost daily basis, and their leading to death is treated awkwardly... fair.Most of these are surely elements that we have to believe, in some sense be hypnotized in order to believe them. Ultimately this lead us to see that the values implied are timeless. One is left pondering at the end on this matter: what elements (life stages, truth and lies, courage, etc) are still present today, and in what form, with what consequences, etc.? This exercise is mandatory for a great movie - even if Barry Lyndon is indeed a story, it is not the straightforward story.All in all I believe we are presented a solid fragment of life from the 18th century. It is just for its complexity, its ups and downs, the long and winding road that its main character follows that mark this effort a candidate for a masterpiece.Try seeing it as gentle and appealing introduction to history, painting and music!",Barry Lyndon

Better then the book it was based on. Filmed beautifully. Feels like the viewer is being transported back to the 18th century. Soundtrack is wonderful. The film's battle-sequences top Kubrick's until then best- those seen in Strangelove.

I couldn't believe it when it started, the first scenes are so bad... I thought that it was bad acting, but soon I realized that was the script, there are some really stupid lines, I don't use this kind of words often but it's just that: stupid. It gets a little better as is advancing, is not the worst thing neither, but yes is dull.Now, the last thing.

353,macateer4,This is a fantastic film,10,27 June 2006,"For years I had deliberately avoided this film, the thought of Ryan O'Neal with a clunky Irish accent and bad period acting had scarred me away but what a delight it was when I finally bit the bullet and watched it.Firstly I normally hate to watch period pieces particularly those adapted from English literature of the time, the unrealistic characters and sentimental plots make my skin crawl. But here we have the story of Redmond Barry lovable(?) Irish rogue and his adventures through Europe. The acting is superb throughout, O'Neal even pulls off a believable enough accent and is well cast as titular character, portraying his initial naivety and ultimate world-weariness with aplomb. As with all Kubrick films it is beautifully shot, the period setting allowing sumptuous costumes, scenery and backdrops. Each scene looks like an oil painting, add to this a fantastic selection of classical pieces for the movie's score and you have a feast for your ears and eyes. But, crucially, this film in held together and driven along by a witty, dark and realistic story. It is long, but your patience will be well rewarded.",Barry Lyndon

355,VietnamZombie,Barry Lyndon (10/10) Classic!,10,14 April 2006,"Barry Lyndon by Stanley Kubrick is an ultimate classic for me. It shares so many attributes with Kubricks more renowned work 'A Clockwork Orange'. The script is fabulous and sophisticated yet very rarely harsh. Each scene is beautiful, as though it could be a painting or a postcard. The film is filled with great scenery, artwork and excellent music (as is Clockwork Orange). The film features some magnificent castles, houses, decoration all of which looks genuine. It shows the scenery of the British Isles like no film before. This shows Kubricks talent as an artist.Although the story never gets really 'deep' the film still captivates an audience because of it's bizarre layout. The film layout seems very retro to me, in the way the film is structured around the narrators input. As with 'Clockwork Orange' the use of language, accents and local talk leaves a big impact. The layout reminds me of the way the great Tolkien story's - very exact, to the point and no beating around the bush. The film takes the audience through the incredible life of a young Irish man named Redmond Barry, through his days of glory, to great happiness right through to utter madness.The film is long winded, but by no means is this a bad thing. This length allows the audience to get an incredible insight into more-or-less every character. The acting is very basic and the script seems very down to earth to me. This is why I loved the film. You can watch the film and really get a feel for what this era in Britain was like.All respect to Kubrick for this one. Magal.",Barry Lyndon

If your a fan of true art you're a fan of this film.Kubrick was a photographer before directing film. This is the reason why he is one of my favourite directors, he has a sense of visual style and most of all a sense of composition. All the great directors have this and all the truly great films do too. Some films allow you to be thrilled or exited, though with it's use of high artistic skill this film allows you to experience.

Barry Lyndon is anything but a ""period piece"" --just as Kubrick's science-fiction films depict a parallel of our own society, this film depicts the decadent eighteenth-century aristocracy in a way that also parallels our own.  Kubrick's artful directing is brilliant, especially in the pivotal duel scenes.

358,Benko-2,Kubrick's painterly odyssey,10,3 December 1998,"The hallmark of a Stanley Kubrick film has always been the ability to transport the viewer to a uniquely rendered cinematic world of meticulously crafted detail and thought provoking themes. Moreover, Kubrick continually creates a new visual language with which to communicate in very uniquely appropriate terms.  Certainly this is true with ""Barry Lyndon."" Kubrick's painterly odyssey of 18th century European society is presented on an epic canvas. What makes it unique and ultimately haunting is how Kubrick views his subjects literally as figures in an artist's landscape ""trapped"" within a pre-determined frame. The tableau unfolds continually in scene after scene that begins with a close-up and slowly pulls back to reveal the ""big picture"" all the while an ironic narrator tells of their upcoming fates. Kubrick's compositions are evocative of the era paintings of Hogarth, Gainsborough and Watteau rendered on film with real candlelit interiors as opposed to artifical movie lighting.This elegiac portrait of the transience of time is a uniquely poetic piece of cinematic art.",Barry Lyndon

360,DorianF,The finest period film ever made,10,5 July 2002,"Barry Lyndon is a big-screen version of the Thackaray novel which describes the rise and fall of Redmond Barry, a common but fiesty Irishman who (through luck as much as skill) ascends the ranks of British nobility.It's a great pity that this is one of the lesser-seem works of Stanley Kubrick, for this is a highly believable and entertaining recreation of 18th century Europe with none of the stuffiness that many movies and TV shows set in this era substitute for atmosphere.Like Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon is a film of two halves but it hangs together much better, perhaps due to the deliberate intermission and cue cards. The first part of the film covers Barry's early years in Ireland and his career in the army, before a chance meeting offers him the opportunity to move on in life. The scenes in the first part of the film are always entertaining, and often stunningly beautiful. Of particular note is a scene where Barry meets a German woman on his way through Europe - the combination of the incredible low-light photography and outstanding use of music make this scene one of the most touching I have ever scene, even if the behaviour of the characters is something we can understand but not necessarily condone.Once the intermission has passed, we know that Barry has indeed meet a suitable and very wealthy aristocrat whom he marries. But the warmth and passion we would expect in these scenes after seeing the first part of the movie are non-existent, indicating that not all is well.From hilariously camp army officers to the 'bravery' of Leonard Rossiter's army officer, this film is pure entertainment that is very difficult to better.",Barry Lyndon

Kubrick produced a piece of sheer movie magic with this one and I can't believe how often this film gets overlooked in lists of people's favorite Kubrick films.The cinematography in this film is truly something to behold, it really looked like those great Rembrandt and Vermeer paintings came alive.. plus the dialog, the costumes, the pacing, the beauty of the countryside make this film a feast for the senses.. for nearly 3 hours I felt like I was THERE..I think the reason this film gets overlooked is because Kubrick was known for breaking new ground, which you could say he didn't do with this movie, but I think this should be seen as the definitive period film against which all others should be measured.. movies like 2001, Strangelove, and Clockwork were perhaps more daring and original but Barry Lyndon is not inferior to any of them in terms of craftsmanship.. and I think this one stands out as Kubrick's most emotional and involving film from the human point of view..The dry, ironic narration, the dialog, the visual wonders make this possibly his most entertaining film as well.. how anyone could find this boring I don't understand... there's always something going on, and the beauty is that sometimes Kubrick isn't afraid to linger on visually dazzling shots..In conclusion, if you are one of those ardent Kubrick fans who always skipped this film thinking it's just another ""period piece"" then I advise you to see it now!",Barry Lyndon
365,El_Mendigo,"Barry Lyndon, underrated, but not justly so",9,14 January 2010,"Barry Lyndon seems to be one of Kubrick's least appreciated films in that it receives very little attention when compared to some of his other movies. I really don't think it should be so underrated, but there you have it.Barry Lyndon clocks in at just over three hours long and it is understandable why some people might find it too much to take in in one sitting. I had no problems with it and was utterly captivated by the film. It may be slow at times, but I found no moment boring at all.It's got great acting in my opinion and it really feels extremely authentic to me. Everything from the clothes and settings to the shots using candles as the only lighting. It just feels so...real.And of course, this is Kubrick so there is that unique beauty which only he could put into his films. That's basically what this film is: beautiful. This film, for me, is just massive, but it definitely isn't for everyone and that is the reason it isn't as well known as other Kubrick movies. However, for any Kubrick fan this is a must see and I really wish it were that way for everyone. But hey, to each his own.This movie isn't perfect, but it's pretty damn close.

368,maxhasler,One of the most intelligent period dramas ever filmed,10,19 February 2010,"A teacher once told me that great novels have within them an image of themselves. The same goes for great movies too; famous examples include Jake La Motta futilely punching his cell wall in Raging Bull and an old Foster Kane (Citizen Kane) passing a pair of facing mirrors, creating a never-ending corridor of his own reflections until we are unsure which is the real Kane and which a reflection. Barry Lyndon has several of these moments, and there are two that stick in my mind.The first is a moment when Lyndon is reading a story to his son. The camera slowly pans away from the two of them revealing a vast painting behind them until the two figures seem insignificant, diminished by the size of the artwork. None of the characters in Barry Lyndon are sympathetic, not a single one - the anti-hero of the film is utterly self absorbed and amoral and his wife is such a pathetic, hopeless victim that she even fails to poison herself and her supposed salvation by her son leaves her in an equally unfulfilling life. As for the son, who could have been the real moral standard bearer, he comes across as a snivelling, self-important brat (wonderfully referenced in Blackadder the Third in Pit the Younger). Needless to say, all this is intentional - the characters are supposed to come across this way so that the real stars of the film become the time, scenery, fate and the narrator (a wonderful use of Michael Hordern's silken tones). The film is stunningly lit (using only natural lighting wherever possible) and is filled with still images that could be lifted straight from the paintings of Hogarth or Gainsborough. I've seen beautiful films before, but this is on a different scale to anything else I've seen. Against this, the characters diminish in size and importance and become props to decorate the background. Indeed, you begin to get the impression that nothing in this film happens without the director's say-so, there's even a bit where a baby cries with perfect comic timing. The film constantly reminds us of man's insignificance (most poignantly done in the Epilogue), and that he is subject to the whims of fate. Fate in the film is represented by the music and the narrator. The theme of the film comes in multiple variations of a piece by Handel; its repetition serves to remind the viewer of fate driving the characters to the inevitable consequences of their actions. The narrator serves as another version of fate, often wittily revealing what's about to happen just before it does. That's not to say that this film is devoid of excitement. What is rarely mentioned is that Barry Lyndon is at times very funny (a particular highlight for me being an overly romantic conversation between two soldiers in a lake). Also many of the duels a genuinely tense, particularly the final one; whether or not you know the conclusion has no relevance as to tension - a good thriller remains so the second time round.The other moment of self reference I picked up on in the film is in the duels. The duels function both as a narrative theme - Barry Lyndon vs. the aristocracy, vs. his step son, vs. the world etc., as well as a filmic one. All of the duels are in some way false, and this seems to be Kubrick's comment on films and life - a series of phoney rituals, repeated because of misguided ideas and dreams. Barry Lyndon is itself a sort of fake film, replicating the duels: a lot of what is expected of such a film is absent; the rug is pulled out from under the viewer. For me this is one of the most successful period dramas and literary adaptations I've seen – one that not only makes you think again about the writing, but about cinema in general.",Barry Lyndon

I keep returning to the film to learn more about story, direction, and cinematography.A recent book critical of American art and culture (by a, shall we say, conservative cultural warrior) posed the question ""What work of art of the past 50 years will be remembered 500 years from now?"" The questioner, and the editorialist who quoted the question were taking aim at Quentin Tarantino. Well, ""Pulp Fiction"" will be remembered, and so will everything produced/directed by Stanley Kubrick. And of all of his films, this one is my favorite.The choice of the novel by Thackery as source material was brilliant. But Kubrick took it a step further by adopting an attitude flavored by Balzac and de Maupassant, although not as cynical. Rather, it is a work of naturalism, deliberately heightened by the Kubrick's signature geometrical camera direction, and his use of natural light.Every serious lover and student of film-making must see this movie, and see it again, and again.

373,KimotoCat,A film so easily dismissed,10,24 January 2005,"In the midst of the many wonderful films made by Stanley Kubrick, it is strange to note how rarely people mention ""Barry Lyndon"".The film portrays an unusual young Irish man, Redmond Barry, and his endeavours as he is forced to leave his home and tries to make good his life elsewhere. His life away from home starts out as a career in the British Army; only to evolve in surprising ways and lead to as different places as a position of trust within the Prussian Army and later a title of nobility, gained by what our time can only measure as rather disgraceful means.Some consider Barry Lyndon a slow and tedious film  and it is in deed past three hours in length, but this is because of the artistic flow of a film that strays not only to tell a tale about a man who is by no means neither hero nor villain, but also a film which is in no hurry and takes the time for every detail to sink into the mind and heart of the viewer. Some of the scenic images in ""Barry Lyndon"" are in themselves pieces of art, rendered with a passion for the landscapes and the man-made structures within them.The myth that all scenes were recorded using no artificial lighting no doubt stems from the very realistic lights during indoor takes, and some of them truly did not feature artificial light. This is but one of the many details that so easily conveys a sense of a realistic portray of the era; the 18th century and the time after the seven-year war in the later half of the century. The impressive atmosphere and the wonderfully picturesque scenarios along with the fact that the entire plot moves at a calm pace makes this film a very pleasant experience.""Barry Lyndon is"", amidst Kubricks' many masterpieces, a film so easily dismissed due to length and the fact that it is overshadowed by others, but I deeply recommend this film to anyone who would like to see a film both for the plot line, the story and the pure enjoyment of the images presented.

376,freethinker78,the finest period piece I've ever seen.,10,22 November 2005,"I often find myself avoiding period films. This is normally due to the stilted acting, or the movie being entirely historically inaccurate. ""Vanity Fair"" is a good example of this. It is by the same author as Barry Lyndon, but is completely off the mark. It is obvious that you are watching modern actors trying to act like they aren't modern. (Invariably by using a British accent, even if it's a civil war film.) I will admit that big reason why this movie is different is because I have a weakness for Kubrick films. The austere and symbolic aspects of his films, the breathtaking cinematography and framing as well as the understated acting that he requires; these aspects all really appeal to me. This movie is no exception.Another Kubrick aspect to this film is his relentless pursuit of his inner vision. He had to practically invent a camera lens (based on prototypes built by NASA) to achieve his entirely candlelit scenes. He studied period paintings for months in order to work out his storyboards. He used authentic antique costumes. He would play Classical music from the time in order to improve his actors' mood.The overall effect of this effort is that the movie draws you into its setting, making you truly feel like you are living in the time of the characters.

A masterpiece, by a true master artist. I don't believe I have bestowed a '10' rating prior to this, but upon this film, I am compelled. If you have not viewed it, I can only insist that you do so when undisturbed, in peace. As Jack Nicholson said, ""Kubrick was the man."" I could in no way disagree with such sentiment.

379,khrissbliss,My 5 favorite observations & details about Barry Lyndon,10,17 June 2016,"My 5 favorite observations & details about why the movie Barry Lyndon is so intriguing. (Although most of these are not mine, they helped me appreciate my favorite film.)1) The narrator is unreliable: different because he is not first person like in the novel, but similar by not telling the exact truth.Barry Lyndon is very much in a passionate struggle to shape his life yet the narrator dismisses him as a heartless womanizer doomed (""as fate would have it"") for his unsuitability for polite society- which itself acts accordingly to its own fixed playbook (""fine family fortune!"") In fact, both Lord Bullingdon and his father mock Barry's non-Lord-liness with the metaphor of stepping ""into my shoes"". Also, the women do in fact care about Barry and he does care for them (and of course his numerous father figures)- it is the NARRATOR who lacks heart. The second half is very much about Lady Lyndon grappling with the heartbreak of trying to be happy while in love with this very imperfect Irishman- (namely, regarding his interactions with her first son, other women, and his mother.) So.....The narrator tells us what to think about, but not what to think; so the viewer has to question (& re-question) his judgement as well as the characters'. 2) Lots of moments happen offscreen (his father's quarrel about purchasing horses, cousins falsifying the ammunition, Barry mentioning a commander O'Grady, his son sneaking off to the horse stable; there are countless key events described but not witnessed; all of which refocuses the significance of what Kubrick DID intentionally put in front of the camera) Like Richard Schickel said, critics bicker about what Kubrick didn't do; Kubrick lovers enjoy his films in an uncomplicated fashion for what he DID present.Thus the viewer has to actively filter through the narrator's misdirection to appreciate the characters quietly reacting to the impact of missing moments.3) The scene where Barry meets Lady Lyndon at the gambling table is easily encapsulated by two quiet details which communicate so much; 1) Reverend Lunt's eyes as he espies the other two making eye contact, 2) how she is breathing on the terrace. (Note: there is only one substantial line in this whole scene; ""Samuel, I'm going outside for a breath of air."") (It is also poignant to note that Barry's profession is rigging games of chance.)4) No offense to Schubert and Haydn, but Leonard Rosenman's music arrangements are unmistakable; nobody does these tunes like him because remarkably he has seamlessly sewn them to the MEANING of the images and narrative. 5) When you consider the theme of three duels by firearms, also include the boxing match and the fencing match; and possibly all three abuses of Lord Bullington; and possibly even the robbery; they are all head-to-head confrontations that shape Barry's fortunes, character, & competence (dramatically!), ...but only the final climactic duel tells us who he has become.This is the key reason I offer these insights: Spielberg is correct in saying every time one repeatedly views a Kubrick film one gets something new; BUT Kubrick himself probably intended a singular perspective: so it is ideal for viewers to appreciate all these enigmas the first (few) times viewing -while being overwhelmed by this flip book of fine art paintings set to classical music. This is NOT a heated epic saga of inner personal thoughts breathlessly rendered by method actors in bravura theatrical performances amid iconic scenes to be parodied on the Simpsons. Most contemporary moviegoers should not dig this film the first time. (Cinema had a specific audience before Star Wars & Jaws.) Self-proclaimed Kubrick fans should NOT expect Clockwork Orange or Strangelove, nor 2001 or The Shining. The stars of this movie are the camera, the era, the universal shortcomings of humans ...and the tacit intrigue of the audience; in other words, the star is purely Kubrick.",Barry Lyndon
380,sapap,uniqueness in narrative,10,9 March 1999,"while reading previous comments i'm struck by the lack of reference or attention to the voice-over narrative.  when paying close attention one, realizes that the narrative is either not accurately reflecting what's in the moving frames or is contradicting them.  look and listen closely.  ask yourselves why this is?  why is kubrick doing this?also:  has anyone noticed the structure of the film resembles that of a fugue?  not inconsistent with general musical quality of the film.  the music also resounds as it itself acts as a harmony or reflection of the simultaneous action on screen.",Barry Lyndon
381,Spraggs,William Makepeace Thackeray turns in his grave!,3,19 May 1999,"Kubrick so utterly fails to capture the spirit of Thackeray's picaresque novel with this vague and tiresome film that it has absolutely no business using the title Barry Lyndon. Thackeray's Barry Lyndon is a brash, swaggering, status-seeking rogue with a dynamic (but seriously faulted) personality, and an indomitable will who  actively schemes, fights, and bullies his way through life. A true existentialist anti-hero.  Kubrick's Barry Lyndon , played by Ryan O'Neal, couldn't be more different, even though he  participates in some of the same activities as the character in the novel does. Kubrick's Lyndon has the demeanor of gentle choirboy: intensely quiet and soft-spoken with a penchant for long, earnest gazes (as is everyone in the film.)  His personality is so completely vague and undefined that next to Thackeray's brilliantly extroverted protagonist, he is practically walking corpse. Thackeray's Lyndon is a man who compels our admiration (even affection) as well our contempt such is the force of his personality. Kubrick turns him into practically a non-entity who even at the end of this three hour film remains a paradoxical and annoying enigma. We learn nothing about what makes him tick because there is nothing there. I really found myself wondering if Kubrick actually read the novel - perhaps he got a synopsis from  a script writer. Did they have Cliff Notes when this movie was made?! The film is steeped in an introspective, meditative atmosphere exemplified by the R. O'Neal character which is totally unsuited to the vigorous, ironic, and humorous tone of the novel. Kubrick has taken the fictional memoirs of a daring, villainous  schemer and gambler and sucked all the energy and life out of them to make a tepid, pensive, piece of aesthetic boredom. The only scene that has any dramatic tension is the duel between Bullingdon and Lyndon which, ironically, is not in the novel. When adapting literature for the cinema doesn't a director have an obligation to the work's author to remain faithful to that author's artistic vision? It's understandable that some concessions must be made when moving between two such different mediums as literature and cinema; but to have such blatant disregard for the essence of the novel from which this film takes its title, Kubrick is guilty of artistic hijacking. It galls me to think that there are probably more persons living now who have seen Kubrick's  bogus version of B.Lyndon than have read the novel; Kubrick, unfortunately, has had the last word because of film's cultural dominance. If a director wants to benefit from the cachet of using the title of a classic novel by an eminent author than he is obliged to remain faithful to that author's vision and not to utterly disregard it as Kubrick has done to such a wretched effect here.",Barry Lyndon

To this day I can't explain the attraction, but the plodding, quiet, truthful feel is captivating. To view another period in history as vividly as this one portrays it is indeed a rare treat.

While beautiful in every aspect, I found myself thoroughly distracted from the flat acting of Ryan O'Neal by the AWFUL insistence of Kubrick to abuse the zoom lens of the camera.  Just when I was getting to take a good look around at the beautiful picture, Kubrick would pan out at an abrupt pace that didn't serve any purpose to show the ""bigger"" picture.While the story itself wasn't boring (it did manage to keep my attention for the duration of the film), it certainly isn't ground-breaking in any way. Like some of Kubrick's other work, Barry Lyndon fails to capture the imagination of the audience with writing and characters, but leaves it all up to the prettiness of the film.  Give me a break!

It is like a window to history, like a trip back in time. I know some people consider the story rather hollow, and I'm prepared to agree with this view, however, the exceedingly beautiful succession of images is like a Gainsborough exhibition and it makes up for the plot.

The formal beauty of the shots masks the actual ruthlessness, sadness and greed of the characters. Rather than giving a historical account on how this life was like, Kubrick reminds us how Barry's rise and fall is just one example of the vicious circle of human cunning for opulence.

The story was engaging but not entirely satisfactory, the acting was inconsistent and the soundtrack was terribly utilised. It was pretty in terms of the cinematography but it seems that that is all the film has to offer. Definitely not Kubrick's master work.",Barry Lyndon
392,melanier,Masterpiece,9,8 October 2001,"Barry Lyndon is one of my favourite films of all time.   Kubrick's craftsmanship is impeccable.   The film is slow and dreamy in its pace which, along with the scenic shots, establishes a romanticised watercolour view of the period (somewhat like a Carpenter landscape). In fact, Kubrick has set up almost every shot (indoor and out) like a painting. This romanticism provides an interesting counterpoint against Lyndon's less than admirable actions throughout the film. I would have to say that the best acting in Barry Lyndon comes from some of the minor actors.   Leonard Rossiter delivers a fantastic portrait of the arrogant Captain Quinn, with exaggerated  facial expressions and movements (eg. like in the dance scene, or when his engagement to Nora is announced) that are perfect for the self-aggrandising bluster of this character.  Leon Vitali as Lord Bullingdon also gives an insightful performance as Barry's stepson.",Barry Lyndon
393,jurian99,"Brilliant, my favorite Kubrick movie.",9,11 August 2002,"*CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS*I have been a Kubrick fan for many years. It al started when I watched""The shining"" and films like ""A clockwork orange"" and the brilliant ""2001: A space odyssey"" made me only love his work more. But I never saw Barry Lyndon untill last week. I didn't really know what to expect. I'm not a really big fan of those historical movies, but I figured what the hell, its kubrick so it can't be that bad. It wasn't.Barry lyndon is an absolute masterpiece. It tells the story of the Irish lad Redmond Barry and his way to the ""top"". The steps he takes to reach it, and the outcomes of his decisions, the wrong ones and the right ones.  Every shot in this movie is pure magic. Every thing is right in its place and it takes you back to the 18th century like no movie before did.
What I personally love about the movie is the way Barry kept changing in my eyes. The first part I felt sympathie for him and his strugel but after the intermission that completly changend and I hoped something awfull would happend to him and when it happend I felt sympathie all over again.So please  go get it (dont rent you want to see it at least twice).

Having visited Europe sometime back, I was almost felt like I was back! Excellent cinematography, tight screenplay, good acting.The movie according to me is an excellent example for the 'treatment' of the subject. The story in itself sounded quite ordinary to me.

396,Kubrickian007,Arguably the Greatest Film Ever Made,10,24 February 2003,"As a huge fan of Kubrick, I am dissappointed that, at least here in the U.S., this film is underappreciated. Although it lacks the social commentary of ""Clockwork Orange"" and the philosophy of ""2001"", I think that this is By Far Kubrick's most beautiful masterpiece. The sets, costumes, and especially cinematography are all utterly amazing. Every single shot is new and wonderful and most of all Memorable. From the opening shot of Barry's father and another man dueling, to the masterful final scene of Lady Lyndon, every aspect of this film is magnificant. In fact, a true connoisseur of cinema can almost sense the overwhelming skill and genius that went into making this film. The acting is very good, not great because the script did not require much acting skill as the narrator of the film gives away practically every event before it happens. I think that this film stands alone as the most beautiful film ever produced, and it alone would qualify Kubrick as one of the greatest directors of all time.",Barry Lyndon
397,universalmyth,This is not a good movie,6,1 February 2013,"Stanley Kubrick is well known and perhaps the best director of Hollywood or perhaps the whole world, but Barry Lyndon is not a great movie. The very concept of a movie is to entertain people through any means; whether it's through thrill, or suspense or emotions or drama or comedy or any out of the world experience which this movie ain't contain a bit. It's a stale British Setup with monotonous narration and a presentation that seems to resemble that of a History Channel (or NGC). There's no craziness and spikes in the movie and the viewers remain quite aloof of what's happening. There's no strong flavor of good or evil, happy or sad but it's just long, boring and gloomy life of the main character. It seems Kubrick really became bored while living on outskirts of London, the psyche of which being shown through this film. Film creates sensations, and simply don't present the very mediocrity plain life which most of people usually are going through. This is one of the movies in which Kubrick became too lazy to even go to sets to direct it. Just cameraman, actors and writers flipped it by themselves. It's better to go for some other movie than this one.",Barry Lyndon

I love the fact that none of the players are either evil or angels but are ""real"". I can't think of another movie that puts you into the period and keeps you there so well. Especially the last act, which I believe is the best. I didn't always pick up on the fact that many of the scenes were taken from actual paintings but when you watch it with that in mind it brings a new level of appreciation. Anyway, read the more informed reviews but take a chance and a rainy afternoon to really enjoy this movie.

There is just one point about it that I'd like to comment on, and that is Kubrick's choice of Ryan O'Neal as the actor to play Barry. O'Neal was a good actor but he was not suitable for this part. Few Americans can play the role of a European well. Someone like Malcolm McDowell or Richard Harris or some other Irish or English actor would have been a much better choice. Kubrick may well have picked O'Neal as a draw for the movie-going public. Having said that the film is otherwise a brilliant creation.",Barry Lyndon
402,mnandame,Neither Masterpiece Nor Disaster,7,15 July 2011,"Seems like opinion is of 2 camps: it's an unsung masterpiece, or an utter disaster. Why can't the truth lie in between? Film is long, but not as slow as I'd heard - there's a lot of story. And some of the sequences are just fantastic; also there's more humor than you'd expect. Still it all adds up to little. The film doesn't particularly make you think, and it sure as hell doesn't make you care.The problem is Barry/O'Neill at the center of it is vacuous, vaguely unlikeable and unforgivably dumb. By the end I was kind of rooting for him to get shot. I love O'Neill in ""Paper Moon"" & ""What's Up Doc,"" but he's so horribly miscast here it's painful. I was racking my brains to think of who could have played Barry and concluded it was a shame Daniel Day Lewis hadn't been discovered just a few years earlier to do it. It's a fun party game, but just a shame. No doubt a different Barry would have made it a different and likely better movie.I somehow doubt that this was Mr. Kubrick's intention, but my main takeaway was that men are basically pretty awful, ugly, brutish animals with bulging, ungainly pouches in their pants. Not that the women come off much better, but they get a lot less screen time.",Barry Lyndon

The movie is beautiful, and many have negative criticisms about the main character, but i think thats one of the points in this movie. The main character (as opposed to 95% of movies) is not allowed to overshadow the movie itself. His character gets more interesting (or uninteresting) in retrospect of the movie itself.

406,auldrinm,Stunning,10,1 November 2004,"Stanley Kubrik's 18th century drama about a young Irish roguewho travels through Europe with various armies during the SevenYears War is a stunning masterpiece that provides scenery andsounds that overwhelm the moviegoers' senses. Redmond Barry,played by Ryan O'Neal, is a tragic character in his youngadulthood who is forced to enlist in the British army, deserts, istaken in by Britain's allies, the Prussians, and through theopportunities afforded to him as a spy for the Prussian armymoves up the social ladder and nearly attains the title of Lord BarryLyndon. However, he cannot fully escape his past and suffers forhis wrong doings. The story is quite compelling despite its longand drawn out format. But what makes the piece so unique andthrilling for the movie enthusiasts is the way it is presented visuallyand musically.The way Kubrik depicts the European landscapes through deepfocus shots and high camera angles is stunning to say the least. The camera captures the unspoiled beauty of picturesquevillages, and the rolling country hills of the European farmlands. Kubrik also displays fantastic shots of palace courtyards thatplace the viewer in the lap of an aristocratic era when luxury andlavishness where at a pinnacle. In addition to the extraordinaryexterior shots are the unique interior shots beyond there time ininnovativeness. Kubrik used a special lens developed by NASA toshoot much of the films interior shots in natural lighting. Thisgives the movie watcher a real sense of being inside of an18thpalace playing cards by candlelight with Patrick Magee'scharacter, the Chevalier de Balibari (http://www.imdb.com/title/ tt0072684/trivia).The other facet of Barry Lyndon that made it so powerful formyself was the use of music, particularly surrounding the LadyLyndon, played by Marisa Berenson. When Lady Lyndon is firstintroduced she is accompanied by a certain score of music thatfits her character remarkably well. The music continues as sheand Barry have their first liaison on a palace porch. As the coupleshared their first kiss there is a dramatic pause in the beat of thesong and their movement seems to almost echo the song as ifthey were performing a dance. As the movie progresses thesame score is repeated at dramatic moments in Lady Lyndon'slife and is playing at the conclusion of the film at a moment whenshe is obviously reflecting on her past with the Irish scoundrel.The combination of visual creativeness and an understanding ofthe power of music are two of Kubrik's trademarks as a director. Visually Barry Lyndon can only be compared to the spectacularouterspace shots of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and musically it ison par with the dramatic scoring of A Clockwork Orange.",Barry Lyndon
407,euanaharris,Kubrick's Best,10,21 November 2018,"Having been a Kubrick fan for almost as long as I can remember being into films, this was a film I had always heard about, but was quite hard to find. Stories of it's gorgeous shots and wonderful characters and dialogue, not to mention it's slow, almost methodical, pacing convinced me that the big screen was the way to watch it. When the chance finally came around, I jumped at the opportunity, and wasn't disappointed.What a film! Barry is at times funny, endearing and cruel, but always interesting. His rise, and subsequent fall, is perhaps the best that the rise and fall narrative has been done in film, the second half of the film eerily mirroring the events of the first. Neal's performance is terrific too, allowing us to draw many of our own conclusions about Barry, while also having enough about him to stand out as his own man. By the time the end of the film comes round, you can't help but feel for the man we've spent the last 3 hours with.The length is also something that has it's importance. Many will see it and be put off, and in the hands of a lesser director it may be noticeable, but Kubrick takes us through this world so brilliantly, with stunning shot after stunning shot, and a story that is both satirical and celebratory. He shows the greed, pomposity and arrogance, while also acknowledging the beauty and elegance. Never before have I wanted to go back in time while watching a film the way I did here. I hardly even noticed the time going by, a testament to Kubrick's pacing, because I just wanted to spend as much time as possible in the fantastic locations, listening to the litany of characters. It is a lived in film, feeling like a world that existed prior to our viewing, and one that will exist long after we have left it.If you ask me, this is Kubrick's masterpiece (and that is stiff competition it is up against). If you can, watch it on the big screen and marvel at the candlelit interiors, vast green landscapes and ostentatious estates. It is honestly like walking through an art museum - the painting like shots can be both intimate and grand at the same time. I've since re-watched it multiple times, and it is just as affecting on a small screen. If you've got three hours, sit and immerse yourself in this world... you won't regret it.",Barry Lyndon
408,christsandwich,A Really Beautiful Film,10,10 November 2013,"Some people say that this is Kubrick's unsuccessful film, but as a huge Kubrick fan, I say this is his most beautiful film. I have watched all Kubrick's but I love Barry Lyndon the most.The ScenesThe scenes are wonderfully made, it's like looking at moving 18th century paintings. I can feel the atmosphere in every scenes, as if I were there. Sure there are some errors in the scenes (the Frenchmen reload too quickly in Barry's first battle) but it doesn't ruin the whole point and simply tolerable. The scenes are also filled with beautiful soundtrack.The PlotThe story is based on a book and it feels so deep. It's not about hero saving the world or about an unstoppable villain, it's about a young man, confused, struggling for his survival in every misfortunes, and how his fate has shaped him into a different person. A realistic story of how hardships and struggles can turn a common man into an opportunist. The main character is so human, unlike many other stories where the main character is a person of infinite bravery and chivalry.The EmotionThe staring, the kissing, all done beautifully and with purposes. I can feel the emotion in the staring, kissing, and conversations. The emotional details play important part, different with many film nowadays where kissing and sex scenes are useless and have no relation with the plot at all. ConclusionBeautiful piece of cinema art. Good film even in nowadays standard. Many modern viewers don't like it because it's long, no CGI, no shallow humour, no patriotic theme, no doctrine, no senseless fighting and waste of human life. But those are not the main elements of a film. A film is good as long as it is entertaining and tells interesting story.",Barry Lyndon

Also; if when you are watching a movie, you put yourself in place of the man in the head role, than misfortunes will disrupt your nerves and upset you. This is a very positive recommendation.

The battle scenes, though brief, are superbly done, conveying a true sense that history is another country, and in this one men marched and fought shoulder to shoulder, loading and firing at preposterously close range with an indifference to death and maiming that we would find unspeakable. But thus it was, and Kubrik does it *properly*, with superb attention to detail, rendering some of the most realistic 18th century battle scenes ever filmed, leaving movies like Waterloo or the Patriot in the dust.There's an elegance and rhythm to this movie that draws you in, intrigues you, and keeps you watching long past bedtime. How often can you watch three hours of movie, then find yourself checking your watch to see if it would be really preposterous to just hit the 'play' button again?

411,steelywinston,"Kubrick revisits the misapplication of money, status and class",10,1 August 2005,"Having watched this film ( Barry Lyndon )amongst all his others at least once a year, it has become apparent to me that Stanley Kubrick was fascinated with the insidious marriage of ambition and money, however beautiful his films were;( and they ARE beautiful, despite the apparent contradiction between a world gone wrong and the beauty that is there despite this - what a visionary!). All the misguided or malevolent protagonists of his films are male: they kill, lie, cheat, abuse, brag, swagger, dismiss, inveigle, assume superiority by virtue of social standing, hate and blame others for their own predicament, feel better when they look upon a lesser person and relegate women to, at best, the role of a social Geisha;- at worst, the parasitic whore that Mommy and Daddy always warned us about, portrayed through the eyes of the 'rational' male with all of his virtues listed above. All of the influential characters are male. Witness the dreadfully violent social scramble of The Killing; the technocratic monetarist showdown of 2001; the rape, violence and feel good factor of the Droogs; the damning indictment of social climbing and the class system based on wealth in Barry Lyndon; the locked-in familial violence of The Shining with its blame apportioned to the woman, the child and the African - American,- everyone except Jack himself; the controlling male class in Eyes Wide Shut* with its assumption that ANYTHING can be bought (the bottomless wallet), the interchangeable women as objects of desire,(literally,as actors, and metaphorically - the two Mandys - one live and one a corpse), male irritation at a woman's ability to make him feel inadequate unless he can possess, buy, control, or dispose of them (ref: Zeigler and drugs OD, implied murder; corruption; procuring women for sex etc.); and, of course, the ultimate irritation and social embarrassment - death. What could be more inconvenient than your little woman having the gall to die on you? Note too the blithe acceptance of Imperialism manifested in the form of a compliant reporter and apologist for American Foreign Policy as displayed by Pvt. Joker, the grinning indifferent witness whose complicity and desire for male acceptance allows him to shoot an injured woman dead and secretly congratulate himself on his humanitarianism. Note too, the use of actors twice, as if to hammer the point home - Joe Turkel, Sterling Hayden, Philip Stone, Leonard Rossiter, Peter Sellers, James Mason, Pat Roach** et al: all insidiously wicked and manipulative, or just plain dumb, their thoughts, misapprehensions and lies communicated softly, violently or socially correctly, often wrapped in a banknote. Social acceptability can even be granted to a paedophile if he's 'acceptable' or rich enough. This remarkable director knew EXACTLY what to do with the greatest art form that the 20th century gave us - his legacy is a unique insight into the human condition and the state of male Western morality through the medium of cinema. I have barely scraped the surface of his art - for this, I cannot apologise enough. Edward de Bono says that, 'A powerful way of treating opposing ideas is to suppose that each one is correct under certain circumstances'...Alas, Stanley Kubrick could see straight through such fallacies and demonstrate the endemic social and political hypocrisy and corruption of the world we tolerate with consummate ease through the medium he loved and we continue to love. How do you thank somebody for such a legacy? Incidentally, the great film writer and critic Michel Ciment compared 'Eyes Wide Shut' to a late Rembrandt. What a masterpiece of understatement, as I'm sure he'd agree. I certainly hope he does - I don't want to be pounded into hamburger in some ritual of film critic's machismo should we ever meet!!! But I flatter myself - I'm just an enthusiast in august company.Mike Winston, Birmingham, U.K.* See' Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy' by John le Carre for the possible origin of this unusual phrase.** The late Pat Roach - A resident of Erdington, Birmingham, U.K. and a true gentleman, sadly missed by everyone who knew him. R.I.P.P.S. Don't forget to push your Kodakchrome at least one stop for beautiful saturation - just a thought!",Barry Lyndon
412,nicolukas93,One of the most beautiful films of Kubrick,10,5 May 2020,"I got the chance to watch this film in a beautiful 35mm print in Paris. I was hit by a wave of emotions, colors and almost perfect camera movements. I believe that with this film you can really notice the mastery of Kubrick.
People tend to talk a lot about 2001: A Space Odyssey or about A Clockwork Orange, or even about Full Metal Jacket, but I think Barry Lyndon is his most visually beautiful film alongside with 2001: A Space Odyssey, the problem with this last movie of his, is that is so profoundly important in film history that it is so hard not to say that it is his most important work.
Personally the film of Stanley that I love the most is Eyes Wide Shut, the most important from him is 2001: A Space Odyssey, but the one that I think is his masterpiece and the one with which he showed his search for perfection, has to be Barry Lyndon.",Barry Lyndon
413,bjjonesmls,This movie is faithful to the book but that is not a recommendation for either,1,14 November 2005,"This is the slowest, most tedious movie I have ever seen. I was a junior English major when it was released and we were studying the book. When the movie came to our theater in 1975 my whole class went to see it. We all thought that the movie was as boring as the book and we had gone to see it because the book was so boring we wanted to avoid finishing it. In one scene you watch a horse's hoof trot for what seems to be at least 5 minutes and this has nothing to do with the plot. It wasn't until I saw this listing that I learned the movie was thought to be Oscar material. Frankly, I didn't see it. Ryan O'Neal played a person who lacked character and the portrayal lacked spirit. Of course, now that I know this is a Kubrick film I do understand the boredom, it matches 2001.",Barry Lyndon
414,rogene-38374,Perfection,10,12 May 2019,"I am often asked to describe my perfect film .. the answer is always Barry Lyndon ... not a scene out of place. Dialogue and script written with depth wit and intelligence, lean and taut direction, exquisite photography and superlative acting by the entire cast ... a perfect film",Barry Lyndon
415,flambee000,Don't waste your time.,2,25 November 2005,"One thing that has always impressed me about Stanley Kubrick's films is the strong characters in each. In every movie of his that I've seen, there has always been one character that I feel a strong liking for, whether he is Jack in ""The Shining"" or Alex in ""A Clockwork Orange"", or even HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". However, this film is the exception to the rule.The main character, promising Redmond Barry, eventually degenerates into the pomposity of high society, putting his wealthy wife into debt in order to gain lordship under the advice of his once-good mother. At best, the film's plot is a warning against the evils of wealth. At it's very worst, it is a poor choice of novels for Mr. Kubrick to adapt onto the screen. The characters are static and boring, the plot disappointing, and the actors pitiful.Forget the so-called subtlety of Ryan O'Neal. Forget the cinematic power that Stanley Kubrick holds over his fans. This film is not worth your time. It is too long, with too many plot points, for not enough reward at the end. The only reason why I even bothered to finish the movie was because I was waiting for the typical Kubrick edginess to come in and rescue the film the boring path it was leading me down. That edginess never came.With no strong hero, and no strong villain, none of the characters spark enough interest in it's viewers to get them emotionally wrapped in the movie. A complete waste of two and a half hours.",Barry Lyndon
416,kennethpoppe,Saw this for the first time last night on VHS. My interpretation.,9,16 July 2016,"This was way different than anything i might have expected. This story could relate to any man, on so many levels. To me, that is both the charm and the fear this director was going for. Barry is clearly on a set path of delusion, where he feels complete control even though he clearly has none. He has moments of victory and shame. The movie shows the ups and downs of a seemingly good person to the people around him. Until he reached a point where he was exposed as a common man in a wealthy surrounding. Thus, setting a path of little respect for his actions or identity. At the same time, you want to feel for him as the main character much like his wife does.Watching the white faces, real costumes, camera angles, and superb lighting was so unique. The story was told in a passive way, with so many plot points happening gently and without much dialogue.I'm in a funk today because that movie got under my skin somehow. The idea of watching it again makes me weary because the details to consider are infinite.",Barry Lyndon
417,nod1111rog,I agree with Scorcese,10,22 September 2006,"Martin Scorcese reportedly considers this to be Kubrick's best film. I must agree, and I would say it's his best by some fair margin. I've never seen a film with photography that even begins to approach that in Barry Lyndon. But everyone mentions the photography. The three things that most decisively set this film apart from all of Kubrick's others and really haven't been mentioned enough are its enormous heart, its uncompromising spirit, and the way it seems to suspend time over and over again, simultaneously standing still yet flowing along easily, almost breathlessly. If you watch it expecting A Clockwork Orange or The Shining, you'll be very disappointed and may end up calling it long and boring, but if you set aside an entire evening and surrender yourself totally to its magic, I swear you'll be looking for yourself in Stunland a few hours later. I's time to treat yourself to Barry Lyndon. You may be shocked at discovering what's been there for so long.",Barry Lyndon
418,cameronlarocque,Kubrick's Lost Treasure: Barry Lyndon,10,12 December 2017,"Many casual movie fans can rattle off some films by the acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick. Movies such as The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and 2001: A Space Odyssey might come to mind when one thinks of Kubrick's filmography, but most overlook what is perhaps his most beautifully shot film: Barry Lyndon. Formed in the wake of Kubrick's derailed movie about the life of Napoleon, he decided to use the resources and knowledge he had accumulated to develop William Makepeace Thackeray's novel, The Luck of Barry Lyndon. A period-piece film set in late 18th century Europe, Kubrick spares no expense on the realism that was necessary to capture the viewer's attention. Everything was shot on location, and the gorgeous costumes were designed after attire that would have been worn at the time. Despite its slow pace, Barry Lyndon is a film that immerses the viewer into dazzling scenery and a stunning tale of human experience.
 The film begins with a poor Irish boy named Redmond Barry, portrayed by Ryan O'Neal, trying to win the affection of his cousin Nora. After Nora is promised to marry Captain John Quinn, Redmond challenges him to an illegal duel, resulting in Quinn's apparent death. Redmond begins a life on the run from the law, and finds his way into the British army. Briefly fighting during the Seven Years War, Redmond deserts from the army and goes on a series of adventures that eventually lead to his marriage to the wealthy widow, Lady Lyndon. Having taken his wife's last name, Barry has everything he could possibly want. Barry's wealth and happiness get the better of him as he is irresponsible and reckless with money, leading to his climactic downfall.
 Kubrick designs a world where the actors and actresses do not need to be extravagant to make an impact. Ryan O'Neal is often criticized for his cold and emotionless performance as Barry Lyndon; however, these viewers might be missing the big picture. Like most protagonists in Kubrick films, Barry was not meant to be a character the viewer roots for. He is not a hero; he is simply a man who makes advancements and mistakes. Barry could not have been portrayed any other way; otherwise the film would lose its unbiased tone. All of the characters have little dialogue, another Kubrick trademark. Marisa Berenson, who played Lady Lyndon, got the second billing for the film, but only had thirteen lines of dialogue. While this might add to the slow pace, it helps viewers to focus on the beautiful scenes and sets featured throughout the film.
 One constant technique Kubrick incorporated into Barry Lyndon was designing scenes in a similar fashion to the paintings of William Hogarth: an artist who lived during the time in which the film was set. Not only do these scenes add to the surreal beauty of the film, but the aesthetic makes the viewer feel as though they are looking at an art piece rather than a moving picture. Kubrick wanted the film to look so natural that he shot many scenes using only candlelight. It was too difficult for a regular camera to pick up, so Kubrick had a special lens made by NASA to properly pick up the light source. The scenes that use candlelight are remembered as some of the most ravishing in cinema history. 
Barry Lyndon was not commercially successful due to a three hour run time, slow pace, and minimal dialogue. Anyone looking for a historical action film should stay away, as Barry Lyndon lacks the tenacity that would provide satisfaction. Having said that, Barry Lyndon appeals to those who want to see a realistic period-piece that requires a deep level of thinking to properly interpret and assess the events and characters in the film. Fans of Kubrick's other work will likely enjoy this well. A breathtaking, artsy film like Barry Lyndon will likely be remembered by those who watch it regardless of enjoying it or not.",Barry Lyndon
419,rene_clover,Masterful every step of the way,10,22 June 2021,"The film perfectly captures the many misadventures of its main protagonists across his entire life with a terrific sense of style and presentation. Every aspect of the visual department shines like a diamond while simultaneously enhancing the events in the story with insurmountable beauty and detail and great focus on character and emotion.The music was delightful, the acting was precise wherever it was necessary, and the plot was perfectly structured. I doubt there's a single thing in this movie that misses its mark and I continuedly fell into the story of Barry Lyndon which doesn't cease to impress in its presentation even after the film ends.I hate writing reviews about this type of movies because I recognize missing the necessary knowledge to properly describe their perfection. But it suffices to say films with this level of talent and precision are scarce and always welcome for every piece of their narrative and cinematic achievemnt. Impressive film.",Barry Lyndon
