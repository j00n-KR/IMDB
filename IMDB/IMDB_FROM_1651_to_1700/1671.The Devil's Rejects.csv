0,SnoopyStyle,great B-movie characters,7,6 January 2014,"On May 18, 1978. The Ruggsville County police led by Sheriff John Quincy Wydell raided a run down farmhouse owned by the Firefly family (The Devil's Reject). After a deadly shootout, mother Firefly is captured, but Otis B. Driftwood (Bill Moseley) and Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie) escape. They kidnap a group of singers. Then reunite with the crazy clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) for a final showdown with the cops.Rob Zombie certainly has the style and the grotesque correct. He creates these utterly convincing low lifes of unimaginable depravity. Sid Haig is unforgettable in his clown makeup. This is more than the usual low budget slasher flick. This is B-movie heaven. This is certainly not a movie for everyone, but it's a great movie for those who love the genre.",The Devil's Rejects
1,claudio_carvalho,Sadism and Violence,6,28 June 2007,"In Ruggsville, Texas, the police under the command of Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe) attack the house of the sadistic serial killers Firefly family (a.k.a. The Devil's Reject) and they arrest mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook), but Otis B. Driftwood (Bill Moseley) and Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie) escape from the siege. Tiny (Matthew McGrory) is wandering nearby the house and also escapes. Otis and Baby call their patriarch, the mad clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) and they schedule to reunite at an isolated motel in the desert. When Otis and Baby arrive, they kidnap two families of singers, using sadism and violence against the harmless persons. Meanwhile, Sheriff Wydell promises to capture and kill the runaways, seeking revenge for the death of his brother, the Deputy George Wydell.""The Devil's Reject"" is an extremely sadistic and violent sequel of ""House of 1000 Corpses"", with the deranged Otis and Baby using the most different type of torture against their victims. Even the Sheriff Wydell becomes insane and also uses extreme cruelty against the despicable family to revenge the death of his brother in his predictable fate. There are many citations to many classics and the conclusion is à la"" Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". The soundtrack is a plus in this sick film, highlighting Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"". My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Rejeitados Pelo Diabo"" (""Rejected by the Devil"")",The Devil's Rejects
2,kosmasp,"Good beginning, but falls short in the End",5,20 April 2006,"I want to begin with the End. The End of the movie that is. I saw this movie in a theatre and was more than disappointed by it(the end of the movie). It becomes more funny when you then listen to the ""AC"" Track from the director on the DVD. He says that the last impression is what stays with the viewer. And not only did he make it(the ending) too long, but he gave the Firefly family some heroic moments (throughout the movie) that they didn't deserve (in my eyes). Call me old-fashioned, but a family who just kills for fun, won't get any cheering from me.Test Audiences loved the family (as the Crew AC points out on the DVD again) and cheered for them. Which is kind of disturbing, I think. The movie starts light-toned, but in one (Hotel) scene it gets very dark. And it's not so much about the physical violence in that scene as it is about the humiliation and psychological terror. The movie switches it's mood for some time and that ""hurts"" ... the movie (and it should hurt the viewer too).From then on it gets lighter again and you can enjoy and laugh with the characters. That is until the demise of one of the ""good guys"", who turns out to be a psycho. He's hunting the family and if you know your movies you kinda guess what is going to happen (to whom). It's inevitable, but nevertheless I didn't want ""it"" to happen. But the movie tops all that with a never-ending ... ending. At least that's what I felt when I watched the movie. The ending is just wrong (morally speaking, but also in it's length, it is something that you can't bare).That were the ""bad parts"", but in between you have a nice ""sick"" road movie, that could have been better. The acting is nice (for such a movie) and there a many ""famous"" faces (from movies such as ""The Hills have Eyes"" - Original, ""Dawn of the Dead"" - Original and so forth) for the movie buffs out there. :o) It's a shame then, but the sour feeling is what's left after watching this movie (at least for me it was that way)",The Devil's Rejects
3,gavin6942,"Unlike HoKC, Not a Reject",7,9 February 2006,"Otis, Baby and Captain Spaulding are wanted by the police for the killings from ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and several other murders not shown. But they don't take capture lying down. They do what any murderous family would do, and go on a cross-country killing spree. Let me say I saw ""House of 1000 Corpses"" in the theater and purchased the DVD when it came out, despite not really caring for the film. I am a long-standing fan of Rob Zombie, but this film made me feel like his vast horror knowledge was wasted. It was a poor ripoff of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, plain and simple. So I was a little bit scared about the sequel. But my fears were wrong.This film takes the psychological depravity to a whole new level. I could compare the motel scene featuring Priscilla Barnes with ""Last House on the Left"", but ""Rejects"" probably went even farther than ""Last House"" did in certain ways. I was glued to the screen, but knew at the same time it's something I hoped I'd never see. It was shock. And the gore is amazing. Blood everywhere, and one ""explosive"" part you will never see in another movie.What makes this film really interesting are the humorous pieces thrown in. The ice cream store is light-hearted, and the scene about the chicken-fornicating is downright hilarious. Add some great B-movie actors (Danny Trejo, EG Daily, and Priscilla Barnes) and you have a classic. Lew Temple, Ken Foree and Michael Berryman are here. Kane Hodder and PJ Soles even make brief appearances. It was a virtually who's who of the current horror scene.By the end of the movie you'll find yourself actually cheering on the bad guys. This may be in part to the great use of the soundtrack -- 1970s songs to fit the 1970s filming style, and placed in ways that carry the picture rather than just sell albums. And believe me, whether you love them or despise them, the end is very satisfying and the perfect way to end the trail of mayhem this film allows us to be voyeur to. For horror fans, recommended! For weak stomachs or those with morals, stay away!",The Devil's Rejects
4,ma-cortes,Gory sequel plenty of horrible events and cruel murders,5,8 April 2010,"Since the presentation the killer family executes some series of body-count scabrously and cruelly carried out. It happens a little while after the killings of the people from previous film titled 'House of 1000 corpses' . The Firefly family who become known as 'The Devil's rejects' must escape their home because it is besieged by police. Capt. Spaulding (Sid Haig) meets up with Baby (Sherry Moon married to Rob Zombie) and Otis (Bill Moseley) to find a hiding place that results to be a Motel . Meanwhile, Officer Whydel (William Forsythe), Sheriff Whydel's brother seeks avenge on the Firefly . Whydel gets to detain Mother Firefly(Leslie Easterbrook replacing Karen Black) and he takes the law on his own hands. The family undergoes a criminal rampage and one of them sports a skin-mask and executes an interminable body-count.This chiller contains grisly killings, disturbing horror, scabrous violence, shocking, nudism and lots of blood and gore. The horrible assassinations are extremely gory and nauseatingly violent with abundant shots showing stabbing, punch,beheading and gruesome deeds. The best scenes of the movie turn out to be the final images when the family driving a car takes on police with a wonderful song as musical background . The film is a spine-tingler shocker that has grisly horror,suspense,terrifying screams,tense,shocks, gratuitous gore, and great loads of blood and guts . Captain Spaulding, Otis and Baby make a real massacre and are utilized in the gruesome and nauseating killings all kind of means as knife,cleaver, club and brute force originating a gory slaughter.From the beginning to end the horror and terror is continued and varied . Appears a plethora of secondary actors, as Geoffrey Lewis, Priscila Barnes and Steve Railsback, as cult's actors( as Michael Berryman,Kane Hodder, Ken Foree of 'Dawn of the dead'), cameos( Daniel Roebuck,Danny Trejo, PJ Soles, Mary Woronov,Taylor Maine ) and Rod Zombie's usual(Bill Moseley,Sid Haig, Sherry Moon),among others. The picture is dedicated to Matthew McGrory (Tiny) who died during filming. Habitual Rob Zombie's musician, Tyler Bates, composes a good musical score adding beautiful songs. This following is much better than first entry ¨ House of 1000 corpses¨ and is professionally directed by Rob Zombie, he's a nice musician , writer ,producer and director of terror movies as ¨Hallowen I and II¨ .",The Devil's Rejects
5,BA_Harrison,Brilliant and disturbing - a modern horror masterpiece!,10,15 February 2006,"Rob Zombie takes the murderous clan of misfits he introduced us to in House of 1000 Corpses and runs with them, giving us a truly sickening yet totally engrossing masterpiece of cinematic horror.Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) and his family of psychos continue to kill, maim and torture just about everyone they meet, in spectacularly gruesome and gory ways. These lunatics are a fantastic mix of OTT characters  The Captain himself is a bear of a man with rotten teeth and scary clown makeup; Otis (Bill Moseley) is a lank-haired screwball with more than one screw loose; Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) is as barking mad and sadistic as she is beautiful; Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is just plain crazy; and Tiny (Matthew McGrory), well, Tiny isn't tiny at all.Out to bring these killers to Justice is Sheriff Wydell, a tough cop with a score to settle. Almost as mad as the fugitives he is chasing, Wydell will do anything to end their trail of violence.Rob Zombie's script is brimming with great characterisation, dialogue and action, and his direction is inventive without being too showy. This film is a great improvement on his debut. He has brought together a brilliant cast to flesh out his outlandish creations  in particular, William Forsythe is superb as Wydell, gradually becoming more and more unhinged the closer he gets to (hopefully) fulfilling his destiny.Geoffrey Lewis, Danny Trejo, P.J. Soles, Ken Foree, Michael Berryman, and ex-pornstar Ginger Lynn Allen also star in great supporting roles.As the films draws to its close, I had the horrible feeling that Zombie might ruin an otherwise perfect cinematic experience with a cop-out ending  but his clever script doesn't disappoint, giving us a logical, satisfying and brilliantly memorable conclusion.",The Devil's Rejects
6,paul_haakonsen,"I am the devil, and I am here to do the devil's work...",7,9 June 2018,"While this sequel to ""House of 1000 corpses"" is nowhere near as extreme or absurd as its predecessor, then it is still a very enjoyable movie both as a sequel, but also as a stand-alone movie.It was nice to revisit Otis, Baby, Mama and Spaulding again and follow them on their homicidal roadtrip of sorts. Despite they didn't have Karen Black return to reprise the role as Mama Firefly.The story in ""The Devil's Rejects"" is straight forward and quite entertaining.It is a shame that the usual Rob Zombie imagery is toned down in this movie, because it was definitely what made ""House of 1000 Corpses"" so unique in its visual presentation.""The Devil's Rejects"" is crammed with lots of performances from a bunch of very unique and talented performers, and if you are a movie fan then you will see a lot of familiar faces throughout this thrill ride.This movie is not quite as brutal as its predecessor either, but it was a nice take on it to show a different side to the characters while still keeping that maniacal edge and twist to them.If you enjoyed ""House of 1000 Corpses"" then you will definitely also enjoy ""The Devil's Rejects"".",The Devil's Rejects
7,Quinoa1984,"I got pretty much what I expected- slightly improved film-making from Zombie's first film, but...",7,22 July 2005,"...that goes without saying that it isn't by a lot. In a way, Rob Zombie's second film, 'The Devil's Rejects', affected me the same way his music does- it's usually self-indulgent, stylized like it's nobody's business, and at times its fairly entertaining stuff, but you know while you're listening to it there's better material in the genre. His first film, 'House of 1000 Corpses', was below average for my tastes, as he reveled in the fact that he was a writer/director of a horror film by making a Oliver Stone-esquire pastiche of the genre. This time around, he goes for a more conventional narrative, though saying that one must take into account that its in the framework of a raw, un-hinged, demented, exploitation crime film. So, there are some good points about it, if muddled under by the flaws.As with 'Corpses', the film is style over substance, or story- the characters from the last film, the 'Fireflies' (led by Sid Haig, in a cheerfully disturbing performance), are on the lam from Texas troopers, most particularly the vengeful Sheriff (played by William Forsythe, overplayed for good and bad results) who'll stop at nothing to see they pay for their crimes. On the way to hideout among friends (one of which Ken Foree, one of several obvious nods Zombie makes to past exploitation/horror films with cameos and small parts), they continue the carnage. While watching the film though, one isn't as concerned with any real story as much as just the atmosphere, the fiends and victims who populate this late 1970's hillbilly environment Zombie has sprung up.The good parts are these- Zombie shows himself to be fairly adept at writing scathingly (and I mean scathingly like a iron to the face) witty dialog at times, mostly tongue-in-cheek, and has moments of inspired wild-ness in his style. He also has the good knowledge to let his actors go as nuts as possible, which helps at times to heighten the mood. But this leads into the bad sides of the film, one which some won't be bothered by (mostly die-hards I'd figure to exploitation flicks of the 70's) and some may be even more repulsed by than me: the Fireflys are, by Zombie's manipulation, by default the most sympathetic characters of the movie (when compared to the 'evil' police that is, and the innocuous victims). The problem is, despite some attempts to make them charming by some stretch, to get a viewer on the side of the anti-heroes, he doesn't succeed on this level.During parts of the film, including the ending scene (I won't reveal it, but to give an idea of the scene it's done with Skynyrd's 'Free Bird' blaring out), I started to think about another filmmaker who's gone in the realm of the take-no-prisoners, on the side of the outlaws film-making, Quentin Tarantino. He's not a filmmaker immune to criticism, but in the sort of side-world he's created with From Dusk till Dawn and the Kill Bill films (connected by some similar characters) the anti-heroes have a kind of balance with their more sadistic and 'bad' side to get a viewer rooting for them almost. Zombie is so in love with his style of film-making and these people he's created, that he doesn't realize that these aren't very charming people at all (bullies and children almost all the way through), and as the film heads towards a climax, it's hard to really root for anyone. Maybe that's the point, as a satire, but I just didn't get it, and by the big finale on a road in Texas, the whole experience of the film felt a little, well, average when in regards to the other 'shock' films Zombie pays tribute to.In short, the excesses that Zombie went with in 'Corpses' have sort of lingered on in 'Rejects', and while there are some curious and 'cool' bits scattered about (along with a very good classic/souther-rock soundtrack), it becomes a little boring at times too. I'm sure after this film that Zombie may make more movies, better ones perhaps, but with 'Rejects' he has made an uncompromising, violent, torrid, amusing, and ludicrous work here that does everything to call attention to itself...akin to his solo music work. It's the kind of film I can recommend more to some than others.",The Devil's Rejects
8,wes-connors,Gross out for Captain Spalding,5,22 May 2016,"A prelude informs, ""On May 18th, 1978, Sheriff John Quincey Wydell along with local authorities in Ruggsville County led a 'search and destroy' mission on a decaying farmhouse. Inside the house, police discovered a collection of diaries and scrapbook detailing the accounts of more than seventy-five murders. The family responsible for these brutal crimes was forever to be known as 'The Devil's Rejects',"" The lurid opening scenes invite questions about the Devil's decision to reject this group of cutthroats, who continue their sadistic violence from ""House of 1000 Corpses"" (2003). Probably, we are meant to think they are so bad, even the Devil wouldn't have them. So, it's here they stay...Mainly, we follow black-toothed Sid Haig (as Captain Spaulding), sexy blonde Sheri Moon Zombie (as ""Baby"" Firefly) and demented Bill Moseley (as Otis P. Driftwood). Yes, the names are swiped from Marx Brothers movies, with Groucho's image appearing a couple of times. It's an interesting and potentially plot intriguing homage that adds up to practically nothing... There is very little plot. This film also misses its connection with a bigger picture. ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" artfully succeeded by shoving society in your eyes and down your throat. ""The Devil's Rejects"" does a lot of shaky camera shoving, but doesn't strike the chords. The script has some clever lines, but consists mostly of a four-letter word that rhymes with luck...From ""Midnight Rider"" (the Allman Brothers) to ""Free Bird"" (Lynyrd Skynyrd), the music, helps put you in a party mood. This was not done by Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch and Quentin Tarantino with ""Singin' in the Rain"" (via ""A Clockwork Orange""), ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" (via ""Reservoir Dogs""). They struck the notes that crept you out...The clown role played by Mr. Haig is the closest writer-director Rob Zombie comes to touching the nerves. More should have been made of his TV program. Have mobs of kids adore him. Show us his fan mail. Drive the ""Love-Hate"" relationship between violence and American society home. Haig's intro is the film's highlight. While not especially horrific, it is gross and unpredictable. Love the edit from urination to pouring coffee. Points for the dirty pot, too. The dirty texture in sets and locations is a plus. Other characterizations are one-note, through a few hit it adequately. Former ""Three's Company"" star Priscilla Barnes gets a special shout-out for versatility, endurance and always giving her all.***** The Devil's Rejects (7/22/2005) Rob Zombie ~ Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, Sheri Moon Zombie, William Forsythe",The Devil's Rejects
9,Coventry,Rob Zombie takes his grisly show on the road!,9,9 February 2006,"The last thing you could possibly say about Rob Zombie is that his horror visions are limited and/or that he too easily exploits the remotely successful premise of his directorial debut. Hell no, the successor of the nasty ""House of 1.000 Corpses"" is an entirely different, but certainly no less shocking type of horror cinema that also obviously received a better welcome from acclaimed critics and a wider group of fans. And righteously so, because ""The Devil's Rejects"" is the first film in a long number of years that has the guts to genuinely shock, offend and provoke its viewers without bothering about the possible consequences of its controversy. Clearly influenced by the carefree and uncensored days of the glorious 70's, Rob Zombie serves his exploitation dish unscrupulously and with an almost unhealthy sense of morbid humor. Proceeding where ""House"" left off, ""The Devil's Rejects"" revolves mainly on the three most charismatic members of the Firefly family, namely Otis, Baby and Captain Spaulding. After a brusque raid on their house by the Texan police, led by the relentless Sheriff Wydell, they're the only ones that manage to escape and the rest of the movie follows their bloody road trip across the state. Wydell's interest in the Fireflies is personal, since his own brother was one of the family's victims, and thus his investigation methods are truly unorthodox. Disturbing highlights of the story include Otis and Baby brutally terrorizing a group of traveling country singers and Captain Spaulding petrifying a little boy with his vicious clown looks. There are many other and equally memorable moments, almost impossible to list them all, and particularly the climax is a masterful piece of grindhouse cinema. What I personally appreciated most in Zombie's film-making still is his almost natural aversion to political correctness and his seemly endless knowledge of & dedication for the horror genre. However, he already disposed of these talents when he made ""House of 1.000 Corpses"" in 2003, but now his actual directing skills have also remarkably improved! As a fan you have to be able to admit that, despite featuring many great ideas and gimmicks, Zombie's first film was often too chaotic and incoherent. He clearly wanted to bring a flawless homage to classic titles like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but the results were rather lackluster and overly hectic. In ""The Devil's Rejects"", Zombie's approach and tribute to the classic days of horror are subtler and much better handled. The editing as well as the occasional flashes of slightly irrelevant footage are also much more stylish now and our director's choice not to use his own loud metal music was a wise decision. Instead, he opted for a brilliant soundtrack including songs by Lynyrd Skynyrd and The Allman Brothers Band. The actual storyline is exclusively undercut to show images or brief flashbacks of the victims before their fatal encounter with the Fireflies, which really increases the horrific atmosphere and the viewers' involvement. The violence and disturbing images are omnipresent and a strong stomach is definitely required in order to sit through some of the sequences that are explicitly illustrated. The acting performances are also pretty amazing! Sid Haig's nauseating clown appearance has yet to find an equal and he clearly has the time of his life portraying the fatherly figure of evil. Cult favorite Bill Moseley also looks genuinely menacing and he can cheerfully drivel great lines such as: ""I am the Deviland I'm here to do the Devil's work"" His casting of the supportive characters states further evidence that Rob Zombie definitely is a great horror fan himself. There are modest but nonetheless powerful roles for Ken Foree (""Dawn of the Dead""), Michael Berryman (""The Hills Have Eyes""), Danny Trejo (""From Dusk Till Dawn"") and P.J. Soles (""Halloween""). Leslie Easterhook replaces the legendary Karen Black who originally played Mother Firefly but she does a terrific job. Surely worth mentioning as well is Matthew McGrory who sadly passed away after the release of this film.",The Devil's Rejects
10,michaelRokeefe,"The family that slays together...well, slays together.",8,23 November 2005,"Jump back or strap yourself down. This is gore deluxe and I love it. THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is a sequel to Rob Zombie's HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES(2003). Not so campy; instead grisly, nasty depravity. Sheriff Wydell(William Forsythe)and a band of armed officers ambush the homestead of a redneck family of psycho serial killers. Mother Firefly(Leslie Easterbrook)is taken alive, while Otis(Bill Moseley)and little sister Baby(Sheri Moon Zombie)escape annihilation and join up with partner in crime, Captain Spaulding(Sid Haig), a local celebrity television clown. The body count rises as they humiliate, torture and relentlessly kill anyone that gets in their way. The trio seeks shelter in a whore house in the Fun Town hideaway. Sheriff Wydell, wanting to avenge his brother's death by the Firefly family, makes the decision to over step his authority and cross that line separating law and lawlessness. The finale is high-octane with one of the most ruthless and violent showdowns you've probably ever seen. Writer, director, creator Zombie can be proud of his naturalistic, sadistic and intense kill-fest.THE DEVIL'S REJECTS features one of the most prolific uses of the 'F'word. Strong sexual content comes with the blatantly obvious 'R' rating. Supporting cast features: Priscilla Barnes, Danny Trejo, Michael Berryman, Ken Foree and Geoffrey Lewis. An outstanding choice of southern rock provides musical backdrop and some songs will never mean the same again. You'll hear The Allman Brother's Band, Elvin Bishop, Steely Dan, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Joe Walsh and even Three Dog Night and David Essex.",The Devil's Rejects

You have here a bunch of heavies who destroy each other in the most brutal way. You wonder many time at which moment the torturers will be killed, and when it comes, you wonder this time when those poor victims will be avenged. So this is a topic with killings within killings, involving two batches of psychopaths. I love that. Not for sissies.",The Devil's Rejects
12,Scarecrow-88,The Devil's Rejects,7,23 April 2009,"A trio of sadistic psychopaths escape from the law, retreating to the hooker ranch of a relative pimp, as a determined, hostile sheriff(..out to avenge his slain cop brother, a victim of theirs)is out to find them, with wicked plans to make the group suffer in store. Rob Zombie's mosaic of 70's Grindhouse amidst a western motif, features a gallery of unpleasant characters, committing horrendous acts towards innocent people. It's simple..if you do not have the willingness to operate on the same level as the evil hoodlums you are pursuing, then you're dead. The Firefly clan have no moral constraints or are they bound by the laws of appropriate decency..they love terrorizing the weak-willed and positively embrace wickedness of all types. Obviously modeled somewhat after the Manson family, The Firefly clan thumb their nose at conventional behavior, in favor of raising as much hell as humanly possible. Kidnapping, sexual molestation, mind games, torture, and murder..the Firefly family have no qualms in harming and brutalizing those with the misfortune of entering their orbit. Zombie produces an adversary in Sheriff Sheriff John Quincy Wydell(..played with intensity and ferocity by William Forsythe, in perhaps his finest role to date)who goes beyond the law in order to apprehend and inflict his own brand of justice against these fiends. It's clear that Zombie wants to produce a subtext in this war..is Wydell any different than those he's hunting? I think this film really goes into a dark place despite the black humor, where we watch a man, hired by his citizens to uphold the law, progressively going mad, believing he is God's ""arm of vengeance"", willing to hire vicious bounty hunters(..portrayed by pro-wrestler Diamond Dallas Page and Danny Trejo, who call themselves the ""Unholy Two"", I call them the ""White Trash Duo"")to find them for him.You know, Zombie doesn't let either the Firfly Trio or Wydell off the hook. We witness Otis and Baby(Bill Moseley & Sheri Moon Zombie)hold a traveling blue-grass group hostage at gun point, slowly terrorizing them in various ways before disposing of them. So Rob exposes in detail their willingness to hurt others, absolutely enjoying their handiwork. This film has Captain Spaulding(Sid Haig) in on the action this time, as the three gather at the western whorehouse town of his ""brother from another mother"", Charlie Altamont(Ken Foree). Zombie's style of the film has lots of action shot from several perspectives and the camera-work is never still..the film is always moving, with Rob insisting on a documentary kind of feel(..He even hired a documentary cinematographer, Phil Pharmet of HARLIN COUNTY USA fame)placing the viewer right into the center of the action as the tale of the criminals and their hunter unfolds. Those that decide to commit crime pay a hefty price, even if Zombie's film likes to paint a heroic picture of the Firefly clan, unabashed serial killers lovingly cruel, doing so for kicks and giggles. They even get to go out to the beautiful ballad of FREEBIRD..very much outlaws going out on their own terms, not Wydell's. But, just like we watched Otis and Baby prey upon the family of Banjo and Sullivan, Wydell gets his chance to make them suffer as well. Neither brutal attack is fun to watch, both, at times, explicit in violence, performed with relish and damaging intent. I remember having a hard time sitting through the attack on Roy Sullivan(Geoffrey Lewis), his wife Gloria(Priscilla Barnes), Adam Banjo(Lew Temple), his wife Wendy(Kate Norby)and their roadie, Jimmy(Brian Posehn) with Otis and Baby often deriding them waving their guns around, ordering them around, using threats as an advantage, controlling their every move thanks to possessing weapons. I must say that Norby and Barnes are real troopers for allowing such awful things to take place to their characters, willing to subject themselves to offensive acts committed by Otis towards them. There are times, such as when the camera shoots from the ground into Otis' face as he prepares to crush Roy's skull with a large stick, that he looks exactly like a young Charles Manson..makes the scene even more powerful and creepy, particularly when he proclaims he's the Devil, doing the Devil's work. Actually, Zombie shows less violence than you realize, effectively using sound effects as the camera moves around the acts themselves(..such as when Wydell uses a stapler one Otis and Baby, puncturing pictures of victims to their chests or when he jabs Spaudling with a cattle prod). There are some effective uses of the camera capturing poor Wendy attempting to escape one time, another running around, completely insane seeking help, wearing her husband's facial ""skin mask"" that echoes THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE(..Marlyn Burns running in terror as Leatherface follows with his chainsaw), finding herself in the middle of the road as a semi hits her head on. Superb soundtrack impressively accompanies the movie, adding a little extra to Zombie's intentions of presenting us a realistic 70's atmosphere. His influences, like in his first film, are present for us to see..Zombie doesn't hide from the fact that certain kinds of directors' works inspired him and that is ever present in THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. Hiliarious scene where Wydell is enraged by a Groucho Marx-loving movie critic who makes derogatory remarks about The King..and the ""chicken f#cking"" scene where a furious Michael Berryman(..as Charlie's employee)gets all tore up about a poultry farmer's insults towards his possibly humping a chicken, due to his ""sexually frustrated looks."" The cast seem to be enjoying themselves, but the subject matter can be quite grueling and disturbing at times, especially if the viewer(s)isn't in the right state of mind.",The Devil's Rejects
13,Hey_Sweden,"""I am the Devil, and I am here to do the Devil's work.""",8,24 March 2012,"There's no denying it: as a follow-up to his debut, ""House of 1000 Corpses"", writer / director Rob Zombie's daring and powerful ""The Devil's Rejects"" is certainly not for everybody. But for those ready and willing to take a walk into some dark and depraved places, it serves up an impressive amount of sick and sordid visceral entertainment. For one thing, it very much blurs the lines between ""good"" and ""evil"" here, with our merry band of psychopaths - Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), and Otis (Bill Moseley) being both protagonists and antagonists at the same time. As the cops launch an assault on the Firefly compound from the first film, Otis and Baby manage to escape, while Mama (Leslie Easterbrook, taking over the role from Karen Black) is captured. Hot on their trail is determined sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe), who's not afraid to resort to the same sort of methods that the Firefly family themselves employ. The movie gets undeniably grim and ugly at times, yet one can't look away - it's gripping every step of the way, and really gets the audience involved. As before, Zombie's dialogue is liberally sprinkled with profanity but does contain some absolute gems, especially ""Boy, the next words that come out of your mouth better be some *beep*ing brilliant Mark Twain *beep*, because it's definitely getting chiseled on your tombstone."" Zombie knows how to keep the mood light when the script calls for it, as one witnesses the hilariously silly conversation about carnal relations with chickens. And he, cast & crew also craft some highly memorable set pieces such as the whole incident at the hotel, wherein the Fireflies terrorize a singing clan including such familiar faces as Priscilla Barnes ('Three's Company') and Geoffrey Lewis (an old pro recognizable for his work with Clint Eastwood). In fact, Zombie just packs the cast with pop culture figures and great character players - the fantastic Ken Foree (""Dawn of the Dead"" '78), Easterbrook (best known as Callahan in the ""Police Academy"" series), singer / voice over artist / actress E.G. Daily, Deborah Van Valkenburgh (""The Warriors""), Michael Berryman (""The Hills Have Eyes"" '77), Danny Trejo (""Machete""), wrestler Diamond Dallas Page, comedian Brian Posehn, Tom Towles (""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""), reprising his role from ""Corpses"", P.J. Soles (""Halloween"" '78, ""Rock 'n' Roll High School""), porn actress Ginger Lynn Allen, Mary Woronov (""Death Race 2000"", ""The House of the Devil""), and Daniel Roebuck (""River's Edge""), with an uncredited bit by Steve Railsback of 'Helter Skelter' fame. This movie is gory, lively, and largely dispenses with the more ""fun"" feeling of ""Corpses"", playing things quite straight and taking the time to flesh out its characters a bit more. In fact, the movie is truly more character oriented than its predecessor. It takes its audience on a different sort of ride, one that some movie lovers might not want to experience but which others can heartily embrace. It's appreciated that it actually takes place in the 70's; while ultimately it's a little too slick and modern to have a true throwback feel, Zombie's love for old school exploitation is remarkable, right down to his rather eclectic soundtrack that makes great use of The Allman Brothers Band's ""Midnight Rider"" and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"". ""Corpses"" showed that its novice director had potential, and this film bears out that idea, as he takes his characters and concept in a more mature direction. Eight out of 10.",The Devil's Rejects
14,preppy-3,Sick but not really scary,7,30 July 2005,"Sequel to ""House of 1000 Corpses"". This starts with the house being raided by the police. Some of the family members are killed and Mother Firefly (Karen Black in the original--Leslie Easterbrook here) is jailed--but Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sheri Moon) escape. They hit the road with Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) to torture and kill more people. A sheriff (William Forsythe) is hot on their trail and will do anything to stop them.I thought ""House of..."" was a fantastic horror film. It scared me silly and had me cringing in my seat. This one didn't scare me really...but it made me sick. The merry band of psychos torture a bunch of innocent people. That's OK--that was to be expected. But there is a fine line between horror and exploitation and director Rob Zombie unfortunately keeps crossing it. There is a truly revolting sequence in which Priscilla Barnes is sexually humiliated and brutalized. It was very sick...but not scary. I got the uncomfortable feeling that Zombie was enjoying rubbing our face in this. I can sit through a lot but this went too far. I almost walked out! Also when it wasn't sick it was actually kind of dull. There was no real plot and the attempts at comedy were unbelievably unfunny (the Marx Brothers fan was particularly stupid). It only worked at the end. The last section of the film was very violent and bloody but SCARY too! That worked beautifully. It almost saved the film...almost. Also the film contains non stop swearing--the ""f"" word was used all the time. It didn't bother me but it might bother others.The acting, unfortunately, was very good making this hard to shake off. Moseley and Moon were downright terrifying--they played the roles in a matter of fact way making it seem that they found their acts perfectly normal. Haig was great too--not scary but fun. Easterbrook was also very good as the mother--a very good replacement for Karen Black. Barnes also deserves a lot of credit for doing the torture sequence--she's much too realistic. And it was great to see P.J. Soles (remember her from ""Halloween""?) in a small role.I'm giving this a 7 because it is unapologetically violent (I'm SICK of these PG-13 horror films), has good acting and a scary ending...but it's a big letdown from ""House..."". Let's hope Zombie does better the next time around.",The Devil's Rejects
15,poolandrews,Didn't do much for me.,5,29 June 2007,"The Devil's Rejects is set during 1978 in Ruggsville, Texas where Sheriff John Quincey Wydell (William Forsythe) & his men have tracked the notorious Firefly family down to their farm, in a fierce gunfight one member of the family is killed, mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is captured while Oatis (Bill Moseley) & Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon) manage to escape through a drain. The hunt is on for them as the police find mass graves, dead bodies, furniture made from human bones & a catalogue of other horrors at the Firefly farmhouse. Oatis & Baby meet up with Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) who all then seek shelter at Charlie Altamont's (Ken Foree) whore house, however the case becomes personal for Wydell when he discovers his brother George (Tom Towles) was one of the Firefly's victims & he decides to dish out his own kind of justice once he finds them...Written, produced & directed by Rob Zombie this sequel to his unimpressive House of a 1000 Corpses (2003) isn't that much of an improvement but is slightly better. The nasty & somewhat depressing script takes itself very seriously & is like a twisted road movie as the Firefly clan try to avoid the authorities, at almost two hours in length I thought The Devil's Rejects went on for too long & I must admit I was pretty bored of it by the end. One reason why I don't like this film much is the Firefly's themselves, I hated each & every one of them with a passion & I just wanted to see them all dead. They aren't your usual anti-hero serial killing scum like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger who you actually grow to like & root for, no these are unlikable, annoying, ugly idiots who seem to think swearing every other word makes them hard or something. There is so much profanity in The Devil's Rejects it becomes boring very quickly, it's also pretty hardcore swearing with insults & derogatory terms flying all over the place. I'm no prude & I believe it's impossible to portray certain real life situations without coarse language but this film just contains a constant barrage of explicit bad language & insults for the hell of it. I thought it was a watchable film but nothing special, the exploitation levels aren't that great & unless bad language is your thing it becomes tiresome to sit through. It moves along at a reasonable pace but I never really got into the story & it's utterly predictable too.Director Zombie does OK, he films using the old Blair Witch shaky camera thing, it's not quite as shaky as in the Blair Witch but I don't think there's a single steady shot in the entire film which gives it a certain gritty documentary feel about it. It has a reasonable style & some nice scenes along with a mean spirited atmosphere. The gore & exploitation levels weren't great although there are two versions available, the 'R' rated cut & the obligatory 'Unrated' version & to be perfectly honest I have no idea which one I saw. There are various gunshot wounds, beatings, someone is stabbed in the chest, someone has large nails hammered through his hands (they still manage to drive a car latter in the film as well), someone is run over by a truck & a guys sliced off face skin is placed over his wife's face in a scene that was obviously ripped-off from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). This wasn't as gory or as graphic as I thought it might be although the mental torture & humiliation suffered by he Firefly's victims can sometimes make uncomfortable viewing. There is a fair amount of nudity as well as some sex scenes.With a supposed budget of about $7,000,000 The Devil's Rejects is certainly well made with good production values, it's just a shame I didn't like the film that much because it looks pretty good & nails that 70's sinister sleazy backwoods feel. The acting is good from all involved & it's a pretty damned good cast as well, I've just realised that I have met in person Ken Foree, Michael Berryman & Bill Moseley!The Devil's Rejects is an OK horror exploitation film that didn't really do much for me although it has a certain brutality & mean streak that I liked. Better than House of 1000 Corpses but that ain't saying much, it could have been better although it could have been worse.",The Devil's Rejects
16,dbborroughs,Masterful road/revenge movie is an unpleasant decent into hell for those who think they can take it,10,28 July 2005,"Brutal Ugly Unpleasant and in its way a masterpiece, though I don't know if I can recommend it. I don't know if I like it. I don't know what I think other than it feels like I've been punched in the face.Picking up after the events of House of 1000 Corpses (which you need not have seen,but it might help), a sheriff arrives at the home of the Firefly clan and decides to take no prisoners. Thus begins a gunfight in which two of the Fireflys, Baby and her brother Otis, escape. Mama Firefly is taken prisoner. Baby calls Captain Spaulding as the police are making the connection of his involvement and he heads off to for a meeting. From there things rapidly descend into ugliness as the fugitives run roughshod over everything in their path in mad dash to get away. Meanwhile the vengeful sheriff proves that there are psychos on both sides of the law. Blood is soon flowing.Less horror picture than road movie, this is a brutal thriller with a very off kilter sense of humor. The laughs don't always work, but the violence, often just off the edge of the screen, keeps you sitting either bolt upright or curled up daring not to look. Bad things happen to people and no one is left unscathed. Its simply a ride across the desert of hell with some very unpleasant people (acting kudos all around).This is throw back to the 1970's schlock movies that played in drive-ins across the American South for years. Rob Zombie's working knowledge of the genre has allowed him to fashion what could be described as Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Natural Born Killers if it wasn't for the fact its a unique creation all its own. Zombie has a wicked sense that makes things very realistic and very other worldly. His use of music is a nice counterpoint to what we're seeing on screen. I admire Zombie's ability to use ""old"" forms and to turn them into something thats both old and new while at the same time its completely new. Not to put a fine point on it Rob Zombie is simply one of the best directors working today.If you were to compare this to the work of Quentin Tarantino you would find it vastly superior since Zombie is a able to reform old material into something fresh. Tarantino's talent is simply cribbing whole shots and sequences from other films in fan boy ""homage"" and cobbling them into a film that he dares you not to think is ""way cool"" simply because he says so and because he's seen more movies than you (so odds are you'll never know what he ripped off). Zombie's films can never be said to be anything other than what they are, even though they feel like other films they are gloriously unique.This film is a punch in the face. Its very hard to watch. You really don't like anyone, and in a weird way only root for the ""rejects"" simply because they are the least bad people on the screen. They are least bad because they are the only one's not pretending to be someone they are not (ie. The ""good cop"" or the ""famous"" country singer).And while I think there is much to admire in it (and there is a great deal), its not perfect. Some of the humor doesn't work, one or two things come off as overly mean or the wrong sort of mean. Its worst offense, though, is a ""deus ex machina"" twist used to get things out of ""painted corner"" so the film can head off towards the ending (Its something that might work if you've seen the first film though even then its out of place with the rest of this film.)I don't know what I feel like after this. Actually I feel like taking a shower. This is a bleak masterpiece that is a unique viewing experience. Try it but be prepared for 100 minutes of unpleasantness.",The Devil's Rejects
17,Bunuel1976,"THE DEVIL'S REJECTS (Rob Zombie, 2005) ***",7,17 June 2006,"Rob Zombie's follow-up to his entertaining directorial effort, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES (2003; see comments above) is that rare thing nowadays: a sequel which improves on the original in practically every way. The five members of the crazed family reprise their roles with the exception of Karen Black (who is replaced here by Leslie Easterbrook) and, by this time, they had grown nicely into their roles, especially Sheri Moon (here billed as Sheri Moon Zombie) who almost steals the film with her seductive performance from under the nose of her more experienced collaborators. I say almost because the film's acting honors actually belong to William Forsythe who is excellent as the vengeful sheriff (brother to one of the police officers murdered in the first film) hunting the family members down and, in a truly audience pleasing segment, almost succeeding in decimating them. However, before the film goes all DEATH WISH (1974) on us, Zombie delivers a nice twist which saves the murderous brood for a bullet-riddled final shoot-out with the police which would have made Sam Peckinpah proud. Actually, come to think of it, the film also opens with a similar shoot-out which obviously brings the comparisons with Peckinpah's magnum opus, THE WILD BUNCH (1969), even more to the fore.Even more than its predecessor, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is blessed by a literate and witty script which sends the film towards black comedy territory. The gore is there for all to see, of course, and the squashing of a fleeing victim by a truck is particularly nauseating. Interestingly, the victims this time around are not teenagers but rather a middle-aged rockabilly band (led by a sprightly Geoffrey Lewis) who at least try to resist their assailants. Zombie has delivered a livelier film all round peopled with past Horror/Cult film participants: not just Sid Haig, star of Jack Hill's SPIDER BABY (1964) but also Ken Foree (DAWN OF THE DEAD [1978]), Michael Berryman (THE HILLS HAVE EYES [1977]), P. J. Soles (HALLOWEEN [1978]), etc. I loved the sequence where Forsythe, stumbling upon the fact that the family are using aliases of characters played by Groucho Marx in his films, invites a movie nut to give him the lowdown, whereupon the latter engages in a tirade against Elvis Presley for stealing Groucho's limelight (much as Chaplin would steal Howard Hawks' four months later) by dying a mere three days earlier! Naturally, the macho sheriff won't tolerate a single derogatory word being uttered against The King...Talking about music, thankfully Zombie shows taste even in his musical selections and the film has a killer soundtrack featuring The Allman Brothers Band, Terry Reid, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Three Dog Night and Joe Walsh.P.S. Clearly, Joe Karlosi's **** rating of this one was no fluke...although, naturally, while I liked the film a lot, I'm more modest (although Joe would probably see that as conservative) in my score!",The Devil's Rejects

They hole up in a motel where they, unsurprisingly, find some innocent people to torture and kill. Good times. Anyway, Devil's Rejects is a much more polished film than its predecessor and quite a bit more entertaining, mostly due to its dark humor. Unlike the first film, Zombie actually took the time to flesh out a story here. Granted, it's not a great story but at least it's a step in the right direction to showing he has talent as a filmmaker. As with House of 1,000 Corpses, once again the vicious killers are the characters the audience is supposed to be rooting for.

Seems like Rob Zombie has found this time a better balance between its style and story. The movie flows better and its storytelling works out more effective. Perhaps it also helps that the movie this time doesn't focus on a couple of teenagers. Central this time are simply the bad guys, who were already the most entertaining characters of the first movie.The movie also tries to play less homage to the horror genre and its more a movie on its own but still not without its fun and entertaining approach.The movie is also less about the 'supernatural'. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" had some monster like creatures in it but this movie picks a more 'realistic' approach, which always works out better for its suspense and predictability. It's also obviously the reason why the Dr. Satan scenes were cut from this movie. Basically this movie remains mostly unpredictable, since it features such unpredictable characters in it. It's more down to Earth, which also makes it easier to watch and more accessible for the mainstream public. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was more of a cult-movie, while this movie also clearly had other intentions. You don't have to be worried about it though that this movie doesn't feature Rob Zombie's trademark style, there is plenty of that left.The movie feels less messy and more consistent this time and even though its not as stylish as ""House of 1000 Corpses"" it still is a better movie to watch.

Great opening sequence with a shootout where one arrest is made. From there we witness the torture of a travelling band at the hands of the remaining killers at a roadside hotel. Rob Zombie is a skilled director especially when factoring that this is actually quite different from the previous film. Excellent performances by a cast headed by Sig Haig as Captain Spaulding who leads the family into their grisly lifestyle. The violence is maddening but its anti-hero theme is familiar. Moseley plays his psychotic son Otis, and Sheri Moon Zombie as his daughter. William Forsythe brings in the vengeful madness of the Sheriff whose brother was a cop murdered in the first film. Forsythe reverses the formula when he enact revenge while his subjects are nailed to chairs and questions are asked where answers are a must. Sheri Moon Zombie in particular is given brutal treatment when Forsythe releases her and hunts her down. Ken Foree plays an associate of the Firefly family who is a shyster at best until his intentions go in different directions.

23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Overrated but still watchable,8,13 November 2021,"Following a police raid on their house, the Firefly family is divided as some are captured while others manage to escape and take to the roads as a means of getting back at the police officers who captured their family while still carrying out a ruthless rampage on anyone they come across.This here does have a few good things about it. One of the biggest improvements over the first one is that the film really amps up the grindhouse feel and atmosphere from the original. That comes through quite readily here with the family's actions coming across far more vile and cruel than before which is shown quite readily throughout their treatment of the random people they come across along the way, from the whorehouse to the robbery of the car from the family. Also quite nice was that there was one sequence that is quite inventive and torturous. Holding a family hostage, one of them bursts into the room where the face of one of the family members as a mask. Strapping it to their face, they leave it on them, who later runs out of the room screaming hysterically until a kill from a sudden, unexpected source in the film's one true jump shock. It's quite cruel and creative, all for the sheer amount of joy they have with the concept of it, and for the fact that it's done in a sadistic, downbeat tone makes the scene stand out quite nicely. The other really shocking part is that this kind of enjoyable grindhouse setup allows for this one to dole out a lot more blood and gore. The opening shootout is one of the greatest ways to open a film, with tons of gunfire and a lot of smashed up furniture from bullets causing a great mood right from the get-go while the aftermath of their rampage at the motel or the sheriff's torture methods provides much more throughout here. With tons of gunshots, a slit throat, innumerable amounts of bloody beatings, and some stabbing as well as a scene where a character has nails thrust into their hands, the fact that it's still a pretty bloody film before getting to the amount of damage taken that doesn't result in fatalities also bringing in some gore as well. When it really wanted it, it was quite entertaining. As good as it could've been, there are still some things in here that need to be brought up. The most obvious and glaring problem in this one is the extremely annoying and aggravating camera movements used in this one. The camera shakes around wildly and uncontrollably during most of the scenes, often at tilted angles to begin with, rendering it nearly impossible to figure out what is going on in the scene. The fact that this goes on during the film's money shots is quite a big let-down, as it's for all the chasing and torture scenes that this happens during the big moments is a huge distraction. The on-screen tortures are pretty brutal and clever, but the fact that they're all distorted with the wild and obnoxious camera movements that it's impossible to get a sense of what's happening, rendering all the torturing mute when you can't see it happening. Another big headache is the way that the film occasionally uses slow-motion during non-sequitur scenes. Every now and then, for no reason, the film would slow down and just feature the scene going on in slow-motion without anything playing in the background. It's a nice stylish choice, but it doesn't serve any real purpose to the film for it to be so. It doesn't help us understand the film anymore, and it's a really weird and confusing move. The slow pace really drags this out as well. So much time is spent with the family doing random things that aren't that important in moving the plot along, as an argument over getting ice cream or a stop-off at a chicken farm being the prime factors for this. It really could've been trimmed significantly and cut down, as this is a good fifteen minutes too long. Beyond these, though, this wasn't that bad of a film.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, a couple of sex scenes, and drug use.",The Devil's Rejects

While many will strongly disagree, I think Zombie has evolved the horror films in a strange way.While the foundations of his narrative are still rather simplistic, his visions are stark are visceral, and his characterisations are insane. Every character in his film has some sort of strange trait that on any normal day would appear odd, but for his narrative,suit the film perfectly.A sequel of sorts to House of a 1000 Corpses, the film is very reminiscent of Cravens 'Last House on the left', as behind its very macabre, surreal visage, is a hazy, almost psychedelic feel to it, with a little bit of steampunk thrown in for good measure.The cast are wonderful, he film has an unsettling mood throughout, which is always present in Zombie films, and just when you think things couldn't get any more twisted, they do..In Zombies world, no one is innocent, every character has a dark side, and the Firefly family are there to bring it out that bit more.Not for everyone, but it's a remarkable experience.",The Devil's Rejects
25,The_Void,Devilish grindhouse nastiness from Rob Zombie!,9,8 August 2005,"After his successful fusion of 70's exploitation and pumping rock music for his debut feature 'House of 1000 Corpses', monster rocker turned director Rob Zombie has decided to put on a different tone for the sequel. Gone is the hardcore horror of the first, and in it's place, Zombie has installed a road movie grindhouse style; and once again, he's done modern horror fans proud! It's amazing just how much like a 70's flick this film is, and it's obvious that the director, and the entire cast, had a really great time making this film. In House of 1000 Corpses, it was clear that a first time director was on board, due to the amount of trickery and the way that every scene was populated to the max with fine details. Zombie is much restrained with this picture; and while he still dishes up lots of eye candy, this time round it never feels like he'd doing it for the sake of it. He's also opted not to use his own music in the film. While I liked the songs that Zombie made for House of 1000 Corpses, I much prefer the 70's soundtrack that he's given the movie this time - and with such songs as Joe Walsh's ""Rocky Mountain Way"" and Lynard Skynard's ""Free Bird"" on there, how could anyone not? The plot follows on from the original film with a shoot out on the deranged family's home. This sequence gives you a good idea of what you're in for with the film, as Zombie overwhelms his audience with an uncountable number of gunshots - after seeing this intro, you know that you're not in for an 'easy' viewing! We then follow the two survivors of the massacre, Otis and Baby, who meet up with their father; Captain Spaulding and the three then go on a wayward killing spree across the country. Hot on their tails is vigilante copper Sheriff Wydell, who isn't going to let the death of his brother go without punishment! The Devil's Rejects is really all about it's characters, and the central three - Otis, Baby and Captain Spaulding - could be in any film and it would be interesting. All three characters light up the screen every second they're on it, and it's great to see these guys enjoying themselves. The duo of Sid Haig (Spider Baby) and Bill Moseley (TCM 2, Army of Darkness) return as Spaulding and Otis, while Zombie's wife; the very sexy Sherri Moon, once again steps into the role of 'Baby'. Zombie has also recruited a host of horror movie stars to populate his film with, including Danny Trejo (From Dusk Till Dawn), Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes).Despite the fact that none of the actors are 'A' list stars, they all do amazingly well in their roles. The acting is wholly realistic, and it feels like you're watching real people as opposed to actors at times. The violence in the movie is relentless and hardcore, which is sure to please everyone that wants to see it. There's far too many dumbed down horror movies of late; but this certainly isn't one of them! This film is also very funny, and even though a lot of the action is nasty and deprived - it's very easy to see humour in it. Zombie fuses this hilarity with extreme violence and, exactly what Zombie's stance on actual violence is, is never really clear. He just presents the atrocities and it's hard not to enjoy it. In that way, Zombie makes voyeurs out of his audience and, the fact that Zombie spends a lot of the movie building up his characters ensures that, despite their evils, we care for them towards the end. Speaking of the ending...what an ending! Lynard Skynard's ""Free Bird"" works brilliantly with the action that goes with it, and it's definitely one of the best endings I've seen in recent years. On the whole; this film is not for everyone, but if you like your violence thick and fast - you're in for a treat indeed!",The Devil's Rejects
26,zetes,"Wait to rent, for sure",6,26 July 2005,"This looked like it might be a genuinely good exploitation/horror flick. It almost is. It's a pretty horrific serial-killer-on-the-lam story, but it's undermined by weak performances from a couple of the main characters, a ripped-from-the-classic-rock-station song score, and some very incompetent direction by Zombie. This is said to be an improvement for him after House of 1000 Corpses, which I didn't see (because everyone warned me not to), and to which The Devil's Rejects is a sequel. If it is an improvement, House of 1000 Corpses must be really slovenly. Exploitation fans will be pleased (or disgusted or made to squirm in a good way) by much of the movie. It often works as rednecksploitation. The one thing that always works is Sid Haig as the Marx Brothers-named Captain Spaulding, one of the freakiest looking clowns (""clown"" meant literally) ever. Bill Moseley plays his psychotic son, but, while his look is pretty frightening, he sounds like a dork whenever he talks (he's not even threatening when he's slaughtering his victims). The weakest link in the film is Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie. Her performance is pathetic. She's never convincing as a psychopath, in a performance completely ripped-off from Juliette Lewis' enormously disturbing Mallory Knox from Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (an infinitely better and more intelligent film). And I've never seen such shameless exploitation of a spouse by a director. Note to Rob Zombie: your wife has a nice butt, but she's not even that hot. You could find a dozen women who look like Sheri Moon Zombie at any bar, and would probably easily be able to pick one of them up long before last call. The penultimate sequence, where the cop who's been chasing them through the whole film (played by William Forsythe) tortures the murderers, is actually very good. He ends up giving the murderous family their just deserts. You can almost see that the three have finally felt the kind of evil that they are so accustomed to inflicting on others. Unfortunately, the film ends with a Butch Cassidy-esquire sequence that's just embarrassing.",The Devil's Rejects
27,HumanoidOfFlesh,A brutal and sleazy piece of entertainment.,9,29 October 2005,"Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"" is heavily influenced by such horror classics like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"",""The Hills Have Eyes"",""Last House on the Left"" or ""I Spit on Your Grave"".Still this is is a sadistic and politically incorrect piece of horror that will make fans of grindhouse exploitation smile with joy.The plot follows a Texas clan called the Devil's Rejects who kidnap,torture,rape and viciously kill people.The family is tracked by an obsessed policeman named Wydell whose brother was one of their victims.Sheriff Wydell finally captures and tortures the Devil's Rejects for revenge.So homicidal brother-sister duo-Otis Driftwood(Bill Moseley)and blond Baby Firefly(Sheri Moon Zombie,Rob Zombie's wife)-is back for more bloody mayhem,as well as Mother Firefly(albeit played by a new actress,this time by Leslie Easterbrook)and of course Captain Spaulding(Sid Haig).""The Devil's Rejects"" is a surprisingly mean horror flick that manages to be both horrifying and amusing.This filthy little movie looks like it came straight from 70's.The cinematography is grainy and the use of old Southern rock on soundtrack is a nice touch.The film is also populated by several cult genre actors including Ken Foree,Michael Berryman,Mary Woronov,Danny Trejo,Geoffrey Lewis,P.J. Soles,Priscilla Barnes and Ginger Lynn Allen.""The Devil's Rejects"" is notable for it's unflinching brutality,foul language and general aura of nastiness.The scene where Priscilla Barnes is sexually violated with a pistol by Otis is especially memorable.Give it a look only if you enjoy watching grindhouse exploitation flick-fans of cute PG-13 horror will be offended.9 out of 10.",The Devil's Rejects

Its extremely dark, brutal & gruesome. But for those who enjoy violent films, 'The Devil Rejects' does deliver enough moments to earn itself a viewing. The characters are evil, their journey is unforgiving, but Rob Zombie's execution is well-done & appealing. Performance-Wise: Sid Haig, Bill Moseley & Sheri Moon Zombie are repulsive, but effective.

29,StevePulaski,The devil deserves better,8,7 October 2012,"Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects is a vile, sick, distasteful, unabashedly disgusting motion picture, yet that's what it sets itself up to be. So how do I put this delicately? It's a vile, sick, distasteful, unabashedly disgusting motion picture that I thoroughly enjoy and would recommend to people. But not just to anyone; to those who I know could handle it.The story takes place in 1978, and opens with Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe) and an army of policemen seconds away from performing a shootout on the Firefly home, a family of three which is believed to have been responsible for over seventy-five homicides. The three are Otis P. Driftwood (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sherri Moon Zombie, director Rob Zombie's wife), and Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) (all, except Baby, named after famous Groucho Marx characters from several of his films).The three escape the home with no damage and continue to ride freely throughout the country attempting to escape police custody, yet Sheriff Wydell isn't far behind them. It isn't long before Otis and Baby take a few motel-dwellers hostage and begin to have them commit to illicit, devilishly inhuman activities against their good moral judgment.It would appear I'd condemn a film like this as ""sickening, depraved, or one of my favorite words, deplorable."" I truly wasn't prepared to. Rob Zombie knows how to employ decency within trash, depth behind destruction, and even humanity behind the inhumane. His three leads are all developed and raw and their motivations clear and justified. It's a film that seems to have a greater purpose than to shock but to allow its viewer to observe the amoral nature of these three backwards characters.For once, it would appear that we have a film, trying to pay homage to the dirty, gritty exploitation films of the seventies (maybe we can dub this ""hicksploitation"" or ""southspolitation"" and add to the long line of ""sploitations"" in this world) we usually are given a plethora of dehumanizing qualities all backed up by the phrase ""that's how it's supposed to be."" Zombie's technique is to recreate the gritty seventies vibe, but also reinvigorate it with more zest and depth than many of us are used to and that's where he succeeds; by going the extra mile in his writing and craft.The Devil's Rejects is apparently the sequel to Zombie's 2003 effort, House of 1000 Corpses a film I admired but can't quite say I enjoyed. It had the same sort of style as this picture, but it wasn't all about the ugly characters and disturbing videography as it was about shock. So I remember it.Back to this film; aesthetically, the dirty south cinematography is humid and lively, almost like a character in itself. The music only compliments it, with one of the best uses of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"" since Forrest Gump and arguably the best use of Joe Walsh's ""Rocky Mountain Way"" in cinematic history. If it wasn't already clear to us, Zombie knows the ins and outs of this genre and wants nothing more for his audience than to embrace his cinematic braveness.I'll stress it again that The Devil's Rejects is a film that is violent, depraved, disgusting, and gritty for the sake of being gritty. It surpasses 2005's Wolf Creek for most violent horror film of the year. However, through the bloody, grimy interior bleeds an uncanny amount of style, beautiful cinematography, excellent music, devoted character acting, a truly remarkable performance by Sid Haig, and a helluva lot of fun. It's honestly remarkable how this film merited an R rating and not an NC-17. Brace yourselves, people.Starring: Bill Moseley, Sherri Moon Zombie, Sid Haig, and Williams Forsythe. Directed by: Rob Zombie.",The Devil's Rejects
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"This is only for Rob and House of 1000 corpses fans, I'm serious!",10,23 July 2005,"OK, I'm not a big Rob Zombie fan, but I do like some of his songs: Living Dead Girl and Superbeast. Even though I am a huge fan of pop music, there is a very soft spot on my heart for heavy metal and rock -n- roll music.As most of you know, if you have viewed my comments, I am a huge horror movie fan. I enjoyed House of 1000 Courpses; it had a Texas Chainsaw massacre feel and went back to the classic horror movie clique's that most horror fans truly enjoy. ""The Devil's Rejects"" is by far more violent and scary. Like the commercial said ""They kill without reason"". That's right! The family's back and they're more homicidal than ever! House of 1000 Courpses was a little edited you can tell by Rob's standards, I think he had more freedom with this movie. It is incredibly violent and in no way should be shown to children. I couldn't believe actually that it was only rated R. But I did for some sick reason enjoy it. I'm not sure why, maybe because I was just in a good mood for a gory flick.In this film, Baby and Otis completely torture this family, and I MEAN torture. Sexually, violently, mentally, your body just aches for what happens to them. But I'm not giving spoilers away. Captain Spawlding is back and he's a lot meaner than the first film. They finish off over dozen victims with a great ending playing a terrific song by the late great Lenord Skynord, ""Free Bird"". ""And this bird you cannot change"". It's true when it comes to this family. I would recommend this for Rob or House... fans. Otherwise, it's a pretty twisted movie that you might loose your stomach too.8/10",The Devil's Rejects

32,bensonmum2,"""What's the matter, kid? Don't ya like clowns?""",9,23 July 2005,"-These days, it takes something that I think is going to be really special to get me to go to the theater. From everything I had heard and read, The Devil's Rejects seemed like that kind of movie. Plus, I'm one of those who loved Rob Zombie's first movie, House of 1000 Corpses. So I went in with high expectations. Usually when you do this, you come away disappointed. Not only was The Devil's Rejects everything I had hoped it would be, it far exceeded even my lofty expectations. It's a balls-to-the-wall, butt-kicking, good time.Everything about the movie was spot on. Zombie put everything in the movie that I wanted. It's gritty, brutal, sadistic, and one helluva fun ride. Sid Haig, Bill Mosely, and Sheri Moon ARE their characters. It was easy for me to forget that I was watching actors. And Sid simply steals every scene in which he appears. It's not to say that Mosely and Moon aren't good, but next to Sid it's tough to compete. The characters have gone through some changes since House of 1000 Corpses. If it's possible, they have a darker edge to them.I could literally write pages on everything that worked for me in the film. I could discuss the excellent supporting cast or the choice of music or some of the great set pieces or the sick, violent action or Zombie's growth as a director, but I'll just mention one of my favorite moments - the ending. Without giving too much away, the final face-off between our favorite serial killers and the police is one of the coolest moments ever put on film. I was immediately reminded of movies like The Wild Bunch and its nihilistic ending. It's a film moment that I'll never forget.I, for one, can't wait to see what Rob Zombie does next.",The Devil's Rejects

34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A truly nasty, disturbing and shocking movie, but all the more entertaining for it",9,23 January 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Once again, it seems my extremes have swooped up and down, from watching a pleasant movie like Ring of Bright Water this afternoon, through to this, probably one of the sickest, most twisted and unpleasant films I've ever seen. From both a graphic and subliminal point of view it's a bit of a wonder how it got a rating actually. From the off-set the title lets you know what kind of film it's going to be. And it doesn't disappoint.The plot basically has a tense stand-off involving a Louisianan sheriff (William Forsythe) and his deputies outside a run-down, ram-shackle home where a clan of murderers dubbed 'the devil's rejects' are staking out. Following a tense stand-off and the death of a few officers, one is killed and the mother is captured. But the daughter and son continue to roam free, dodging the long arm of the law whilst also getting the chance to carry out their depraved, deadly activities on some more poor, unsuspecting victims along with the help of a twisted, ogre-some clown called Captain Spaulding.Weirdly, it's only when the end of the film draws near that you realize just what a nasty, unpleasant experience it's all been. I was left with a feeling similar to that of other recent films I've seen along the lines of Running Scared and the Kill Bill movies, only it didn't feel as though the excessiveness of the unpleasantness was being piled on so heavily that it became a laugh like with those films. But this goes a bit deeper than that, and it's nasty side is enjoyed so much that blood and gore isn't all it pumps on, we also have to endure some very disturbing, upsetting, even distressing scenes of human degradation, humiliation, callousness and the twisting of the loving nature of the female species that it's a struggle to think who'd find it enjoyable. But this all serves to make it an even more satisfying revenge film in the end, if you approach it with the right mind set.It is a nasty, blood-soaked film, a non-stop bombardment of fu*ked up unpleasantness with no real artistic value but plenty of blood and gore and a satisfying end denouement. I imagine it's predecessor House of 1000 Corpses was even more so. ****",The Devil's Rejects

There are no good guys here. The sheriff is just as bad as the killers he is pursuing. It's about what one would expect from a director named Zombie. There is some offbeat humor but for the most part the film wallows in violence, glorifying it. Haig is one scary looking dude. Moseley looks like Charles Manson. Moon, who is Mrs. Zombie off-screen, is lovely to look at but is as sadistic as any of her male companions. The film qualifies as something of a guilty pleasure.

38,Fella_shibby,I wantd the sheriff to shoot all of 'em rather than blah blah,9,31 July 2016,"I first saw this on a DVD in 2006. This was way better than its predecessor House of 1000 Corpes. It was sleazy, gruesome, and actually funny at times. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding r the outlaws pursued by William Forsythe (The rock, Once upon a time in America) aka Sheriff Wydell as he is hellbent on revenge. While the first one was in one area n one house mostly, the 2nd one is more outside n on the go. This can b termed as a road/revenge/western movie. Now coming to the clichés usually found in most horror flicks. 1)Characters outnumbering a villain who is only armed with a knife, and yet not making any effort to attack the villain. 2)Waiting forever to steal a gun from the villains, then waiting forever to shoot the villain. 3)Villain is down on the ground but not attacking n giving the villain plenty of time and opportunity to get up n attack. 4)N of course the gun is not loaded. 5)Talking a lot before attacking the villain n losing the opportunity. 6)Crying n running helter-shelter n running straight into the arms of a member not realizing that he is part of the gang. Most of the same star cast r continued in this flick. A new addtion is Ken Foree (Dawn of the dead-both new n ol) n the above mentioned sheriff.",The Devil's Rejects
39,insomniac_rod,There are no conventional heroes anymore...,8,2 December 2006,"Where have all the good heroes gone? The ones that are good behaved and fight against crime. It seems that there isn't room for good guys anymore. Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"" is a perfect example of how modern anti-heroes are the ones that new generations root for. If this wasn't rated R I am sure it would become an instant classic for a younger audience. It has badass characters with a negative attitude, ""cool"" lines, and memorable death scenes. Rob Zombie, a fan himself, created a Horror movie for fans. You will find yourself identified with some scenes because Rob Zombie knows perfectly how to connect with the audience. This sequel has nothing to do with ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" ; while the original looked like a surreal acid trip, the sequel is more of a raw, crude, and violent exploitation movie with an 70's feeling. Forget about Dr. Satan, the non sense flashback sequences, and the colorful settings. The cinematography and art direction of ""The Devil's Rejects"" is dark, and as I said, very 70'S. Also, the black humor is present but in another manner. If you can handle making fun of violence, this movie will have you very entertained. The gore is beautiful. The minimal use of CGI is well justified and Zombie created one of the most memorable scenes in modern Horror: the final car shooting massacre with Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Free Bird"" playing in the background. The movie gets your attention since the explosive opening sequence when the local police opens fire again the Firefly's house. Excellent action sequence mixed with Horror. Then the movie follows a raw, violent direction and delights us with memorable displays of violence. Very brave for a mainstream Horror movie. After the dirty scene involving two couples getting killed in the Kahiki Motel; our favorite trio hides in Charlie's house of whores. Then, Sheriff Wydell hires two horrible mercenaries (one of them, the GREAT Danny Trejo) in order to get the Firefly family. The movie in my opinion has an ending and a sub-ending. First, when Wydell tortures the family in a light manner, and then the now infamous ""Free Bird"" massacre. I was totally satisfied after the ending. My problem with this movie is that Zombie created his own clichès and displayed them through all the movie. I mean, he gives a noticeable, ""cool"" personality to his characters but at some points it gets annoying. I understand that Otis is probably the most badass guy in the world but it isn't necessary to demonstrate it with pseudo-badass lines. But it isn't only with dialogs that Zombie demonstrates that his characters are ""evil"" and grotesque; he also displays their violent personality through some scenes. For example, Ottis standing near to his victim and saying ""I am the Devil and I am here to to the Devil's work"". The scene is memorable because it's very obvious that it is intended to show that Ottis is a badass. The same goes for Sheriff Wydell when he loses his mind when the geeky movie critic says something about Elvis. I understand that it's for character development's sake but still, I think it's exaggerated. At some points, Capt. Spaulding, Ottis, and Baby look like a trio of loonies who act violently in a funny, black humorist manner. Still, I really liked the John Quincy Wydell character. He is a more aggressive version of Dennis Hopper's Lt. Lefty Enright of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". He' has the lord by his side and also knows how to use a shotgun. Capt. Spaulding is also a likable character. Probably the best in the movie. The acting couldn't be better. Favorite Horror actor Bill Moseley delivers a wicked but clichèd performance. It worked. Sheri Moon is a really bad actress but she looks tormented and that helps her gray performance. She is truly hot but that isn't enough. Sid Haig is by far the best actor in this movie because he truly knows how to portray a sicko and at the same time, a clown with a terrible attitude. William Forsythe also gives a great performance. He stole the show in my opinion. I dug his performance and his acting overall. Great character! The rest of the cast is just okay. Including veteran favorite Ken Foree and the amazing Prsicila Barnes who delivers a brave performance. I recommend ""The Devil's Rejects"" for those who want to get more involved in the exploitation genre; specially from the 70's. This is a good homage to 70's exploitation and at some points looks very adapted to the new century. Also if you are into extreme violence you might enjoy this one although it's not as violent as extreme movies.Kudos for Zombie who once again gives us the fans, a brave Horror movie that hadn't to deal that much with the MPAA. He cares about us the fans, and that's something to recognize. You will root for the bad guys, that's for sure...",The Devil's Rejects
40,Anonymous_Maxine,"Revenge is a dish best served cold, messy, fast, loud, and at great length.",6,9 June 2006,"Having been hugely impressed with House of 1000 Corpses, I was eager to see Rob Zombie's next directorial effort, but found that it fell short in a lot of areas. Midway through the film, for example, it roughly turns into an almost senseless mishmash of Texas Chainsaw elements, losing sight of the return to true horror that Zombie presented in his last film. I think that as I get older I have lost a lot of my taste for some of the things you see in horror movies, although it remains one of my favorite genres. I remember when I was in high school I thought the Faces of Death movies were the coolest things imaginable, and that anyone who could get their hands on the elusive Faces of Death part 1 achieved an almost God-like status, as did the first person who discovered the Traces of Death films, which were supposed to be even better. Today, you would have to put a gun to my head to get me to watch even a single scene out of any one of those movies.The horror genre as a whole, however, remains a lot of fun to me, because the movies are generally more fun than disturbing. But I think that when a movie or series of movies becomes sort of a contest to see who can come up with the sickest, most torturous and disturbing things that they can possibly put on screen, then the whole point is missed. I don't know, maybe I've just moved to a different wavelength.At any rate, The Devil's Rejects are your standard Texas Chainsaw family that lives on a farm covered with dozens and dozens of the mutilated bodies of missing persons from the area, and William Forsythe plays the detective with a special link to the case, who ultimately decides to take matters into his own hands when he finds the restrictions of police procedure to be too much to bear. I am reminded at times of the horrendously sick and disappointing Wolf Creek, but I will leave it at that. I have far too much respect for Rob Zombie as both a musician and a filmmaker to tie even any part of his film to such pure, authentic waste as the recently released Hostel from Eli Roth, easily one of the five worst films I have ever seen in my entire life. And not in a funny way, either, like Robot Monster. After I saw Hostel, I honestly wished for the end of Eli Roth's career, whatever effect that should have on the rest of his life. This is a man that simply should not be allowed to make movies.There is a point at the end of The Devil's Rejects where the movie could have gone in a different direction and done something completely different and probably bigger than it did, but its representation of futility and fate, while not exactly fresh, are at least somewhat satisfying. Although I have to say that I am much more excited about Zombie's soon to be upcoming contribution to the Halloween series than I am about this movie. I reckon this will become a footnote in his growing career. The movie gets hard to watch as the victims are punished and tortured, but William Forsythe offsets that for a while by giving them exactly what they deserve. There is a decidedly unexpected twist when the wildcard is once again introduced into the movie near the end, and I have to say that I'm glad that Zombie didn't just cop out and leave the ending open for a sequel. It's hard to watch at some points, but if you are a fan of any of Rob Zombie's work, I imagine there is something here that should entertain you",The Devil's Rejects

How will they deal with the sheriff who has a mean streak and a grudge to match? Is this movie even better than House of 1,000 Corpses? You'll have to check it for yourselves!Rob Zombie improves highly over his first effort. He continues his homage to the seventies cinema with the slasher/revenge genre as well as southern horror. The cast is filled with many under used and talented ""B-Movie"" actors. As the film progresses we learn a lot about Baby, Otis and Captain Spaulding. A side that they wish they could live but can't.

47,MBunge,Gah. Just...gah.,3,2 September 2010,"This movie is like an 8 year old who has learned the F-word. It can be sort of amusing at first, but pretty soon you just want to smack him until he shuts up.The story opens up with Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) leading a police assault on the run down, rural Texas home of a family of degenerate mass murderers. Even though the family had apparently heard of Ned Kelly, the police manage to kill one grown son and capture the matriarch, Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook). Another grown son and daughter, Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sherri Moon Zombie), manage to escape and contact the patriarch of the killer clan, Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig). While Otis and Baby take a band of musicians hostage, Captain Spaulding goes off to arrange a refuge for the family at what appears to be an Old West brothel still operating in the late 1970s. Sheriff Wydell becomes more and more obsessed with stopping and killing the group now called by the media ""The Devil's Rejects"", and recruits a couple of biker thugs called The Unholy Two (Diamond Dallas Paige and Danny Trejo) to assist him.The first thing to know about this film is that it's only purpose is to shock. There are graphic stabbings and shootings and beatings and molestations of one sort or another. A woman is forced to wear a mask made out of her husband's face. 4 inch long spikes are driven through a man's hands. That sort of thing. There really isn't any point to all the pornographic violence, other than the base arousal all pornography is geared toward.The second thing to know about this film is that it isn't at all shocking. Oh sure, if you've got a weak stomach you'll find it horrifying and repellent. But if you've got a weak stomach, what are you doing watching a film like The Devil's Rejects in the first place? Even though this movie wallows in atrocity on a visceral level, none of it means anything because none of it has any connection at all to any sort of reality and it also serves no narrative purpose as fiction. There is no point or moral to give this story significance and there is never a moment when it seems like the things that happen in this film are really happening or that the people in this film are really people. Baby and Otis and Captain Spaulding are all crazy and evil, but only in cinematically attractive ways. Their victims, even when the script tries to give them some personality, are never anything more than props. As Baby and Otis escape at the start of the movie, they run through the basement where we see many young women caged up, obviously waiting to become future victims. But while they scream and grab at them through their cages as Baby and Otis flee and while the police should have rescued all of those women, none of them are seen, mentioned or referred to again in the film. Their sole reason for existing in this story is that Rob Zombie thought it would make a really cool-looking scene. That's largely the only reason for anything that exists in this story.In addition to not being shocking, The Devil's Rejects isn't scary either. Zombie is either incapable as a director of generating honest fear or he's so concerned with trying to disgust his audience that he never bothers to try.This movie is also a graphic demonstration in just how horrible it can be to be an actor. The Devil's Rejects starts out with a scene where a young woman is tied up and dragged naked over the grass covered ground. The woman is dead, so the actress doesn't get a line of dialog or even a moment to try and show emotion. She's just a piece of exposed meat that's meant to titillate those who can be titillated by a naked dead girl. How pathetically desperate for money or fame do you have to be to take that kind of part? Much like the 8 year old who just learned the F-word, Zombie doesn't understand or appreciate what he's doing in this movie. I'd guess that he has never really had any truly bad thing happen in his life. If he had, he could have taken that memory of pain and put it to use in this film, giving it some recognizable adult, human depth. As it is, The Devil's Rejects is nothing more than Rob Zombie saying ""Look at me! I treat these horrible murderers like the heroes of the story and make the good guys just as insane and brutal as the family of killers! Aren't I so naughty?"" A lot of us go through that phase when we are teenagers. It's embarrassing that Rob Zombie hasn't outgrown it.",The Devil's Rejects
48,sauravjoshi85,Not everyone' Cup of tea,7,17 March 2019,"This movie is unique in it's own way. Lots of violence, guns, ill words but still it has it's own beauty. There are some flaws but overall I enjoyed the movie.",The Devil's Rejects
49,lukem-52760,WILLIAM FORSYTHE IS THE BEST PART OF THIS FILM,5,29 June 2019,"Rob zombie has made a some very good films, the Halloween & Halloween 2 remakes but this & it's first film,House of a 1000 corpses are pretty sick & too twisted, don't get me wrong these are very well made films with excellent performances especially from Cult Hero Sid Haig but there's too much of everything & it's characters are real sickos.
""1000 corpses"" was too silly,over the top & went too far to enjoy at all & Devil's Rejects was too ridiculous in it's attempt to make us feel for the evil serial killers!!!
Now William Forsythe is excellent here & gives a fantastic performance.They are demented & pure Evil & when the Awesome vigilante sheriff gets them & starts torturing them i was so excited as they all deserve to die brutally for all the savage evil they have done to their victims,but it's made to look like the sheriff is sick & twisted for wanting to hurt these monsters?
So the whole movie is trying to make us connect & feel for these sadistic freaks, there's still some Awesome scenes as well as disturbing scenes & i enjoyed Danny Trejo on screen.
I would rather have had the sheriff on a mission hunting the killers down like Charles Bronson did in his trashy violent old school Thriller's & killing off a few but hey atleast he's a main character & a great one throughout this gritty & violent as hell 70's style dusty grindhouse flick.
A solid sinister slasher & it did star one of my favourite actors ever, the cult action B-movie star Danny Trejo,that was the best part of this film & a great performance from William Forsythe as the vigilante Sheriff but he was made to be the badguy? It's too grim often too when the depraved villains are looked at as our heroes!!! I wanted them to all be killed by the Sheriff but No!!!
With all the sadistic death & destruction there has to be some sort of Justice but here ""Zombie"" loves his evil killers & aimed his movie as they're story from a serial killers point of view & that's clever but a bit too grim & gross & that really well done intense Sheriff scene was so good & he should have had his revenge on atleast one of them.
Well we know how it all ends here & that scene is very well done but it's hard to like such depraved characters.All in all Rob Zombie is a good Horror director & has an Awesome gritty vision & style but it's morally hard to really get into a film about the evil in our world that's made to look like heroes, but that being said it's entertaining in a twisted way lol & we have some great roles for old school veteran Horror actors.
Danny Trejo has a nice little role but the best character & performance goes to William Forsythe as the vigilante Sheriff ""Wydell"".""Devil's Rejects"" is a dusty, sadistic & extremely depraved serial killer slasher with some great bits & some too sick bits!!!",The Devil's Rejects
50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Glorious, grungy masterpiece",10,21 November 2015,"Rob Zombie's grind house exploitation extravaganza The Devil's Rejects is as grungy, gruesome and nauseating as horror gets. It's also carefully, skillfully written, impressively designed and populated by characters that attract our morbid fascination despite their repulsive natures. He took his same Firefly Family from his debut feature House Of 1000 Corpses, yanked them out of their eclectic, psychedelic horror setting and tossed them into the dusty highways and hick towns of the southwest, setting them loose for a road trip odyssey of profane, ultra violent mass murder and often darkly (and I mean really darkly) funny mayhem. He also makes them a bit more human, as opposed to the cartoonish versions they were before. They bicker, interact and fight just as any regular person would, they just happen to be lunatic serial killers, and Zombie's poetic cesspool of a script reflects that brilliantly. We begin with a bang, as Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe) leads a raid on their backwoods murder shack, bullets flying, a frantic, frenetically awesome sequence. Only two escape; spunky, psycho Harley Quinn-esque Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie) and volatile, terrifying Otis Driftwood (Bill Moseley). Mama Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook, taking over for a deceased Karen Black) is captured by Wydell. Baby and Otis set out on the run, meeting up with their father, demented clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), and trying to stay one step ahead of the law while murdering as many innocent people as they can. There's an extended sequence at a motel where the family terrorizes a family that is the closest it gets to the straight up horror of the first film, and is an agonizing, vomit inducing scene to watch. A lot of the style and set pieces are more like a western than anything else, and I admire Zombie's creativity for sort of switching up genres to see where he could go with it. It's almost as if the characters from a horror flick wandered into western-ville just toH shake things up. A testament to Zombie's skills in creating character (in his other films too which are all solid) is the fact that despite the sheer vileness and unapologetic, disgustingly psychotic nature of these characters, we still find ourselves wanting to hang out with them for the duration of the movie, laughing at their jokes, and dare I say it, relating to them in one way or another. That's writing and direction. Praise must be given to the performances as well. It's really tough to do the scenes that the actors are put through here (I know from experience) whether on the predator or prey side of the coin, and every performer here is amazing. Sheri Moon has a nasty streak that stings, a bubbly cutesy pie bundle of lunatic energy. Moseley turns Otis into a raving monster that would make Manson shake in his boots, giving his scenes a constant clammy tension and fuelling suspense with his wild, unpredictable nature. Haig is a hoot and a holler as Captain Spaulding, and you'll find yourself laughing at stuff he does that you just know you shouldn't find funny, but his pitch black perfect performance just makes it so. Forsythe is a revelation as Wydell. He's an actor whose energy and commitment have always drawn me in, and he's a force of brutal, corrupted nature as a man of the law whose lost his way and succumbed to the evil he is trying to vanquish. Such a badass. Zombie has a knack for delving into the cinematic nooks and crannys of yesteryear and pulling out all kinds of awesome actors that may not have been seen for a while, or that we haven't remembered are still around. Here there an incredible sideshow of supporting talent, including Danny Trejo, EG Daily, Geoffrey Lewis, Rosario Dawson, MC Gainey, Dallas Page, Ken Foree, Michael Berryman, Brian Posehn, Lew Temple, PJ Soles, Tom Towles, Matthew Mcgrory, Mary Woronov, Daniel Roebuck, Duane Whitaker and Steve Railsback. There's also some beautiful classic bluegrass and country tunes as well, from Allman Brother's Midnight Rider to Lynrd Skynrd's Free Bird, payed in its entirety over an epilogue that can only be described as epic. Now fair warning: this film is not for everyone. It's as down and dirty as movies get, and a good fair bit of it is in very bad taste indeed. But as anyone who's familiar with the sub genre will tell you, that's the point. Casual viewers on the other hand, might just crapped the bed and flip out at the rampant nihilism, relentless brutal violence, human cruelty and layer of filthy, profane scum that the movie lives in. For me, that's the fun of it.",The Devil's Rejects
51,drownnnsoda,"Different Sequel, But Unexpectedly Great.",9,27 May 2006,"While I enjoyed the 2003 horror flick ""House of 1000 Corpses"", I found that enjoyed ""The Devil's Rejects"" more. But you have to judge them separately, they're much different from each other. ""The Devil's Rejects"" picks up where the last film left off, and we have Otis, Captain Spaulding, and Baby, who are on the run from the police after their corpse-laden farmhouse is taken over by the police. As they run from place to place in a desert area, they leave a trail of blood behind them, taking advantage of and killing helpless victims all along the way. While this is happening, a local sheriff, hell-bent on avenging his brother's murder, is tracking the gang down, following their long trail of blood. But could I really enjoyed ""The Devil's Rejects"", but you can't compare it to ""House of 1000 Corpses"", because they're way different movies, hardly close at all. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was like a carnival freak-show, with some zombies, Satanism, and other weird things thrown into it. It was a little far-fetched, but still good, you just kind of had to buy into the whole thing and go for the ride. While on the other hand, ""The Devil's Rejects"" is a much harsher horror film that is a lot more realistic, it's just bad people doing bad things to other people. The Satanism mumbo-jumbo and bizarre freak show elements are thrown out here, and I think that is why this film exceeded the original. These elements made the original harder to believe, so ""House"" was much more unrealistic. Zombie took the story of the Firefly trio in a different direction with this film, and it was nice to watch the Otis, Captain Spaulding, and Baby interact with each other, as we see things from the villains' points of view.And it was even more interesting how at a certain point in the film, they go from being the bad guys to being the victims. I've never seen a movie where characters that are as sadistic and evil as this trio is, actually turn into victims. And the strangest thing about it is that I actually felt bad for them. I felt bad for them! How can one feel bad for these characters after we watch them kill so many innocent people in such sick ways? It's beyond me, but somehow Zombie does it and he does it well, cleverly switching roles of the characters. As for the acting, Sid Haig reprises his role as the scummy but jolly Captain Spaulding, as does Bill Mosely as Otis. Sheri Moon is strong as well as the twisted but attractive Baby Firefly. Karen Black sadly doesn't return for this sequel to play Mother Firefly, and while her presence was missed, the actress who replaced her did a fine job. Cinematography wise, this film looks much different than it's predecessor as well. ""House"" had a certain style reminiscent of '70s B-horror movies, while ""Rejects"" is more gritty and realistic. To sum things up, ""The Devil's Rejects"" is an exceptional recent entry into the horror genre. But it is much, much different from ""House of 1000 Corpses"", so if you're expecting something just like the original film, you may not enjoy it as much. You have to separate the two films to enjoy this one to the fullest, because the style and overall feel is much different, even though this sequel focuses on the same characters. 9/10.",The Devil's Rejects
52,davispittman,Lackluster sequel,4,3 August 2018,"The Devil's Rejects (2005) is a sequel to House of 1000 Corpses (2003). This sequel features the same characters, but with a very different kind of plot. In this film, the sadistic serial killer family is running the show, the victims aren't the stars here, the killers are. The family is on the run throughout the entire film, with the police and a sheriff with his own agenda after them. There are several different reasons as to why I'm not giving this film nearly as high of a rating as it's predecessor. One, is that it's not nearly as creepy. I feel like all the scariness was sucked out but they piled on the sadism and crudeness. In my opinion, that is a big mistake. I liked the first so much because it wasn't just pointless nasty violence, it was actually creepy and had a unique plot. Here, not so much. Two, there wasn't enough interesting details here to keep me engaged. This film felt very run of the mill and lacked the creativity of 1000 Corpses. The writing was also pretty messy, I feel like they just cursed for the sake of cursing. I am no prude and I have no issue with cursing, but when it's literally every two seconds, it comes across as lazy. Overall, this is not a good horror film and it's predecessor is much better. 4/10.",The Devil's Rejects

This documentary is over 2 hours and 20 minutes. Which included interviews with the cast, behind the scenes, how the film went to production and more.This Sequel ends up being one of the best films of 2005. Writer/Director:Zombie came close to make this sequel a Masterpiece. Ends up being one of the most important horror films in years. This Sequel is laced with dark humour, the film ends with an brilliant conclusion and it is also unexpectedly touching. Writer/Director:Zombie did an craftsmanship work with this film and I think, this Sequel would be hard to top his next feature film. Since this is his second feature, He hits the bull's eye.Watch for Mary Woronov (Eating Raoul), P.J. Soles (Halloween), Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter), Daniel Roebuck (River's Egde) and Robert Trebor (My Demon Lover) in cameos. The late Matthew Mc Grory appears in his minor role as ""Tiny"" from the original. Tom Towles (Herny:Potrait of Serial Killer) appears in a Cameo from the first film in a Important Scene. M.C. Gainey (Breakdown) and Rosario Dawson (25th Hour) appears in Cameos in a Deleted Scene from Disc One, which this scene involved the infamous character Dr. Satan from the original.

54,JoeKarlosi,The Devil's Rejects (2005) ****,10,12 August 2006,"I thought it was excellent - for what it was - which is a brutal, depraved, realistic, sick, twisted, thrill ride of unrelenting terror. It rivals THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE for gritty and stark realism, done in-your-face. This film is trash, and that's precisely what it wants to be and succeeds as. There is nothing pretty here. I don't think this is the type of film that will go down easy for most people, but for those who are able to sometimes place their values at the door and get caught up in the bizarre world of the serial killer(s), this is a masterpiece of its type. Great music throughout, too. One of the ""best"" of the ""psycho family"" genre films ever made.This is the first Rob Zombie film I've seen, and I liked the fact that he (like Tarantino) is obviously a fan of film, and that he takes his influences from older movies - in this case, exploitation flicks of the '60s and '70s. I also appreciated that Zombie uses largely unknown actors (Sid Haig, Ken Foree) instead of Matt Damon or J. Lo. -- His heart is in the right place. It's surreal seeing someone like THREE'S COMPANY'S Priscilla Barnes being terrorized and forced to strip down -- and a bit jarring to see what's now physically become of the brunette from TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT (Deborah Van Valkenburgh). I was also amazed at how much the MPAA allows these days for an 'R' rating"".P.S. --- When I first saw the film I didn't even realize it was a sequel to HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES (which I'd never seen). I then heard a lot of negative things from many of my friends about the first film, so I always stayed away from it ever since enjoying REJECTS. In fact, many people I know seemed determined to pass up REJECTS because they thought CORPSES was so disappointing. I had to assure everyone that, regardless of what they thought of HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS was very good and well worth catching.

Michael Berryman makes a modest appearance as the simpleton sidekick of Ken Foree and William Forsythe almost steals the show as a God-fearing lawman with an axe of vengeance to grind.The violent set pierces are executed with thrust and style and some nasty gun-molesting of a hot woman's giney is a welcome, twisted surprise.An unapologetic hymn to Seventies ""roughies"" and Southern exploitation, the film's photographic grittiness and focus on general nastiness ought to earn some respect in sleazier cinematic circles.Zombie ably demonstrates that he enjoys a good beating, a bloody shooting and a nicely framed derrière.

Here is a retarded vandal film maker who sees 'the fun' in making and exporting a film deliriously humiliating and sexually destructive whilst debasing anything and anyone before beating and mutilating them.

57,aidanratesmovies,"Over the top horror flick may be Zombie's best, but still isn't any good",3,27 July 2021,"Zombie's signature white trash, over the top style takes a new level with upping the ante at just about every moment it can. At times, it can succeed in its ideas and themes, but for the most part, its yet another misfire. What works best is when Zombie differentiates from his usual formula and attempts something new. The film feels like Natural Born Killers if it had a firmer grasp on style than substance, and often has some entertaining moments. The soundtrack is good, and some moments can be quite intense- even difficult to watch- but unfortunately it just feels too saturated to be worth the time. I feel like this film could have easily been like a half an hour shorter, but was dragged out to try and give the film a more feature-like length. For the first half of the film it can be entertaining, but eventually it starts to deteriorate and become quite tedious. The acting is nothing special, but nothing horrible either- far better than House of 1000 Corpses but lacking any true charisma or standouts. The dialogue in the film can feel quite a bit wonky at times, and at other times be quite laughable. The film also takes itself far too seriously, I get the vibe Zombie was going for, but with just a bit more fun involved with the film it would feel like more of an adventure to watch rather than a gruelling chore. In the end, The Devil's Rejects is far from Zombie's worst- in fact it might be his best, but it's hardly enough to compete and compare with so many other better quality horror films out there and is at last something you just might wanna skip.My Rating: 3.1/10.",The Devil's Rejects
58,Jonny_Numb,"""Rejects"" Re-Appraised",7,25 August 2007,"(Second Review.) While a director without the pedigree of a loyal fan base spawned by a successful music career would have seen ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" put his career six feet under, Lionsgate agreed to release ""The Devil's Rejects"" in July of 2005. As with ""Corpses,"" I was among the opening weekend crowd. Why, you ask? Well, I suspected Zombie might have learned something since his debut. And while I concluded that he had improved as a filmmaker, the finished product was a vile, unbalanced train wreck without a moral compass, and written with just as much infantile ""flair"" as ""Corpses."" To make a comparison, I HATED ""Last House on the Left"" when I initially viewed it on video (circa 1997), only to rediscover it years later and love its balls-to-the-wall '70s grunge. Well, now the same change of heart (and possibly person) can be applied to ""The Devil's Rejects,"" possibly the only film out of the current blood-spattered horror explosion to hammer that nail of '70s realism, grit, terror, and fearless (and fearsome) violence into the head of all those who purport to wear the same influence.Zombie wisely tones down the excessive ""psychedelic"" style that made ""Corpses"" such a headache. Save for a few instances, his choices in technique (including properly invasive close-ups, hand-held images, and slow motion) are complementary to the plot (the use of shifting freeze-frames of characters to mark a segue), and sometimes have a surprising effect. There are two scenes near the end of the film that invoke a bizarre sentimentalism that I never would have expected from Rob Zombie.While ""Corpses"" was constantly jerking us out of any possible aura of '70s nostalgia with the inexplicable technical moves, ""Rejects"" is relatively consistent, andmuch to my surprisedoes succeed in invoking that tone. Zombie engages us from the start, and is careful not to lose his grip as the film runs its 111-minute course; like the best offerings of the '70s grindhouse (including ""Last House"" and ""Texas Chainsaw""), he puts us in the moment, and seldom references his influences in a winking way.With ""The Devil's Rejects,"" Zombie creates a truly visceral experience. Once engaged on its bloody journey, I was surprised that I once thought it stilted and artificial. This is the real deallike Gaspar Noe's equally hard-to-stomach ""Irreversible,"" Zombie's endlessly-spinning moral compass eventually reaches a stalematelike its grindhouse kin, ""good"" and ""evil"" is ill-defined, and our reactions to the forces of law and order (represented by William Forsythe's Bible-thumping Sheriff Wydell) and uncontained evil (the renegade Fireflies) yield surprising results. While the ""lesser of two evils"" question comes into play, Zombie cleverly downplays any answerindeed, the film is populated exclusively by characters who are lecherous, reprehensible, murderous, hypocritical, and sexually sadistic, but there are glimpses of ""good"" thatas the film progressesthrow us for a loop. While some may consider this baiting and manipulative (you bet your ass it is), it adds a surprising complexity to the proceedings.The Firefly family has been cranked down a notch, rescued from the exaggerated histrionics of ""Corpses"" and transformed into something that is, as Zombie has stated repeatedly, ""more real"": Otis is no longer the shouting, screaming harbinger of doom; Moon's twittering cackle has been snipped; and Spaulding is a hulking, paternal presence; Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook replacing Karen Black, and well) is a shrieking, tongue-waggling psychotic, but not without love for her even more demented family. That's the tricky thing about Zombie's storytelling herewhile making the movie a moralistic gray area, he has us being shocked and appalled by the actions of the Fireflies, but pulls back to show glimpses of humanity that are even more shocking. We never fully ""side"" with any character in the film, but that doesn't mean the performances are rendered without a certain enigmatic touch. In a sense, the audience is implicated in Zombie's chaosas with ""Last House on the Left,"" ""The Devil's Rejects"" is a boundary-pushing work that looks to unravel the viewer's own feelings toward characters and situations that, in other hands, would be presented in black-and-white terms.Recalling several particularly nasty scenes from my theatrical viewing, I was rolling my eyes at the prospect of yet another ""Unrated"" DVD of a current horror film. There was a time when the ""Unrated"" tag actually pertained to films that were threatened with NC-17s by the ratings board and went out theatrically and on video ""unrated"" to distinguish itself from the cut ""R"" version that would accompany. Today, the ""Unrated DVD"" is an anomaly in our consumer culture, a marketing gimmick designed to sell more units with the notion that you're getting a lot more sex or gore or whatever (indeed, the label implies a forbidden, NC-17 level of whatever). With ""Rejects,"" Zombie inserts some moments that are so jaw-dropping that they would easily merit the dreaded NC-17 in theatrical release (including an almost unbearable extension of the already grueling motel room sequence). Zombie knows shock value well, but imbues ""Rejects"" with shock value invested with a response that is both gut-wrenching and bizarrely emotional. Needless to say, his grasp of character this time out is more controlled and realistic, rendering the violence with battering-ram force.But, like ""Texas Chainsaw,"" ""Rejects"" has other strange bits of commentary nibbling at its scratchy, grainy cornersthe importance of family, the tenuous line separating ""good"" from ""evil,"" and the media reaction to such things. While Zombie seems less interested in satire than endurance-test setpieces (of which there are plenty), this extra fodder is subtly rendered and adds a little extra to an already strong, brutally blunt film.",The Devil's Rejects
59,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great Blend of Road Horror and Exploitation,9,8 October 2020,"This is a movie that I saw in the theater with a couple of friends at the end of high school. If you know my thoughts on House of 1000 Corpses, I was leery to see the follow-up. I ended up loving this movie immediately. I'm pretty sure I had only seen it that one time until now, so it is like 15 years between watches. This would be the first time watching it with a critical eye as well. The reason for the rewatch was to watch all the films from the Summer Challenge Series for the Podcast Under the Stairs of the 2000s. The synopsis here is the murderous; backwoods Firefly family take to the road to escape the vengeful Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe), who is not afraid of being as ruthless as his target.We start this off with crime scene footage as well as text that are getting us up to speed. This is after the events of House of the 1000 Corpses. There is a Sheriff Wydell is hot on their trail and we also learn that this family is dubbed, The Devil's Reject for their depravity and brutality.The movie then shows us Tiny (Matthew McGrory). He's dragging a dead woman when he sees a bunch of cop cars coming up their long driveway. They have the house surrounded and led by Sheriff Wydell. He announces their presence outside while the family inside the house spring up to defensive positions. This is Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) and Rufus (Tyler Mane). A shoot out commences when they don't give up, which results in Rufus dying and Mother Firefly being arrested. Otis and Baby get away. Once free, they call Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) to alert them for the back-up plan. They all hit the road.In the process, they do what they do best to make it to their rendezvous. It is first to a motel where they encounter the Sullivan & Banjo group. This consists of Roy Sullivan (Geoffrey Lewis), his wife Gloria (Priscilla Barnes), Wendy Banjo (Kate Norby), her husband Adam (Lew Temple) and a roadie of Jimmy (Brian Posehn). This group is taken hostage and many of them killed as Otis goes to get guns and Baby watches the room waiting for Captain Spaulding.They're trying to make it to Charlie Altamont's (Ken Foree) whorehouse he runs along with Clevon (Michael Berryman) and a slew of women. The Devil's Rejects journey won't be easy though. Sheriff Wydell won't give up for what happened to his brother, George (Tom Towles), from the previous movie. He is willing to go as savage as they are and he also hires a couple of ex-cons to find them, Rondo (Danny Trejo) and Billy Ray Snapper (Dallas Page). The go by the name, the Unholy Two, and they're the best at what they do. It becomes a race of survival where the lines of good and bad become blurred.That's where I want to leave my recap of the movie as I'm going to assume most people have already seen this one to be honest. This was definitely the movie that I saw and made me become a Rob Zombie fan. Him and his films hold an interesting place for me since I know he can make really good films, but for whatever reason, he really just has fallen off.To really get into this one, we're paying homage to exploitation films here. I'd say that it really does start off like Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which House of 1000 Corpses pays homage there as well. This is really more of a road horror movie though as the Devil's Rejects are fighting for their survival here and it forces them away from their homestead. We really don't get enough movies like this and it is a subgenre I dig.What I like here though is the evolution of our characters. Zombie does a good job in fleshing them out. Captain Spaulding was such a minor character in the first one where this really fleshes him out and I'm so glad they did. Haig does a great job as this dirty clown and has a great line that he delivers to Susan (P.J. Soles) and her son. I like that they took Otis from being this weird, albino character to the badass that he is here. Moseley just embodies this role as well. Then there is Baby and I think Zombie did good in making her less annoying in this one. Sheri Moon Zombie is the weakest of the three, but she fits in well.Now we continue to see how vicious the rejects are. What really makes this movie interesting though is the blurring of the lines with our protagonist of Sheriff Wydell. It is a good touch with the revenge angle of getting them back to what they did to his brother. He gives a speech later in the movie about his ancestors and how they used to delve out vigilante justice when it was the Wild West. This works for me and with how well Forsythe plays it. In the end, we don't know who is really good and who is really bad here since both sides are mirrors. The sheriff would be the lesser of two evils as he's trying to kill criminals, but the lengths he has to go to do so makes him lose any sort of humanity.If I have any issue here, it is again how Zombie writes the dialogue to his characters. I liked for the most part better what he did in House of 1000 Corpses with our group. He has the Sullivans and the Banjos talking pretty vulgar and it just doesn't feel natural. He really seems to want to make a dirty and gritty film, but I think it works better to provide them with innocence. I'm even fine with everyone talking vulgar at Charlie's place as that is fitting. There is also a line of dialogue about chickens that is just cringe as well. What I will say is that I'm glad they didn't include Dr. Satan in this movie. I liked the character, it just won't fit here.I've already delved into this a bit, but if you couldn't tell I really like the acting here. I've gone over the 4 main stars of the movie. Foree is good as this pimp character. Having seen this and the original film, I prefer Easterbrook as Mother Firefly. Lewis, Barnes, Norby and Temple are fine in their performances. My issues there of course are with how their dialogue is written. I love the cameos by the likes of Trejo, Page, Posehn, Elizabeth Daily, Towles, Berryman, Soles, Deborah Van Valkenburgh, Ginger Lynn, Mary Woronov, Daniel Roebuck and Duane Whitaker. I love that Zombie went to get actors and actresses from the past and giving them a role here.Moving this over to the effects of the movie, I didn't realize that Robert Kurtzman did the effects. He's a name that I've seen before and it doesn't surprise me that the effects here were good. They decided to go practical with pretty much everything that I could see. The only thing that didn't was some fire near the end that used green-screen. I can forgive that for how small that is. The cinematography was well done here and it was elected to go more traditional which I like.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. If there is one thing that I can count on, it would be the music selections to be good. I like that Zombie took music from the era. He really likes the syncing up and the dichotomy with songs that are more upbeat or sound happier while we're getting things that are horrific playing out. This is especially seen at the climax of the movie and the ending. The latter is truly iconic with the playing of 'Free Bird' by Lynyrd Skynyrd.Now with that said, this is up there as my favorite film from Rob Zombie. It is by far for me the best in this Firefly trilogy. I really like taking what they did in the first with making this a road horror film that is paying homage to the exploitation films of the 1970s. The duality of our characters that are horrible criminals and them dealing with a sheriff that is blurring the lines of the law. The acting is good across the board. No major issue with any of the effects and the soundtrack really adds an element to this movie. My only real gripe is the dialogue of some of the characters; it just doesn't work for me. Regardless, I rate this as great movie. It just comes up short as being an all time for me.",The Devil's Rejects
60,onepotato2,genuinely crappy,1,6 September 2007,"The problem with The Devils's Rejects ultimately is that Rob Zombie is a timid bourgeoisie who won't let anything truly shocking get in the way of his calculated investment, and his very deliberate image positioning. The movie lacks the courage of it's p.r. because passing the current boundary of violence (established by other braver projects) might cut into profits. He's a pretty unconvincing salesman for it, and a bad actor. If you like being sold things, you'll like the movie, but the violence isn't shocking despite being the films raison d'etre. In a movie like, say... Blood Simple, the violence is shocking because it anchors a non-violent story at various points. In the Devil's Rejects, there is no story, the violence is there to keep numb, unimaginative viewers stimulated. Gee, that's some rebellion. Much of it performed on the sets left over from Big Fish.Yeah, he beat Rodriguez and Tarrantino to the grindhouse revival. So what? All 3 made mediocre movies from it.This is the thick-headed movie the chronic masturbaters of Idiocracy would watch.",The Devil's Rejects
61,RatedVforVinny,My all time most favourite movie!,10,7 December 2019,"I can't remember if Iv'e reviewed this before, as iv'e seen it a countless number of times. A far superior sequel to Rob Zombie's own, 'House of a 1000 Corpses'. This one sees the gruesome Firefly family, flee their homestead and hit the road; with lots of delightful chaos and mayhem along the way. Bill Mosely is the star of the show (as Ottis B.Driftwood), and with a performance that rivals his acting (as 'Mop-Top') in 'Chain Saw 2'. Any movie that has 'Reelin' in the Years' by Steely Dan (in the soundtrack) is going to get a ten from me, as does the rest of the choice score. With Sid Haig at his very best (top funny form) and the most gorgeous Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob's Daughter), I have to say (right now) it's my favourite movie of all time.",The Devil's Rejects
62,RainDogJr,Free Bird,10,24 September 2007,"Rob Zombie's first feature film is was just the beginning of what i think is going to be a great director. This film, his second is more than a horror film , is a complete tribute to the 70s style and to all the horror classics from a true horror fan. Quentin Tarantino says at the Cannes Film Festival about Rio Bravo: the film contains hang out characters that becomes your friends. Whit that phrase i resume The Devil's Rejects. Amazing characters that later became the heroes in the film because is not the cop the real hero, i mean when he is torture them you are waiting for a revenge or something because the main characters are now the heroes in the film.Finally the way this film ends with ""Free Bird"" is one of my favorites ends in the recent years.Great film, the best of Rob Zombie and now i want to see Halloween.",The Devil's Rejects
63,Matt_Layden,"""As Brutal As Hollywood Will Ever Get""",8,10 November 2005,"Rob Zombie gives us a sequel to 'House of 1000 Corpses' set some months later with the Texas State Police making a full-scale attack against the murderous Firefly family residence for the 1,000+ murders and disappearances of the past several years. But three of the family members escape, including Otis, Baby Firefly and Baby's father Captain Spaulding. The evil trio go on a road trip, leaving dozens of mangled bodies in their wake.House of 1,000 Corpses was said to bring back the old golden age of horror. After many visits to the MPAA they movie was pushed back a few years. Then when it finally came out, the hype surrounding it ended up being disappointment. Zombie now with more experience behind the camera and with the pen, gives us a sequel to Corpses which is as brutal as Hollywood will ever get.Where Zombie went wrong with Corpses, he does right in Rejects. No more do we have Dr. Satan, instead we are centred on the core characters of, the insane Otis, the beautiful Baby and the funny man Captain Spaulding. Zombie manages to up the suspense, the story, directing, acting, and of course the gore.Now I'm not saying that this is a masterpiece of cinema, it's far from it. Although, what Rejects does do is make you feel sick and disgusted with what is on the screen. Exactly what Zombie set out to do. Is it the most brutal movie ever? Of course not, but for Hollywood standards it reaches the extreme level. The film itself seems more gritty and violent because of the grainy film that Zombie uses.Zombie uses many different techniques in this film, including freeze framing and in a star wars like cutting, slicing to the next scene. With talent in music videos and his debut film, Zombie is able to better himself here. He knows what to shoot now and what not to shoot. With Rejects, Zombie doesn't have the pressure of trying to impress or re-create the genre that he once said he would, instead he is able to focus on what's important.Rejects has a super-star cast of another kind. No big Hollywood names here, but prominent people in the business nonetheless. From the likes of Diamond Dallas Page and Michael Berryman to the cute E.G.Daily, who does the voice of Tommy of the kids show Rugrats.The use of music fits perfectly in this film. Freebird is the perfect way to end the film, which changes in sync with the film. Th Allman Brothers Midnight Rider flows wonderful with the freeze framing on the opening credits.Upon a first impression, I thought that the psychos went on a murder spree throughout the country, now though this is true, the spree isn't as big as one would imagine. After a brutal hotel encounter, the family hide out at Spauldings brother place, where the cops came at them. After that, it's just torture from the lead cop and a great ending. So murder spree gone, this film still has enough shock moments to keep you interested.Zombie makes a ferocious picture with the aid of a great cast and beautiful music. The film is sadistic and and throat gripping. If you're not a fan of grind house or torture in films, then you might want to skip these carnage. If you're a horror movie fan and love to see the massive slaughter of people, then without a doubt, check out this disturbing little film.",The Devil's Rejects
64,vengeance20,"Better, But Drags...",8,6 June 2019,"Watched this one a few nights ago after watching The House Of 1000 Corpses, which was average for what it was but didn't stand out a great deal, nor did it take advantage of its premise.This film however, does it a whole lot better. The gore is there, the voilence is there & the story seems more engaging & enticing.The story follows a firefly family who after nearly being apprehended in there own home, go on the run as a vengeful police force give chase!But my only issue is the film drags near the end, and becomes too stretched out for a simple story climax.Overall, better than first, but drags too much near the end. 8/10",The Devil's Rejects
65,brando647,This movie completely surprised me...,9,24 January 2006,"After watching this movie, the only thing I can think to say is, ""Wow"". This movie was excellent. I did watch it the first time with low expectations, since ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was fun but nothing special. By the end, I was amazed at how much better this movie was. It seems that in the few years it has been since Rob Zombie directed his first movie, his skills have improved ten-fold. So did those of the main cast.While ""The Devil's Rejects"" only takes place a short while after the events of the first movie, it seems as if the characters are a lot more mature this time around. Otis has gotten even creepier (but that may be because he looks more like the demented redneck-type this time around). Baby spends less time with the too-forced-to-be-creepy laugh and airhead attitude and actually seems more grown-up. And Captain Spaulding...well, there was nothing wrong with Captain Spaulding to begin with.This movie shows great improvement in the directing and editing. One thing I noticed while watching the movie was that, about halfway through, I had begun pushing for the bad guys. Rob Zombie had portrayed the three characters in such a way that there are points where you completely forget what horrific things they had done less than fifteen minutes ago and you start hoping they make it through.One last thing that really added to the feel of the movie was the soundtrack. Unlike ""House of 1000 Corpses"" which consisted mostly of Zombie's own music, this film was full of classic southern rock, with tracks by the Allman Brothers, Joe Walsh, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Somehow it really added to the film's atmosphere.If you've seen ""House of 1000 Corpses"", you have to watch this movie. If you haven't seen ""House of 1000 Corpses"", you have to watch this movie. Trust me.",The Devil's Rejects

While the trio goes on a killing rampage, trying to run away from the police, the police are trying to go after them.I have not seen the first film but this film made sense. I didn't think this even sound like a horror film in the first place. If it was, it's not scary. From what I have heard, this film is disgusting. I don't agree. I've seen films like Saw III grosser than this.I would consider this an action comedy. Yes, comedy. There are some very funny scenes in the film and maybe some disturbing films. As you always get from these movies are dumb people and unreal scenes. If you get hit by a tree branch several times, what would happen? You fall down and black out, but no, not in this film. This person manages to get up and attack right back to the other person.Well, against some clichés and the paragraph explained above, I liked this film. It was very entertaining and you care about the ""bad guys"" because there personalities is great and they have a good reason for killing people. The acting from the cast is good.One thing I really find unnecessary is the constant nudity. I don't get why films like these needs them. I also laugh at the dialog with the constant f-word in almost throughout of the whole film.If you are one who likes horror movies, this film will not scare you.

67,MartianOctocretr5,Wake me up when the cops close in,3,24 March 2007,"A movie that tries a dark comedy ""violence-so-bloody-it's-supposed-to be-funny"" approach. It fails miserably. The acting is forced and plastic, the storyline familiar and worn out, the directing non-existent. It's about a family of low-life freaks who live in the middle of nowhere and kill a lot, and are now on the run from cops who are trying to hunt them down. That's the whole plot.Characters are obviously intended to be overstated, but the cast acts more like a bunch of hyper kids overdosed on sugar than anything else. Apparently, all the writer could think of for anybody to do was argue/yell, have endless sex encounters, and hack a lot of innocent victims into road pizza. Their entire dialog is that tiresome single word vocabulary always used for ""tough"" anti-social characters. It gets dull after a while, as do the constant extreme close-ups of ugly people's nose hairs and rotting teeth. The only good thing about this movie is when the cops close in to exterminate this vermin; to me, they couldn't croak them fast enough, not just for their heinous acts, but also for their abysmal acting.",The Devil's Rejects

Baby Firefly is so evil and the girl who laughs etc. at other's suffering. The dude from JUST SHOOT ME meets his demise early on in the movie. I was shocked to see just how far Rob Zombie goes in his movie making. I guess even when the camera's would stop rolling, the people who worked on the movie would just start crying etc. Especially when Otis put his gun where he shouldn't have on that girl TERRY from Three's Company.

He can just do them better than anyone else. Rob Zombie is the master at disgusting, putrid horror that can make any person from an older generation cringe. This story is very well written, and the things that happen are just fun to watch. The movie drops off pretty often, but once it does, it easily catches itself and gets back up. In a way, it could be a way of Rob Zombie telling the world he just doesn't care what they want, much like his characters.Grimy story about killers on the loose, who take hostages, escape multiple times, and end up dying in the end. No morals really, and no great tellings can come from this movie. But it is damn good!6.5 Stars?",The Devil's Rejects

It is in my top ten films of all time. There was so much to appreciate in the film: The great soundtrack featuring The Allman Brothers Bnad, Terry Reid, Lynyrd Skynyrd etc. The brilliant performances by Sid Haig, William Forsythe, Bill Moseley, Leslie Easterbrook, Geoffrey Lewis and Ken Foree. In a fair world, they would all have won Oscars. There were many other great actors in bit roles too. Great characterization - the unapologetic redneck characters like the unholy two and the two rodeo exhibition couples. There ought to have been separate films about each one of the supporting characters. The hilarious dialogs - the film had some of the best dialogs in recent memory. The great action scene at the end. And even though they are terrible people, you sort of miss the Reject's when the movie ends. Rob, you made the audience spend enough time with the Rejects to make us empathize with them in the end. You sort of wish you had friends like them :). They occupy a free world where everyone lives on impulse, far different from the square life. Best Regards, Pimpin.",The Devil's Rejects

I thought it was a piece of crap and didn't know it was going to make us side with the bad guys. In summer of 2007, I decided to give this a 2nd chance because Rob Zombie was directing a remake to my all-time favorite movie, HALLOWEEN! I like better now than when I first saw it. It starts with Sheriff John Quincy Wydell and his troopers begin a full-scale attack against the Firefly family. Only Otis and Baby make it out. Mother Firefly is caught. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding plan to meet at the Kahiki Palms Hotel. They torture and kill the members of Banjo & Sullivan, then they seek refuge at brothel owned by Captain Spaulding's brother, Charlie Altamont. Wydell turns into a vigilante and hires bounty hunters to find the Fireflys. Wydell threatens Charlie into giving up the Fireflys. Wydell then takes them back to their house and tortures them.

There are many thrilling moments framed in a kaleidoscopic atmosphere but the plot is less inventive here; the approach of the film consists of turning sadistic cruelty and gruesome scenarios into art, that's what Rob Zombie did (a bit better, actually) in the first episode. The viewer is assaulted with repelling scenes along with gore and lot of blood.

73,lambiepie-2,Zombie likes good old rock and good old slasher horror,8,17 March 2007,"In watching ""The Devil's Rejects"" I could not escape the fact that Rob Zombie is a fan of good old rock songs and good old slasher horror movies. This was an homage to both.... and I liked it. Zombie did get it right this time, bravo.Be forewarned, to many of you it is wild and violent, but I've seen films go much farther and much deeper in unnecessary slasher violence - without a rhyme or reason. 'The Devil's Rejects' characters actually had a reason and that was part of the story. The sick, disgusting story of them. Every horror nightmare-fear is addressed here, as well as elements of surprise and visual disgust. You may not like it, but it's there as it was with the genre it pays homage to.Besides the fact that ""everybody and their momma"" from the old school horror genre was a part of this film or were used to inspire characters, made this more interesting to watch. If you're an old school (60's 70's) horror/slasher buff, you'll see every element was used to tell this continuing tale of a warped family of nut-cases.Also, I am a music fan and every film I watch I pay attention to the score and soundtracks that drive it - The Devil's Rejects used some of the best rock songs that aren't too over used to move the story along. Listen carefully.A good film for those who like the old school original slasher/horror-family genres, this is your kinda film.",The Devil's Rejects
74,baumer,Last House in the middle of nowhere,9,4 October 2005,"""I am the devil, and I am here to do the devil's work."" THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is musician-turned director Rob Zombie's follow up to his directorial debut HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSE, which was given a substantial theatrical release but didn't really find it's true audience until it's video launch. Instead of rehashing the same story as House of 1000 Corpses, Zombie was smart enough and ballsy enough to do what so few director's do, especially in the horror genre, and that is to further the story. He has expanded on the story, given the characters more depth and allowed us to get to know them even more than we did in the first. While the first film tipped it's cap to many of the horror icons of the 70's, this one seems to have more of it's own identity. At first glance it feels like a pimped out spaghetti western similar to a gunfight at the O.K. Corral, there is enough original ideas in here to make a second sequel.The sequel's focal point is also the Firefly clan, a Texas family whose favorite pastime is senseless (is there another kind?) murder. In the prior film, one of their victims was a police officer named George Wydell (Tom Towles, 1990's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). In the opening sequence of THE DEVIL'S REJECTS, one of George's relatives, the sheriff (William Forsythe, EXTREME PREJUDICE) is leading a raid on the Firefly's farmhouse. During the raid, all hell breaks loose as one of the family members is murdered, three escape and member of the family is captured, this being mama Firefly. Long-haired sociopath Otis (Bill Moseley, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2), brutal, pathological sex kitten, Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie, TOOLBOX MURDERS), and massive and deformed Tiny (Matthew McGrory, BIG FISH) escape, Tiny escapes into the woods and remains near the farmhouse, but Otis and Baby murder an innocent woman and steal her car, setting out on the road. They're joined on the way by Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig, FOXY BROWN), Baby's father, professional clown, and man responsible for luring innocent victims into the Firefly's web. Together, the three begin a nationwide murder spree while traveling to Charlie's (Ken Foree, DAWN OF THE DEAD) Fun Frontier Town, a place where sex and drugs flow freely for a price and is owned by an old friend of Spaulding's.The strength of Zombie's two films is his eye for detail and his homage to 70's films he seems to love, like many of us do. There is a sometimes documentary style feel to this film as you seem to watching all of this debauchery unfold in front of your eyes. While I enjoyed HOUSE immensely, I have to admit that this one is better. The characters are more polished, the acting is much more cerebral and adding to the panache of the film is William Forsythe. I have to admit that I have been a fan of him since his turn as BUCK ATWATER in WALTER HILL'S EXTREME PREJUDICE. Here, he shines as the revenge obsessed sheriff, who not only wants the FIREFLY'S arrested, he wants them dead. How Zombie lured Forsythe into this role is a great mystery, but it works well.I found it interesting how Zombie has created a film where the line between heroes and villains is blurred to the point where it nearly ceases to exist, with Sheriff Wydell's lust for revenge against the Fireflys being nearly as sadistic and menacing as the family themselves. What I enjoyed was the comeuppance dished out by the maniacal but grieving Forsythe character. He has become just like the criminals he is trying to punish and that is refreshing. Too many times I see the good guys take the high road and refuse to become ""like them"". That doesn't wash with me and to see the retribution here is not only refreshing, but it is realistic.Overall, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS is a hard film to write a review for as I've no wish to spoil its many grisly secrets and horrifying themes. I'll conclude by saying this is a great film for true fans of horror and exploitation films and a massive improvement to HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES. Its not for everyone (even horror fan who prefer THE GRUDGE/BOOGEYMAN-style thrills may be annoyed), but if you're prepared to accept its hardcore, unapologetic demeanor and nasty characters, you're in for hell of a ride.9/10",The Devil's Rejects
75,mstomaso,"Worth Seeing, But Check Out ""House..."" First",6,24 July 2005,"Rob Zombie took the same characters he created for House of a Thousand Corpses and gave us a higher-budget, flashier, and more commercialized murder-shocker - The Devil's Rejects. This is certainly a prettier and more polished film, with better production values, occasionally brilliant camera-work, and better acting (despite having the same principal cast). The same elements of the original are mostly intact - a psychotic serial killing family, vaguely satanic sadism, comedy, torture and a lot of blood. What's missing are the ambiguities, the darkness and the outright psychosis which appear in ""House"". And to compensate the audience for the loss of some of the elements which made ""House"" a good film, Zombie throws in sex - the most over-used plot device in cinematic history. Of course, its not just sex, but sexual violence mixed with torture, blood and nightmares.In other words, where 'house' was a dark, campy, creepy murder flick, ""Rejects"" is a light-drenched, raw, fairly (but not entirely) serious murder flick. No problems with the script, the acting, the concept, or even the plot - but, some definite problems with the entertainment value of the film. This just isn't terribly original and drops the idiosyncrasy of ""House"" for a typical Hollywood approach. Rejects starts out with a police raid on the house of a thousand corpses. Most of the family escape through a tunnel in their basement (why the police were unable to find this tunnel is a mystery). The police nab the mother, who plays up the satanic expectations of the police interrogating her and infuriates the sheriff (well played by William Forsythe) into an obsessive, vengeful state (his brother had been murdered by the family years ago). The Fireflies leave a trail of terror and murder in their wake and Forsythe follows it, until he is able to set his trap. I won't go any further with the plot outline because I do not want to write a spoiler, but I do want to elaborate on Forsythe's intense performance. His rage and self-righteous wrath blur the boundaries between cops and criminals quite effectively as the story progresses. If you want to know what I mean, you'll have to see the film.The Firefly family, through most of the film, consist of Otis a lank tall man with long stringy gray hair, Captain Spaulding, an intimidating evil and merciless clown and Baby, Spaulding's daughter, a cute blond particularly fond of torturing her male victims. The characters are more or less consistent with their portrayals in ""House"", but I have to admit, I think Shari Moon Zombie's Baby was very inconsistent from film to film. In ""House"" she is completely and utterly insane and fearless - using her shrill psychotic laughter especially well. In 'Rejects', she screams a lot, does a lot of running-away, and is actually fairly rational compared with her sadistic, torture-loving murderous kin.Finally, I don't think you can really 'get' this film if you haven't seen 'House'. So if you have any reason to want to see it, see ""House"" first. Some of the behavior of the characters will make little sense to you without their back-story.Bottom line: Weakly recommended for horror fans.",The Devil's Rejects
76,reddiemurf81,A cleansing of the wicked,6,30 July 2021,"The family is back and now the law is hot on their trail. What carnage will they leave in the wake this time.While the first movie was a bit much (imo), this movie has a different overall feel to it.Not quite as many shocking visuals, and a bit more realistic as far as the action goes (running in a mask and getting plowed over by a semi). The new cast members bring a lot to the screen (Easterbrook, Forsythe, Foree, Temple, Lewis) as well.I think this movie and his remake of Halloween are his best movies (also,, they
may be the only 2 worth watching all the
way thru). I'd give this a 6.5 rating.",The Devil's Rejects

Hmm...",The Devil's Rejects
78,ODDBear,Violent and hard hitting,8,2 December 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is a far superior movie than The House of 1000 Corpses in every way. Although House was not a bad movie, it seemed to splice together so many elements from countless genres it was hard to define it and as a whole it didn't quite cut it. Some bits were great while others plain stunk. Rejects however is pure ""road movie"" fun, with a touch of drive-in feel to it and made with a lot more ambition than House.You could link it in some ways to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it's gritty look and atmosphere is similar in many ways but director Zombie combines it with a unique style that's all his. It's filled with artistic touches, such as clever editing, well done mobile camera-work and a terrific use of it's highly original soundtrack. While this too may be indicative of many genres combined, the end result is far more satisfying this time around.The story here, beginning only months after the massacres in House, has our serial killers being hunted down by the local officials at full force. Most of them manage to escape and in the proceedings wreck a lot of havoc but one very determined sheriff will not rest until justice has been served.Here we have the ""wonderful"" main characters from House plus an array of new faces. Haig, Moseley and Moon are all downright creepy and effective in their roles but William Forsyth definitely steels the show here as the no-nonsense sheriff who's out for blood. The script, while being a little too foul mouthed (with every character involved) is well written and has a few surprising twists up it's sleeve. You practically never know what's going to happen next. It's also quite funny at times, some real laugh out loud moments occur. The film is violent, very violent indeed. Zombie's approach to it is very hard hitting, just a plain smashing here is more effective than most over the top kills in slasher flicks. The dreary atmosphere created here gives the film a more realistic look, it kinda' looks like a movie made in the early seventies (I guess that's what they were going for; and they succeeded).The Devil's Rejects may not be for everyone's taste. But for those of us who like this sort of thing (violent, gritty looking, hard hitting and bloody films) this movie is the best of it's sort in a long time.",The Devil's Rejects
79,MrGKB,"Workmanlike, but unordinary",5,26 July 2005,"I'd heard a lot about how great this one was supposed to be, especially in the wake of the director's maiden effort, ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" which I found amusing, but far too cartoonish to be genuinely scary. Well, this one goes more for a realistic feel, but fails equally to be scary, or even very much disturbing. The crude dialogue gets boring very quickly, the acting, direction, and photography are all competent without being stand-out in any significant way, and the ending...well, let's just say that Phase One of the ending is obvious from about a hundred miles away, and Phase Two of it is...well, stupid and overdone. The very thought that these three dirtbags deserve even an iota of glorification is repellent, which is maybe what Mr. Zombie intended, but if that's the case, he has an odd sense of what his audiences want. If I'd had my way, Sheriff Wydell (played to a nice demented pitch by William Forsythe, a tough-guy actor I have always admired) would have agonizingly tortured each of the three scumbucket ""Fireflies"" to within an inch of their lives, forced Capt. Spaulding to kill his worthless son, made Baby kill her father, then raped Baby with something very nasty in each orifice of her body, then killed her in some awesomely gruesome way, and then been bushwhacked by Tiny. Zip, bam, boom, no idiotic ""Freebird"" ending, just the whole desolate house going up in flames with everyone in it. The end.But, it wasn't up to me. Tough luck, maybe in another life.Meanwhile, there were a few neat set pieces: the sequence in which Baby plays with two hostages culminates in a fantastic knife wound, and shortly thereafter we're treated to a highway fatality that will define the term ""roadkill"" for some time. Most everything else is by the book, with a liberal dose of white trash gutter talk. It gets old fast.Mr. Zombie may eventually come up with a genuinely scary movie. So far, all he's done is stitch together various bits of nightmare imagery and redneck boogeymen into semi-coherent story lines. Still, it was fun identifying all the B-movie actors Zombie cast, including a near-unrecognizable Mary Woronov, and the soundtrack (not counting the intolerably long ""Freebird"" sequence) was first-rate.",The Devil's Rejects
80,cultfilmfan,The Devil's Rejects,8,23 July 2005,"The Devil's Rejects, is a follow up film to musician, writer and director Rob Zombie's 2003 film House Of 1000 Corpses. The film takes place in 1978 where Sheriff Wydell, finds the home of the murdering family clan of the first film. There is a big shootout and Otis, and Baby escape. They later catch up with Captain Spaulding, and are on the run from Sheriff Wydell, and along the way they kill people and hide out with the help of family and friends. Sheriff Wydell, is hot on their trail and want to get even with them for all of the victims they have killed including his brother Lieutenant George Wydell (from House Of 1000 Corpses). The Devil's Rejects, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody in the cast (especially by Sid Haig (who plays Captain Spaulding), Bill Moseley (who plays Otis) and Sheri Moon Zombie (who plays Baby)), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design and good makeup effects. House Of 1000 Corpses, was filmed in 2000 and that is when I first saw ads for it and being a big horror movie fan I thought it looked really good and was anxious to see it. The company that was going to release the film was Universal Pictures. When they saw the finished product they thought it was too violent and that it would probably get an NC-17 rating (which most studios are scared to get for fear of not making a lot of money because it restricts people under 17 years of age from seeing the film). Two years later MGM picked up the film and while it was being edited Rob Zombie made a comment about MGM being happy about having a bloody movie and because of this the film was dropped. A year later finally Lions Gate Films had the courage to release the film and did (althought it was very cut however and in some areas you could really tell). I went to see the film and enjoyed it quite a bit. Some critics criticized the film for being too much of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre clone. I wouldn't call the film a clone but rather a film following in it's footsteps making the film look like it was made in the 70's and Rob Zombie pulled that off quite well. Another remark was that the film was too short and there wasn't an awful lot to it. I basically agree with that. There isn't a whole lot to the film and you could tell that it was heavily cut (I once read that almost half an hour was cut out of it) but the film had a very neat visual style, had some interesting characters and was entertaining and in my opinion a good ode to 70's horror movies that Rob Zombie grew up with and loved. And in my opinion the best horror films have come out between the 60's and the 80's and House Of A 1000 Corpses, was a breath of fresh air from some of the other dreadful horror movies that have been released within the last few years. Because of this I became a fan of Rob Zombie, and his music as well. So, I was highly anticipating The Devil's Rejects. And, I was very pleased with it. Rob Zombie once again shows a neat visual style and makes the film look and feel like it was made in the 70's for the drive in market like other cult horror films such as The Last House On The Left. This film is also more violent, longer and darker than House Of A 1000 Corpses, and we get to know the characters better and for all these reasons I thought The Devil's Rejects, was even better than House Of 1000 Corpses. The film has great atmosphere, is gritty and looks and feels like the 70's cult and exploitation films I love, entertaining, full of energy, is tense, has some humorous scenes, is stylish, unrelenting and savage as well as very twisted and dark and I loved every minute of it. I think fans of House Of 1000 Corpses, will find this film a worthy sequel as well (and some like me may even like it better) and true die hard horror fans will like the gritty 70's atmosphere and style of the film as well as the film's never ending energy or the fact that the film is not scared to be brutal and show many thinks which will turn some viewers right off. The Devil's Rejects, is a great homage to those 70's horror and revenge films and is one of today's best horror films in the last few years where most of the time we get watered down PG-13 horror films that are rated that way probably because only people under 13 will like them. This is the real deal and the horror film you have been waiting for. I hope as well as music that Rob Zombie, will continue making horror films because he is very good at it and has already developed a cult following for both films.",The Devil's Rejects
81,jluis1984,Solid tribute to 70s grind-house,8,15 June 2006,"When Rob Zombie debuted in 2003 with his ""House of 1000 Corpses"", he exceeded the expectations of those who where not expecting much of the musician turned filmmaker. While far from perfect, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was a very well done mix of horror and black comedy that payed tribute to the 70s horror movies, with a special dedication to Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Telling the tale of the psychotic Firefly clan, the movie quickly achieved cult-status but Zombie still wanted more.In ""The Devil's Rejects"", Zombie concludes the Firefly's story of murder and mayhem in a harsher, and definitely less comedic way. Months after the events depicted in ""House of 1000 Corpses"", the police raids the Firefly house capturing Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) and apparently killing Tiny (Matthew McGrory) and Rufus (Tyler Mane). Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) manage to escape alive and ask help to their friend, the Captain Spaulding (Sid Haigh). The three mass murderers will face the wrath of a cop as disturbed as them, Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (William Forsythe).Written by Zombie himself, the movie is a remorseless tale of murder and violence that explores two sides of the same coin, with an intelligence and wit not found in Zombie's previous movie. This film takes no concessions, and while at times it seems that Zombie tries to make us feel sympathy for the characters, the ruthless violence both sides display makes obvious that this is not what the director wanted. This is not a simple ""good versus evil"" horror film, it is a violent clash between two kinds of psychos.Taking out the surrealist horror of the first movie and adding more of the 70s gritty exploitation violence, the movie looks and almost feels as if it had been done in that era. Visually the film is less gory than the first movie, but the violence is a thousand times more disturbing. Zombie learned his lesson and by focusing more on the characters than in the look of the film he crafts a film with depth and well developed characters.The acting is very good for the most part, with Sid Haigh giving a terrific performance as the Captain Spaulding, probably the most complex character of the film. Bill Moseley as Otis is quite good as the sadistic killer and while her character was a bit annoying, Sheri Moon did a good job as Baby. Leslie Easterbook has a couple of terrific scenes that show how underrated she was as an actress. William Forsythe is very good on his role, but his character suffers a bit of lack of development and Ken Foree is a bit underused. Still, the acting was overall very good and superior to Zombie's last film.While the movie is very good in many ways, it also suffers from some small flaws that hurt the film. The main problem is that while the Firelfy are very well-rounded characters, its counterparts are left as mere stereotypes. Sheriff Wydell and his two hired mercenaries are never as explored as the gang of murderers and therefore at times the film look as a gratuitous glorification of violence. While Zombie's skills as a writer have improved, he needs to work a bit more on some aspects as this makes the film feel unpolished.Definitely this film is not for everyone, as its disturbing violence and premise may not be of everyone's taste. Still, horror fans and specially fans of 70s grind-house films must give it a look. Sure, it may not be classic, but the film proves that Zombie has the potential of becoming a serious master of horror. 8/10",The Devil's Rejects
82,gregsrants,A bloodbath of brutality - not your ideal date movie,4,24 July 2005,"As I sat in the theatre prior to the start of Rob Zombie's new violent bloodbath, The Devil's Rejects, a young couple entered and sat in front of me. They were 18 or 19 tops and came in hand in hand. She looked as wholesome as Laura Ingalls and he looked like he could have come straight from choir practice. He held down the seat for her and then offered to go out for popcorn or a drink if she so desired. They seemed as innocent and as pure a couple as I had seen a young pair in some time.This was going to be good.The Devil's Rejects doesn't take long to reveal the type of film to which the next 90 or so minutes will be spent. A towering creature of a man with a bag over his head carries a fully naked dead woman by the feet through the woods. Before the opening credits are revealed, there is a stabbing, a scene where the living lay in rest next to the naked bodies of the dead, multiple images of dead corpses in various stages of decay and a police shootout that leaves a few cops on the wrong side of living.We were now only a few minutes into the film and already I was having just as much fun watching the reactions of the two in front of me as I was savoring the gratuitous violence displayed on the large screen. He looked to be somewhat enjoying himself, while she was definitely not amused. More on them later.The Devil's Rejects follows the violent exploits of the Firefly family. They are a murderous family that are responsible for countless disappearances and deaths in the Texas area. But when the Texas Rangers lead by Sheriff Wydell lead a raid on the House of Corpses, Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sherri Moon) and clown faced Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) go on the run leaving a trail of blood and bodies from film set to film set.The fist stop is at a run down motel where two unsuspecting couples become hostages for Otis and Baby. Their encounter is both obscene and disturbing and anyone who knows Rob Zombie knows that the ending to their ordeal will not be pleasant. Some are shot, all are humiliated and what the final survivor is subjected to is that of NC-17 and X-rated thinking.It was here that the girl sitting in front of me left for the first time. I could tell since she didn't whisper over to her mate that she was going to the washroom, or grabbing a drink, that it was just too much for her at that time. I was distracted from the film somewhat as I was trying to keep an eye both on the action unfolding and the reaction of the young man. Would he leave too? Is he wondering where she might be? He actually looked confused about her departure. Not concerned mind you, but concerned.She returned about 10 minutes later. Didn't ask what had transpired in her absence and continued to watch the film as if a fresh air break was an essential requirement. The next scene took the evading Firefly family to a whorehouse community where they met up with king pimp Charlie (Ken Foree). Drugs, partying and sex ensue, so I again was distracted by the youngins.She now showed all the signs of someone who was incredibly uncomfortable and ready to leave at any time. She held her head against her fist. She ran her fingers through her hair with every bloodsplat and she would shake her head side to side in a disagreeing fashion as the violence continued to escalate.By the time Sheriff Wydell hires two thugs to help capture the family so that he could take them back to their home (yeah, that makes sense) and inflict his own brand of justice, she had reached the end of her tether and walked out for now the third time. As the final shoot-out ensued, she came back, took the hand of the young man who I am guessing picked the film of viewing that evening and walked out.The above story is exactly whey I can't recommend The Devil's Rejects. Although the film pays homage to the drive in movies and low budget horror flicks of the seventies, it just doesn't fit in circa 2005. Also known as House of 1000 Corpses 2, this was Rob Zombie's second stab at terrorizing those brave enough to pay for his efforts. House of 1000 Corpses ended up on my worst of list a few years back and although The Devil's Rejects doesn't get my validation, it is a step up from his previous attempt. The only problem is that the step up lead to a step out the aisle and countless steps towards the car in what has to be the worst date movie choice since I brought my fiancée to see Thelma & Louise while trying to make up for a fight.",The Devil's Rejects
83,rainking_es,Zombie's tribute to Texas Chainsaw Massacre saga,6,4 May 2007,"In ""The house of 1000 Corpses"" Rob Zombie introduced us an adorable family of psychos so influenced by Leatehrface and company. It was kind o an teenage-horror B-movie with touches of the trash culture. Now, if in ""The house..."" the victims were what the movie was about in ""The devil's rejects"" the protagonists are the executioners, that lovely family with the sexy Sheri Moon (Zombie's wife) in the lead fields. So we learn new torture techniques, the blood gets up to our ankles, and the number of ""f***"" by second might have established a new Guinness record. Is there any difference between ""The house..."" and ""The devil's.."". Well, it looks like Rob has learn a coup,e of things about filming in these years. He does not moves the camera like a madman anymore and there are not 1000 frames/second. Also, the soundtrack is full of the best southern rock.Funny and loutish.

84,witster18,"predictable, but undeniably disturbing",8,1 June 2010,"If the measure of a horror film is in it's ability or inability to disturb the viewer - then 'The Devil's Rejects' is a solid entry into the horror genre.This is Zombie's finest work. There is a throwback 70's feel to the film. Some clever editing and rock'n'roll music adds to the overall style, sound, and appearance.Rob successfully blends some vintage horror actors, and other fresh new faces. The acting, overall, is excellent.What makes this a great horror film - is rejects' ability to keep us in suspense with gore and tension. There are virtually NO jump scares, and to be honest, the film doesn't need them. It relies solely on it's disturbing storyline and the hopelessness of the innocent to keep the viewer glued to the screen with one eye closed. 84/100There are some predictability issues with the plot, and a couple of unnecessary cgi shots, other than that, The Devil's Rejects succeeds mightily.Has the same disturbing tone of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Deliverance. Top ten in the genre over the last decade. A highly recommended horror sleeper for those in search of that 'uneasy if not queesy' feeling.You'll like it if you liked: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Deliverance, House of 1,000 Corpses, and The Hills Have Eyes(orig).",The Devil's Rejects

I understand that budgets can be tight for any movie that isn't Twilight or Transformers related, especially a horror movie budget, I get that. Hey and Rob Zombie is not Kubrick, he doesn't need to be, he's his own thing and he's never tried to top the Master Of Horror, Stanley Mother F*cking Kubrick, again, I get that.

86,sashank_kini-1,"Can't watch it with my parents, for sure!",8,27 August 2011,"I personally find the Final Destination series to be infinitely overrated. All the films have elaborate, Lady Gaga like death sequences, and the viewer simply has to wait for everyone to die. Bowling ball rolls down rack, hits a couple of books which in turn fall on a balance, whose weights go up in the air, land in a fish tank, crushing the fish and breaking the tank, causing a short circuit in the oxygen tank wire, creating a spark, bringing down the curtain, which blows in the wind and touches a girl standing outside, whose hair catches fire, and she falls into a pool of oil spilled on the road by a nearby truck and dies. 15 minutes for this silly death is what sums up FD.And then there is this little film which is bounteous in its gore and profound in its depiction of torture and sadism. And I like it. Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects has three bad characters in the lead roles who have committed more than 5 barbaric murders and indulge in many other heinous acts of depravity. There is Baby Firefly, the little angel with a potty mouth who is more of a masochist, and then there's her brother Otis, a crazy man who enjoys inflicting pain to his victims. Mama Firefly is a prostitute who is so libidinous she doesn't even stop her act in jail. She is very vile and disgusting, who smacks her tongue to men as well as dead bodies. Clown Saunders is another deadly guy who is not really funny to his spectators.All four are so dirty-minded they kill, rape, sodomize their victims for fun. When Mama Firefly is captured, Baby and Otis escape to a motel, where they 'play' with a couple of singers. This little act is dreadfully vicious but at the same time irresistible. The deeds were terrible but never for a second did I feel to stop the film because its acted quite well. Anyway, Sheriff Wydell has to handle the case, but it becomes a personal vendetta as the movie progresses. I don't mind bloody gore; it's bone cracking that unnerves me. So I didn't have any objection to the gore in the film, which is a bucketful. The road kill scene is extraordinary and repulsive, and looks so real. The bads guys are strangely likable in some parts, and its a feat for Rob Zombie to keep a balance in them so that they don't become too unlikeable. The story is simple but its well made and well acted. Its one of the best gore films I've seen in recent times. 8/10 and two thumbs up if the Devil's Rejects have spared my thumbs!",The Devil's Rejects
87,Bogmeister,More Bloody Depravity from the Seventies,7,27 February 2006,"Rob Zombie's follow-up to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" plunges us back into the depraved embrace of the so-called Firefly family, a nutty bunch of murderous wackos causing havoc back in '78 (supposedly - based on references, this all takes place just after the ""Star Wars"" craze began). Zombie polished up his film-making skills and offers a more, uh, fleshed out interpretation on the psycho family, headed by Sid Haig with his two offspring; momma (Easterbrook, replacing Karen Black from the previous flic) gets captured early on in a raid by police, which are led by an obsessed lawman (Forsythe - very good, as usual). Forsythe specializes in unlikable characters - there's just something unpleasant about him - so even though he's presented as the law, or the good side, the audience may very well side with the psychotic family by the end.Zombie manages this confusing set-up on who to root for by also presenting the killers as almost childlike, as if they're not really aware that their acts are horrible; this is especially true of the daughter, 'Baby' (Moon), who comes off as being just a cute preening blonde who sometimes likes to wave a gun around. It all plays off that old outlaw principle, such as 'Bonnie & Clyde' - even though they are murderous killers, most people still can't help but romanticize their carefree attitude - they do what they want when they want to. By contrast, the law, embodied by Forsythe, are the strict unrelenting adults, here driven slightly crazy by revenge. Forsythe is driven to commit acts almost as heinous, but doesn't have the carefree charm to fall back on. Because of the conflict between the major players, the plot is pretty action driven and suspenseful, far more interesting than the previous film. There's a central set piece in a motel room which again emulates '70s psycho-horror films such as ""Last House on the Left"" where-in psycho killers torture common citizens who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, before killing them, of course. Zombie ratchets up the intensity during this sequence.Watch for some near-iconic actors from the seventies in fleeting roles, such as P.J. Soles (""Halloween""), Mary Woronov (""Death Race 2000"") and Michael Berryman (""The Hills Have Eyes"")... so what next, Zombie?",The Devil's Rejects

Mother has been arrested while the rest of the family have fled as they hit the road to pray on more innocent people with their crimes of killing and kidnapping. For only the Sheriff and the police go on a manhunt for them as they are ordered to shoot to kill.Gory and hilarious horror comedy sensation from Rob Zombie is definitely an improvement over his debut movie ""House of 1000 Corpses""! The film co-stars Danny Trejo, Ken Foree, and Michael Barryman (""The original Hills Have Eyes"") in one hell of a roller-coaster ride that is shocking and funny at the same time. The film has the feel of those 70's and early 80's Grindhouse cinema flicks that Zombie himself adores so much topped with gore such as a woman being squashed by a truck, sleaze, great performances and a dark sense of humor. The direction by Rob Zombie is stylish, the showdown near the end is kickass as hell here.Fans of the horror genre including grindhouse style cinema should view this movie, it's one of my favorites and a must see!",The Devil's Rejects
89,WriterDave,Well.....,6,8 August 2005,"Okay, so Rob Zombie has matured a bit as a director since ""House of 1000 Corpses."" He deserves some credit here for sustaining a mood and tone throughout ""Devil's Rejects"" that all but erases that slap-dash style of its predecessor. While this serves nicely as a rock-solid homage to 1970's splatter-house horror, it still ultimately is a sick, sadistic, totally amoral, and pointless film, and thus I ultimately can't rate it any higher than ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" which at least had that novelty act thing going for it.Still, this is easily the better film from a critic's standpoint. A great classic rock soundtrack (I loved the opening credits!), some great fodder for movie buffs (the scene where the Sheriff enlists the help of a movie critic obsessed with Groucho Marx is a riot), and a truly deeply dark and sick sense of humor (gone are the carnival theatrics of ""House of 1000 Corpses and instead we get the stunning character development when we get to witness our merry band of serial killers debate whether or not they should stop for ice cream while on the run) keep the film watchable and entertaining on a certain level.Again, like its predecessor, it has a lame ending that reminded me of ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Bonny and Clyde"". Zombie has the ability to keep a solid tone to his films now, if only he would enlist some outside help in script writing to invoke an ending worthy of his set-ups, then he might finally be able to deliver the horror classic he so desperately wants to craft.",The Devil's Rejects

This is a truly depraved, sick, disgusting, perverted piece of horror cinema. It has been a long time since I have been truly disgusted by a movie.This follow up to House of 1000 Corpses is based on a brutal road trip that 3 of the Firefly family members go on. After a shoot-out at their farmhouse, Otis and Baby (soon joined by Capt. Spaulding) escape and start their rampage. Mother is captured and brought for interrogation. The Sheriff, John Wydell, is out for revenge for the death of his brother in the first film and soon sets out to kill them all.Rob Zombie has outdone himself with this film. It captures the heart of many 70's horror films. If you look closely, you'll even find many old actors here and there. Ken Foree from Dawn of the Dead and Michael Berryman from The Hills Have Eyes are two of the easily recognisable ones. Bill Moseley, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon return return as the crazy, sadistic Firefly family.The acting from all these people is fine, not one performance is stupid or over-done. The music for the movie is great and the movie looks very good. The only problem is the dialogue, which I found had a lot of unnecessary swearing, but that isn't a huge problem.For those that are squeamish and don't like violence, this isn't your movie. This movie contains a lot of realistic, harsh, disgusting acts of violence and perversion. But for the horror fan, this is perfect for you.4½/5.",The Devil's Rejects
91,OriginalMovieBuff21,Probably one of the first best horror films I've seen in the last 20 years or so....and that's sad,8,8 July 2006,"The Devil's Rejects is the sequel to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" that is set months later with the Texas State Police making a full scale attack against the murderous Firefly family residence for the 1,000+ murders and disappearances of the past several years. As two of the Firefly family escape from an attack from the police, they go on another murderous rampage. This film was highly enjoyable from beginning to end. Although the film is highly sick and brutal, it never really seized to distract me. I also thought the film was a lot more realistic than other horror films and that the good guys and bad guys didn't win. The direction by Rob Zombie was done well and I thought the soundtrack was very good with a couple of my favorite songs being in there. Overall, I thought this could probably be the best horror film in the last 20 years because of its realism and how people can become so sick and bizarre. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",The Devil's Rejects
92,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: The Devil's Rejects (2005),9,22 July 2005,"Sunrise at the Firefly homestead and the sun is creeping in the sky. But the sun is not the only thing creeping, so is a couple dozen of the local sheriff's department slowly surrounding the main house. In a massive hail of bullets that leaves the house like a box of Swiss cheese, the Firefly's (Otis, Baby and Mama) fight back with equal ferocity and the coolest armor. But the family gets broken up when Mother Firefly is captured; Otis and Baby must hit the road to get away. Sheriff Rydell has a beef with the Firefly's (they killed his brother in House of 1,000 Corpses) and he will hunt them to the ends of the asphalt for his revenge.""Rejects"" just plain rocks. Rob Zombie returns with this follow-up to his 2003 hit ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". And brother you ain't seen nothing yet. One thing is a definite; this guy loves 70's horror and spares nothing in this full-blown homage to the 70's. Zombie has grown in leaps and bounds as a filmmaker. Visually the film oozes with southwestern grit and the kind of charm only a scorpion would enjoy. This time around the photography, camera-work and edition take center stage as Zombie employ's a better technical crew this time around an pulls out all those lovely 70's camera tricks (freeze-frames and great scene transitions for start). The music soundtrack is killer with an amazing southwestern and southern flavor that punctuates the film perfectly (everything from the Allman Brothers to Buck Owens and beyond). The musical score is as dark and menacing as the action on screen. The acting is the final bond that makes this film completely work. The evil trio of ""Rejects"" Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), Otis (Bill Moseley and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) own their parts and tear up the screen and everyone in their wake. These guys ARE the film. Why are you still reading this? Go get a ticket, grab a soda and some popcorn and get ""Rejected"". Exploitation fans won't be disappointed in the least.",The Devil's Rejects
93,Aylmer,99% excellent casting decisions does not a good 70's style horror movie make...,3,25 April 2008,"Rob Zombie's first film HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES was a full blown NATURAL BORN KILLERS wannabe, complete with Oliver Stone inspired direction. Here Zombie has shifted into Quentin Tarantino / Robert Rodriguez territory with a 70's-style road movie with snappy dialog. While the plot is nothing to write home about and the CGI gore terribly uneven, at least the film has some excellent casting. We are treated to amazing cameo after cameo, from Tom Towles (HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) to Steve Railsback (of ESCAPE 2000) to Deb Van Valkenburg (THE WARRIORS) to even Michael Berryman (HILLS HAVE EYES), not the mention Ken Foree, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, etc. It's AWESOME to see all these great underrated actors share the screen.The problem with a lot of these awesome cameos is that the characters often feel as though they were written in JUST to have an excuse to plug the B-movie star cameo in. Say with Berryman's character - did he really perform ANY function whatsoever? The main thing that kills this movie (besides the extreme heavyhandedness and pretentious approach) is the fact that nothing happens in it. A scant number of people are murdered and we don't know enough about them to feel any shock or loss. It just sort of happens and Zombie lacks the skill to give it any impact. Captain Spaulding is presented as an ultimate badass, but look at his tally - he beats up an old woman and head-butts a girl. That's it! Just tossing in a scene of him biting someone's ear off would have made him actually scary or something... but no, he's just a jerk in clown make-up. I love Sid Haig, he's the first movie star I ever talked to, but he, along with everyone else involved, is completely underutilized. A lot of potential wasted.The one actor who does get a generous share of screen time is William Forsythe as the angry psycho scummy sheriff, but he really plays a variation of that character in every other movie he's in... and how he meets his clever end is a completely uncalled for Deus-Ex Machina, a true ""WTF"" moment that kills what little tension and believability this film had.Other problems include oppressive rock music (well duh, Zombie got his start with metal) and too many movie references. It should be wowing fanboys like me, but instead it's just obvious and boring.Still, much better than Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN, which similar to this film was totally without merit besides the neat casting decisions.",The Devil's Rejects
94,MichaelMargetis,"""I'm not callin' you a chicken f*cker but that boy over there looks sexually frustrated, and I don't approve of chicken f*cking. "" - Darrell",6,13 November 2005,"I had extensively low expectations of Rob Zombie's latest ridiculous-looking blood/guts/gore/terror horror movie. The reason is because I knew what to expect after seeing one of 2003's worst movies known as 'House of 1000 Corpses' which was Zombie's debut into the film-making game. 'House of 1000 Corpses' was just plain terrible with sadistic and totally gratuitous violence. Usually I have a pretty high tolerance for gore but leaving 'House of 1000 Corpses' I felt absolutely sickened. So going to see 'The Devel's Rejects' I pretty much pre-determined it was going to suck -- but it didn't. 'The Devil's Rejects' isn't a great movie and it sure as hell doesn't compare to the films such as 'Natural Born Killers' or the immortal 'Bonnie & Clyde' it kind of impersonates, but 'The Devil's Rejects' has a lot of humor, energy and originality making it one of the best horror movies of 2005. It's a sick-ass unsettling movie but it has a wicked sense of style.'The Devil's Rejects' is a semi-sequel to 'House of 1000 Corpses'. The story takes place just a little while after the events of 'Corpses', when the local police led by Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe - in a hilarious show-stopping performance) are raiding the Firefly family residence, a house filled with such vile and horrific things it makes John Wayne Gacy's house look like Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. The cops storm the house capture the mother, but the sick and twisted son Otis (Bill Moseley - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Pt. 2) and his equally as terrifying (but HOT) sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie - Rob Zombie's wife). The two brother/sister team are on the run but still killing poor innocent victims in horrific and unspeakable ways and are joined by Baby's father, Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig - Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman) a dirty-toothed redneck clown who owns a small local circus. The three go on a disgusting high-octane killing spree, and at the same time are being tracked down by Sheriff Wydell and his men. Will Wydell be able to stop this murdering maniacs? Rent 'The Devil's Rejects' and see for yourself.In every sense of the word the plot of this film is stupid with a capital S. It's supposed to be. It's a mindless slasher flick -- to the naked eye. It's not the plot or main idea that makes 'The Devil's Rejects' so appealing, it's the little things. The Groucho Marx and old movie references, the 70s music references, the dry off-beat humor spewing from the serial killers mouths and a singing of the 'Tootie-Fruitty' song. All these things make 'The Devil's Rejects' just so different from other horror flicks -- this film unlike most horror flicks has a pulse. Rob Zombie does a great job filming this with really cool cinematography. The acting isn't half-bad with a lot of cameos and three decent performances from the three leads especially Sid Haig who is so perfect for his role. William Forsythe steals the movie though with his part. Be forewarned though, this movie is extremely gory, sadistic and violent. Only the strongest of stomachs will be able to handle the atrocities against humanity Mr. Rob Zombie has so anxiously in store for you in 'The Devil's Rejects'. It's not a great movie by any scope of the imagination, but I actually liked it. What is this movie? It's a straight-up slasher flick. 'The Devil's Rejects' doesn't try to be better or dramatic it just is what it is. It can be considered (I can't believe I'm actually saying this about a Rob Zombie movie) a ""good"" movie. If ""horror"" is your genre, you'll LOVE 'The Devil's Rejects'. Grade: B-my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",The Devil's Rejects

The quote itself is an extrapolation from Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible'  though it's doubtful fans of this film will know that  and it's telling that Zombie has his lead killer Otis (Manson-a-like Bill Moseley) pronounce these same words to his victim. Because this is a film tailor-made for the kind of sad sickos who venerate Manson and pals as anti-establishment heroes.

97,baileycrawly,Zombie Strikes Again,9,8 July 2020,"One important factor to look at when it comes to sequels is whether or not it justifies its existence. A good sequel needs to expand upon the work that began with the original in a meaningful and entertaining way, which is exactly what The Devil's Rejects did.If House of 1000 Corpses was Rob Zombie's love letter to the genre and a glimpse into his dark mind, The Devil's Rejects is his all-out, relentless explorations of the darkest recesses of that mind, handled by a fantastic creative team working alongside him to make this effort even better than the one that came before it.This is a slow-burning film with a lot of nasty, gritty violence that is guaranteed to upset some of the more sensitive viewers. It takes what was done in its predecessor and takes everything a step beyond, resulting in a film that is not only full of gore but also suspenseful. Just as with the first film, the last 15 minutes of this film are nail-bitingly tense and keep you on the edge of your seat.Rob Zombie is clearly more comfortable with directing in this film, and he showcases more of his talents and abilities in an extremely satisfying follow-up that leaves the viewer wanting more.",The Devil's Rejects

99,HEFILM,skin deep cruelty can't support a whole movie,4,22 July 2005,"Rob Zombie's best gift is collecting B and exploitation actors of the past and giving them funny and meaty roles in this and his previous film. This time he adds a very funny Ken Foree to the mix very memorably, though Mary Woronov's cameo is wordless and kind of useless as well. Also flying in from outer space is Priscilla Barnes, why Zombie would put her in the movie is beyond reason, but she is great in her part--basically one long humiliation scene which she manages to give humanity too which is lacking everywhere else in the film.Unlike the first wildly out of control film, this one only has one style. It's shot like someone who has smoked too much grass and is sitting too close to the TV. It's all grain and shaky camera-work that gets old real fast. This strips the film of any suspense or surprise since it's all shot the same way. Sure it's grainy on purpose, I guess, but frame it up like a film not a ""this is your brain on drugs"" commercial Rob.Ultimately the problem is that for all the blood and killing on display the film has no psychological terror to put it over the top, or at least keep you engaged emotionally. The villains treat each other with as much contempt as they do their victims. The psycho family doesn't make sense as a family unit. Big problem.The odd comic relief works but where is the real nasty edge that he pretends to have. There is none, he's still a bit too much of a film fan to actually make a film of his own. He's got some subversive ideas but doesn't express them with any real shock or lasting focus because he's too busy making, not really a horror film, but a exploitation film along the line of an Al Adamson movie. Zombie has talent, Adamson had none, but make a real whole movie Rob. Don't be afraid to tell us what you really think and stop just telling us what movies you really like. Hopefully he'll get to make more films, he's got the casting thing down, though this time he's a bit too interesting in showing us his wife's butt crack. In many ways a good try but not a success. For the real deal see the films he's copying from and see what he's missing.",The Devil's Rejects
100,domino1003,A Bloody Tribute to 70's Movies,10,27 November 2005,"You gotta hand it to director Rob Zombie, he sure can create an intense storyline. As ""The Devil's Rejects"" opens, we are told about events that occurred in 1978 in which 75 people were brutally murdered in a farmhouse. We see lots of policemen surrounding the house and having a shootout with the inhabitants inside. Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook, far from her ""Police Academy"" days)is captured, but Otis (Bill Moseley)and his sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie, the director's wife) escape. Soon to hook up with them is their father, Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig). This man will give you a good reason to hate clowns:He is the creepiest, nastiest, disturbing clown you'll ever want to see in your life.They also have Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe, in his most brutal performance to date), who has a serious grudge against them: It seems that these guys killed his brother, and he's is taking this VERY personal.While on the run, the vicious trio kidnap, brutalize and kill pretty much everyone on their path. Eventually, the sheriff and the trio cross paths, and things get really ugly.This is the sequel to Zombie's first film, ""House of 1000 Corpses."" If you haven't seen the first one, then you may not get the full enjoyment of ""The Devil's Rejects."" That doesn't mean you won't like this. If you remember films like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Last House On The Left,"" then you can get a good vibe on the film. Interesting cast includes Geoffrey Lewis, Priscilla Barnes, P.J.

101,Flagrant-Baronessa,Don't watch this alone,7,31 October 2006,"Not because it's ""too scary"" to watch alone in the dark, but simply because watching it with a group of friends will definitely enrich the whole twisted experience that is 'The Devil's Rejects', particularly the gruesome unrated version. This is hard-boiled, hard-edged, vile, gritty, gory and graphic gorefest at its finest.Hype and occasional missteps aside, I think Rob Zombie has created something quite unique and fun in the genre  a sort of clear-eyed but grossly over-the-top white-trash tits 'n' torture freak-show of gore, sex and violence en masse. What is most admirable is that Mr. Zombie actually seems to know what he is doing with the content instead of dishing out gore galore to create headlines. The fact is that the narrative, the characters and the no-nonsense approach all function by remaining clear-cut and down-to-earth while the madness of the story exponentially increases. So what is the story? It is a modern day Bonnie & Clyde in which the fugitive family Firefly indulge in orgies of gore and killing sprees on a road-trip in the South. All the while the Texas State Police contingent headed by Sheriff John Quincy Wydell (a raspy-voiced William Forsythe) slowly close in on the family  capture the offenders at any cost, even if that means enlisting gruesome bounty hunters. In this way the police are neither the pro- nor antagonists in the film and Forsythe aptly brings that delicious moral ambiguity to his Sheriff character.Conversely, the Firefly family certainly offer no moral safeground. They kill like they mean business  a sort of sick, seedy and sadistic business, true, but still business  and indeed you hold more disgust than sympathy for the quartet even though you are highly absorbed by them. On that note, Sheri Moon delivers the best performance by a playboy model I have ever seen. Danny Trejo also looks right at home in a sleazy thug character that pops up at one point in 'The Devil's Rejects' and the remaining cast look equally comfortable as hard-edged whitetrash.What undoubtedly contributes to the perpetual sense of immediate danger in the film is the kinetic, dizzying camera-work that Zombie opts for. It can be a cheap-shot to quicken the pace in films (I'm looking at you, Tony Scott) but in 'The Devil's Rejects' is all fits with the violent action style. But the film is not all action and certainly there is an underlying horror vibe that often bubbles up underneath the bottled lid and gives rise to truly frightening scenarios such as Forsythe chasing after someone with an axe. It ticks off some horror clichés during the way but always with humour and rawness as opposed to the unimaginative run-of-the-mill teen horrors that treat the same scenarios as dutiful inclusions.Ultimately The Devil's Rejects is mostly flashy and fun and would possibly fall apart at closer analysis. But Mr. Analysist himself  Roger Ebert  gave the film two thumbs up which should serve as a mark of its high entertainment factor. Its cast and content both tread a fine line between straight and camp and tip over into both categories at several points. Finally, the end scene is one of the strongest I have ever seen, no hyperbole, and it elevates Rejects even further above generic gross-out formula.7 out of 10",The Devil's Rejects
102,hokeybutt,Sensitive Souls... You Best Not Be Watching This...,7,9 August 2005,"THE DEVIL'S REJECTS (3+ outta 5 stars) A very well-made piece of brutal entertainment with absolutely no socially-redeeming qualities whatsoever. Writer-director Rob Zombie may not reference his film influences as overtly as Quentin Tarantino even though he was clearly brought up seeing and admiring many of the same movies. Zombie borrows lightly from classic exploitation movies of the past and injects enough of his own original vision to create something that is wholly different... and not just a re-hash of what's been done before. The ""heroes"" of this movie are members of the repellent ""Firefly Family"", a family of serial-killing white trash weirdos who have to go on the run after a vengeful cop makes it his mission in life to wipe them out. (Hey, they did kill the guy's brother, after all.) For the first half of the movie the Fireflys are the aggressors... killing and torturing innocent folks for no reason but their own sick thrills. They turn out to be such charismatic villains, however, that you almost start to feel sorry for them when they are, in turn, captured and tortured by someone else. Sid Haig, Sheri Moon Zombie and Bill Moseley have a field day playing the ""rejects"", alternately horrible and amusing. Yes, this is one of those movies that turns kids into serial killers... so if you are a sensitive soul you best not be watching this.",The Devil's Rejects

I honestly don't see why.Now I know my ""useful comment"" rating is going to be horrible for saying this, but I think its true. I honestly thought House was better. But don't get me wrong, this was still a good movie. Captain Spaulding, Otis Driftwood, and Baby Firefly return to cause more havoc and destruction. Only this time, they're on the road, running from the law. Lt. George Wydell's brother, Sheriff John Quincy Wydell has come to avenge him. John is insane and will do anything to exact revenge on the family. He's well played by William Forsythe. We also have new allies for Spaulding and them, including an old friend of Spaulding's, Charlie Altamont, who was wonderfully played by Ken Foree. Here we have some interesting kills and scenes, and some which are actually pretty lousy. I have to admit, this movie had some pretty disappointing scenes, and lacked the camera-work/music score of the first film. Plus, this movie didn't have that eerie feeling that the first one did. I know I'm gonna get it for this comment, but so be it. I liked House better and I'm sticking to what I say. I did enjoy this movie however. It does live up to many expectations.

105,Gafke,Wow,9,25 March 2006,"This sequel to Zombie's debut film House Of 1000 Corpses picks up where that film left off, continuing the story of the deranged Firefly clan. Weeks or perhaps months have passed since the events of 1000 Corpses, and the police raid the Firefly ranch, engaging the dangerous family in a full blown gunfight. Otis Driftwood and his sister Baby escape the carnage and are on the run. Mother Firefly is arrested and taken into custody by Sheriff John Quincy Wydell, the brother of Lieutenant George Wydell who was brutally murdered in the first film by the Firefly's. Otis and Baby alert Baby's father, the sadistic clown Captain Spaulding, of the raid and the three fugitives team up, leaving a bloody trail of murder and destruction behind them as they flee across Texas. But Wydell is right behind them and with the help of a couple of bounty hunters, he corners the threesome in a whorehouse run by Spaulding's brother Charlie. But Wydell has gone over the edge. He no longer wants justice, he wants revenge. This is an amazing and beautiful film, so different from its predecessor that it seems like an entirely different story with a brand new director. Ditching the day-glo, psychedelic splatter of 1000 Corpses, Zombie goes in for a gritty Western feel; part Tarantino-ish gangster/road movie and with some Peckinpah inspired violence, Rejects never lets up, not for one second. It's harsh, sadistic, sickeningly brutal and funny as hell. Everyone in the film turns in an amazing performance and the cast reads like a cult film roll call: Michael Berryman, Steve Railsback, Danny Trejo, PJ Soles, Daniel Roebuck, Priscilla Barnes, Deborah Van Valkenburg and EG Daily all turn up in small but important roles and each delivers an outstanding and memorable performance. Likewise the leads, Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, Sid Haig and William Forsythe are absolutely amazing and totally convincing, truly inhabiting their characters. Leslie Easterbrook is a jaw-dropper as the psychotic Mother Firefly, taking over the role from Karen Black and making it her own. She is unforgettable. The ensemble cast never once threatens to overpower the film - they become the film and make you forget for two hours that they're actors.The violence is vicious and plentiful and is not for everyone. Consider yourselves warned. In particular, the scene between Otis and Priscilla Barnes is almost impossible to watch without cringing; it is deeply disturbing. Beautifully photographed and boasting a killer soundtrack to boot, The Devils Rejects is a triumphant sequel to House of 1000 Corpses and is a huge improvement as well. Zombie proves himself to be a filmmaker to watch with this impressive effort. Very highly recommended, not only to fans of Zombie but to anyone who appreciates the action films of the 70s such as Straw Dogs, The Wild Bunch and Bonnie & Clyde. This is a great homage to those films, but it also stands all on its own, defying categorization. Just see it.",The Devil's Rejects

The story splits into two, when the police are ambushed, leading the film into multiple genre territories beyond just straight up horror, such police procedural, psychological thriller, and road flick, to name a few.Anyone familiar with Rob Zombie's music might have a fair number of expectations for his film-making pursuits. His music is layered through high production, it rumbles along in wild abandon, and it plays frequent homage to cool bits from film's past. ""The Devil's Rejects"" shows that Zombie has learned a thing or two about film-making since ""1,000 Corpses"", which felt like an overzealous, highly disturbing music video with a singular purpose: to shock.Strangely, for the grim nature that permeates much of the story and the believable insanity conveyed by the villains, ""Devil's Rejects"" is far less dehumanizing an experience than ""1,000 Corpses"". Zombie has a figured out a way to turn his killers into characters, as opposed to the creepy haunted house dummies they were in the earlier film. This is not the sort of flick that's going to earn the horror genre any new fans, but it is one that will give fans a reason to continue singing its praises.",The Devil's Rejects

People who kill for fun on the lam from the law on a spree that we know can't possibly end well. It had the classic 70's ending, which for those who remember those movies- is dark. No happy endings because it's better that way. There is a good redneck soundtrack of beer drinkin hell raisin tunes and a lot of crusty evil characters, the kind you find still raising hell at 5am in a biker bar down south. I really liked the retro feel of this movie but I think the script got a little lost in how to end the movie. It had a great start but then it sort of just kind of tied up the loose ends and stopped playing. I am all for a dark ending but how about something a little more intricate? I felt kind of cheated at the end of this film- a little more work should have been spent on a better ending.

Pretty easy premise, yet for a movie like this it doesn't need one.While House of 1000 corpses had some actual shock power in it, the devils rejects is a boring rehash that doesn't scare nor terrify. This does have violence and blood splattering everywhere, but i was yawning through it all. I felt like sleeping this just couldn't keep me interested. Only time i did pay attention was near the end when the family was getting tortured by Sheriff Wydell and when Otis was nailed to his chair. Plus this was too long, nearly going for two hours. If it was around 90 mins and didn't drag so much, it would have been so much better.This was also like a music film clip. So many time we were treated to full songs accompanied by experimental camera work. Cut all this out and just get to the point. Many have commented that Rob Zombie made it clever, spinning the bad guy ego on its head, making you sympathise with the trio, but no one in this film was redeemable nor likable; good or bad.Just sit and yawn yourself into terror when you notice that the dirt and filth on the cinema floor is a lot more scary.",The Devil's Rejects

They arrest mother Firefly, but Otis B. Driftwood and Baby Firefly escape from the siege. Tiny is wandering nearby the house and also escapes. they arrive at an isolated motel in the desert. When Otis and Baby arrive there they kidnap two families of singers,using sadism and violence against the families the Devil's Rejects is a Sequel to 'House of 1000 Corpses' also directed by Rob Zombie. It is set some months later with the Texas State Police making a full-scale attack against the Firefly family residence for the 1,000+ murders that they have committed.

111,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"OK, but nothing special!",5,20 June 2008,"Homicidal maniacs have a field day in Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects, an ultra violent spin-off from Zombie's critically reviled 2003 debut, House of 1,000 Corpses. As Zombie continues to cultivate his name-brand variety of extreme horror and splatter-film homage, he definitely takes his place among connoisseurs of carnage. In the case of The Devil's Rejects, several characters from 1,000 Corpses return for another marathon of mayhem, as the murderous Firefly family (led by Sid Haig as the maniacal ""Captain Spaulding"") turn their bloody wrath against hostages in a fleabag motel, while the local sheriff (William Forsythe) plots revenge against them for the killing of his brother. Before their inevitable showdown, Zombie has plenty of fun--perhaps a little too much fun--indulging his penchant for sick, sadistic humor and gruesome atrocity. Clearly, Zombie fancies himself as horror's answer to Quentin Tarantino, but he lacks Tarantino's gift for riveting plots and escalating tension. Instead, The Devil's Rejects is just raw, rampant excess from start to finish, paying visual tribute to gruesome classics from the '70s and guaranteed to earn the cult status that Zombie is all too obviously aiming for. He's an unabashed horror buff who's carving a niche in the genre he loves, shamelessly satisfying a small but loyal audience of sicko-pants.",The Devil's Rejects

Director Rob Zombie known for his sick and sadistic style of movies decides to make a sequel to his well known 2003 film House Of 1000 Corpses with The Devils Rejects.Now I Have Not seen House Of 1000 Corpses but I am told that the only way they are involved are the characters. So lets get down to the Rejects. There's Otis played by Bill Mosely who is the leader and more serious of the group. There's Baby played by Rob Zombies wife Sheri Moon Zombie who is the only female of the group. She is gorgeous but deadly. Finally there's Capitan Spaulding played by Sid Haig who is the wisecracker of the group who wears clown makeup but is very sadistic. For example there's a scene were he steals this woman's car but before he can take off the woman's son is still in the car. Captain Spaulding Says ""Whats the matter kid don't you like clowns? Why? You best come up with a reason for why you don't like clowns because I'm gonna come back here and check on you and your mama. If you don't got a reason for why you don't like clowns I am gonna kill your whole (Explotive Deleted) family"".Then there's Sheriif Wydell played by William Forsythe who is going after them more on a personal level because they killed his brother.Most films establish the good guys and the bad guys right from the start but by the end of the film you don't know who is who.I do have to warn you that if you have a weak stomach then this film is not for you because it is very violent and sadistic. But the story is magnificent and the characters are really likable. But there is also funny moments like when they go get ice cream Otis says "" There is no (Explotive Deleted) ice cream in your (Explotive Deleted) future"".I hope you had a nice time enjoying my October reviews.

114,ExpendableMan,"Everyone, everyone! Look at my wife's ass!",1,23 September 2007,"The Devil's Rejects, like so many other horror movies doing the rounds these days, is massively influenced by seventies exploitation cinema. Even so, despite the fact that hammer smashed blood cinema is in vogue at the moment, it's a miracle that director Rob Zombie got to make it at all. His debut, 'House of 1000 Corpses' was tied up in legal wrangles for so long it was delayed for three years and when it arrived it wasn't exactly a masterpiece either. In fact, it was more like the Batman & Robin of horror films: covered in garish neon lighting, packed with ridiculous looking characters and despite it's reputation, remarkably blood free. Critics still hailed it as a triumphant return of old school gore yet the results were plain to see, it was poorly written, badly acted and camp, rather than tense, vicious and gruelling. In a way therefore, it's not surprising that Zombie took a different direction with the follow up, doing away with the off-kilter camera and ramping up the violence to new levels. But it's still not very good at all, conclusive proof that being a fan of horror films doesn't mean you know how to make them.The film takes several characters from the previous movie and sends them on a direction-less road trip. In the opening police siege, the deranged 'Firefly' clan lose their home and while Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) and Otis (Bill Moseley) manage to escape, Mama Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is arrested and the rest of the family gunned down. Baby and Otis then hook up with the psychotic clown Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) and go on the run, pursued by a revenge obsessed police man (William Forsythe). The result is a nihilistic journey of extreme violence, taking in gunshot wounds, head injuries, cattle prod tortures and nails through hands. This would all be very well and good for gore hounds, but Zombie sabotages his own project through some spectacularly bad scripting. Most of the dialogue seems to consist of the characters screaming swear words at each other and Zombie's attempts at witty Tarantino style exchanges fall flat. Consequently, it's hard to shake the impression that he came up with ideas for several violent scenes but couldn't be bothered to put any effort into the intervening passages where people don't die horribly.And then there's the acting. Oh lord, there's the acting. Horror isn't exactly the domain of the classical thespian but The Devil's Rejects still stands out as a shining example of some of the worst displays of acting ever committed to film. Sid Haig for instance approaches his character much in the same way as the previous movie: he shouts, he grins, he laughs and his eyes bulge constantly. He's also utterly awful, convinced that being perpetually loud will translate into intensity. Sheri Moon Zombie on the other hand appears to have got the job purely on the basis of being the director's wife and is even worse than Haig. Baby is meant be a total psychotic, but she doesn't seem to be anything more than a rock star's wife suffering from the delusion that being incredibly annoying will make her scary. Elsewhere, Leslie Easterbrook goes down the route of gurning and screaming, contorting her face in a variety of interesting ways as she languishes in a jail cell but like Sheri Moon, is more irritating than scary.Laughable acting aside, there's also the problem that Zombie doesn't know what type of movie he is making. One moment it's a horror, with the Fireflies torturing and murdering a troupe of innocent bystanders in a motel bloodbath. The next it's a vigilante revenge flick with William Forsythe aggressively hunting them down, then just as quickly it switches gears into a Bonnie & Clyde style outlaw fantasy. The atrocious acting and bad scripting aside, this is the film's main fault. Zombie attempts to wring sympathy for the Fireflies, but it's very difficult to cry for people who have just abused and slaughtered passers by just to extend the running time.Two moments stand out, head and shoulders above the rest. Captain Spaulding's sex dream and waking reality at the beginning is hilarious and the final, cataclysmic 'Freebird' scene is really good. Other than that, this is an atrocious film. It goes from being a Sam Peckinpah style shoot 'em up to a horror, to a western, to a comedy and at no point feels like a fully functioning film in it's own right, more a collection of bad rip offs stitched together haphazardly. It's definitely better than House of 1000 Corpses but then deep vein thrombosis is better than House of 1000 Corpses. You won't laugh, you won't cry and you definitely won't hide your face in terror. You'll just feel frustrated every time Sheri Moon manages to escape being killed. Avoid.",The Devil's Rejects

It had some quite humerus moments, knew what it was and never took itself too seriously. It also had a pleasant amount of violence without going overboard that you would expect in such a film. My only complaint would be the amount of horror clichés and clichés in general. The ""good guys"" of the film did everything that was so inherently wrong to do in certain situations and the ""bad guys"" managed to get away at every non opportune moments. Love it or not, Rob Zombie has managed to conjure up something truly remarkable with The Devils Rejects.

116,Jacques98,This deserves to be watched. It is not just another horror movie.,4,2 October 2008,"I really have no idea what I honestly thought about The Devil's Rejects. Half of me thinks it was genius, the other halfprobably my more truthful sidethinks it was just another lame movie without a plot. But maybe it's both. Personally, I've always liked Rob Zombie's gritty style because no one else in the movie industry today seems to be able to be able to do true grit without true cheese. I wasn't impressed with Halloween, and I've never seen House of 1000 Corpses, but I'm pretty sure The Devil's Rejects is his best work, and it is a good movie. But at the same time it isn't.The good Tell me honestly, when was the last time you remembered the first name of a character in a movie, much less their ""personality"" (which usually consists of just being a mouth to spout pointless dialogue)? Being honest, I can't remember the name of the main character of the last movie I watched two days ago. In The Devil's Rejects, however, the characters are truly memorable. Every actor working in the movie plays their character realistically and gives him/her, well . . . character. None of them are stupid, and none of them are a cliché.The shootout in the beginning of the film is simply breathtaking. Why can't half the shootouts in movies be that good? People complain this movie had no buildup, but what is wrong with that? At this age of cinema, we already know how movies like this endbuildup just bores us. This isn't Alienwhere the suspense was essentialthis is a gritty horror movie that can deliver punches without the hour of pointless dialogue and suspense. Adding suspense to something like this is like trying to characterize a cliché characterit's unnecessary and just silly. I'm glad Rob Zombie gets that, because it seems like no one else industry does. There was not a word of dialogue spoken that didn't have some significance to the overall effect, and that is something that truly needs to be praised.Technical details, like the soundtrack and the directing, are all stellar. Once again, it's been a long time I've seen music used right in a film. None of that boring classical crap that just makes me laugh. I mean, someone's getting their tongue cut and Bach is blaring in the background. I just find that retarded. Zombie, however, understands how to choose music that fits the mood of the scene, thank God.The bad The huge, glaring problem that keeps me from writing a positive review of this film is there is no plot. It's sad to see such an amazingly done movie just dull because there is literally NO plot. You just watch The Devil's Rejects (the characters, not the movie) run from place to place and that is really it. Nothing happens. Yes, the characters are amazing, the music rules, and the action is excellentNOTHING happens. I wanted so bad to really like this movie, but that fact killed the entire movie for me.The gore really is nothing special. Everyone is talking about how brutal and sick this movie is, but, sorry, it isn't that graphic or extreme. At all. It earns its R-rating, unlike the majority of films, but calling it hardcore gore isn't exactly true. The gore takes up maybe 10 minutes of the screen time, and that's all. When it happens there is zero intensity, and zero brutality. The gore is pretty generic.Overall: this is a horror movie that really deserves to be watched. It's so much better than most of the crap out there, even though I really wasn't that impressed with it. It is not a rip-off of anything. It's just a well-made movie with great characters . . . and no plot.3/10",The Devil's Rejects
117,mcjensen-05924,Pathetic & Dull,3,3 February 2021,First off I loved House of 1000 Corpses. It was fresh innovative and had humor. While sadistic it entertained. Excellent music too. But this? Oh my....after the first 15 minutes I knew I was in for a slog. Ridiculous shootout where no police thought to actually follow them as they left. Really. A stupid religious component by the sheriff that was ludicrous as well as annoying. Inane dialogue F this F you F that. Just really got old and seemed pointlessly overdone. Nudity for nudity's sake. It was trying to be depraved but was just shallow and laughably awful. No character was worth 2 cents in this. Cinematography and editing was apparently an afterthought that got forgotten completely. I wanted everyone to die fast so I could move on. No such luck. Bad by any standards even the B sexploitation movies of the 70's had more value. Captain Spaulding was great in House cuz we only saw him briefly. Too much of him here. Way too much. Definitely not a 1 but certainly not a 5. I rounded down from 3.5.,The Devil's Rejects

119,happyendingrocks,"The crowning achievement of a semi-brilliant grindhouse auteur, or a snuff film for misogynistic misanthropes? Actually, a bit of both.",8,27 October 2009,"Rob Zombie has been given major praise in certain circles for being ""brilliant"", but watching this film, which is purported to be his defining artistic statement, I see an abundance of Quentin Tarantino homages and grindhouse clichés. Zombie has also been pegged as one of the driving forces of modern horror, but you can readily pigeonhole this film as an expanded look at the concepts set forth decades ago in Texas Chainsaw Massacre as viewed through the semi-satirical lens of Natural Born Killers. In fact, there isn't a single shock element in this film that isn't merely an inflation of ideas better essayed in the classic horror films that directly inspire Zombie's work.The writing here is wretched, and The Devil's Rejects contains some of the most laughably atrocious dialogue I've ever heard in a film. This is important to note, because the stark atmosphere and gritty violence sell this piece as a hyper-realistic look into the lives of reprehensible characters that we're sure must exist somewhere in the world, but hope we never meet. However, some of the absurd lines they deliver are a definite distraction from this sense of authenticity, and while the words must have looked cool to Zombie when he put them on the page, when we hear them said out loud, we're assuredly reminded that no one in the world really talks like this. This phenomenon extends both to our murderous centerpieces (who insert f-bombs every third word or so, ostensibly to remind us that these are bad people, so they swear a lot) and the lawmen who pursue them; particularly Sheriff Wydell, who gargles tough-guy clichés every chance he gets and displays a bloodthirsty bravado that belies the character's status as a peace officer in a thoroughly deserted territory that we can't imagine provides much opportunity for a cop to develop the wisened badass persona Wydell exhibits, or much opportunity to even issue a speeding citation, for that matter.My biggest complaint about Zombie's work is his use of sadistic sexual violence to sell the point that his characters are evil incarnate, but then presenting these characters in a manner that unabashedly strives to make us root for them. Borrowing another trick from Natural Born Killers, our Rejects are pursued by a nemesis as unscrupulous as they are, but Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding are by far more charismatic than the ultimately pathetic Sheriff Wydell, so they become our protagonists by default. There are no ""good guys"" in The Devil's Rejects, and we don't really have time to root for the hapless Country-Western group who have the misfortune of encountering our motley ""heroes"" at a deserted motel, since they're only in the film long enough to be systematically humiliated and slaughtered.What Otis does to one woman in that motel is horrendous and hard to watch, and when the end result is her being added to the body count without pathos or purpose, this cruel and nasty bit of mayhem comes across as beyond gratuitous. Since we already knew long before this point exactly how incomprehensibly depraved Otis and company are, all this scene does is toss in a bit of titillating misogynistic violence to appease the neanderthals who equate ""horror"" with ""torture porn"".I'm definitely not against rooting for the bad guys, but the way Zombie offers us his murderous characters as demigods is dismissive of the fact that, at their root, they're really a pack of white-trash animals who offer nothing resembling humanity for us to identify with. Even their tenuous family bond seems superficial, and the Rejects often act like they despise each other as much as they loathe the discarded victims in their wake. Their final glory ride into a hail of police bullets is clearly meant to martyr them in the name of cinematic iconography, but since by this point we're pretty much numb to seeing them as anything but mad dogs begging to be put down, this becomes an anti-climax of sorts.By now, you're probably guessing that I must have given this thing a 8 by mistake, since I have yet to say anything good about it. But, as disjointed and utterly unlikeable as many of the elements in The Devil's Rejects are, I'll be damned if Zombie doesn't still pull his grand scheme off. Despite everything working against it, this is an often-exhilarating love letter to the horror genre, and there are many things Zombie does here to suggest that his legions of admirers might not have him pegged all wrong.Most of the violence here is unglamorous, wholly ruthless and realistic, which certainly helps sustain the almost documentary-style vibe Zombie seems to be going for. The music is incredible, with selections expertly chosen to heighten the impact of the film, instead of to promote Zombie's dreadfully monotonous solo records. The casting is a dream, with luminaries like Sid Haig, Bill Mosely, Ken Foree, and Michael Berryman having loads of gory fun. And, even as stilted as the dialogue is, there's no denying the intensity of the performances from Haig, Mosely, and Sheri Moon Zombie, all of whom bring their characters to vivid life. Even the arty indie-film flourishes that dominate the presentation serve the movie well, since the horror genre is relatively untested in this mode. By borrowing so many of his tricks from other genres, Zombie ends up with a rare horror film that looks like no horror film you've ever seen. Despite its glaring flaws, the film certainly captures Zombie's bleak and uncompromising vision, and despite the obvious nods to its fore-bearers, The Devil's Rejects is a wholly individual piece of work. For that reason alone, every horror fan should see it at least once.Sometimes art is grim, unsettling, and ugly; but that doesn't mean that it's not art.",The Devil's Rejects
120,rparham,Not an easy Reject,6,17 January 2006,"The Devil's Rejects presents an interesting conundrum, one that many other films have done in the past: am I reviewing the movie or the moral message behind it. Well, in the case of this film, make that the amoral message. Rob Zombie's second stab at directing (pun partially intended) is, visually, gorgeous and at the same time, perverse at it's core. As one who has seen quite a few horror movies in my time, The Devil's Rejects oozes the atmosphere and style of the mid-70s horror, and also, revenge pictures, so I feel I must give Zombie his cinematic due, while questioning the man behind the camera also.To say that The Devil's Rejects roots for the bad guys is a bit of an oversimplification. There are no ""good"" guys in The Devil's Rejects. Everyone has some serious moral and ethical flaw, and I don't mean cheating on their taxes. The film is a semi-sequel to Zombie's dead on arrival first picture, House of 1000 Corpses, with a completely different take and feel to the material. It opens on a rural farmhouse where the murderous Firefly clan reside: Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sherri Zombie), Tiny (Matthew McGrory), and Momma (Leslie Easterbrook). The local Sheriff Wydell, portrayed by the great character actor William Forsythe, has arrived to take the family into custody, but a shootout ensues and Baby and Otis escape while Momma falls into police custody. It turns out that Sheriff Wydell's brother was murdered by the family, and he wants revenge. Otis and Baby hook-up with their father, the rather disgusting Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) who appears to be perennially in need of a shower. Make that multiple showers. They terrorize a family of country singers in a motel while planning to head for safety with Spaulding's brother Charlie (Ken Foree, of the original Dawn of the Dead fame).Zombie has made a perfect homage to the 1970's films he obviously has a deep affection for. Unlike House of 1000 Corpses, which looked just like a modern movie, The Devil's Rejects looks like it was shot in the desert in the 1970's. It has the wind-swept, sun-blown look of such films as the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Badlands and countless others. You can feel the heat and taste the dirt in your mouth while watching the movie. Zombie and cinematographer Phil Parmet have utilized the right old style film stocks and lighting conditions to make the years melt away between the now and the then. Zombie doesn't just stop at the visuals, though. The film channels the above mentioned films in crafting it's plot and scenarios. Instead of a gruesome horror film, The Devil's Rejects actually more resembles a gruesome road/revenge picture, the kind of vigilante films that Clint Eastwood made popular to some point, along with the Walking Tall films that screamed out for vigilante justice, much to the shock and dismay of many onlookers who questioned whether this was something that should be advocated. Yes, Sheriff Wydell has the law on his side in his hunt for the Firefly family, but he far exceeds his authority with his actions as the film progresses.You also cannot overlook the fact that the Firefly clan is viewed with a sympathetic eye. They are the focus of the picture, and they are the ultimate anti-heroes. They are sick, depraved, indifferent to the value of human life (other than their own) and willing to kill anything or anybody that get's in their way. And yet, Zombie sets them up as the individuals we are supposed to be supporting and, essentially, rooting for as the film progresses. Is Zombie's moral compass broken? Does he even have one? House of 1000 Corpses gave us some thin, one-dimensional innocent characters to attempt to latch onto. Nothing of the sort here, at least not as prominent. Zombie has his heart firmly attached to the killers, while casting the Sheriff hunting them in a evil light. It's easy to just dismiss the film outright and claim moral outrage, but the fact is that Zombie has crafted a rather decent-looking film here, one that pulls no punches in attempting to emulate what Zombie obviously adores.At the same time, this film does seem to suggest that all Zombie's work is strictly homage. There isn't really anything original here, and while it is expertly crafted, it is still a reference to something that has come before. Does he have a vision of his own, or at least a spin on material he has seen before that is somewhat fresh? The Devil's Rejects does a remarkable job of assembling a time capsule of a film from a particular era, but is it merely imitation, or is it truly art? If I sound conflicted about this film, I am. Some can easily dismiss it, and I am sure many will, and perhaps they are right. Maybe I am too wrapped up in style that I ignore substance? It wouldn't be the first time pretty pictures have covered a vapid core. But I think that, even as an exercise in self-congratulation and wish fulfillment on Zombie's part, he has put forward something worth looking at, as long as you can check your morality at the door for two hours. And I wouldn't blame you if you can't.",The Devil's Rejects
121,MJB784,Overrated,5,21 May 2018,"I didn't think Devil's Rejects was particularly scary. It felt more like an action movie. Most of the violence was guns, but the story felt repetitive since it was just about the family murdering people. It didn't have a goal or anything to it except the cops tracking them down. We don't get to know the victims very well. Also, who was the burned victim that rescued them in the climax? I also couldn't tell if parts of it were funny. It seemed so redundant. I thought it was intended as a horror movie since its considered scary by many. It reminded me of Natural Born Killers. It seems less scary to tell the story from the villian's point of view since he has no real goal. He's just evil.",The Devil's Rejects

123,isantistao,A Masterpiece. One of The Best Films Of All Time!,10,22 November 2019,"I didn't really like House of 1,000 Corpses. It wasn't too bad. But it was certainly lacking. I almost didn't watch this sequel. People said it was bad. But Ebert And Roeper gave it 2 thumbs up. So I knew it had to be worth seeing.And wow, what a work of art. A masterpiece. Just based on the film work and directing alone, this is one of the best done films of all time.Now while the last one relied mainly on the set, and horror elements to impress you. This one is all in the art of filming. The camera work. The directing and editing. The acting. The cinematography. Everything about this film is pure art.The beauty of this film is that Rob had lost a lot of money with the last film since it wasn't very good. He had spent a lot on building that impressive set. And didn't make it back. So this one is a very low budget film. The most expensive thing he could afford were the costumes. They had to get creative with the sets. And use smaller hand held cameras. And find smaller character actors, who could play some specific parts really well.This allowed for them to create a really rustic western like look for the movie because they actually found a ghost town to film it in. And the cameras they used allowed for crafty handy work with shooting. And the actors though small actors carried great performances in their specific characters that they play so well.And it is actually edited and produced to be made to look like a movie from the 60's or 70's, which is a very charming and fun thing to do that really makes it feel like you are viewing the movie back in those times, when the events it portrays occurred. And it is all scored with an incredible soundtrack of southern classic rock which makes it even more charming, and is an ironic contrast to the intensity of the film but they use it so as to make it fun and inspiring.And while this film does have some very intense violence, including sequences of torture and even sexual assault...and while it is gratuitous violence, it is done in such a way that it just is part of the art of the film. It allows for a intense adrenaline rush and peak experience, especially with how great the actors do in making it dramatic (which they have a lot of fun doing I heard).And this movie is more than just a slasher film that is done very well. In addition to being aesthetically artistic, they added in some deeper more meaningful elements. You see, there is a play on the concept of morality, and the duality of Good vs Evil beneath the surface. For there is a sherif that is very cowboy like and a bit of a vigilante that goes after the family of murders. And he does so in the name of both his dead brother, and God, for he is a devout christian. And it would seem that he is obviously good and the family of serial killers is evil.However as the movie plays out, using the art of film the director, Rob Zombie, romanticizes the family, making you empathize with them just enough...and the Sherif, driven by vengeance and revenge, crosses over the line from being absolutely good and on the moral high ground, to acting like a corrupt cop on the wrong side of the law, becoming like the people he is hunting in order to bring them to his own brand of justice by subjecting them to the types of tortures they have committed against others, which most people would agree is not morally right. So who is right and who is wrong? This movie plays so well with moral relativity and the ironic paradox that good and evil can be.And by the end of the movie you will have totally fallen in love with the family...the family of murderers, and not want them to get killed. You'll find yourself caring for them as they floor you with their stellar performances, and the equal film making skills to drive this story home. It is incredible storytelling with a strong beginning, middle and end, with a huge story arc and powerful climactic end. This movie will blow your mind and leave you floored thinking to yourself...""wow, holy!""And Rob Zombie makes a great statement with this movie, artistically and otherwise. And some of the scenes in this movie are just the most compelling, most artfully done scenes I have ever seen. The camera work in this film should be tought in film schools. I always find myself thinking of them from time to time. If you are a film connoisseur, you have absolutely got to see this movie. Ten stars isn't hardly enough, I'd give it an 11 if I could. This movie ought to go down in history as one of the greats alongside the other great movies of all time in its its genre such as the original Scarface (1932), Sin City, The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, Dracula, etc.For any film buffs and connoisseurs and people who are really into film and can see and truly appreciate the different artistic elements that go into a film, this one is a must see. You will enjoy it very much, to say the least.",The Devil's Rejects
124,lotus_chief,Maybe the worst film ever made....,1,15 February 2009,"I don't know why I even bother continuing watching Rob Zombie films. After ""Halloween"" and this drivel, this will be the last one. I was only drawn to the former because I'm a fan of Michael Myers. A terrible waste of time this movie is. The fact that Zombie is allowed to make movies and actually have them see the light of day says a lot about Hollywood. Completely tasteless, ""Natural Born Killers""-wannabe that serves absolutely no purpose to anything. Violent for the sake of being violent isn't thrilling or scary...its sick. William Forsythe must've really needed the money. Two hours of my life I will never get back; I'm actually worse off as a person for sitting through this trash. Mind you, its still playing as I write this...which goes to show you just how entertained I am with this sorry excuse for a movie.

125,DustinRahksi,A horrible experience.,2,31 December 2012,"I'm going to come right out and say, Rob Zombie should stop making films, because he obviously doesn't know how to do horror right. Horror is supposed to be suspenseful and terrifying, while he did succeed in making disgusting and disturbing characters he failed to make anything worthwhile. If you like rape, torture, nudity, violence and all these other things Zombie cares for, you will like this film. But if you are not like Rob Zombie, you will hate it, why?, because your not disturbed. Through the whole film I felt angry and wanted the cop to capture this family. But in the end their punishment was not severe, call me twisted, but it was unsatisfying. Maybe it's because I can't enjoy his films or I just don't want to understand the message of this film, but I doubt there is one. I love horror with all my heart, but this isn't horror, it's just a sick film.",The Devil's Rejects
126,Rathko,Contemporary Grindhouse Cinema at its Best,8,1 August 2005,"This is an excellent movie. Finally, a director who not only loves Grindhouse cinema, but understands it, has created an homage to the genre without once crossing the line into parody. From the blood red title graphics to the slow motion and freeze framing, the searing Texas summer to the trailer trash wardrobe, the movie is saturated with a genuine affection for seventies cinema, rather than the bell bottomed, Just-17 stylings of recent 70's efforts like the Texas Chainsaw remake. It's worth the cost of admission just to see a horror film with no teenagers in it! More importantly, and even more surprising, is Zombie's thorough understanding of the motivation, psychology and political underpinnings of 70's Grindhouse. The genre is very much a product of its era. In an America in which the government is lying, the police are corrupt, the national guard are shooting students, and the president is authorizing illegal forays into foreign countries, the lines between good and bad, moral and immoral, legal and illegal, become more than a little blurred. Grindhouse cinema was a reaction against, and a mirror held up to, a society where nobody could be trusted and loyalties were always suspect. In this genre there is no good and bad, and the psycho killers become the anti-heroes for the very reason that they are standing up to authority and refusing to play by the rules of a corrupt system. Zombie perfectly captures the forever-relevant cynical nihilism of Grindhouse. In the Firefly family, he creates a strange hybrid of the Manson Family meets the Leatherface clan via Gilligan's Island, and places them in a perfectly contained and insular world in which, for all their sociopathic cruelty, they become folk heroes of an apocalyptic social landscape of rusted trailers, abandoned motels, disease ridden brothels and desolate highways.Zombie's thorough understanding and appreciation of the genre, stealing scenes and moods from a dozen predecessors, allows him to create moments of true originality whilst never straying from his origins. Beautifully lit and photographed, with a great soundtrack and standout performances from the entire cast, make for a movie that deserves far more attention and respect than it will ever get, and takes us one step closer to recapturing the spirit of the golden age of American horror.",The Devil's Rejects
127,LanceBrave,"They Might Be a Despicable Brood, but They're His Despicable Brood",9,11 November 2013,"Horror and mainstream critics have an odd relationship, especially during the horror revival of the early-to-mid 2000s. Roger Ebert notoriously trashed ""Wolf Lake"" but gave ""The Devil's Rejects"" one of the most begrudgingly positive reviews I've ever read. Despite coming right in the middle of the moral panic over ""torture porn,"" ""The Devil's Rejects"" was embraced by a number of critics, even a few who, like Mr. Ebert, normally hate horror movies.Why did ""The Devil's Rejects"" crawl to the top of the pack, even though it's unapologetically vulgar, punishingly brutal, and focused almost exclusively on torture? There's a couple of reason. This film possesses a clear aesthetic. Just as George Lucas built a fully-formed world out of his love for 1950s sci-fi, Rob Zombie has built a cleanly defined universe out of a life-long obsession with 1970 exploitation films and white trash culture. ""House of 1000 Corpses"" was a psychedelic trip into a nightmarish netherverse made of the same ingredients but this film is far more disciplined. Everything is designed to reflect on the characters and their lives, from the trash and blood strewn homes, down to the roadside motels and pot-lamp whore houses. While he lapses several times into Shaky-Cam-Ville, CGI-Blood-Burg, and Industrial Music Score City, if the film reel was scratched up and ran through a projector, ""The Devil's Rejects"" would feel like an authentic, if particularly brutal, 1970s low-budget flick.It's fairly easy to read into the movie. Some writers see a metaphor about 9/11 and the War on Terror here. I don't know if that was on Zombie's mind or not but there is a brain under the grime. Sheriff Wydell, played with laser-point intensity by William Forsythe, quickly steps over the boundaries of reasonable police work in his quest for revenge. I've never been sure if the moral switcharoo the movie performs was wholly intentional. The Fireflies are pure monsters and the extended sequence of sadistic torture of the Sullivan and Banjo Band exist primarily to remind us of that. However, once Wydell captures the killers, he puts them through a no-less cruel torture-a-thon. The sequence finishes with a slasher-style stalk-and-slash. Sheri Moon, formally a cackling murderess, is now the quivering, crying final girl, at the mercy of an axe wielding mad man. This movie brilliantly has the audience repulsed by characters one minute and cheering for them the next.The reason I'm unsure of all of this is I don't think Zombie is, like Hitchcock, intentionally trying to get us to relate to sadistic killers out of a perverse sense of humor. He's making a point about the all-consuming fire of revenge but he doesn't think violence or revenge is bad. The real reason we relate to the Fireflies is because Rob Zombie loves them and wants you to love them too.And that's the real reason I think critics and horror fans alike loved ""The Devil's Rejects."" Its characters are fascinating. Zombie has made it clear over the course of his five films that he relates to serial killers, freaks, madman, and weirdos far more then he does to normal human beings. (Why else do you think he made Michael Myers the main character in the ""Halloween"" remake?) Unlike in ""House,"" he never bothers to introduce normal people into the fray, at least not as anything but meat-sack victims. The most endearing scenes don't revolve around the characters doing much of anything. An argument about ice cream, a fiery debate about Groucho Marx, the politics of running a brothel or chicken/human relations, discussing life on the road over a plate of coke, these moments don't advance the plot. But they do reveal our cast as human beings with thoughts and opinions. The unendingly profane dialogue is hugely over-the-top but frequently hilarious and quotable. Yeah, Otis, Baby, and Captain Spalding brutally torture, murder, and rape people. That's just what they do, man. They're free birds, as the perfect retro-redneck-rock soundtrack reminds us.It doesn't hurt that the cast is totally game. Bill Moseley gives the best performance of his career, grounding his usual frenzied insanity without undermining it. Sid Haig provided the comic relief in ""House"" but is revealed to be a proud, protective father. His best moment comes when he tries force their torturer to focus on him, instead of his daughter. Sheri Moon Zombie is actually a better actress then she gets credit for. At the very least, she expands pass the shrill manicness of ""House of 1000 Corpses."" Ken Foree, Michael Berryman, EG Daily, Danny Trejo, and even Diamond Dallas Page vomit up the vitriolic dialogue with energy and conviction. The only performance that doesn't work for me is ""Police Academy"" graduate Leslie Easterbrook, taking over for Karen Black. She cackles, screams, and goes way over-the-top. I guess that fits the tone of the material but it says a lot that she comes off like a cartoon character even in this exaggerated world. And a moment of silence for the late Matthew McGrory. He endows Tiny, the comparatively gentle giant of the group, with a quiet dignity, even under all that make-up. Without saying a world, you know how much he loves his family. They might be a despicable brood, but they're his despicable brood.The ending shouldn't work. The characters flashing back to happier times, frolicking together in a field, set to the strainingly earnest chords of Skynard, should be nothing less but ridiculous. Yet it's so sincere. It's exactly as stirring and heart-breaking as it should be. Enough gushing. ""The Devil's Rejects"" has aged fantastically. It's a signature piece of work.",The Devil's Rejects
128,lagriff05,"Revolutionary, one of the best horror movies of the century",9,16 June 2007,"(written October 2006)What a movie. This is Rob Zombie's second effort, after the so-so little flick House of 1,000 Corpses (2003), and it completely and totally smokes every other mediocre horror movie to come out in 2005 (or this year, 2006, for that matter). People can compare it to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but this is a film of it's own. It's not polished or glossy at all, it's straight-up, dirty, mean, gritty, and in your face. This movie is not for the weak of heart, and most people will complain about all the cursing, blood, and vulgarity in here...but hey, who cares? This is a horror fan's horror movie, and anyone who's open minded with a strong stomach and a taste for horror films will be very rewarded by this little gem.It's the tale of three sadistic, deranged backwoods lunatics, the only escaping members of the Firefly family after a police raid, who go on a little 'road trip' leaving a bloody trail of carnage in their wake. Chasing after them is sheriff George Wydell, who's brother was killed by the Fireflies in the first film. Wydell, on his hunt, spirals further and further downward into insanity, becoming the same as the people he hates so very much.This is, at heart, an revenge story, and a rather ironic one at that. George Wydell becomes the same kind of sadistic monster as the Fireflies, believing he's doing 'an act of God' by killing them. The Firefly family is brutal and cruel, yet they are undoubtedly a family, with a bond that makes you sit back and think for a moment. Who should you be rooting for? Should you be feeling sorry for the Fireflies when Wydell has them, or should you be shaking your head and saying that they got what they deserved? I suppose it's up to the individual viewer to decide. The family bond between the Fireflies is both maddening and touching. Maddening in the aspect that you know you shouldn't be feeling sorry for them or hoping they make it out okay, but you seem to have to do so anyway. Touching, in that they seem like very real people at times of the film. Excellent.The acting is extremely well done here. Sid Haig and Bill Moseley steal the show as Captain Spaulding and Otis respectively. William Forsythe does an admirable job as the vengeful hunter Wydell. And as a backbone, Ken Foree puts on a great show as Spaulding's brother Charlie. It's rare to see such great acting in a movie like this, but it's just icing on the cake here.This movie is very violent and brutal. Realistic, as well, there is no gore for show here. All of this is gritty, realistic horror, and Rob Zombie excelled at incorporating these elements into the film. He's really a brilliant director, as this is how every horror movie should look. None of this weak crap that gets passed around nowadays as scary, no, this is the real deal. No PG-13 junk or modern 'boo' type scares, this hearkens back to the days of Texas Chainsaw Massacre directing-wise, very dirty and mean. This movie wants to scare the life out of you, and it'll do everything in it's power to do so. They don't make em like this anymore.The soundtrack was amazing. All of the songs were enjoyable country/classic rock tunes that fit the 'western/outback' setting, and fit the individual scenes they were in quite well. For some reason it was even more chilling to watch these maniacs slaughtering everyone to old western tunes, giving the movie some extra effect. Lynyrd Skynard's ""Free Bird"" at the end scene was brilliant. Two thumbs up on the soundtrack too.The only drawbacks I can see is that a few scenes are VERY brutal and sickening, and thus casual horror fans and fans of other genres will find little to enjoy here. It's not a film for everyone, and some scenes may turn off quite a few people out there watching and expecting something less violent. But, that just makes it better for those who do like it. Like I stated earlier, this is a horror fan's horror movie, and it excels as that. Highly recommended to fans of real horror films. Rob Zombie is going places if he keeps this up.",The Devil's Rejects
129,Beyondtherain,Not into satanist or devil worshipping but this is a good look into reality,8,11 April 2020,"I'm more of a Holy God lover, I like some Gospel here and there, but this film simply shows you how sick people in the world are.

This stuff is REALLY happening and has for many many many years...I'm grateful movies can sometimes depict exactly what reality is...there's a little bit of comedy in here but no too much to take away from the reality factor.

It's even better when he finally removes the clown makeup and gets serious. Great scene. Bill Mosley is great as Otis Driftwood. Otis is even more sadistic than ever here. William F. makes a fantastic performance as Sheriff Rydel. The soundtrack is perfect and Zombie even added character development! Awesome! This movie can really get shocking at times and that's something I have hardly ever seen in the movies. The final showdown is one of the most twisted and powerful scenes ever!

132,TheRadiobox,An unnecessary improvement,3,7 August 2020,"The Devil's Rejects was directed and written by Rob Zombie, and stars Sid Haig, Sheri Moon Zombie, Bill Moseley, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Matthew McGrory, Geoffrey Lewis, Leslie Easterbrook, and Danny Trejo. It follows the Firefly family as they try to escape a police force searching for vengeance from the events of the first movie.The plot: Zombie's story is nasty by design. After a standoff with the police, including sheriff Wydell (Forsythe) for their murders from the first movie and prior, the Firefly family; consisting of Spaulding, Baby, Otis, and Tiny (Haig, Zombie, Moseley, and McGrory), are now on the run. Mother Firefly (Easterbrook) is arrested, and Otis and Baby escape. After their car is shown on TV, they ditch it and run into Roy (Lewis) and Gloria, who they hold hostage for no reason other than to pad the runtime. Spaulding meets the others and they hide in a brothel owned by Charlie (Foree) a friend of Spaulding. Wydell and his men eventually find the brothel and have another standoff which ends up getting the Fireflys captured. They then have a confrontation with Wydell.The characters: Characters are more mixed this time around. While they have personalities, only some are well written. Spaulding is great, having at least some semblance of thought and reasoning while still being a complete loon. Otis is horrible, but that is the point. He makes some good jokes and does the same things as the others in the family. Baby is the same as Otis but is female and gets endless shots for the camera. Wydell is a solid protagonist, having an affinity for Elvis and an unrelenting quest for righteous revenge. Performances are equally 50/50, with Haig and Moseley being captivating and hilarious in nearly every scene they're in. Zombie is awful, sure she looks good, but she somehow manages to both under and overact. She tries hard to show some presence but still ends up falling leagues short of her costars. Forsythe is great, his gravelly voice, commanding demeanor, and perfect amount of craziness making him more reserved than the Fireflys, but still on edge. Everyone else gives weak performances in a movie that so desperately needed lively ones.The horror: Scares never arrive in the movie. After the first movie used so many moments of pure shock value to attempt to scare the viewer, the second outing for the Firefly family relies on the same stuff from the first one, although there are a couple good scenes of intimidation from Otis and Spaulding, but nothing that makes the rest of the non-scares worth it. Scenes involving Roy, Gloria, Wendy, and Adam all go on for far too long, as is standard in a Rob Zombie movie. His indulgence into his gore and nudity filled mind never adds anything to the scares, it only makes the movie seem unnecessarily long and flat. Some thrills are pointed more towards the direction of the Firefly family; trying to send a bit of sympathy from the audience their way with music cues, dramatic setups, and scared shots of Baby. It sends a lot of mixed messages and zero thrills.The technics: Technically the movie is all over the place. Editing is sometimes in homage to grindhouse movies of the 70's and other times modern. Pacing is terrible, with around 15 minutes being spent in the motel with the people Baby and Otis held captive, which adds literally nothing to the story. Equally unnecessary and boring is the scene early in the movie where Charlie talks to one of his girls, and another where he buys some chickens. At least 20 minutes could be removed with zero consequence; there is nothing special about the torture scenes, hostages, or gore. Music is placed sporadically throughout the movie, shattering what little modicums of suspense exist by pure happenstance with tracks that are definitely emblematic of the 70's but add nothing to the experience.Rob Zombie made an earnest attempt at a movie with The Devil's Rejects, but cannot write or direct an interesting story, and several of the actors give terrible performances; most notably in his wife, Sheri. Despite some good lines and scenes and conviction from Haig, Moseley, and Forsythe; the movie becomes yet another failure from a hack director.32/100",The Devil's Rejects
133,schroeder-gustavo,Way better and darker than I expected,7,13 June 2015,"After watching House of 1000 Corpses last night, I wasn't expecting much more from this Rob Zombie sequel. But it is definitely an improvement and an actual GOOD movie. The film takes place immediately after the events of the first one, although you could watch the movie without having seen the first and after the cops surround the house of the crazy family of the first film, a series of gruesome, dark and bloody events unfolds. Like the first one, this film does a great job in paying homage to exploitation films of the 70's and the story and the characters aren't superficial this time around, and you actually care for them. Zombie has actually accomplished something that is extremely difficult: by the end of this movie, even after all you've seen them do, after realizing what terrible people they are, you end up cheering for the bad guys. I do think the movie is flawed in a way that Zombie only seems to presents us with his darkest thoughts, but still isn't able to make a great movie by getting these ideas together in a structured and sound manner. I also don't like the whole subplot about the sheriff who is chasing them: if the movie focused ONLY on the devil's rejects like it is supposed to, this would have been a lot better. Sheri Moon Zombie is not only gorgeous but she shows that she is talented as well in this one. The Devil's rejects is a very dark, gruesome but fun movie that I enjoyed and was a good surprise, although some things could have been different in my opinion. The ending to this movie and what it accomplishes leads me to believe that Rob Zombie has it in him to be a great filmmaker.",The Devil's Rejects

The tension runs high throughout. What an action thriller! Can you tell I liked it yet? It's a shame that movies like this will never win awards & such as it's truly a work of art. Though it's most definitely not for the faint of heart. This movie is about as dark, sadistic and gruesome as they come, and I loved every minute of it Everyone in the cast was great and there were no short comers as far as I saw. I really don't know what else there is to say. If you like hardcore action / thriller / gore movies then this buds for you! If you are turned off by sadistic behavior or easily squeamish, then best pass. I give this movie a 10 for its seemingly realism yet dark nature and attention to detail. You can tell everyone wanted to make this movie work and it paid off as it's a beautiful piece of work, no doubtOnly other thing, if you haven't seen the first one (house of 1000 Corpses), then i do recommend seeing that one first. You certainly don't need to as this movie stands on its own, but as a direct prequel, it will give you some character development and insight that certainly helps add to the second movie.

137,w00f,The Passion of the Zombie  A Step in the Wrong Direction,3,22 July 2005,"I liked House of 1000 Corpses. Granted, it was an unpolished first attempt by a new filmmaker, but it had flourishes and homages that showed Rob Zombie to be a devotee of twisted horror camp. Sure, it was brutal... but H1KC had a sense of fun to it. I figured that after the experience of making that film, Zombie would learn a great deal, and his next film would be better.I'm sorry to say that ""The Devil's Rejects"" has proved me wrong. This is a truly inferior movie. It was thin on everything, and the first scene practically gave away the ending. Everything about it was clumsy, and there wasn't a thing in this movie that hasn't been done better many times before. It COMPLETELY lacked the campy fun of H1KC.Frankly, this movie played out like Rob Zombie's answer to ""The Passion of the Christ."" For the most part, this is two hours of up-close shots of brutal torture. Any character in the film that is capable of eliciting even a little sympathy is murdered right before our eyes. Zombie attempts to turn a trio of murderous psychopaths into heroes. He somehow expects us to feel something for a bunch of people who butcher innocent victims. Tracking the butchers is an equally sadistic and psychopathic local sheriff. In short, there's nothing to latch onto in the film... no good characters, no fun, nothing but torture and bullet wounds.Are we supposed to feel sorry for poor Otis Firefly when he gets crucified by the sadistic sheriff? WHY? We've seen him do worse many times over in both the first movie and this sequel. Are we supposed to see the murdering trio as heroic during the films clumsy climax, which Zombie appears to have lifted straight out of films such as ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde""? Why is it necessary to play ALL of Lynard Skynard's ""Freebird"" for the slow-motion carnage? We're not allowed to hold up our lighters in the theater after all.This movie is nothing but a step in the wrong direction for Rob Zombie. I can't express anything but disappointment.

139,spacemonkey_fg,Vastly Superior to House of a Thosand Corpses,7,11 August 2005,"Title: The Devils Rejects Director: Rob Zombie Cast: Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, Sheri Moon, Ken Foree, Danny Trejo, Review: In 2003 Rob Zombie decided to make his directorial debut with a horror film known as House of a 1000 Corpses. When released the film was torn apart by critics everywhere and dismissed as utter garbage, but the horror fans, they knew and they embraced this film with opened arms and welcomed it into the anals of horror as a worthy addition in the crazy family/slasher sub-genre. Enter The Devils Rejects Rob Zombies second chance to show the world that he wasn't some hack, that he was no joke and that he is a force to be reckoned with as far as making horror movies goes. Did he succeed? Heck yes! The story is simple. It starts off right where the first one left off with the cops rading the Firefly home and hunting the out. Otis Driftwood, Baby and Capt. Spaulding all go on the run, running away from the cops and leaving a trail of bloody bodies on their way. One of the cops on the hunt for the family is a guy who is out for revenge since his brother was killed by the Firefly gang on the first film and he is willing to go to tremendous lengths to exact the bloody type of revenge that he wants.The similarities between this film storyline and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part II are very evident. Heck, it doesn't surprise me since Zombie has said many times that Tobe Hooper is one of his greatest influences. But Rejects goes its own way despite the fact that it wears its influences on its sleeves.The simplicity in the story allows for the film to dive deep into long scenes of psychological and physical torture. Though this movie is not as bloody as you might expect from Rob Zombie, you will be surprised to see that most of the physical violence is off camera and implied and that Rob Zombies main focus is to actually make you feel uneasy and uncomfortable in your theater seat. Things get ugly and Zombie pushes the envelope on what you can actually withstand from a visual and psychological stand point. In other words, this movie is not for the squeamish, so be warned.Tarantino and Zombie can be mentioned in the same sentence since its fairly obvious that they are both from the same planet. The are both infatuated with the 70s. And its very evident in every single aspect of this film, from the clothes, the cars to the soundtrack and the pop cultural references. If you can believe it, there's a sequence where Star Wars is mentioned and there's even a whole section about Elvis and his greatness, now if that isn't as Tarantino as you get, I don't know what is.Not only that, the film looks and feels like it could have actually been shot in the seventies. Its got that gritty dirty look, there's no hip young flavor of the month teenagers anywhere to be seen and the movie is almost devoid of flashy slick colors. Its got a sort of bleached out look that gives the film an unglossed feel that just adds another level to the realism that zombie was obviously shooting for.This film is vastly superior to House of a 1000 Corpses in many many ways. In tone, the film is a heck of a lot more serious, the characters ain't cartoony horror clichés, these bastards feel like they could be real villains out there in the real world. Kind of like the same feeling I got when I first saw Wes Cravens The Last House on the Left. Even the dialog is smarter. At times I felt that these were almost different characters since they were so much smarter and not the bumbling idiots they were on the first film. Here Otis is one mean SOB, and Spaulding is even more menacing without his clown make up on. He also gets some of the best lines in the film.And finally, the coolest part of this film is that it made me feel sympathy for the devil so to speak. Somehow, you know that the Firefly gang is a mean spirited bunch of killers, murderers and madmen, yet somehow they pale in comparison when that vengeful cop comes along. You almost feel sorry for these guys when you know whats coming to them. And suddenly, the bad guys are the good guys...and vice versa. So my hats off to Zombie for taking this original route.In conclusion, I recommend this film for those with huge tolerance for uncomfortable movie moments and to those horror loving freaks out there. Everybody else need not apply..unless you got some balls.Rating: 5 out of 5",The Devil's Rejects

141,scobbah,It just get better and better,7,18 March 2006,"First, this one is a sequel to ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" and you should see that one before ""The Devil's Rejects"" (later referred to as TDR).So I wasn't that impressed by the first piece, but what I liked about it was the evident touch of Rob Zombie. After seeing this one, I'd say that it just gets better. Rob's personality in his style is more evident, and, if possible, more developed. The psycho violence goes on and TDR is at least two or maybe three gears above its forerunner judging all factors. I would go as far as saying Rob's got quite his own style and this one may be an instant cult classic, spellbinding its viewers with its awesome mix between violence, sex, drugs and rock'n'roll (cliché now?).",The Devil's Rejects
142,guyfromjerzee,Very impressive film by Rob Zombie,8,21 December 2005,"I was especially impressed after being disappointed by Zombie's debut film, ""House of 1000 Corpses."" That movie, though certainly not horrible, contains much evidence of a first-time director. In ""The Devil's Rejects,"" Zombie proves that he's not just some dumb musician who should stick with his day job. He really does display some genuine talent as a writer and filmmaker, as I was deeply engaged from start to finish. And what's greater is that he pulls no punches. This isn't some glossed-over PG-13 horror flick where good triumphs over evil. Throughout the course of the film, you're on a wild, unpredictable ride, as you really don't who will survive or will be bludgeoned to death in the next couple minutes. Let's face it, that's life. Evil people go on to lead happy, extensive lives, while the good die young. There are quite a few truly suspenseful and disturbing moments, where you really feel the characters' terror. Zombie also did a fine job at casting, as many of the actors are topnotch. Veteran character actor William Forsythe gives the best performance as the righteous sheriff, who slowly goes insane. He fully immerses himself in the character, and helps add even more validity to the film. And there's the great Sid Haig, who stole the show in ""1000 Corpses"" as the same character, the demented clown by the name of Captain Spaulding. To top it off, the soundtrack is excellent. How can you possibly hate a film that uses Lynyrd Skynrd's ""Freebird"" for its dramatic conclusion? Even if you, like me, were disappointed by ""1000 Corpses,"" please give this film a shot. After watching ""The Devil's Rejects,"" I look forward to Zombie's next film--if he does, in fact, choose to go on directing.",The Devil's Rejects

An instant cult classic, Zombie does it yet again.",8,25 July 2005,"Sid Haig, Bill Mosely, Sheri Moon, William Forsythe, Ken Foree, Matthew McGrory, Leslie Easterbrook, Danny Trejo. Written and Directed by Rob Zombie.A sequel to the repulsive House of 1,000 corpses where a family of in-breed maniacs lure unsuspecting people in and raise some serious hell. Now that the cops have caught up to them they must make a run for it and go on a killing spree (Rob Zombie style). Now Otis (Moseley), Baby (Moon), and Captain Spaulding (Haig) run from the law and fight back the only way they know how to and that's none stop killing. Zombie makes a great effort at a weak story line of a family of maniacs also done by Wes Craven in the Hills Have Eyes, Zombie most likely knowing that offered a star of the movie a part in his film whom he co-stars with Ken Foree playing Charlie the pimp. A good sequel better than the first (even though I did like it but it could have been a lot better)and much much bloodier and gorier. SO wrong in SO many ways.

144,broadfoot,As if HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES wasn't horrible enough,1,10 December 2010,"I remember Rob Zombie's band White Zombie were extremely popular when I was in high school. When the band broke up and Rob decided to pursue a directing career, it seems only appropriate because the band's music and image was inspired by horror movies.I went to see Rob's directing debut, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, just out of curiosity. Boy, did I make a big mistake. It was one of the most repulsive pieces of garbage I ever saw! So why did I see THE DEVIL'S REJECTS? I guess my head wasn't on straight. It was just as repulsive as its predecessor. The only good part of it was when William Forsythe captures those creeps and proceeds to torture them slowly, driving nails into their hands and hitting them repeatedly across the face with his gun butt.Please, God, let this be the last time we see Captain Spaulding on the big screen.",The Devil's Rejects
145,mrush,Rob Zombie finally gets it right,7,5 March 2006,"After the lousy ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" I didn't think I'd ever see another Rob Zombie film.""1,000"" wasn't anything but a blatant rip off of Tobe Hooper.""Rejects"" is simply a movie in which we follow a bunch of degenerate dope eating family members around and watch them torture and kill while a cop ,whose brother they killed, tries to hone in on them.Nothing fancy but it works quite well as a movie.Lots of blood and gore and all the other stuff you'd expect from a movie like this.Great soundtrack but not one that stifles the on screen action.Ken Foree is even in this film but thankfully Zombie doesn't use his presence to rip off Romero.Sid Haig is nothing short of great.His character,Captain Spaulding, is a wonderful mix of a jolly perverted clown and Ed Gein,that threatens to boil over at any second.The only fault I see with this film was the insistence of Zombie to show his wife's butt at least 20 times in the movie,clothed ,partially naked,naked,close-up naked-he shows it every way.OK Rob we get it---your wife is hot and she has a nice can,nice not extraordinary.I got nothing against a good butt but butt and gore don't exactly mix well for me.So Rob please don't do that in Part 3.This film ,while not great or legendary,is a fun gory trip that goes a long way in redeeming Rob Zombie as a director.",The Devil's Rejects

Other than that, I like how it's set in 1970's and it has that vibe to it. I remember a girl said this movie was scary. But it never scared me. I'm laughing. Am I a serial killer? It's mostly gross, but has very funny moments. Especially the clown threatening the little boy. Lol.",The Devil's Rejects

But when the farm in which the family lived is found by police, the family is narrowed to three: Baby(Sheri Moon), Otis(Bill Mosely) and Captain Spaulding. They make their run as fugitives and kill a a group of five on the way. But one of the cops as a huge motivation. The Devil's rejects killed his brother and his revenge will lead him to obsession.This movie is most brutal movie I have ever seen. The audience experiences every bit of the murders, not letting the mind imagine anything on its own. It's very original, which is extremely rare in horror pictures today. The movie embraces the murder scenes almost as works of art, something which can be related to Seven or Saw.The character development is something I noticed to be awkward but well done. The three of the killers all show a since of emotion and normality to each other as a family which is actually kind of funny. Overall, the movie is well done horror movie (if you have the stomach to stand the intense brutality).I recommend this movie.",The Devil's Rejects
148,MacAindrais,"Gruesome, disturbing, enthralling: Very good thriller with the potential to have been a great movie in general.",7,19 November 2005,"The Devil's Rejects: ***The Devil's Rejects was definitely a step up from its prequel, 'House of 1000 Corpses.' I saw 'Corpses' sometime ago and it stuck in my mind not because it was a good film, persay, but because I wondered afterward ""what is going on inside Rob Zombies head?"" 'Rejects' was also very disturbing, and featured that same ""oh my god"" quality. Not as deranged as the first, it was more serious and you can see how much Zombie has matured. Some great cinematography and some excellent camera tricks that even though frequent, were not overbearing. The movie gives a more human face to the deranged killers which is not something you usually get. Zombie condemns, yet sympathizes with these characters at the same time. Do such people deserve sympathy? We're all human, and we all deserve some sort of understanding, and to see this portrayed even for such revolting people was interesting.'Rejects' was attention grabbing, exciting, and disturbingly fun throughout. Now, some minor flaws. I knew that 'Captain Spalding' was named after a Groucho Marx character and the connections with the other names. This was an interesting part that didn't need to be explained so thoroughly. The Elvis Presly conversation/debate was rather unnecessary as well. The ending was pretty good, BUT I felt that it would have been more effective if the sheriff had of finished his reactionary revenge of torture. This would have gave a great ending to the film: you would see a terrible painful end for these horrible people, but it would have been still ironic enough to show the hypocrisy of the sheriff's actions. In my humble opinion this would have made a better, and completely unexpected ending. I was just waiting for something to pop out of nowhere to stop him and, of course, it did. All in all, 'The Devil's Rejects' was a very good film surpassing most of the thriller/horror movies I've seen in a long time. I just wish Zombie would have taken the low road and avoided what we all knew was coming and continued with what we wanted but never expected to happen (we expect things like this to happen, good to conquer evil in such a glorious way we just can't think that it will come true. Zombie could have made it true, and approvingly shocked us all. Even though Spalding and his deranged family are destroyed in the end it wasn't near as satisfying as it could have been.)7.5/10",The Devil's Rejects
149,Ky-D,A solid sequel.,8,16 August 2005,"Rob Zombie loves drive-in horror. His two films to date show an affection for all the things that made those movies great. But where as his first feature 'House of a 1000 Corpses' took an early 70's psychedelic stance on the genre, his second feature takes a brutally realistic, late 70's view.Some time has passed since the Firefly family brutally ended the lives of those four unfortunate youths in the first film and the police have caught onto them. The brother of the sheriff killed in the first film leads the violent assault on the homestead that leaves several cops dead and the family on the run. While the brother decides that the law just isn't tough enough for this task, the family seems unfazed by their near escape and go about their brutal ways. With both sides having murder on the mind, how will it conclude? Zombie seems to be refining his style in this feature. While the first was good, it still suffered from a kind of trippy, music video style that worked at the time, but now seems overdone. The follow up is more concrete in the manner in which the film unfolds and the artsy tricks employed this time around enhance the narrative.Most all the surviving actors return from the first film (with the notable exception of 'Momma', previously played by Karen Black) and most all seem more sure of the characters they are playing. Sid Haig is especially delightful as the less wacky, more creepy Captain Spaulding. Among the new actors William Forsythe turns out to be a great addition (it's so fun watching him lose touch with reality and turn into the thing he hates) and look for a slew of genre actors from Ken 'Dawn of the Dead' Foree to Danny 'From Dusk till Dawn' Trejo.Aside from the revamped visual style, the biggest change in the film is a large narrative lapse. What the hell ever happened to Doctor Satan? How about the freaky hammer-dude? Or what about grand-pa? Just an observation.All in all, Zombie has put together one of the best of the recent crop of horror films, far exceeding what has become the current standard. Some of the violence is pretty brutal and is occasionally hard to sit through, but that is the point in the end.Rough around the edges in the the right ways, a must for horror fans.9/10",The Devil's Rejects
150,MairegChernet,one of the worst i've ever seen,1,19 June 2011,"Nowadays, It takes something extraordinary for me to write one of these reviews and this movie is extraordinarily bad! So here goes. I feel like Rob Zombie was confused as to what he is supposed to do with this movie. There are so many things that were wrong with this movie. I don't even know where to begin. First of, what the hell is this movie about? There's no definitive or structured plot. It starts off as cops chase bad guys type of scenario but it quickly spirals into this lazy and bland piece of crap. The plot was dumb and could have been better... a lot better. And the actors were so unconvincing and unfit for their roles. They just looked like they wanted to get it over with and go back to whatever they do when they're not making terrible movies. The characters were so annoying half the time and just awkward the other half. The characters in the nude scenes were probably the only appealing aspect of these otherwise bunch of unattractive people. The tall guy with the long hair looks like Jim caviezel in the passion of the Christ and he was not scary or threatening at all. He just looked like he was depressed or something. That fat clown guy needs to see a dentist quickly and as scary as clowns can be, this guy was just laughable. And the girl, apart from being extra attractive, did not look like she belonged in a family of killers.Other than the annoying characters, the movie was filled with way too many subplots, unnecessary melodrama and excessive blood and gore. I can go on and on. But it's not worth it. Please don't ever watch this movie. It's flat out one of the dumbest things ever. They say you'll appreciate this movie more if you watch house of a thousand corpses first; but I say avoid both or any other terrible Rob Zombie movie... which is like all of them.",The Devil's Rejects

153,GreyHunter,Finally rewatched it for the first time since it came out...,4,18 October 2019,"...and can now articulate why I didn't love it nearly as much as so many others have. It reads -- especially toward and at the end -- like a 16 year old's idea of awesome transgressive re-imagining of the usual rules of good and evil. You can almost hear Rob Zombie getting excited: ""Hey, what if we humanize the evil psychotic monsters and...oh, and make the good guy just as evil as them because...um...oh! because he gazed into the abyss or something and it destroyed his decency or, you know, something like that? The world will be shocked and proclaim me a genius!""Sad to say, nothing about the movie was either insightful or original. Which is fine, generally -- it's hard to find an new idea after some 7000 years of civilization. But if you can't be overly insightful or original, you need to deliver the ideas in a way that compensates for this. Unfortunately, this movie just slams us over the head with them. No subtlety or style to it, which is why, as I said above, you can imagine Rob Zombie getting all excited...but not getting smart about the ideas.The whole ""villain tries to kill by setting something in motion rather than killing straight up (really, why not start the fire at their feet?)"" was only marginally better than the whole ""villain lets person run so he can hunt her, only to have the tables turned on him"" plot device, but, worse, the timing just accentuated the banality of the ideas being shoved down our throats.I honestly believe Zombie's ""Halloween"" was far superior to this movie. Granted, I don't hate his ""Halloween"" (don't love it either, but certainly don't hate it like so many other horror fans seem to.) ""Halloween"" at least gave us real nuance in the characterization and themes. Not a lot, but certainly more than ""The Devil's Rejects.""",The Devil's Rejects
154,polysicsarebest,A trainwreck,2,24 July 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is a horrible, horrible film. No, not horrible in the sense that the imagery is disturbing or violent; it isn't nearly as much as has been hyped. It's horrible because it's just straight-up disappointing and a huge waste of time.First of all, House of 1000 Corpses is a film I initially had some problems with. The flashy editing techniques and stuff distracted from the story, which really didn't go anywhere at all. However, the more I watched it, the more I put my mind to rest on most of that stuff (despite it eventually turning into a mess at the end of the film, which I will never forgive). It is and always will be one of the craziest and most easy-to-re-watch ""horror"" movies ever, with style to burn, humor, trash and chaos. I dunno why people refer to it as a music video or whatever people want to insult it with; the film is just a straight-up exciting and fun watch. It's nu-horror, but it's an example of a good film in the post-Scream world.Devil's Rejects, on the other hand, is just bad bad bad. Zombie took all the good elements of House and didn't apply them to this film at all. I might as well get my praises for the film out of the way immediately: The directing is competent, there's a certain throat-slitting scene that is well-done, Captain Spaulding was pretty funny, the music was fitting, and the film wasn't another ""teens-get-lost-in-the-woods"" kind of flick that has recently reemerged... but, yeah, that's pretty much all I can say about it.The film was just completely straight-up retarded. The ending is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. They tried everything they could do to make the film disturbing, to the point where they should have just thrown a big red flashing sign above the movie theater that said ""BE DISTURBED BY THIS. THIS IS A DISTURBING FILM."", similar to one of those ""APPLAUSE NOW"" signs that they supposedly have at late-show tapings.I mean, you have a gun being stuck in a vagina. There is a face-wearing scene similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. There is some cocaine and ""Freebird"" being played for about 7 minutes of its 17 minute length as we see slow motion shots of gnatty hair. BE DISTURBED! It was just so laughably bad, hard to totally convey in words. Later in the film, they had a few interesting elements, like the Unholy Two (two bad dudes with muscles who violently.. uh.. CALL THE SHERIFF WITH INFORMATION!!) and the bad-cop-gets-revenge angle and all that, but those elements were never explored to a satisfying degree. The film was pretty much plot less and occasionally teetered on ""totally unwatchable"".I'm not going to tell you all not to see it, because there are certainly people out there who have never seen better films whose mind will be blown by this atrocity. But there isn't a whole lot to recommend here. The whole movie was about hiding in hotels, for crying out loud. And the whole ""this movie is disturbing!"", ""this movie is violent!"" thing got old really quickly. I can't recall a single violent aspect of this film except a few gunfights and the overlong torture scenes near the end. Yay. Bad film.",The Devil's Rejects

157,manicman84,great horror-road movie,9,11 August 2006,"Rob Zombie's ""Devil's rejects"" is far superior to his previous movie, ""The House Of 1000 Corpses"" which is a typical slasher flick, but has also some surprising moments. In ""Devil's rejects"" Zombie continues his story of psychopathic family fortunately retaining an extreme brutality which was a determinant of his previous movie. ""Devil's Rejects"" is an original combination of a slasher film and road movie keeping in suspense. The story is well constructed and quite unpredictable. Some scenes are extremely hilarious. Especially funny is a moment in which the sheriff tries to find out the origin of nicknames of antiheroes. It is an awesome parody of thrillers. The most amazing is a final scene - surprisingly magic and poetic. Zombie proved that he not only can shock viewers, but also surprise them. The film is obviously worthy of attention from every fan of not only horror movies, as such pictures don't occur frequently on a big screen.",The Devil's Rejects
158,ghoulieguru,See? Even Zombies Can Learn,6,20 January 2006,"The follow up to House of 1000 Corpses winds up being a superior movie to its predecessor. With his second outing as a director, Rob Zombie has definitely come into his own as a storyteller. The movie has style and an energy that brings to mind Sam Peckinpah and some of the maestros of violence from the 70's. Even if you don't generally go for serial killer movies, you might take something out of this movie watching experience.Now, I have to say that I found the first hour of this movie incredibly hard to watch, and I was about to turn it off. I started off hating the Devil's Rejects for all the reasons that I hated House of 1000 Corpses. At some point, these types of movies stop being horror films and become something akin to gore-driven porn. To me, there is a distinction between horror films and violent, gory exploitation films. In the simplest terms, I feel that a horror film should scare the viewer. I think we can all agree that causing a feeling of deep fear or dread is supposedly the intention of a horror film. With most serial killer movies, I can't say that I feel a moment of real fear. I feel like I'm watching a graphic, unrated version of the 11:00 news. Violent exploitation films like Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, or the Hills Have Eyes don't really terrify the audience, but merely glorify violence and seem to revel in the torture and rape of women. I haven't seen Eli Roth's Hostel yet, but I'm sure it's more of the same. If anything, it makes me wonder if maybe the directors of these films should invest in some therapy and save the rest of us from having to watch their excrement.Occasionally I watch one of these films, and it starts out like any other violent exploitation movie, but then takes a turn and becomes interesting. This is how I felt about the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Haute Tension. While both of those movies started out like a standard gore porno (gorno?!), they wound up being more complex than I had originally thought. That was the case with the Devil's Rejects.As I mentioned, the first part of the movie is difficult to watch, and it does seem like Rob Zombie is gleefully wallowing in the violence and depravity he's creating. In fact, he seems to take so much pleasure in how disgusting he can be that it made me question what Rob would do if anything bad ever really happened to him. I mean, this guy is a rock star. How bad could his life be? I'd be willing to bet that if a serial killer got a hold of his wife or his child, that he wouldn't think this kind of thing was so entertaining. Regardless, the movie was shot with a lot of style and had a soundtrack that would make Quentin Tarantino proud. The music is eerily appropriate throughout and adds a powerful counterpoint to the violence you're viewing on screen. So, even though I wasn't enjoying the first hour of the movie and I thought it was basically a porno movie, I had to give Rob points for crafting a really glossy porno. But still, I was getting ready to turn it off...Now, I don't want to give away anything for those of you who haven't seen it, but I will say this: with the Devil's Rejects, the end justifies the means. While I hated Rob Zombie for dragging me through an hour of depravity and seemingly pointless violence, I loved him all the more for the way he twisted around my concept of good guys and bad guys. By the end of the movie, I was fully engrossed and I found myself having all kinds of strange feelings about the three remaining members of the Firefly clan and the Sheriff who hunted them down. As much as I hate to admit it, I don't think that the ending of the movie would have been nearly as powerful without the violent and disturbing build up of the first hour. End analysis: After House of 1000 Corpses, I thought this retired rocker was just a zombie, both in name and in intelligence. But I take it all back. I think this Zombie has a brain. This is not the work of some wanna-be bad boy who wants to be shocking. This is not an exercise in depravity with no real purpose. This is actually a well-crafted story by Rob Zombie, who apparently has something to say after all.",The Devil's Rejects

Really it was a little creepy in the beginning, while the characters are just being fleshed out (I didn't, nor will I, see the 1st movie)....But then it descends into a series of pointless events and weak ass musical interludes, and the 'plot' goes absolutely no where. The characters are phony, the dialog is execrable, and there really is very little action to speak of, either.If you're into films that glorify gratuitously violent morons, this is for you.This isn't intended for argument/discussion, just to keep others from wasting their time.",The Devil's Rejects

162,badgrrlkane,I just love it when sequels are better than the originals.,8,27 July 2005,"This was so much better than the first film of the Firefly family. The first was way too campy & came off to much like he was trying to make both the first & second Texas Chainsaw Massacre films into the same film. But without the horror & intensity of the Tx Chsw, as Otis & Baby weren't at all scary as much as weird & Otis as funny. Though both Bill Mosely & Sheri Moon Zombie were both excellent in it. The Devil's Rejects is a much better film as it takes itself seriously when it needs to & is laugh out funny( if you have a twisted or sick sense of humor) in a lot of parts of the film. it made me laugh in a lot of parts so loud i was almost embarrassed as it was during scenes when i probably shouldn't have been laughing ( namely the scenes in the hotel room & when otis bashes the cowboy's brains in & then tears off the other's face). And this movie was like a B-Film lover's ultimate experience. Thank you Mr Zombie, for finally giving the great Ken Foree a great role & double thank you for adding some of my favorite cult actors & actresses in the movie such as Mary Wornov ( she's always great?,P.J.

Daily,Geoffey Lewis & Priscilla Barnes( as they were awesome together). my only gripe about this film is why didn't you bring back the truly awesome Karen Black as Mother Firefly? When I first heard it was Lleslie Easterbrook, I have to say I was very disappointed as her previous rise to some-what fame on Laverne & Shirley & in the Police Academy movies doesn't make her sound like she would've been a decent predecessor to the mighty Karen Black ( who was truly legendary in the old 70-'s tele-flick Trilogy of Terror) but I have to say she was pretty f?@!*5 awesome as Mother Firefly. Great re-invention of a film whose characters in the 1st film could've been a lot better had their been a better storyline. This is like the ultimate combo of a road-action-chase 'em flick & a homage to the Manson family, w/h a little bit of Texas Chsw Massacre still thrown in.I loved it! This movie,Land OF The Dead, & High Tension were all great representations of why horror needs to go back to be rated R, a hard R that is. No more PG-13 horror! **** out of *****",The Devil's Rejects

Now I know why.This is a gore movie, plain and simple.If you love movies that just give you gore throughout, not much plot and very little good acting, then you'll love this movie.This movie is about a bunch of morons (played by bad actors) who's sole purpose in life is to kill other people in sick serial killer ways. There's only one good actor in the movie, you'll know him when you see him.I do watch a lot of gory horror movies, and I especially like zombie movies even if they do suck bad. This movie is just blood and guts all the way through just for the sake of blood and guts. At least the zombies want brains, these guys just want to kill for no reason other than it's in the script.Save your money and watch Dawn of the Dead or something classic. This movie doesn't cut it (although it does cut lots of other stuff). My main beef is the acting and lack of much of a plot. Sucks sucks sucks.",The Devil's Rejects

I have to say I was quite disappointed.The story was OK, but it felt like it had no meaning and the same things were happening through out the film.Still had the same actors for the villains and did a good job. Still awesome filming by Rob Zombie again.The ending I just thought the whole thing really didn't lead anywhere and didn't have any point, had an awesome song at the end, Freebird by Lynrd Skynrd.Overall, quite disappointed and nowhere near as good as the first.",The Devil's Rejects

It's an exciting road trip movie with plenty of violence and psychotic yet sympathetic characters. A stand out horror movie. Zombie's films are largely forgettable but not this one.

Its okay, but I don't find the quality here that I experienced with the first. That is, at least in part, due to how really great the first one was. It was next to impossible to match, much less top. Devil's Rejects? Sound track, okay. Photography, good. Continuity, very well done. Acting, falls a little short in spots when compared to the first. Plot, falls way short by comparison. Did I see a set up for yet another flick to come? A ""House of 3000 Corpses""? Yes, I know how it, #2, ends. No, I'm not going to spoil it for you. But a Number Three? Oh, you bet. And if I'm weird enough to key into it, well, I'm betting Zombie planned it that way. Is this flick worth watching? Oh yea. Its a history lesson, developing the characters further. In that respect its VERY good. And if you saw and liked the first one this one is worth watching just to see if you can spot what I saw. If Zombie decides to go for it. Yup, Number Three.",The Devil's Rejects
167,tpaladino,You'll never look at 'Freebird' the same way again...,9,20 December 2006,"I was not expecting much from this movie other than an entertaining way to spend two hours. What I got was much, much more.I did like 'Corpses' for what it was, and thought it was a very fun 70's type campy horror flick, and sort of expected this to be similar. Boy was I wrong.Rob Zombie created a real masterpiece with this film. It is brilliant in every way it needs to be, and doesn't try to be any more than that. The plot, screen writing, casting, locations, acting and most of all, the soundtrack and cinematography are all dead-on. I can't really think of much that could improve it overall.I also watched the DVD bonus material, which has a lot of very insightful commentary from Rob Zombie and other cast members, which added another level to my enjoyment. Its clear from these interviews that this movie was no fluke; Zombie is a master filmmaker, with a clear vision and enough skill to properly execute it.If you're a fan, buy the DVD and watch the bonuses.",The Devil's Rejects
168,kellyadmirer,Awesomely Depraved,7,28 July 2008,"This film definitely is not for everyone. If you are the least bit squeamish or not in the mood for some rockin' aggression and sheer depravity, look elsewhere.OK, now that we've winnowed the audience down to those who really want some blood and guts, let me just say that this film is sheer trashy fun. You have it all here, the classic gang of lawless white-trash cut-throats living by their own rules on a kind of extended road trip, police chasing them who are worse in almost every way than the murderers they are chasing, and loads of innocent and not-so-innocent victims who meet their ends in a variety of bizarre ways.So, we have a redneck band on the run - two guys and a hot chick - who engage in acts of depravity that look like they could have come straight out of a Stephen King novel. I don't know what else you need to know, either you like that kind of movie or you don't. Director Rob Zombie does a great job at giving some insight into the characters and doesn't pull any punches. There isn't a lot of sex, mostly it's just violence and humiliation at every turn. And this film stands on its own, you need not have seen Zombie's ""House of 1000 Corpses"" in which some of the characters were introduced to enjoy this outing.Sheri Moon Zombie is the best thing in the film, exuding trashy self-centeredness in all of her scenes. But practically everybody gives an outstanding performance, starting with Sid Haig - the scene where he asks a kid a very funny question while stealing a car is classic - and continuing with the wonderful William Forsythe as a demented Elvis Presley fan and the always underrated Geoffrey Lewis, who has to have some very odd statements to him repeated because he can't quite believe his ears. I want to specially mention uncredited Robert Trebor, who some may remember from ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,"" for his off-the-wall monologue on, well, you have to see the movie.Riding down the highway in a convertible nursing wounds from the last gunfight, Freebird blaring, guns at the ready, trouble ahead - what a great scene. Great scene. Lock and load, baby. Fabulous movie if you like ones that let it all hang out.",The Devil's Rejects
169,Ryu_Darkwood,"Its predecessor was just bad, this one is bad in a good way!",7,8 July 2007,"Its predecessor '' The house of thousand corpses '' had its moments but overall felt as a crappy attempt to make a low-budget horror flick. Rob Zombie certainly learned from it because this sequel is far better. Like Tarantino's recent ''Deathproof'' this movie feels as a colorful homage to the grind house films of 20/30 years ago. It doesn't take itself too serious by telling a completely over-the-top story out of the perspective of a dysfunctional family of serial killers. The soundtrack is brilliant with its '70's folk rock and country, adding up to the ambiance of the southern America during the seventies. I thoroughly enjoyed the wickedly funny jokes in which ''civillised'' Americans discuss the meaning of the killings by the family.Overall; this is a great movie to watch half drunk on the couch with a group of friends!",The Devil's Rejects

171,timothyhilditch,Adult movie written by a child,2,24 September 2021,This movie is a mess. Script is terrible feels childish nothing is planned out ahead in advance and anything that is can be seen a mile off. The story threads and editing are the first try. Nothing intelligent can be taken from this script.The protagonists are serial killers making some scenes violent crimes or sexual assaults with no purpose to the plot or tension in the scenes. The only people who would enjoy these scenes are just sickos.Some actors were terrible having conversations for minutes which have no relation to the plot only to be killed off in 2 seconds to be never mentioned again. Half the movie could be cut without losing any meaning. Even with the scenes we do have characters just show up randomly or just act dumb.,The Devil's Rejects
172,Guardia,"""Devil's Rejects"", READ: ""Hollywood's Rejects""",2,17 November 2005,"Frustrating and tiresome film about a family of killers turned fugitives. For those who saw 'House of 1000 Corpses', and want more of the same, then stay away - you won't even get that much. What we have here is simultaneously boring and over-complex series of events that test the viewers patience continuously.I must say, the start of the film excited me - with the simplified good versus evil setup. However, as soon as the movie 'developed' it's 'plot', I began to get restless. The director is continuously trying to convince us that his characters are quite psychotic, and we believe him - to a point. Their incessant rantings and continuous taunting of their victims only wears the viewer out, and each subsequent micro-scene loses impact by half. They become less and less convincing simply by their repetitive behavior.Also, I'm aware of the similarities between a certain scene in the hotel room, and a certain scene in a hotel room in Lynch's 'Wild at Heart'. Tsk tsk tsk.The plot was not too enjoyable, (we never really get a sense of purpose or motive), and the characters are slightly unusual, (however very hollow and inconsistent). I guess the film looks quite good, and I can't help but imagine what would a Resident Evil film would look like if Rob Zombie directed it (but keep him away from the screenplay!). His mechanical plot devices are probably OK for TV, but I paid A$14 for this, and I'm pretty peeved about it.",The Devil's Rejects

We ended up watching it three times, which is probably the best entertainment dollar I have ever spent! While the content of this film is definitely disturbing, what was even more unsettling was experiencing the character development of the bad guys.Zombie has done a very crafty job of putting a human face on some of the most horrible people you could ever meet. Regaurdless of their crimes and sick fantasies, these same people harbor likes and dislikes and even have a sense of humor through it all. This is something I had never experienced before and probably won't for a while again.The final shoot-out of the movie smacks of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and will even get you feeling sorry for the murdering scum at the end! I was amazed.This movie is worth your time!",The Devil's Rejects
175,jmerlino,Gleefully dark,7,1 December 2020,"I was interested that some of the reviewers here are annoyed that Rob Zombie went for a darker tone here than in House of 1000 Corpses. I thought there was just as much humor, albeit humor with a darker edge. How can you not laugh about an evil clown having a nightmare about being shot for calling a hoor a hoor, or at Baby and Spaulding childishly taunting Otis for Ice Cream?Zombie's true genius, I think, is in his characters, and how he's cast them. At this point, can anyone imagine someone other than Sid Haig playing Captain Spaulding? I doubt it. And Sherri Moon Zombie's Baby Firefly is pretty much a horror icon at this point. Bill Moseley is some kind of demented cross between Gregg Allman and Charles Manson. These three characters are unquestionably the most iconic horror movie baddies since Freddie Kruger, and all three fully inhabit their roles.Zombie also does a great job with the '70s vibe. The music is spot-on, and the whole thing just feels like it could have been made in the 70s, but without any obvious ""Hey, look, it's the 70s!"" moments (e.g. no shots of Carter on TV or anything)..Plot-wise, this is basically a road movie. It begins where ""House"" left off, with the Firefly clan on the run, and ends with a doomed assault on a massive police roadblock and a hail of bullets. It's not the most complicated plot, but it gives the characters room to do their thing.Some other reviewers have complained that the movie is needlessly nihilistic. It's true, all of the characters in this movie are horrible people. But have these reviewers seen any modern horror or even some dramatic movies? Zombie didn't invent the idea of anti-heroes. He's just mining the vein extremely well.I've said in other reviews that horror movies need to have a sense of fun for me to like them. The fun is all over this movie. It's in Sid Haig's every move and line. It's in Sherri Moon's gleeful demented amorality. It's in Bill Moseley's force-of-nature aggressiveness. And mostly it's in the whole feel of the film. Zombie obviously loves the films to which he's paying homage, and the whole film is sort of suffused with his enthusiasm. This is a film with energy, and joie de murder.So, I guess my advice to the people who hated this movie for its nihilism or whatever would be to either stop watching horror movies all together, or to dislodge the stick from your lower intestine, and have a little nasty fun.",The Devil's Rejects
176,DJ_Shilo,Hell doesn't want them,8,21 September 2018,"Rob Zombie returns to the characters that only could have come from a mind such as his: Dark, seedy and violent, ""The Devil's Rejects."" I never thought Rob Zombie would make a sequel to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" since it only made $16 million but here it is and it's just as violent and cruel as to be expected.It begins with a police assault on the farmhouse from ""House of 1000 Corpses"". Sheriff John Quincey Wydell (William Forsythe) is looking for revenge for the death of his brother and leads a search and destroy mission on the Firefly family. Two of the family members manage to escape from the assault, Baby (Sherri Moon Zombie) and her brother, Otis B. Driftwood (Bill Mosely). Needing a place to lay low, they end up at a run-down motel, Kahiki Palms, where they contact Baby's father, Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) in a last-ditch effort to outrun the sheriff's department and go out on one last killing spree.If you liked ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" you will like this picture. It's hyper-violent and a good example of the horror genre. If you like films that push the envelope and are borderline disgusting, this will entertain you. It's a big improvement over the original film but in many ways, it's different. The original was a straight style horror film and this one plays out like a road movie with all the bloody carnage intact.It opens with the sheriff department quietly moving on the house with every intention of destroying the family. Sheriff Wydell speaks through a bullhorn and alerts the family who quickly takes up defensive positions with some interesting homemade armor. One of the family members is not so lucky and another is captured, while two escape; the worst of the family would have been the ones to get away. They escape through a secret passage, into a sewer system and go on the run where the film begins in all its glory. Not before we're treated to the southern sound of ""Midnight Rider"" by ""The Allman Brothers Band"" during the opening title sequences.Normally a film like this I would not give any praise too but there is some good writing in it and some characters as well. They are supposed to be depraved and seedy and this is acted in high regard. They were originally portrayed as a murderous family and this picture tends to make them more anti-heroic in some ways. They believe they are doing the ""devil's work"" so they have a background to them and a motive. These are characters that we're supposed to dislike but for the life of me, I wanted to see what they were going to do next. If something like this works, it must be effective.After the characters escape the house, Otis and Baby descend on the run-down motel where they take a traveling band hostage. The second act plays out in this motel as they wait for the humorous and equally deranged, Captain Spaulding. This motel becomes a ""room-of-horrors"" as the two rejects subject the hostages to various forms of humiliation and depravity. This sounds crazy but not all the picture is disgusting and there is a humorous sense to it. The characters are humorous and don't even realize they are and they name themselves after Groucho Marx characters.Captain Spaulding is a well-written character and thankfully, he plays a bigger part in this film. He showed up at the beginning, middle and end of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and we discover in this, he is Baby's father. We sensed all along that he was one of the family and this picture confirms it. He has bad teeth, a bad attitude and is a disgusting person. He is the type of character that would shoot you square in the face or have people running away screaming while he laughs.When things start to calm down, they pick right back up again and get either gruesome or deranged. Some of the final sequences in the film involve a shock I didn't like and I didn't see it coming. Before this shock, the characters are tortured by Sheriff Wydell in the house where it all began. They are nailed to chairs and tortured using a staple gun and photos of the murder victims by Wydell. Like I said, gruesome.Some will like the picture and others will not. When I say it's not a film for everyone, it's not. It's hyper-violent and disturbing material will make some viewers cringe. Oh, I almost forgot the ""Roadkill"" sequence. If you can make it to this scene in the film you should be okay with the rest. Expect a major and disappointing surprise near the climax but for all intents and purposes, it ends as it should.",The Devil's Rejects

Bill Moseley is still a total badass as Otis driftwood, sid haig is still hilarious and messed up and crazy as our favorite foul mouthed clown captain Spaulding, the gorgeous Sheri moon zombie is still sexy and deadly as baby firefly, and William forsythe played what is honestly the most crazed and menacing sheriff I've ever seen. anyway, I highly recommend this badass movie to horror and action fans alike.",The Devil's Rejects

All of this to shock the viewer. To bad Rob forgot a key point to shock. You have to care about the people for you to be shocked by their death.

184,plpregent,"Sadistic, twisted, vile...and incredibly fun!",7,9 October 2019,"To be perfectly honest, I didn't really like House of 1,000 Corpses. I didn't hate it, but to me, it was not a standout horror flick by any stretch of the imagination. I thought the plot was pretty standard, the visuals were not overly appealing, the tone lacked the kind of humour that I was initially expecting, and the shock value and fancy gore that led the MPAA to force Rob Zombie to tone down the violence in order to obtain an R rating was nowhere to be found.A couple of years later, I see the trailer for The Devil's Rejects, and it's honestly one of the most intense trailers I've ever seen. So I decide to give the film a try and go see this at a nearby theater.The Devil's Rejects does not waste a single minute and jumps right into the action as the film begins. From the get-go, the cinematography looks very different from the previous outing, with a somewhat grainy picture, saturated yellows and washed out blues and reds that give the image a warm and dirty look. As an army of police men raids the lair of the infamous family of murderous degenerates, the character of Sheriff Wydell emerges as a threatening, religious zealot looking for revenge, and extreme violence erupts.From there, I knew that I'd be watching a completely different film, and probably a much better one than its predecessor. The look of the film alone will be a delight to everyone who's a fan of 70's horror/exploitation flicks. Clearly, Rob Zombie wanted to pay homage to a genre and a decade from which he obviously drew tons of inspiration. And it gives quite a special feel to the film throughout.The Devil's Rejects is one of these extreme ""good"" versus evil films pitting murderous criminals against an insane policeman, in a fashion that was somewhat reminiscent of French cult classic ""Dobermann"". It gets to a point where you wonder who's supposed to be in the ""good guys"" camp...and the answer is absolutely nobody. This is a film in which every character is fundamentally evil, and where any trace of good intentions or kindness gets sliced and diced or beaten to a bloody pulp. And honestly, it's so incredibly balls-to-the-wall and filled with the darkest humour that it's hilarious at times, if you can handle the violence. Captain Spaulding punching that woman and scaring away her kid before he steals her car had me rolling in laughter, so did that piece of dialogue coming out of Otis' mouth about the barrel of his pistol as he talks to two men he's about to recklessly execute.The cast is just plain great: Sid Haig is an absolute standout here, as Captain Spaulding, a sadistic clown who acts as the fatherly figure to the other two maniacs, Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), the latter of which offers quite an over-the-top performance, thereby successfully delivering an over-the-top character whose unpredictability is quite spooky. Bill Moseley has some great moments here too. The show-stealer, however, is William Forsythe, who plays Wydell, a bone-chilling sheriff looking to avenge the death of his brother (who was executed in House of a 1,000 Corpses). That man is by far the biggest maniac in the entire film, and that makes for quite a memorable ""villain"" among a palette of murderous maniacs. There are a number of secondary characters that are played by legends of horror cinema (Ken Foree from Dawn of the Dead, Michael Berryman from The Hills Have Eyes, etc.), which is a nice addition and adds yet another layer of homage to the horror genre and the 70's.Some scenes get pretty intense too, including many that involve Sheriff Wydell. I'm surprised that Zombie did not have to make a new cut for this film in order to obtain an R rating, as it's more violent and graphic than House of 1,000 Corpses by a landslide. But overall, and oddly enough, The Devil's Rejects is quite a fun time. The soundtrack features great tracks from the 70's that blend in perfectly, the characters are quite colourful, the dialogue is surprisingly sharp, Rob Zombie's direction is great and the film's look is flawless. On the downside, the story is a bit linear, the few plot twists were a bit predictable, and character development is pretty much nonexistent. But if you take it for what it is, and are among the target audience, you'll be in for quite a ride. As the trailer advertised it, it is a tale of revenge, madness and murder...and a mighty fun one!",The Devil's Rejects

186,abyoussef,"Bloody brilliant. The definitive film of the genre--Cheap, gory low-budget campy Serial Slashers",7,19 March 2007,"by Dane YoussefRob Zombie is without a doubt one of the most versatile and true-to-his-genre artists out there. ""The Devil's Rejects"" is the kind of movie uptight censors and worried parents always warned you was gonna get made some day.A movie where the leads are psychopathic murderers, the violence is excess and the gore is so voluminous, that you have to ask: ""Does this movie satirize this kind of sadism... or celebrate it? Is it a fun campy parody... or a sign that we may have gone too far with our ultra-violent-based entertainment?"" This movie actually defines the term ""overkill."" Three of the more interesting deranged killers from ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" get their own spin-off in the ""Frasier"" or ""Jeffersons"" tradition. The three, who are a family, actually (a father and his son and daughter) go on a mass killing spree and are racing out of the country to legal freedom on the other side of the border. They seem to echo the Manson Family.Their sense of humor is the kind of acquired taste like the movie itself has. It stems from the experience you'd get from... watching slasher movies throughout a lot of your life. Like lime green Jell-O, anchovies, fish eggs and black licorice, this is not for all tastes.The movie is actually a lot smarter and more complex than you might imagine, if you're unfamiliar with what Zombie's movies are about. It's akin to films like ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn,"" ""Vulgar,"" ""Desperado"" and ""Freaked."" If you like these types of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Friday the 13th"" re-vamping in the video-geek traditions, here is a movie you may hold up as one for the history books. The dialogue is written a twisted brilliant way and the direction has a real retro-'70's homey-quality to it. In a way that doesn't feel contrived.Sid Haig, Bill Moseley and Sheri Moon are all so perfectly demented in their roles, you have to wonder what they're like in real life. You pray they're nothing like they are here... and hope you never come across anyone remotely like this either.Sheri Moon, wife of director Zombie, looks more like a typical American model-actress than the degenerate rank-skank she plays here. Moseley is real-life, was actually a columnist and Heig often played scuzzy thugs, but played the judge in Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown.""I find it incredibly strange that some people seem to be COMPLAINING that the pursuing cop character (the sheriff, John Quincy Wydell) is as sadistic and mentally unbalanced as the family killers themselves. Why?Yes, he is. But... why?Why is that a bad thing? In any way at all? Look, if there's anything history and government have taught us, it's that it takes one to catch one. Not just in the movies, but in life. And not just in real life, but in movies as well. You see, it's not just an opinion. It's a fact. It's the way of the world.People... do we all not remember Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive""? His I-Will-Catch-him-By-Any-Means-Nessicary-Law Enforcer way was one of the true milestones in the movie, and it got him an Oscar. Would we want any of the other major characters to be far less interesting than the leads? When you eat a meal of any kind, you don't just want a rich main course and the side dishes to be as tasteless as styraphone. You want a whole meal you can taste.And the stuff with the sheriff and the rest of the cops IS something to see. Why? Because he isn't any kind of undeveloped character. Zombie made him (and everything else) just as big, broad, colorful and energetic as the '70's genre that this one stems from. There's some humor with the Kentucky-Fried Sheriff and the rest of his ""Good Ol' Boys"" in Blue. It goes without saying that in a small town, the cops are all red-necked. The way the stereotype of the small-town cop in a campy-slasher pic is handled with more laughs than usual. And there's a great moment where they call in a specialist, a film historian (see: uber film geek) to help them with the investigation and this film critic.... well, suffice to say, he insults the name of God in the house of the Lord and that's all I'm gonna say.We all know Zombie is a neo-talent outside of the music biz. He did the LSD effect in ""Beavis & Butthead Do America."" The end may justify the means, in this case. The hick cops and the colorful killers... in the end, it's an ending we all knew we deserved.Speaking of Zombie, his film debut ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" was a film I found to be embarrassingly bad. I'm a fan of those types of rock-horror camp movies in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""House Of Wax"" vein. SEVERED vein, in this case. But everything was played out so campy, so cheaply, so maudlin, so without suspense... that Zombie, I felt, made a movie that seems to be an insult, rather than a tribute to those horror-show camp classics. But he's redeemed himself with this one. He's working without a net and it all could have gone horribly, pathetically wrong. So I give him props. BIG, BIG PROPS.As I'm writing this now, he's currently re-making ""Halloween."" Though I wish he wouldn't, really. Why re-paint the Mona Lisa? Give it eyebrows, what? Will that REALLY be an improvement?Brace yourself. Not for all tastes. Procceed with caution. Use extreme care.NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED, SQUEAMISH, PRUDISH...

187,pandabat,It's Good to be Different,8,15 August 2005,"I'm not one for normally viewing this kind of movie. At least not in the cinema but I'd seen the trailer and must admit that I was intrigued. I actually expected something a little more unhinged and darker than what I got but this was no bad thing. At first, when I heard the dialogue, I thought ""Oh my God! What have I let myself in for?"" but a seconds later I realised that I was not to take any of this too seriously and really began to enjoy this. Yes, it is incredibly, relentlessly, sometime needlessly, explicitly violent and without the detachment that the unreality of something like ""Sin City"" provides. This gung-ho film-making. It's not perfect but it provided something that felt alternative to the normal releases that we get this time of year and best of all this romping killing spree is well accompanied by an outstanding soundtrack. There were times where I felt I had to grit my teeth just enough to get to the next scene but for those with a reasonably strong stomach, I heartily recommend checking this out. I don't think that I've seen anything quite like it!",The Devil's Rejects
188,CyMaddux,Not as good as it could have been,6,23 July 2005,"This movie is adequate, but it could have been much better. I have a few gripes about the movie, but first I want to give my opinion on some of the better points.William Forsythe was awesome as the sheriff. I don't think anyone else could have done better in portraying the inner struggle with vengeance and he was just gruff enough to put froth that image of a hard ass Texas sheriff.Sid Haig of course was decent, although not as good as in HOTC. It seemed like he didn't have as many lines and not near as many sarcastic scathing tongue-lashings like he did in HOTC either. You do get an interesting scene when he wakes up from a dream next to his... um... girlfriend lol.spoilers to follow:OK now what I didn't like. The stupidity in this movie is amazing. First off, you have sheriffs surrounding the house, getting into position and then the Sheriff simply pulls out the megaphone and announces their presence (expecting them to come out with hands up) and of course this leads to a firefight. Pretty lame indeed, not to mention the shoddy ""Knights of the Round Table"" armor that some of the family had on, which was pretty ridiculous; reminded me of the beast thing that chases around Marc Singer in the beastmaster.Anyway, after that, Baby and Otis escape, get a car only to STOP at a hotel to rest!! Otis is listening to the radio, hears their names all over the radio and decides to stop at the local hotel to rest.. umm OK but I would think you would try to get as FAR AS POSSIBLE from that town. But of course Rob Zombie had to have them come upon an old roadshow band and slaughter them (which also didn't have much creativity).Then you have the Sheriff (after he ties up and beats the hell out of Spaulding and Otis with a tazer/cattle prod type deal and stapler lol) light the house on fire after he douses it with gas, goes outside for at least 10 minutes, yet Otis and Spaulding get SAVED by Tiny who is at best a ripoff of freddy krueger on steroids.I was about to seriously take off a couple points for the ending, as the movie roars into Freebird by Skynard and you are lead to believe that the torrent trio got away scott-free only to meander on a road block with the rest of the sheriff's department. Luckily, for realism's sake they ARE NOT able to drive right through guys with 20 shotguns this time (Should have packed Galahad's armor) The music didn't do it for me either. It seemed to slow down the movie. Rob should have stuck more to his roots and used Metal to keep the pace Quick and Hard instead of twangy, slow and ""drugged""5.7/10 (mostly in part to Forsythe's great acting)Violence Meter ::::::: 7Nudity ::::: 5Language ::::::::: 9NOT FOR KIDS!!!!",The Devil's Rejects

Everyone in the cast comes thru in this film with stellar performances by Leslie Easterbrook and Bill Moseley in particular , Sherry is good too and Sid Haig turns in another solid effort .I like the way he puts in faces from the past too , Berryman etc .Sheriff Weidell kicked ass too , assembling the right cast was key here . He may have peaked with this effort , Zombie that is, but lets hope not . This horror film had a noir feel to it , the documentary style filming worked well , mostly because there where great performances to film .

190,Strider_1978,The discerning mind is rewarded,10,30 October 2009,"The wrong people are reviewing the right filmsThere are people that have reviewed this picture and branded it pornographic, brutal, depraved- etc etc. I would disagree with those individuals.As Rob Zombie quite rightly stated that there are far worse films to be viewed- if the desire arises. I would personally refer people to 'Irriversable' and 'Baise Moir'.The plot is very simple, I'll sum it up so I can cover the more significant points. Law enforcement infiltrate and penetrate the home of the Firefly family known as the infamous 'Devils Rejectes' (TDR). Mar Firefly is captured, another is killed and two escape. One murder during the credits ensures a stolen vehicle and a hole up in a motel. Hostages are taken and humiliation/murder/sexual molestation and nastiness ensue. Mar Firefly is interrogated by questionable means and the Sheriff goes on the trail of these odious no gooders. TDR meet up with the clown Captain Spaulding and TDR leave the motel with none alive and go to an associates residence for further assistance, and there they are captured through betrayal and the assistance of two mercs. Torture and murder leads to a finale that well and truly changes everything. There, it's as simple as that.So what makes this film stand out? Well that can only be explained by a viewing. It is not possible to convey what rewards the viewer on a journey into the lives of three degenerates. The beginning shootout gets us going, and then there is a lapse where we are not quite sure what the movie is asking of us. There are comedic moments and lots of trashy humour, lewd crude profane content that takes us down Tarantinos highway. The terrible power of the film is how TDR are given a form of humanity. Note I did not say crazy fruit cake killers or psychos. These individuals are not crazy, it is as though nastiness is simply part of their trade. Mrs. Zombie has lost a few screws but is far from crazy. You want crazy, watch the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is the music that is key. At no point did I feel any form of sympathy for the devil, save perhaps Captain Spaulding who has some serious personality, which pun intended goes a long way.The question we have to ask ourselves is where does the line end with ethics and morals. We see some truly odious deeds, but can those deeds be avenged and justified with further acts of vengeance? Here is where Zombie gets us. Where does good end and evil begin? What if *your* loved one or close friend/relative was tortured and killed, what would *you* do? Have *you* ever in your darkest thoughts considered inflicting pain and violence upon an individual you observed on the news for a murder or rape or wronged you? Who is now the monster? :)Everything that is shown, the content whether sexual or violent and profane or all of the above is done within a given context. The lives of TDR are not pretty. Zombie does not shy away from this, nor is he afraid to show us things that are going to offend. Real life is not pretty, and those of us that live in safety can be ignorant of this, but that will never change the darkness of human nature. I was inspired whilst watching this film. Funny eh? Not really when you consider that it made me ponder a trip to the local gun shop. I never want to own a fire arm, but neither do I want to be subjected to the tendencies of the degenerates that exist in society that relish in the pain and suffering of others. Food for thought?The finale of the film is worth the viewing. It can and will change the way we think about people and things. It will leave you, oh yes it will, thinking and thinking and thinking. I won't spoil it, just watch it and see.TDR needs to be viewed from start to finish before labeled or branded. Turn away from it prematurely and the vision is lost. After watching it, love it or hate it, much like Clockwork Orange you are left with a myriad of thoughts. No, it is certainly not for everyone, and this is a film I can only recommend to 'film fans' out there and not those looking for something to enjoy with a bucket of popcorn.Final thoughts- Rob Zombie directs unabashedly and without fear. This is not sesame street, nor is it tamed down for a teen audience. A must for the discerning palette.",The Devil's Rejects
191,Markmainwaring,The new and improved Tarantino!,9,18 February 2006,"To me Rob Zombie is fast becoming a new and improved Tarantino.This is mainly down to name checking and references in there films. Both even reference the same kinds of films from the same era.The difference is while Tarantino lets his films get that filled with references that, with Kill Bill especially, there is no real film there anymore. Rob Zombie can reference and keep his own personal style and make the film watchable.In the case of The Devils Rejects Rob Zombie as managed too make a funny, nasty and often disturbing road trip movie. This film is far superior to the underrated House of 1000 Corpses and hopefully his movie career like his music will go from strength to strength.",The Devil's Rejects

193,georgevader,The view according to www.georgevader.co.uk,6,6 December 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is Rob zombies follow up to 2003's rather silly, but nether-the-less, enjoyable schlock horror flick ""House Of 1000 Corpses"".Once again we join the rather unpleasant Firefly family, Otis, Baby Firefly, and baby's father, Captain Spaulding as they head out on a road trip of murder and torture hotly pursued by a vengeful cop.The film, like it's predecessor, apes Texas Chainsaw Massacre to the hilt, though this flick has quite a lot in common with TCM's first sequel, with the mad ass Cop and lashings of ultra-violence.The trouble is that, the most shocking aspect of the movie is that in between it's gratuitous violence, torture and sexual degradation the film is dare I say rather dull and pedestrian! There are moments of note, a classic scene involving a Juggernaut, the film's finale played out to a soundtrack of 'Freebird', the cast too is a cult movie fan's wet dream, Ken Foree (Dawn Of The Dead), Danny Trejo (From Dusk Till Dawn), William Forsyth (From Beyond) and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes) .The end product though is nothing memorable, there is only so much degradation you take in 100 minutes, and this film proved to be just too OTT to even a seasoned gore hound like myself.",The Devil's Rejects

The hit-and-run scene was done well enough I was cringing in my seat (and I don't often cringe at gore). I really did like this movie. But I almost can't recommend because it is so unspeakably vile and depraved. Rob Zombie shows us the absolute worst kind of human beings who kill with no moral conscience whatsoever, who revel in the blood and filth of death, and it is so unsettling (there ARE people out there just like this) and revolting you might wish a movie like this had never been made. Myself, I can't see any redeeming value to this movie - but some of the performances were good (not by Sherry Moon Zombie, though, who is a terrible actress) and it WAS entertaining and sometimes that's all I can ask for in a movie.",The Devil's Rejects

I am a customer of this slimy fraud so I must have somehow created it, in a roundabout way. I lust for bloody dementia just like the next well-adjusted guy. The bloody protagonists of this sad orgasm of sickness push the boundaries of propriety in a truly thrilling and lurid way.

This sequel does turn its head away from the supernatural elements introduced to us in house of 1000 corpses. Making this sequel more realistic! It's sad to know that people exist in this world who are very much like the firefly family...its also terrifying!

198,brainofj72,Zombie Redeems Himself,9,27 August 2005,"Let me start off by saying I was very, very disappointed with ""House of 1000 Corpses"". It was overly-fast-paced to the point where it seemed like the only people who could enjoy it were those with ADD. It was also suffering from a lack of gore and carnage, something rather surprising from the horror aficionado that Mr. Zombie is. On top of that, it was a complete rip-off of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974), which is a much better film anyway. All Zombie did differently was add neon lights.So, my expectations for ""The Devil's Rejects"" really weren't very high. But I began hearing reviews from people who saw the film before it was released saying that it was very different and much better than ""House"". And then I saw the previews, which looked promising. So, my expectations went up just a little. However, I was still pretty weary. I just wasn't sure if I could trust Zombie. But I went into the theater with an open mind. The lights dimmed. And what I saw was the glorious return of the true horror film. Rob Zombie more than redeemed himself with this brutal, funny, and utterly spectacular film. He worked out all the pacing kinks of ""House"", took away the flashy neon-light look, and replaced them with a gritty, violent masterpiece of terror.""The Devil's Rejects"" follows the three surviving members of the psychotic murderer family from ""House of 1000 Corpses"", who have been given the nickname ""The Devil's Rejects"" by the locals. They're on the run from the police, and along the way, they just happen to engage in murder, blasphemy, and sexual abuse. The exploitation fan inside of me rejoiced. In a twisted away, I loved everything I was seeing. And on top of all of this, Rob Zombie managed to put together just about the best mix of snappy dialogue and music I've witnessed since ""Pulp Fiction"". He even made me dig ""Freebird"", and I REALLY dislike Lynyrd Skynyrd.This has been a truly wonderful summer for horror fans. First, the French terror masterpiece, ""High Tension"", then George A. Romero's excellent return to form, ""Land of the Dead"", and now, Rob Zombie's truly glorious coming-into-his-own-as-a-filmmaker, ""The Devil's Rejects"".

The first film was pretty much a new take on Texas Chainsaw Massacre type horror film. The second one reminds me of what Quentin Tarantino would have done with it.It has action and bloody gory violence and it is here that it is very Tarantino like. The music also gives off that Kill Bill style. The only thing it really lacked was the horror part that was in the first film, even though it is better than the first film it still had more of a torture porn genre than anything.It is a very disturbing film in many ways and if that's the kind of film you like then this film is definitely should be on your next rent or buy list.",The Devil's Rejects

I haven't seen ""1000 Corpses"", and I haven't been very interested of Rob Zombie's music either. But this one goes straight to the top category: OK, the story may remind you of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or some other classics, but that don't make this film any worse. TCM's story reminds you of Psycho, Psycho reminds you of Ed Gein, Ed Gein reminds you of other sick people... This kind of talk about ""original story lines"" misses the points really badly. I think main thing is the feeling: The feeling some movie is made with, and the feeling it gives to you. I think this movie is much more believable than, let's say TCM. These people are REAL: Real sick people. The directing is good, the acting is good, cinematography is good, music is REAL good, everything is good. There's sex, there's humor, there's horror.

Also warning to viewers this film is as zombie as it gets and if you aren't a fan of his other works you may want to avoid this one. If you like zombie you know what you're into and this film goes to the extremes in everyway. I will avoid a synopsis since other reviewers have covered it a ton of times but instead I will focus on what this film succeeds at and fails at. This film succeeds at gore, sleaze, intense scenes, cheesy scenes and the likes. The acting in this film is something special and in every good ways, the characters are also strong and stick to who they were in the film before this. My favorite character being The Captain played by Sid Haig (rest in peace). The atmosphere is also amazing. I can't really complain about anything except maybe a few pacing issues and a few unrealistic scenes but thats not what this film is really about it's more meant to be a fun ride for the whole family, except the kids, may not be appropriate.

The Fireflys are serial killers, that also are made to look cool. They have as much depth as a fishbowl, but they are still the protagonists. They go around stripping and murdering innocent people. Did I mention that they are the heroes? Well, anyways, they are chased by this evil Sheriff, who is evil as well. Uhhh, they play Lynyrd Skynyrd songs and kill people and uhhh, well the point is....the point is.... Hey, you know what? There is no point. Zombie said as much.

I was soon to be wrong. The film lurches from one seemingly random scene to another and, apart from Sid Haig's Captain Spalding, everyone is just sooooo boring. And who exactly are we meant to be rooting for? Three people who've just murdered over 700 people between them or the insane cop who has lost all touch with reality? You know a film is bad when you start fast forwarding vast sections to find something interesting to look at. And, oh my God, Sheri Moon and Bill Mosely need to take some acting lessons!

The starting sequence was all too familiar with another 100 slasher/gore pics. The second time viewing I got past the start and appreciated Rod Zombie's direction and directing skills. At times you can see his rock band video style shining through. Not a bad thing, in a genre where so many first time directors cannot even instill a semi-decent performance from their actors. The acting was superb throughout, the characters were believably troubled souls who needed a swift kick into the ether and they got it. Soundtrack - sublime. Special effects - very good and gruesome. One thing of note which really set this film above others was the dialog, at times curses pile out of the degenerates faster than a cherry picker, at other times they deliver deliciously funny/chilling lines to great effect. As always, I have given this movie a high score because I love the genre, if you don't like horror/gore/violence then don't watch this movie! If you do then this is a deserved classic, which is head over heels better than the hundreds of similar movies which have attempted to go down this path and failed like a bad fart at a dinner party.",The Devil's Rejects

Rob Zombie's ""Devil's Rejects"" plays like a page out of every horror book ever written, and then throws in a few absurd ideas of it's own. I must say, even though 1000 Corpses did the same thing, to me it was better executed. This film just seemed to be missing the flare of the first outing. Why didn't Karen Black return for this? Another great ingredient missing this time, regardless of the reasons. For fans of horror, you really couldn't ask for more though. All the violence and sex you could ask for, and then some. Sid Haig was wonderful. William Forsythe was also great, but that didn't make up for lack of imagination in my opinion. The biggest letdown was the ending of the film. I just wanted to say, ""Get it over with already!"" Just a waste of time, trying to be ""artistic"" perhaps with the playing of the entire song ""Freebird""? Trying to make a statement? Well, it just annoyed me. I would've given it a lower rating, but the performances that I mentioned were enough to give it a 6. How ironic, the ""imperfect number""? Perhaps that might make Mr. Zombie happy. But one thing is for sure, take more time in making a movie next time, Mr. Zombie. A little hurried with this effort was a mistake.",The Devil's Rejects

Chances are, it'll do both.",3,17 October 2006,"The Devil's Rejects is easily one of the nastiest, sickest, most downright perverted and gruesome films I have ever seen. It is a grim, smelly portrayal of society at it's lowest. It made me feel dirty after watching, and made me feel like committing myself to a mental institution for enjoying a movie that forces you to sympathize with a family of deranged, sadistic murderous maniacs. Yes, as sick as it made me, I still often get the urge to watch it, though my reaction is always the same.This film opens at the house of the Firefly family, as a squad of heavily armed cops attacks the house, capturing Mama Firefly, as Baby and Otis escape. The latter two then take refuge at a desert motel, torturing, savagely humiliating, and killing a traveling folk band, as they await the arrival of their psychotic father, a clown who goes by Captain Spaulding. When he shows up, the evil trio hit the road, unaware that a sheriff who's brother they killed in ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is after them, and slowly stooping to the level of sanity, or lack thereof, of the Fireflys.I don't know what makes this film so addictive to me. It's the kind of film that I always vow to never watch again, but am always unable to resist the urge to watch it again when the opportunity arises. It's the kind of film you hate-to-love. I guess what makes it so interesting to me, is that it's a fascinating subject that the movie tackles. This is a HORROR movie, that takes a different twist on the ""homicidal hillbilly"" genre, depicting the events from the point of view of the villains, rather than the innocent victims. And making it even crazier, portraying the villains as real people, who have lives outside of slaughtering random people. They have friends, and they have family values. The main characters are a family who kill people and go out for ice cream. They commit atrocities of unspeakable proportions, and yet once a law enforcement officer gets a hold of them, we end up hating the person who is essentially trying to protect people like us from the fates suffered by the people in the motel, and rooting for him to die a gory death. That's what makes this horror film scary. Of course, it has the violent death, crazy characters, and hopeless tone that makes horror, but the real fear is for yourself, and how you can sympathize with the ultimate lowlifes. It makes you feel like you lack a soul.The dialogue and performances are also brilliant, as you've probably heard. Sid Haig, who plays Captain Spaulding, is a truly brilliant actor, displaying the ability to freak you out at one point, and at another, make you burst out with extremely nervous laughter. His character is a clown, and he is the clown you were terrified of as a kid. He is the reason to be afraid of clowns. Bill Mosely plays as Otis, who is among the most despicable characters ever created. Good acting, is, in my opinion, when a character makes you feel what you're supposed to feel for them successfully. And Mosely successfully makes us feel like bashing his character's face in with a shovel, and make him suffer. Everyone else gives great performances, and the dialogue ranges from brilliantly disturbing, and disturbingly brilliant, even as the f-word pops up for the fiftieth time in thirty seconds.Now I must warn you again, this is not a movie everyone will share my opinions on. The word depraved perfectly describes this film. It is completely beyond my guess as to why comparatively tamer movies like Requiem For A Dream (which is in fact, the ultimate cautionary tale which should be seen by every teenager) gets slapped with an NC-17, while this movie, which wallows in bad taste, gore, and perversion, can be seen by any kid, IF he has a parent stupid enough to take him. This movie is filled to the brim with disturbing content, and I am not recommending this to everybody. If you don't mind any of what I mentioned, than you may enjoy it. But easily scared prudes beware. God have mercy on my ""soul"", 8/10.This movie is incorrectly rated R for Sadistic Violence, Strong Sexual Content, Language, and Drug Use. If this isn't NC-17, the MPAA might as well retire that rating, as it is no longer of any use. Sex: 10/10 Violence: 10/10 Swearing: 10/10 Drugs: 8/10",The Devil's Rejects
207,knuckles_and_sonic,Unreal,9,14 February 2007,"My God where do I begin? This is a work of art. Its not really a horror film as many others have said. Its more exploitation than anything else. Its rude, crude disgusting and bloody. Zombie delivers some incredibly absurd dialouge while making us love and loathe the characters he portrays at the same time. The acting is perfect. The violence is over the top. The language is filthy and repulsive but sometimes funny. An unrelenting trip into the vulgar and demented world of Zombies creative genius. Even if you hated the House Of 1000 Corpses, you'll like this or hate it. Depends on your tolerance levels for profanity and violence. Watch it, Enjoy it (Hopefully) and then post your comments.

208,jimboduck,A Worthy Addition to Serial Killer Genre  7 (Not Bad),7,21 November 2005,"The one line that comes to mind when I think about DEVIL'S REJECTS is ""Rob Zombie pulled it off."" It turned out to be a pretty good movie that certainly had an unconventional style. I would easily recommend it over several of the mainstream productions I've seen recently.The best aspect of this movie is that it's not burdened with morals. Since there are no contrived good or bad values outlined in the movie, DEVIL'S REJECTS is a film that is blessed with freedom to roam. It is more likely than your conventional production to elicit a wider range of reactions, to make people think afterward, and, most importantly, to be remembered and watched again.Still, there's no point to the movie. That's not a bad thing. It's like sitting in the back seat of a car, which makes good sight seeing. But sometimes that leaves you itching for the wheel. Rob Zombie's in the driver's seat, and if you ask him where the storyboard is, he'd probably reply, ""Yeah, whatever. I'll get to that. First I need to pick up my accordion from Bill Ta's house.""Sure, the plot doesn't make much sense, but then neither does the sound of a jackhammer. The courteous sounds of real life can sometimes fit nicely together, but more often chaos reigns supreme. Stuff happens, and sometimes you feel like an ice-cream cone for no reason. DEVIL'S REJECTS plays out like leisurely road trip through the American South where the passengers have a knack for short tempers and spontaneity. Any hint of a specially designed plot line is abandoned, as the sprawling events unfold like a blood splatter on the wall. What comes through is a thick wad of southern-drawl attitude that bowls through the desert like a meat grinder.This movie is no doubt influenced by David Lynch, Tarantino films, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and such - as if all those films mated and bore a malnourished kid who listens to ACDC and doesn't listen to a word you say. The nice thing is that DEVIL'S REJECTS is ballsy enough to stand out on its own, apart from its incestuous forefathers.JYJimboduck-dot-com",The Devil's Rejects

There's absolutely no part in this movie where you should pity the main characters - so why are you giving it a bad review because you hate them? The movie will affect people in a different way for everyone who sees it. But, if you walk out of the theater hating the premise and the characters, the movie, in my opinion, has accomplished one of its goals.The movie is created, in my opinion, for two main audiences: ones that like to see a good bloody horror show, and those who like understanding human's violent tendencies. I won't ruin anything with specifics, but I loved this movie for the insight on violence breeds violence, and breeds more violence. It's amazing how easy it is to turn someone into an animal with the proper ingredients (fear, revenge, etc). The Sheriff's assent into darkness gives us an inner turmoil we should have seen in Revenge of the Sith.Liking this movie has nothing to do with liking the characters or pitying them.

It was complete trash. BUT its sequel (DEVIL'S REJECTS) is a charmer of the depraved sort. My wife even enjoyed it and this is certainly not her usual cup of blood...I mean tea. She describes it as late night, Showtime, almost porn kind of entertainment. You know you shouldn't be enjoying it but you can't help yourself. It's not very scary but there are some horrific images that will stick with you a bit. I expected to be repulsed by extreme gore but Mr Zombie spared us even on the Director's Cut DVD. Don't let me fool you cause this film does have its share of gore, nudity and harsh language but it's great characters, twisted sweetness and love of the horror genre make it an original ride. It's a blast trying to figure out which horror classics a lot of the supporting actors are from (including cast members from SALEM'S LOT and HALLOWEEN) I couldn't sing you one note of a Rob Zombie song but I could sing the praises of his accomplished funhouse of a movie.

Unfortunately her scenes are very limited and she might be the best actor of the bunch - and that is not saying a lot.So, if you can see the unrated version, and can get around the horrible acting, the gore and sex and language will not disappoint a horror movie fan.

Teased, taunted, anyone might turn to making this type of gore-fest when they grew up.Having said that, this is a surprising good film. Sure, it's got blood and guts and the ubiquitous head in the fridge (doesn't every horror film these days?) but it's a lot more than that. It's fast-paced, funny and surprisingly realistic even though it doesn't take itself too seriously. These are sick bastards (and I'm not just talking about the filmmakers here) and I do not doubt that there are depraved people like this around in real life. Therefore, it's actually quite scary to get an 'inside' peek into their world.I though this would be a movie like 'The Hills Have Eyes' which I didn't like and the likes of which has been done a lot better elsewhere but it wasn't.

216,pronins,A true horror film/a modern horror classic,10,23 July 2020,"Easily Rob Zombie's best film. It's brutal and absolutely relentless. Great directing and perfect sense of timing - every time I felt the violence was getting uncomfortable and over the top, Zombie brought in some other element, such as comic relief, so I never felt like anything was excessive. Also, in the end the ""bad guys"" get punished severely, to the point you begin to actually empathize with them, so all the violence shown previously is somehow ""justified"" by this extreme act of vengeance. This film is easily up there with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), in that its atmosphere and tone are dark and nihilistic. To those who complain about violence and brutality - please just go watch something else. This is a HORROR film, not a Christmas special.",The Devil's Rejects
217,FMACDONALD,A Fun And Wild Ride On A Horror Movie Roller Coaster,8,23 July 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is not a movie for everybody. It's a horror movie fan's horror movie. Although there is more action than anything else it's still a wild fun ride. The film is the second film from Rob Zombie, the former front-man from the heavy metal band White Zombie. If you are a Zombie fan and have heard his music or seen his live shows (something I strongly urge all metal fans to see) then you know that he's a horror fanatic. The Devil's Rejects is the sequel to Zombie's first film House Of 1,000 corpses. In this film a sheriff played by William Forsythe is hell bent on taking down the evil Firefky family who murdered his brother in House Of 1,000 corpses. During a raid on the families run down house of horror Baby (Played by Zombie's wife Sherri Moon Zombie), her brother Otis and Captain Spaulding (Played by the legendary horror film vet Sid Haig) escape and are on the run. During their time on the lam Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding come across some people who have the unfortunate luck of meeting these three. The sheriff is on their every move however giving The Devil's Rejects (as they are dubbed by the media) hardly any chance to make any moves. There are notable underground film stars who make appearances if you are into the independent film scene such as Danny Trejo, and that guy who played Sloth in The Goonies (one of Spielberg's best movies, when he made real movies) who was, for many years rumored to be dead. Like I said The Devil's Rejects is not for anybody. As I said before it's horror movie fan's horror movie. It's not a horror flick in the same vein as a Friday The 13th, Halloween, or Nightmare On Elm Street movie. It's all psychological scares. The Otis character is probably one of the most evil characters ever created. The Devil's Rejects and it's predecessor House Of 1,000 Corpses plays just like a Texas Chainsaw Massacre flick or the recent Cabin Fever, now there's a quality horror flick. Like Texas Chainsaw the film takes place in the late '70's. Which add's a great feeling to the film. Some people might be turned off by a heavy metal singer turned film maker, but unlike most so called ""master's of horror"" Zombie get's the genre. He makes ""old school"" horror movies. Hollywood has forgotten how to make good horror films. Just recently they've been getting better with the Dawn of the Dead remake as well as the Texas Chainsaw remake. Zombie doesn't rely on people in masks who don't say a word and never run after their victims with a big ax, knife, machete, whatever the choice of weapons is. He relies on good old fashioned creepiness, and psychological scares. That's the way horror should be done. I personally thought The Devil's Rejects was not scary. Was it creepy? yeah it was. It definitely has it's moments. On a scale of 10 I give The Devil's Rejects an 8 out of 10. Is it good? It's great. Is it better than House Of 1,000 Corpses? No way. House of 1,000 Corpses rates a 10 out of 10. However after seeing this film I think Hollywood has it's new ""master of horror"" (a title long held by John Carpenter, who passed the torch to Wes Craven), his name is Rob Zombie.",The Devil's Rejects

221,boy_in_red,The Devil's Rejects is not always an easy film to watch,7,2 September 2006,"The Devil's Rejects is not always an easy film to watch. It has a genuine savagery that makes recent films such as Hostel or Saw II, non spectacular though they were, appear rather tame.I think part of the reason the film is such uncomfortable viewing is through Rob Zombie's creation of a strong sense of ambiguity as to who we are supposed to sympathise with- who are the antagonists and the protagonists? Initially things seem quite clean cut- psychopathic killers= evil, Sheriff on a vigilante mission = good, but then the lines blur. The Sheriff turns nasty, yet we the audience take joy in his sadism- are we as bad as these killers? And at the same time we the audience feel flashes of sympathy for the killers too- through glimpses of their own, warped domestic bliss. This is interesting andone that gets under your skin and disturbs.I have to mention the humour also- which is also a nice contrast to darkness, though some of the humour is very close to the edge- you DO need those moments of light relief, to prevent the proceedings becoming completely grimy and depressing.The only main downside of this film is it does at times feel overly long, almost deliberately drawn out,and that can distract from the intensity of things.Personally this film marks a huge improvement for Rob Zombie after the debacle that was House Of 1000 Corpses, a masturbatory fan boy effort which had an okay build up but quickly descended into cartoony drivel. With The Devil's Rejects Rob Zombie seems to have shifted focus from being a kid with a film camera and a budget, and shifted focus on telling a story, and making the audience FEEL something, and he actually does a pretty good job of it too.Special mention has to go to Sheri Moon. A real delight to watch. I can't help but smile when I see her on screen- I wouldn't be at all surprised if she finds herself with a huge gay following. A lovely mixture of sassiness, innocence and an edge of something slightly darker. I like her a lot- well at least when she's not making racist playground chants fashionable again.I'm actually excited now about Zombie's remake/ reinvention/ prequel of Halloween. Okay so the term ""remake/ reinvention/ prequel"" fills me with an underlying sense of dread, but I'm going to breathe out and try trust Rob Zombie on this one. If nothing else, I know it'll be anything but bland.",The Devil's Rejects

They embark on a killing spree and just enjoying themselves up until a rather odd conclusion.I am a follower of Bloody-Disgusting.com and I kept up with the hype of this film. The first was nothing special. It had its moments, but in twenty years, I doubt I'll even think about it.

If he had made this for an even broader audience, I think that it would have been wonderful.Even still, I enjoyed this film. It was exactly what I expected and I enjoyed it.

You tend to overlook bad acting in more comic films like house of 1000 corpses because it had a B-movie sensibility.This film tries to play it too straight and this puts the spotlight right on the stilted dialogue and atrocious acting.The whole film tries to convince you how clever it is by showing people acting exactly opposite of what anyone considers decent human conduct. For some reason some people find this entertaining. I just find it juvenile, and boring. Its not clever, the writer of the film isn't clever, and neither is the director.They just show their lack of creativity and express this frustration over being losers by tearing down the conventions of humanity and pretending like they're worth a damn.They're not, they're losers, and they are profiting from garbage.

225,worthythorn24,Ferocious,9,13 November 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is Rob Zombie's follow-up to the inferior, but fun ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". In that film, we were introduced to the Firefly clan; a group of sadistic, devil worshiping serial killers who live in a nightmarish house filled with horror and suffering. The main difference between that film and this one is that here Zombie makes a motion picture. In ""House"", he merely set out to totally shock the audience.At the beginning of this movie, we see the Ruggsville police arrive at the Firefly home and engage in a shootout with them. Several police officers and family members are killed in the ensuing battle, with Otis and Baby escaping capture through a storm drain. At this point the film turns into a retread of ""Natural Born Killers"", only with a bit of a twist. Almost from the onset, the tone of the film is very intense, especially the performance of William Forsythe as Sheriff Wydell. The sheriff is out for revenge against the media dubbed ""The Devil's Rejects"" for the murder of his brother in ""House"". Wydell begins to walk the line and eventually completely crosses over into the realm of no return. Forsythe puts forth an incredible turn in this movie and really should be considered for some sort of award for his portrayal of the revenge-obsessed sheriff. Not to be overlooked is Sid Haig as the infamous Captain Spaulding, who completely owned the first film and here continues to steal every scene that he is in.There are tons of strong performances here, and a lot of appearances by 70's horror movie icons such as Ken Foree and Michael Berryman. Both of them have really fun roles in this movie. As a matter of fact, the entire movie sort of brought back memories of 70's horror, which sadly has been replaced by the CGI-infused PG-13 horror movies of today. This movie is very fierce and Zombie never let it get away from him like he did in HOTC. You can literally see how he has grown as a director and I expect more good things to come in the future. With his rock background, his use of music in this piece is nothing short of brilliant (I'll never hear ""Freebird"" the same way ever again). One thing that was neat to see was how the mental deterioration of Sheriff Wydell plays out on screen. At one point, Zombie makes his audience question, albeit only briefly, who the REAL bad guys are? If you want to watch a movie that is an intense, thrill ride where you NEVER know what will happen next, check this one out. Filled with blood, torture, and very dark moments of levity. I give this one a VERY strong 9/10.",The Devil's Rejects
226,crousbrandon,A Zombie Masterpiece!!,9,10 November 2019,"This film is one of zombies best if not his best film, the great things about this film is that its way different than house of 1000 corpses, it feels very real, it very sadistic and disturbing and makes hostel look like the newspaper's quick crossword.Here the police have discovered the firefly family's connection to the brutal murders over the last few months, they raid their house and kill Rufus, baby and Otis manage to escape and mother firefly is taken into custody.
The sheriff is hell bent on getting these crazed killers killed that at times you want to sympathize with them, given that the sheriif are just like then and seems to enjoy it a bit too much . You do ultimately feel for them which is weird since they do allot of terrible things here.The other bog thing is that this film has an completely different tone than the first film, its much more darker and kind of filthy, the colourfulness is gone in exchange for a more gritty look and in your face kind of feel, the characters ate not over the top anymore, baby is not a cackling mess anymore she toned down allot, they are more sick and disturbing here.Sheri moon zombie, bill mosely, did Haig shine in their roles here!!! Baby is much more mature , than the girly child she was in the first, Otis is more hardcore and devilish, cutting off a mans face and giving it to his wife to wear, he shoves a gun up a woman's privates , and captain Spaulding has a way bigger role here. They are essentially on the run from the law enforcement here that's the basic story .Overall , while its disturbing and everything its a great movie with great characters and acting. It might be his best movie to date.
Well done to everyone involved

227,Imaculata,"Same old tune, same problems as the previous movie",6,30 April 2016,"This movie is a direct sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, and just like that movie, it has many of the same problems. Just like in the previous movie, it lacks characters that show any agency, and the villains are more interesting than the victims. The Devils Rejects features the return of such characters as the crazy clown Captain Spaulding, who is the most entertaining character in both movies. In this movie he has a much bigger role, which is welcome.Rob Zombie has chosen not to exhaust weird video effects to death, this time around. Instead he has chosen for a more documentary style, with shaky camera shots, and deliberate extreme close ups. He also does sliding screen transitions, as if looking through a picture book. The movie also has a deliberate dirty look to it, and the extreme close ups help highlight the dirty look of all the freaks. I liked the direction and the style of the movie.But again, this movie is plagued by the same problems as the previous movie. Look, I love a good horror movie. I even enjoy some of the really gory stuff. But this is just a long row of abuse scenes, many of which sexual in nature, and there's very little 'fun' to it, or suspense to it. Its again the lack of agency on behalf of the characters, and the fact that they aren't fleshed out at all. None of the victims are compelling characters. And the movie falls into the trap of a long series of ancient horror movie clichés. I'm talking so ancient, they could be fossils.You know the drill: Characters outnumbering a villain who is only armed with a knife, and yet not making any coordinated effort to attack the villain. Waiting forever to steal a gun from the villains, then waiting forever to shoot the villain, thus giving them plenty of time and opportunity to attack, and of course the gun is not loaded. And again we have the victim running straight into the arms of Captain Spaulding, not realizing that he is part of the gang. It is literally the previous movie all over again.The plot again goes nowhere. A bunch of victims are stuck in one location, where they make no intelligent attempt to escape or retaliate, despite having plenty of opportunity to do so. And then they all get abused and killed one by one. How are we supposed to be invested in this story? But fortunately the movie has one thing going for it. It does something that House of 1000 Corpses did not do: It takes a turn in the last half of the film. I'll give it credit for that. But it was not enough to keep me interested, since the movie had already lost me long before the turn in the plot.And its a shame, because Captain Spaulding is entertaining, its directed well, the effects are good, and it has a nice style to it... but as a film it just sucks. There is zero suspense, and the montage at the end feels like a sloppy way to end a movie. And why does the director indulge so much in sexual abuse? I don't mind nudity, but the context is definitely rapy in nature, and just not fun to watch. When is rape (even if it borders on it) ever a good thing in a movie? I'm not condemning people who like this movie, but what do they see, that I don't?",The Devil's Rejects
228,bonnie91,This is more of an action movie than a horror movie,5,21 August 2006,"I went to see ""Devil's Rejects"" because I absolutely loved ""House of a 1000 Corpses"", but I found it disappointing. Yes, there is gore and violence, yes the bad guys are scary, and yes, it has atmosphere, but not a creepy one; to me it played more like a shoot-em-up action movie than a horror film. It's as different from HoaTC as could be and, for me, that took a lot of the magic out of the movie. I'd even go so far as to say that sometimes it had a decidedly Western feel to it, and no, I don't like Westerns! I guess if you watch it without the idea that it's a horror movie it might be fairly entertaining, but don't expect too much if you're a lover of the genre.I'd recommend maybe renting it, but just to help support the WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES campaign.",The Devil's Rejects
229,TJ1380,Well done exploitation movie,7,14 August 2005,"My one-line summary is probably about the best way I could describe this movie in a few words. This is a sick, brutal, relentlessly violent exploitation horror film in the tradition of similarly sick, brutal, relentlessly violent low-budget exploitation horror films of the 1970s that usually serve no other purpose than to shock and disgust viewers with some of the most depraved acts of violence imaginable. This is exactly the kind of movie that Rob Zombie set out to make, and he and everyone else involved knows this. That being said, there is still something that separates ""The Devil's Rejects"" from other films like it. While most films of this kind are generally pretty horrible, ""Rejects"" actually manages to be a good film. It's clearly not for everyone, but it's still a good film.It's hard to like a film in which the main characters are Satan-worshiping serial killers who spend roughly half of the movie terrorizing, torturing, mutilating, and sexually assaulting their innocent victims, yet there still are a lot of good things that can be said about this movie, especially when one considers the kind of crap that we usually see from this genre. While it's not exactly a visually beautiful film, the simple cinematography still manages to be very effective in telling the gruesome story. The entire film is shot in an almost amateurish manner that gives it the feeling of a documentary or (perhaps even more disturbingly) a home video. The lack of Hollywood polish inherent in this style of ""home video horror"" makes what is seen on screen all the more disturbing, since it adds a certain realism that is not seen often in movies. It sounds like an incredibly simple concept, but it is also very effective. The acting is also quite a bit better than most films in this genre. While it probably won't win any awards, the lead actors actually manage to add some depth to the characters and almost makes them likable. Considering the characters that we're talking about here, this is no easy task.The flaws in this film are really about a matter of taste. Like I said, there are downright evil and despicable characters in this movie, and I'm not just talking about the family of serial killers that the title refers to. There are absolutely no ""good guys"" in this movie. Even the determined sheriff who is obsessed with catching the rejects proves to be just as evil as everyone else in the movie. There is practically nobody to cheer for in this movie; everyone is just as evil as everyone else, aside from the poor bastards that get in the rejects' path.This is a very mean-spirited and cruel movie, but it's also supposed to be. As I said, it is definitely not for everyone (I wouldn't even recommend it to most people I know), yet in the end it still has some artistic merit that isn't usually seen in a horror movie. Rob Zombie is turning into a rather competent filmmaker (I never saw his earlier movie, but I hear that ""Rejects"" is definitely an improvement), but it wouldn't hurt him to make a movie with morals as well as artistic merit.",The Devil's Rejects
230,Was-it-All-a-Dream,The Devil's Rejects (2005),2,2 May 2009,"I was pleasantly surprised when I watched Rob Zombie's directorial debut, House of 1,000 Corpses, the year before The Devil's Rejects was released. I say ""pleasently,"" because I was told the movie was a complete sack of (fill in the blank yourself). The movie's reputation was pretty up and down. It had its' detractors (the person who gave me their DVD copy, which I still have, for free), it had its' fans. And then, it had people like me. People who didn't really know what to think of it. In a way, I still don't. Though, it's a pretty obvious movie. Intentionally kitschy and nostalgic for the era of funky 70's culture watching old black and white 50's horror films and Universal monster movies on TV, creature features, tourist traps, roadside attractions, American small towns on Halloween night. Informal, stylish, fun in lots of ways (sometimes even when it was crude), and trademark of the Rob Zombie I knew from his music career. Then, the movie tried to turn the kitsch into ""brutal"" torture-film type horror and failed miserably. As it also did when it tried to turn into a trippy freakshow at the very end. That's House of 1,000 Corpses in a nutshell. Imperfect but definitely worth a watch. That was 2003, this is 2005.Billed and sold all over the place as a horror film, The Devil's Rejects is not a horror film. In fact, it's Rob Zombie bending over backwards to kiss the butt of every exploitation cliché and stereotype in the book. A tribute to Bonnie & Clyde, The Wild Bunch, westerns, road trip movies, escaped criminals out on the lam... And when it could find the time, it would pencil-in a rip-off of either The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left, or Bride of Chucky. Just so the studio could still call it a horror film and cash in on it being a sequel to House, which they sold as a horror movie. Another reason this is often considered a horror movie is because it was released in 2005, the year the torture film began to rear its' lame head into the mainstream. By this time, Saw had bred at least one sequel. Then, Wolf Creek had already been released and caused a sensation. And, the buzz on Eli Roth's Hostel was going through the roof. But, The Devil's Rejects isn't even a torture film. Not that I care. I'm just stating the facts. What Rejects is more than anything else is an action flick. Bad guys hunted by corrupt cop, hostage situation, guns and fast cars, sleaze... No wonder I don't usually watch this kind of movie.Now, if I were to offer my critique of Rejects, no critique would be complete without me saying things like- pandering to the lowest common denominator. This movie was written like Rob Zombie thinks everyone who would want to watch a horror film on the more exploitation side is a complete idiot who didn't even make it past the 3rd grade. To call this unintelligent would be an understatement. To call it entertainment would be an insult. Every character in the film, save for I believe a mother getting into her car and her small child, talks like they were born in a Special-Ed class room. Now, I guess that could be a deliberate choice on the part of Rob Zombie. Not because he finds it more interesting than actual dialogue and characterization, but perhaps his ambition was to try making the film a sort of greatest-hits compilation of the most moronic things white trash would say. Except that there are also black people in the movie. Or, maybe just Ken Foree (who, by the way, has done much better than this), I'm not sure. I don't really know what was going through Zombie's mind, or if he even had one at all at the time. But this movie is so stupid, it's tedious.And that is about as politely as I can say it. I could make you a list of all the unbelievably idiotic things in this movie, but if you saw it, you already know. I'll just give the movie one major credit and head home. It's almost two entire hours long. Wow, right! You'd think, being that long, there would have been a point to it. Not really. But toward the last half hour, after watching the criminals being stupid and having ""their fun"" and an evil corrupt cop be a total jerk and not follow the rulebook in trying to apprehend them, the film stumbles onto a last-minute bit of genius. The movie, having already tried to turn the raping, murderous criminals into heroes (or, ""Anti-Heroes"" as it says in the current 'Handbook of Pretentious, Self-Righteous, Trendy Excuses in Defending Bad Movies & TV')... has the corrupt cop actually catch the criminals and then torture them for a good, solid 15 to 18 minutes. In all seriousness, who would defend the criminals? The movie glorified what they did by making them look cool, having Bill Moseley overact, etc. It was surprising to finally see the criminals being tortured like that. Then, ultimately die at the end. If only the corrupt cop had lived. Now that would really be breaking the cliché.",The Devil's Rejects
231,jackbenimble,The red's are still coming.,1,26 December 2009,"I notice in some of the other reviews that people were confused in that although they felt repulsed by it, this film made no sense to them. I think this film has a clear message. It's very insulting. It says that you are nothing more than a pleasure seeking animal and that life is just a meaningless array of superficialities. That good and evil don't really exist and ethics don't really exist and 'do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law'. A new kind of American 'freedom' if you like. It is telling you that the de-moralisation of America and the Western world is about complete. This message is carefully embedded within a fantastic southern country rock soundtrack, cool retro clothes, enhanced colour, actors with character faces, and obvious references to the American 'Dream' with great U.S. scenery replete with open highways and skies, deserts, etc. This is classic communist style subversion. And you thought McCarthy was a nut! No doubt Zombie ( what kind of idiot has a name like 'Zombie', anyways? ) has been handsomely paid and financed to put out this crap. One can only hope that when the Second American war of Independence begins that the citizens will point their second amendment right at the right enemies of the nation like Zombie and his ilk and not play out the drama in this film by taking out their frustration by senselessly torturing and ripping each other apart.",The Devil's Rejects
232,TheDuke-2,Zombie is the new Carpenter/Craven,8,23 July 2005,"Yes this movie is sometimes over the top, but if you are a horror movie fan then you should not miss it. Rob Zombie in 2 movies has already shown me that he is in Hollywood to stay. The man knows images and music too well and his weird artistic expression and editing is what separates him from everyone else. He draws from old horror movies, recent ones and adds a bit of ""side show"" style that really gives a normally B renter movie a lift. Also the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission, since his music background really comes through in his blending of scenes with the tracks. The list of character actors he gets for the movie are priceless, some if you're 30+ will remember from TV.Over all Rob Zombie is for real and after this movie, he will be noticed by major studios and will begin to get a bigger budget, just as Robert Rodriguez did a few years back.

235,Bub_the_zombie,Talented film-making,10,9 November 2006,"Any horror 'fan' can say what they will, Rob Zombie is the saving grace to the classic horror film we all know and love. The Devil's Rejects is a prime example of learning from a previous mistake.Rob realized that there is such a thing as too many visuals and TOO many colors. Rob also went fan-boy crazy in House, dwelling on some of his favorite views expelled from childhood favorites. In The Devil's Rejects, Rob becomes more familiar with the fact that the camera isn't a toy, but a powerful tool, that if used right, could emit something spectacular - no matter what the subject matter.One thing that stands out in this film is the reversal of fates for our characters. In most cookie cutters, we find the point of view from that of the victim, giving very little camera time to the villain. This worked extremely well in films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. From this perspective, we have the total opposite. Instead, we're shown first hand the point of view of the killers and ride along as they do what they do. In essence, Rob still takes the standard route because even tho we're along for the ride on the escape cross country, we never really know why they do what they do - Just like in the first Halloween, we know not why Mike decides to stalk and slasher babysitters on halloween night.Nevertheless, here we are. We're taken on a journey with our characters where we find out that besides the fact they're murderous goons, they know all to well the meaning of family or simply getting someones back in time of need. Talent rears its beautiful head as Rob slowly turns the screw until we're finally rooting for the guys we're supposed to be hating. He uses a symbol of goodness and distorts it (the cop), allowing the viewer to lower their sympathy guard enough to humanize the bad guys. I've heard a lot of remarks on what films Rob was giving nods to in The Devil's Rejects - I think a lot of people have points, but The Devil's Rejects places a lot of emphasis alongside The Hill's Have Eye's. It's like the primal instinct of revenge - to accommodate one life for another. It refers back to the old testament rule of thumb: 'An eye for an eye'. Not only this, but it digs deeper, giving leeway to a similar story (The Sawney Bean story) about a bunch of 15th century settlers who resorted to cannibalism- and- when found, were hanged by the locals out of rage. The torture the Sawney Bean family endured for their ghastly deeds wasn't too much further than the ghastly deeds performed on them by the locals - - As in the sheriff going through extremes to extract revenge for what the murderous Firefly clan did to his brother.Great cinematography, great characters, great soundtrack, great non-distinction of who we should be rooting for, wonderful atmosphere, with a kick of drive-in flick, accompanied by an early 80's action/thriller, based with an all out balls-to-the wall gore/exploitation film.Great film-making from a relative newcomer.

What a mess this film is! ""Easy Rider"" meets ""Natural Born Killers"". Bottom line: There's NOTHING to the film. No scares, no suspense, in fact, NO PLOT either. Just one mindless & pointless killing scene after another with some humor thrown in. A soundtrack that was more out of place then Michael Jackson at a strip club! The only redeemable factor to TDR are the performances & the intermittent parcels of humor. There isn't even a half-ass attempt given at an explanation or exploration to the psyches or motives of these 3 nut jobs. Are we to assume that they just popped out of their momma's shoot crazy from day one? The Sheriff Wydell character is the only attempt made at gaining some understanding of his mindset. But he ends up being just as twisted & sick as those he pursues. There are even moments where Zombie appears to garner some empathy maybe even sympathy for these 3 butchers via family good times flashbacks (move over Cunninghams!). Yes, I'm sure Charlie Manson had his ""special moments"" too! And I'm sure we'll all hear the avante-garde defense of ""it's a (snicker)brilliant 70's style exploitation movie.""

237,ibanez747,Devil's Rejects...Mildly Disappointing,7,25 July 2005,"***May Contain Spoilers*** I, like many other fans of the horror genre, had extremely high hopes for this one. Looking back on it, maybe too high. Devil's Rejects is a horror/exploitation film done in the 70's maverick mode. Though it works for the most part, it takes away from the horror. This was a movie that could have been a lot better had there been more focus on the actual hunting, chasing and physical destruction of victims and less on how much the killer family loves each other. The movie starts out with a raid on the compound from House of a 1000 Corpses. There is a shootout and Madame Firefly is arrested by police, while Otis and Baby escape. They later rendezvous with Captain Spaulding at an obscure motel. Otis and Baby arrive and take a group of hostages, a traveling cover band. The scenes involving the hostages and some of their deaths are cool. I think the use of guns, though, hurts the horror aspect. I think knives or blunt objects should have been incorporated much more than it did. In other words, too many shootouts and too many easy deaths. The fact they were hostages at gunpoint is not scary. This is a cliché of action films not horror. I think the focus was on the vile nature of the event with comedic twist. There were some funny interactions between and among the characters. There were long drawn out parts that really were kind of a waste. I go straight to the ice cream scene in the van. This part really annoyed me. I'm still puzzled to the question why. After witnessing their disgusting acts, why would I feel anything at all for these people? Am I supposed to go ""Awe, that's nice. Look they're having a family moment together""? This exemplifies my whole state in the movie. I was waiting for the movie to pickup. It never did. So that was my feeling after the movie...Unfulfilled, Disappointed.William Forsythe made the movie for me. Since he was the most gifted actor on the set, he really came through as the psycho cop. He was seemingly more brutal and more insane than the family he was hunting down. The focus of the movie was his hunt for the family as they were constantly on the run. He was dark and sadistic as well as humorous. Loved his character.Also I enjoyed Ken Foree. It seems like this horror movie vet has gotten some more phone calls and a subsequent career resurgence. His role was perhaps his most prominent since Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. He plays a 70's pimp and looks like he could have been right out of ""Dolemite"".Overall it wasn't an awful film. It was more original than the first one. It had better acting and it looked more focused on where Rob wanted to take the story. I felt despite the shortcomings of the first one; I felt the first one was a better ""horror"" movie of the two.6.5-7.0 out of 10",The Devil's Rejects
238,josephmpapp,The best Zombie can do,2,13 July 2017,"This is probably Rob Zombie's best film. It's got decent editing and the story works for the characters.Now for the reality: This movie still has horrible dialogue, acting, and characters. There are a few lines that would have been perfect had Rob Zombie kept them short and didn't add his redneck malarkey. There are scenes that are genuinely intense (the gun pantie scene) that end up falling apart because of bad acting. Bill Mosley has a moment where he says ""I am here to do the Devil's work,"" but the rest of the dialogue comes off as flat and it sucks.In the end, this movie is Zombie's best, but it's still no better than hearing Tutti F*ing Fruity over and over again.",The Devil's Rejects
239,Sheldonshells,Not nearly that great,5,6 July 2006,"This movie has its definite flaws; and dismissing a lot of overly ecstatic, spasmodic, and none-too-thoughtful reviews featured here (many obviously by ravenous fans of either Zombie himself, fans of really gory films, or fans of films that cater to their misanthropy, masochism and/or sadism they sadly feel from/toward post-modern humanity)it does, truthfully, contain a little merit anyway. The often examined concepts of good and evil, for one, is well showcased here (or at least definitely the evil side). And it shows that karma gets the ultimate say in the end when the gang is killed. The movie makes it clear that yes evil does certainly exit, and here it is in hard crystalline form; the devil's rejects are evil incarnate, even despite those funny little falsely poignant moments (like when the crew is listening to ""Free Bird"" in the few minutes between the blood soaked torture and killing sprees) when the viewer might be deluded into thinking they are something more(or rather this could be an inconsistency or oversight that is typical of novice directors/screenwriters). No matter how humanistically the director wants to frame this picture, by, for instance, speaking about how the gang is not supposed to be cheered on, the film exudes a kind of now all too familiar total detachment to believing in any good in humanity, and in catering to a heavily battered, morally devoid populace who are wont to see a film that vents their latent desire to see others get nice and tortured and to die hard(being, i guess, too cowardly or apathetic to do it themselves). Films such as these--Hostel, Hard Candy,Battle Royale, Chaos, Wolf Creek etc.-- must be checked, as long as they're going to keep coming out, to ascertain whether or not they are making any kind of real statement or are only tricking people into believing that they are, and are really only grossly irresponsibly stitched together resemblances of actual good films that give a veneer of ""originality"" or social or philosophical commentary while really being all about little more than seeing nothing but one-sided bleakness and negativity toward humanity--and having directors that know enough that there are many people out there who, sadly, want to see just that(money money to get some honey honey).

Writer/director Rob Zombie truly scored with this flick. Compared to its predecessor, REJECTS is above and beyond. HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES pales in comparison as merely an enjoyable fanfare work for horror nuts. THE DEVIL'S REJECTS shines as a revenge pick born of Zombie's love of horror, westerns, and 70s pop culture.Rob Zombie is no longer the fan boy here, he's finally the real deal.I feel that what makes REJECTS stand out is the cinematography - the look is amazing and adds so much. The camera movement too is key - I believe I only saw one or two still shots. The casting is insane! So many lovable horror icons : Ken Foree (DAWN OF THE DEAD), PJ Soles (HALLOWEEN), Michael Berryman (THE HILLS HAVE EYES), Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees unmasked), and gems including William Forsythe and Danny Trejo. The production design too is worth noting. The wardrobe, soundtrack, dialogue - everything is flawless in this film! Given the story and genre, this film is top notch. It doesn't get any better than this. As far as I'm concerned Rob Zombie has fulfilled his place in the world of cinema. This is the best thing he has ever done in his career.

Weak story period.,4,11 August 2005,"OK, I had to look a second time and I'm still scratching my head in disbelief, did this movie seriously get a 7.2 user rating!!! WOW, people please tell me those numbers come from kindness and generosity because this movie only had one great thing going for it, the soundtrack. I love a good 'R' rated film as much as the next guy, filled with language, sex, violence, nudity, hell I'd even prefer 'NC-17', but let the actors have some skills and the writer have a larger vocabulary consisting of more than curse words and slang. I experienced no fear, angst, or disgust and quite frankly I felt insulted that Rob Zombie seems to think all we need is bad language and blunt violence to be entertained. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) cost less money to make and used very little language, although, the blunt violence was there, it was accompanied by a score of disturbing sounds and descent acting. I felt the terror of TCM, I felt mischievous with a smirk of a grin at The Devil's Rejects cause they said a bad word.Regardless of my opinion on The Devil's Rejects ability to touch it's audience, I do however think Rob Zombie improved from 'Corpses' to 'Rejects' as a Writer and Director.

I had really loved Zombie's first film, HOUSE OF 1,000 CORPSES, and was looking forward to seeing how he was going to ""re-create"" the characters from that first film into this new one. Stylistically, this film is exceptional. Zombie knows how to build tension and has a real gift for being able to pay homage to the horror flicks of the 70's without insulting or copying them. His choices in casting is genius and the performances in this film are quite good. However, gone is the camp-value he infused into CORPSES. This film takes itself much more seriously and this does not help. In fact, the fact that Zombie focuses more on horror and torture without the same level of dark humor makes the film come off as somewhat cruel. Are we to actually enjoy seeing the victims tortured? Somehow, the fun of his first film is absent. However, for those of us who have an appreciation for the films of the original 70's renegade film makers such as Tobe Hooper -- you can't help but enjoy Zombie's style of filming. This film also enjoys have some of the best southern rock ever created to serve as its soundtrack. The three lead actors stand out and give great performances, but one wishes Zombie would have allowed them to go a bit more over the top. Karen Black did not return to play Moma Firefly which is too bad, but the actress who takes over the role does a great job. In the end -- I think this is an interesting and valid second film from Rob Zombie, but I hope that he allows his cast and his audience to have a bit more fun. The world has enough torture and violence -- if we are to see it in a film it needs to give us a bit of a scare and a bit of a laugh. If only he had utilized that dark/twisted since of humor a bit more. Still, it is worth a look -- but not for those of you who get upset by violence. And, please, this is not a movie for children.

247,nixar55,"Gritty, nasty fun",8,21 July 2005,"Let me first say I hated House of 1,000 Corpses. I thought it was more like a bloated music video than a horror movie. There were glimpses of talent, some moments of fear, but overall, it felt like an over-edited, over-art directed piece of fluff. The only thing I loved about the first movie was Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding.The Devil's Rejects is a much, much better movie. It *felt* like a movie. There was a structure. some really good lines in the script, and it was really atmospheric. Rob Zombie excels at the whole Peckinpah vibe - everyone's dirty-looking, worn, caked with dried blood. This movie wasn't supernatural at all and I appreciated that. It was the horror of random violence inflicted on innocents and sadists alike. It was really nihilistic and very, very funny. The casting was excellent. Sid Haig was still the best actor, but Bill Mosely was equally great, and Sherri Moon was a lot less grating. The cameos were well-done, too, especially Michael Berryman and Ken Foree.There were some slow monologues (mostly the sheriff's) and montages, but overall, the film went along pretty quickly. I have a lot of respect for Rob Zombie. I enjoy his music and I really like his taste. You could tell he put a lot of genre love and reverence into his movie, much like Tarantino, and I'm really happy to see him grow as a filmmaker. I got into a free advance screening, but I'd definitely pay money to see this movie again.",The Devil's Rejects
248,evetilly,Sympathy for The Devil's Rejects,8,23 September 2019,"Rob Zombie asks us to do something very strange with The Devil's Rejects. He asks us to fall for a family of depraved rapists, murderers, necrophiles, and perverts. It's subversive as can be and, you know what? It works.The Devil's Rejects is a follow up to his first film, House of 1,000 Corpses, but while it follows many of the same characters, the tone and style couldn't be more different. 1,000 Corpses was bathed in neon and technicolor terror, feeling more like a meth-infused funhouse than anything else. Rejects opts for a much more realistic approach, making most of the film take place in the colorless heat of the south.The Firefly family wake up to the siren call that they're surrounded by police. Soon, they're under siege and they have to flee through their underground tunnels. They're on the road, taking hostages and victims as they see fit as an equally deranged policeman tries to find them so he can dish out his own form of vigilante justice for the murder of his brother.Besides one poorly timed and useless scene involving a Marx Brothers expert, The Devil's Rejects is a well paced, intense action film with exploitation film leanings. The horror lands better than it did in 1,000 Corpses due to the realism it's presented with. Make no mistake - this is one nasty movie.Despite its mile wide mean streak, it's surprising that our leads come across as almost lovable as they do. In some ways, we root for them. They are a family after all and we can see that the man terrorizing them is just as demented as they are in many ways.",The Devil's Rejects
249,nfaust1,"More than one bargains for, this movie is a masterpiece.",10,24 July 2005,"Most of the critics, even those who like the movie, miss its point. Not a 'good guys/bad guys"" kind of movie, it's not actually even a horror film. We might think it is because Zombie's visual prowess rips the screen; in this, his power is damn near overwhelming. Right away, he pins us down with in your face close-ups and fast cutting, and we stay down all the way through the movie. The point is not so much the story that unfolds, it's the experience of the story that's important. The viewer is the main victim here, and I don't mean that as a criticism. Rendering us powerless is, I think, the film's goal; Zombie wants us to feel, but he also wants us to think about what we feel. In a good verses bad melodrama we stay hooked because we want to know how the story is going to turn out in the end. Given the extremity of this experience, I think it's pretty clear from the very start that nothing good will come from this; the good guys and bad guys are pretty interchangeable, and by the end dust and blood is all that will be left. Some critics seem to think Zombie glorifies his violence. Some even go so far as to say he wants us to root for the crazy family. This confuses me, because at no time did I feel Zombie condones the Firefly family antics; their victims, unlike in most Hollywood movies, feel what's happening to them. Indeed, the Firefly's, themselves, feel what's happening when the Sheriff turns the tables. Nothing glamorous here, at all. And if, for instance, the Entertainment Weekly critic really believes this film is a Hard Rock, guts and glory celebration, I really wonder: what movie did he see? Because Zombie's movie is not about rooting for this character or that, it's about the conflict between power and powerlessness. We're inside a world of moral and physical decay, a world devoid of meaning beyond that which stimulates senses, otherwise dulled and empty. HOUSE OF A THOUSAND CORPSES starts off with "" God Is Dead"" on a truck crossing the frame. Yes, He most certainly is, and with each mindless, crazy pop culture reference that follows, we begin to realize that culture and though is also dead; dead, but eating itself. Zombie has defined his point ever further in this movie. Torture in DEVIL'S REJECTS comes with comment; the characters talk, talk, talk; I think what they say is an attempt to give their actions meaning. But what meaning is there, even when the Sheriff does his bit, in annihilation? I think that's the film's point. We are meant to feel the physical and moral force of the film's violence; from the beginning it's a no-win situation all the way around the board. That ending, with Zombie's ironic use of Freebird, is the ending of BREATHLESS, BONNIE AND CLYDE, THE WILD BUNCH, THELMA AND LOUISE, and maybe a bit of WHITE HEAT all rolled into one. Zombie's two movies are both sharp and sophisticated social satires masquerading as exploitation movies. Within this form, Zombie can cut to the bone. He doesn't have to be nice or even justify his intention. He can leave out motivation that, in other kinds of movies, distance the viewer's relationship to violent and unpleasant action. We live in a violent world, and, with terrorism and such, it just seems to be getting worse and worse. The Fireflys do terrible things - and we accept what they do as being terrible - but the movie does not make them hockey mask killers with supernatural powers. These characters are human, they are a family; being so, they come at us with a frightening reality. Real people do terrible things. Zombie's vision seems modern and unpretentious to me. These people are real, and seemingly hopeless. What they believe and want out of life is reflected in how far they will challenge and tempt and goad those who have the unfortunate luck to be in their path. Sexual gratification doesn't seem to be the point: to them, an act of torture is a challenge, it's a philosophical act. That final moment chills us not because it's the Wild Bunch taking their last stand; we are effected because these characters have nothing, stand for nothing, and, somehow, they know it. This is a brilliant, serious film, a masterpiece that, I think, in time, will reveal much about our world and its current condition. Rob Zombie is one of the most important directors of his generation.",The Devil's Rejects

From the opening scene when the Rejects and the local police are in a massive gun Battle, you are hooked. From here the marker is laid. I rate this as the greatest shoot out ever committed to film.From here the direction, cinematography, scene colours and the 70's style dialogue kicks in. I'm not a fan of slasher films or exploitation films. I cant tell you when this film is parody or is being referential. I haven't even seen 1000 Corpses.I'm not sure if its a horror but it is scary. The film is ultimately about torture. It's not as gruesome as some have made out. Its just very threatening and nasty. When I watched this I didn't like a single character in the film.

In predictable fashion, they emerge the winner and move out on a killing spree for no other reason than to give this film at least some plot. That's about as creative as our friend Rob gets though, as the dialogue consists entirely of profanity in between such meaningful words as ""what"", and ""let's move"". I can honestly say that as a fan of horror movies for a long time there is not one likable character in this turkeys two hours. Seriously. I enjoy how the film credits Rob Zombie with creating such amazing characters as ""long-haired killer for no reason"" and ""psycho bitch that kills people"". If that's not good enough you got ""clown dude that makes lots of jokes about sex"". The film doesn't go into much detail about anything as there's no creativity in a flick which could have fit inside twenty minutes. The director however loves to drag out each scene by including lots of pointless rabble about Tutti Frutti - and a driving scene which plays to ""Free Bird"" for a good three minutes.

254,Chicky5150,Style over substance and pretty much anything else.,6,9 January 2006,"This is a well shot movie by a visually gifted director. Its filled with genre actors I like, and they're getting a chance to stretch their acting ranges in most cases. The special effects looked real, and the soundtrack was great. On a technical level, this was a triumph. On every other level, this was disturbing, and not in the way the director intended.The story - such as it is - is simple. The brother of Sheriff Wadell, killed in the first family, hunts the murderous Firefly clan down to kill them as revenge. They flee pursuit, killing and humiliating along the way until they reach a brothel, where there is a final conflict with a couple bounty hunters and the sheriff.The thing is - there is no one to root for. Zombie seems to want us to root for the killers, but that is impossible, these people are monstrous. The very fact that he wants to care about them is disturbing. The sheriff eventually becomes as bad as they are, and the victims are simply used and discarded. There is no emotional attachment to this film, I'm watching people I don't like hurt each other. Watching Zombie create this movie is sort of like going over Niagara falls in a barrel. Its hard to do, and if you survive its an accomplishment, but I fail to see the purpose in doing it.",The Devil's Rejects
255,severin72,Art or pornography?,8,1 November 2006,"Rather to my surprise, the answer is art (in stark contrast to Zombie's previous effort ""House of a Thousand Corpses""). This is a deeply disturbing film on several levels. The obvious one is the subject matter. The remnants of an extended family of psychopaths are on the run from the law and slaughter anything that gets in their path. This story, essentially a road-movie/revenge western/seventies exploitation flick is played dead straight. It's savagely graphic and, if you have an ounce of empathy left in you, in places it is hard to watch. ""Rejects"" is uncommonly well acted courtesy of a deep and experienced cast. Bill Moseley (eerily physically recalling Charles Manson) creates, in Otis B. Driftwood, one of the genre's most dreadful yet human characters. It's a truly memorable performance. Sid Haig again shows the kind of imposing presence that makes you wish Hollywood could have found a better use for him decades ago. Inside the man the spirit of Sterling Hayden mourns. So far, so technically proficient but this is hardly re-inventing the wheel and the long shadow of Tarantino looms over a fair bit of the dialog. The film rises to the level of art because the killers are not just mindless one-dimensional purveyors of splatter effects to the depraved masses. They are real characters, with pasts, motivations, and, worst of all, the capacity for love. This is the first curve Zombie throws the audience. The second is to have the killers become the victims, tortured with the same merciless brutality they have themselves repeatedly exhibited. While the audience is still (hopefully) struggling with how to react to this moral puzzle we run in to an ending that is, what? Sad? Beautiful? Moral closure? All of the above? None? Does it obscure the suffering of the victims or does it avenge it? I'm not sure, but the fact the film made me ask such a question, alone elevates it head and shoulders above most. Supposedly, at one point Bill Moseley (no stranger to this kind of thing) told Zombie he was having a hard time doing this film. Zombie's response apparently was; ""Art isn't safe"". Grudgingly, I take his point.",The Devil's Rejects
256,mrw8,wore my fast forward button out,3,29 April 2006,"I watched at least 80% of this movie in fast forward.Why? Because there was absolutely no point in listening to the dialog. IT was of the ""Get over here before I come over there and kill you."" variety. Basically it has no depth whatsoever. Each episode is basically an extension of the first scene. Thus it is one shoot out after another. You could just put the first ten minutes on a loop and watch it over and over again for 100 minutes and there you go. Dialogue like this is the fault of the Zombie. He wrote the first thing that came into his head and let it stay. Then he allowed the actors to deliver their lines with apparently no rehearsals. The dialog fall dead from the lips every time. What I love the most is a family of pathological killers who still agonize over the pain and death of one another. Thus in one scene a killer is taunting innocent people and torturing them for no good reason except to burn film, and in another scene they are saying ""No you can't kill momma."" Are they crazy or not? This contradiction falls on the shoulders of Zombie, who can not think past the next four seconds of film and threw more stop action footage and still shots than in news reels. I'm sure some will think this is top notch entertainment because Zombie goes for several styles and tones, praying one of them will find an audience. But the conflicting styles render the film hopelessly fragmented and devoid of all unified vision. Note to Mr. Zombie: Just because you have lots of swearing doesn't mean you can justify making a 100 minute movie out of a skin deep plot. I just wish insta-directors like Zombie could recognize when they have a thirty minute movie and make a thirty minute movie instead of adding six or seven fight scenes and calling it a feature. Devils Rejects literally played like Zombie was making it up as he went along. Terrible. Right down to the bright white teeth on a filthy psychopath living in squalor. Terrible.

257,rillovickwr4,Zombie's Redemption.,6,12 August 2008,"House Of 1,000 Corpses was entirely different from the sequel. It was a movie about a bunch of oddball psychos who are obsessed with local legends, and necrophilia. The Devil's Rejects is SO much better! It is a lot more believable, as if it could really happen, unlike the first movie which was about stories of hellish, supernatural killers. I would call House Of 1,000 corpses ""Hellraiser For Hill Billy's"". Yes, it's THAT bad. The Devil's Rejects is not THAT good, but a big step towards improvement for director Rob Zombie. The plot in this movie is much more simple, yet much better: INSANITY, TORTURE, AND SWEET REVENGE! The blood and gore is awfully repulsive in this movie, but it's there to show you how sick and twisted these people are. One thing I picked up on is that Captain Spaulding isn't the only hilarious character in this movie. Otis and Baby were both very funny at times. As funny as it is though, it's still a serious movie (and quite sick). And Rob Zombie again wrote most of the soundtrack himself, and the soundtrack is again superb. Overall The Devil's Rejects is quite a symbol of redemption for Mr. Zombie, and was very well done in all aspects compared to House Of 1,000 Corpses.

Roger Ebert gave a scathing review of a movie called CHAOS. I would say that is the reaction I had watching REJECTS. It is a heartless, mindless, offensive, and cruelly empty film that left me feeling the need to take a shower, afterwards. Here is a film that champions the worst society has to offer in the form of a trio of murderous savages and makes the lawman out to be a lunatic not much different than the killers. If REJECTS director, Rob Zombie, truly wants to make the statement that there is no difference between cops and killers then I feel very sorry for him.

263,jamie_likeskylie,Great follow up,8,22 July 2005,"This movie has some classic ingredients for a great horror movie. Interesting characters, some really vile gore scenes, bad language, unnecessary nudity, and some familiar faces; Leslie Easterbrook (from the Police Academy movies), Ken Foree (the original Dawn Of The Dead), 80's pop singer/actress E.G. Daily and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes) provide more than enough nostalgia for retro junkies, like myself.The story isn't overly fast paced but the gore can be thick and pretty relentless and is at times implied rather than shown which I think adds to the experience. I really enjoyed Leslie Easterbrook as Mother Firefly (replacing Karen Black who was in the first movie, House Of 1000 Corpses). She does some wonderful overacting in her scenes, it's a shame she wasn't in it more, same goes for E.G. Daily who plays a sassy hooker. In fact everyone was great in their parts, let's face it this is not Shakespeare - this is a horror movie, I for one demand hammy over the top performances and a bit of camp! I don't want to give anything away but I will say my favourite scenes involved Mother Firefly and the sheriff, and Captain Spaulding and a mother and child. If you enjoyed House Of 1000 Corpses, this is a superior sequel in my mind and you wont be disappointed. If your idea of horror is a glossy PG-13 rated remake you might want to try weaning yourself onto this kind of movie with something a little less extreme.",The Devil's Rejects
264,RolandCPhillips,What a ride.,7,15 November 2005,"I enjoyed this follow up to House of 1000 Corpses in a way that's hard to express without sounding like a total headcase.I've read numerous reviews which complement Rob Zombie for the technical virtuosity he displays here, and that this is a big improvement on 1000 Corpses (which I also liked), but that The Devils Reject's is for people who think Charles Manson were paragons of virtue; messianic seers who symbolise a rich an valuable vein of counter-culture. Hmmmm Straight up, straight down, The Devil's Rejects is extremely violent, gory, sadistic, worrying, profane and seedy. And I loved it. It's hard fast, tough and dealt out with a brio that is hard to find in any cinema, anywhere in the world. Great praise must be directed towards Phil Parmet's tremendous Super 16mm photography, which is grainy and visceral, colourful and gruesome; he transforms the parched landscape into almost surrealist terrain. Anthony Tremblay's production design is also absolutely superb, creating the world of 1970s Texas with great detail: it's really convincing and thus when the characters run around like headless chickens, the art direction makes it look all the more convincing.The film also takes no time to get going: the narrative starts immediately. Five minutes in, we're in the middle of a brutal gun battle, with the beleaguered Firefly family trying to ward off the emissaries of the Texas Rangers in Ned Kelly style armour. Suffice to say, it all goes to hell. Several of the Rejects are killed, and Momma Firefly is captured. Two, however (Otis, and Baby Firefly), make a break and go on the lam, meeting up with the iconic Clown Captain Spalding. Thus the stage is set for the ultimate, hellish road trip, with the three surviving members of the brood trying outwit just about everything the States of Texas has to throw at 'em and the increasingly demented Sheriff Wydell, who is being haunted by his brother, a previous victim of the Rejects.The Firefly Family kill whomever they want to and whenever they please. Meet them, and they'll scrag you before you blink an eye, or after they've tormented with vituperations about haw much of a loser you are, or just torture you. The family has, apparently, amassed a record of MORE THAN A THOUSAND MURDERS. Move over Well, just about ANY serial killer. This family is the ultimate in unmitigated monstrosity and unprovoked murder. They really kill just 'cause they hate everyone  and I mean everyone.Rob Zombie has certainly improved as film-maker since 1000 Corpses: this is a more accomplished, homogeneous, aggressive and accomplished work. It's the work of a real film-maker and it's had to fault his basic nuts-and-bolts assemblage of cinematography, editing, design and music. His frame of reference has also expanded because he riffs on Leone, Peckinpah (specifically The Wild Bunch), Bonnie and Clyde, (maybe) Badlands, as well as the old faves (such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deranged). His narrative also seems to be structured around homage, following famous conflagrations or serial killers: The Alamo, Gacy, Ed Gein, or Anthony Perkins from Psycho.It's quite a ride then  and the soundtrack is a killer: Allmanns, Lynrd Skynrd, Muddy Waters, Otis Rush, Buck Owens to name but a few.However, I can well understand the arguments against the film. Some have argued that Zombie celebrates the Firefly family, seeing them as rebellious, non-conformist and individualistic, who reject any form of suppression. They might be a bit excessive and bonkers, but they're to be supported and followed in their total rejection of any form of authority. I can appreciate how people might see it that way. For one, I didn't always like the actors: I thought the like of Geoffrey Lewis and Ken Forsythe (why isn't this dude more famous  he's almost as cool as Clint!) eclipsed the Firefly Sheri Moon Zombie and the others. They were just more layered and convincing as performers. Also the film is certainly over-balanced in favour of the Fireflies: we never really learn much about their apocalyptic antics prior to what we see in the film, and the forces they're fighting against, such as Sheriff Wydell are straight-lipped Dirty Harry types who basically want to stop the Fireflies mucking about. I certainly didn't think Zombie made the Firefly repellent enough (they are truly evil people) and I think it would have made the film more powerful if the Fireflies were villains rather than ambiguous heroes, since there would have been no-one to root for.But still, I really enjoyed this. It was a real adrenaline rush, always inventive and full of incident. True: it kind of rejoices in a form of evil, but lacks the sophistication to really ram a message like: ""violence and death are cool  go hurt someone!"" Perhaps I should be grateful that Zombie never succeeds in saying something like that, because then I'd need to certified and I'd also probably have been watching a snuff film. Whatever you do, don't take it seriously. Hopefully, R.Z. doesn't want us to take it seriously  just enjoy it like horror aficionados.But this is still and ride to remember.",The Devil's Rejects

266,jmille42,killing with no regard and excessive use of that special four letter word,5,22 July 2005,"Rob Zombie once again tries to quench the American thirst for blood, gore, and mayhem with his follow up to the 2003 sleeper hit House of 1000 Corpses with The Devil's Rejects. The psychotic Firefly family is at it again, killing with no regard and using that special four letter word like it's going out of style. This time Sheriff Wydell, played by William Forsythe, is out to avenge the murder of his brother as he tracks down the three ring leaders of the family on a cross country manhunt.Writer and director Rob Zombie has quite the imagination, bringing all aspects of execution, sex, and religion balled up into one huge fright fest. I'll give credit where credit is due, Zombie does his best with what he is given. Any film these days financed by Lions Gate Entertainment with have to settle for B and C list actors and actresses, which is no more apparent than Zombie casting his own wife, Sherri Moon Zombie, in the female lead as Baby Firefly.I can understand shaky camera movements to symbolize the realism in certain scenes, but Zombie insists on shaking the camera and utilizing extreme close ups a little too much. The grainy 70's looking film stock did not make matters much better, causing blurry effects that took away from some of the detail going into the makeup effects and battle scenes. But Rob has a way of bringing out the most in a scene, whether by music or his now famous violent slow motion shots (If you've seen either movie, you'll know what I'm talking about).Despite a lazy effort, Devil's Rejects is one of those films where you can have fun sitting with your friends on a Friday or Saturday night, hearing the screams and gasps from little teenagers who got their parents' disgruntled permission to see such a disgusting piece of work. It is not as colorful as ""Corpses,"" but the realistic turn may have been for the best as the villains do just enough (most of what you don't see scares you the most) to send that little chill down your spine as the screams and pleas for life reign out through the theater. Since I absolutely hate clowns, Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) takes me back to being scared out of my mind by Tim Curry's portrayal of Pennywise The Clown in Stephen King's IT. What is it about that which scares you the most makes you want to see it even more?",The Devil's Rejects

Yes, there are flaws: continuity errors, lapses of reason, and other inconsistencies. If you're very familiar with Corpses (as I am), you will have some specific questions that will go unanswered; if not, you will simply be confused.That being said, the performances are top-notch (I was not familiar with any of the actors who weren't in the first film but they were excellent nonetheless). I'm also only vaguely familiar with the '70s horror/slasher films that it referenced, but enough so as to ""get it.""The most horrifying and disturbing thing about this movie was the number of young kids in the audience (I'm talking 10 - 12 year-olds). First off, this should never have gotten away with an R rating; it is definitely NC-17 material. And secondly, the under-17 restriction wasn't even enforced (the audience I saw it with was mostly teen boys, some teen girls, a healthy dose of 20- and 30-somethings, and an alarming number of under-17s). The other thing that struck me about the audience is that they didn't seem prepared for what they were about to see (there were many shrieks and gasps, leading me to believe that they hadn't seen the original Corpes to know what they were in for). The other thing that was interesting was that when I saw Corpses, they audience was mostly rooting for the yet-to-be-so-called ""Rejects""; in this one, they were rooting for their victims. Interesting.Bottom line: not for the squeamish, faint of heart, and especially, not for the kiddies.",The Devil's Rejects
269,ericjams,"An Amazing Film, that requires a certain mindset and knowledge to appreciate",9,3 December 2006,"Where to begin? Well Im going to begin with the fact that this a sequel to 1k Corpses that goes in a completely different direction and thus is hardly even comparable to its predecessor. Corpses was first and foremost a freak show set around a very generic plot line (2 couples get stuck in the middle of nowhere....horror occurs). Dialogue was non-existent and actual visual imagery of torture was in my opinion normally only displaying the conclusions (i.e. rather than seeing someone get impaled on a wall, you'd see the person impaled on the wall and covered in blood and dirt). In my opinion, Zombie had a good vision with 1000 Corpses but lacked the directorship and screenplay to make it work. Thus, moving to Devil's Rejects we have a much improved director with a script that removes much of the Gothic/circus like feel of its predecessor and replaces it with a cool cinematographic feel (namely the deep south, creepy backwoods whorehouses and motels). Additionally, Zombie uses color in this movie. Many shots take in the Texas blue sky or barren landscape, it shows he is a director more confident in his ability to fill the screen whereas 1000 corpses was shot in proverbial rain or indoors. I haven't even gotten to the plot or the acting. Sid Haig and Bill Moseley shine. The characters are given a personal dimension. And ultimately, I think what pisses off so many people about this movie is that you either have to root for the serial killers, or walk out of the movie, and that to me is completely awesome. Additionally, what pisses off people is that this is not a straight up psycho/Gothic/devil worshiping gore fest. And again I think that is the beauty of the film. You don't have monsters terrifying people, you have a script that both hoists the family (devil's rejects) up as a true-blue American family, father, mother, sister, brother, love, in-fighting, jokes, partying....Zombie doesn't force home the disturbed underlying nature of the family. Instead he tries as hard as possible to humanize people who are at the deepest level completely morbid. And the certain levels of morbid interplay between the rejects and their victims is far more compelling in my opinion than any type of monster-like cannibalism/torture/insert standard horror gore. For instance when Otis is driving the two band members out to help him fetch guns, there is some dialog between him and his soon to be victims where he outright tells him whats going to happen -- they get the guns, he kills them. This provides a great bit of interplay where the band members are not really able to grasp their impending deaths...this is far more interesting to me than if Otis were to just go out into the desert and slowly torture people, which I think is what some fans of Zombie wanted to see. And of course the violence is there, its just preceded by forced human interaction which almost embodies an anti-social mythos. See, Baby forcing the girls to hit each other, see Otis using weaponry to sexually assault. And of course so much of the movie isn't about the cause but the effects of the rejects. See the police chief's devolution, see the girl running into the highway. I mean the world Zombie creates is not as simple as I think many wish it were. Violence and disturbing human behavior emanate throughout, but its not all obvious, things happen that you don't see coming, and its not all directly related to the Reject's ---and to me that is very cool. Lastly, there is the way Zombie shot many of the scenes in a slow-motion feel. In the DVD interview he pays homage to the old Bonnie and Clyde film as inspiration for the ending to this flick. I think it was fantastic. He tries to offer a new look at gun battles and does so by slowing it all down. And you also have the interesting themes of the movie which I think can be stated as the ""exploration/need to employ evil to fight evil"" Of course the police chief is the vehicle for all of this, but again Zombie does not resort to the standard protagonist/ antagonist roles so often used to support the horror genre. There is no real good/bad in this movie because the supposed good guys end up devolving into equally morbid people. All in all, I think anyone who sees this movie will be shocked, albeit for very different ways. I don't agree with any of the negative reviews on this page. I think most people were eithera) disgusted because the general aura surrounding the reject's family is extremely depraved and can turn many viewers away; b) disappointed because they expected a true-blue horror movie which to many is sadly the same old regurgitated violence/lack of character development/and lack of plot. I for one was overjoyed to have finally watched a movie that makes you squirm, makes you cheer for the killers, and does so with a great soundtrack, and decent cinematographer, this is the horror genre after all. And for all the haters, I will throw you a bone, Sheri-moon zombie, although playfully dumb and thus kinda fitting her role like Keenu Reeves fits so many of his roles, is still out-acted at almost every turn.

House of 1000 Corpses was a Trippe trip through hell and with The Devils Rejects Rob continues that premise. I prefer this film because of the mixture of action and horror the opening scene involves one of the weirdest shootouts in cinema history and the action never lets up. Rob knows how to use the camera and every shot, every frame is done to perfection. The script and story are well crafted and actually quite creative, now just as a warning if you have never seen a Rob Zombie film this one is full of brutal violence, a lot of sex and nudity, and so many cuss words I lost count (For more information on rating check the parents guide). One more thing I want to mention is the cast I thought all of them did really well especially Sid Haig (captain spaulding) and Sherri Moon Zombie that played Spaudings daughter anyway if you love horror, action or Rob Zombies other films or music definitely check this out.",The Devil's Rejects

Most people compare HO1000C to TDR. If you ask me, I'd tell you to knock it off. DON'T COMPARE IT TO THE FIRST MOVIE! THEY ARE TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT MOVIES IN Each other! This movie was A LOT more realistic, and gory/violent. Yet at the same time, it's not quite a horror film as opposed to the first film. Rob Zombie's direction in this movie was more well-done and laid back. As well, it also had more of a mainstream feel to it.House of 1000 Corpses was VERY creepy, and just INSANE. House of 1000 Corpses is also a horror movie, and NOT a gory thriller like TDR. HO1000C was still VERY messed up as well, which is probably one of the reasons why people more prefer the second one over the first which is understandable. Still, I don't think it should be compared, because like I said, it's VERY different than the first.The cast was also more well known in this one as opposed to the first, which is also why I think this one is more mainstream, while the second one was more underground than this one.Bottom Line - 10/10, Amazing performance, amazing direction, and thrilling throughout.

273,DevilPaul,Really Disappointed With This Storyline.,3,11 October 2006,"I can't remember being so bored and disgusted during a movie in a long time. ""The Devil's Rejects"" picks up where ""House of 1000 Corpses"" left off and the family finds themselves under the assault of the local police in a shoot out right at the beginning. The assault is led by Sheriff Wydell who happens to be the brother of another Wydell killed by the family in the first movie. Mother Firefly is arrested but Otis and Baby escape the shoot out and are soon joined by Captain Spaulding at a seedy motel after they take a traveling band hostage. Then the movie takes great pains to show us how depraved these people are. They torture and humiliate their hostages just because they can. Why? I don't know, perhaps there is a point to it in the end. After they finish with the hostages Captain Spaulding takes them to his brother Charlie's whore house while Sheriff Wydell tortures Mother Firefly back at the police station. Do you remember Billy Dee Williams' ""Lando Calrissian"" character in ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back""? Well that's exactly what Charlie is: a businessman under threat by a higher authority to give up his friends in order to save his own ass. That's what he does and Wydell get Spaulding, Otis, and Baby with the help of two hired thugs. From there on, Wydell pretty much exhibits the same respect for the trio as they do for their hostages. I'm not saying who wins or loses but in the end the audience is treated to the entire Lynryd Skynyrd ""Freebird"" song to some slow motion bloodshed.What can I say? This is about the most pointless movie I've ever seen. As an audience, we don't empathize with Baby, Spaulding, or Otis at all. We think they are disgusting and morally depraved but there is no answer as to why we should even care about them which is essential for keeping the audience emotionally involved in the story. During the humorous parts I couldn't even laugh because the characters were just people that I hated. I kept thinking, ""I hope someone puts a bullet in all three of their skulls soon. I don't know how much longer I can watch this."" I felt as tortured as their victims since I was essentially watching an hour and a half of three people who I hated from the beginning. In ""House of 1000 Corpses"" I really liked Sid Haig's ""Captain Spaulding"" character and thought he was the high point of the movie. In ""Devil's Rejects"" I couldn't stand him. If you've seen Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" then you've seen ""The Devil's Rejects"" except that in this movie the characters aren't really that entertaining.Seeing how bad this movie was is a shock since I liked ""House of 1000 Corpses"" even though it was a little rough around the edges. I expected, coming into this film, that Rob Zombie would have honed his craft and whip up something even better than his previous effort. The truth is that his new film is much, MUCH worse than I could have possibly imagined.Folks, this ain't even worth a rental!",The Devil's Rejects

Not far behind is Sheriff Wydell, whose thirst for revenge for his brother's death is unquenchable. Needless to say, many people are going to get hurt and at least someone is going to die.In comparison with 2003's House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects far outshines its older brother. Zombie nailed the grind-house/exploitation feeling and photography of the 1970s, but adding a uniqueness in his own right. The movie references are interspersed throughout, noting everything from Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Groucho Marx. The script, again by Zombie, provides more nuance than what is expected for this type of fair.

A man who strongly believes in the 'eye for an eye' saying, he will stop at nothing until he's found the Firefly family - dead or alive.Devil's Rejects is no way near as trippy as House of 1000 Corpses, Dr. Satan goes by the wayside and while House seems to play on the audiences fear of the unknown supernatural, Rejects seems to have a whole new take on what is scary - relentless torture, done in a matter-of-fact way.Bill Mosely as in House is fantastic and this time, having made Sheri Moon his wife, Zombie gives her a bigger and more powerful part in Devil's Rejects and she doesn't fail to give possibly one of the most deranged performances of last year.Devil's Rejects is not as 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre' as House of 1000 Corpses, and this being his second film Rob Zombie has learnt how to terrify an audience, but at the same time offers some dark, clever humour and brilliantly juxtaposed music that makes Devil's Rejects one hell of a cool horror film, that I recommend to anyone with a strong stomach.",The Devil's Rejects

This film is the continuing story of the sadistic Firefly family. The movie does a good job establishing what kind of film it wants to be. The film opens up with the Firefly house being ambushed by a police squad led by Sheriff Wydell (a brother to one of the victims in the first film). Wydell is obsessed with capturing and punishing the killers and takes the law into his own hands. Meanwhile, the Firefly family (consisting of Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding) leave a bloody trail of carnage in their wake. The movie is way more violent than the first film and is a little bit disturbing. This was a good horror/road movie. The Devil's Rejects has a great southern rock soundtrack and good camera work that add to the '70s film aspect. The film is original with a good story and memorable characters.

The film is about the Firefly family being hunted down by a Sheriff whose brother was killed by them in the first film. The Characters all return Captain Spaulding, Baby, Otis, Mother Firefly and Tiny are all here (some are played by different actors) although Tiny's screen time is limited and Mother Firefly spends most of the film behind bars. But this doesn't mean that the film isn't fun because the remaining killers are the best of the bunch which is why i think Director Rob Zombie gave them the leads.The film is a mix of 3 genres horror, western and comedy. And believe me the comedy is totally hilarious from Baby's little songs (Chinese, Japanese, dirty knees, look at these!) to chicken sex (you'll see what i mean). Meanwhile the horror is really brutal and sometimes uncomfortable to watch even for the most hardened horror fan like myself. People get shot, stabbed and beaten to death and this may seem like the same old deaths in every horror film but the cheery music that accompanies these scenes have a strong effect which i can't describe.Finally the ending i'm not going to spoil it for you but when the Sheriff catches the three runaways i couldn't help but feel sorry for them!

To those saying it's disgusting and pointless and offensive, that IS the point. To those complaining that there's no plot, especially the dude who's mad because there's no ""heroes"", who said a movie has to have heroes?

The Devil's Rejects takes those excellent characters (Bill Moseley's Otis is one of my favorite movie characters - he's such a damn good actor. Sid Haig is pretty great as well.) and follows them on their journey with, again, excellent camera work and soundtrack (Midnight Rider in the title sequence? Legendary).

His rogue justice got himself killed. Now yes in the end the bad guys were eradicated but at what cost? Officers lost and the justice system was made a shambles of. A sheriff can't go into a holding cell and kill a woman when by law it is not allowed. There is no real justice in this and there was no real justice in what he tried to do later in the movie.Also it is clear thought was given to how this movie played out as the soundtrack to it is one of the best ever and there was irony created when certain songs were played after certain events. I applaud Rob Zombie and whoever else was involved for getting this so right.I also was thrilled with the way that the Rob Zombie wrote in light moments and showed that this family of killers still had the capability of enjoying some of the smaller things in life and also of course would die for each other. The point is killers were once kids and many killers are just like you and me but they made decisions for whatever reason that put them on the other side of the law. Yes there are killers out there with no conscience but there are many more that are more like you and I. William Forsythe did an excellent job playing Sheriff Wydell. His character's strong will to see justice done whether it be done right or wrong was brought out strongly on screen. He should be very please with his performance in this role.Leslie Eileen Easterbrook as Gloria ""Mother"" Firefly. She didn't over act like some would have in some of the scenes she was in and she just seemed so naturally able to convey how depraved an individual her character was. A tremendous performance throughout her entire time on screen.I think with all the positives I have shared I will give this movie the highest rating I can give a movie that is not a classic all time great movie and that is a 7 so others might rate this even higher. I think the content makes one, including me, rate it lower than maybe it should be rated. I openly admit that. However then again there wasn't any tremendous dialogue in this movie that made you say wow and there were not those wow moments where you felt you hadn't seen this before so maybe my rating at 7 is right.Anyway this movie was recommended by my brother for me to watch at some point and I am glad I rented it because it definitely was entertaining even if at times my stomach turned a bit early on.",The Devil's Rejects

285,The_Eighth_Passenger,Provocative film with questionable politics,7,12 May 2013,"Rob Zombie launched himself onto the main stage as an important voice in modern horror with his sophomore effort The Devil's Rejects. Continuing the exploits of the Firefly family, last seen in House of 1000 Corpses, the film follows the family on the run after a police raid on their den of torture and murder. The local Sheriff has a personal grudge to settle and as the film develops we are asked to side with the family as they become the victims.Zombie's influences are clear from the outset with an opening narration and on screen text in the style of a documentary giving the back story in a clear reference to Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The 70's setting and overall style of the film constantly hearkens back to genre classics such as Craven's Last House On The Left. The film never reaches the artistic heights of Chainsaw (partially due to a sexually juvenile and leery tone that undermines the other great work being done) but it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the vast majority of grindhouse movies. There are many who accuse Zombie of being a Charles Manson sympathiser and it is easy to see why. The character of Otis, played by Bill Mosely, is clearly based on the most famous of mass murderers and I don't think it's a push to look at it as a homage. Zombie is clearly more interested in his killers than their victims, as he would go on to confirm in his remake of Halloween in which he made Michael Myers' inner psyche the central focus. Being encouraged to sympathise with killers as sadistic and brutal as the Firefly family in The Devil's Rejects doesn't work for me and I am constantly on the side of Sheriff Wydell. Obviously each viewer will bring their own personal politics and baggage with them and is free to form their own opinions but personally once I have witnessed a man rape a woman with a pistol I don't care how much he may love his sister, I look forward to his painful demise.Whatever Zombie's agenda and wherever his sympathies lie, there is no denying he has made a powerful film and any movie that can get people debating about these issues has got to be doing something right.It is astonishing, given the violence being portrayed, how many times I burst out laughing watching the film. From Sid Haig as father figure Captain Spaulding to Ken Foree as a pimp, the film is full of great character actors and genre favourites turning it up to 11 and spitting out Zombie's hilarious, twisted dialogue with relish.

This film is even more aimed at 70's TV and especially 70's horrorflicks. So that basically means; the acting is horrible at times, the script is hilarious, but the atmosphere is utmost campy and plain genius! The film is shot with warm and dusty images and old-skool editing (i.e: screen sliding to the left between scenes). These kind of things really give the film a great atmosphere, and the soundtrack only makes that atmosphere complete. And I haven't even mentioned some of the hilarious quotes this film features. Especially the Firefly-family have some of the most crazy and funny (although most of the time sadistic) lines ever.Don't expect any brainfood or anything, just good old horror-entertainment like it should be. There is still plenty of violence and gore to keep true horrorfans satisfied, although I thought it wasn't as gory as the first film House of 1000 Corpses. To me, this film is a tribute to old horrorfilms, but also a inspiration for modern horror-directors! Rob Zombie is definitely on the right track with his movies, and I can't wait to finally see his Halloween-movie. If he captures the atmosphere as good as in this movie, he can't possibly go wrong I think. The only small minor thing I can come up with in this movie has got to be sheriff John Wydell who gets a little bit annoying with this 'hand of god'-like attitude he seems to be developing throughout the film.This is definitely a must-have for hardcore and oldskool horrorfans, but also for moviewatchers who want to try a different kind of (horror)movie for a change.

Even bare breasts couldn't save this movie.I don't expect reality in my horror movies, but I expect to be able to stretch my disbelief to accommodate the unreality of the setting. The characters were so far out that no one could believe them.There was no story line. I know, the sheriff was supposed to be going insane from grief for his brother, but that was not apparent enough.No law enforcement agency would allow the brother of a slain officer to be involved in hunting the brother's killers. The Flying Spaghetti Monster knows I have no love for Texas, but the Texas Rangers have a reputation approaching the RCMP. They would never allow the sheriff to get involved in the hunt.I could go on about the interstate nature of the killings, the weapons, etc. but I won't.This wasn't a horror movie so much as a gross out festival. ""Let's see how much we can gross out our viewers"" I wasn't grossed out so much as I was annoyed by anyone expecting me to buy the reality of the story.I don't buy it.

You get to see how they are after the last movie. It's kind of sad that Otis forgot to shave and sleeps in a crib, but then they all dress up in armor and move on with they're lives!You will learn a lot of important things in this movie, like how Captain Spaulding can impress fat girls with his commercial about a monkey in a cute white dress and pearl necklace, and even though they're grown-ups, Baby and Otis still fight in the car about if they should stop for ice cream or not.Also, you should also not play banjos or you are asking for trouble.There's this part where some old guy is telling Otis about bunnies in springtime, but no one gets to wear a rabbit costume in this one :(It was pretty sad to see how PeeWee Herman's girlfriend lost her job at that bike store, so she turned into this gross old stripper instead. The sheriff kind of rips off that line about taking a picture so it'll last longer, but it's nice how he pins photos on people so they don't get lost.

292,yodaccm,Not the best I've seen...,5,24 October 2006,"I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting when I rented this movie. I had seen the first movie on cable and thought it was interesting, and had a good sense of style, really gritty. And this one looked even grittier, with a focus more grounded in reality. But I found it predictable and unsatisfying. The killers weren't really that great, pretty standard in their approach (the girl was actually pretty annoying, the brother could have been creepy, but how many times do I have to hear a killer denounce god as reason for his insanity) Captain Spaulding could have been interesting, but he didn't DO anything. He shows up after all the bad stuff has occurred. And when the cop finally captures them and didn't kill them immediately, you knew he wasn't going to be able to finish his revenge. It would have been better, in my opinion, if he just, in cold blood, finished them off as soon as possible. That would have been pretty shocking, in my opinion. Instead, they get away until they are gunned down by a police roadblock; who didn't see that coming? I wasn't sure if we should be rooting for the bad guys or what? If we weren't, then why have ""touching"" scenes with the killers discussing whether to get ice cream, or the gung-ho way they decide to go out? I suppose the reality of such violence isn't always so cut and dry, but if I want that reality, I'll just pick up a newspaper.

293,Bataeu,Great film...!!!,10,13 October 2005,"Never have I walked out of a movie feeling satisfied and smiling maniacally! This movie was even higher than my expectations. I expected a full out bloodfest of murder and violence. Instead I was greeted by one of the most intelligent, well acted, well written films I have seen in a LONG time. Basic plot, Sheriff Wydell, brother of George Wydell (who met his fate in House of 1,000 Corpses), plots revenge on Baby, Otis and Captain Spaulding. The film opens in a shoot out between the sadistic family and the police, which Wydell is leading. Baby and Otis escape the police and seek help from Captain Spaulding (Baby's father). Meanwhile Wydell hires two hit men to take out the pack of murderers, and ends up becoming more twisted than the family themselves. Yes, the family is sick, sadistic and loathsome, but you end up rooting for them. This film glorifies the murderers. You end up on their side, hoping that they get away from the police, that somehow they make it. Sherry Moon Zombie plays Baby deliciously evil, and I ended up liking her character the best. She plays with people and degrades them all in fun. As most would've already figured out in House of 1,000 Corpses, Baby plays with her victims and gets all cute before she unloads a can of whoop-ass on them. Sid Haig is brilliant as Spaulding. I can't imagine anyone else playing his role. He has some of the best one liners in the film. And last, and most definitely not least, Bill Mosely plays Otis so well, you believe he really is insane. If you want to see a confronting, but well written/acted film, then look no further. This is possibly the best movie you could see this year. I am going to give it a solid 10/10 and recommend it to everyone! It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're sick of the same old formulaic killer thrillers, this film is for you.",The Devil's Rejects

297,Fodleg,Wow. What an amazing horror film.,9,30 September 2005,"OMG. This film was amazing. Rob Zombie has really come into his own with ""The Devil's Rejects"". His first effort, ""House of 1000 Corpses"" had initiative and promise, but lacked what TDR has: A visceral, empathetic flurry of alt-art-horror that encapsulates the viewer, whether they like it or not, from beginning to end. William Forsythe really made the film what it is, his savior/devil-slayer character was perfect, performed with precise rigor and fanaticism. The thing I enjoyed the most was the southern music soundtrack so beautifully accompanied to the select scenes of torture, death and torment. I really felt the plight of *all* of the characters (even though I would have liked to have been exposed to the reasons for the Devil's Rejects state of self-destruction and chaos). All in all I think Mr. Zombie made an excellent film and hope his next can hold a candle to this one..",The Devil's Rejects

Rob Zombie does not disappoint with this depraved masterpiece. Crazy bloody violence runs wild. What makes Rob Zombie a rock star of horror is how real his characters seem. They are down right unsettling. Writing is so kick butt. I know what I know and I know I don't like that nut sack. This is no movie to people that cant stand all out brutal horror. What you don't wanna miss is great acting writing with outlandish violence. The Devil's Rejects was one I missed until now. Glad I watched this movie. Watch for the gore stay for the story.

299,Mattissimplythebest,Hardcore Horror Fans Beware,1,8 August 2005,"Having been exposed to a large number of horror flicks since the age of 11 (sorry mum) I have to say that this one looked as though it might deliver something from the trailer. Whilst it did, it has to be said that the delivery started off short of disappointment then accelerated at top speed into a niche I reserve only for the very worst films.From the start we are presented with a scenario that looks exciting, a bunch of murderous killers are penned up in a house of terror, surrounded by the cops. Each has large amounts of weaponry, and thus the duke out begins in spectacular fashion - and thats only the first few minutes. However, from the very second that anyone speaks the idea that this will be anything other than feeble disintegrates. Though consistent the dialogue is awful and so overblown with expletives that even Eddie Murphy would have been appalled.The narrative plot is so simplified that an infant could follow the pattern from a to b to c, and therefore malicious laughter followed by boredom ensues from the predictability. What makes classics like Halloween (the first one only) great is that it has that Hitcockian psychological edge to it whilst playing on a theme that obeys its own rules (i.e. virgins survive, sex kittens get slaughtered). When looking at this film the idea that an average looking yak like Otis could be smacked over the head with a heavy plank and still get up is laughable, whilst the idea that Michael Myers could survive being shot and stabbed merely heightens its supernatural element.Many times we come across fans who see a director take an extreme stance on dialogue and violence and they see it as genius. Whilst the ability to say and do what no one else will counts for artistic integrity, what this film does is to substitute language for style. As a result the hardcore 18 certificate quality of the film is taken to the edge and then over, but with no real authority. There is not a single ounce of creative direction here, and all the various techniques that are used to either slow down time, or create euphoric drug overdose lighting effects appear to be thrown in haphazardly without any thought process. This is a film that cannot be taken seriously if it is to be enjoyed, and sincerely I had some enjoyment from picking apart the narrative from start to finish; however I will never have the inclinitation to watch this in any form again, it is quite simply that poor.",The Devil's Rejects
300,TheFilmProf,Rejected by Satan...and with good reason.,1,6 June 2006,"To say that Rob Zombie's film, ""The Devil's Rejects"", is not for everyone would be an understatement. In truth, it's for the very few. Those who will find it worth viewing are most likely already devotees of Mr. Zombie and his former metal band, White Zombies.With a trite scenario and a visual style that hails from the 1970s, including ineffective and outdated freeze frames, ""The Devil's Rejects"" offers up a mixture of grotesquerie and gore with a hint of sado-sexual depravity, but little else. And despite failed attempts at infusing some comic relief, the film is ultimately, and overwhelmingly, exceedingly violent, and even worse, clichéd. From the outset, it's hard to tell just what, if anything, this film is trying to say. Whether Mr. Zombie is speaking out against violence, glorifying it, or merely pointing out its existence, just isn't clear.The premise is simple enough. The Rejects, still on the loose after Zombie's last--and even worse--film, ""House of 1000 Corpses"", are besieged by the police in the opening scene, but, as you might expect, they manage to escape, which sets the stage for the killing sprees to come.Pretentious and ponderous, the film fails to seriously look at the moral oppositions of right and wrong, good and evil, justice and revenge. While those themes are there, they're superficially played out in a context that's a mile wide and an inch deep. By failing to examine these contrasting forces in any meaningful way, the film becomes little more than a pretext for putting mayhem up on the screen without any solid justification. Hackneyed visual metaphors and hideous looking characters simply aren't enough to sustain the importance of the argument that the film ineffectively proffers as its central topic. Somewhere there has to be a deeper probing into the underlying causes of such evil manifestations as well as some plausible offerings of solutions. ""The Devil's Rejects"" lacks in those respects. The idea that Sheriff Wydell's (William Forsythe) motivation stems from the fact that the Fireflies killed his fellow police officer brother is hardly new or effective, nor is his skewed sense of morality and justice--both of which take a back seat to blind vengeance and retribution.Giving him some benefit of doubt, I think that Mr. Zombie believes that he's made a worthy film. But the problem is that beyond the visual viscera and grotesquerie, he doesn't provide much else. This film has no depth and no character. Nor is there any suspense since we know from the start how every scene will ultimately end--with more bodies. What the film lacks is an essential philosophy or set of guiding principles that serve to explain, or at the very least rationalize, such human depravity.Surprisingly, beyond the base, ignoble and sadistic exterior there are some perceptibly good performances, although they're fettered with head-shakingly shallow dialogue and a pedestrian screenplay which makes them well-nigh impossible to discern. Bill Moseley gives some hints of talent as the heinous cult leader, Otis, though much of it gets lost in the video style editing and far too many close-ups for a cinematic format. And Geoffrey Lewis, a great character actor whose name you may not recognize, but whose face you surely will, is equally short-changed. And short-lived as well.On the up side, there's a good sound track, even if it does seem a bit out of place, and incapable of redeeming this amateurish film. Blind Willie Johnson, Otis Rush, Joe Walsh, Steely Dan, Muddy Waters, The Allman Brothersthey're all there, as is Lynard Skynard, whose ""Freebird"" backs up the obligatory scene where the Rejects, in a barrage of gunfire, are finally, and thankfully, blasted into hell.Somebody say ""Amen."" © 2005",The Devil's Rejects
301,sancticus,Quite respectable follow up.,6,8 October 2005,"The crazy family is back, and in this sequel to House of a 1000 corpses you are in for some nasty, vicious, bloody and very graphic scenes of violence. So if this is not your cup of tea I would advice you find something else to watch. The overall feel of the movie is quite similar to the first one. We get back into the action as the police catches up with the ""lovely"" family. From there on it's pretty much a game of cat and mice with a lot of blood in between. In that lies the problem of the movie. Since we already explored the characters and the redneck surroundings in the first movie this one has not much new to bring to the plate. The shape of things to come later in the movie is also quite a bit obvious from and early stage (3-4 min)But that aside it's still a excellent horror movie. The cast is great and so is their acting. Some of the sequences is also lovely shot. Rob Zombie uses strictly music for some scenes (no audio) to create a counterpoint to the action on the screen. Much like ""Last house on the left"" ""Cannibal holocaust"" and other classics. He steals heavily from all those genre movies from before but he does it well and with his own stamp. And the final scene is pure art.

All that there is to do for them is to cause mayhem, and boy, does Mr. Zombie like to drag out his mayhem to uncomfortable levels.Lionsgate asked Zombie to do a sequel and he obliged. I don't know why people prefer this boring, unimaginative trek through the desert over the previous film, because it never once feels like any of this was ever planned. It's an endless cycle of go here, things gets messed up. Escape here, then things gets messed up.  That's just what they do! They're the Firefly clan!

303,blakndn,I saw the free screening too....,8,2 July 2005,"...and felt that the guy who had a problem with the movie, (although he liked the first movie) hadn't really seen a lot of depraved films. (by the way, I was the woman in the back cheering ""Cannibal Holocaust"", because that sh#t is wrong--lol).Personally I think House of 1000 Corpse sucked, because it was too cartoonish, and Rob Z. admitted as much. In fact, House of 1000 C's only got interesting for me when they found all those bodies in the basement, and that demon-looking thing tied to a post. Now that should've been the movie! I really didn't like the characters reprising their roles in Devil's Rejects because they left a sour taste in my mouth from the first movie. However, unlike the victims in the 1st movie (who you don't care about), the victims in this version are so sympathetic, that you really want the Firefly family to be killed (especially Baby. I really wanted her to suffer. Strangely, I wanted Captain Spalding to repent. He seemed like he could redeem himself...but alas, sniff... it wasn't meant to be).I told my husband (who saw it with me) that I wasn't really invested in this movie as I wanted to be, but as I thought about it later, I realized, this is actually a good movie. And that friggin' SOUNDTRACK! I have to buy that music. The 70's feel of the photography mixed with a killer soundtrack of Lynard Skynard, the Altman Brothers, et al. I'm a black woman, and that music gave a wonderful southern subtext to the action on the screen. In fact, it really made me afraid of Texas backwater rednecks. I would not want to meet those folks at a one pump gas station in the middle of nowhere. (This coming from someone who lives in the heart of South Central!) I would advise people to see this movie with an open mind. As Rob Z. said, he views it as his version of Bonnie and Clyde rather than The Texas chainsaw massacre.SPOILER ALERT************ The scene where the woman escapes from the motel and you think she will survive, but then she gets hit by a semi-truck-- that has got to be the most realistic human road kill I have ever seen. In fact, I'm on my way now to Dark Delicacies Bookstore in Burbank. They are giving away limited supplies of free Devil's Rejects posters.

310,shahkaal,Shahkaal says - Undead on Arrival,4,27 July 2005,"The best that can be said about the Devil's Rejects is that it is better than House of a 1000 Corpses. The bad news is that it is a very forgettable and derivative movie that looks like it has been made by .... a zombie.Amazingly, the film is saved by some very good acting by Sid Haig (who dominates every scene he is in) and William Forsythe (amazingly good as always), and by two technically superb sequences (editing & cinematography) in the absolute beginning and end that play like very well-made music videos - set beautifully to 70's classic Southern rock - but nothing that we have not seen on MTV and VH1 before.I saw it in the theater on a Monday with other 15 people, about 5 of whom walked out midway after indicating extreme boredom. The ting is that apart from these two sequences, the rest of the film is very ordinary. Just like House of 100 Corpses, the director continues his admirable effort to reprise 70's classic horror and western movies, but fails to create any subconscious fear in the audience or break any new ground. The problem is that with all the gore on the screen - nothing more goes on in your mind. You carry away a vague disgust but the film inspires no underlying fear or horror unlike most of the films that inspired this effort.Bill Mosely has a very one dimensional role and is not able to do as much with it as he did in the first film. Interesting characters like Tiny and Mother Firefly are also quite cruelly ignored. Ken Foree and many other horror legends that feature in the film sadly also have very forgettable roles - very sad considering how rarely these great actors are seen on screen these days. Special mention must be made of Sherri Moon who does the impossible and is actually worse in this movie than in the first one.The standouts are Sid Haig as Captain Spalding and William Forsythe as the Sheriff (reprising a Dennis Hopper role from one of the Texas Chainsaw films) - both actors who manage to outshine the material that they are given to work with and create some amazing moments on the screen. They almost save the film but the lack of pacing, themes, suspense or anything new in horror make this film sleep the sleep of the undead.Along with his apparent heroes - Wes Craven, Sam Peckinpak, Arthur Penn, and Tobe Hooper - Mr Zombie should spend a little more time on Hitchcock, Polanski, Romero and DePalma so that he can appreciate the elements of suspense as he preps for his next project!",The Devil's Rejects
311,kylekool150,I think some people missed the point.... (CONTAINING MILD SPOILERS),8,23 March 2007,"This movie is suppose to be gritty, it's suppose to be disgusting, it's suppose to be demented, it's suppose to have a big cast of crazy zany characters, this is what Rob Zombie is aiming for. This is one of the movies you have to give a chance, sure it's not for everyone, but just sit through the whole thing even if it disgusts you, it's still worth seeing if you're into this form of a slasher film or not, and if you aren't, then that's fine, but I'm just saying you should have the right to judge it the way you want if you watch it first, but if not, then you don't know which directions this movie could take.I found this movie thoroughly good, Rob Zombie brings no mercy to the slasher genre as this throwback to the 70's gory cheesy horror flicks we came to love grosses out audiences and flops at the box office. I don't think Rob Zombie is one of those film-makers who cares about the money, or the fame, I don't think he could ever expect that from such a misunderstood violent chiller.I'll get on with the review now. It starts off as we get to know a disturbing argumentative firefly family, on the run from a Sheriff, hunting them down with no mercy, after they kill the Sheriff's brother in a firefight. Three of the family members, Captain Spaulding, the nutty domestically disturbing clown, Babe, the immature(psychopathic twisted) killer who'd rather watch the telly then help Otis's plans, Otis, the uptight one who started it all. We see little family moments here and there, although I wouldn't call them family moments because they are merely just cuss-filled arguments that seem to get annoying near the end of the film.As The Pacing in the film picks up, we get all the character depth over with and get serious, as they are REALLY on the run from the sheriff now, and they go on rampaging killing spree's, seemingly passing the time, while enjoying it every step of the way. I don't want to give anymore spoilers now, so see for yourself.All in all, not anything revolutionary to the slasher genre, but not much different then an average slasher film, but it is nonetheless entirely overrated.

I thought rob zombie was some kind of devil worshiping maniac. when I seen the title of the movie ""devils rejects"" I thought to myself that it would be against my religion and evil to watch this movie. after many positive reviews and really getting into all horror type of movies, I decided to watch this movie and figured out the movie would really be demented. right from the beginning of the movie the action starts right away and gets you into the movie. there is a lot of action but not so much that there is too much or doesn't give you any time to relax. house of 1000 corpses takes place right at their country house, while devils rejects actually takes these characters out of their element. you learn a lot about the characters and I must admit that captain spaulding is really entertaining and does things a lot of people would love to do but never will because it is a little too much. you learn a lot about the family and you are shown that even though they are violent weirdos that they still care for each other. I was never a rob zombie fan until this movie. I seen this movie before house of 1000 corpses and I think it actually made it better. overall this is a good action packed movie that had some hint of comedy. I think it is a great movie and is worth watching at least once. the movie is entertaining and there are no boring parts at all.",The Devil's Rejects
313,gautamajovi_95,Hilarious and Insane!,8,27 August 2010,"What a wild ride! The Devil's Rejects is probably the most fun I've ever had watching a film, not only because some of my favorite actors and characters were back but also because there were new characters and actors introduced, all of them fighting for being the craziest.1) What a friggin brilliant use of country and southern rock! Skynyrd Nation forever! 2) Bill Moseley, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon Zombie.3) ""The impure relations with chicken scene"" 4) The hand-held documentary-style cinematography 5) Bill Moseley's constant fights with Sheri 6) Banjo and Sullivan 7) The Last Five Minutes Forty Five Seconds Of The Film! 8) The Intensity of the Torture scenes! In short, the whole freaking film! Rob Zombie has proved himself once again and is now in the list of top horror directors.Just can't talk enough about this film , one of my favorites and one of the best films of 2005!",The Devil's Rejects
314,firetop14,"Sick, twisted and utterly brilliant",8,12 June 2008,"But leave your moral values at the door for this one, this film is definitely not for everyone and many will be unable to see past the depravity (which is plentiful). Let me put it this way; if you're one of those people who read 'Paradise Lost' and fell in love with the character of Satan, then this film runs along similar lines.The film opens with the 'Devil's Rejects' holed up in their house, surrounded by the police and with no obvious way out. A shoot-out quickly follows with casualties on both sides, and those that escape hit the road in search of refuge and slaughter, not necessarily in that order. Hot on their trail is Sheriff Wydell (an excellent performance by William Forsythe) who has a personal stake in the capture of this cheery family of serial killers.Despite what this might imply, this film has no good guys, a fact that forces the viewer to sympathise with the most likable characters around: the Rejects themselves. At total twist of perspective near the end of the film may leave even the most outraged viewers reeling and unsure of which direction they want the film to go.To lighten up the whole grisly affair, Zombie throws in a fair amount of humour, some of it dark and some of it surprisingly innocent, all of it hilarious.An outstanding horror film that looks the devil in the eye and smiles.",The Devil's Rejects
315,keithw1975,Worth Seeing...,7,24 July 2005,"I almost passed on this since I wasn't a big fan of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or House of 1,000 Corpses. They seemed rather ridiculous and flawed to me but of those House of 1,000 seemed better so I gave this one a shot. The show wasn't as gory as I was led to believe, it was only gory to the necessary extent and wasn't overboard. One of the big surprises is that I found myself laughing several times at the verbal exchanges the bad guys had, such as the discussion about the ice cream. There were very few things that seemed outlandish or unbelievable compared to most movies of this type. It actually seemed like it was realistic and believable and had great characters. The bad guys could act as normal as anyone walking down the street except that they didn't mind torturing or killing someone.",The Devil's Rejects
316,jaijaijai73,Badass brutal roller-coaster ride with surprising subtlety,9,16 November 2005,"I had no idea what to expect from this film, but the poster looked good. Man, was I in for a treat! This film rocked like few others ever have. Brutal, sick, twisted, ultra-violent, sadistic, and transgressive don't cover it. It manages to pull off a really dark and intense emotional tone while being truly funny in spots. The cinematography is masterful, putting the viewer in this gritty '70's Texas world of inbred psychopaths and over-the-top cops perfectly. Everything works so well- the props, costumes, set design, camera-work... You forget you're watching a movie. The heinous nature of the family's crimes keeps a wall between them and the viewer. You don't _really_ want to identify with mass murderers, do you? But the characters are so full of charisma that you do want to. That's my one minor complaint about this movie. I don't think that real-life mass-murdering psychopaths would be this much fun, actually. But that's the only criticism I could come up with, and that was way after the fact. Watching the movie, I was just having sick, uncomfortable fun.The soundtrack is great. For a movie that's total Satanic death-metal in character to be powered by southern rock is classic. Play Freebird, man! And somehow it works. The casting is brilliant, the writing is great, everything in this film just works so well. Rob Zombie is the man! I don't know what this film is exactly, as it's way deeper and more character-driven than a horror film. It's not an exploitation film, exactly. It's something uniquely American, I think- a total antihero piece with no good guys in sight. The only good guys in the whole movie are pathetic, and get carved up in various ways pretty quickly. Message? I don't know, maybe the message is that the world ain't a real nice place, but there's no morality play here. Everybody just is what they are, battling for blood-spattered survival. Ultimately, for me at least, the film was provoking emotionally and intellectually, but first and foremost, it's one hell of a wild ride. Must see if you are at all a fan of violence and insanity in your movies.",The Devil's Rejects
317,toffeedragon-3,Violent but mostly pointless.,4,7 July 2006,"I thought that this movie had some good cinematography and a dusty washed out feel that has been done before but still lends the right atmosphere for this kind of violent horror.However, there is minimal plot although we do discover that the psychos murdered the Sheriff's brother which has made him hell bent on revenge. It would have been nice to have some background as to why this family of killers is on such a random violent killing spree and where they are trying to go.There is also a scene in which one of the killers (sorry but his name didn't stick in my memory) takes two men to a deserted place where he has buried guns. He ends up killing the two men but returns to the others without the guns and they don't ask him where they are as they are too busy torturing a woman for absolutely no reason.Another unexplained scene is at the end when some deformed bloke arrives in time to save them from the sheriff. Who is he and why did he walk into the burning house?I watched this film to the end but I would not watch it again for the following reasons:1) No real plot 2) No character development 3) There is not one character that you care about 4) The dialogue was poor 5) Violence for the sake of violenceI don't mind violence if it is integral to the plot or if it is even scary such as in Hitchcock's Psycho. This film is neither thrilling or scary and feels like the director had a bunch of ideas that he wanted in the movie and everything else must fit around it. Even the title has no meaning but Rob Zombie probably just thought it sounded cool.Overall, this is by no means the worst film I have seen recently (that honour is solely reserved for Bar-Be-Q)but falls into the category of very average.",The Devil's Rejects
318,ratblast-1,horror ? where is any horror in this film,5,24 July 2005,I'm sorry rob Zombie but i feel this film is lacking any real horror. in fact it really felt quite toned down compared to house of 1000 corpses. i was expecting way more action and good old killing but wound up with a few good moments and some humor. i feel from dusk till dawn had way more blood and guts with a much faster pace along with horror. * spoiler * the movie starts with a bunch of cops surrounding the house forcing the rejects to shoot their way out. once away from the police they victimize 4 people in a hotel. after that the devils rejects spent 50% of the movie being brutalized by a cop instead of the expected tormenting of the usual victims as seen in house of 1000 corpses.* end of spoiler *the movie has no dark horror elements and really is just a bunch of not so well shown gun fights. disappointing 5 out of 10,The Devil's Rejects
319,vdecaire,"A dizzying homage to Zombie's undying love of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".",7,15 August 2008,"Okay...Hat's off to Rob Zombie (Robert Cummings), the music video producer and lyricist and guitarist for ""White Zombie""- a band that found it's way to Guitar Hero III and slithered it's way into popular culture- for going from a subversive 'music guy' to film director. I know a few music video directors who have gone from that tediously novice job to director, Michael Gondry, Spike Jonze, etc. However I've never seen one who has maintained the look and atmosphere of a supposedly grainy, 70's style video in film. And we've all seen the psychedelic additions of computer effects from the editorial room, but literally Zombie has created something here that modern cinema craved. I tell you this from every inch of me: NO KIDS. This will make you sick. I'm no fan of violence as much as everyone, however I seem impervious to the 'walking out' factor, at least more then most. This is a dizzying array of cold, dark blackness and bright burning carnage. It is an angry film, if I may. Isn't that what you'd describe his music as? It's a homage to 70's style horror, except for the addition of extra gore and blood and anger. But that's not Zombie's work. He did create it yes, but he is saying that back in the 70's you would see this, but not LIKE this. It's society that's brought this on themselves-they like having the ability to make violence as realistic as possible- and now you have to deal with it. So Zombie's vision has been released from the chain, and like Frankenstein, he was never as bad as he was when he had no chain's holding him back. And movies were never as bad as they were when they had rules and regulations. Good one, Rob. At least I got it. I only wish the presentation was tweaked in a few areas, but that's why I'm able to be critical, I didn't make it. So well done, anyway. Zombie's vision is impaired, yes, but the actual exposition I fear will be making the box office sweat a little before it explodes with confused teenagers looking to get a glimpse of rural Texas as bad as it was in '78 with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Speaking of which, how about ""House of 1,000 Corpses""? It was a disgusting and emotionless pathological waste of time. But again, there's room for it at the Box Office because you know who's going to be rushing in, the teens. It attracts them because they figure if they can't sleep for weeks, it fits in with their usual schedule. I say this only because I honestly wasn't scared by that film, it was scary, yes, but not like Devil's Rejects. It holds you like no other movie. I guarantee it'll have parents upset and audiences raving. So I say it was good, yes. I say it was bad, yes. Do I recommend it...? Wink...",The Devil's Rejects
320,childrenwithknives,What's wrong with Ebert and Roeper?,2,20 October 2006,"Both Ebert and Roeper gave this movie a thumbs up? Now I really enjoyed 'House of 1000 corpses'. Sig Haig's antics even in the DVD's menu's is worth the price of the DVD alone. Truly hilarious!. Then the film it's self was down right terrifying at times, and creepy as hell. I expected the same with 'The Devil's Rejects'. what i got was frankly very disappointing. The whole thing takes place in the day and in the desert regions, so it comes off as more of a crazed killer action movie somewhat and not the least bit scary. There are some good effects here and there and one gory scene that is so well executed it looks as real as real can get. Some of the imagery of death are pretty convincing too. But I felt the film is simply uneven and tends to at moments look like amateurish film making, the kind that normally goes straight to the video rack. Now I have to admit I never liked 'White Zombie', but agree that they added a little something new to the mainstream of music in the mid 90's that seemed refreshing yet darkly unique.But having been deeply involved in the underground goth scene myself since 1993 bands doing the kind of music white zombie was doing were everywhere, so hearing their music in the goth context sounded like nothing new. It shows that all it takes a bunch of visual gimmicks to make you famous and people swallow it so easily. Visually Rob's 'White Zombie' looked very different from anything most people in the normal world had seen before. But to people like me most of the bands ideas were ripped off from other long established goth and industrial bands. So to me white zombie was a big yawn. So the same thing with Rob Zombie's solo work. His talent is obviously good and for mainstream America it seemed to be cutting edge. But there were already hundreds of bands out there for nearly a decade doing the same kind of music and usually it was better. Zombie was just lucky he used the visual gimmicks to get somewhere just as Marilyn Manson did. Both he and Manson are smart. They both know that all you need is a gimmick and people by the millions just swallow it like a nest of hungry birds. So I not just feel but know Rob Zombie is very smart, but is also pretty much over rated. I admire his courage to move into other technical talents. And it started to look like he could very well be a top notch director as'House of 1000 corpses' shows he has more talent as a director and writer than anyone could have ever expected. I didn't think that film was anything really special, but it was a pretty well made horror film and got the job done. But 'The Devil's Rejects' just didn't deliver what I was looking for. It was cool to hear some classic songs in the soundtrack, and often they fit in just right while other tracks simply didn't fit. The final sequence is well shot, but the whole affair left me saying. ""God is that it? I'm sorry but this movie sucked."" I'm no stranger to Horror and crazy Characters. I love Tarantino movies. But horror movies often suck now days. few really scare me at all. But this movie isn't a horror film at all. It's not awful, but 5 minutes after I watched it I forgot all about it and felt it had nothing worth remembering in it.",The Devil's Rejects
321,LeonardPine,Could have been so much better,6,6 August 2005,"First of all lets get this films major flaw out of the way. There's no-one in this film to root for! Is the audience supposed to side with the cruel sadistic psycho family? And if so, why? They humiliate and torture an innocent family of Banjo players, and then when the sheriff does the same to them, we're supposed give them sympathy! Yeah right.The film starts brilliantly with the opening shootout between the psycho gang and the cops, unfortunately it can't keep up the momentum for the duration. Director Zombie hasn't a clue about pacing and as a result the film kind of limps to its conclusion. What should have been a heart-racing final 20 minutes (chainsaw anyone?) is swapped for a rushed and silly climax. Also the film stops to many times for Tarantino-lite dialogue. Conversations about Chicken f*****g, Princess Leia fantasies, and Groucho Marks are all very well, but not when they grind the film to a halt.Zombie certainly likes to riff on his favourite horror movies.There's plenty of similarity with TCM, Last House on the Left, and The Hills Have Eyes. The film IS very violent and some of the more sadistic scenes will have some viewers heading for the exit. One scene in particular has the character of Baby forcing two women to hit each other for her amusement. Its a nasty and distasteful scene, one that this particular viewer found quite sickening.On a plus note the film looks great, with a washed out gritty look to the photography. Zombie really captures the 70's horror vibe, making it rather frustrating as its obvious the film could have been so much better.The acting in the film is superb considering the content, with William Forsythe stealing the film as the God-fearing sheriff on a rampage. Director Zombie can obviously handle actors well, and his film looks great, its just a shame the rest isn't up to scratch. It'll be interesting to see what he comes up with for his 3rd movie.",The Devil's Rejects
322,TheGonzoJoint,Now that's what I'm talking about. Violence with a purpose and humor accompanied by darkness. You've done it Rob. You. Have. Done it.,7,2 March 2011,"*** out of ****Ah, violence. Don't we all just love it? Well, we must considering how many violent films come out each year. After all; if we don't love violence, then nobody loves getting a big fat paycheck for making a film featuring any. It's hard to come across a filmmaker who uses violence in a particularly good way, since honestly, how good can violence get? Violence, in reality, is a terrible thing. In film, however, it can be put to good use. I find it quite shocking that the latest director to treat the depiction of violence with care happens to be Rob Zombie; the same man who made the incredibly indecent exploitation flick ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". When I heard he made a sequel, I wasn't thrilled. But when I heard it was actually quite good, THEN I was interested. You know how I said in my review for Zombie's first feature that the man has talent? Well, here's a film where he actually uses it. Zombie has improved as a filmmaker with ""The Devil's Rejects"", which is indeed a sequel to ""House of 1,000 Corpses"". What kind of surprises me about this sequel is how it doesn't even go for the same Grindhouse horror-feel that ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" seemed to be aiming for; it's less stylized and more focused on realism. And when violence is your subject, realism is going to come in and it's going to hit the audience so hard to the point where they may question their own mentality. If you think for one second that you're actually enjoying ""The Devil's Rejects"", then let me be the first to tell you that you are not crazy. I myself quite enjoyed Rob Zombie's second film, since this time he actually gets his technique right. I will not lie; ""Rejects"" is a brutal film which I found fairly disturbing. But with that being said, I still do believe it to be good cinema. I can understand such a film dividing audiences, but with people saying stuff like ""this is one of the sickest, brutal, most depraved films I have ever seen"", I kind of have to question just how many true film buffs are still living, since I know as much as we all know that Zombie's ""Rejects"" is not a sick, nasty film. Yes, it's violent. But not without a cause. I think that Zombie wanted to show how horrible violence truly is; thus he is by no means promoting it. Why would he? Why would I even like the film if I thought he was doing this? That's the point; I wouldn't. I think that it's very hard to look past the violent content of this film, but for those who can, it's a hell of a ride. ""The Devil's Rejects"" is actually pretty well-made; and it's as realistic as realistic gets. This is not a great film, although someday I think a lot of people will appreciate it for what it is. I will not tell you that you should see it; but if you can stomach the ride, then I say go for it. It's worth the time it requires.",The Devil's Rejects
323,hesdeadjim82,A great combination of blood and humour,10,7 January 2007,"I am an original fan of Rob's, 'House of a 1000 corpses' and I was very excited at the prospect of a sequel. I loved the quirkiness of his first movie and was expecting the same format with this one. However, I was pleasantly surprised when seeing this western/chase movie, which follows the firefly's and their blood lust while on the run.It is important for a movie to allow the viewer to care for the characters and want them to prosper over their counterparts. Devil's Rejects slowly convinces you and eventually you want the serial killing family to win and for them to kill all the good guys. How many movies can do that? There are some great one-liners in this movie. So, take a pen and paper and write them down! They are hilarious as well as disturbing, all at the same time.Definitely one for horror and slasher genre!",The Devil's Rejects
324,zsanctuary,Only pleasing in the most unpleasant of ways.,7,29 January 2006,"The Devil's Rejects is Rob Zombie's follow up to House of 1000 Corpses. The film is dark, morbid and almost as clunky as its predecessor; I liked it more that's for sure yet I still can't help but to feel it was a mixed bag of greatness (as far as horror films go) and mediocrity. At times I would roll my eyes while at others I'd be staring at the screen in disbelief (a good thing).Unlike most people I came into this movie expecting more violence than plot. This will cause the general viewer to call the film pointless and sick. Well it is sick but I wouldn't say it's pointless. What we have here is an extremely intriguing struggle between good and evil. The sheriff wants revenge for his brother's death and the Devil's Rejects are actually convinced that they're from Hell doing Satan's dirty work. The interesting part is how the sheriff goes about getting his revenge. It's basically a role reversal yet you're rooting for the sheriff merely because he is the hero. I was quite impressed by this since it's really hard to get me to root for somebody while they're torturing the villains and chasing them around with an axe.I think this works because of how the Devil's Rejects are developed. Rob Zombie spends a lot of time showing just how evil they are and by the end of the movie you really do want them to die. This sort of validates the sheriff's actions and really makes the whole thing more believable.In fact everything in this film looks real and probably could happen (well except for the one member of the family that looked like Freddy Krueger; that was a bit goofy). Sure the gore was unrealistically over the top but it's not really what makes the film so sick and real; It's how the villains treat their victims, the suffering and torture. I even felt that this was pushed too far and that's coming from a guy who smiles all the way through Day of the Dead's finale. Well I mean ""too far"" in the sense that even I had trouble watching. The thing is criminals go that far and often even further. This is more realistic than common slashers like Scream and Friday the 13th , no Hollywood heroes or impossible stunts. Nope the Devil's Rejects is unrelenting, unafraid and horrifyingly realistic.Ah but not all is well with this film. As I mentioned it's clunky much in the same way House of 1000 Corpses was. The plot often takes pointless turns or distracts the viewer with bizarre camera tricks. I also found a severe lack of character development. We know everybody's motivations but they are far too simple and there are a few too many stereotypical redneck personalities running around.The acting is passable but not really fabulous in any way. I really liked Ken Foree's performance but that's probably because I was so excited to see him in the film. The people playing the victims also did very good jobs with their simple characters but only because they weren't annoying. That may sound weird but one must remember that at its heart (however black it may be) this is a slasher flick. A sub-genre where women are constantly screaming and often these screams are at headache inducing pitches capable of breaking all the windows in your house. I much prefer the soft whimpering in Rejects.The Devil's Rejects also falters a lot in the originality department. Sure each of the villains is interesting and there are a few clever scenes here and there (the final highway scene is especially cool) but everything else has been done before.As you can see I really don't know what to make of The Devil's Rejects. I know I'd never watch this film again yet I know it's a good movie. It entertained me (sort of) for its running time and now I've seen what it's all about. I know it has problems but it also has many strengths. So I guess I'll recommend it to those who like this sort of thing. It's definitely not going to please everybody but those with a strong stomach and a sick mind should find it at least mildly entertaining.My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=rejects",The Devil's Rejects
325,bigfanofthebob42,"Nasty, nasty, nasty (now in SLOW MOTION)",8,11 February 2006,"Rob Zombie is now a filmmaker. Congratulations, Rob. You and your name have earned it. I still don't think your wife is an actress, or that you know the difference between great and awful dialogue, (because there's plenty of both in this one) but your new movie rocks. By ""rocks"", I mean ""festers in its own filth for 100 minutes"".This is one of the vilest, nastiest, most demented movies I've ever seen. It's not necessarily very gory, but the whole attitude exuded by the movie is completely morally reprehensible. It glorifies the exploits of foulmouthed serial killers, ranging from necrophiliacs to murderous, repugnant fat guys in clown makeup. And it does it very well, with the kind of passion most nice, happy movies that normal godfearers see like Passion of the Jesus Being Beaten and Whipped don't even bother to muster. The dialogue in this movie is so hellbent on being offensive that it actually half-offended even me. There is not a single truly sympathetic character in the movie that isn't treated like dirt and then killed in the most brutal way possible, and I wouldn't be as happy with it as I am if it was any other way.It's a nasty movie about nasty people doing nasty things to other nasty people. (that country band had it coming, I tell you)Some stretches of the movie, particularly in the second half, are gratuitous and lead nowhere, and there isn't much sense of a journey the main characters take, even though it's basically a road movie. And the great finale deserves to cap off a much stronger story.But this is a grindhouse horror flick, and compared to some of the stuff in the accepted classics of that genre, this is perfection.I'm interested in seeing what the man does next, and I hope he makes another movie with Captain Spaulding in it, because he's the most awesome nasty clown in the history of nasty clowns and should be in every movie Rob Zombie makes for the rest of his career. Hell, now I want to make movies and put Captain Spaulding in them just to make them better. He made House of 1000 Corpses watchable.Sheri Moon Zombie's ass should be engraved and displayed at the Smithsonian. If only I could say the same thing for her performance, which I find to be occasionally okay but mostly rather irritating and anachronistic. (she doesn't fit in the 70's at all)But in spite of some of my quibbles, Devil's Rejects is one of the all time great cinematic step-ups. It's a lot of Last House on the Left and a little of Bonnie and Clyde, yet stands independently of either of those because neither of them have nasty clowns traumatizing little boys.Side note: If this movie had no slow motion the running time would probably be 20 minutes shorter. Rob Zombie has made a cinematic first: a John Woo horror movie.",The Devil's Rejects
326,nobull408,Not too bad....,5,22 May 2006,"Upon the completion of the Devil's Rejects, I immediately thought of Wes Craven's, 'Last House on the Left'. The similarities between the two films, are differently there. Both have a pack of killers, abducting some hapless victims & torture, rape & then murder them. Only The Devil's Rejects was a lot more enjoyable. The movie features some very good acting from the cast, especially by the main characters.The dialog wasn't anything special. At times, I questioned what Rob Zombie was thinking about, such as a lot of Baby Firefly's dialog. The movie had a few good jokes in it as well, that were pretty witty. The violence is top notch & yes it has tons of nudity. Because for one reason or another... it works for this movie.",The Devil's Rejects

It just encourages the miscreants to produce more of this ilk. We went solely out of curiosity and I, for one was nauseous through some of the scenes of brutal torture. It's too bad that one can't get a refund based on the quality of the film itself. I'll have to be sure to read all the previews before going to any films in the first place.

328,Anubis013,Everything the a Horror film is supposed to be (might contain what could be construed as spoilers),10,4 August 2005,"A horror film. A brief look over the boards reveals that there are those that think this does not qualify as a horror film. I disagree, this is what hardcore horror started off as, just look at the originals ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""The Hills Have Eyes""...etc. etc. This is a throwback to those days. These types of films are first and foremost sadistic splatterfilms, not the slick higher budget mainstream, someone jumps from behind a door slasher films (no, I'm not bagging on them either). Some prefer slasher, some splatter, and some creature features and others combos. IF YOU DO NOT LIKE EXPANDED SCENES OF CASUAL DEPRAVITY DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.Now, that that is out of the way. Zombie has grown up. I loved the twisted ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" but I do recognize it could have been better. Instead of hitting a sophomore slump Zombie has excelled and created a horror masterpiece. It does what horror films are supposed to do, twist and mangle reality until it is a grotesque mirror image of reality.Zombie excels as deftly manipulating us, we root for the Firefly's, then these other guys, then the Firefly's again, and what's this?, yep the other guys again. Zombie parodies everything in this film that he can. From the ""happy"" ending, to the magnificent shootouts, brutal killings, religious irreverence, Hollywood, and even pulls the Marx brothers into his bizarre world of killer clowns and sexy knife wielding vixens.Our characters have grown up and become subtly complex. It sneaks up on you and before you know it Zombie is twisting American family values in your face...because if nothing the Firefly's are a devoted family.Brilliant film, and surprisingly not one single track from Rob himself, no new Zombie single to lull me off into my twisted, body wracking, night sweat, nightmare filled slumber. BUT, while he may be absent his choice of music tracks to highlight the film and again invoke irony is inspired. When a half-naked victim starts humming along with a blues tune playing on the TV you can almost feel the inspiration leap from the screen. I loved this film, my wife would hate it. Definitely a film to show in film class showcasing what horror films are capable of.To you Zombie, a standing ovation. Take a bow!",The Devil's Rejects

Completely predictable scenes that never manage to mesh together into a plot. This movie, quite simply, was terrible. A never ending excuse to show nudity, and gore for the sake of gore, it's quite obvious what caliber of person actually voted this one high. It's truly shocking that this movie has been voted higher than a 3, but it goes to show just how far our society as a whole has degraded.I'll never waste another minute on anything else made by Rob Cummings.*** Spoilers Below ***Basic plot is a family of 5 are serial killers. The dad's apparently a clown. Literally. No explanation, no development of character. They just have managed to kill an entire warehouse full of people without anyone being the wiser. Mom gets nabbed by the cops during a shootout, and one of the brothers gets killed. Others escape due to the cliché'd ineptitude of the cops.From there, innocent people are killed, sliced up, dismembered as the family goes on the run, with no real explanation of what their final goal or destination is. The majority of the women in the movie (alive or dead) are shown fully naked at some point. Perhaps between the gore and the nudity, it's the 14 year olds giving the movie such a high rank. At any rate, the family is just off running around, getting off on killing, torturing, and molesting the innocent. For kicks, Rob Cummings gives his wife tons of pointless, useless dialog (which consists of about 25% of the words being F***) and takes absolutely *EVERY* opportunity to show her butt, even creating some opportunities when there weren't any.Finally, a completely undeveloped ""bad-guy"" cop character quits his job to go after them ""his own way,"" ending in an unbelievably predictable and cliché'd gunfight. Again, I really can't fathom how this movie has the rating it does. It's just... BAD.Honestly, if you have ANY desire to see this trash, wait for it to come out on DVD, or better yet, borrow it from a friend and save your money. You'll already be disappointed at wasting your time.",The Devil's Rejects

That's true and our choices reveal much about us. When writing Texas Chainsaw, the real serial killer Ed Gein was drawn on. In truth, the only likable characters are the victims.

Watching paint dry would be a more productive use of your time.",1,26 July 2011,"This movie is one of the worse pieces of crap ever made. Everything that was said about Natural Born Killers, should be applied to this 'film', for lack of a better term. The only thing this movie illustrates, is that any idiot with a gun can think they are tough, and that they can then impose their will on others, what a wonderful message! If anything this 'film' shows why tougher gun control is a great idea, and what is shown on TV needs to be reexamined. To say this 'film' has senseless violence, would be an understatement, and that most of the gore is just the glorification of violence, again what a message! If I actually paid money to watch this filth, I'd be seriously annoyed, but wasting time to watch it is annoying enough, the only reason I waste more time writing about it is to save others from watching this pathetic 'film'. The ending only confirmed that zombie is trying to make the serial killers the 'heros' of the movie, with the stupid montage during the final shootout, which is just insane, how can anyone, who is of sane mind, identify with these 'heros'? The best part of the movie is the end credits. This 'film' looks like something some disturbed teenage boys threw together for laughs, not something from an adult, or at least someone who can be charged as one! If zombie is financing his own movies, that is bad enough, but if he is actually getting money from studios for filth like this movie, then the studios need to be shut down.

334,Zombafyed,What the genre needed..but....,9,23 July 2005,"I saw House, and loved it because of the sick humor mixed with crazy demonic imagery. It was what I would expect from Rob Zombie. It has it's corny moments, it's scary moments, it's brutal moments, it's sexy (slutty, actually) moments..etc. Just like the cheap B movies that we know Rob is so fond of.But Devil's Rejects wasn't like it's predecessor. It is a scary, unnerving, nauseating, sadistic, mind **** from beginning to end. Now, I knew it would be more 'realistic', I guess, because of the environment. The actual house in ""House"" was creepy, with Baby's room with the dolls, and Tiny's room, with the people locked up in the cages of dirty laundry. Especially in Dr. Satan's lair, lined with skulls, zombie-like experiments and dead bodies. Devil's rejects lacks that extra color, but makes up for it with extremely bothersome imagery. There is no restraint, or mercy in this movie. There is nothing cartoonish about it either.There is another review on this site that says the same things I am saying, but since I agree, I will reiterate.I've been complaining that all the recent horror movies have stunk, and are just cheap thrill fests. I went to Devil's Rejects and expected to see campy Zombie evil/fun, but instead got that scary movie I've been looking for. The characters were very well developed, however I do think good IL' Wydell was a bit over the top, especially during the little get together with the film expert, and a fight almost ensues for Elvis not being appreciated. Other than that, the character acting was great. And don't get me wrong, it has it's humor and funny moments, however sadistic they may be. They were all pretty funny.To sum up, the movie was superb. A good step for Zombie, while switching it up, and possibly losing a couple fans, he has struck a nerve in a genre that needed it, so hopefully this movie goes over well in the Box Office, and Zombie gets some funding for some more gorefests.Too bad Grandpa couldn't be in this one :-( he was pretty funny.",The Devil's Rejects

I find it insulting that anyone would even deem this worthy of a horror film. This is what happens when you don't write a second draft, and then you let your movie influences get in the way. I wasted valuable time watching 'House of 1,000 Corpses' and now I've done it again by thinking this film would be any better. Rob Zombie might find himself to be a better video music video director than a horror film director. 'The Devils Rejects' is so awful that I would definitely go out of my way to convince others to simply stay away and watch 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' instead.

Movies are meant to evoke feeling, and this movie sure as heck does that! Anyway, after reading a bunch of the user reviews I'm seeing that most people praise the actors who played the bad guys. Don't forget William Forsythe as Sheriff John Wydell!!!! William Forsythe's character was AMAZING! He radiated an almost psychotic intensity I don't think I have ever seen on film before. He was a good guy (sort of) and yet he was one of the scariest characters in the film! He was gonna do God's justice, and man, did he ROCK! His torture scenes back in the Firefly house were totally sick, but I couldn't help just cheering him on! Yeah torture, maim, kill 'em! Wooo!

More than a bit full on and seemingly enjoying itself too much for its own good. That aside its well shot, full of interesting colourful characters, is quite fumy (in a dark way) in places and basically no one is a good guy at least by its ending save perhaps one person (he's a scumbag really) who learns that no good deed goes unpunished with an axe in his back!

I'm not offended at the language or the concept that the main characters are soulless weirdos. What I'm offended at is that it was made period. Mr. Zombie pays homage to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left and probably twenty other horror movies that were all, sad to say, far superior to this thing. It absolutely blows my mind that this film is rated higher than Gigli. I've never even seen Gigli, but if it wasn't this, I like it. I've never seen a movie that I honestly thought was deserving of a 1 out of ten until today. I probably would give it a 2 because Sid Haig is interesting to look at and I like Geoffrey Lewis and William Forsythe, but like I said, I paid money so a 1 it is.In closing, Mr. Zombie, your music isn't bad.

This movie FAR exceeded any expectation I had. Zombie NAILED it in this one. Classic Freeze frames, awesome soundtrack(used with purpose)-Just enough gore with out going over the top.. the essential random nudity shots that we B fans have come to expect. Suspenseful through-out.I realize that what makes all of these components work:A- This movie (Unlike 99% of all B Horros) is not predictable. You do not know what is going to happen next. B- Zombie builds characters. You learn history and connections, and see things from their view. C- Slight comedic aspect added.

340,pjveerman,Hellbilly Deluxe,7,28 February 2013,"Robert Cummings, better known as Rob Zombie, isn't exactly a very good director. If you've seen ""House of 1000 corpses"" you've probably realized that this movie is extremely chaotically written and directed. There's no straight line or anything like that to be found in the movie. To be clear, this isn't exactly always a bad thing. But for some reason, in House of 1000 corpses it just didn't work for me. In it's sequel, ""The Devil's Rejects"", you'll find something which feels way more like a movie that's actually finished. Rob Zombie has a twisted mind. I'm a fan of the guy's music so that made me wondering what kind of movies he would make. Well, kind of exactly what I expected. Pretty sick and twisted. Good. I love the cast in the first place, including his beautiful wife Cherri-moon Zombie, who practically plays in all his movies. You'll follow a psychotic, sick minded family on a road rampage, actually it's nothing more than that. Which is fine in this case. It's everything this movie needs. It starts off with some cops and a sheriff surrounding the house where the family is in which ends up in a massive shoot-out. From there on it's nothing more than a bloody and sick road trip. Don't expect a deep story line or outstanding dialogues. You will not enjoy this movie if you do that. If you expect a pretty mindless, blood packed roller-coaster ride with even some family drama, you'll probably love it. There even is a chance that, like me, you'll actually somehow gonna feel sorry for one of the most psychotic families in movie history. Hell yeah, Rob Zombie!",The Devil's Rejects
341,kirkbroadhurst,A step backwards from Zombie,4,19 November 2005,"Loved House of 100 Corpses? If you read these comments, you'd be led to believe that this is the same except better. More accurately, though, it's barely reminiscent and far worse.The excitement and randomness of the first film is gone. The random, unpredictable acts are gone. The totally bizarre story (Dr Satan) is gone.*** Spoilers ***While House 1000 Corpses was from the point of view of the innocent victims to be slain, this movie is shot from the perspective of Otis, Baby and Spalding who are trying to escape the police and a vengeful sheriff. Okay, fair premise. However the writer seems intent on continually persuading us that the trio are evil psychopaths. Captain Spalding's dream and living situation evoke a few laughs before Otis and Baby, whilst waiting for Spalding, decide to harass a group of people. We don't know much about these people, and so don't really care one way or the other about them, but we are submitted to watching these two hold guns to their heads telling them to 'shut the f*ck up bitch' and so forth. Okay, got it - they are psychopaths. 'Do what I say, bitch', etc. Yawn. This continues for 20-30 minutes.Eventually Spalding catches up - not sure why this takes so long - and then after visiting Spalding's brother and having an encounter with the cop whose brother was killed in House 1000 Corpses, they drive into a police roadblock with guns blazing. The movie was sitting on a 3/10 until this final scene, which is just too hilarious for words. Watch them leaning out of the car shooting and the cops, then cut to a scene of the three of them arm-in-arm wandering through a field smiling and laughing. Huh? Playing 'trippy' music and cutting back between the two juxtaposed scenes for at least five minutes... what an ending! HA!House of 1000 Corpses was a funny movie. The ending of this is funny in it's complete stupidity, but the rest is just a drag. Next time the writer might wish to try:cutting about 30 minutes from the film's running time. - refraining from continually reminding us that the characters are 'psychopaths'. Killing people is, in itself, not interesting. Please kill people in interesting circumstances. - using some of the characters unique traits to better effect - e.g. Spaulding doing some more clown related antics, Otis having outbursts, and Baby being sexy and stupid. - more shocks!Please, people. This movie is not at all shocking. There are more shocks in movies from the 70s, let alone the 80s or 90s. I expected *more* than House, not far less.",The Devil's Rejects

Anyone who has any idea of a linear story line, or knows what a real character is will hate HATE this movie.Man, what a lame duck. I don't even know where to begin. When it is convenient for the story, the main bad guys shrug off every hit, every beating, every gunshot, without even breaking a sweat, but the people that they are torturing crumble at every turn. In several scenes, using the same weapons used on bad guys, but when the script calls for it, the people just willingly give up and politely die.ARghhhh I can't believe people are giving this good ratings.

343,filmguy_07,... Rob Zombie actually wrote about ****ing chickens...,3,31 May 2006,"When I watched House of 1,000 Corpses for the first time, I realized that I had come across not just the worst horror film ever done, but the worst FILM ever done, period. And I've seen Cabin Fever AND Jason X for God's sakes! Highly abrasive and downright impossible to watch characters such as the Firefly Family should not have even been conceived in the neural synapses of a human being's brain, much less appear on a blank sheet of a screenplay, MUCH less visually manifest onto a big screen. I thanked God almighty that a friend let me borrow the movie so I didn't waste any money, but I cursed the fact that I lost over an hour of my life, never to return. I could have been watching f'in adult swim for crying out loud.Then a friend of mine saw The Devil's Rejects in the theatre and LOVED it, and he hated Corpses as much as I did. I decided I'd check it out on DVD (once he bought it, of course) to see what the deal was. Perhaps Rob and friends got it right, and I excited to see how this movie could change my friend's opinion. What I witnessed was... well, crap, but not quite the crap it once was.Rejects is yet another plot-deficient jump around that has about as much direction as a white man dancing in a Spike Lee movie. After the cops come upon the Firefly home and start to rain bullets upon them (to which I was having a joygasm to), Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding (the only enjoyable role in either film) take off on a random misadventure of more random murder with no purpose other than the fact that they are redneck douchebags. And the fact that Zombie expects us to empathize with these people? Please. The closest I've ever come to identifying myself with a redneck is Joe Dirt, and David Spade is about as far from a redneck as you could get.As Corpses before it, Zombie apparently has some grudge against people who have nothing to do with anything, and tediously tortures and kills these faceless crash-test dummies. SOMEBODY tell Zombie that what makes a killer ENJOYABLE to watch in a film is their PURPOSE! NO PURPOSE = BORING KILLER! Hell, have Otis kill people because of the fact his ugly beard has caused him to go insane. ANYTHING! And PLEASE quit writing your hot wife into this irritating role! It's painful to watch someone that attractive be so annoying.Visually, Zombie has definitely upped his game. The 70's style shooting brings back fond memories of better films of the past, which was enjoyable. And the lack of cut shots of women masturbating with skeletons was also a major plus. Zombie's choice to take this movie out of the House and onto the dirty back roads was also an excellent choice, giving it a bit of roguish charm. And, as most, I was thoroughly impressed with Zombie's use of ""Freebird"" for the final sequence. Now if someone could find the plot and characters with some way to relate to the audience, we'd be in some business.While it is certainly leaps and bounds from Corpses, Rejects is still not a very good film. Irritating characters, tedious torture, pointless deaths, and a haphazard plot that actually includes a conversation about ****ing chickens leaves the second attempt by Rob to still be sub-par. I really wish Rob would have just started with this movie instead. Rejects makes him look like a novice, which is okay to be, instead of a horror film idiot like Corpses made him look.",The Devil's Rejects
344,dimlim77,The Devil's Rejects...this is how it is done,9,24 March 2006,"I just watched this movie after having avoided it because I thought it was going to be another overly gory horror-slasher film. Boy, I could not be more wrong. This is simply a great movie disguised in a genre that (lets admit it) usually sucks.Obviously there were needless deaths and blood scenes galore but there were not excessive and they were not gore-filled, mind-numbing snooze-fests. And Rob Zombie did a great thing by not living up to the needs of American movie goers (you know, having everything turning up roses at the end so people can feel at ease). No, this movie makes you feel a little sad because of what happens to the good guy in all of this. Sheriff Wydell snaps and goes onto a great rampage before he is killed by one of the evil family and in the end it is the rest of the police force that finishes the job.If you want me to put my conclusion in fancy words, well here they are. The cinematography is superb, the editing is perfectly precise and the acting is not over the top. This is truly an enjoyable sequel to House of 1000 corpses and it should be noted as one of the best films to come out in the horror or thriller or slasher or suspense genre.",The Devil's Rejects
345,instigate_insanity,Modern day horror spliced with a twisted sense of humour,8,25 May 2006,"For those of you who listen to the music of the legend that is Rob Zombie, and have seen both of his forays into the world of cinema, then you'll agree with me that what you witness in both of his movies kinda seem to represent the extremes of what you get in his music.In House of 1000 Corpses, for example, you get the more carnival oriented side of his music, the neon-lit Hollywood land of songs like ""Spookshow Baby"" and ""Grease Paint and Monkey Brains"". And now with The Devil's Rejects, we get the meat and gristle side of his music, the mysticism, the sex, the blood, and the gore of songs like ""Dragula"", ""Superbeast"" and ""Blood, Milk and Sky"".I was slightly disappointed with House of 1000 Corpses. It was like a new age remake of one of those weird old horror flicks you can catch now and again on Briz 31- lots of neon lighting, trippy music, incredibly cheesy horror, with possibly the most bizarre character names in any movie I have watched to date.Well, fans of new-age horror, rejoice. For what we have here is a far cry from House of 1000 corpses. No neon lights; no cheap and tacky costumes; no cheesy music. What we have here is a visual orgy filled with brilliantly executed gunfights, sadistic torture and abuse scenes, screwed-up sexuality, brilliant music and a visual grittiness that fans of the El Mariachi trilogy will absolutely love.Much like House of 1000 corpses, the movie swims with a dark and twisted form of humour (once again, much like Zombie's music) which has the (often unnerving) ability to make the viewer laugh out loud whilst one of Otis Firefly's many victims' intestines are splattered half a kilometre down the road. This movie displays ten times the amount of gore that ""House"" did, with people being nailed to chairs, splattered into a sticky pulp by passing vehicles, and being tied up and forced to wear the skins of the Firefly family's many victims as gruesome masks. It is all portrayed utterly realistically, and not for one moment does the thought ""Jesus, I wonder how many tubs of strawberry jam they went through to make this movie?"" swim across your mind.The individual members of the Firefly family are portrayed brilliantly and sadistically by Bill Moseley, Sherri Moon, and Karen Black, but as it was in ""House"", so it is here as it is once again Bill Moseley who steals the show, perfectly playing a character whose life is completely ruled over by violence, sadism, cruelty, torture and (shudder) necrophilia. A character we unfortunately don't see enough of is Tiny, the hulking, scarred, mentally retarded Firefly (played by Matthew McGrory) who provided moments of bemused entertainment in ""House"".If it's modern day horror with a twist of dark humour you're after, look no further than ""The Devil's Rejects"". It disappoints slightly in its duration time, but promises a fun ride with the rest. Rob Zombie easily earns an 8 from me.",The Devil's Rejects

347,Cannibully,How a sequel should be done.,9,23 July 2005,"This is how a sequel should be done. This is a stand-alone movie. House of 1000 Corpses is good for back story, but not at all necessary to enjoy this movie. The Devil's Rejects is different in every way from its predecessor. Gone are the cheese and camp that made House so much fun. This movie is pure horror. And in my opinion, it's much better than the first. Rob Zombie is pure genius. At some point during the course of the film I found myself sympathizing with the ""bad guys."" You start out horrified and disgusted with these people. But by the end they are your heroes. It happens so gradually you don't even realize it. My only complaint is this... **MINOR SPOILER ALERT** Where is Dr. Satan? Again, you don't need to see the first movie to thoroughly enjoy this one. Keeping that in mind, the absence of Dr. Satan is completely forgivable. But if you like to tie up all loose ends, this will bug you. I'm hoping to see a prequel that tells Dr. Satan's story and how he got hooked up with the Firefly family. **END SPOILERS** Karen Black does not reprise her role as Mother Firefly in this one. Leslie Easterbrook (Yes, Lt Callahan from Police Academy) takes over the role. The weird thing is, not only do you accept it, it seems like the only way to make it work. Karen Black played the part of Mother Firefly in a humorous way, very fitting of the first film. Leslie Easterbrook has a much darker and scarier take on the character, far more appropriate for The Devil's Rejects. In case you haven't figured it out, I LOVED this movie.

348,MikeisBored,The film that saved horror in 2005,9,27 July 2005,"Of all the tragically lame Hollywood rehashes of 70's exploitation horror (Texas Chainsaw, Wrong Turn), Rob Zombie's ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" proved to be the only film to be made with love and care. Zombie's shown his knowledge of horror and camp dating back all the way to ""The Cabinet of Dr. Calagari"" in his music videos for years. Zombie's ""love letter"" to drive- in horror was done to the T, even the clichéd ""The End?"" tacked on. For its inevitable sequel, ""The Devil's Rejects"", Zombie didn't just redo the same film (as the Texas Chainsaw series did), he pushed the genre forward. The tables have turned this time right from the start. The law has finally had enough of the Firefly gang and forces them out of their house. Those who survive the hectic shootout spend the rest of the film on the run. (But don't worry, they make sure to spend time torturing a few unlucky blokes while they lay low for an act.) Meanwhile, the vengeful county sheriff, still seeing red over his brother's murder in the previous film, is hell bent on exacting revenge. Does the Firefly family fear anything? More importantly do they love anything?The plot is very basic, but the film makes great use of its time exploring its characters. You may or may not find yourself feeling sympathy for the Firefly family, but no doubt their bond is something thats been overlooked in every ""crazy murdering family"" movie. It's amazing to just watch how comfortable and ""normal"" these characters are around each other, trusting each other, being honest to each other. They are a true family. Not to mention Sheriff Wydell's decent into madness, drawing a brilliant parallel between him and his adversaries.But all that narrative and film-making shnozzy stuff, blah blah. Is it offensive!? Damn right it is! Hell, the film does open with a naked corpse being dragged through a lawn after all. There's graphic full frontal nudity, unedited head shots, entry wounds, exit wounds... you name it. The family is without their 1,000 corpse house, so don't expect the deaths to be as complicated, but the verbal abuse and diversity of the victims is all there. Also, what makes this movie great is that every character (except two or three) all deserve their death due to their incompetence or failure to keep a cool head. Acting - as usual, Sid Haig steals the show. He gets to unleash his Spaulding charm on twice as many lucky people in this one and it's a blast to watch. And the cameos! oh the brilliant old school horror cameos. Ken Foree and Michael Berryman play hilarious characters with lots of screen time. Not to forget professional actor / comedian / horror film geek, Brian Posehn.9/10 stars just because i saw the climax coming a mile away. But everything before and after (and a little during) is brilliant. The soundtrack, the duologue, so many hilarious fake- outs in the narrative using edits and camera reveals.

349,carlink,Probably a top ten slasher/horror,10,19 October 2021,"Everything Rob Zombie has made after this movie has been awful (including 3 from hell)
1000 corpses and TDR are interesting and intelligent horror movies that do a great job of making you actually care about the bad guys.I think The Devils Rejects is up there with my favourite movies and has a killer soundtrack which fits perfectly from the first to the last killing.If you haven't seen this yet put it on your watch list, it's a masterpiece.",The Devil's Rejects
350,StuffedMannequin,"One of the best, brutal, gritty, and absolutely bad-ass",10,24 July 2005,"Okay, first off, I loved House of 1000 Corpses, when i first herd of it i didn't think much of it, but I had a few friends come in saying it was the best ever so when it came out of DVD, they brought it over and we all watched it. I loved it immediately. It wasn't because I was expecting it to be scary, which it wasn't, it reminded me a lot like a fun house, I enjoyed it very much. When I herd the devils rejects was coming out, I nearly peed myself, I saw production photos, it really reminded me of an action western with horror elements which really got me excited. I loved the shootout in House of 1000 Corpses between Otis, the cop and Don Willis. For about a year i anticipated this, it was honestly going to be the best, and by the time it came out, I was ready to explode. I caught the movie the 23rd of July, just a day after the day it came out at the 7 o clock show, I took my seat with my friends, also house of 1000 corpses freaks, and awaited eagerly for the picture to come on, when it did, the image shot at our faces like a bullet.SPOILER The beginning shootout was absolutely amazing against the police and the firefly family, when they escape the beginning credits come on, the way the credits were shot really reminded me of old school movies, 70s campy music playing, title flashes, kind of reminded me of a 60s and 70s sitcom. Speaking of which I'm extremely glad Rob Zombie made the movie the way he did, if anyone else was directing, it would surly be forgotten. There were many scenes, it seemed, if directed by another, the audience would surly laugh at it, but rob took the job very seriously, that means shaky camera, take no jokes acting, closeups and make it as brutal as possible. I was very glad. Also, Rob didn't want the whole thing to be serious, so in between its seriousness, he added a bit of comedy in it, you'll see comedy elements throughout, i wont tell you, so you'll have to see for yourself, but let me tell you, they're classic.The scenes in the motel room rocked. It lasted a good long while but it kept the ball rolling, as if you were there, experiencing it in real life, another thing that made me very happy, and a big surprise afterwords ^_^.The end will leave none disappointed, at least me, in a way it reminded me of ""Bonnie and Clyde"", made me glad it didn't end with a thud but with a huge BANG! All and all, the devils rejects is one of the best I've seen out there, brutal, gritty and absolutely bad-ass. Captain Spaulding is still the same old lovable clown we all know and love, baby has forgotten her annoying laugh in favor of a very serious tone, and Otis is still the bad-ass we loved since 2003 when Rob introduced us to House of 1000 corpses. Fans of the first will adore this one if they look at it differently than the first. It is definitely one of the best sequels ever.10/10",The Devil's Rejects
351,markmywords85,Surprised? Certainly. Astounded? Absolutely,10,23 July 2005,"The Devil's Rejects hit me like a sucker punch. Being a fan of 70s horror in general, I was a big fan of House of 1000 Corpses when it came out. For all the major bashing it took for its campiness, borrowing from other sources, and pseudo-art house aspirations, I found it to be enjoyable, simple horror that didn't take the genre TOO seriously, without being mean spirited. When I sat down in the theater for The Devil's Rejects, I wasn't really prepared for the genius bit of cinema Rob Zombie created. While the touches of camp humor and over the top violence linger, the film itself was beautiful, multi-layered, and unique.While Corpses set up the deranged Firefly family as a stock group of serial killers, straight out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, TDR refined the characters, making for a movie that was much more realistic. Sheri Moon drops the annoying cackle this time around, in favor of sly deviousness and frantic bloodlust as Baby. Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding becomes the villain everyone suspected he was in Corpses, while providing most of the movie's comic relief. But it is Bill Mosely who is the true standout as Otis Driftwood. While the Otis of the previous installment is terrifying at times, many of his mannerisms and lines are derivative of Charles Manson, pushing the boundaries from crazy to just plain funny (the lines about ""scooping ice cream for s**theel friends"" still makes me crack up). This humor is mostly gone from Otis. He is dark, deranged, and murderous, but the love and protection he offers to his ""family"" truly challenged me as a viewer, and awed me to Mosely's subtle and amazing performance. Granted, he still has a few great, hilarious lines, specifically one referencing that OTHER madman in theaters right now, Willy Wonka.Aside from the Firefly clan, the supporting cast is terrific. William Forsythe is powerful and chilling as the sheriff driven by his brother's murder to enact revenge just as grisly as the Fireflys' crimes. The gang from ""Banjo & Sullivan"" are utterly believable and help create some of the film's most haunting moments. Ken Foree is a delight to genre fans who will recognize him as the young cop in the original Dawn of the Dead, here portraying a struggling pimp with ties to Captain Spaulding. Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page provide some truly sleazy moments as the Unholy Two, bounty hunters who are just as amoral as their prey. A truly stellar ensemble cast indeed.Rob Zombie nearly upstages this cast, however, with a script and style as visceral as the grittiest of 70s slasher originals (Last House on the Left, the Hills Have Eyes, and Texas Chainsaw all come to mind). Make no mistake, the Firefly family is vicious, unrepentant, and probably deserve the worst punishments Sheriff Wydell has in mind. They are rapists, killers, and sadists; in short, they are the darkest heart of America, and humanity itself. Why then do we pull for them? Why yearn for their escape? This is what puzzled and confused me, challenged me to think, and in short why I left the Devil's Rejects speechless. While some complained that it was not really scary, I found it truly frightening; that Rob Zombie could give a glimpse into the darkest acts of human depravity and still find some kinship with the perpetrators of such evil scared me. Unlike the over the top killers of House... this Firefly clan has bonds as strong as any family, and scant remnants of redemption beneath layers of evil.Visually, the film is stunning. Stark without being clichéd, Zombie pulls no punches and delivers a haunting vision of the heart of America. While some have complained it is ""not a real horror film,"" Zombie's vision is more frightening than any pilfered Americanized Japanese horrors of the past few years. Cannot come more highly recommended from a fan of the genre. If you're prepared to take a chance and be repulsed and drawn in to a world of depravity, see the Devil's Rejects.",The Devil's Rejects

The movie Started with good Mystery scene but the the movie Scene's were Lost and Not clear enough. The effects were good and invested all along the Movie until the end. One Good more thing was the makeup.specially the Make-up of the clown and tiny who were Maked-up professionally.Like i Said the clown actor played well and Also Sheri moon played well in Sexy role i must say.Leslie Easterbrook who Was Her Mother (in the Movie of course) played very good and by the way She worked and played On the whole Police Academy series's.

353,thornswrath,A Love Letter To Horror Fans,9,31 July 2005,"My impression of The Devil's Rejects is that it's a love-letter, signed & sealed by Rob Zombie and delivered straight to all the old-school horror fans. Just as sheriff Wydell states in the movie, ""I've been walking the line my whole life, until I seen there is no line"", this story simply tells it like it is, and sticks to the facts of what essentially is a showdown between good & evil, only everything ain't OK at the corral, in Zombie's vision.Somewhere in the presentation of this dynamic lies the film's saving grace. Because what it manages to slyly pull off is invite the discriminating viewer to put forth a judgment on the proceedings. ""Slyly"" because that is the one thing the filmmaker never does (make a judgment). The Devil's Rejects is not what many (who haven't seen it, ironically) will have you believe it is -- an alleged ""celebration"" of violence or evil; but rather, it is merely an in-depth examination of the characteristics of both evil & good, and how the line that would be drawn between them is either incredibly elastic or may not even exist at all. (If there was ever a rape scene, it was thankfully cut) The movie is at once a horror film based on the structure of a classic western, and if viewed as a monster movie, it can be noted that the monster wears a mask of the human face. I found the movie to redeem itself from the accusations of those who refuse to see it, for the very reason that it has baited them into committing the mistake of judgmentalism -- the very act it refrains from indulging in, itself. The movie succeeds in the simple respect of telling a straightforward story. The fact many audience members find themselves actually rooting for the outlaws (yet not necessarily sympathizing with them) rather than the clan of cops who have sunk to their level in retaliation, becomes one of the most striking aspects of Rob Zombie's achievement.If you like horror films, monster movies, or westerns, this movie was made for you.

354,sjsully,Plain Garbage,1,3 January 2007,"I can't believe this film was actually allowed to be released!! My God, what kind of crack are the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) smoking anyway?? I consider myself to be very liberal when it comes to all forms of art and/or entertainment - even when it oversteps the bounds for ""art"" sake (some good examples would be 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Natural Born Killers'). This movie, however , was a senseless, pointless, gratuitous, morally degenerate piece of crap-waist of my time. And talk about BORING. Not one scary scene in the whole goddamn film! As I said, just disturbing, claustrophobic material. Movies like this, Hostel, and A Texas Chainsaw Massacre (these two I have not seen) are the movies that make it in mass media. C'Mon. They are all aimed at the 13-20 something market (perhaps the most impressionable age in our society), and that is disconcerting. Stop paying money to these hacks, people! They are mocking you. They have it in their head that this is what you want to see. It's all for the purpose of making money ($). Do your job MPAA! Understand that you have a duty to society. Movies like this should be banned for two reasons: they SUCK! And they are CRASS.People, if you want to see a real horror film and be scared, watch 'Halloween', 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Psycho' or 'The Shining'. All of these movies serve its purpose in art & entertainment, they are scary, original, but also have a moral compass; the directors and writers all have or had respect for its viewers.

356,FioMnsfld,Whoa.,10,6 January 2006,"This movie is great. Fantastic. At the opening where there is a shoot out between the killers and cops, you think, ""This is really clichéd, hope it doesn't stay like this."" Thankfully, it doesn't. In fact, I'd go as far as to say I've never seen anything like it.The film works on two different levels: If you go to see the brutality, gore and out-and-out sick torture scenes, go. Enjoy the ride. But if you go for something a little deeper that exposes a lot of emotions, it's all here. Particularly clever is the use of sexual threat, and you think that this scene is going to lead to a rape scene, but it never goes there, even though it gets pretty damn close.This has two different kinds of horror: Anticipation and brutality. I think honestly, that the intense anticipation in this film is some of the best ever made. There's one particular scene where Dr. Satan holds the claw of a hammer over a girls head, and the scene lasts for 30 seconds with no dialogue from the characters. It is absolute genius. The brutality I can't put to words. You have to see it yourself.I have two pieces of advice about this movie: 1. See House of 1000 Corpses first (the prequel), and 2. Is expect brutality.

All in all The Devils Rejects, I personally believe to be one of the greatest pieces of modern genre cinema (if not one of the best pieces of cinema period) the passion for its subject matter, characters and respect for the genre is completely evident (if the opening credits don't have the hairs on the back of yer neck standing up, like wise with the freebird and terry reid ending, then you just aren't human) all combining to form one of the greatest drive-in horrors never to make it to a drive-in.",The Devil's Rejects
359,oneblip,Entertainment for psychotics,4,20 January 2006,"The Plot: A bunch of psychotic mass murderers are on the run from a sheriff who seeks vengeance for the murder of his brother by said individuals.I liked the original movie, House Of 1000 Corpses, despite bad reviews and poor media attention. So, I figured the sequel would offer, at worst, more of the same. What I found instead was a complete waste of film. If you never did like the first film this probably comes as no surprise to you. A warning: there are minor spoilers ahead, but nothing too earth shattering.As horror movies go, there are usually several things that must be present. Hot chicks, pre-marital sex, violence, blood, good guys, and a viciously evil bad guy or bad guys. Well this movie certainly has hot chicks, violence, blood, and viciously evil bad guys. What has been left out? That's right, one of the most important parts, good guys.Usually the biggest thing that drives a horror movie is the suspense of someone trying to escape capture or get away. Devil's Rejects doesn't do much of this and when it does, does it very poorly. The people who might have been considered the good guys are finished off so quickly that you barely even care for them. You could consider the sheriff the good guy, as he tries to rain down vengeance by the hand of god himself.Even still he doesn't ""walk the line"", instead he comes off as just another dirty underhanded person almost like every character in the movie. Not displaying even one likable quality other than the fact he's hunting down the other horrible people. I would have like to see a little more tension build, but there wasn't any tension about it. You can be sure of one thing though, all the characters you might care for, Rob Zombie will kill.The movie is full of unnecessary comments about sex, and a semi-rape scene. We already get that the Devil's Rejects have killed a lot of people, okay? We know they are very bad people. Do we really need further clarification in the form of a woman who is forced to say she likes being rubbed in her special place by a gun barrel? This scene on its own created such an uncomfortable atmosphere that I wanted to turn the movie off right there.I think you know what I've been getting at. The movie stinks simply because it lacks entertainment value in the form of a single likable character. It's what I call the Lords Of Dog Town syndrome. You get the feeling there is supposed to be somebody here you'd like to see survive but you can't figure out who, because every character lacks any thing really likable.In my opinion this seems like Rob Zombie's version of a small time softcore porno movie. You get the feeling all he likes to see is his wife shaking her ass or somebody else getting naked or violated in some sexual way. All this ends up being is an hour and a half spent with people you'd never want to meet in real life.I've had a couple people comment that I miss the point of the movie. And that the point Zombie is trying to prove is that we can feel sorry for people who are terrible, when they are in a terrible situation because they are family. Well I'd have to say no, I didn't feel sorry for them at all. In fact, I found myself liking the scenes where they got the crap knocked out of them. They got what they deserved, why am I supposed to feel horrible for them? Because they got things done to them that they did to countless innocent people? WRONG.",The Devil's Rejects

I was surprised to find such a huge narrative flaw in this, given it would have been relatively easy to restructure. SPOILER: the early part works well and I like the character of the half-mad Sheriff... However, vengeance on the wicked by a police officer is not narratively satisfying. We cannot empathize with the wicked, however abused they may be. Nor can we empathize with the sheriff who has let his grief and madness make him as crazy as the people he has in his clutches. So we are left, oddly, in the middle of all the blood and madness, unconnected to the film. The essential ""gimmick"" of horror (that we become the chased...) is missing throughout most of the film. Perhaps the filmmaker thought this was an interesting variation on the ""usual"" connection to the victim that the viewer makes... but it obviously doesn't work (at least for me). He could have made the same film in a slightly different order and kept us engaged. Sad, for all the effort at being edgy to be defeated by the old fashioned narrative arc.",The Devil's Rejects

Great.On the other hand I felt a strong nagging sensation that Zombie had made a real effort to exploit me and everyone else in the audience: He had sought to 'achieve' most deliberately and on purpose what Natural Born Killers had done by accident, that is to glamorise and glorify the psychos and their actions in such a way as to incite furor in the moral guardian/pro censorship brigade.To me this was just a cynical and exploitative career move executed with all the subtlety of a sledge hammer to the back of the head.As stated I was split between enjoyment and annoyance at about a 50/50 ratio. However after reading some of the posts on the message boards for this flick I think the scales are tipping in favour of irritation. We actually have people here hailing Zombie as a Genius and this film as GREAT. It seems that prior to release Zombie asserted that his work was a comment on the nature of violence, an exploration of the themes therein. Clearly this has been lapped up.Personally I'm incredulous: the parallels in tone, style and even narrative with Natural Born Killers are pretty precise. A platform from which numerous blatant plays for notoriety and outrage are made, not least in the Thelma And Louise type ending, all of which are insultingly obvious.Now I know many fans of DR will at this point be thinking ""well he just couldn't deal with the raw handling of the subject matter"". The truth is though I've been a fan of extreme cinema for almost two decades, and own more brutal films than most people have had hot dinners!If you want films that explore the nature of violence and serial killer pathology watch Henry: Portrait Of A serial Killer, Funny Games, or A Short Film About Killing.If you want something in a similar vein to DR but with more heartfelt honesty to it go for The Manson Family by director Jim Van Bebber, a retina raping tour De force that manages to make one or two concise observations on the aforementioned subjects in between copious lashings of psychedelic sex and violence.",The Devil's Rejects

368,DeadSkinMask,"Much Better Than ""Corpses""",7,4 August 2005,"I saw this flick with my girlfriend opening day. As soon as the opening credits started to roll, I knew that this movie was going to rock. And it did, to a certain extent.The Devil's Rejects is less of a music video than it's predecessor. There aren't as many stupid video tricks and things. In fact, stylistically, it is so different from Corpses. It's dusty and vaguely grainy, whereas Corpses was lush and neon and lurid.That's what really pulled me in to the film.Many people walk into the theater thinking TDR is going to be this scary, bloody, gruesome film. It's not. There is a proper amount of blood in it, so it might be more than some can take, but I've seen worse.Some of the early reviews on this site were from people who saw a special screening. I remember reading one person's review in which he/she quoted someone at the screening who declared that The Devil's Rejects was vile and ""depraved"".It's not. In fact, as far as crossing some line is concerned, Zombie comes close to defining it, but never crosses it. It is a better assumption to say he gets close but backs off. It is also probably wise to say that the MPAA might have had a hand in that.The music in the film is quite good. The score doesn't envelope the movie and the source music is period accurate. The only problem I had was that Zombie did the full-frame to radio thing twice. (when the song is playing at full blast and then it cuts to inside the car and it's on the radio) Something like that only works once, to me, but that's just a petty gripe.The acting is pretty good. Zombie found a good replacement for Mother Firefly in Leslie Easterbrook. She's creepier than Karen Black, but I would have liked to have seen Black in the role again. I think that, given the direction of this film, she could have done well.William Forsythe is great, as is Bill Moseley, and Sheri Moon isn't as annoying in this flick as she was in ""Corpses"".Ken Foree and Michael Berryman are cool, but in the grand scheme of things, are irrelevant. Diamond Dallas Page and Danny Trejo don't do much either, but they accomplish what the characters need to accomplish for the film.The best part of the film is the end. I can't really say much, but what I'm going to say is that the end of the movie ruined the rest of that day for me. I like it if a film can do that. If you have seen the flick, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't seen it, check it out.Okay, now the bad. And this really made me angry. I watched the movie completely through, past the credits. Near the end of the credits, Zombie thanks Blue Oyster Cult, Rotten Cotton T-shirts and someone (or something else) I can't remember. That just goes to show that Zombie thinks less of his fans and more of the people who can help him make a buck. I just really hate that, because the fans are the ones who gave him a career.

369,imdbjeff,Not as bad as House of 1000 Corpses...,4,2 April 2006,"I am a huge White Zombie fan and I respect Rob's solo work. I really wanted to like these films. Perhaps I expected too much.Sid Haig (any relation to Alexander Haig?) was good once again, but maybe it's because all the other performances were so bad. This movie was a lot less campy than the first one, but apparently no one told the actors. Surprising gem was Priscilla Barnes. This was a gutsy performance on her part. Sheri Moon shouldn't even be allowed to watch movies, let alone act in them. Three of her four movies (all her starring roles) have been projects of her husband (Rob Zombie) and I'm quite sure if I tried hard enough, I could find a tie in for the odd one out. Bill Mosley's character was a flat and boring homicidal maniac. Really. Or, once again, maybe it just seemed that way because everyone else was so over the top.My main problem with the 1000 Corpses was that it was campy and in large stretches, fairly inane. Maybe it was a parody and I didn't get it. Well, the campiness was greatly reduced in Rejects (once again horribly over-acted by most of the players) but the stupidity still runs rampant. I'm not going to even attempt to weed out the plot holes in this thing. Suffice it to say that it now seems to fall somewhere between parody and homage. I'm not sure he was trying to do either. There's really nothing new here as all the plot devices have been used countless times before. This is a horror movie created by someone who's watched a lot of horror movies and said ""wow, cool, I'll put THAT in MY movie someday"". The ending was obviously fleshed out by playing a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey, or more precisely, Tack the Ending on the Movie.I know there are lots of Rob Zombie fans out there who would applaud and scream 'masterpiece!' even if this was a 20 minute video of Zombie taking a crap, but if you took away the Zombie name, you'd have a lackluster B-movie destined for celluloid oblivion. I'd suggest going back to music, but I've just heard the first three tracks from the new album and they weren't too impressive either (the title track is particularly heinous).

A predecessor to his 2003 gore-fest ""House of 1000 corpses"", the film surrounds the story of the sadistic Firefly clan; a family of psychotic cultists who each have a thirst for blood and a knack for bloody violence. The 'family' consists of the whorish Eve ""Mother Firefly"" Wilson(Leslie Easterbrook), daughter and satanic slut Vera-Ellen ""Baby"" Firefly(Sherri Moon-Zombie), burned mongoloid Tiny Firefly(Matthew Mcgory) and brother Rufus Jr.(Tyler Mane). There is also the leader Otis(Bill Moseley) and Baby's biological father/equally macabre John-Lee Johns/""Cutter""/Captain J.T. Spaulding(Sid Haig).The Story follows several months after the events of ""corpses""... the family is tracked down by Ruggsville counties newest Sheriff, John Quincey Wydell(William Forsthe) and are then taken down in a violent shoot-out with many casualties on both sides, and even a capture... however, Baby and Otis are able to escape and eventually team up with Capt.""Cutter"" Spaulding. Together, the trio takes on a road trip to evade the ever persistent and ever vengeful Sheriff Wydell... who goes to the lengths of hiring deranged Bounty Hunters Rondo(Danny Trejo) and Billy-Ray Snapper(Diamond-Dallas Page) to track down the remaining Fireflys and their allies. The movie also stars Ken Foree as Spauldings pimp-brother Charlie Altamont, Michael Berryman as Charlie's sidekick Clevon and features porn mistress Ginger-Lynn Allen.The film is a GREAT improvement from ""Corpses""... the kind of thing telling fans that maybe, ""Corpses"" was MADE to suck and only open up the initial characters story for the sequel which turned out to be a horror-fans ""True-American-Cream-Dream"".

But it was on Cable/On Demand, and I gave it a whirl.The one specific area I'll comment on regards Rob Zombie's use of great American music. He relies on it. Not only is that somewhat bush league -- it's unfortunate for the viewer. Because a strong possible outcome will be that you'll come away from the movie associating the Allman Brothers, Kitty Wells, Elvin Bishop, Terry Reid (English) and others, with blood and suffering.

Last night I was fortunate enough to watch his latest masterpiece The Devil's Rejects and god diggity damn this movie is cool. Now if you didn't like House of 1000 corpses, you sure as hell won't like this one either, so stay away, but if you are like me and loved House... this movie is just for you.I don't want to take anything away from the story, but the film continues just a little while after the first one ends and starts off with some kicking ass action. The characters are meaner than in the first one, but Devil's rejects is a whole different type of movie than House.... I would consider it a Thelma & Louise meets From Dusk till Dawn on the set of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, underlined by what I would like to call the most fitting soundtrack of any movie to this date. The action, the humor, the violence and whatever else is featured in this movie is just over the top and Rob Zombie really shows his artsy and creative side with DR.

Well, they all suck big time, with some exceptions like a few parts from Texas Chain Saw Massacre 1974. So, I expected a lot from the rejects. The movie poster was pretty impressive. Finally, some horror movie characters, not like that stupid, skinny, dressed in black pyjamas dude from SCREAM. But the rest was really disappointing. The fault is on the reviews that I read here, who took my expectations to high. How should I put this? Zombie can direct, but he's no writer at all. The movie and characters are unbalanced. So, they are ruthless, sick criminals, but in the end we should feel sorry for them, because they are still good funny guys, who were kids once. What's with that crap? There is no moral meaning in this, no point to make and it feels unreal. And then is the violence which is so blamed here in some reviews. Yes, there is some blood, and some stupid killings, and some almost unbearable sexual humiliation, but there is not enough dynamism, with camera moves and stuff. Don't get me wrong. You can show less, and make the audience see more. The acting is good for that script. Otis is pretty impressive with that hair and blood dirty torso, and Baby Firefly is mean and beautiful, and scares me to death thinking that a woman can be like that. But, in the way that a horror movie should be, this is not it. For that, go watch HAUTE TENSION, which is made by the french (what a shame) with Romanians actors (in secondary roles) and part Romanians crew. Yes! I'm Romanians.

Although a take off on Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it was extremely fast paced (good for my limited attention span), did wild things with the camera work and did a wonderful job of building tension as the movie progressed.I didn't find this movie nearly as exciting. Following three of the characters from the first movie, it personalizes them . . . makes them human. One of the things that was so scary about the first movie was that the people in the farm house were so inhuman.Ultimately, this movie screams knock-off of Natural Born Killers. Rob Zombie decided to forgo the fast paced and jumpy camera work of the first moving (something that scared the snot out of me in House) for a more leisurely paced gore-fest. Boring.My favorite character, Captain Spalding, isn't even as much fun. He didn't carry the same foreboding sense of violence he had in the first movie (heck, that prostitute had him begging for his life). The character Baby . . . what happened? I had her pegged for a lady that loves pain and she cries just like everyone else.Oh well, I'm sure Rob Zombie has plenty left up his sleeve.",The Devil's Rejects

This was readily apparent in the first film, however less so in the Devil's Rejects, which came across as a more current and less stylised effort - but having said that, no less impressive. This time around, the film was not confined to the family house, giving it a larger environment in which the characters could explore. this in turn allowed the viewer to learn more about the characters and how they ticked, individually and as a family. Speaking of which, the main protagonists are a bunch of over-the-top sicko lunatics, but they do what they do in such a manner that you can't help but laugh and love them in return.

I doubt if anyone else will have noticed this but I saw the movie three times on its opening day and I know what I saw compared to what is on the DVD, maybe Priscilla asked them to delete the scene who knows? Well the .45 in the panties scene was sheer genius. Roger Ebert, who I usually disagree with, nailed this one and said its so deranged that its great. Much the way Romeros Dawn of the Dead was accepted. I predict this film will be a cult classic, like Dawn of the Dead for years to come.

Bill Moseley is very solid and Mrs. Zombie is quite creepy as well. It truly is amazing that this was only Rob's second film, though I must admit I'm not eagerly adding additional Rob Zombie flicks to the queue.The sad fact is I could never watch it again, it was simply too well done.

383,livinitup2589,The Devil's Rejects: Modern-Day Horror Masterpiece,8,29 September 2007,"I gotta hand it to Rob Zombie. The guy knows how to make a horror movie. I haven't seen his first film House of 1,000 Corpses, but I don't really have to in order to recognize his flair for film-making. The Devil's Rejects, the sequel to Zombie's debut, is so strikingly violent that it's hard to watch for more than five minutes. But at the same time, there's a certain diabolical charm to the movie that keeps the sickest acts of human kind very watchable. In a strange way, I couldn't look away.After a TCM inspired opening, we're taken into the Firefly house. As Otis, Baby, and the rest of the clan awaken to the sweet smell of rotted corpses, their house is bombarded by the police, headed by hot head Sheriff Wydell. The family arm themselves with guns and metal face plates, and all hell breaks loose. After a shooting spree that leaves a good number from each side dead, the cops seize Momma Firefly and Baby and Otis manage to escape through the sewers.The rest of the film follows the two fugitives as they shoot, stab and molest their way across the state. Eventually, the two meet up with Captain Spalding, a perverted clown who's just as psychotic as they are. Running parallel to the storyline is Sheriff Wydell's manhunt for the three of them.Taken at face value, this isn't a movie you'll likely enjoy. There's far too much here for the squeamish and the violence is completely reprehensible. But Zombie (a former hard rocker who's self image seemed to be right out of a horror film) handles every moment with such a strong sense of humor that we forgive the movie for much of its ugliness, and begin to enjoy the madness . As unforgivable as some of it is, the movie is somehow able to win us over.There's a chance, a good one, that this is the first movie that I can remember laughing out loud at such incredibly nasty people. Captain Spalding, with his dirty beard and scary clown makeup, is absolutely hilarious. This is funny, considering I don't find clowns to be really funny at all. It seems strange that when I finally find one, he's a homicidal nut job. Otis, the bearded, trigger happy psycho is just as funny because he's so careless and clueless that only he can take himself seriously. As far as Baby goes, she's not nearly as funny as she is sexy. Although I do wonder how she grew up to be so good looking.Besides the fact that the movie mixes so well elements of splatter and comedy, it's a technical achievement as well. Zombie's script is packed with witty dialogue and scenes of true emotion between the characters. He even goes so far as to develop the Fireflys into an actual family, which only works in the movie's favor. His directorial skills are impressive as well, as he seems to have mastered pacing and has a real manic energy with the camera. He's not just another horror hack, but a guy who knows his stuff.While Zombie is the movie's heart and soul, the actors seem to be its backbone. Each actor, no matter how small their part is, is superb at what they're given. As the film's lead, Sig Haig gives Captain Spalding a perfectly believable menace and a strange charm. The scene where he car jacks P.J. Soles (who is terrific in her short time on screen) is just as funny as it is scary because of Haig's ability to be intimidating and goofy at the same time. As Otis, Bill Moseley is second only to Haig with the most scene stealing performance in the movie. As Baby, Sheri Moon Zombie is not as good as the other two, but does a good enough job at being sick and twisted. William Forsyth gets the more conventional role as the revenge bent sheriff and runs with it.Despite its wretched characters and even more wretched content, I think The Devil's Rejects will someday become a horror classic. Zombie defies modern horror in a way that hasn't been seen for a long time. He pushes the entire genre over the cliff of absurdity, and brings it back with an entire new set of rules. There may be no more rules left by the time he's made his next film.",The Devil's Rejects

The dialogs and characters are hilarious and can compete with every Tarantino movie. The movie is constantly breaking thru clichés by being totally ironic and switching between splatter and comedy.

The characters are much clearer as well.

Very large cracks at that, it's playing at the multi-plex! Once upon a time, moviegoers had to watch this sort of stuff in renovated old burlesque houses, at midnight showings or at the drive-in.Reminiscent of ""Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"" and ""I Spit on Your Grave"" in it's unrelenting and unapologetic brutality, Zombie has created an aesthetic that in some ways is appealing to me but in other ways downright horrifying. I was trying to figure out if Zombie was getting off on making the audience squirm, or if he was just getting off. It lacked the kitsch and self-awareness of his first one, which in turn buffered the mayhem.There is no doubt that Rob Zombie is talented (I never thought anyone could make Sid Haige uglier) and I enjoyed the dialog, some of the sequences, the redneck 70s soundtrack but there's something to be said for subtleties(like Psycho, or even Halloween).

Rob Zombie did the unthinkable and I absolutely fell for it. Call me insane, call me sadistic, but I ultimately felt the deepest of sympathy for the Devil's Rejects. Yes, they carelessly murder a woman for her car and a traveling folk band for shelter, but when the vengeful and murderous Sheriff Wydell enters the picture, you can't help but feel sympathy for a family who were raised differently. Yes, killing is wrong, but it is what they do, something they cannot help. Revenge is a great evil and, to me, Sheriff Wydell is the true villain of the film.Also, I was disturbed (in certain ways) by the film, but not because of the film itself, but because 2 people in the theater I saw it in repeatedly laughed at several scenes which were not funny at all. It took laughing at a helpless woman wearing her husband's face and running for her life to get these guys kicked out. No matter how you feel about the main 3 characters, the Rejects eventually transform into normal human beings. It is their torture at the hands of a ruthless pursuer that makes the audience realize that the 3 victims finally cherish each others presence rather than what they once used to do. The finale (magnificently filmed, accompanied by Skynyrd's masterpiece 'Freebird) is where we finally realize that all the family ever wanted was peace, but a love for murder arose. The flashbacks Otis has of Baby and Spaulding in the peaceful field, laughing and enjoying what life they have, is what Otis wanted in the end. This is when I forgave the misunderstood villains. Few other people will feel this way after viewing the film, but to me, it is ultimately the tale of a troubled family whose love for life overcomes love for crime, but too late to finally enjoy it.",The Devil's Rejects

Bloody, sadistic, cruel, extreme, these are all the things that have been missing from horror for the last two years, in which studios and producers have made a quick buck from remaking almost, or soon to be every, horror movie that was ever made. Had enough with the dull Dark Water? The turgid Ring remake? The dire Amtytiville Horror? Assault on Precinct 13? Herbie Fully Loaded? Well, you're not getting away that easy. Also proposed are a Last House on the Left remake, along with a Wes Craven produced 're-imagining' of The Hills Have Eyes (both promise, however, to have a new motor rather than just a fresh coat of paint).What has been 'original' in concept has been just as uneven in quality -Boogeyman, Cursed. PG-13 horror playing it safe to procure a bigger audience and greater box-office clout. Cursed should have been an 18 if anyone wanted a sellable movie, but in cutting and editing out all the good bits you're left with a predictable and un-scary sub-standard Scream clone, but with werewolves.However, The Devils Rejects is one in a steady rise in horror that's not afraid to be horrific, another notable exception being the visceral The Descent. Both are original, subversive, violent and bloody, telling a story without being drowned out by a typical structure that straightjacket's the movie. Rejects pays homage to the controversial exploitation movies of the 1970's such as aforementioned Last House on the Left, Hills Have Eyes and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, without doing the heavy-handed Cabin Fever scene stealing. This movie has the same tone and feel and desperateness of those films but does not duplicate them.From the opening scenes, and having seen House of 1000 Corpses, you are aware of what to expect yet this film delivers something more. All the acting is spot-on, OTT but believably so, not without humour and a Last House on the Left style of camaraderie between the murdering trio. Amoral it is but like the brilliantly vengeful Sheriff Wydell, who steals the show and provides the most entertainingly heated exchanges between cop and killer, it treads the line between justice and revenge, right and wrong, so that it is constantly challenging your assumptions and never giving any simple moral platitudes.Zombie's direction is stylish and assured and the movie has a delightfully frantic pace throughout. The soundtrack does give the impression of these murderers as rebels but it IS a classy collection of tunes, and every shot reminds you that nowhere and nothing is safe. The motel. The desert. The whore house. Even the main characters, in the most interestingly subversive, compelling part of the movie, are tortured by the Sheriff, giving up their uniformly 'tough-talking killer sh*t' after he's blasted a couple of rounds of staple-guns into their chests and applied a few electric shots and literally 'nailed the bastards'. This is the scene where you find yourself routing for the Sheriff as he applies his own brand of 'rough justice', rejoicing in the revenge dished out as they did the 72 or so they slayed. For cool, confident, sonuvabitch Sheriff Wydell is really the only one it is possible to identify with, in the face of their sadistic actions (the scene of the daughter blind and fleeing madly into the road, only to be splattered by a passing truck) and glee at the death they have caused.This movie does not strike up a deep rapport with the family, or ask us to somehow be sympathetic, even if there are some scenes in which the killers actions are deemed almost as heroic (such as in the last scene), but that is also debatable. The slo-motion car shoot-out against cops and killers may seem heroic, but the camera details every bullet that enters the family's murdering bodies as if to say, 'What comes around, goes around'.",The Devil's Rejects
395,sidewinder572,"A depraved, sick and brutal film.",10,22 July 2005,"Alright, I never bothered with ""House of 1,000 Corpses."" Mainly due to the poor reviews and the fact it looked like a ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" rip off. As a matter of fact I wasn't that interested in this movie at first. But the early buzz raised my interest and I went out and saw it.""The Devil's Rejects"" is a sick, ruthless, grab you by the throat and don't let go horror movie. Which is exactly what it sets out to do and it succeeds brilliantly. While the movie is sadistic and violent, the characters are extremely well developed and the movie is extremely well written. I've always felt that Rob Zombie would make a good horror director and while ""Corpses"" wasn't so well received it was only his first film. This is something else altogether.A genre masterpiece and the best movie I've seen all year. If Zombie keeps this up he will become a force to be reckoned with in the horror genre",The Devil's Rejects
396,Pandaloonie,Awesome!!!,10,17 December 2005,"I have not seen 1,000 Corpses and I had no idea this was a sequel of sorts to it. I have seen more horror flicks that I care to count but - this one? It is a damned good movie. It was unique, it was fresh. I loved it, I was literally sitting on the edge of my lounger the entire time. It was put together in a cohesive way, the characters flowed, their comments and actions made sense and it was crazy enough to make you think it might actually happen. One of my children is a criminal psychologist and she walked out after 10 minutes. She said that if she wanted to be reminded of work, she would GO to work. She wanted to be - entertained.I don't recall actually SEEING the copious amounts of blood and gore that some folks keep pointing to. I do recall a lot of SUGGESTION about it, either by the characters talking or seeing some of the photos from the scrapbooks.The casting was a fantastic ensemble crew - I'd pay to watch Forsythe read the toilet paper label - I love Michael Berryman, it was great to see PJ Soles Priscilla Barnes on the screen again, and Mrs. Zombie and the rest of the cast were perfect. They really got into the skin of their characters. It just worked. I saw it as a rather hard in-your-face movie about people and their attitudes, their perceptions of what is acceptable behavior, their morals. Or lack of. It does not glorify murder and abuse, it does not portray the Firefly's in a way to get your grudging empathy and/or sympathy. They were evil people but thought it was normal behavior. One of my children is a criminal psychologist and she walked out after 10 minutes. I admit I was mad at first when I thought they would survive the Sheriff's rage and vengeance and manage to get away with it all. And while he not only fell across the line of sanity and landed on the other side, I was upset when the Sheriff died.This is a great movie for horror buffs - especially those interested in psychological horror. I hope to see more of this quality of film and scripting from Mr. Zombie.",The Devil's Rejects
397,Buffy_2012,Another Rob Zombi great....,9,6 February 2013,"To understand The Devil's Reject's you need to watch House Of 1,000 Corpses first. The event's in TDR happen's a few month's after the events in House Of 1,000. Reprising their psychotic roles are Sheri Moon Zombie as Baby, Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding, and Bill Mosely as Otis. Noticeably absent is Karen Black as Mama Firefly and the late Dennis Fimple as Hugo. Karen Black did not reprise her role due to a conflict over her salary. The role was taken over by Leslie Easterbrook. Although she did a good job playing the psychotic Mama Firefly no one does it better than Karen Black.The overall tone of TDR is darker than House of 1,000. Baby is less giggly and more sadistic and you get an more in-depth look at the inner workings of the Firefly family. Another great addition to the cast is William Forsythe as Sheriff Wydell whose brother was the Sheriff in House of 1,000 that was killed by Mama Firefly. The movie starts with shots of the dead victims in the Firefly home and Otis sleeping in bed with a female corpse. Meanwhile, Sheriff Wydell is on his way to raid the Firefly home. Chaos ensues and Mama Firefly is captured by the Sheriff, while Otis and Baby escape. You then see Captain Spaulding having sex with a hot woman who pulls a gun on him and then...he wakes up. He was dreaming and is actually in bed with heavyset woman. Baby calls Captain Spaulding and fills him in on what has happened. You also find out that Captain Spaulding is Baby's father.The trio end up at a motel where they torture and kill some of the guests. The murders in TDR are more graphic and gruesome than those in House of 1,000. Sheriff Wydell seized all of Mama Firefly's scrapbooks which have pictures and details of everyone that has been murdered by her family. Sheriff Wydell is slowly being driven insane by his grief over the murder of his brother and his need for revenge. His revenge starts with Mama Firefly.I won't spoil the movie by revealing the detail's of Wydell's revenge on the Firefly's, but he does get his wish. There are some interesting aspects to this movie in terms of getting a better look at the Firefly family. There is one scene where Baby and Otis are fighting over getting ice cream to which Captain Spaulding sides with Baby. There is also a dream sequence towards the end where Baby is dreaming of her Captain Spaulding and Otis as a normal family.This movie is NOT for the weak stomached, teens, or kids. Turn out the lights and enjoy the journey!!",The Devil's Rejects
398,Rabiddog,Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Natural Born Killers,8,14 January 2006,"I saw The Devil's Rejects yesterday and I liked it a lot but my first thoughts were that the movie remind me of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Natural Born Killers and From Dusk Till Dawn (remember the motel scene?. Although Rob Zombie did a great job, a lot of splatter, great effects, good acting, everything what it takes to make a great movie. And how boy, Sheri Moon is an awesome babe ;)... I really hope she survived the final shootout with the police, so we can see her in the next Rob Zombie...

399,Phil-531,Sequel Lacks Originality and Charm of First Film,3,24 July 2005,"Having enjoyed House of 1000 Corpses more than any other horror movie I have ever seen I went to see Devil's Rejects with very high expectations from Zombie. I was very disappointed. The use of strong language, which was employed wonderfully in the first film, was over used and eventually completely superfluous to the film itself. And while the violence was as brutal as you would expect from Zombie it seems his imagination ran dry in this second film. You can only be shocked so many times by the sight of a fleshy human mask. Even the characters were not as involving or interesting as they had been in the first film. If it had not been for Sid Haig giving us the Captain Spaulding we came to love from the first movie, it would have been completely worthless. Portions of the film seem to drag on endlessly, especially the scene with the movie expert rattling on and on about the Marx Brothers. I left the theatre feeling almost cheated; the invincible and completely insane characters, which were charming in the first film, had become these motiveless violent foul-mouthed vigilantes that I was loath to watch for two hours. In summation, Rob Zombie took a wonderful cult horror movie and added to it an insidious sequel that is not worth the price of admission. Wait for the DVD, then find a coupon for a free rental is my suggestion.",The Devil's Rejects

If you like pointless mayhem with torture, beatings, blood, gore, torture and more gore with some cute nudies tossed in, this is the movie for you! Could be better if they took a shower sometime, and didn't seem to enjoy living in grease and filth with scattered decaying body parts. I found this movie a bit disturbing, but the scantily clad and cute nudies made it worth watching once, for guys anyway.

401,chococat-1,"Vile, Gory, Disturbing - GREAT!",10,7 June 2006,"Slasher movies aren't my specialty, but I do have to say this is a wonderfully done movie. The extra care Rob Zombie took in learning the craft of film making shows in every aspect of the film.The ambiance, the characters, the story, it's all wonderfully written and shot. The premise is vile, the killing is gory, the family dynamics are disturbing. All together, you can't help but admire the effort this cast and crew put into this film.If I had to give any points off, it might be for Baby Firefly - at times she's a little stiff. HOWEVER, when you're that BEAUTIFUL, it really doesn't matter what you say or do, I'm totally caught. Can't wait to see her again.Spending the extra money on the soundtrack definitely pays off in this case. I can't take it out of my rotation of IPOD listening. Kudos for Rob Zombie's taste and ability to match a scene with classic music.It may be completely disturbing to those that don't watch such movies, but you must see this film. It's FABULOUS! Nothing could really top it if Rob put together another movie of the same family.I'm interested to see Zombie's next effort as a film maker.",The Devil's Rejects

It's a sadistic, yet fun romp with some of the most unique, funny, and insane characters you will ever see on the screen! The film is gritty, raw, and in your face just like the wonderful 70s cinema. This film is blatantly violent and tests your psyche and you will know where you stand by the end of the film...whether or not you cheer for the clan, or you are disgusted and vehemently oppose their actions. But even with all the raucous that ensues in this film, one cannot deny that this work is very fun to watch and is impossible not to laugh at many of the funny lines contained in the film. But, if you are against violence, swearing, and sick humor, by all means stay away from this film because you would not understand it anyway.

If blood, gore, and sincere violence turn you off, do NOT rent this movie, you ill HATE it.HOWEVER, if you liked the original Texas chainsaw masacre, or any of the other renegade gore flicks from the 70's, this movie ill be your video aphrodisiac. Zombie does an amazing job of mesmerising you with an intensely powerful recreation of the film quality of the old school gorefest movies. this is everything you could have wanted from a gore flick, and then some.the effects are definitely great, and quite realistic. the scene on the highway was immaculate... the personification of gore, and shock. true, for some reason you just see what is about to come, but it still just makes you want to back it up, nd watch the frame by frame (flawless effect by the way)it comes down to this. if you want an extremely violent, and profane movie. extremely adult in nature, and extraordinarily gory in nature. there are intense scenes of sexual violence (epecially in the special features). if all of this sounds like something you would want to watch, then by all means, go for it. but if your squeamish, you should walk right past it. and don't judge it against the previous installment, house of 1000 corpses. the to share only a few characters, and little else. the method of storytelling, the writing, and th whole concepts behind them are completely separate.",The Devil's Rejects
404,vreemdmuzikantje,A dangerous movie for the stupid among us,8,2 September 2006,"It's not a bad movie, keeps you nailed at your seat, doesn't get boring. But I was getting an nasty feeling about the way the characters enjoyed killing. The fun the family had in killing innocent people was dangerously contagious. This movie almost made me go out, buy a gun and start killing people. (of course i would never do it). The problem is that this movie is making violence look like a good thing. The way the family loves being cruel, the way they laugh about it, the stupidity of their victims, actually all the fun and no moral at all, gave me a dangerous feeling. Luckily there was a pay-back time and you could see how they could suffer as much as their victims did before. You could also see how a 'good man' could turn into the same kind of murderer. And that's maybe the point of this actually really good and 'gore' horror movie. Everybody got it, just depends how you grow up and what happens to you in your life. Still a sick movie, but nice to see some 'real' revenge. But my advice to stupid people who like violence 'DON't WATCH THIS MOVIE', you could end up killing somebody.",The Devil's Rejects

I'm also not particularly drawn to the horror genre, not that Rejects even comes close to fitting inside the box. It's so much more than just another horror film. For me, Rejects is one of the hardest earned 10 Star reviews I've ever written and one of my favorite films of all time. First off, I read somewhere that Rob Zombie went from first to final cut on a $3 million budget in 30 days. This, paired with a lack of any big-name talent, is nothing short of a triumph for the relatively inexperienced director Rob was at the time, as well as the extremely talented cast and crew. Second, Rejects (obviously) is not for everyone. However, those is it for are in for one hell of a ride. That being said, don't let the bad reviews deter you. Most of them must be written by people who, simply put, just ain't down with the sickness. So all you freaks, whack jobs, psychos and weirdos living anywhere on the fringe, the edge - and especially those of you who have fallen or leaped off the side of the cliff -buckle up and enjoy. Rejects is custom made to speak directly to you in your own insanely special way. However you interpret Rejects, it's safe to say that it's a multi-headed monster that can snap the strongest chains and shackles that bind a film when it's relegated to a specific genre. Much like it's target audience, it's too oddly complex to be limited by general categorizations. Last thing, if you haven't seen the prequel - ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" - watch it first. Many of the same characters, completely different monster. If, for whatever reason, you don't particularly enjoy House Of 1000, commit yourself to watching Rejects afterward anyway because it is an ENTIRELY different film. If there was ever a prequel and a sequel that were unrecognizable to each other, it's these two films. I know people who loved both, but I also know people who weren't in to House of 1000, but loved Rejects. Don't Rob Zombie yourself out of the joy you'll reap from Rejects because you weren't feeling House of 1000. My best comparison would be how I feel about The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. The Terminator was cool, no doubt. Now Terminator 2 though, beyond EPIC!

With this said...I knew Rob Zombie could make a great movie...watching him in the various interviews he's done, and his incredible knack for style, I knew he had a great movie in him. So imagine my not being surprised to find that The Devil's Rejects was one of the most enjoyable movies of the year. Albeit it isn't for everyone. It is a disturbing movie on so many levels. With this said however...the acting is fairly good...except for Zombie's wife, and the dialogue was witty. The other thing that struck me in this movie is the soundtrack. It isn't often that a horror movie doesn't have a grind you to the core heavy metal soundtrack.

This ''sequel'' is nothing more than some bad mixture of ''Doom Generation'' and ''Natural Born Killers''. Story is shallow, characters from first movie have totally loosed their charisma and identity, and turned to be more bare psychopaths than grim, twisted but humorous maniacs from ''House of 1000 Corpses''. Comparing to the first movie, violence we have here is more brutal and raw, but with such approach Rob Zombie didn't achieved anything interesting. Many scenes are pointless, and some are without any cause too long. End of the movie is more than stupid, but let people judge that by their own. Anyway, ''Devil's Rejects'' fails to be good movie. Only good thing about this movie may be that it showing the real mediocrity of People from the suburban of America's south, and their mentality, pointed on that only weapons solving all problems.

By the way - gory? When I was reading all your comments here, I was like: Oh, Zombie made a bloody, disgusting movie, brutality all the time of the piece, etc. I was thinking: Well, at least it will be really messy, and I wasn’t expecting anything extraordinary smart and puzzled, thrilling, let’s just say I was expecting blood. At least anything that would make me say it is worth seen it, when the script is so bad anyway. And I haven’t seen any gory movie a long time ( don’t get me wrong, I’m not the sixteen years old guy who is into killing scenes, that times just passed away :D ), so I was curious. But – nothing happened. You damn dumbsters. Don’t get people horny to see this when posting your super extra hyper comments on a movie like this. Nothing really interesting happened there. The plot is so sad that I had to stop it three times to get a beer, because it was just so boring. There are two or three scenes which could be called violence, brutality or something like that. I don’t wanna to make spoilers, but it’s true. 3 scenes in a big “horror”? You must be a really big fan of Rob to enjoy this one. Couple of redneck idiots, whose every sentence contains 18 swear words are running away, they terrorize the motel, then they ran away again, they are caught. I would say no more. But this is it. The whole plot. Pathetic. And back to the gore, as some of you are singing about all the time – there is just minimum of it. Nothing is to be seen, except for some blood. This is the bloody horror movie made in 2005 or whenever? Man, what a low budget must Rob had. There, some of his fans would say he was not making a big gore score film, but a movie about cruelty, attitudes to life, revenge and how evil should be punished? To hell with that. This is just a flick which is very overrated. I have seen much more better movies than this. Rob has had better movies, too.

While on a violent road trip, they're pursued by a sheriff seeking revenge for the murder of his brother and seventy-four others.As we'd expect, the movie is relentlessly gruesome and sadistic, never shying away from violence. People are nailed to chairs, impaled with a hatchet, and raped with the barrel of a gun. Even though its intention is to be unflinchingly brutal in its horror (and succeeds), The Devil's Rejects has none of the aspects that make a decent horror flick; it isn't scary or suspenseful, it's simply nasty. That might be appealing to some, but the rest of us expecting more won't get it.The main characters are truly awful human beings, and it takes a much more skilled writer/director than Rob Zombie to keep us interested when we hate everyone. Sticking around for their comeuppance isn't worth it, either, since the sheriff has lost just as many of his marbles as the killers.If there is a bright side, it's that the movie captures the feel of old exploitation films very well. And surprisingly enough, the acting isn't quite so bad, even good at times. The writing is clever every now and again, too, but it uses profanity as if Zombie had a quota to meet.And whereas most homages are decent enough, this is almost as bad as the type of movies it shows affection for.

Rob Zombie also loves to show off his wife it seems because in all his movies not only is she the star woman but she also can't be in it unless she shows skin.

Some parts where just plain amazing (my mouth dropped). This movie showed the twisted way of life of 3 sick individuals. Even though it shows the evil side of the human race it also shows the good side as well. This movie was so well directed i didn't know who to root for. At times i wanted Otis and Captain Spalding to just beat on innocent victims. Then other parts I wanted the them to kill mercilessly. Possible Spoiler... The way Rob Zombie developed the characters that were killed in the hotel was unreal. No other movie develops victims. This is why Devil's Rejects is such a classic film. Rob Zombie shows the evil in the human race by showing how such ""badass"" people kill innocent civilians. The Main characters of the story are murdering people of everyday life, such as people that are going to see Zombie's film. This is why this movie is so incredibly good. Another Possible Spoiler...Towards the end of the movie where The Rejects were about to be exterminated, i kinda was rooting for the Cop to finish these bastards off because of all the innocent people they have killed. When Tiny snapped the cops neck, i also felt a sigh of relief. These twisted emotions of both sides make this movie so AWESEOME i cant even explain. The end scene of the road block was unreal.

But I heard better things about this one, so I went in with an open mind. Unlike Rob Zombie, who does not seem to have an original, or even fresh thought in his head. Otis the crackhead psycho from ""House"" becomes a Charlie Manson wannabe in this one, and Sheri Moon is the least convincing ""bad"" girl I have ever seen.This film first rips off ""Last house on the left"" with the humiliation/rape/murder scene in the Hotel, with the vapid Sheri Moon ordering one of the female captives to hit the other in the face, hard. Lady, you ain't no David Hess. You are not fit to lace up Jeramie Rain's Keds, for that matter.We meander to an out of the way bordello, so that we may crib from ""From Dusk til Dawn"". The film tries to marry '70's grind to films such as ""Natural born Killers"", with flat attempts to mimic Tarantino-esquire witty repartee. Bill Mosely might have been up to that task, but remember, he's channeling Charlie, and has proclaimed himself the Devil. I guess he's too hardcore for humour.We have a sheriff who seems to be a direct rip-off from the cop gone bad from NBK, and the Dennis Hopper religious, insane Texas Ranger from the funny TCM sequel (Forget which one, hope you get the point.) We also get a Pimp, a ""Bandito"", and other stock Tarantino characters.Finally, this crap ends in a ""Bonnie and Clyde"" style shootout. Sheri Moon is also no Faye Dunaway.Every thing Zombie did in his two movies was ripping off every thing you have seen before. Some call it homage. I call it complete lack of talent.There's a good deal of gore, and of course violence, but Zombie tries to paint his villains as anti-heros, and fails utterly, so the grind is all for naught. Oh, and Rob? Thanks for ruining ""Freebird"" for me.Zombie's movies seem like an excuse to give his old lady some work. I grew weary of seeing her posterior. Sheri Moon, you ain't no Tiffany Minx, but porn is surely where you belong.Caveat Emptor on this one.",The Devil's Rejects

Rob Zombie's Best Film",9,15 June 2014,"A must see for anyone who loves to see something new in horror and can stomach sadistic films.Characters are well developed, the film is very dark and twisted, and editing and effects are of great quality. Acting is perfect, the actors did an excellent job their second time around (House of 1000 Corpses is the first film, pretty good but the acting was not as solid). Every scene was well shot; Zombie had a very clear image of how he wanted everything in this film, as usual with his material.

420,Darth_Zombie,Partly good but there are some character and tone problems,5,26 July 2005,"I'm a little torn on this movie. I think maybe I wanted to like it more than I really liked it. Parts of it are great, and parts of it are not so great. It definitely rose above 1000 Corpses in terms of character development and cinematic style. Certain scenes are put together real well, and there are some very intense moments.I think my biggest problem with it is that it felt like it's supposed to be sort of a fun, butt-kicking romp on a certain level, and it was a little too grim for that to work. The tone just didn't fit in with the severity of the situations. I've got no problem rooting for bad guys, or having anti-heroes that you root for, hell, I've written a feature script about an anti-hero serial killer. It's just that these anti-heroes are kind of hard to root for, or to even care about at all, because they're absolutely awful, disgusting human beings. You just don't like them, or I didn't anyway. Sure, Baby's hot and somehow kind of appealing in a psychotic sort of way, but Otis is just a sickening display. The character is played brilliantly by Bill Moseley, and it might be his best role ever, but that character needs to be the bad guy in a movie. That was one of the weaknesses of 1000 Corpses - there were no good guys that you gave a crap about. You didn't want them to make it through alive. The bad guys were so much more interesting, which is always a slasher flick trait, but these killers were so much more developed than the one dimensional good guys that you just didn't care what happened. Devil's Rejects is like that too, but there aren't even any good guys to watch to see if they make it. William Forsyth's sheriff character is great and he nailed it, but given the choice of him catching the Firefly family or the Firefly's getting away from him, I really didn't care which happened. I felt like they just took all the different bad guys from lots of different movies, and threw them all together in one story. Like I said, the characters are interesting on their own and well developed, but when you don't have any foil for how nasty they all are, it's easy to not care about the outcome of what's going to happen. I have the same problem with movies by folks like Sam Peckinpaugh - that nihilistic approach where all the characters are disgusting just kinda gets old and leaves me wanting more characters I can identify with. There are plenty of movies with characters who are immoral or criminals or whatever that are likable - Tarantino is great with this for example - but Devil's Rejects didn't pull that off very well in my mind.Some highlights - it was really nice seeing so many horror icons in one movie. Michael Berryman and Ken Foree were a great team. Sid Haig is very good, once again, and delivers some pretty good lines. The duo of Danny Trejo and DDP was pretty awesome, too. It also has a kick ass soundtrack and some very cool camera-work in places. It's a little too ""shaky cam"" at times, but a lot of the hand-held stuff is pretty effective. The Freebird section (to not give too much away) was also very effective although maybe a little too drawn out. If I had had felt more in touch with the characters it might have been even more effective. There's a nice little tribute to Empire Strikes Back as well that was pretty funny.Overall, it's a mixed bag. It's fun to see this cast go all out and be the most insane bunch of lunatics you've ever seen, but it's very brutal, dark, and nihilistic. If that's what you're in the mood for, then check it out. It's certainly not for everyone. The sheer brutality of it will turn off lots of folks. I haven't seen so many walk out of a theater since House of 1000 Corpses. Somehow I just wanted to like the characters a little more. Maybe I wasn't in a deranged enough mood when I saw it. I'll give it 5 stars out of 10.",The Devil's Rejects
421,hob63,One long MTV music video,1,19 September 2005,"I can only assume what I watched was a MTV music video, since the apparent film contained no horror and more importantly no plot, but some classic tracks. Thats the only thing that kept me watching the film, the music. On to the movie, it starts in much the same way as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, (for the first few minuets) then its downhill. There is no plot, a character is thrown in here and there at will, the acting is poor, the fake Texas cowboy accents added liberally through, laughable at that, there is no scary theme or scenes and the only reason this film is given a cert 18 is due to the closely pornographic scenes and liberally abusive swearing, so liberally thrown in it has comical value, suffice to say most people will give this film a 10 but then with modern Hollywood films it probably was the best they have seen.

The scenes evoke the brutal slasher feel of cult hits like Texas Chainsaw and Hills Have Eyes (Michael Berryman is even in it!). It also has an interesting message, just watch how your emotional reaction changes through the film. In my theater you could feel the gasps change to adulation, as the role of victim and victimizer dramatically shift. Where once you felt revulsion, you then feel excitement. Zombie's message is clear, our bloodlust is just as strong as that of the psychopaths on the screen -- we just have a different perspective on who should be on the receiving end.

423,evil-drdeath,"A great follow up to ""House of 1000 corpses""",8,28 January 2006,"This movie,the second work from (ex?)rockstar and director rob zombie,follows up his debut.The story starts where the prequel left,with Tiny dragging the corpse of the last victim of the family,and seeing the police coming to the house.After a shoot out with the police with Rufus being killed,Mother Firefly being caught and Otis and Baby fleeing.This is the start for a really different movie from the prequel,a violent on the road movie,focusing on the themes of violence and revenge.This movie marks the maturation for Zombie as a director.I really enjoyed the first movie,psychedelic,original and strange but maybe too weird on some points.This one cuts off the psychedelic element (or at least confines it in a very small number of scenes),focus more the direction,boost up the character development (in particular the sheriff),the dialogues and the story,which is really interesting and unpredictable.This movie also has many inspiration from many non-horror films like ""The wild bunch"".The directing style is more mature and less confused,inspired by the '70 movies.Some ideas are re prised from the first (like the particular use of the soundtrack) and used in this more mature context,some others (like Dr Satan subplot) are eliminated.The second part of the movie (wich focuses more on the revenge side of the story) and the ending is simply amazing. The acting (especially from the sheriff,Baby and Otis) is wonderful and fits really well in the movie. I suggest to watch this if you liked ""house of 1000 corpses"" and to watch it even if you didn't liked it,because it is really different from the original. Thumbs up!",The Devil's Rejects
424,slicktones2000,Most Disturbing Movie in Years,6,7 August 2005,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES THE ENDING OF THE FILM, ALONG WITH A THIRD ACT PLOT DEVELOPMENT.Let's get one thing straight about Rob Zombie: the man has film-making talent. This is evidenced by the variety of idioms, stylish references and techniques employed in his two flicks to date. There is a certain ambivalence one feels while watching Zombie's second installment in the twisted escapades of Captain Spaulding and company, however; while I found myself applauding the auteur's command of the horror genre, I also found myself wondering how The Devil's Rejects is doing anything, in the name of art, expression, social importance/cultural relevance or anything else to make the world (and the world of film) a better place. How can one, for example, relish the jaw-dropping sadism of Otis, cheer the remorseless bloodshed of Baby, then wake up the next morning, flip on CNN and bemoan the human rights atrocities that pervade the globe in real life? Whether or not there is an actual rape scene in the film (debatable), or whether you subscribe to the notion that the real world and entertainment/fantasy are and should be mutually exclusive, there is no denying that Zombie has crafted characters and scenarios with no redeeming human value whatsoever. And one has to wonder exactly what Mr. Zombie's intentions are, or to take it further, what exactly is Mr. Zombie's vision of the world, and where his art fits in that world? Whatever the man is doing here, there is no question that he is pushing the envelope big-time.If someone has endured a real-life traumatic personal tragedy--a loved one murdered senselessly, for example--I would imagine this film will thoroughly incense, disgust, and quite possibly traumatize. Unwittingly, perhaps, Zombie is glorifying such reprehensible behavior through the grisly exploits of sexy, charismatic and ultra-cool characters. (It must be noted that the portrayal of Captain Spaulding by veteran Sid Haig is pure genius. It is HIS film.) It has been suggested that the ending--curiously lauded as some kind of cinematic masterpiece, while offering nothing original for this reviewer--underscores the director's conviction that Captain Spaulding and friends are, in the ultimate analysis, horrible people who get what they deserve. I disagree. I think the ending is a whitewash cop-out, in which the malevolent trio are affectionately immortalized and celebrated, much in the spirit of the films Zombie ripped off here (Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and Louise, etc.). Baby takes a bullet to the arm, but otherwise her flawless features remain intact amidst a massive barrage of gunfire, at least as far as we can see. Why not show us how this death romp through a desert police gauntlet REALLY plays out...I had to watch the Mansonesque Otis do horrible things to innocent people with his knife, his gun, and God knows what else, now I want to see what justice and retribution really look like, not some slow-mo crap with a tired Skynyrd tune blathering away in the background. You wimped out, Rob.Finally, it's hard to forgive the transparent plot beat that brings the deformed Tiny back into the mix for the inferno-driven finale. Any idiot saw that coming a mile away, and the scene, to be frank, rings false (and forced).I shudder to imagine any of the following viewing The Devil's Rejects: children, teenagers, people who cannot stand to witness suffering, whether imagined or real, and any person of any age who is emotionally unstable, prone to psychosis, or even just highly impressionable. This is a film for well-adjusted, mentally healthy adults who can process what they've seen, take the movie for what it is, then return happily to their everyday lives. Even then, I'm not sure how a normal, healthy person is supposed to react to this film: ""Gee, that sure was fun! Let's see it again!"" I can't help but feel that despite The Devil's Rejects' success as a basically entertaining genre piece, it is a socially dangerous film, given the violent/nihilistic river that flows freely through our current zeitgeist, as well as the innumerable encroachments upon the sanctity of (any type of) life which exist throughout our modern world. Sorry for the moral guilt-trip, Mr. ,uhhh, Zombie...but this is some disturbing, sick &*%$, buddy.Let's just say you ain't gonna be up for the Nobel Peace Prize anytime soon, my friend.",The Devil's Rejects

This movie is more typically cinematic, whereas ""Corpses"" was a little more cult like. It works very well and is indeed ruthless and brutal. The insanity of Spaulding, the brutal nature of Otis and sexy, seductive and evil charm of Baby all work together so well, to produce a true horror movie. The final scene, to the music of Freebird was a truly great scene, almost emotional. I found myself almost choked up!!

The end?""). Movie #1 was some kind of an introduction of the bad but somehow stylish characters and especially Captain Spaulding was my favorite just after this funny scene in his ""ghost cabinet"" at the beginning of ""Ho1000c"". Now the Sheriff comes to the sympathetic family Firefly and he comes with about 50 ""supporters"" whose are interesting in finding or eliminating all members of that sick clan after f. Firefly had killed the sheriff's brother in ""ho1000c"". The sheriff has different reasons for coming after them, one is that he thinks he could be the right arm of god who has to accomplish justice. His revenge against them and his in-satiate urge to find them after they could come away is not so ""legal"" as a sheriff usually should be. But nor are Otis, Babe and Captain Spaulding that are on a ""trip"" and that enjoy their totally sadistic games with other people. They, as the movie, are ""unfair"" and without any moral. But so is the sheriff. And everyone else in this film. There is not one ""normal"" character, all are insane, stupid or in some other kind ""disordered"". That's crazy - but cool. The atmosphere of the movie is just well-arranged, the characters each one special in their own way.

Again, Sid Haig was excellent as Capt Spaulding. The others have stepped up their performances as well. **Spoiler Alert** (sort of) The one edit I would have made was the scene about chicken f*c*ing. Really lame and unnecessary. **End Spoiler Alert** Again, Zombie proves he can cross barriers.""...Rejects"" is by no means a great horror movie, its just a big improvement from its predecessor. Rob Zombie has a talent for horror. As mentioned, the opening scene, a matter of seconds, is perfectly pure horror. The movie would have been even better had it contained more scenes like that.

I checked this film out on IMDb before I rented because I hated ""House of 1000 corpses"". Now that I have seen it I am stunned that it got a 7.0. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??? This is simply an exercise in sadism. There is nothing enjoyable or suspenseful about cruel, nasty material done in an ugly way.

435,Yakko77,Sick yet Amazing,10,25 July 2005,"HOLY S#!T!!! What a sick and twisted movie! I loved it!!! The first movie, House of 1000 Corpses written and directed by heavy metal singer Rob Zombie was a crazy movie. Not so much scary as it was just plain FREAKY but still one of the ultimate horror movies ever! This movie was also freaky but instead of aiming to be a horror it seemed to be more of a chase and action movie with some thriller moments here and there.It is without a doubt one of the most twisted movies EVER! You don't really root for the bad guys but at the same time since they are the main characters you can't help but be interested in what they're going to do next. This of course involves several brutal killings, sexual assault, theft, more brutal killing, drug use, etc. etc. This movie shows violence in all its terror but at the same time, didn't glorify it. I don't know how Rob Zombie pulled it off.There is this cop who is going after the ""Devils Rejects"" (the main characters/villains) whose brother was killed by these crazy bastards. At first, he's trying to follow the rules for the most part. After a while, tragically yet justified in a sick way, he becomes what he was fighting to destroy. Part of you thinks, ""You dumb bastard, you've become what you're fighting against"" but the other part of you thinks, ""THAT'S RIGHT! Give those bastards a taste of their own medicine!!!"" As I said, one sick and twisted movie.The movie ends in a very violent way in a ""blaze of glory"" that is in slow motion which just adds to the violence of it all. Seriously, this movie was more violent than Saving Private Ryan in many parts. If you're looking to see one of the most twisted and sick movies ever, then go ahead but be warned, it is not for everyone. The movie theater was TOTALLY SILENT when it ended.

The characters are all entertaining, with funny dialogue, and you even begin to like some of them, despite their sick and ruthless ways. Also, the soundtrack is great. Almost every song on there is from the '70's ; there are almost no contemporary artists on it, outside of the band from the movie.Finally, this movie is gory, and it will have you at the edge of your seat wondering what violent act is going to happen next.

437,Sheekus,"Not as bad as House of 1000 corpses, but still bad",5,22 July 2005,"First off this isn't a horror film. It's a failed attempt at a sadistic thriller and a bad rip off of Natural Born Killers and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2. Rob Zombie completely discounts the fact that House of 1000 Corpses existed by skipping over the underground ghouls and the likes of Dr. Satan and instead goes right onto his new slightly related waste of time. The whole cop brother searching for revenge is pretty much exactly the plot premise for Texas Chainsaw 2 with Dennis Hopper playing Lefty Enright. Now from this point the movie doesn't follow that road exactly, it jumps off the path and goes on a poorly done Natural Born Killers spree. The film spends most of it's time in a hotel room accomplishing nothing and eventually goes nowhere filling the rest of the screen time with completely sadistic and predictable crap. Zombie really makes the hour and fifty minute run time feel like forever right up until the last scene, about the only good thing in this film is the soundtrack. Other than that there are a few laughs, gained from laughable characters and ridiculous dialogue (note the sheriff grabbing the movie know it all by the collar to scold him about saying negative things about Elvis Presley). This type of banter leads me though, to the obvious point that this movie isn't supposed to be taken all too seriously and it's meant to pay homage to 70s hack and slash films. Unfortunately in a time when Texas Chainsaw and Dawn of the Dead were just remade and original films such as High Tension, Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever, etc are being released constantly, there's no need for something this unoriginal to be in theaters claiming to be all the things that are lacking in horror films today.",The Devil's Rejects
438,DanM519,"Sick, Twisted and Fun",8,20 July 2005,"I watched House of 1000 Corpses a couple months ago after I heard about The Devil's Rejects. I thought the style was interesting and the use of music was good, but overall my reaction was a resounding ""meh"". I thought the best thing he had going in that movie was the Captain Spaulding character, which was extremely underused. I thought the set up for the character was great, but after the first half hour or so, he just kinda disappeared until the last 30 seconds of the movie. I was excited to see that in TDR however, Spaulding, along with Baby and Otis (two of the better characters in House) were going to be the focus of The Devil's Rejects. So how was Rejects? Sick, sick, sick, sick, and twisted, to the point we're I'm almost ashamed to say that I really liked it. Its not a perfect movie, but I think that it was such a big improvement on House, that I was willing to turn a blind eye to its imperfections. While people noted that House seemed like just another Texas Chainsaw Massacre rehash, this has more of the feeling of a road trip comedy (albeit a tad gorier), which is enhanced by the surprisingly well written interactions between the Fireflys. There were parts that felt reminiscent of From Dusk Till Dawn and one bit that seemed almost like it was borrowed from a Roadrunner cartoon (you'll know it when you see it).In terms of gore, despite my cries of ""sick"" in the previous paragraph, there wasn't anything I found myself unable to handle, but I did notice some members of the audience walking out at some of the more gruesome moments.There are a few bits here and there that run a bit long, but for the most part the movie is well paced, and as I said before, although I'm almost ashamed of it, I really enjoyed this movie.",The Devil's Rejects
439,KipWellsFan,"Blasphemy, Sex, Rape, Murder, Torture, Drug Use",9,23 July 2005,"What Movie am I describing? The Devil's Rejects of course.This film is leaps and bounds ahead of Rob's first work, House of a 1000 corpses. If you didn't know, Rejects is actually a sequel of sorts to 1000 corpses but it is nothing like 1000 corpses. Rejects is an always offending Revenge/Exploitation flick which doesn't delve into the paranormal as its horror predecessor did. Rob Zombie challenges the standard good vs evil plot line to the extreme and is sure to offend thousands of now traumatized audience members who were expecting to see another Boogeyman or Amityville Horror. This is the film which for me cements Zombie as one of the top horror directors and a rival to Japanese cult legend Takashi Miike. The acting is across the board great from William Forsythe to Diamond Dallas Paige, and I'll give a golden star to Sid Haig, Ken Foree and Bill Moseley(who deserves an Oscar). Oh and did I mention it is frickin' hilarious, of course if you're not in utter shock. The musical score is also fantastic and Zombie got rid of those annoying montage sequences. The only complaint I have was with the slo-mos, I sometimes get peeved at the use of slo-mos and this movie uses a ton of them and I fear that in further viewings they will get to me. Rejects will leave you questioning many things, the characters, religion and your own reactions to the film. If you have a strong tolerance level and are a fan of quirky and or horror films there is no reasonable excuse for not seeing this before you die.Genius.9/10",The Devil's Rejects
440,altrgod,western/thriller,7,23 July 2005,"When I went to see this movie I expected that the suspense and violence would be top notch, yet I was sort of let down. First off I would not classify this as a horror flick, it was more of a thriller/western/revenge film. The devil's reject group was more subdued this film, less killing, not to dramatic when they killed first lady all the way to the lady running with her husbands face on hers. I mean hell when tiny escapes at the beginning (avoids being captured) you know hes going to do something in the end to help the TDR out. That and the only people I would classify in this film as psychos were otis and the sheriff, they did most of the killing. I have to hand it to the lady who played Mother firefly she was acting like a total nut/psycho and it was great all the way til she got hers really made he character believable. Baby just sucked, no laughing, just acting like a 8 year old most of the time (plus being able to throw that knife through that ladies chest plate, crap!!!). Captian spaulding was pretty much the same character from the first although he seems to have it more together in this film, plus it showed hes not above harpooning whales. Otis was more like a lunitic woodsmen with that beard of his. The sheriff reminded me of some crusader nutjob who was just as violent, but somehow holy. But other than that most of the characters were just to bland to be remembered, too static. Hell I didn't even remember the bands that was killed nor the people killed, or why I should have even cared about what happened to them.Too much of this movie just did not sit well with me, it just wasn't what I was looking for. I would say i liked HOTC more because of the pure violence and satism (I know zombies not a Satan lover, besides that stuffs BS) That and bullcrap ""we got the drop on you"" then messed it all up.Hopefully Mr. Zombie keeps making films he seems like hes caught onto the right track to revived horror moviesl, though next time leave out the god damn 5 min montage at the end.",The Devil's Rejects
441,john_life,"A tense, gory flick nearly too discomforting to watch but impossible to turn away from",10,23 January 2012,"The Devil's Rejects follows the Firefly family during their attempt to escape justice at the hands of a vengeful lawman, who lost his cop brother to the killers in ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" also directed by Rob Zombie. The differences between the two movies are obvious. ""1000 Corpses"" was trippy and surreal but seductively engaging. ""Devil's Rejects"" is as stark and unflinching as Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" and ""Cross of Iron,"" two ultra-violent action yarns that make its viewers wince or even cut off the movie. As you can imagine from that description,""DR"" is almost hard to watch. The violence isn't over-the-top; the dialog between the characters isn't seductive or playful. If ""1000 Corpses"" was about a slow descent into hell, it's sequel ""The Devil's Rejects"" is hell spilling forth on to the earth. Make no mistake about it: you will hate the Firefly family throughout the movie, at least after the initial gun fight with the law at their ramshackle shack, but you will find yourself held breathless during the film's final scene as they face death with an élan and courage usually reserved for war movies with clear moral right and wrongs, black and white.",The Devil's Rejects
442,joshreluctant,"Zombie's newest so far, the best of the year.",9,26 July 2005,"Rob Zombie's ""The Devil's Rejects"", picks up right after House of 1000 Corpses, but the first noticeable change is the style of film-making. House of 1000 corpses was a trippy horror ride into the deepest, maniacal depths of zombie's mind. If Ho1000c was his ode to seventies horror, this is his ode to the likes of ""Easy Rider"", ""The Wild Bunch"", and ""Natural Born Killers"". The first thing I think I should mention is Phil Parmet's BRILLIANT desert photography. Not since ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"" has the desert looked so sparse, dead, yet seemingly alive. Zombie's desert is a character in the film, brought to life by Phil Parmet.Performances were also three times better than the previous entry. They seem a bit more lighthearted, but at the same time, in their most sadistic scenes, they seem like the serial killers they brought to life in the first film, except much more violent. Otis is at his most cold blooded when he goes for a ride with his two captors. Sid Haig supplied all the much needed comic relief to lighten the blistering tension. Such as the ""Top Secret Clown Business"" scene, or riding in the car with the family. But don't get me wrong, he has moments of pure badass. And I think it's obvious by now that Rob Zombie likes to show off his wife's rear quite a bit. So thanks, Rob.The supporting cast is by far, the most stellar ensemble I've experienced since ""Sin City"". Every single figure is either a world renowned badass, or a cult horror figure. Danny Trejo (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn), DDP (WCW\WWE wrestler), Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead, TCMIII, KnightRiders), Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes, Beastmaster 2), and Matthew McGrory (The Dead Hate the Living!, Big Fish). It's a cult horror fan's literal dream. Brought to life by Rob Zombie.Of course, William Forsythe's Sheriff Wydell, is the newest addition to the Corpses main cast, and he is amazing. He brings back vigilante justice, a cop who crosses the line a bit too much, with vengeance on his mind. I haven't seen such a character since Clint Eastwood in ""High Plains Drifter"", and it is ultimately refreshing. Any scene he's in, I'm feeling bad for the person he's about to beat senseless.And of course, who hasn't heard of the amazing ending. A gun battle set to Lynyrd Skynyrd's ""Freebird"". Let me tell you, it was entirely different than my friends and I thought it would be, but nonetheless stellar. It's probably one of the best scenes in any movie from the last decade. It is truly sunning. I'm not going to spoil anything, but this scene alone is worth the price of admission.Long story short, go see it if you want to kick back at some of cinema's best history, mixed with very little contemporary influence, though there is some. 10 out of 10. An amazing piece of celluloid.",The Devil's Rejects

Its hard to believe that they were both written by Rob Zombie, because they are almost two totally different films. The acting was incredible and the storyline and plot was brilliant. Nice job, Zombie.My favorite scene would probably be the beginning when they escaped, although I didn't like that Mama was caught.

He gives us a family of twisted serial killers that we watch do brutal acts of violence then by the end of the movie when freebird plays he has made it almost impossible not to hope they get away with it.

448,fireheart412,Perfect 70's Style Killing Spree!,10,21 July 2005,"I had the pleasure of previewing this movie a few days before its official release. While I enjoyed ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" I think this follow-up sequel was far better. ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" was more like a carnival freak show with supernatural and unbelievable scenarios, whereas ""The Devil's Rejects"" was quite realistic and very brutal. This film is in the vein of ""Helter Skelter"", and 'Otis' pays homage to Charles Manson, even hauntingly resembling him. ""The Devil's Rejects"" is full of bloody carnage, perversion, filthiness, vulgarity, and the characters are sadistic and relentless serial killers. It is not for the feint of heart or the squeamish. There are some clever and quite humorous lines in the movie, along with some very disturbing ones as well. Sherri Moon Zombie gives a stellar performance as 'Baby' that is quite unforgettable. It was great to see P.J. Soles (Halloween) in this film, still looking beautiful as ever. Leslie Easterland, 'Mama Firefly', really gives an excellent performance as the perverted and disgusting mother of the clan. All of the actors did an amazing job in this movie and were very convincing as their characters.The cinematography of this film was really brilliant, and uses the 'swipe' and 'freeze-frame' methods, sometimes resembling a comic book adventure. The music was classic seventies rock, and fits well with the road trip theme. The gore was spectacular and realistic, and sometimes even disgusted me at times, which is hard to accomplish. I gave this movie a ""10 out of 10"" because it is full of spectacular, clever, and gruesome horror-movie fun! It contains scenes which seriously make the viewer cringe and feel sympathy for the victims, while hating the serial killers. I've never felt so much hatred and disgust towards the villains as I did during this film, and that goes to show you how convincing this movie really is! If you like Rob Zombie, seventies slashers, and a good horror movie plot, with edge of your seat/nail-biting scenes, then this is the movie for you!

449,chloehorror,As a Rob Zombie fan;,10,30 July 2015,"As a Rob Zombie fan, whatever I post will sound cliché' I guess? Nevertheless, I thought i'd put my opinion across about this movie.I'll just start of by saying one thing about this movie I kind of hate. In fact, it's the only thing i dislike about the film. Otis Driftwood's appearance is completely different from the Otis from House Of 1000 Corpses. Yeah, I gather Rob wanted to change Otis so he had more of an 'Albino' look to him, but I personally feel Otis looked more badass in The Devils Rejects. I think Rob Zombie did a fantastic job with The Devils Rejects though. I mean, it's not over the top with all of the gore and killing, Rob knew where to stop without it looking a bit exaggerated. Captain Spaulding is an unusual character, but he is my favourite. In Robs movie 'House Of 1000 Corpses' Spaulding is neither good or bad. He's lovable but also quite dire. In The Devils Rejects, Spaulding is a stereotypical evil clown which I kind of love. This film shows a lot of loyalty revolving around family which is kind of rare to see in horror movies these days. It's a movie that I find quite tasteful because the gore, the blood etc isn't over used and it doesn't look so cliché' and stereotypical. I mean, this movie is a great example of what happens in everyday life. I honestly do love The Devils Rejects though, no question about it.

It is as if we are seeing a live cam of Charles Manson and crowd back when he had his murderous run.This is a very chilling movie. You will not be disappointed if you are into the horror genre. Also, this movie is not for the squeamish. I would not watch it with a first date. In fact, some people may wonder about you if you tell them how cool this movie is and how much you enjoyed watching it. Better to keep your praises to yourself.I can't see this type of movie being done any better. Zombie does not overdo anything. I watched it thinking anything depicted has or could happen in real life.

This is nothing but a shock factor film that Rob Zombie duplicated off of true horrific events, put it on film, and labeled it his own creation. This guy is not a talented film writer or director, the only reason he has an opportunity to make films is his musical background. He's no better than the rap artists who make crap films. There are a few things I like about the film. For instance Capt Wydell, I don't think they ventured enough into his character, and I also think the story would have ended a lot better if he had gotten his revenge on the three murderers. (I was cheering him on the whole time during his torture scene with otis,capt spaulding and baby). But no, instead the ending is some piece of junk Thelma and Louise kamikaze and thats that.

455,pick_bass,Best Horror Of The 2000's,10,31 March 2010,"Horror recently has fallen into a rubbish slasher genre which gain all of their scares by using cheap loud noises and by having something quickly jump at you on the screen, no real atmosphere of fear about anything other than when your going to have to cover your ears. (Despite being a good film a perfect example of this would be Drag Me To Hell)I was incredibly surprised with this movie, Rob Zombie really did try his hardest and delivered on all aspects...acting, story, violence, scenery (most of the movie was shot on location and not in a studio). At the time in the cinema it was just a great horror movie to me but it wasn't until about a year ago that i started to fully appreciate the movie.Ever since the movie has came out, most of the reviews or opinions i have had off of other people appear to be the same, they are decided that they do not like this movie, thats fair enough but a large amount of people full on insult the movie calling it a simple gore fest to disturb the audience and has no real purpose or story, these points i cannot help myself to disagree 100%.The story seems simple at first...the brother police officer of a victim of the family swears revenge and decides to hunt down the family and arrest them...as the story goes on you see that arresting them is not his main objective he wants to torture and kill the family with extreme rage, going as far as hiring bounty hunters and going rogue from the police force. On the other side of the story we have the family Otis, Spaulding and Baby heading to meet another family member so they can hide and relax.It seems very simple but the way in which the story develops is what makes it work so well...throughout the movie you see the family torturing and killing people, there is no way you can sympathise with them at all they are just the most disgusting human beings, and Officer Wydell (the GOOD guy) you can understand his rage and root for him to hunt these people down and kill them. As the story goes even further on you see the human side of the family, sitting down together and enjoying some relaxing time, drinking a beer and partying...you understand that they are human beings able to feel fear, happiness and every other emotion but are still bad people. Officer WYdell slowly starts to become so obsessed with catching them that it appears he is losing his mind and as the film comes to a climax you truly believe he has and begin to root for the family.Thats why i liked the story so much it appears to take an entire 180 on the whole thing, turning the sadistic family into the victims and you start to feel sorry for them. it would seem impossible half way through the movie for you to believe you would feel sorry for these people, but the officer despite going insane you still root for him as well, so you are unaware who the good guys and the bad guys are and it leaves you with an original feeling which i had not really felt in a horror movie before.The cast is brilliant, Otis played by Bill Moseley is so captivating as is the clown Captain Spaulding played by Sid Haig. We have cameos all over the place, but not cheap and comedic...its a big tribute to all horror with the cameos...even all of the minor characters are so entertaining to watch whether it be the Bounty Hunters played by Danny Trejo and Dallas Page or simple victims...almost every character in the whole movie would make a fun spin-off movie.The music is great, Rob Zombie used music from bands that were famous during the time of the movies setting, and if there is one thing that is Rob Zombies strong point it is setting a scene to music, he seems to be able to take a relaxing song and put it to a scene that is full of disgusting violence or suspense and make it work really well.So now i will defend the movie against some of its haters who seem to be taking a dislike to the movie and turning it into a needless attack on the movie, if you don't like the movie thats fine but there is no need to make reviews claiming stupid statements such as.""Seriously – anyone who legitimately identifies with a band of whiny, backward serial killers with dirty hair and a shared brain needs to do a reality check."" That was part of the movies progression, to take us away for a while the 'dirty haired serial killers' and show us something more human so we can hopefully view them as more than just killers.""we learn absolutely nothing more about the Fireflies this turn around"" Anybody who says this clearly do not understand the movie at all...the development is very clear as i have already explained.I understand the idea of watching a movie for entertainment, and most people view this movie thinking its going to just be that...but few seem to look at the film and analyse the aspects that Rob Zombie went for, it is not a simple bloody movie made to shock the audiences, it is a well done, gritty low budget tribute to old movies like Last House on the Left and Easy Rider only with a proper named cast and decent intriguing story and some slight preachy undertones on violence morals.It still remains as one of my favourite horror movies, and stays high as my favourite horror movie of the 2000's.",The Devil's Rejects

All I can say is.... I liked her. I really, really did. She wasn't the kind of charming serial killer that Hannibal Lecter is, but she's just so twisted and amusing that you can't help but love her. It's not often that you find a woman quite this evil. There have been a few in real life, like Myra Mindley, but she was ugly. This girl is gorgeous, one that every guy wants. She's so damn irresistible that you can't help but take her up on her offer to erm... ""entertain"" you, despite the fact that you're really ugly and old so there's quite clearly something not quite right about the whole thing. Ah, the foolish man. Didn't you watch Fatal Attraction? If you're going to cheat on your wife, at least make sure the mistress isn't psycho. Anyway, that's her dealt with. The brother is such a goddam hick, it makes my skin crawl. He reminds me a little of Henry's (portrait of a serial killer) friend, who also happens to be called Otis. He's the sort of generic deranged serial killer you might expect in this sort of film. I liked the touch of him cutting off the guy's face and making his wife wear it. Nasty. The second creepiest character is the big fat clown. Although the his first scene (the dream) almost turned me on (haha) he was really just revolting. Those teeth... *shudders* and I don't like clowns at the best of times. That's all I really have to say about him. Definitely the creepiest character was the mother. Trying to be sexy is hard when you're a freak (just look at Paris Hilton - zing) and she really didn't pull the smouldering thing off. She was a fantastic character, though, and extremely well acted. I don't really have much to say about the others, (the police officer, the massacred family, the pimp etc) except that they were nothing special, but also nothing awful. Now for the juicy bits. I thought the whole concept was brilliant, the characters were brilliant, and the direction was brilliant. I loved the effects, however, I would have liked to have seen more of their history. I said this about FearDotCom too, but I feel that a film always benefits from a little bit of history. We saw newspaper cuttings etc, but the whole content of the film was to do with their escape and final obliteration. Call me sadistic, but I'd have liked to have seen some victims. Aside from that, everything was fabulous. I loved the ending, the way that they fearlessly stormed the police officers, with absolutely no remorse. I kind of wanted them to come out alive, but that would have been totally unrealistic and I would have bitched about it.

You get just a little peak inside of each one's psyche which is very effective in creating a true sense of horror.Perhaps I was predisposed to like this movie only because William Forsythe was in it - anyone who tries to kill Steven Seagal (Out For Justice) is OK in my book!

I love the Firefly Clan series; something about the cinematography, the unexplainably perturbing house of corpses, and the endless lineup of larger-than-life characters is so unique and refreshing. Seeing how depraved this family is as they mutilate their victims and unapologetically laugh in the face of death is mesmerizing and so much more enthralling than the typical supernatural horror! I love Rob Zombie's films, so whenever someone asks me which movie of his I would recommend, I always tell them to check out the Firefly Clan trilogy!",The Devil's Rejects
461,elmundodelundo88,The devils rejects is an awesome movie-not at all scary!,10,4 November 2006,"I saw this movie about 3 times and I thought this movie was a blast, it was 100 times better then house of 1000 corpses, this is not a horror movie. Its almost like bonny and Clyde.And 1 more thing on top of that its 10 times less violent then house of 1000 corpses (but still violent enough =p)Captain Spaulding does not actually kill anyone in this movie, He was my favorite character in the movie. Baby was almost the same as in house of 1000 corpses, but she has a little more of a brain.Otis......Yes of course Otis is the most brutal of them all as I thought, he does some pretty nasty stuff =(.My favorite part of the movie is in the end where they all got shot down from the police, I had no idea that was coming.My favorite movie!",The Devil's Rejects

Over the past 20 years there have been so many horror movies, that it will be very hard to think of a new reviving idea. But to be honest: does the genre really needs it? No matter how many movies you have watched, the idea of crazy cannibalistic psychopaths, is still very joyfully to watch for us real horror fans. Now the first movie from Rob Zombie (House of thousand corpses) was utterly superb. It is easy to spot, that Rob Zombie is heavily inspired by Tobe Hoopers masterpiece: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A lot of movies are, by the way (The hills have eyes 2006, wrong turn, 2001 maniacs, highway to hell and so on). His second movie is a little bit surprising, but equally as horrific as the first one. I really like captain Spalding; and Sid Haig, who plays the role of the sadistic brother of Sherry Moon Zombie, really deserves an Oscar for his acting!!!! Rob Zombie: I demand a part III!!!

This isn't escapist horror, this is the evening news.The scariest thing about this movie is the clown guy's teeth. Is there a dentist in the house? There's no intensity, no suspense, no opportunity to become invested in any of the characters.Brutal maybe. Occasionally funny for which it gets a 2--but very occasionally. It's as if it was written by an 8 year old boy who just discovered the F-word.Overall, a meh for the whole Zombie universe.",The Devil's Rejects

None of the actors are believable in their freakiness because they're just a little too cute and coherent.

It is meant to be a no holds barred event, and for the most part it succeeds... If you have seen ""House"" you can see Zombie's growth as a writer AND as a director in this film. Hopefully, there will be more movies coming our way from him.I have to say, though, that I was slightly disappointed because Otis and Baby just didn't seem quite as looney as they were in the first film. And that was part of its originality and fun.Final word......If you are a fan of horror, go see this film!",The Devil's Rejects
467,tanzka,By far Rob Zombie's greatest work,9,8 September 2010,"I went into this movie expecting nothing because my only grasp at Zombie's work was the Halloween remake which I felt to be ridiculously stupid. What I found however, was well worth its' while.The story follows the same characters as did House of 1000 Corpses which I haven't seen but luckily that doesn't hinder the ability to enjoy this movie one bit. The Firefly-family wakes up one morning learning that the police have surrounded their house and are after them. This begins a deadly chase which centers on the Firefly-family and the Sheriff John Wydell. Devil's Rejects offers a few surprises and at least one surprisingly hilarious scene which I find oddly delightful coming from a Rob Zombie movie about a homicidal family on the run from the law.I loved this movie and chances are you might like it too, it isn't perfect but then again, who is? Definitely worth checking out!",The Devil's Rejects
468,Echo12b,Very disappointing,4,25 July 2005,"I was a huge fan of ""House of 1000 corpses"". I've seen it more than any other movie. So naturally I expected this to be as good as the first. I was wrong. The movie started out well, with an excellent gun fight, but it slowed down after that. Then, towards the end of the movie, they get captured by Sheriff Wydell's brother, and the movie tanked. I respect what Rob Zombie does, and I am as big a fan as the next guy, but what was he thinking? He ruined the characters that we fans had grown to love and fear. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding turned from cold-blooded killers to complete pansies when they were tied to a chair and slapped around a little bit. These guys are supposed to be the ""Devil's Rejects"". I would have thought they would take what they were given and ask for more. Nope. It was terrible. The only thing that kept me from asking for my money back was the final scene, when the rejects redeemed themselves by going at it with the police, out-manned and out-gunned. To put it simply, this movie was very disappointing.",The Devil's Rejects

I tried to submit this be was told I had to have 10 lines of text, but I truly do not know how to write more about this movie.

470,Dante_Filth,Dignified Rob Zombie,10,5 October 2005,"Rob Zombie's vision of carnage returns with profound amelioration as his directorial route takes measures toward greatness.In this follow-up to the not so well received, House of 1000 Corpses, the Firefly family is on the run from authorities following a faltered ""seek and destroy"" police raid... and to top that off, a sheriff driven by fueling hatred and ambition for revenge and redemption for his brother's murder.Rob Zombie has written an incredibly tense and witty flick and even better, brought it to life in all it's glory. From the kick-ass one liners to the subtle, yet effective humour, to the marvellous soundtrack, so meticulously used--right down to the final awe-inspiring sequence.There's violence, but not redundant, just enough to have you talking about it afterwards. It's not very gory, it's mostly just tense--in the way that what the main characters do mislead your thoughts into believing it's ""gory"". But I mean, c'mon, you're watching 3 loose serial killers on the run, if you can't tolerate mediocre violence, then what are you doing even considering movies of this genre.Anyway, this is one of the best of 2005 and one of the few great movies left in our time frame. Not only does it take a 180 turn away from House of 1000 Corpses, it lives up to all the hype I've been hearing, and even exceeds that.10/10.",The Devil's Rejects

However if you don't then my advice is stay away because this film is guaranteed to disturb you.The film opens up at the Firefly ranch in Ruggsville not long after the massacre featured in the first film, House of 1000 corpses. The county sheriff and all the local authorities move in and.....i won't say anymore. The film is about Otis, Captain Spaulding and Baby going on a kill crazy rampage around the desert, at the same time avoiding the police at the cost of other peoples lives.Now, as i said before, if you are a horror fan or a Rob Zombie fan then you will love this. But this film is not for the faint hearted or the squeamish. But the film is fantastic. Brilliantly shot with a fantastic soundtrack. Rob Zombie is a genius!!

472,bigbudgetplease,Awful.,1,22 July 2005,"The film is choppy, terribly shot, the dialogue is at times a Tarantino knockoff and at its worst...well terrible. The main characters are depicted as ""anti heroes"" and yet we hate him, or at the least, don't feel very close to them because of their crazy nature. So we are presented with a hour and half movie about three characters we don't care about. Add a choppy pace, gratuitous violence and nudity (but not in the homage sense like the violence in Kill Bill, but overdone, unentertaining, unfunny, and purposeless violence and nudity), and some dizzyingly awful cinematography and you have The Devils Rejects in a nutshell. If you like Zombie's work you might like this film, I don't, and even with an open mind I wanted nothing more than to leave the theater.",The Devil's Rejects
473,PhilParma,I liked this movie better when it was the Texas Chainsaw Massacre...,4,26 July 2005,"... Well, it's not quite the same, but, it has the same feel.The Pic is basically about a few serial killers on the run from the law. They kill or damage anyone that comes across them, essentially setting the scene for them being true bad-asses, and pulling off such atrocities that only the most depraved would find appealing (though you might chuckle at the lines of dialogue, especially from their leader, Captain Spalding).Then, about 2/3s into the film, the gears switch, and it turns out that these killers are being hunted by a vigilante of sorts, and all of a sudden we're supposed to be cheering for these monsters! Well, it just didn't work for me. These characters were set up to be such heartless fiends, and then, a little torture later, they're practically crying, and so vulnerable. It just doesn't make any sense, nor does it really effectively make you empathize with them. Some people might actually cheer on the vigilante, who is clearly supposed to be hated -- he just looks evil.Now, a friend of mine pointed out that this kind of switch happened in A Clockwork Orange. This is true, however, remember two things; 1. What happens to Alex is against his will, really, and an entire society turns on him, showing he can't live in a world where he's harmless. 2. Rob Zombie is no Stanley Kubrick.Apart from the shaky handi-cam work, which doesn't really bother me, Zombie pulls some rather pretentious movies. For example: musical montages. Many of them appear, and are so drawn out, that only a fool couldn't see what was going to happen. The finale is similar. It is almost as though Zombie just really wanted his movie to end with Freebird, and then just wrote any old ending he felt like. It's a shame, really, because the first 2/3s of the film were all right. Not spectacular, but all right... but it goes downhill so badly.Also, I don't know how kosher it is to show how in love you are with your wife through film-making. It feels like every other shot has Sheri Moon Zombie's ass in it. Selah.",The Devil's Rejects

Justice was eventually served and you can't help feeling satisfied knowing the family finally got what was coming to them especially after all the sh*t they had gotten away with.

OK! the movie moved a little slow for me. must complain that baby has absolutely no acting skills. anyway, it took a while for the movie to gain some steam, but when it finally did i actually found myself cheering at what was happening.for fear of giving anything away, i will just say that 1000 corpses and the devil's rejects are two definitely contrasting like black and white. doubt there will be many people that like both. you will like one or the other.i hated 1000 corpses but really enjoyed the devil's rejects. take it for what you will.",The Devil's Rejects

I ....... Have .............to ......... Use. .........10....... Lines to post my comment. So in addition i would like to say that house of 1000 corpses was really cool esp. when Otis was outside with the cop and he waited a whole minute before he shot him and i really hope there is a part three!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The sequel for the gory ""House of 1000 corpses"" (which is also a good movie) leaves behind all the unnecessary exploitation and it's more about the characters.In this movie Zombie really puts himself in the work of creating a film.Yes! It's violent, there are some scenes that are not meant for the weak of heart, but the movie it's not only about the violence, there are a lot of more violent movies out there. And if you can make it through those scenes, you will really be rewarded.The editing is great, the music is great and the ending sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in my life.So, in few words this one is a lot better than the first one.",The Devil's Rejects

This movie has a wonderful talent roster of character actors, with some surprising names. The only glaring omission I've noticed in the previous reviews was the soundtrack. From OLD, classic blues, to some classic funk, to classic rock, the soundtrack ALONE is worth the price of admission, and not to be missed!Musically, Mr. Zombie and company are on top of their game, as usual!

482,samtepesfour,It was fun!,4,23 July 2015,"Reviews on this one range from extremely positive to extremely critical and some people have pointed out that the movie has not one good character that you can root for and that there is too much sadism and gore and all of that's true. Which is exactly why I found this sleazy brand of Texas Chainsaw rip-off entertaining. And to be honest though I wasn't exactly rooting for anyone here, not even the demon-slaying cop who thought he was their true nemesis, but wasn't that the whole point of the movie? It shows that it doesn't matter whether you're fighting on the side of god or the devil, as a human being you're capable of the same kind of brutality, gaze long enough into an abyss and all that. That's the true message. And it's delivered in the raw and entertaining, B-movie form Rob Zombie is famous for.Otis and Spaulding's dialogs were hilarious and certainly the highlight of the film along with its amazing soundtrack.So to review the movie, this was kind of a TCM (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) derivative but I don't think that there's anything wrong with that and so long as they keep me entertained I can watch as many versions of it as I can get my grubby hands on. Overall the movie was shot better than the last one (House of 1000 Corpses) and since it was focused entirely on the family we actually get to see some more character development in this one.To kick off we see some of the gruesome shots of murders committed by the family and we see that the police are surrounding the house. There is also some TCM inspired cop walk-through the family residence footage and news reports, which show that the police are now closing in on the family home. The action scenes that follow include an exchange of bullets from both sides and there is no sign of Tiny and no one can seem to find him. Baby and Otis make a run for it and manage to escape but Mama Firefly gets arrested. Baby alerts Spaulding who is in the middle of a very-graphic sex scene (emphasis on graphic.) The gore was outstanding—from realistic looking corpses to a victim being splattered by an oncoming vehicle like in a cartoon—that part waswellcruel I suppose but it was all sort of dark humor to begin with and this part was no exception.It's hard to say who my favorite character was because they're all nuts. But I think I preferred the Baby and Mama Firefly from the last movie. Baby especially was better in the last one because you see so little of her and with more emphasis on her character this time around, it's a bit of a distraction because one thing that Sherri Moon Zombie can't do, is act. Regardless, she fulfills a very important role in the film, namely show off her fabulous body in a variety of ways and that has to count for something right? She wasn't so bad in the action scenes with the kind of camera angles that Rob Zombie decided to use and she's definitely a good screamer.The only problem that I had with the movie is that the last one clearly had a whole supernatural aspect going on and even then it wasn't really explained what those beings were. I was hoping to get some more of that in this one too, actually find out what the hell was really going on. There was also very little emphasis on the whole Dr.Satan aspect which was a true waste because Dr.Satan could have been the next Leatherface. It had the potential, I just don't understand why it was barely even mentioned. The other thing I had a problem with, is also connected with the supernatural aspect: *SPOILER ALERT* With all those weird things living under you it should have been something supernatural but there was no such thing in this movie which could have been a plot twist but wasn't for me. I kept waiting for the family to not die easy or something.*END OF SPOILER* Viewed separately from the last movie though, I suppose this is very much like a Western with gore. I think when you use one too many face masks made out of people's skins, the horror just becomes less but again, that's what we expect from a B-movie and Rob Zombie definitely nailed it.",The Devil's Rejects
483,chanticlere,"House of 1,000 Corpses fan?... Rejects will be rejected!",1,23 July 2005,"Having faith that Rob Zombie would continue his heavily stylized film making into the second effort ""The Devils Rejects"" I expected to get my money's worth out of this film. I was wrong and feel horrible for defending zombie and having such faith in this film.Needless to say, ""The Devils Rejects"" just doesn't seem to fit with the first one. The feel is completely different, I know Rob had intended that. My problem is that the characters even lost their charm. If you loved Otis, Mother firefly, Baby, or the ever Lovable dirty mouthed Captain Spaulding, you just might not in this picture. The comic attempts to break the violence are worthless. Random insults and meaningless arguments with dirty words can't break a smile amidst the exploitation of victims. The first film had a better formula to break this tension, don't expect it here. The BIG difference...the violence is much more real. Instead of escaping the daily world and being put into a redneck rampage sideshow, you are thrust into a vile world of violence and exploitation without purpose. It's obvious this film is homage to the 70's exploitation and revenge films only now you will hear more complaints because it is in the public eye unlike those of the 70's. I was embarrassed to see a child no more than 9 years old leaving with his dad. (note, they looked pretty normal not like the film characters.) On the good side: Just as the first film, this left me with many MORE insights. Good vs Evil an that borderline or level where there's indifference, questioning the pleasure we get from revenge and why it heals old wounds, and finally.... your rights as Americans to bear arms and do whatever the hell you want... as long as you're willing to face the consequences. It took the first hour of this film to pass before I could settle down and breath easy enough to think about these things.It doesn't change that ""The Devils Rejects"" is very well made and it doesn't follow suit of the first. Rob would have done better to use different characters for this film and keep these characters out of the exploitation theme, it just doesn't' fit them. It is the only reason I give this film such a low rate. The firefly family was seductive and sadistic but, never showed a hint of sexually violent. It should have been left that way. They've gone from funny backwoods rejects with some secret project to very human, brutal rednecks with no godlike ability to seduce, just kill and manage to not get caught even public places that obviously someone else must have been in. A lot of flaws but, you have to admit it was well made. Even a few days later... I'm thinking... I have to see it again to be sure. Maybe I will. Most people will need to take a shower after watching ""The Devils Rejects"" to try to get that dirty feeling out of their skin, I only fear it's not enough.",The Devil's Rejects
484,staggerlee97,A change for the better,10,1 August 2005,"This movie was actually one of the most heart warming and visually artistic films I've ever seen. Rejects changed the way I watch movies and look at life. The way Zombie uses freeze frame, slow motion, and music are some of the best uses I've ever seen. Particully in the final scene as The Reject's shoot it out with the cops in slow-mo while free bird plays. I know it's corny but I shed a tear. I must say that Zombie's style is brilliant.The emotions this movie makes you feel are all over the chart. I hated the cop as he tortured the Rejects, and the ice cream scene was down right wholesome. Well, except for the language. I saw the Rejects in a whole new light as they joked with each other like they were the sadistic southern version of the Brady Bunch. The way Spaulding tried to protect Baby in the torture scene made forget all the brutal murders and feel sorry for the Rejects. As I left the theater I honestly felt like a new man, and really thought about the movie. Whether Zombie meant for this movie to make you rethink your views on people like the Rejects or not, it really did.",The Devil's Rejects

I went to the movies last night to see it again (which I enjoyed even more then the first time) and I didn't hear one bad commit. I cant believe people say bad things about this great movie. By the way, did you laugh as much as I did when Otis cracked jokes. I thought his character was brought to life in this one next to the first.

486,hatlooksp,There's only ONE reject here...,1,16 May 2010,"The only reject from the devil is director Rob Zombie himself. Such a god-awful man in the department of performing arts, and even worse in film-making. He really thinks he's something with entering the horror genre, and trying to mimic those who have come before him. He knows NOTHING about film-making, and this film, along with it's equally as bad first prove that very well. There is no style or real substance to this film. It's a mere copy-cat of thousands of drive-in B movies that were released back in the 1970s. Zombie ties to use the title as a way to explain people in society so bad that even hell will not have them. Ha ha, nice try. This film is what is so bad hell will not have. He essentially goes berserk and overboard in attempt to bring about some chocking and fun campfest of a story-line. it doesn't work. His story is familiar and boring. Not an homage at all. Just stupidity and essentially, artistic plagiarism. God, he even utilizes genre actors as P.J. Soles, Mary Woronov, Michael Berryman, and ultimately, Sid Haig in an uber embarrassing role as a clown faced killer. One can easily tell just how dumb Zombie must be to make films as this, without any real knowledge of how to do it right, let alone at all. Cinematically, the film has nothing to offer except with bad execution of how you do NOT make a film. How do films like these get the greenlight? Oh yeah, Zombie has money and a following. I remember now. That, he may have, but it does not mean he also has talent. He certainly does not have any of that.Zombie has continued to make films since this. How very sad that companies and financiers will let him do this. Even more, how disgusting that people have paid the kind of money for films such as this, that will warrant more films of the like. Gross and obscene. What is the average spectator amounting to? One thing is for sure, this film is also rejected by the devil. Even he knows how bad it is. He knows all about how bad his name is as it sits in the title. Zombie is the only reject from the devil that stands here on earth...a more real hell than the one we think of otherwise...",The Devil's Rejects

This film has a timeless style about it, thanks to strong echoes of 70s classic shock flicks. What makes this film for me, as is the case for many good films, is the characters. I'm happy to spend two hours of my time in their company. Well, not literally of course. That would be ill advised, given their evil nature. Anyone who fashions masks from their slain victim's faces should be generally avoided. Rule of thumb. But that unfortunate character trait aside, I cannot think of a more entertaining bunch of souls than the Firefly clan. All helped by the fact that the actors are relatively unknown, to me anyway. An aside; if you're going to have a psychopaths in your film, don't cast them with a famous actor. When I see Hannibal Lector, I don't see a deranged killer, I see Anthony Hopkins. Anyway, where was I? Ah yes, getting along well with the Fireflys. The ever amusing Captain Spaulding, the intensity of Otis and of course, Baby. Ah yes, Baby... The film is also helped along by excellent performances from opposing characters, the victims, old friends, Danny Trejo's Rondo and of course, the obsessed Sheriff John Quincy. I don't know if there's a secret sadist in me but following the family and watching their antics wasn't exactly what I'd call horror. Familiarisation took the edge off the violence and made this film viewable for a wider audience. It will be interesting to see where Mr Zombie goes next. Can he follow up such a success?",The Devil's Rejects
488,blood-guts-and-gore,A Horror Masterpiece,10,23 October 2005,"Absolutely amazing from start to finish. Even better than the original, more gore, more violence and more action. This movie is a must-see for all horror fans. Great acting by Bill Mosely, great directing and writing. With out a doubt this will put Rob Zombie in the ranks with the likes of John Carpenter and Wes Craven. I think Sam 'Evil Dead' Raimi would be proud of this gore-fest. I especially loved the ending, very dramatic and it was the perfect way to top off a perfect sequel. If I had to say one thing to some up this movie it would have to be 'Evil Dead+The Texas Chainsaw Massacre=The Devils Rejects'. This movie is a no-holds-barred horror classic. In my opinion this movie is worthy of an Oscar, if you haven't seen it yet, sit back,relax and prepare be scared out of your mind!!",The Devil's Rejects
489,turkeyman,A must see for ALL Horror fans,10,12 November 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is a must see for all fans of the Horror genre. I purchased the film, on Friday and watched it. My mind was blown away! I am almost 16 now, and I have been watching horror films sense I was 4 years old, and I got to say this; This is the best horror film I have seen! See films like this, is the reason I want to be a director. For the people not into the genre, it still is a movie you need to rent. The people who complained about the profanity, nudity, and violence need to zip their lips. They have probably seen, heard, or done worse than this stuff, The movie is made for entertainment, and thats what it is, Complete entertainment.",The Devil's Rejects
490,waynea-1,Beginning and Middle were OK but the end Sucked!!!!,4,21 February 2006,"I watched this movie because a friend from school said it was awesome. So I rented it and it wasn't a total wast of $3.97. The beginning was good and so was the middle not very ""Brutal"" or ""Disterbing"" for that watch ""Last House on the Left"". I'm not a fan of Zombie's need to pay homage to possibly the best horror movie ever the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and I loved seeing all those horror legends in one movie. as it says in my summary i liked the beginning and the middle and i loved the beginning of the end. I hated the killers in this movie and watching them get their asses handed to them by those hit men made the movie. The end were it seemed the sheriff was going to get his revenge all the torture he used on the killers i was on my feet cheering. I told myself ""if this movie ends with the sheriff killing all of the killers this movie will be good"" but of course that stupid tall thing comes along and runes the end, of course all of the killers do die but its an empty death. DAMN IT!!!!!",The Devil's Rejects
491,reklesh,Worse than the first,6,3 March 2006,"I'm going to have go ahead and disagree with you there...I'm not exactly sure what everyone else is raving about. To me 1000 Corpses was great because of it's imagery-the walls covered in skulls heads, the costumes, the tortured bodies, etc. This movie is missing all of that. Instead it's a road trip and while torturing and murder still occurs it's not as scary as the first movie. This movie is more of standard horror film, they torture and murder people in an attempt to escape the police. I was terrified after watching the first and disappointed after watching this one. I enjoy gory movies but I went in expecting not be able to fall asleep and instead I had trouble staying intrigued.",The Devil's Rejects
492,JackieOhh,authentically scary,10,9 March 2006,"i was terrified in this movie. i thought it was a riveting thriller, but i'm also quite concerned about rob zombie's young audience. there were many pre-adolescents in the audience. i realize the film is r-rated and it is the guardian's responsibility, but i was greatly unnerved. the film is ruthless in its portrayal of anti-human characters, true misanthropes who gleefully torment their captives. zombie has proved he can give a strong gut reaction without necessarily resorting to complete outlandishness. this film reminds me a bit of Badlands in its starkness, how odd that its heroes are so incredibly unredeemable.",The Devil's Rejects
493,slikrx,A solid movie NOT FOR EVERYONE!!! (but great if you like this stuff),7,29 June 2005,"I went into a screening of this movie completely blind. I hadn't seen 1000 Deaths, and I haven't even seen any of Rob Zombie's videos. (I do like his music,BTW) I had essentially no idea what to expect.This movie is what ""Natural Born Killers"" *TRIED* to be. It's ""Kill Bill"" without the nod and wink that this is campy/funny. This movie is intense, violent, gory, gritty, harsh chilling and creepy. The only movie/scene that can compare the intensity to is ""Saving Private Ryan"", particularly the scene where Mellish is slowly stabbed by a German near the end of ""Ryan"". This movie can/will take your breath away.That being said, if you like this sort of thing, the movie is VERY well written, directed and acted. The casting was beautiful. Captain Spaulding, Otis, Lady Firefly are brilliant. Others were also great.I saw this at a private screening with a Q&A with Rob Zombie afterward. The audience experience was odd. Sometimes there would be cheers, only to have them choked off by the next few seconds. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat. There were moments of funniness, and well done comic bits, but this is NOT a comedy.During the Q&A, a gentleman (who said he liked 1000 corpses) described the movie as ""the worst, most violent depraved movie I have ever seen. It glorifies violence..."" This comment received some cheers. Rob replied VERY professionally (quote/paraphrase) "" I think you might have had the perfect response. ...if you want truly depraved, see Cannibal Holocaust or Man Bites Dog... this movies does not glorify the violence, it shows how ugly and nasty it is... I don't want people to cheer the bad guys..."" Bottom line? This movie makes you uncomfortable. It is absolutely, positively NOT FOR EVERYONE!!! It takes a long, hard, ugly look at the exploits of some truly horrible human beings and their affect on their surroundings. It was also done extremely well. If you like this genre, it gets a solid 9. However, due to its general limited appeal, I have to drop it to a 7 overall.",The Devil's Rejects
494,badlucksunshine,Top Secret Clown Business,10,12 May 2006,"I believe this is definitely in my top 5 favorite films of all time. He managed to humanize what were senseless, animalistic brutes in 1,000 Corpses, turning the ultimate villains into people that you actually begin to care about. Although it's realistic in it's brutality at times, it's also a twisted fantasy/ adventure that I have watched religiously since the DVD first came out, to relive over & over again. I can't help but relate many of it's similarities to The Empire Strikes Back. I know, an odd reference, but the scenarios of seeking harbor w/ a double sided character, on the run from a formidable enemy, pretty much all of it but the end, which was equally emotional in my book. I couldn't believe that they died after surviving Wydell's wrath, but that is the beauty of it, that you don't cheer their deaths, you actually mourn them. If that seems sick, i don't care, they did display human, very believable traits as the film progressed. I loved Otis in 1,000 Corpses, but Rejects really opened up his character through his interactions w/ his family & the way he let his guard down at Charlie's. But the biggest bonus was the brilliant soundtrack, which re-introduced me to Terry Reid, brilliantly placing his soft soothing music as a backdrop to the brutality unleashed on the Firefly trio. I want more.",The Devil's Rejects
495,bt198873,Ever see a sequel to a horror movie where ur rooting for the killers?,8,20 June 2006,"This is a sequel unlike any other i have seen. This takes the sick sadistic family from House of 1000 Corpses and puts the story on them running from police, not on the story of the people they are killing. While still extremely violent/disturbing to the point where u may turn ur head away or even feel a little nauseous, i don't see this as a horror movie and honestly could not place it in a genre if i tried. I feel it definitely should not be seen if House of 1000 Corpses isn't seen first because you won't have any connection to the characters. It'll still make u sick to ur stomache, but you probably won't like it. 1000 Corpses gave us an amazing 70's style horror movie with killers that are very amusing and at a point charismatic. The Devil's Rejects jumps on the charisma of these characters to the point where i laughed when one puts a man's face onto his girlfriend's as a mask while taunting her because HA! HE WOULD SO DO THAT!!! (sorry spoiler but u won't see it coming anyway).Then again I'm a sick person. Make sure u watch this movie if u think ur remotely as sick as me.",The Devil's Rejects
496,seano2,A vile piece of filth,1,5 July 2006,"To put it simply, this is a vile and disgusting film. However it achieves what one would believe to be it's goal of literally horrifying viewers, yet still remains to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. In terms of violence/action and acting, this movie is excellent. All the characters are played extremely well by their respective actors. Captain Spaulding in particular is a terrible character, who would give many many many children nightmares, and may just have given me a fear of clowns. Yet the way the character is portrayed is, in ways pleasing. The opening shootout sequence was particularly enthralling, possibly one of my favourite action sequences in a movie. The sequence was beautifully shot, with some excellent imagery, not to mention a fair bit of death.However, despite the movie having many positives (such as the aforementioned wonderful acting) the idea is sickening. The mind of director Rob Zombie is one of pure filth. It is hard to believe that anyone could be entertained by such a movie, only those with extremely sick minds could possibly love this movie. In my personal opinion, movies such as this should never see the light of day, and i love movies with lots of unnecessary death and destruction, yet the sickening feeling one gets from this movie is enough to never want to see it again. In summary, the movie has some wonderful acting, and a great opening sequence...yet this is spoiled by the idea and those with a normal frame of mind should just keep on walking if the ever see this movie in a video store.",The Devil's Rejects
497,whiterabbit_007,Missing Characteristics,8,7 July 2006,"I am a great fan of ""House of 1000 Corpses"", and ""The Devil's Rejects"" was a great movie. I loved the start and the truck load of swearing, Odis, Baby and Captain Spaulding, the awesome soundtrack and the continued sick torture that takes place. Although I loved all these aspects, i thought a few of the appealing aspects from ""House of 1000 Corpses"" were lost.For example, there was no ""grampa"", and no mention at all of ""Doctor Satan"". The movie was much slower paced than the first one and a lot of its original craziness was lost. Odis kept is brutal and angry characteristics, but didn't continue his long spiels about random things that don't make sense. Despite this he was acted superbly. Baby continued her childish yet dirty antics and Captain Spaulding continued his selfish and rough appeal. I was disappointed to see the original Mother Firefly was replaced and her teeth had been perfected. I did enjoy her performance though and she acted it well.Another bit that i found to be disappointing was their loss of weird and creepy behavior when they got drunk. In the first movie they get drunk and mutilate and torture people, not do drugs and have sex. As one of the quotes says, ""We like to get f**ked up and do f**ked up sh*t"". Although i was disappointed with aspects of this movie, it is still one of my favorites and I recommend it.The soundtrack is superb and timed perfectly, and the acting is perfect for the movie. ""Free Bird"" at the end made the movie for me. I think this movie was a great movie even though I was disappointed that some parts were left out. All the same, well done to Rob Zombie.",The Devil's Rejects
498,mutleyhyde,Feelgood movie of the year! **spoiler-free review**,8,20 July 2005,"This is the feelgood movie of the year - for ruthless outlaws, that is. It's gritty, grimy, ugly, relentless, and just plumb raw as hell.I think it needs to be said right up front that this is not a 'scary' film, as that was the one complaint my two friends who saw it with me had. No, this is rather a 'violence exploitation' film. It indulges greedily in exhibiting brutality for brutality's sake, not for some cheap thrills; there are no 'GOTCHA!' moments here - just a whole lot of blood, guts, and anarchistic abandon.The plot works well for me. The motivations and drives of both the crazed family and of the lawmen who pursue them are nicely played out, and it all comes together very well... with some possibly unexpected results.I think the casting was great, and the acting from everyone was natural and believable. Yes, some of it's a bit over the top, but we're not talking 'normal people' here. The protagonists here are twisted people, and mean twisted people at that, and the victims caught in their web find themselves in dire straits indeed, so it's wholly understandable that they might just be a little on edge (understatement). And yes, you read that right - the protagonists in this film are the bad guys. This is a story about outlaws, and is told very much from their point of view.The editing is terrific, the story clicking along at a good pace and coherently so. The visual style is just great, with old school exterior filming of desert highway culture and scenery. Interiors look great too, with attention to detail and natural lighting. But it's not all straightforward realism, as a few creative artistic moments serve to shake things up from time to time. It all worked very well together, and I really, really really liked the look of this film.And the scenes... they're just right on. I don't want to give anything away, but there is stuff here that is just brutal. But I guess that was the whole point.I also watched House of a 1000 Corpses for the first time just before Devil's Rejects, and Rejects wins hands down. Corpses was fun, but just didn't come together as well as Rejects. There is still humor in Rejects, but it's a much more serious film. I also feel that the acting and cinematography were better. It is clear to me that director Rob Zombie is maturing as a filmmaker.",The Devil's Rejects
499,McEricville,great movie if this is your type of thing,8,4 July 2007,"The Devil's Rejects should be taken for what it is...a pure bred, gory horror flick i did not see the first film 'house of 1000 corpses' so i was going into this one without knowing what to expect. The Devil's Rejects is about a 'family' of torturing serial killers and a town sheriff and his mission to take out the band of outlaws. the film is basically built to be a huge gorefest. and that's exactly what it is - and that's exactly what i was hoping for.the actors do a solid job of acting(although the blonde girl was horrible i thought) but the thing i really enjoyed about this film was the fact that it felt like we were in a separate world. despite the fact that we were set in the present in some country area possibly in georgia or Texas or something of that sort - it really felt like we were in some separate world. the feel of the film was great, the cinematography was nothing out standing, but i thought it was definitely interesting (the ending is a great example) and this is basically the should be model for movies of this genre the only reason i give it an 8 is because it really doesn't do anything outlandish or amazing that would make it a great horror film the way SE7VEN was or some movie like that...if your looking for gore and an interesting ride, check this movie out",The Devil's Rejects

Nobody can obviously be smart. Perhaps the film-writer wanted to do a movie that made him feel more sane and smart? This film is even worse than Alone in the Dark.Seeing this movie voted so high makes me believe one of two things. 1) The world is a dark and evil place and most of the inhabitants are perhaps better off dead. 2) Someone has cheated the voting system.If you are normal - don't watch this movie.

And what a tribute! In my opinion, it is the only film of the new millennium that really can reach the until-this-movie-unique pressing atmosphere of TCM. And it does so in much more gory way. I really loved it.Shaking cam and ""realistic"" soundtrack does not bring anything new to this genre but it was just done perfectly in this one.Oh and i liked how at the end sick-twisted-torturing family was set into their victims place by the ""deranged"" police. How they acted just like their victims when they were exposed to torture, humiliation etc. This was done already in Last House but it was done so much better in this one.Perfect slasher movie.

502,qholway,oh dear,1,6 November 2005,"sorry, this is not a good film. simply setting up a bunch of people for violent, miserable death and torture, zombie has no tale to tell and no point to make. as far as i remember nobody survives, not that it matters, which seems to be the point of this childish, inept exercise in ersatz nihilism. (actually, i may be wrong there... can't quite recall, but isn't there some hulking deformed fellow who comes to the director's wife's rescue and then... ohh, i really can't be bothered.) a lot of superannuated infants would have one believe that this film is 'sick' and 'depraved' to it's credit. it's not. while it is definitely deserving of both those adjectives it is still no good whatsoever.torture, humiliation, smashed-in heads and a clattering, numb-skull soundtrack might be your delight, i don't know, but i hope it isn't, for your sake. and naming these things as credits is just silly.it's a film that makes you feel bad, not for it's characters but for the world we live in and that we will be shortly leaving to our children. a world where watching supposed versions of ourselves being ripped apart, both literally and figuratively, is regarded as entertainment.horror has a place, sure, and good horror films are good films first. that they horrify means they've succeeded, but they have to have quality in the first place to do that. merely dealing out death and misery and pouring cancerous moral bleakness into our parietal lobes succeeds in nothing but fulfilling only the needs and curious desires of those blank-headed children mentioned earlier - the ones who slow down to see who got caved in in a multiple pile-up but who would, presumably, prefer not to suffer the indignity of being the crushed person being so voyeuristically studied.don't ask me what makes a good horror film, specifically - if i knew that i would be making one rather than typing this - but it's clear for (nearly) all to see what makes a bad one. this film could be a textbook for those looking to do just that.but do go see it if you like this kind of thing. it is, after all, aimed directly at you.",The Devil's Rejects

And as with any successful tribute to art-style he brings his own freshness and vision to it. Bill, Sid and Sheri have created one of the most memorable gangs of demented murderers in the history of cinema. William Forsythe has his best part in years as the anti-hero sheriff. If a creepy gore-fest is your thing... this picture has it all. Sex, drugs and rock&roll. Like Peckenpah he is not glamorizing the violence, it's disgusting and he lets us know that's what it is.

504,SteveSof,Zombie is Flexing His Talent,8,26 July 2005,"When I first saw House of 1000 Corpses, I was very disappointed. What was sold for all those months as a shocking, un-releasable, heart-attack inducing horror masterpiece turned out to be a deliriously over-the-top, anachronistic pseudo spoof of the schlocky horror films of the 70s that lacked any real lasting effect.The Devil's Rejects, however, is a totally different deal. The film is visceral, razor-edged, and tremendously intense. Rob Zombie has a very unique and effective ear for dialogue, and sets a very sharp camera. The film is very, very well shot.The film also features absolutely outstanding performances from some sorely underrated actors. The murderous trio are played wonderfully, but the show was defiantly stolen by William Foresythe. From the beginning of the film he is nothing but fire and brimstone and fearsome intensity, capturing the 'man consumed by revenge' archetype better than I've ever seen. Truly outstanding.Although at times I felt that the almost unceasing torture-violence made the film come off as something of a snuff movie, it is a powerfully gripping and chilling work of a new coming director with some serious talent.",The Devil's Rejects

But being such a hardcore horror movie fan, I journeyed to the theater tonight. Maybe it was that I went into with no/low expectations but damn was I moved.Loved the movie for its 70's panache, punchy cinematography, slick editing, and fun horror film acting- a big round of applause to Zombie's directing. Definitely some tense moments but I was happily engaged by the subtle 'war on terror' underpinnings. Surely it wasn't chance that the movie was staged in Texas where our current President descends- the state that honors its violent lust for justice. Hopefully Dubya will watch and learn something from this gross-fest- learn that our ego-maniacal, revenge-baiting, religious zealotry, cowboys-chase-down-the-Indians politics only creates further cycles of violence.

I think it was better than House Of A 1000 Corpses. I do want to warn people, that this movie is extremely violent. A lot of killings, and extremely gory. Spoilers: There are several cameos from stars of 70's movies: Ken Foree; Michael Berryman; Steve Railsback; P.J. Soles; and Mary Woronov. Also the actor who played Autoclyus's sidekick in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys make a brief appearance, wearing glasses and a mustache. In the beginning, they show shots of some of the victims at the old farmhouse, including some decapitated heads in a refrigerator. But that is not the most gruesome part in the movie. There are multiple murders in this movie, more than House Of A 1000 Corpses. In House, Tom Towles is murdered. In The Devil's Rejects, his brother hunts down Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding, because their mother killed his brother. Towards the end, Towles brother, played by William Forsythe, goes insane. He kills several people himself, before Tiny, towards the last 8 minutes of the movie, kills him. The Ending is a shocker. I recommend this movie to true horror and gore hounds.

It is a good film, not for a horror fan, but if you want to see actual acting in modern horror/thriller films, there is nothing predictable or conventional about the actors in this-each are different in a good way, but I think Bill Mosely stole the show as Otis B. Driftwood. Lesley Easterbrook also provided a fantastic scene as Mother Firefly. I never saw House of 1000 Corpses properly, just bits and pieces, and I understand why it got so many negative comments and reviews-if you're a fan of Rob Zombie's music, you will probably love it. You can tell just by the use of colours and sets in it-just watch his music video ""Dragula"" and you'll see what I mean. But just like everything, it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. The Devil's Rejects is a well written, well acted film with good uses of violence in film-it is used for the purpose and not just for the hell of it.

Very well done and entertaining, sometimes uncomfortable to watch, and made with awesomely decadent brutality. I was very impressed by what Zombie was able to do on a budget of just $7 million, and the strong performances he got out of the cast. The soundtrack, how he incorporated the songs, and the fact that he was able to secure the rights to so many 70's rock 'n roll hits on such a small budget are all phenomenal. The movie looks much different than his first effort, House of 1000 Corpses, and has a production quality that belies it's small budget. The movie surprises you with it's grimness and depravity yet engages you with it's style, sound, humor, and story. And the characters, for better or worse, are very memorable. But Ebert and Roeper gave it ""two thumbs up"" so it can't be all bad, right? ;-) The DVD set is very feature packed, so you certainly get your money's worth. Highly recommended.

But I have to say that Rob Zombie has no real talent as a director , very poor story line , awful dialogue , I even fell a sleep half way.This movie has no atmosphere what so ever , no suspense and is as predictable as Christmas time.I gave this movie a 4 , thanks to Sid Haig who as always ,did a great performance .Even Sheri Moon's ass flashing could not save her poor acting skills.Why make a movie we have seen a 1000 times before ZZZZZZ ZZZ ZZZZZZZZ Rob Zombie is truly un-original and should really stop ripping off other movies.",The Devil's Rejects

Lasts far too long for a story line that is weak and goes nowhere from start to finish. After 20 minutes seriously felt like I would switch it off but decided to give it a chance. It might just be a slow starter. Nope, I was wrong and ended up wasting 110 minutes of my life on worthless turd. Rob Zombie should stick to music, if this is the best he can come up with movie-wise. If you are expecting horror, you will be disappointed. It is not scary at all. Thriller? Disappointed, the action parts were clumsy and slow. Suspense? Nope, the plot is very, very predictable.

515,lexcorp17,Zombie makes a horror-buff's wet dream.,9,28 July 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is a perfect follow-up to his first flick House of 1000 Corpses. Considered a spin-off and not a sequel it is what every great follow-up film should be, and that is unique and different from the is predecessor. While ""House"" can be described as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre on LSD, ""Rejects"" is more like Tobe Hooper meets Sam Peckinpah, with a twist of Tarantino-esquire fresh flair. Instead of being filled with creepy little vignettes and montages like those in ""House"", ""Rejects"" takes itself more seriously and is chalk-full of creative editing like the freeze-framing during the car-jacking scene and the dramatic editing of the film's final scene (both in terms of the editing of the battle and the cross-cutting with the flashbacks). Moreover, Zombie skillfully plays with our emotions without making it obvious how he does so. Reminiscent of the great Hitchcock, Zombie is able to make you sympathize with the killer at times, rather than their victims. Personally, the scenes most difficult to watch were not those in which the Rejects torture and murder innocent men and women, but the scenes in which the Rejects are on the receiving end of the violence. This feat is aided in no small part by the performances in the film.Bill Moseley's Otis is a true killer, filled with rage and wrath and yet in complete control with his victims, he acts like a pro. Sid Haig once again does a fantastic job as Captain Spalding, stealing every scene he's in, his energy and ability to switch from laid-back to sadistic maniac in a heartbeat insures that his character will go down in history as one of the greats in the horror genre. Newcomer Leslie Easterbrook does a great job taking of the role of Mother Firefly, and is very impressive as she can still be threatening while sitting shackled to a chair. Finally William Forsythe's Sheriff Wydell starts off a little weak, but evolves as the film progresses, going from a man looking for justice to a blood-lusting psycho. Cudos to Zombie for his casting choices which are fundamental in creating the film's mood.Zombie uses a near-perfect mix of suspense, violence, and character development to keep the viewer interested. Having said that, I should point out that this is a film for horror geeks; it is NOT for the faint of heart. If your a fan franchises like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legends I garantee you'll hate this movie. This is no teen-slasher sex romp, its a real throwback to 70s sadism; so unless you have a love for the classics and a strong stomach, you might as well skip it because you'll either end up covering your eyes or scratching your head. Having said that MOVIE GEEKS UNITE! Finally we are given a REAL horror film to catch in the theatres. If you're anything like me you've been slowly driven insane by the crummy PG-13 remakes that have flooded the horror genre in recent years. Well look no further The Devil's Rejects is sure to satisfy your appetite for some memorable horror moments and a little good 'ole fashion killin'.",The Devil's Rejects

I look back with fondness at my viewing of ""House of 1000 Corpses"", that was a stinker as well but at least I was a little tipsy so the memory of it is a bit fuzzy. I had the misfortune to watch this when I was totally sober so every second of it is fresh and clear. One dimensional characters, a plot so thin it could be used for a solar sail, laughable editing (what are those transitions all about?) and the worst sound quality I've heard in a movie for many a year. Rob Zombie has good ideas and there's nothing wrong with tipping your hat to the classics, but the guy seems to have trouble translating this to the screen. More time needs to be spent on development and scripting, maybe Rob could stick to production and leave the directing to someone with greater skill in cinematography? I can't say anything about the sound quality, it's just beyond belief. Third time lucky, I can only hope.",The Devil's Rejects
517,sinecera,Not worth it,2,10 November 2005,"This film was one big torture fest with plenty of repeated scenes of a family of outlaws verbally and physically abusing their victims. Such scenes in this film lead nowhere and are ultimately useless to the overall plot. We get the point...they're bad people. Unlike ""House of 1,000 Corpses,"" this film tries to take itself too seriously, which makes it less believable and even more absurd. Take the opening scene: The police surround a house full of the outlaws and open fire on it. What happened to police protocol? Then, after a gunfight, the police decide to throw a tear gas bomb into the house. Later on, there are plenty of chances for the victims to act, but they do nothing. And when they finally do, the outlaws are too strong. They can take several blows to the head with a thick log and still act with the quickness of a sober man. The film also takes ideas from other films...remember the fire scene with Ford and Connery in ""Last Crusade?"" They went overboard with the slow-motion in order to fit all the songs into a scene. The outlaws do suffer for a short while...and eventually pay in a scene that took way too long. The movie didn't go anywhere. So, if you want a movie with absurdity and no resolution of any kind, see this. On a plus, the pictures moved wonderfully and they did a great job getting the sound in sync with the picture. And it was in color! Well...I like Rob Zombie's music...",The Devil's Rejects

It entertained me. BIG TIME! And in a way that didn't make me say ""oh come on, pick up the gun"" or ""run you moron"". I loved this movie! One of the few scary movies that have ever actually left me scared... or disturbed may be a better word. Awesome!

I say this because it felt like a cross between ""Thelma & Louise"", ""Tango & Cash"",""Natural Born Killers"" and ""I Spit on your Grave"", HO1000 felt totally different, I was actually scared for the characters, in this one I was ready for them to kill em' all! Spaulding was superb, but Otis was losing his edge and Baby wasn't nearly as horny as she was in the first movie(probably because she married The Director)Dr. Satan would of added a spark to the overall prod. value.

Think of ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""Devil's Rejects"" as one film (a la Kill Bill) and it makes sense. The point to this movie was to provide closure after the events that took place in the first film. That's it! The reason why it had a different style, was because the situation for the main characters changed dramatically and the music and scenery needed to reflect that. (note: Rob Zombie is also becoming a very skilled director, and the film reflects that.) Think of the first movie as ""cause"" and this film as ""effect"".

This is the laziest rip off of TCM I have ever seen. The concept seems to really glorify mass murder whilst placing its tongue firmly in cheek. Rob Zombie has attempted to give this a sense of humour but it fails miserably. The dialogue is appalling, the effects look cheap, the acting is poor. Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed of themselves and never work again. The ONLY plus point is the soundtrack which genuinely has some quality tunes but it doesn't carry a film. I can only think that if you like this film, you must either not watch many films and have no gauge of what a good film should be or you are as backward and inbred as the main characters in this pathetic excuse for a horror film.I advise anybody who enjoys cinema to stay far, far away from this movie.

Just like George A Romero's legendary Living Dead series, it captures the true horror genre's intent and objective... to scare the audience into submission. Rob Zombie conveys the Rejects in a state of constant flight from the fierce Sheriff Wydell (which, William Forsythe delivers the best performance of the movie, his character was by far the most enjoyable and his acting in the movie was far beyond excellent) and eventually both Wydell and the Rejects meet their demise, however, not without several brutal scenes and slight satire/humor that is found in the movie. Everything about this movie was far beyond what I had expected, it truly blew me away. Everything from the soundtrack, scenery, camera angles, lighting, actors, special effects and the eventual DVD packaging is nothing short of extraordinary. If people want to see what a REAL horror movie is like, this movie should be in the top 5 of considerations. It is that good, it proves you do not need a massive budget to make an unbelievable horror movie. The dual disc DVD is amazing, the second disc goes through each day of shooting and has lots of other bonus features. Well worth the money.

After seeing this movie I saw house of a thousand corpses and I have to say the Devils rejects in my opinion is such a better movie. Don't get me wrong house was good but it was a dark movie that really left you confused with the story at some parts in my opinion. The thing the really gets me mad though is that they did not bring back Dr. Satan for the follow up off house.

Rob Zombie made this movie so well the even though these people were evil it made me feel for them especially when they died in the end and i felt like crying. THe movie also has a good amount of Comic Relief that made me laugh for the longest time. And it definitely had enough action to satisfy anyones craving.

A brutal but also sympathetic story about what i consider a loyal family looking out for their own. What it lacks in brutality (compared to ""a thousand corpses"") it more than makes up for in storyline. Without going too far into detail (or spoilers), what we are looking at is an outcast family with a fondness for violence (& tutti frutti icecream) trying to make their way in ""common society"" while being chased by a ruthless & violent sheriff.

I was hoping for violent. Oh boy, was it violent. I was hoping for gory. Whoa nelly, that is pretty gory. I was hoping that the story would have a certain transcendent element to it, and thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.I'm going to watch it again, and I'm going to buy the DVD when it comes out.

535,onlyempathlonelyforetern,oddly funny and obviously gruesome,8,24 July 2005,"As i walked in to the theater to see this movie, I knew exactly what to expect. However, it turned out to be a more of the bad guys turn victims of good guys who you aren't really sure if they are really good guys. Confusing? Yup only thing that was sort of messed up. Sheriff Wydell who embarks on a vigilante killing spree of the infamous fireflies. However, not to successful at all. Killing only Mother Firefly, and torturing the other three. This movie, i felt, focused more on the religious beliefs of the fireflies, turning this movie basically in to a good against evil, God (Wydell) against Satan (Fireflies). The Devils Rejects is not as gory as its predecessor it sure does try to live up to its bigger brother. With scenes of pictures being stapled to bodies and a person being shot in the throat while still remaining alive long enough to be sliced and diced. Rob Zombie clearly is a very intelligent person, knowing just how to put enough comedy in with the blood and gore to keep the film holding you with its claws. Baby, Otis, and Captain Spalding being the main stars of this film really start to grow on you as the movie progresses and even until the gory shootout at the very end. I only usually root for the bad guy when i do not like the good guy but in this one i was constantly rooting for the fireflies to get away. Mostly when they seem to have no escape. Rob Zombie did a great thing by casting his wife as Baby, she is excellent through the whole movie. Her acting is always on its best and is terrifically terrifying. It is almost sad to see them die at the end of the movie but they die fighting.

I think I said ""Good Lord"" in disgust several times, and I've watched darn near everything out there. It's a movie that stays with you after it ends and makes you feel kinda ashamedly voyeuristic during. The feeling that you shouldn't be watching this, to me, marks a true horror gem. It isn't mindless violence either, (spoiler) Zombie wants no pity felt for the sadistic bad guys, because the bad guys get it in the end by a vigilante cop nearly as twisted as them.Thank Goodness for someone like Rob Zombie to make a true horror movie. Not a cookie cutter cliché driven one-liner spouting crappy two hours....you know, the kind you sit through feeling jipped because it ain't scary like you thought but has it's redeeming points. Even really good horror movies leave you improving on them after they're over, thinking this or that should've been done, or this or that would've made it better, but still have certain creepy memorable scenes. Devils Rejects sucks you in from beginning to end and is c-r-e-e-p-y, and would leave anyone hard-pressed to try to improve on it.It's near-perfect.

537,Ghost_Face_Killah,Masterpiece,10,31 July 2005,"Originally thought to be the sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects is actually a spin-off and should not be construed as a sequel. The only thing that's constant in Rejects as to House is the main cast of Bill Moseley, Sid Haig and Sheri Moon.In this violent spin-off, after a string of murders and having killed Sheriff Wydell in House the Firefly family (Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sheri Moon)) are hiding out. The police surround the Firefly place and after a huge opening shoot out send the family on the run. Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is captured while the rest of the gang heads off to Spaulding's brothers place. Ken Foree plays Charlie Altamont, Spaulding's brother, who runs the bordello in the town. A game of 'cat and mouse' becomes a game of 'mouse and cat' and vice versa once again.Rob Zombie's The Devil's Rejects is gritty, fierce and unpredictable leaving the audience in constant suspense. For a film with an ""R"" rating, it's quite brutal leaving little to the imagination- and to think that it's been cut down! Rejects felt like a mesh of various violent flicks from Texas Chainsaw Massacre to Bonnie and Clyde to Natural Born Killers, with a late 70's kick. The camera never shies away from the kill, the blood pours out of wounds and the acting only heightens the experience.Not to take anything away from the other actors but Bill Moseley and William Forsythe were remarkable. Sheriff John Wydell appeared to be Otis' direct reflection in the sense of rage, only their motivations differed. When Otis talked, I listened- and rarely laughed. He was BRUTAL. He molests women, stabs people in the craw and takes no mercy on anyone. The one time he attempts to have a little mercy the scene ends in bloodshed at its finest. Wydell started off a little as they say, meh, but once his character morphs from the victim to the hunter he became convincing and magnificent.The screenplay aided the characters a great deal in their delivery, especially scenes with Sid Haig. One of the craziest scenes in the movie is when Captain Spaulding steals a car from a woman and her kid is sitting in the passenger seat. The kid gets scared and Spaulding asks why he's afraid of clowns. He then says he's going to come back and that he better have a good answer or ""Ill kill your entire family!"" Funny or unsettling, you decide I also really dug Zombies plot changes where he flip-flops the pacing. The hunter becomes the hunted and vice versa. The movie carries a theme of the weak, the helpless and the powerful. Rob does us great service in inserting scenes such as one where we see the rejects having ice cream together and having fun- he makes us care for them. By the end of the film, you don't know who you're supposed to be rooting for- the good guys or the bad guys!? The score is magnificent- come on, who doesn't want to rock to some Free Bird in the climatic battle?! You don't like that song? Well then F-off!! Unlike House where Rob wrote original material, this time he picks out appropriate songs for the time and situations to give the movie more of its tone.Another big difference between House and Rejects is the cinematography and the entire look of the film. House is a fun, dark-colored adventure into the lives of the Fireflys while Rejects is a well lit, rough and stylistically blunt picture. It looked very reminiscent of a Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriquez film with the scenery and the cameras attitude- only it had the touch of Zombie. Rob has shown us that he can better himself and has prospered as a director instead of attempting to repeat what worked in the first film like so many other directors do.So what's going to happen with this movie? It's truly hard to judge because Rob made the movie what he would want to see, not specifically what we want to see.

Having watched it only a few days before going to see The Devils Rejects i was eager to see more Horror and thrills however i was very disappointed as the sequel took itself way too seriously and it didn't have a hook that grabbed you by your face and said ""watch this!!!"" like the first movie. It was interesting how the tables were turned in how you empathised with the killers as they were subject to the Sheriffs torture yet this was the only aspect of the film that stood out.

This movie will forever be captured and labeled in my head as one of the most remarkable horror stories ever told on the big screen. Its a mixture of 70's style horror and any serial killer documentary you've seen. It takes place what seems to be a few weeks if not a month or two after the events of ""House of 1000 Corpses""(which was a masterpiece,) which includes all of the original characters, only one character seems to have been casted differently. I don't know how to hype you people up to go see this movie, except by telling you that i've paid the ridiculous 8.50 to see this movie 10 times since it was released. And i was there opening day, you bet your @$$ i was. The ending was one of the best ever created in the history of film making, kinda wanted to cry myself.

540,mbaker3273,An instant cult classic,7,30 August 2005,"A lot of people did not enjoy House of 1000 Corpses. I was not one of them. I loved it. It took a few repeat viewings for me to totally appreciate it, but I came to love the Munsters from hell sensibilities. As a child of the 70's I grew up in the b movie horror heyday and stayed up many a night to catch the endless horrors from the disco era. So needless to say I was highly anticipating the release of The Devil's Reject's which I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed. I think the people that will miss the point of this movie are the same that criticized Oliver Stone for Natural Born Killers. We are seeing a horror movie from the eyes of the monsters. Monsters do bad things. I noticed that Mr. Zombie took the main criticism of the first movie to heart. Evil is indeed punished this time. I also enjoyed seeing the b-movie all stars cast. I'd wondered if a lot of them were still alive. Oh, and a special thanks to Mr. Zombie for resurrecting P.J. Soles.",The Devil's Rejects

542,basilboy-1,Is Otis B. Driftwood your hero?,1,8 November 2005,"I think this movie is sick. Was there a ""good guy"" in the movie before the last scene? I doubt it. Although to quasi-quote most of the people commenting on this film ""if you like murder, gore, sadism, torture, brains splattered on asphalt, and women wearing masks made from the faces of their dead husbands, then you'll love this movie."" So I guess the Fireflies are kind of ""good guys"". At least they're heroes. Well, that makes me think the people saying that really think what the heroes were doing in the movie was really cool. Just awesome. I mean, ain't it cool when some guy whacks another guy in the nuts with a big log and then crushes his skull before taunting a guy who's bleeding to death from a bullet-wound in his neck and torturing him? That's a lot of fun. Of course we would never do those things, no. Maybe people are just scared to sound too ""conservative"". Well, wouldn't it be better if people were scared to even let the thought enter their minds that killing is really cool, especially when it's sadistic. Wouldn't it be better if movies showed people what really happens in the lives of murderers like the Fireflies? That it isn't a game that ends heroically with the perpetrators true to each other until the very end (the film does a good job showing the love and dedication the murderers feel towards one another). Anyone who's read info about serial killers know they go through cycles--fantasy, murder, guilt and shame, fantasy, murder, guilt and shame...until it finally gets to them, and they are caught and have nothing to do but confess that they knew full well that what they were doing was wrong. A movie like this could be good if it showed all the horrific psychology behind serial murders. But this one doesn't. It attempts to make you ""feel for"" the murderers; the victims come across as rather stupid; the sheriff who tries to bring the ""heroes"" to justice fails miserably, and it seems the viewer should almost rejoice when he dies, because he's a sick weirdo. But wait a minute, that's what the ""heroes"" are. But the heroes are cooler, they know what their doing, and they're much better at humiliating people. They're pros. I mean, the sheriff is killing for revenge (how lame) but the fireflies are killing for fun (coool!). Otis taunts a decent man who's praying and says he should tell God to send down lightning. God doesn't, and Otis goes on to sarcastically repent. Truth be told, God would not force a man like Otis to repent. If I were the man whom Otis was taunting, I would say. ""Otis, you choose hell. God will not force you to do otherwise."" Otis rejected everything good and bright in the world for a life of hatred and running away. There is nothing good in him. Even those things which would appear good stem from selfishness. He ""loves"" his OWN family. And that's it. The amount of crap he does in the film cover that all up. He chose hell, he chose to do what he knew was wrong and evil. He knew right from wrong, human from animal. He chose the latter in both cases (along with the other members of his family). If you think that's cool, you have a really big problem.Lucio Argento said in his post that there is no rape scene in the movie so it's a fine movie. Whatever Lucio, what is it with so many people nowadays? A porn flick has much more redeeming value than this crap. And the movie says straight out that Captain Spaulding raped some kid cheerleader (although that's sort of okay, because it was a girl he raped, not a boy). So what, it doesn't show it in the movie! Come on there's no rape scene. Okay, then the movie is really good! But really, it's all irrelevant. I saw a French/Belgian movie called Du Kus (The Kiss). It had a rape scene in it. But the girl in the end got away from the man (a pimp) and got her life together. It was a really good movie that showed the horrors of prostitution. But Mr. Argento would disagree. It had a rape scene. The devil's rejects is a much better movie. It doesn't have a rape scene.Lady Saphria in her post called this film ""art looking into the deeper darker side of our human nature."" ""Our"" human nature? What the hell are you talking about? I'm sure a lot of people agree with you Ms. Saphria, most are in maximum security prisons.Don't watch this film. If you go to the theatre and feel compelled to leave don't be ashamed to get up and walk out. Ignore the scoffs of your friends and others in the theatre who think that knowingly, purposefully doing what's wrong is cool. But you do what you feel is right. Knowlingly, purposefully. The world will be a better place.",The Devil's Rejects
543,jeebusmcchrist,Dose exactly what movies should do - entertain.,9,20 June 2007,"Alright, I'll start out by saying I rather enjoyed ""House of 1000 Corpses"". It was a fun little movie to watch, but honestly, what it lacked was character development. It was basically a no-holds barred horror film, and any time spent giving the characters a back story was generally boring to watch and worthless to the story. ""Rejects"" gives you a bit of background to the characters, but this time it isn't exactly force-fed to you through a spoon.You see, both of these films are films that no one agrees on. Some people absolutely hate them, and some of us just love them to death. It seems to me that those who despise them are the same individuals that think cinema is the highest of the arts and all movies should be artistic masterpieces with gripping, romantic stories and a pseudo-intellectual plot filled with nonsense designed to cause intense orgasm of the most pretentious type.If you loved Titanic, this movie isn't for you. It doesn't try to be any more than it is, and it doesn't try to shove a bunch of half assed arbitrary moral dilemmas right in your face. The film has no good guy; the sheriff, the antagonist of the film, is hardly a good man, and you know from the beginning this family of lunatics isn't exactly the moral elite. Though the sheriff believes he is working for God and the serial killer's believe they are functioning as Satan himself, it's nothing more than personal justification for doing whatever they feel like - a feature present and accounted for in reality every single day. The movie lacks any convenient, obvious tips to tell the viewer who to agree with, and that's one of my favorite things about it.When you watch this movie, don't try to see some hidden meaning behind it. Don't scoff because it doesn't get your mind pumped up for some critical thinking; it's a movie, for Christ's sake, and movies were designed to entertain, not to please the pseudo-intellectual elite who still believe PETA is a worthwhile venture.",The Devil's Rejects

But during this movie, I had to keep looking over at him to make sure he was still awake he was so quiet. Rob Zombie's wife is beautiful and plays a killer all too well. I absolutely loved the ending. The cop finally got them and started torturing them, but then Tiny came and saved the day. Then they were trying to leave, and the cops had a road block set up. Free Bird came on, the three of them got there weapons and right when the song got faster, they pushed the peddle to the metal and started shooting at the cops.

545,grubber,Rob Zombie is the next Wes Craven,10,31 January 2006,"Besides great direction what helps this film succeed are the odd angles and the archival look which give the film an almost 3D look. The feeling of dread brought on by placing you deep into the characters lack of respect for life is almost too real.The scenery and surroundings are photographed with a claustrophobic eye to detail. It's this cinematography that really carries the movie through.The madness builds continuously right up to the final scene.The acting is surreal and so is the script and the ""stars"" of the flick are sincere in their efforts and it shows.Rob Zombie just may be the next Wes Craven or Alfred Hitchcock if he continuously pumps out creative and embellishing caliber movies as this one.I recommend it highly!",The Devil's Rejects
546,coryxyzabc,Big Fat Disappointment,2,25 November 2005,"I have always felt that music (guitar, drums, synth) in Rob Zombies songs sounds spectacular but the lyrics are cartoonish at best. His movies seem to follow the same formula. They look the part, but you just can't take this stuff seriously.As a director he does a descent job. Visually the movie is not too shabby and it has some realistic looking horrific scenes, which I would imagine, takes some level of skill to produce. But his skills as a writer are probably the worst I have seen in a long time. I feel that far too often when a writer can't come up with real dialogue, they just write in a bunch of argument scenes and throw in a bunch of moderately funny insults. I couldn't even make it through the first of these films because it was so ""made for TV"" feeling. But this sequel came highly recommended, and I decided I would give him another chance and watch the movie with open mind.Although this film is definitely better than the first it is still one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. Everything was so clichéd and obvious, and again, the dialogue was absolutely terrible. If fact the only really scary part about this movie is the dialogue, and I would rather be the guy who got his face cut off than be me having to ear more of that crappy dialogue! It is seriously that bad.I can only imagine that Rob Zombie sat down with someone and said, ""O.k., I am going to make this movie and this guy will get his head cut off, and then this other guy will get stabbed in the stomach and this other guy will be the one doing the stabbing. So there it is, let's start filming"" And then the person who he was pitching the idea to surely mentioned that a movie is supposed to have dialogue.And then rob zombie probably said ""oh...really? Well, how about this... we will just have the main characters say F**k this and F**k that over and over again and that should be good enough to get us from one killing scene to another."" At least that's the impression that you would get from watching this movie. But by no stretch of the imagination would someone actually perceive this as good dialogue.The characters completely lack depth and are for the most part unrealistic. The part of the character that seems vaguely realistic are the parts that are a total cliché and therefore just a rip off of some better movie. He doesn't give us enough to feel submerged in the story of to feel like we can relate to the characters. The only character that I felt had any depth at all was Sheriff Wydell, which is probably the most clichéd of all of the characters in the movie.So to sum all of this up, I think that Rob Zombie is marginally talented as a director but his dialogue writing ability is just as limited as his lyric writing ability. This is the prime example of why musicians should not make movies and movie stars should not make music. Sure, they can pull it off decently enough to sell records or movies, but it seems like a gimmicky way to get a few extra dollars out of their celebrity status, and not actual art. Artistic integrity gets tossed out the window for a few dollars. And as I mentioned Rob Zombie is o.k. as a director, but so are a ton of other people. In other words why do we need another mediocre director making mediocre films?",The Devil's Rejects

549,mediablitz-1,Pure Movie Making - Incredibly Well Directed,10,30 May 2006,"If Zombie can get just one more out like this in the next couple of years he may become the Tarantino of this decade. This is so far (movie craft wise) beyond John Carpenter, Wes Craven, et al, it's ridiculous. Before seeing TDJ I had to get some back story from House of 1000 Corpses (not recommended), which apparently was Zombies film school and he learned his lessons well. This psycho thriller jerks the viewer's morality back and forth until the line between hero and villain is so blurred you won't know who to root for. In the end, you could find yourself sympathizing with what may be the most reprehensible, miscreant serial killer trio in the history of film. You may have enjoyed Hannibal Lecter, but did you ever actually feel for him? What is even more surprising is Zombie's grip on the history and process of cinema. The DVD bonus is an almost 2 1/2 hour making of documentary (""30 Days in Hell"") that is very enjoyable. It makes it very clear that Zombie is a man of vision and knows what he wants and where he's going. It also reveals (if you pay attention) why this film works so well. The Devil's Rejects is indeed a ""depraved, sick and brutal film"", but it is the best one I have seen this year on the merit of pure out and out movie making. It's funny, I write all this and believe it or not I have never owned a Zombie album or been a fan (nor of any of that genre). All that is about to change.",The Devil's Rejects
550,zelazbert2,See it if you are not squeamish. Great movie.,8,9 April 2006,"I just watched this DVD on a home theater system with my wife. I had read the box, but was not prepared for what unfolded; I hadn't heard of it or seen the prequel. Less than five minutes into it, I could have sworn my wife would ask to watch something else because she normally doesn't like movies that freak her out. She didn't, and it did freak her out. She was willing to endure nightmares to see it.Devil's Rejects is gross, horrific, violent and disturbing and has a great cast, great makeup (hello Academy!), original editing/design, good pace, good music (not my taste), and a lot of memorable scenes. Most movies I've seen that attempt to do what this movie does seem to be made by people that are freaked out by their own subject matter, and end up being campy (horror) or are just badly made. Rejects is singular in my experience in having a good mix of realism, horror, style and production values.In the middle of the film, I thought of Natural Born Killers and how bored I would be watching it a second time. After finishing it, my wife compared it to Pulp Fiction, saying Rejects keeps you on edge the whole time, where Pulp gives you a lot more comic relief. I would agree, although there are some great comic moments in this movie. We also agreed that we could probably watch Pulp Fiction more times than Rejects just because of the comic relief.One thing that stands out as to why it is effective is this: I know that most of the elements in this movie are things that happen in reality, and I was almost forced to consider what it would feel like to be in that situation. I found myself backing away from the minds of the people in it, and that means I felt like I was in their minds, and THAT is creepy. My wife asked me a few times if it was based on a true story, and I had to reassure her repeatedly that it wasn't....Which makes it especially nice to watch on DVD, as they have a gag reel special feature. I doubt they played that during the credits at the theaters. It is nice to have some comic relief after this movie.If I were to fix anything about this movie, it would be the amount of punishment the human body can take. Many directors abuse this, and this movie does not scorn the topic completely, but it would have had just a bit more impact if it had stayed closer to reality. That said, see it if you don't get light headed at the sight of blood! Great movie, the best of its kind yet.",The Devil's Rejects

Think of it as the comic book/tabloid version of the Firefly family's crime spree. You know the kind of thing that roadside attractions like the one Spaulding runs would tell tourists.The Devil's Rejects is a continuation of the plot but it would be the Discovery Channel documentary film of the ""Real Firefly family"". Not the legend just the real individuals themselves and how mentally twisted they are.. not their cartoony stereotypes as presented in 1000 corpses.People compare Leslie Easterbrook's Momma to Karen Black's.. Karen played her as her legend would be.. Leslie WAS Momma in all her glory.. riveting performance as a great psychotic.Think 1000 corpses = Tales From the Crypt Comic..Rejects = Sam Peckinpah meets The Manson Family",The Devil's Rejects

This is no copy or rip-off of any existing film but he uses elements from both of these Directors to create a riveting horror film that had me grinding my teeth as it unfolded. Zombie makes wonderful use of a Classic '70s Rock soundtrack that is brilliantly woven into the fabric of this film, the last 20 minutes is great. I had seen 'House of 1000 Corpses' and thought it was alright, but this sequel has much stronger character development that holds through out the film. You also see elements of other Directors such as Arthur Penn 'Bonny and Clyde' and Sam Pekinpah 'The Wild Bunch'.

554,kurtz2000,I wanted to like it Rob... I really did.,4,25 July 2005,"Let me start of by saying that I went into this movie with a lower set of standards than usual. After the more than slight letdown of CORPSES, I wasn't expecting to be blown away by REJECTS, I was just looking to be entertained. Now mind you I've had a mini poster for this film hanging in my office for weeks, I've been talking about the film with friends, and we all pretty much agreed that based on the trailer it looked like Rob had finally gotten his chops down(basically, I really wanted to like this picture). Having said all this, about half way through finally watching the picture, I looked over at my wife and told her that I was considering walking out on the film, something I never do. I didn't walk out, and I'm glad that I stayed because there were some parts towards the end that I thought were pretty well executed, but overall my general attitude towards the film was that I pretty much was embarrassed for Rob.The violence delivered, some of the performances did as well, and there were certainly some stand out scenes, but nothing was going to save this mess from the poor writing. Without going into spoilers, the Groucho/Elvis scene was SO BAD that I cringed and wondered to myself how someone was capable of not only writing such crap but then seeing it through filming and final edit and still not having the sense to cut it. We got you Rob, you did your homework on the Marx Brothers, and I get you were probably mad that some didn't catch your homage in the first film, but there is no excuse to add a scene like the one you just did. A. It made no sense and B. It did nothing for the story. That's not the only scene like that in the film either. The chicken scene, the ice cream scene, I could go on. It seems to me Rob really respects Tarantino, and who doesn't? But, he's not even close to being on level with him, so the previously mentioned scenes come off instead sounding as a poor imitator trying to write dialog that he believes will be memorable and good enough to carry a scene without moving the story along, i.e. Royale with cheese.I could keep going but I will cut it short. Bottom line, this was film school on a big budget and I mean this as no insult on the part of TALENTED filmmakers in film school. Rob you should stick to directing short subject music videos. You have style no doubt, but leave the writing to the people that can do it well. There are plenty of talented indie directors that deserve the budget and crew you work with and it's a shame. I hate being this harsh because I really give Rob credit for beating the odds and getting these films made, and anyone who is trying to help push the horror genre along is worth a look in my book, but this film in my opinion deserves every negative word it gets.One last word on the cast. Bill Moseley was fantastic, even given some of the unlikely dialog for his character(Mark Twain s***?). Leslie Easterbrook was the best of the crop(Karen who?). And William Forsythe was as good as expected. As for Sheri Moon Zombie, I'm glad Rob is proud of his wife's ass, but it seems to be becoming a plot point. Sheri you look great, which might be good enough to get you on an album cover, but please take a few acting lessons before trying the big screen again. And finally Sid was great, but much better in the first one.4 out of 10 stars. Wait for the rental.",The Devil's Rejects

After it was over I realized that it was F***ing awful. The story is stupid. The characters are awful (especially that clown guy. I absolutely hated him). I think the reason this movie is called the Devil's Rejects is because it is so bad, that not even the devil would like it. It is down there with Super Mario Bros the Movie, and Son of the Mask as one of the worst movies I have ever seen Epic Fail.

The 3 main character's were a delight to watch and I absolutely loved Baby, she was bright and everything that came out of her mouth made me chuckle.

(It takes something very special to make that happen.)A lovely blend of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, Natural Born Killers, and Thelma And Louise, to name but a few.Rob Zombie has proved, yet again, that he has an amazing imagination, and also the ability to transpose that imagination to the big screen.

Zombie gets it done! (Note: I watched the unrated DVD, some scenes are downright gruesome.) I think this movie is as revolutionary as the first Friday the 13th or Halloween.

561,SannePlomp,What a ridiculous movie,4,24 June 2006,"I don't understand why this movie gets such a high score. Its a cliché ridden, piece of nonsense. It never gets exciting, the acting is very bad and the storyline is so predictable that in almost every case you know what will happen next. Its not the type of horror that seems to run the genre nowadays, I'll give it that. Lately you get a lot of movies with the moments where it gets creepy (supported by the music), the person looks around the corner and sees nothing (or it turn out to be a cat), so you think he/she is safe, and then it scares you. These very cheap scare moments don't do anything with the movie, its easy to create scary moments, its hard to create scary movies. This movies doesn't have any scary moments, you would probably call it a horror because of all the gore, and not even the gore is very explicit, and very suggestive. You don't get scared, even once. And tension build up? tension? what tension. But what bothered me most is the story is so ridiculous, that calling it a story is giving it too much credit. It is so predictable, and often very illogic (how's that for a weird combination). I often found myself shouting at the movie for the stupid actions people did.The only good thing about the movie is the camera work and the settings used. The camera is always shaking a bit, giving it a sort of amateur feel to it, which is interesting, it adds to the ambiance. The southern US, redneck country setting, abandoned factories in the desert, dusty farmhouse settings create a nice stage for an interesting movie, too bad the movie itself wasn't interesting. This movie is no horror. Its just a sad attempt to create something shocking. The nudity has no meaning whatsoever, but is just there to shock people, same with the blood and the violence, it does not add anything. If you want to see a horror movie, don't see this one, if you want to see.... well.... errr, crap? see this one.",The Devil's Rejects
562,leper_messiah_1988,Best movie released In recent years.,9,18 September 2006,"I was a fan of House of a thousand Corpses, but nowhere near to the effect I am of The Devil's Rejects. I feel like Rob Zombie has a promising career ahead of him in movies if he continues.It just seems like he is constantly getting better. Unlike most directors who get acclaim for their first movie and then have a flop for a second one. As soon as the story starts you KNOW you are no longer in the HOATC world anymore. Zombie shows his appreciation for westerns such as The Wild Bunch, by having a huge gunfight at the beginning. For anyone who has seen the HOATC you will automatically realize that the characters have changed over the four month period between the two incidences, and in a good way. In most crime/thriller type movies, you can tell that the director is just trying to mimic Quentin Tarantino's style, but not in Reject's. While the subject matter is similar to some parts of a few of Tarantino's movies, you see that Zombie definitely has his own personal style to his work. Like I said before, I see this movie more as a western, than a crime movie. These guy's are true outlaws. In every sense of the word. I don't know about other people, but I actually found myself wanting to BE Otis. The character is the epitome of cool. He's tough, mean, ready to fight, and will kill anyone who stands in his way. Then there's Baby, the eye-candy of the family. When you watch the movie though, you see that Sherri Moon-Zombie isn't only eye-candy. She can act. Any other actress, given the role, would have played it as the damsel in distress who needed Otis, and Spaulding to protect her. Not her though. She plays the character just as cool, and tough as Bill Moselly plays Otis. Then there's Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding. He was seen very few times in HOATC, and when we did get to see him, he had his clown makeup on. Now in Rejects we finally get to see him without the makeup playing a ""real"" person, instead of the comic book character type. Most of the jokes in the movie come from him. Which is very good, because I don't think A non-fan of gory movies would be able to watch it without the light and funny moments. Even though this movies isn't really all that violent. It's mostly all psychological violence.*Spoiler Alert* Now we get to my favorite part, the ending. I don't think there was any better way this movie could have ended. It is now by-far my all-time favorite movie ending. There is nothing cooler than seeing characters that you invested an hour and a half in and now feel like you know, go out in a high speed shootout with cops in their Cadillac convertible with FREEBIRD!!! playing. I mean, I don't know about anyone else but this is the way I wish I could die. They seem so bad when this happens. It has an effect on you, like you're actually proud of them.*Spoiler Alert Over* If you like movies like Pulp Fiction, Resorvior dogs, Bonnie and Clyde, Natural Born Killers, The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Kalifornia, etc........You will definitely love this movie. IT is in my opinion the absolute best film to come out in over Five years, maybe more. Rob Zombie knows movies.Interesting Fact: In the jail cell when Mother Firefly utters the famous line ""You got yourself into something you ain't never getting' out of"" Check the frames before this and notice she is wearing handcuffs. Then in this frame where she says that line she spreads her arms far apart,and you can clearly see she has no cuffs on. Then the very next second, her handcuffs are on again.",The Devil's Rejects

Not often do I get the feeling this movie gave me. Utter disgust. And in my world a movie that makes you feel is a great movie, no matter the nature of the feeling. And this was great. I loved the bad guy/good guy scenes and the madness that surfaced... And the music was so very fitting and gave the movie an extra nudge up my 20-best-movies-of-all-times ladder.I can only say that this movie is one of my all-time favorite ones.

Not only a Texas Chainsaw Massacre rip off, but a joke of a movie considering that the script was horrible, the filming was horrible, and the actors did not do much to stop the movie from making me want to end my life. I thought maybe, hey, Rob Zombie failed miserably with his first movie, but devils rejects actually looked cool. Well once again I was dead wrong. Not only was this movie not gory whatsoever like the previews made it out to be (if you want gore see ichi the killer) but it was also lame as hell. I mean REALLY LAME. That whole tutti frutti part just made me want to call Rob Zombie and tell him to quit making movies before the whole world commits suicide. So in the end, Devils rejects is a predictable, HORRIBLY written movie. Rob Zombie, your music is alright, BUT STOP MAKING MOVIES. If you want real horror and gore, see movies such as Audition and 3 Extremes. Don't bother with this film, it will only make you stupider.",The Devil's Rejects

Although occasionally creative in an original way the sum of the whole was, well, as suggested before a GREASY HAPPY MEAL DEAL THING that MAKES you feel like your enjoying it while its happening but annoyed and irritable afterwards.

But still, this is mindboggling, how there is no element of suspense whatsoever. Zombie is going for some kind of Texas Chainsaw Massacre vibe here, but this is what mcconaghey (or something similar) and zellweger did to that franchise, there is no understanding of the original and no feeling to be found. Where Hooper terrifyingly and beautifully portraited victim's agony, here you feel nothing but annoyance. To call this piece of crap frightening and disturbing is also far removed from the real world. Maybe, if your favorite horror movies include the recent remakes of the classics and your favorite horror film star is sarah michellle gellar, and of course that one dude who said that The Descent is only good, if you like chicks screaming in a dark cave, that could be the case. But if you have seen French horror of this century, brilliant Sprski Film, the real horror of Fulci, Argento, Romero and the ilk, you know what I'm talking about. This waste of film and everyone's time, thinks it's hard, tough and uncompromising, where in reality it's a total fake. Supposedly heavy, supposedly gritty, but if you can't inject any feeling in to your characters (in this film they are all so inexplicable useless, hollow and downright irritating),story and scenes, you're way, way off. Even if your characters are supposed to be vile, they need to be at least scary. And this very important thing is totally unknown to this movie. To everyone who can appreciate genuine horror cinema, avoid this. I just wanted it to end.",The Devil's Rejects

The more I think about it, the more i see how this story is very well thought trough.you'll fast come to think about natural born killers, the difference is that this one i actually good!Amazing actors who plays their rolls to the full.

If this is the only way you saw this film then you need to stop reviewing movies. The good old fashioned 70's slaughtering, in the hostile Alabama heat contrasts with the Joyful music. The cinematography is amazing, it places Zombie's work a head, shoulders and torso above the rest. Personally there was only one scene where Zombie took things too far, yet maybe he was just showing the ruthlessness of the family. Lastly, ""clice"" horrors have bad acting, and the make up is fake, however this film does not fall into that area.

Rob Zombie made me feel dirty for my lack of compassion. My eager anticipation of the next awful moment. And that, as Otis says so perfectly is ""the devil's work.""This film feels like it's pleading a case against God. The film asks (during one of the films numerous acts of violence) why God does not come down from Heaven and stop these blatant evils. The argument seems to be 'how can God exist when the world is so wicked?' For what it's worth: this movie makes a good case. Not so much for the disillusion of God, but for our inner animal natures. Much like in 'Natural Born Killers' and 'Resevoir Dogs,' by the end of the film we appreciate these murderers on a rock star level. We want to see them survive. We want a sequel.The directing is rich and impressive. Rob Zombie proves himself as a promising director with startling brutality, memorable characters and a killer southern rock soundtrack. The ego the drove 'House of a 1,000 Corpses' is all but gone. This movie is wonderful and terrible on a base level.

It had great cinematography (it almost felt like it was actually from the 1970's), great music (especially the sequence with ""Free Bird""), great direction (better than 1000 Corpses), great writing and great acting (especially Ken Foree).

580,larsbergbom,A mediocre film by a mediocre filmmaker,2,9 November 2005,"The devils reject, oh no, not again. I've read a few comments about this movie and it amazes me how much good response this movie has received. Rob Zombie's Devils reject is not as bad as the first film he did but oh boy does it stink. Rob Zombie has indeed proved himself to be a mediocre film maker, I feel rather sorry for him trying so hard to join the masters club of Tobe Hooper, John Landis, Wes Craven, Mario Bava, Ruggero Deodato, George Romero etc. What separates Rob Zombies from the above mentioned filmmaker is that they HAD SOMETHING TO SAY, may it be social commentary etc. But Mr. Zombie don't have much to say and that is one of the reasons why his movie falls flat, along with bad dialog and super bad acting from his wife. There is no reason for me to even talk about what happens in this movie but if you wish to see some movies that actually are interesting, intelligent and utterly gory or disturbing, you should watch Irreversible, Man Bites Dog, Funny Games, Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust, Visitor Q. These are film made by good filmmakers. Quentin Tarantino steals from many movies, but he puts his own unique touch to it because he is indeed a good filmmaker. Rob Zombie steals from left to right (and I do think we all know which movies he stole from) but he has nothing unique to add to it which just makes it bad in comparison to the originals. I can imagine that this movie is appealing to youngster that are just scratching the surface of alternative cinema and especially the more disturbing horror and drama movies that are out there. But when they get their hands on movies of this nature with deeper meaning they will find The Devils Rejects rather uninteresting. One of my fellow film students once told me that whenever you make a movie, you should hope that it will be received as a VERY good movie or a Extremely BAD movie, BUT NEVER EVER A BORING MOVIE cause the boring ones will just pass by unnoticed, and that is what Devils Rejects is, a bad and boring movie and I can bet 10000 bucks that five years from now it will hardly ever be mentioned.thanks and goodbye",The Devil's Rejects

Anyways, Rejects is one hell of an entertaining film. If you love horror movies, or hell, even if you don't, you should enjoy this movie. It was exciting, funny, and most of all, suspenseful. It really toys with your emotions because on one hand you are rooting for the Firefly clan, and on the other you feel awful for what they are putting their victims through.The cinematography in this movie is interesting, to say the least. Most of the shots were done hand-held, so they feel very amateur-ish, almost as if we are watching some sick person's old 8mm home movies. The grain of the film also adds to this effect, ultimately delivering the sense that these events really did occur way back in 1978.All in all its a decent flick, definitely worth going to see at the theater, and definitely worth picking up on DVD when it comes out.8/10",The Devil's Rejects

Rejects is basically a tribute to the 70's horror genre, which in my book is a great model for modern horror. This movie brought me back to the old horror classics, such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Rob Zombie gave us the most gruesome scenes in this sequel to the very popular ""House of a 1000 Corpses"". Once again, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, and Sheri Moon Zombie score big with fabulous performances.""The Devil's Rejects"" is about the Firefly family, who are a bunch of Serial Killer's which live in the deep south. One day the cops track enough evidence to put them in jail for life. Somehow Baby, Otis, and Captain Spaulding escape, and go on a killing spree throughout the southern parts of the United States. This movie lets you to get to know the character's on such an intimate level. This movie is like taking a step into hell.I really loved this movie. Watching this movie was really hard, but it was all worth the hour and fifty minutes. This story is a very powerful one indeed, and the performances just knock me away. And the music in this film is unbelievable. The special effects are great, and there are so many special appearances by actors from 20 years ago. I am not going to tell who they are. This is a very violent, so those of you guys that feel hesitant about violence, I don't suggest you see this movie. You'll just have to watch it for yourself.",The Devil's Rejects
590,chnawroc,A Timeless Horror Classic,10,10 August 2005,"If we all have re cooperated from the shock and macabre of the last Zombie film(and i emphasize film)then go see Devils Rejects.The plot is immaculate and intense. The character development can be compared to Gone With the Wind, and other classics such as Citizen Kane. In this film we see the family as more compassionate towards each other, which is exemplified more in the end. There is also less emphasis on the supernatural i.e.(DOCTOR Satan)which beautifully orchestrates the family as just that,a family,and not just sadistic murderers. The ""mis en scene"" (which is french for in the frame)is harmonized beautifully with the music and cinematography swimming gracefully in a sea of symbiosis.

591,mulhollanddriver,"Very real, gory and great",9,26 July 2005,"First off, let me tell you that this is not your regular everyday horror movie. This will not scare you the conventional way, it will get inside your mind and make you wonder if you are hoping the killers get killed or if they escape. This film is a huge improvement on Zombie's first film ""House of 1000 Corpses"", which I liked, but seemed a little too ""out there"" and had a little bit too much of a good thing going for it. This movie, however, is on par with Man Bites Dog and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in its goryness and realness and is one of the few movies that doesn't spare the audience of any gory detail. Let me tell you, if you want a ""good time"" at the movies or something like ""House of 1000 Corpses"" look somewhere else because this except for some very dark dark humor will not make you laugh and at times will make you want to look away but don't or else you might just miss Rob Zombie grow up as a director right before your eyes.",The Devil's Rejects

Not for everyone, (about 90% of the theater I was in had no clue what they were getting themselves into and ended up hating it, some even walked out on it) but if you liked the first one you will definitely love this one. Great performances from all cast members and great cinematography. Very sadistic violence and lots of gore and foul language but there were quite a few scenes that were really funny. Fun to see some of the characters were from old horror movies like Texas Chain Saw Masacre 3 (Charlie). All in all good film, should have a really good soundtrack as well.",The Devil's Rejects

Totally explicit, unnecessary and over the top brutality mixed in with scenes that make you feel for and want to root for a bad guy (on both sides of the story because there really is no good guy).

This movie should not have been made, and my heart weeps for those who saw this and enjoyed it. I have never before seen a movie that I thought was so inappropriate and so poorly made as this steaming pile of...There certainly was shock value to it, but it was just wretched. The characters were deplorable low-lives; and yes, that was certainly appropriate, but how do you even justify portraying these people on the big screen. Maybe I missed something. Maybe I was so offended by the sheer lack of quality and the grotesque subject matter that I forgot to keep my mind open to there being some cinematic value - but, maybe not.This is the first movie that I can honestly recommend to nobody outside of the penal system.

595,the-sacred-oaks,Devil's Rejects is the Worst Movie in the History of Cinema,1,2 September 2012,"I have never purposefully set out to give a film negative feedback before, and hopefully I will never do so again, but this film ""The Devil's Rejects"" is truly the most terrible film, in my opinion, to have EVER been made.I am not criticizing the acting, directing, editing or other technical feature of the film. What makes this the worst movie in history is that is celebrates and revels in horrible evil and treats the most heinous acts of needless torture, murder and depravity as something glorious and beautiful. These characters in the film represent the most truly evil persons that could possibly be imagined and the film lifts them up and treats them as if they are amazing and that the atrocities that the characters of this film do to their innocent victims are treated like it is something glorious. The film treats these Ed Gein-like characters like they are fantastic rock-stars to be admired or praised.You might say to me ""Damn, it's just a movie"", but when movies like this are acceptable or even liked it is just abominable. I am not religious in the least, yet watching this movie made me feel sick inside. To WANT to make a movie like this, come up with the idea, and then spend millions of dollars to make a movie about the celebration of evil (trying to make evil good and good evil) is beyond comprehension. Rob Zombie is truly mentally ill, sadistic, and evil for creating such a monstrosity and trying to present it to humanity.",The Devil's Rejects

To anyone with a double-digit IQ, 1 star is about 1000 times more than it deserves.This film was dreadful - pointless gore (to the point of mind-numbing boredom), no plot to speak of, dialogue and characterisations straight out of a 10-year old's essay on the Manson family, and it was about as scary as the Simpsons Halloween specials. I assume at different times Zombie was trying to be funny, scary, meaningful - zero on every level.Seems that the only 'point' of this movie was to create porn for wannabee serial killers.

My brother forced me to watch the first one in order to appreciate this one -- which was a wise suggestion.With ""The Devil's Rejects"", Zombie blew me away. ""House"" was what I would have expected from a musician turned director. This is what I would have expected from a highly attuned admirer of horror/cult films.It's shocking but entertaining. Certain scenes are disturbing, but stop short of indulgence. It's structured with the precision that even some of the best Hollywood movies fail to accomplish.""The Devil's Rejects"" is well worth watching if you know what you're seeing.

599,cfontana,wow! what a piece of garbage.,1,19 December 2005,"This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I didn't even watch the whole thing, just the last 20 minutes. I don't think it matters that I missed the majority of the story, what would I have gained from it? I'm very sorry that movies like this are made and I feel sorry for audiences who applaud this kind of stuff. Films that present no moral purpose, devoid of any meaning make audiences stupid. I've seen it first hand. People who buy this kind of garbage are really stupid and unable to make rational decisions. I feel that much dumber for wasting 20 minutes of my life on this trashy and irritating film. I feel absolutely wretched. The Devils Rejects! oooo, so bad ass! Is this film trying to say something? because the only thing I barely got out of it was that human beings are an ugly and brutal species, capable committing atrocious acts of violence. Well thanks Mr. Zombie, just what the world needs to see. Sure, I bet the film makes an wondrous intellectual statement about human nature, that's why so many critics embraced this work of genius upon its release. Right?This film displays merely sensational violence, projecting the idea of violence as an art form, with its despicable hyper-realist perspective, i.e. slow motion cinematography and mind blowing helicopter shots to emphasizing NOTHING. Many films do this, but this particular film takes the audience deep into a void of crap; gritty, side of the highway Texas where everyone is a fat hick with no dental coverage. Much like that garbage remake of Texas Chainsaw Masacrap, this film sucks more than anything ever. I don't care if people think I am a pretentious film snob. At least I'm not a desensitized film whore, subjecting myself to this onslaught of crap. I rarely say this, but if you liked this movie, you are inevitably a tool and I never want to meet you.",The Devil's Rejects
600,johanvunge,Rob Zombie.. you did your best at least,2,30 September 2005,"First of all i wanna say that my rating of this movie has nothing to do with my taste of music. I like music with a little bit of edge (enough said), but Rob zombie should kick himself three times for making this movie.I mean he tries very hard to make this a movie a legendary cult movie like ""The Natural Born Killers"" but fails miserable. Anyone who has seen this movie can agree with me.. There is no plot, The characters are weak, the acting is weak, the filming is actually so, so. Overall the movie sucks. Making money on the fact that he is a rockstar seems to be the main objective with this movie.. Its sad because i actually had high hopes for this movie, but it lacks finesse and originality.He makes this movie from of a 14-yearolds perspective (lets throw in a lot of blood and gore and skip the rest, i wanna make some more money before i die.) My suggestion for anyone who is thinking on seeing this movie is to forget the whole thing and rent, go and see, something else in the same category of movies because I cant see how it can get worse than this.My rating is 2, and thats because hes not using his own personal digital camera while making this lame movie.",The Devil's Rejects

Or that my money went to the box office returns for this movie and may make it look like it is actually successful. If you truly feel the need to see this movie wait for it to get to a dollar theater that way it doesn't hurt so bad. This movie had no apparent story line, the ending (if you can call it that) was predictable and lame.

I know it was just a movie, but after watching House of 1000 Corpses and then Devil's Rejects, I just fell in love with the characters. Rob Zombie did a wonderful job on humanizing the characters in Rejects. You see more sides to them than you did in House of 1000 Corpses. Leslie Easterbrook did a wonderful job playing Mother Firefly. Of course Bill Moseley, Sheri Zombie, and Sid Haig were wonderful as always. In the end you felt for the trio. Even though they were evil people. A lot of gore, violence, and horror. Very vivid. Made it very exciting to watch.

In fact even Al Qaeda terrorists would be preferable as guests for tea as at least they have a cause all be it misguided.

605,Sick_among_pure,Finally a solid horror film,9,28 July 2005,"The Devil's Rejects is one damn fine film by Rob Zombie. The film's tone is sharp, it plays with its horror realistically as a film could be, not campy as in most other films in this genre tend to do. 1)First off the look of the film is great, a cross between a home video and something out of a spaghetti western. Very gritty and shocking. 2) The score/ soundtrack, stays in the time frame of the movie. The 70's sounds help to make the film more believable as if this is some sick and twisted tale that actually took place. This film is also that rare case where the sequel surpasses the original film, While House of 1000 corpses had its moments and looked good, here Rob brings everything together to have a solid film all the way through. I cannot wait to see what comes out next from the mind of Rob Zombie.",The Devil's Rejects
606,mark_a_p,The kind of movie that puts some dirt on your jeans when you came in wearing khakis.,9,4 August 2005,"First off, I was not a huge fan of Rob Zombie's first offering, but still found it over the top and enjoyable. Seeing a more 'realistic' sequel waiting, I was excited.So after seeing it today, I found it to be one of the most well rounded (for its type) movies. First off, the soundtrack was woven into the movie to in such a way that few can do. The songs are usually background for the action, but here both are on equal ground. And one might thing that Mr. Zombie might be a bit one sided in his offerings for the score, no, its got gritty drug-induced country to old school pop/jazz.So I think the biggest compliment to this movie is that I really fell for the main trio of characters. Sure they might be necrophiliacs and murders, but through the movie's dialog and ironic situations you see some humanity underneath their blood soaked skin.My only problem with the film would come from the polarization of morality. It was all good vs. evil. God vs. the Devil. But thats only a small part of the movie.Really, what made it for me was the humor. Rob Zombie really knows how to pull the strings of an audience. We all were expecting a gritty blood soaked monster of a movie, and overall thats what we got, but there were times when the dialog was too much. Case in point: can you read this line and not chuckle? ""I'm gonna have to be taking your car today. See I have some top secret clown business that supersedes any plans that you might have for this here vehicle.""",The Devil's Rejects

He keeps you on your seat until the end and can keep you guessing till the final moments.The other bonus in this movie is the acting done by Bill Mosely, Sherri Moon Zombie and Sid Haig. They stay true to their characters while adding a new sense of panic to the story.Overall this movie is a must see for horror or HOTC fans.

Every minute of the film my eyes were planted on the screen and my heart was racing. There always seemed to be an unsettling nerve in Zombie's The Devil's Rejects. From when the kick ass shoot out scene began all the way until the touching ending that will leave you speechless.Each character seems to be different then from House Of 1000 Corpses. Where as characters like Captin Spaulding are more catoony and funny in House, they are more serious and real in Rejects. Diamond Dalles Page and Danny Trejo are a sensation on screen together.The songs that Zombie chose for this movie are very fitting for most scenes. The soundtrack is most awesome.

Seems to leave room for yet another sequel, as we don't know what finally happened with Tiny. Interesting soundtrack to this one too. I don't think any of RZ's own music was featured at all, mostly seventies rock.The mom is totally frenzied in this one, more so than in the first movie. She and Captain Spaulding both play a larger role than in HOATC, and you'll find that Spaulding is a little more involved than you might have thought from the first movie. Overall I was very impressed, its not too often that a sequel outdoes the original movie, but in my not so humble opinion, that is exactly what has happened here. Enjoy! Kristy",The Devil's Rejects
611,stalin828,Must see movie of the year so far!,8,30 July 2005,"Many people were turned off of House of 1000 Corpses due to the brutality of the movie. I was one of those people. After about half of the movie I turned it off because, personally, I am not interested in watching a bunch of people brutally murdered without there being something to keep me interested.However, The Devil's Rejects does not suffer from the faults of its predecessor. The gore in The Devil's Rejects was not overdone and it did not take away from the overall quality of the film.At the very start of the movie you are thrown right into the action. From there the movie takes off and you are shown the exploits of the disturbed Firefly family as they tour the countryside scaring and murdering several people. Zombie does an amazing job of vilifying and humanizing Otis (Bill Moseley), Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie), and Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig). By the end of the movie I found myself hating them for being sadistic murderers, yet identifying and sympathizing with them.As far as acting goes, Sid Haig does an excellent job as Captain Spaulding. Of the Firefly clan, Bill Moseley (Otis) really steals the show. He gives off a Manson vibe that is very chilling, yet, at the same time he can be quite funny. Sheri Moon Zombie proves that she is an adept actress. However, William Forsythe really sets the bar as the Sheriff seeking revenge.The soundtrack of the movie is also excellent. The movie takes place in the 70s so you can expect to hear several great songs from that era. If you are not a fan of Rob Zombie's music, do not expect to have your ears assaulted with his brand of metal.Overall, Rob Zombie shows that he is an able director with his latest movie. In my opinion this is the must see movie of the year so far. However, if you are easily disturbed by brutality and violence this movie is not for you. This movie is rated R and it is very deserving of the rating. As such, children should not be allowed to see this movie unless you are sure they will be able to handle relatively detailed depictions of murder and torture and quite a bit of nudity.",The Devil's Rejects

I had seen House of a 1000 Corpses a few years back but didn't really get into it. The Devil's Rejects is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is a sick and gratuitous following of what Zombie considers entertaining. Everything is glorified,from rape, to murder,to sodomy,to necrophilia. I read the other review of this before i went to see the movie, the one applauding Zombie for making something beautiful, whoever wrote it has sh*t for brains.

There was torture pain and revenge, Rob Zombie's film making, horror film making should be studied in film schools across the globe. I was only disappointed in one aspect of the film, a sore thumb if you will, the twist...I believe that this movie didn't need a twist...it was twisted enough...but you should judge for yourself with that said the rejects in this movie are reruns from the last, obviously, with Captain Spaulding, Otis Driftwood, and the always beautifully disturbing Baby Firefly. The most scaring of the film was the obscene insanity that seem to seep from the pores of the main charters... This movie was dingy, dusty, filthy, foul, grimy, grubby, grungy, mucky, muddy, nasty, smutty, soiled, sordid, stained, and uncleanly...brilliant !

This script is like listening to a constant stream of wise-cracks which don't work. 3)Its a total re-hash of many other movies which were of a different class to this turgid waste of time (Texas Chainsaw Massacre!!).On the plus side, the music is great.

I can't wait to see it again actually. Nudity, guns, blood, and guts are the order of the day, and that's all right by me. The guy who played the police man was great.

Instead the body count was toned down, but what was shown was at an extremely gruesome level. Rob Zombie decided not to go into the supernatural this time, which was a good move because it made the movie more realistic. He also decided to put a lot of sexual content/nudity in this one. Another good touch of realism.This movie starts with the police raiding the Firefly house, and a big shootout. Otis and Baby get away and team up with Captain Spaulding. The rest of the movie is for you to find out. You get to see many sick things such as Otis forcing a woman to undress and then pointing a gun in her panties, a man being beat to death with a board and a girl getting a knife thrown into her chest.Don't get me wrong, this movie could have been better.

Don't get me wrong, I love gory, sleazy grind house cinema. But this movie failed on almost every level. I wasn't shocked. I wasn't disgusted. I was just bored. Incredibly bored. Here's why: (Spoilers ahead) 1. Pacing. I fast forwarded through the entire hotel room torture scenes because it was taking so damn long. What started off as being a tense and terrifying hostage taking scene dissolves into the two killers standing around insulting their captives and forcing them to strip. Oh please.2. Realism. I know its a horror movie, but still. The scene where Otis overpowers two grown men after being hit in the back of the head by a wooden board had me laughing. And when you're about to storm a house owned by a mass murdering family, don't just bring along you're redneck deputies. Call the damn FBI.3. Characters. Forget about it. I know Zombie was trying to get us to like the two main ""characters"", Otis and Baby , in a Hannibal Lecter kind of way, maybe route for them. But I hated them, Otis in particular (Sherry Moon's acting is so uneven I really didn't care about her character). They lacked any real menace or charisma. And most of the other characters were completely unlikeable. You know a movie's in trouble when the only victim you feel sorry for is the Mexican maid! 4. Story. The movies starts off with the Firefly family being psycho mass murderers. Then after they kill off five people, all of a sudden its party time! They're off for some booze and whores at their buddy Charlie's whorehouse (Ken Foree was great in this movie, BTW). I don't know how Rob Zombie thought he could pull off turning serial killers into victims halfway through the movie. Are we supposed to feel bad when they're captured? Hell, I was cheering through the entire torture scene.5. The ending was the biggest letdown. The film was almost redeemed when the Sheriff finally gets his hands on the three killers and gets his revenge. But then what appears to be a handicapped Freddy Krueger comes out of nowhere and kills off the sheriff, and everything goes down hill from there. I think Mr.Zombie should be sued for ripping off the ending of Thelma & Louise (and for making us listen to ""Freebird"". Ugh.) There were some things that saved it from a single star. I didn't really buy Captain Spaulding as a serial killer, but he is one hilariously sleazy and vile character. Sid Haig stole almost every scene he was in. The only character I was routing for was Sheriff Wydell (an excellent William Forsythe). I know he's a redneck and a religious nut, but he's probably the only likable character in this entire movie, and the only scary one too. I loved the scene where he kills Mother Firefly.Honestly, I don't why people love this film (even Roger Ebert liked it!). I wish Rob Zombie would stop paying 'hommage' (i.e. ripping off) 70's gore flicks. I do see a great horror movie director in the making. He just has to stop making nihilistic and self-indulgent movies. So pass on this movie and hope he'll do better on his next one. Until then, rent ""Hight Tension"" instead.",The Devil's Rejects

623,jonathan-ferris,Truly awful to the point of frenzy,1,10 August 2005,"Sometimes you see a film so unredeemable, so terrible that you cannot believe that funding was made available to make it. this is one of those. Sometimes you watch a film so disgusting and so genuinely without any possible justification that you actually wish it could be censored to save anyone with an ounce of moral sense from accidentally seeing it and deciding to shoot smack rather than conceive of a world that produces such things. This is one of them.This film is just plain bad. For a so-called horror film ,it has nothing that would connect it with any films worth mentioning (except Peter Foree). The level of sadistic violence does not bother me much, moreover the lack of any context or characterisation. When a film glories in violence and works (Irreversible, Clockwork Orange) it is because this violence has a wider thematic purpose. here it is just masturbatory fodder for pathetic teenagers, which appears to be the demographic this film is aiming at, when you consider the horrendous dialogue. If you find this film anything other than an affront to everything that matters in this world, you are an idiot.see something else, 'The Descent' for instance.What kind of name is Rob Zombie anyway?

I was DEEPLY disappointed. Not only is the storyline boring, but the acting (with the exception of maybe one or two characters) was awful. I couldn't even sit through this entire movie, which makes this one of maybe TWO movies that I've literally hated. I can't express how horrible I thought this was. The directing was done fairly well. I think that Zombie certainly got his point across. The disturbing, makes-you-want-to-take-a-shower feel of House of 1,000 Corpses remains strong. However, this movie just didn't cut it. If Zombie made a new film, I'd see it... I still have hope. If you haven't seen this movie, I'm sure my telling you how bad it is won't keep you from renting it.

Yes, you can compare it to many 60's and 70's flicks that came before, but he pulls it off in such a way that makes it seem fresh again. I know what goes into an apple pie. I know sometimes there may be a bad piece of apple or two, but that doesn't stop me from eating apple pies. I love apple pie! And this is the best gosh darn apple pie I've eaten in a while! Those who love this flavor (and you know who you are) will see this movie again and again. Those who don't (and you know who you are), STAY HOME!!!).About the music in the film; it mirrors the movie. Have you heard the songs before? Yes, a million times in some cases. Have you heard them put to film in this context and see it work? No, you haven't. In the past, my stomach would churn when I heard ""Freebird"". This time it brought tears to my eyes. I will never be able to hear that song without thinking of this movie.

Bill Moseley's performance as Otis Driftwood was again riveting. He makes one hell of a scary guy! Sheri Moon as the demented ""Baby"" just gives me chills. Someone so beautiful could never be so horrific, could they? And to me, Sid Haig as Captain Spaulding just makes the movie. Those teeth! Ack!

Once you grasp that fact (nothing original here), you can actually enjoy this movie. I admire Rob Zombie for doing what he's passionate about, BUT, to remake TWO!!! (the only 2 IMO) HALLOWEEN movies is cocky and almost blasphemy. I am entertained by anything entertaining. It's like cover songs. They might be good, but I'd rather hear an original.Tribute albums, live albums, cover songs, and most importantly, remakes of horror movies, really grind a fine line with me. I feel if I was a FAN of any media, I would try to go above and beyond with original content, but, the more I think....all of the good songs are written, all of the good movies were made, ....that's a bad attitude to have, i think Rob Zombie remaking the Halloween movies was cool from a FAN standpoint, but sacrilege from a true horror movie fan.

This movie is extremely violent and i found it entertaining, in between violence is some pretty damn funny dialouge between some extremely interesting characters.

Although zombie is no Stone, or spielberg, he has a very interesting way about his films. The editing is awesome in this, the shots are awesome, the soundtrack is awesome and well thought out i may add. I am usually more of a drama genre person, but zombie has me hooked.

This might be okay, if there was some shred of a psychological thriller beneath the slashing. Zombie tries to make this a psychological piece, the cops versus the cultish murderers, but he fails. The characters have no respect for human decency or the sanctity of life.

OK, fine you have to do something different, but come on, a cheesy, happy and poppy radio tune soundtrack replacing the eerie gut wrenching psychotic audio from the first was a stupid mistake. Plus, I can't take any movie seriously that changes the actors of any lead character. Karen Black was fantastic as the rank, horribile toothed Mother, only to be replaced with the big boobed cop from Police Academy who couldn't act he way out of a wet sack. And for a bunch who were just about to kill each other on many occasions, the slow motion happy hug and kiss moment was just feeble.

I even got to see it for free and I still felt some how ripped off.The story line was extremely lacking even for a 'horror' movie. It's attempts to be disturbing actually left me bored as they were (to be honest) very unoriginal. I didn't find myself rooting for anyone (good bad or otherwise) but hoping they would all die and quickly so I could leave (had I wanted them to die because to the 'horrible' things they were doing, the movie would be getting a higher rating).I guess I do have a few slightly positive things to say about the film. It did contain a few interesting camera/editing tricks (wipes turning into pans that then reverse direction) the lighting and the color were nicely done but in failing to impress me plot wise or push the envelope for the disturbing factor, and for not even making an attempt to forge a emotional connection between any of the characters and the audience.This is the most disappointing film I have ever watched.

Rob Zombie has written, directed and produced a masterpiece. With a great new character in Chief Wydell and the continuing uneasiness of the OTIS, Baby and Captain Spaulding, Zombie creates a great story: the the acting is superb, violence is great, humor is well situated, and gore is just right. I also thought the way the movie was shot, using different lenses and camera angles, showed a great creative side in Zombie. Zombie is clearly picking up a lost art form in creating a great horror flick, without the teen-star slasher mentality. The Devils' Rejects was a great trip that made me want more. Rob Zombie will surely have a following from this movie. The question for Zombie becomes, what's next???",The Devil's Rejects

It was violent and had lots of bad talk, but I was more grossed out by the original dawn of the dead. That movie made me look away at points--one time when a zombie bites a large chunk out of a person in a close up. Also lacking in the movie was a story. Normally I wouldn't care, if there was action or good dialogue. But, the movie was too earnest and a bit cheesy. There wasn't too much to the movie. Not much happens--at all. I don't know what I expected really. I wasn't too fond of House of a thousand corpses. And what I liked about one, I liked about the other. Both movies were stylish and looked good--the visuals mixed with the music were really good. I didn't hate the movie. I just wanted more senseless crazy killing, than murders love their families too. The characters weren't out of control or sadistic enough. A movie that really scared me Was Twin Peaks: Come fire walk with me, I think that is what it is called. When it comes to directing, I give Rob Zombie his respect. He just needs more challenging plots or a crap load of weirdness. Overall, the movie was decent, but I can't say for sure.

Rob Zombie has made a film that transcends normal review (why do you think Roger Ebert felt compelled to give it 3 stars). I personally liked House of 1000 Corpses and like Rob's work. That being said I will give you one reason why I think this film will catch people off guard and do much better than anyone expects. I went to see this film at the last showing Friday in a theater filled with teenagers more interested in having fun than seeing a good movie. While waiting for the trailers to begin and even during them I felt like I was in a high school class room that had a substitute teacher with no control of the class. My Wife and I both thought we were going to have a hard time even trying to see and hear the movie. However, something strange happened. As the Devil's Rejects started everyone fell silent and as the movie progressed peoples heads sunk deeper into their seats. What happened? Well, the movie was so good, so dark, and honestly in your face that it changed the tone of the whole theater. Sure, the crowed nervously laughed at the appropriate times. Hell, they even cheered at times. But, the best thing was an entire sold out theater at midnight full of teenagers got it, they got the movie and the serious artistic and poetic tone of the film. They understood the evil possession that the sheriff displays trying to avenge his brothers death, they understood the anti-hero roll the Rejects take on, and they understood the cleansing of their souls at the hands of the insane sheriff. They cheered as if the Death Star was blown up when the Sheriff gets his due. Most of all they showed their understanding and approval. How did they do that? Simple, when you have a child or teenagers attention they respect you. They RESPECTED this movie and what it, and Rob Zombie was trying to achieve, and by respecting the film they showed me that there will be plenty of people that see this film and whether they want to admit it or not will feel compelled to respect it for what it is. I suspect their will be a lot of teenagers saying ""Dude, you gotta see this movie."" For the record I and my Wife, and our teenage Daughter all loved the film.

His sophomore effort is decidedly more stylish, and better put together than house. The images are less cartoonish and more striking than his first film, and in fact, the only thing that really ties the two together is the fact that the main characters are the same. Rejects lacks many of the more horrific/macabre elements of House, which will no doubt please some and annoy others. It is almost unfair to attempt to compare the two. The acting in Rejects is almost flawless, and features many actors well-known from classic horror films. The three main actors, Sid Haig, Bill Moseley, and Sheri Moon Zombie (the director's wife), are well-rounded and better developed, and not nearly as one-dimensional as they appeared in House. Moon Zombie has greatly improved in her role as Vera Ellen Firefly, or Baby for short. I'm not sure I would term this horror, it was more reminiscent of Badlands and Natural Born Killers. Extremely violent and graphic, I'm not sure how some of it got past the MPAA, but I'm glad it did.

I'd figured Rob Zombie was going to venture into the world of film-making sooner or later. Thankfully, it was sooner rather than later. The Devil's Rejects is quite a roller coaster ride from beginning to end. It grabs you and tightens the grip slowly as the film progresses, and the ending was a pretty good surprise.

It is good to see Rob Zombie using some classic character actors of horror's past (Dawn of the Dead, The Hills Have Eyes), as well as a few side characters that draw a line to TV's past (Three's Company) and a tangent line to todays's horror through the past (Any Which Way but Loose to Shaun of the Dead).All in all, a horrific ride through the countryside that may make you question why you are rooting for certain characters survival or absolution. The definitive feel of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre's setting mixed in with a time appropriate soundtrack lead the viewer down the path of suspense, and blood-filled horror. Enjoy the ride!",The Devil's Rejects
652,goretorpedo,"Sweet style, soft story",6,29 October 2005,"I really enjoyed the first installment of what appears to be another Lion's Gate horror franchise. I think it shows Rob Zombie has an iron set of $alls to make a sequel that is a sequel with an entirely different visual style than the first. He borrows(steals?) heavily from a completely different sub genre of horror movie than he did in the original. Last House on the Left and I Spit on Your Grave come to mind. This is entirely fresh yet completely unoriginal. What's original, I guess, is that no one else has thought to riff on these movies in a major theatrical movie in recent memory. You almost want to discount this movie as just a flashy exercise of a rock video director but you can't. There's too much going on and Zombie clearly wants to tell a story. And he does! There are truly terrifying moments. Some great music. And the actor performances, while often over the top, blend perfectly in this world. I'll see the third. And if Zombie keeps finding original fresh ""inspiration"" from those horror filmmakers before him, I'm in for the fourth.",The Devil's Rejects

It was a fantastic watch, full of the gore and violence that you want to see as a true horror fan, along with some funny comments between the brood of characters. I don't think that you could have gotten any better than this.Today, too many directors are trying to used a lot of fake imagery and have too many ""big time"" actors in them to produce something so well.However, Zombie brings in actors we all know, but just can't get there names on the spot and that gives it the classic doing of getting good acting out of his crew.

From the opening sequence to the last frame we're hit with an overwhelmingly violent and fun ride through the depths of depravity as our heroes (If you can call them that)Baby and Otis hit the road to escape the long arm of the Law. Joining them is the always classy Captain Spaulding played by the fantastic Sid Haig. What follows is a bloody tour of the lovely Texas countryside. Zombies visually gritty style is miles away from the campy House of 1000 Corpses, and is a huge step for him directorially. The film splits the good and the bad in such a way, you might even feel bad for the sadistic band of rejects, and come to loathe the hardassed pig tracking them across the state. Gone are the zombies and the only thing to fear watching this movie would be losing your lunch all over the floor of the already sticky movie theater floor. Consider this a warning to bring a bucket. But see it, watch it, loathe it or love it, you have to admit, this is one visually pleasing and fun film. 8/10 CF",The Devil's Rejects
656,killerspacesquid,Not the worst movie i've seen this year (that would be The Fantastic 4),8,26 July 2005,"I went into this film and i expected to be blown away, because the reviews on this site told me that this is by far one of the most brutal cinematic experiences of all time. Those are words i'm attracted to, as i am a fan of the insane, gory, brutal, and corrupt (in film). My first reaction at the end was, that was it? That's all? Where's the beef, the content? My second thought was that the ending wasn't the best it could have been. My third was that the movie was really cool. You ask yourself, how could it be cool if i didn't feel satisfied with the content or the ending? Well, this is perhaps the only film since the glorious pinnacle (the 70's) of the horror genre that has successfully captured the feel and energy of that time. The slide cuts, film grain, screen flicker, freeze-frames, and that music, oh that music. Stylistically this is the coolest thing i've seen in a long time. The use of Freebird alone is enough for it to be escalated to this point in my book. As a disclaimer, i think i shouldn't have watched the part of the film that was on the official website, i think it definitely ruined it for me, as i knew exactly what was going to happen to the Banjos. If you see both, you'll know that the teaser on the site is the entire pinnacle of the scenes that the Banjos star in, cut for cut. I'm sure it totally ruined that experience for me. As far as content, it wasn't sick enough for me to dislike the characters as much as everyone else seems to in their posts. if i hated anyone by the end, it would have been Sheriff Wydell. He was one sadistic bastard, and as far as i'm concerned, he was what was brutal and gained the film that ""R"" rating. I was glad to see him die, and as for the others, even though Otis proclaimed ""I am the devil, and I am here to do the devil's work"", I still didn't feel as though he or any of the rejects were really captured in that way on screen. Yes, they did very morally reprehensible things, but i didn't feel negative towards them, perhaps because they collectively have the best sense of humor. The whole ""tutti fruity"" scene is just hilarious. The end collage made me feel bad for them, because they just seemed like a bunch of guys i could go to the bar with. Bottom line. If you like horror, go see it. It won't revolutionize the genre (as others seem to think, and i was hoping for) but it will give you a nice sense of nostalgia.",The Devil's Rejects

The horror genre has hit a dry spell, so when House of 1000 Corpses came out a few years back, I was thrilled. A horror movie made by a true horror fan. Rob Zombie. Being a long time fan of his he did not disappointed. The sequel to House of 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects is something completely different from the first film. Rejects could stand on it's own as being one of the great American movies. It's part western, part exploitation. It's crude in some ways, and surprisingly touching in others. It's very well acted, and not full of blonde bimbos running around topless. It's smart and the look and direction of the film blew me away. The 70's rock soundtrack added beautifully to the dirty, gritty scenery. Rejects is not a film for everyone. The violence is intense, the language rough, but fans of Rob and the first film I think will be very impressed.",The Devil's Rejects

The texture of the film is the only thing worth seeing and I could have just as easily waited for the cable TV showing for that. (I wouldn't even waste the money renting a DVD.) Lots of rust, sweat, grime, filth, etc. Even still, Easterbrook and Moon-Zombie's teeth were way too straight and clean for me to believe that they were the skanks they were supposed to be. Absolutely no plot to speak of. I was sorely disappointed. Even if you go for the gore, it's lame and not believable. Tip for Rob Zombie: Getting shot by a gun really HURTS and people DIE from that. I can not believe how many rave reviews I have seen posted here, after seeing this 'home movie'. I suspect that it's heavily loaded with Rob Zombie lemmings, who believe that anything this guy makes is pure gold.",The Devil's Rejects

My expectations were incredibly high so imagine my surprise when my expectations were far exceeded! This is an amazing example of Grindhouse Cinema. Brutal and uncompromising from beginning to end. What a treat! Rob Zombie has grown by leaps and bounds as a director and it shows.Rejects is a VERY well crafted example of the genre. The script was very well written and the soundtrack complements the 1978 setting perfectly. I found myself completely immersed in the Rejects world and I was even cheering them on. (Note: I am a little sick and twisted... most viewers are not likely to have the same reaction)I would compare the Devil's Rejects favorably to other classics such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Last House on the Left, Deranged, The Hills have Eyes, Two Lane Blacktop, and Vanishing Point.

Again this was a real let down for me, maybe the guys that write and produce the commercials should make a movie since the commercials were actually better than actual movie.

I'm barely inclined to even write about a film that is so unbelievably bad that for the first time in my entire life, I considered walking out on a movie. As far as I see it, The Devil's Rejects is the manifestation of Rob Zombie's dream to see all of his sickest fantasies crammed into one very long movie. I love dark, edgy, violent movies. I love movies like, Se7en, Saw, Dawn of the Dead, and The Silence of the Lambs, but The Devil's Rejects has absolutely none of the elements that make the previous films enjoyable. The Devil's Rejects is violence without purpose or style. It's just a bunch of sick junk pond sick-Os whom the audience (at least one would hope) isn't supposed to like, killing people for whom the audience doesn't really care, while reciting inanely immature dialog. Here's a typical string of witty repartee:Otis: Hey, f**k you, bitch Baby: No, f**k you! Otis: No, bitch, f**k you!Brilliant, no? This is a ""horror"" movie in that it's full of brutal killing, but it's not at all suspenseful. It's obvious that people are going to die, it's just a matter of how and the degree of brutality. It's hard to sit through a movie in which none of the characters are likable, the dialog is juvenile and the plot is boring AND predictable. I cannot understand all the rave reviews posted on IMDb. Maybe I'm the problem. Maybe watching people die gruesome and realistic deaths for 2 solid hours for no particular reason is awesome and I just don't ""get"" it. Maybe, but I hope not.",The Devil's Rejects

The only way this pseudo-snuff film could have worked would be if it simply killed itself. Really, this movie is horrible. Not bad or humorous enough to be campy, too poorly written to be scary, I came to the conclussion that Rob Zombie's purpose of making this film was to make us all whistfull for the mature, deep, and inovative styling's of Zombie's music. Trust me... I loved 'They Live' and 'Dead Alive' for their campy class. This film is devoid of anything remotely interesting.

I can only believe Rob Zombie himself has registered under so many names, or that the production company responsible hired people to do so. All I know is that I spent 10 hard earned dollars on this movie, and not only do I want my money back, I want them to pay me ten times that much to compensate me for this utter waste of my time.I'd say this was morally reprehensible, vile, corrupt - but the movie really is not good enough to give it that much credit. It didn't scare me. It didn't repulse me. It just wanted me to go take a shower. Or better yet a full body chemical peel. Not only that, this isn't a ""horror"" movie at all. It's more of a road movie as we follow the ""heroes,"" who are a group of bad acting psychopaths who like to rip people's faces off with knives, shoot, gouge, etc. I mean, that's about it for their complexity. They take hostages where they can, kill them however they can, and say the word ""f@#k"" like it was salt on a pretzel. Rob Zombie even cast his wife, and for some reason he keeps showing us her ass. Maybe he wanted us to be jealous or something. Well, just because you appreciate it doesn't mean the rest of us will.And that about sums up this movie. It's basically a one man riff job of bits from other films all shoved inside and blenderized and spat back out as if it's going to make some impact - all of Rob Zombie's masturbatory movie fantasies splooged on the movie audience for your viewing pleasure. He makes movies like some little kid jacking off to those old ""Faces Of Death"" flicks. And that's about his level of craft.Now if you say ""he just doesn't like this kind of movie"" - I'd say you're right if you mean a bad movie. If you mean horror films, violent films, you're wrong. I like any kind of movie if it's well done for what it is and moves me in some way, even if it terrifies me. This movie only moved me enough to make me want to save any fellow human beings that may be sitting on the fence about seeing it to think twice.

Bill Moseley does a wonderful job playing deranged Otis, Sheri Moon Zombie thrills as the beautiful and sexy Baby, and Sid Haig impresses the audience as Captain ""Cutter"" Spaulding. The gritty film style and fast paced action are amazing to watch. Characters are given great depth and you almost feel like you are there watching this all take place. There are also a few great instances of dark humour that add to the experience. Rob Zombie is definitely a master at film-making, and I would highly recommend this movie!

Yes we all know that Zombie pays homage to 70's horror but, in no way should this be compared to LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. They are in no way simuliar. Rejects at least has more of a story then HOUSE ON THE LEFT. The comedic role of Sid Haig, especially in the beginning, is GREAT. Even though nothing was explained in 1000 Corpse, it doesn't matter. Sure you would like there to be more of a story, like more MARX BROTHER references but we all can't get what we want. I though that the ending was perfect for this movie, I did not see any editing flaws in this move, which is hard to say for a lot of movies.

Not only does this film have major plot flaws (e.g., how the hell does the mutant-looking killer fit in with the story at all?), and has absolutely no scary moments at all, but it's entire premise is about as socially and ethically acceptable as a documentary expounding upon the delights of killing baby harp seals, or a song and dance number about the greatness of the Holocaust. The film literally advocates the torture and murder of other human beings. I can handle a movie where people are tortured and killed, don't get me wrong, for I have seen my fair share of Freddie/Halloween type movies, but never before have I run into a film that is obviously trying to tell the audience that the massive spilling of blood and screaming is a GOOD thing.

In a way the film tried to portray the characters like that however Mr Zombie missed the mark and tries all the time to portray human qualities in the sick and twisted family. With the film opening to the family sleeping in a stuffy fly infested house one may think oh OK should be easy to take down but nope Mr Zombie treats the viewer to a good 10 minutes of what can only be described as verbal garbage, over exaggerating the threat inside the house. Talking of the police what police force in the world is that inept that they wouldn't check local motels and surrounding areas if some of them exaggerated. The whole film in my opinion feels like a mind map of a child with attention deficit disorder. The characters act like their is depth to them and there undoubtedly is however the plot doesn't stay in the same place for long enough to understand it. The directors view on the characters is in a way condescending at the end scene is there to attempt to pull at the heart strings? Is the viewer just meant to forget the small fact they cut a mans face off and gave it his girlfriend? The policeman in the end is portrayed as bad but if you came face to face with the people who he is insane over you would be the same. In conclusion before I become to annoyed at how Zombie got the green light on this film I will say the plot is like a roundabout never really goes anyway. Acting was decent and some witty lines however fair too perverse to really like. The editing was stylish and the music was good but thats it. As a film it is a poor attempt at art-house.

If I'd known it was the sequel to ...corpses I probably wouldn't have bothered going to see it, but thats beside the point. You just get the feeling while watching these films that Rob Zombie just thought ""I want 2 hours of people getting mutilated"" which is all well and good if thats your bag but don't circulate it around the world and charge people to see it. The storyline (if you could call it that) is so poor its frustrating. I am usually very tolerant of all films and would never consider leaving the cinema early but I was actually praying for the end credits to come on screen as this mind-numbing gore fest drew to a close. I hope to God that Zombie never makes a sequel to this movie. Please PLEASE do not go and see this movie (unless you liked House of 1000 Corpses, in which case just watch that movie again as they are practically identical). This is such a poor movie you will be so disappointed if you have paid to watch it.",The Devil's Rejects
678,adam131281,Absolute Rubbish,1,31 March 2007,"I was under the impression this was going to be a horror in the vain of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or even Hills have Eyes. It's not. It's rubbish. There's no suspense, no surprises & certainly no fear factor at all. For a horror to scare me you need an unrelenting evil being such as Leather Face or Michael Myers. There's not a ""baddie"" in this film that I think could actually do me in a fight in fact they come across as a bit pathetic, especially the skinny guy with a pot belly. To make matters worse this joker is meant to be some sort of inbred hick living in a backward land but he talks about Mark Twain & I think even quotes him. Where has he learnt all this from? i studied it at school & can barely remember him! I'm all up for sex, swearing & gore in a movie but not when it's just gratuitous & a device that blatantly is just used to appeal to teenage lads. Don't know if this is meant to be comedic but it could be considering how poor this film is. Also the music doesn't fit in at all. They try to make it sound scary but once you realise they're only tough if they've got a gun in their hand the ""Devils Rejects"" come across as pathetic losers. Avoid at all costs. Don't waste your life with it like I did. This Rob Zombie director seems to have the right name, definitely the same brain capacity as one anyway.",The Devil's Rejects
679,scott-1025,Old and New Horror Come Together with The Devil's Rejects,9,18 August 2005,"I am a huge fan of horror movies, particularly from the 70s. That is why I was greatly impressed with Rob Zombie's second effort, The Devil's Rejects.Zombie tips his hat to the many great horror/exploitation films of the 70s such as Last House on the Left (with the girl hitting the woman at Baby's request) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (with the creepy shots of the cattle at the end of the film).As many commenters have already noted, this film took on a completely different style and flavor. The vivid colors of the first film were replaced with grainy, washed out colors that hearken back to the stripped down, low-budget films of the 70s. House of a 1,000 Corpses emphasized the supernatural, unstoppable killer aspect of films like Halloween. Devil's Rejects is filled with the raw brutality of films such as The Hills Have Eyes.This does not mean that Zombie in his directing and writing is merely derivative. He offers his own spin on the ""revenge"" horror film, such as Sheriff Wydell's rage over his brother's murder ultimately causing Wydell's own demise at the end of the film.My only criticism with this film is its overt use of 70s rock music. Sometimes it added to the tension and flow of the film but sometime it distracted from it. However, this is faint criticism that succeeds on so many levels from the acting to the atmosphere.I must say that I enjoyed House of a 1,000 Corpses better, but The Devil's Rejects did not disappoint. Movies with this much brutality, intelligence, and yes, reverence for past films are not made any more. Horror movies today for the most part follow trends. Zombie shows that he sets them.",The Devil's Rejects
680,mrkaos,"Senseless, shocking, disgustingly brutal!... I Loved every minute of it.",10,22 August 2005,"Like Rob says himself, the seventies was a great time for movies. All those breakthroughs in different genres. Notably, the films that shocked and scared us all half to death. Directors were churning out blood spattered shocks and scares that hadn't been seen before and it worked a treat. Unfortunately after that, it all went wrong. Horror went stupid after that and has only really started making a notable comeback since maybe the late nineties. But we still hadn't seen anything that matched up to the shocks that were delivered in the seventies. The Texas chainsaw massacre is a perfect example. Still to this day one of the most brutally shocking movies I have ever seen, but never really bettered in its seemingly senseless brutality. Until I saw The devils rejects. Rob has brought something back to cinema that we haven't seen for a very long time. I had my girlfriend demanding that we leave the cinema and that she didn't think she could watch any more. That in itself, with my own added shock at what we were watching told me everything i needed to know. True seventies style shock cinema is back, and it is all thanks to the intriguingly artistic and sadistic mind of Rob zombie.",The Devil's Rejects

682,lady_saphrin,Sadistic Horror that makes you think,10,14 September 2005,"I get really frustrated when I read reviews of people bashing this movie because it glorifies murder, rape, necrophilia, etc... Look, the point of this movie is to NOT want them to get out in the end. Most people can see that though, but for the few who don't, I'm sorry that you're stupid. This movie in no way glorifies, but shows us what really can happen in life. In a way, some people can identify and somehow understand the personalities that lie deeper in serial killers. We all know that serial killers can be normal people and you can like them, not saying that any one of these three characters are anywhere on the normal standards to society. This movie tries to make a point that in the end, you should realize that you should not be cheering them on. You want them to lose, you want them win. Hell, you just want them to go hide somewhere because in this movie, they're real people in parts just like you and me. But hey, it's a movie. It's not real life. You won't ever meet these people. Deal with it. It's a fun horror movie. It's scary; it's gory. But it's a true horror. It makes you really think and wonder about what is really going on around us today. Rob Zombie didn't think this up from his own imagination. Everyone has seen things, and read things about different murders. This is just another case of that, not glorified, but showing the gritty way life is. It's not always what you would want it to be. I was watching something where Bill Moseley was talking about how upset he was doing the scene in the motel, and Rob said something to him along the lines of art isn't always beautiful. There you go. That's the whole idea of the movie. It's art looking into the deeper, darker side of our sadistic human nature.",The Devil's Rejects
683,slidog313,A style of it's own...,8,15 August 2006,"In 2003 when Rob Zombie came out with his film House of 1000 Corpses they were many mixed reviews of it, some calling it a new style of horror others calling it a sick movie that deliberately ripped-off Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I happened to agree with the others, even though 'House' was one of the best horror movies to come out it still felt like a very tired attempt as a movie in certain spots.In 2005 Devil's Rejects comes out, the 70's style horror movie that is just there whether you like it of not. It's a movie with shaky camera work, fade outs, fade ins, slow time, just everything that makes this film feel like an excuse to test out ones movie making skills, and it does it well.The movie starts out with around 30 cops surrounding the Firefly house,and threatening to open fire if they don't peacefully come out.Things go wrong leaving multiple cops dead and one family member. Whilst the mother is comforting her dying son the other Fireflys are left to run away and later regroup with Captian Spaulding, after the two family members take hostage of a family at a hotel.The movie is definitely violent and gruesome and has it's moments of nudity and language, but it's all done to show you the minds of the Firefly family who are villains and the heroes. At times you will feel uncomfortable watching this and other times you'll feel this is a brilliant work of art which all should see.By the time the movie's credits roll you are nothing short of amazed, satisfied, shocked and feel that Zombie had given his characters a fitting closing to their tale.I would give this movie higher than an 8 but some parts seemed to drag on, and others seemed a little unnecessary. This movie is still very enjoyable and I hope more will come out with as much style and surprise as this one.",The Devil's Rejects

Almost every horror flick that I saw pales in comparison to ""The Devils Rejects"".I did see bits and pieces of ""House1Kcorpses"",but to call TDR a sequel of the previous film is a bit unfair.It is quite obvious that Rob Zombie had quite a bit more money to work with.Also,the cinematography is incredible, especially the desert scenes.The acting was surprisingly excellent, and I hate to say that the plot, if there is one, is somewhat credible. Sid Haig and Bill Moseley are unbelievable, Sherri Moon has a great ass. Let's leave it at that. The movie is a cavalcade of 70's B TV and movie stars. It is a mindless,violent 2 hour trip that is sometimes disturbing but nonetheless fascinating. There is one small twist at the end.The best part of the movie?The soundtrack....pure and simple genius. As it should be. Good Job Rob....let's hope this is just the beginning.",The Devil's Rejects
685,stevecain,Wow! Excellent Movie.,10,30 November 2005,"Best movie I've seen in a few years. Rob Zombie is maturing nicely.For all the haters who missed the plot of the movie, It's about the existence and growth of the devil and Satanic Cults. In some places in the movie, like the brief scene from the talk show it is hinted at. Those interested can find a lot more detail on the DVD extras. A lot more scenes to watch. Especially the Unrated Directors cut.There are some elements of ""snuff"" to this film. When Otis stabbed the maid bending over Baby in the road, it was real. The expression you see on her face is real pain. She was wearing a protective pad on her back, and thought it would stop the knife blade, but the knife missed the shield and went into her back. And the opening scene of the ""dead"" girl being dragged through the woods by Tiny is a real live actress. Looks painful huh? It was.It's some pretty bold stuff on Zombie's part.Oh, in case anyone missed it, Otis is the devil.So for all you who hated this film, ha ha, jokes on you! You have just participated in a Satanic Ceremony! And for those of you who say you hated this film, but some how find yourself watching Zombie's next film, as many of you will, he has accomplished one of his goals.I gotta watch it again.",The Devil's Rejects

There isn't much of a plot so you shouldn't expect it to move much, the same scenes play over and over; it's totally predictable. The first thirty minutes were jam-packed with shameless scenes of women's breasts then the last hour was blood, guts, and murder. There are no deeper meanings, no hidden motives, just a childish writer/director Rob Zombie who was allowed to make not one, but two of these movies simply because he has the money to pay off the required people. Any idiot with a brain can think of nine million different ways to kill people, it's what little boys do when they're six....sorry Rob, grow up.If there's a three, I want to see Rob Zombie shoot himself in the movie, I may watch it then.

This sequel is merely annoying and neither film comes close to having the suspense or genuine disturbing atmosphere of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. These films are closer in feel to The Sadist, another film with no redeeming characters. The victims in Zombie's films seldom attempt to defend themselves, whine a lot and eventually die, sometimes in gory detail.

It is a shame that Zombie chose to taint so many fantastic songs with his rubbish. The recent re-do of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a superior movie in many respects. For that matter, the low budget rip-off version of ""War of the Worlds"" that sought to trick people in to thinking it was Speilburg's version was a much better film than this one.

Rob Zombie uses techniques which are not too dissimilar from what Quentin Tarrentino uses in his movies. The ""light music"" followed by scenes of gore really bring the contrast between horror and happiness to fruition. I've seen this movie 5 times now, and it just gets better every time i watch it. If u haven't seen it, get it, you wont be disappointed. The people who say this movie is awful are no doubt opposed to anything resembling horror. In my opinion this is not horror, this is a light comedy, easy watching. The first half has a few executions, but for non-liberal's the way john quincy wydell goes about bringing these people to ""justice"" is exactly how you would go about it. In most movies the cop ""walks the line"" and they get 12 years in prison, then their out for a sequel. Not in this. John Quincy's brother puts it nicely: ""i want these mother fkers, DEAD"", with a lot of torture in the process. The ending can be seen as a tad disappointing the first time you see it, but after you realise what they have gone through you appreciate the pain given in retribution.

691,Sinistrious,"Brutal, sadistic and offensive...but a brilliant film regardless.",9,17 January 2006,"In a follow up of the lives of Otis Driftwood, Baby Firefly and Captain Spaulding, The Devil's Rejects takes us on an excruciating 109 minute journey in which many filmmakers have tried in the past to succeed, only to fail. Rob Zombie however pulls it off with flying colors.Regardless if you loved it or hated it, The Devil's Rejects served it's purpose absolutely, which was to evoke a reaction out of the audience. Very few people have been able to simply state that they didn't like this movie simply because they didn't like it. Many state how they were appalled, disgusted, offended, traumatized and most importantly, how they hated the main characters of this movie. The fans however state just the opposite.Which is exactly why this movie has succeeded. If the reaction of the viewers was 'meh, it was OK', that would be a different story. But with a film like The Devil's Rejects, there is rarely a position for fence sitting, as you either love it or you hate it.Which is why Mr Zombie deserves applause. Rarely do we get villains in movies nowadays that genuinely fulfill a need to be hated and loathed. The actions of these characters are despicable and wrong, and yet strangely, Mr Zombie somehow blurs the lines of right and wrong by introducing a straight arrow law man that is played impressively brilliant by William Forsythe who ends up forsaking his 'duties' and crosses that moral boundary to become a revenge seeking, vengeance driven hero (or anti-hero, dependant upon your perception).There are moments in this film that will likely make you cringe, wince and probably turn away while others will make you laugh, snicker and forget that you are somehow liking the Reject's (if only for a moment). It is the actors themselves that drive this movie, as each plays their part with a startling conviction.Mr Zombie cleverly hides small underlying notations and messages that many will fail to see, as they will not be able to see past the obvious intent to startle and offend. Sadly for these people, they will never truly get what this movie is about. But that is alright, as this movie is by no means 'made for everyone'.If you think you are able to stomach a film depicting brutal and sadistic acts littered with obscene language, that is also brilliantly acted and written, choreographed and photographed with an incredible soundtrack, then by all means view this movie. Chances are you will be one of those who are able to see what Rob Zombie was trying to accomplish. Otherwise just pass up this film, else you will be one of the many who are clogging up the forums with the overdone 'I hate this movie' threads.9/10 stars.",The Devil's Rejects

This performance & what Rob Zombie has done for horror movies is hands down, second to none, the epitome of what a scary film should embody. To simply put it, I found it to be fantastically brilliant! I thoroughly appreciated the unique talent, stupendous taste & above all the countless hours put into making such a colorful picture. There haven't been any TRUE great slasher movies in quite some time other than what he's been able to accomplish & master these past few years with his two eye-opening flicks. With that said I realize that I did indeed make mention that this would be a short & snappy rundown of ""The Devils' Rejects"" however I find it next to impossible not to give extended credit to such an unparalleled film as well as a pure genius.

Rob Zombie deserves kudos for the 70s setting; he did that well. However, aside from some interesting scene transitions, and the opening gun battle, this movie was nothing more than a big budget snuff film. If you're a sadist, then you might enjoy it, but overall, it had little to offer, since Rob Zombie telegraphs the ending right from the opening scene.Bottom Line: Save your money, this film is a waste of time to watch.",The Devil's Rejects

I rented it but plan on adding it to my collection of movies to entertain my guests. I expected more blood and gore and was pleased that it was not overdone as some other movies that seem to make that the central theme. People on the run with no hope of settling down to a normal life and yet act as if all is fine are not the best of role models and would caution that the movie is not made for those in their teenage years.

696,cgroveman,One hell of a ride,9,16 November 2005,"If you liked ""House of 1000 Corpses"", you'll probably like this film. It has many of the same characters, even more violence and gore, and a wicked ending that keeps you on edge and glued to your seat. As sequels go, it is much better than most and doesn't disappoint. It picks up the story line of Corpses perfectly and never has you say ""wait that's not right"" or ""what happened to this or so-and-so"". It does have a different feel and rhythm to ""Corpses"". ""Corpses"" is the ultimate Halloween horror film and the rhythm is more consistent and forward moving. Devil's Rejects is more ""Natural Born Killers"" and the rhythm changes from scene to scene - that is some scenes seem to go quickly in both actual time and plot, and others seem slow. OK, here's the spoiler and to do it I have to take issue with a previous review. It is not just brutal, it is extremely violent, very bloody, and very gory. Some examples: slow-mo close ups of bullets penetrating and tearing away flesh, a man's brains lying next to his bashed and broken skull, the remnants of a woman's intestines and other body parts strewn 30 yards down the road after being hit by a semi, more spewing blood than the elevators in ""The Shining"", and so on. It is bloody. The most realistic and shocking violence I had seen previously was ""Irreversible"", and I have to say, that if for nothing more than the quantity of blood, guts and gore, this film probably tops it. However, the violence is not gratuitous in that it is an integral part of the film. Overall it was a very well done sequel. It's a bloody, bad ass, horror flick that actually has good dialog, good directing, a plausible plot, and even somewhat thought provoking.

Priscilla Barnes never did do much after ""Three's Company"" and by her performance in this movie, I can see why. Geoffrey Lewis was better in the Clint Eastwood movies. I don't know if age has set in, but even though he was never a great actor, he used to be better than this. The only character that seemed halfway real was ""Mama Firefly"".

In the documentary of the movie director Rob Zombie as well as the actors talk often about ""humanity"" - that is one of the vital reasons this movie works on many levels. It is of course a gore filled extravaganza of excess, but that could and would never work without the director's empathetic approach to all the characters - whether those slaughtered by the Firefly clan, or the clan themselves as they are laid into by the sheriff. One almost feels guilty to side with them towards the end, but Zombies transition at the ranch which takes them from hunter to hunted is a brilliant stroke of genius. Too many people will be turned off by this film without knowing what it is. It is not horror, it is not action, it is not slasher, it is not thriller - it is at its very essence a character based piece - unfortunately, the very nature of those characters may keep sensitive viewers from seeing what will soon be a classic and horrific character study.",The Devil's Rejects

I think Rob Zombie is a master story teller and I have not yet came across anything he has done that I don't like, I love his music, his movies and his comics.

I have a certain weak spot for horror films, I tend to prefer the more psychological films (ie: The Shining and The Omen) I was never a huge fan of the slasher genre. I found that The House of a 1000 Corpses was one of the worst films I had seen in years and was surprised that someone with Rob Zombie's talent would make such garbage for his film debut. I avoided The Devil's Rejects in theaters at all costs. I slowly started to hear good word of mouth for the film and rented it. WOW! I never thought a film like this would stick with me for so long. The Devil's Rejects is easily one of the best films of 2005. It is pure 1970's grind house cinema. After watching this movie you will want to bathe feeling dirty watching it and even dirtier for enjoying it so much. The tone of this film is more serious although it features some of the funniest lines I've heard in a while. The violence is disturbing and sadistic but not gory. Many people have called this film gory but thats not true. The ideas are disturbing and most of the horrific moments are left to the viewer's imagination (Think the Shower Scene from Psycho). The acting is surprisingly good and has some of the best dialog you will hear this year. Even the soundtrack comprised of mostly classic Southern Rock fits the film like a glove. Do not consider this film as a horror film think of it more as Thelma and Louise Meet the Manson Family.

One of the best movies I've ever seen!! THe movie was smart, well written, and beautiful. The only thing that kinda freaked me out was the skin mask. It was pretty gross. The guy that played Otis looks a lot like Charles Manson. THat was kinda creepy too. But it was awesome and kind of sexual.

The screen writing is superb and the cast of characters are remarkable. I am a big fan of horror movies and this movie is great. I guess it will be deemed a cult movie because of so many whinny people complaining about the violence and nudity. How many movies have you ever seen where a psycho tells someone to pray to their god and mock that god before killing them? How many movies do you see a clown scar a child for life by telling them that down the road if he doesn't have a reason for disliking clowns that his whole family will be killed? The answer to these two questions is none. This movie is completely original. It is a dark movie that actually has the watcher pulling for a Manson type of family. The family who slays together stays together. Only Zombie could pull together such a fine cast of B movie stars.

Why did She decide to do her first nude scene on a grade f horror flick? They must be desperate for a paycheck or they just don't care.

705,CRMeyer,Rob Zombie: exploitation's reject,1,16 December 2005,"What do Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, and Tobe Hooper all share in common? Well, for one thing they were all ripped off by Rob Zombie. I guess The Devil's Rejects is meant to be an ""homage,"" but it was more like a patchwork of scenes stolen from better films. Its Chainsaw Massacre, Bonnie and Clyde, The Wild Bunch, and Taxi Driver, but watered down to remove all of their irony and suspense. Zombie attempts to make an original addition to the anti-hero genre by placing a family of serial killers at the center of his film. But, ultimately the film fails because he can't seem to make the audience connect with the protagonists in any way. This is largely because any attempt to gather sympathy for the protagonists is overwhelmed by the brutal, unmotivated mass murders and torture that they are engaged in throughout the film. From the opening shots of mutilated corpses to the end scene where the killers' unapologetically revel in their despicable acts - just makes the viewer numb. If a director can't drum up some sympathy for his heroes or find some way to make us understand what motivates them to do what they do, then he at least needs to make his film original or interesting. It certainly can't be original if most of its borrowed. And it wasn't very interesting watching a gang of mass murderers drive around in a van eating ice cream and trading expletives.However, if you like over-the-top, unmotivated violence, or if you're tired of films with a moral center then this is the film for you. Personally, I think the only reason to watch this horrible film is that if enough people do so it might keep Rob Zombie from going back to writing crappy songs.",The Devil's Rejects
706,babygurl_luvs_u69,I loved the movie. It was AWESOME...,10,5 December 2005,"I loved the movie. It was awesome. My boyfriend says ""I'd like to think of myself as a small time movie critic b/c I've seen thousands of movies. It's my life. For a first time movie director Rob Zombie made it seem like he had directed hundreds of movies. The story line was to good for words. It has a laugh now, cry later feel to it."" In the first movie Zombie had a way of making the Rejects seem like cold heartless murderers but in this movie he actually showed them like people and you really connect with them. It shows that anyone could be a killer, everyone has that crazy side to them. If you could have people afraid to walk around their own houses in the dark using only music then you should really consider the horror movie business. I think everyone who watches these movies should promote them as much as possible so that Rob Zombie will continue to make awesome horror movies. His sick sadistic dry-humor and 50s horror comic feel made the movies what they are. The Best Horror movies I've seen since The Shining. Steve King and Wes Craven better watch their jobs for the Zombie is on the rise.",The Devil's Rejects
707,mburks,Complete Crap.,1,8 December 2005,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a fan of B-rated horror movies, but this was a joke. We now know why Rob Zombie is a musician and not a director. Half of all the dialog was the F-word, and the characters were flat out stupid. The movie opens with the character who will obviously save the rejects in the end. He is a giant mutant named Tiny, how original. The next two hours is a contest of who can use the F-word the most and basically gross out the audience with their actions and hygiene. Throw in some gay ass and unexplainable Elvis and Grouch Marx references and you have one big steaming pile of crap.

I was hoping for Rob to throw in his music to the soundtrack for rejects, but the 70's southern rock compensated well. A lot of people will say that this movie completely sucks, but then again half the world is infested with idiots. As for the rest of you....then you are in for a treat.

The cinematography, the sets, the wardrobe, and the sound track were all dead on. The characters were both hilarious and incredibly horrifying at the same time. William Forsythe turned in a fantastic performance as Sheriff Wydell. And Sheri Moon Zombie is both a talented actress and extremely sexy! I have to confess that I have not yet seen House of 1000 Corpses, but if its as good as the sequel then we have a winner there too.I give this one a solid A",The Devil's Rejects
710,timecrunch,only viewable for comic value,1,15 January 2006,"this film is in my top 3 worst films of all time along with ""Merlin's shop of mystical wonders"" and ""Harvesters"". All three of these films share horrible continuity errors, pointless subplots, and awful directing. Rejects is a stupid film. Clearly you do not expect a deep and philosophical plot... it's a gore movie; but there is not a lot of gore, and a load of crap about satanism. The devil does not even come into it though. Devils rejects is just a nickname for the ""gang"". The sheriff looking for the gang, decides instead to adopt their approach and burn them alive/torture them (one torture is stupidly reminiscent of Jesus being nailed to the cross) instead of arresting them. The rejects are then saved by a random orc, who then proceeds to destroy himself. The film ends with a stupid montage about how great the rejects are - the director clearly forgetting which characters are which.This film also includes possibly the worst scene in recent cinema history In an attempt to add to the appeal of this movie to new audiences, they drag in a load of crap about groucho marx. Some groucho marx fanatic is called in by the sheriff's office for help in the investigation. When he arrives he offends elvis so the sheriff threatens to kill him. This does not enrich the plot in any way, and just makes you scream in horror at the writing when you see it. Then again this is good for continuity as the entire film does not enrich the plot in any way.Subtitles are a must for this film (if you want to hear the crap they're saying) The music was pasted on at the last minute with no regard to if people are speaking at the time, so much of the dialogue is obscured by other noises. The dialogue itself is completely nonsensical. Not more than two words are uttered in a row before they swear - and they are forced to repeat most lines as the characters all have unexplained hearing problems.in all, along with the other two films mentioned, this film is a must see for the connoisseur of the awful film. it's a very fulfilling experience to see how bad human creations can be.",The Devil's Rejects
711,cryptic303,"It's OK to call crap ""crap.""",1,3 November 2012,"I just sat through this film again to a degree today while cleaning. My girlfriend hadn't seen it and chose it from ""on demand"" because she figured it would be fine to have in the background while we cleaned up the place. With that, coupled with the glowing reviews I've read here, and having heard similar glowing reviews from friends, I'm inclined to write a review for this puerile garbage.This movie is not an homage to any 70s exploitation films or horror. It is, quite simply, a rather poorly executed piece of hackery. In the 70s, the movies that numerous hipster clowns claim this pays homage to actually shocked. The level of violence and more explicit depictions of certain themes had not been done by Hollywood before. They were novel in that sense, and their artistic merit opened up discussions that changed cinema. But, by the time you've reached 2005, the same can simply not be said. ""The Devil's Rejects"" did not explore any new territory or push any boundaries in this era. It was nothing but a lazy thinly veiled clone of movies that had been done before, but with even worse acting and writing.Don't agree? Check out the other horror or violence driven entries that came to be after 2000. ""Martyrs"" is one example, which came out in 2008. Unlike ""The Devil's Rejects,"" the depictions of violence in ""Martyrs"" actually made me uncomfortable rather than bored as a result of sheer unoriginality. In addition, there was actually an interesting story presented throughout ""Martyrs,"" rather than a completely absent story here. It's possible to still push the envelope, as movies like ""Martyrs"" has shown. ""The Devil's Rejects"" failed to do that.The excuses made about how the poor writing, editing, acting and filming were intentional are as valid and honest as when Tommy Wiseau said he intentionally meant for ""The Room"" to be awful or when Pee Wee Herman famously fell of his bike in a classic and ""meant to do that."" The film is amateur because it was written and directed by an amateur who cast amateurs in leading roles. It wasn't some ""ironic joke"" or artistic homage in the way that it sucked. It just sucked.There's nothing deeper to it than that. It was just a bad utterly boring movie and nothing more. The only thing ""shocking"" about it is that it wasn't a straight to DVD release at the time.",The Devil's Rejects
712,vikings368,Worst movie ever!!,1,8 January 2006,"This has got to be one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I liked the bad ass cop. The music didn't even go with the movie. It was like combining music that the Telettubies made and combining it with a bunch of sadistic psycho serial killers. They just don't go together. Also, as the movie kept progressing, the producer made the killer's seem like a bunch of heroes, with them saving each other and coming to the rescue at the very last second. Also, the characters personalities didn't fit. When they weren't killing people, they kept acting like a bunch of humorous people that are so nice and submit to your every need. They needed to act more like killers all the time. Like when someone points a gun at them, they should just beat the living hell out of 'em. They shouldn't be all happy and stuff, and should just ACT LIKE F'N KILLERS!! Even I could have made better characters out of them, and i'm still in high school. The personalities of these people need a whole lot of work. The only good character was the cop. He had the best personality in the whole movie. He acted like more of a killer(and a bad ass) than the freaking guys whole murder people for a living! I mean, come on!! Those two Mexicans were more hardcore than them, and they were only in the movie for like a total of 10 minutes. Anyway, there are so many negativity's about this movie that I could ramble on for hours. This movie at the most deserves a 3. If you rate it more than that, then you're as sick and twisted as the Firefly family. Don't watch this movie; it is waste of time and money. I would have rated it lower but, the dumb rating system doesn't go into the negatives. Goodbye, and remember, stay away from this awful thing that people call a movie.",The Devil's Rejects

They like to see the same movie, the same script, but whit a different number at the end of the title. For that, craps like Friday 13th has got a lot of fans. But, thanks to god, Rob choose another way. If House Of 1000 Corpses was a masterpiece who walked between the sadism and the ridiculous, with a lot of supernatural colors and angles. This time, he choose for the realism and makes an almost melancholy Road Movie who tries to show us to the psycho killer like a lovely family.

715,scott-1266,America is Dead: An Essay on The Devil's Rejects,10,18 January 2006,"America is Dead: Why The Devil's Rejects is the Most Important Horror Film of the DecadeTHE DEVIL'S REJECTS made me angry. Don't get me wrong, I loved Rob Zombie's new film. Less a formal sequel to HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES than an unofficial follow-up to the anything-goes horror films of the 1970s, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS shows us what would happen if the out-of-control families of Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and THE HILLS HAVE EYES had to finally face the music. Here is the epilogue to the adventures of every post-post-nuclear family, the final result of the American Dream gone too far. A story that asks what would happen if the average American family were cut loose, allowed to consume, experience and destroy anything and everything with which they came in contact. Sound familiar? It should. The Firefly family is not so different from any other family: dysfunctional, self-loyal, and dangerous if crossed. Sure, they murder indiscriminately, with no thought to the ramifications of their actions beyond the immediate gratification they receive through committing violence; but so much of everything we do as Americans is harmful to other people. Whether it's the starving homeless we ignore on the streets or the sweatshop products we wear or the oil we consume from third world countries our governments deliberately keep in the dark ages with sanctions, there is blood on our hands. And how appropriate that this story takes place in the 1970s, the last somewhat ""innocent"" days of the US, the beginning of the end. Kennedy and King were dead, the peace movement (despite being somewhat instrumental in the end of the Viet Nam war) had failed, the soul-searching days of experimentation with mind-altering psychedelic drugs gave way to the rabid consumption of more aggressive drugs like cocaine, and the unapologetic greed of the Reagan Era was right around the corner.Let's take a closer look at this family that mirrors so many others.Captain Spaulding is strangely likable as the father. Angry, volatile, frightening, and oddly sexual, Spaulding no longer lives with his wife and children. He has moved on to another overly-ample woman, yet dreams of another woman altogether to satisfy his greed and selfishness. Estranged like so many millions of fathers, Spaulding often argues with his son, and would just as soon beat the tar out of him as die for him. And surely he knows he is going to die by the time he holes up with his brother, as he sucks down every iota of smoke from a joint, knowing it is likely his last. Indeed, he had to know all along that his actions would ultimately lead to his doom; as we all know that the more we consume, the more we plunder our land and our own people, the sooner our own end will come.Baby Firefly, ostensibly the youngest of the clan, does not represent innocence lost so much as innocence never possessed. She is acutely aware of her sadistic nature, as well as her sexual appeal (which she uses to lure her male victims into her world); so much so that she brags about her abilities to one of her victims. ""It's all mind power,"" Baby says, casually brandishing a massive knife. She is the surface beauty of America to which we all so desperately cling. A beauty that maintains its incalescence even as it violently lashes out at any perceived threat. Her mother calls her an Angel, and she certainly is a creature only a mother could love; just as America has become a country only an American could love.Otis, the fifteen to forty-something son, is the lost and wandering soul of all Americans. Abandoned to a violent, insane world with no place for him, he lashes back out at the world in the only way he can... with violence and insanity. Lean, mean, unapologetic, Otis too is aware of his fate. When one of his victims hopelessly asks, ""What now?"", Otis simply replies, ""It's the end of the road."" Even his beard tells a tale, each crystal-clear bristle a testament to a man old before his time.Every character here tells a tale. Sheriff Wydell is authority out of control, tracking down and torturing the Fireflys to satisfy his own ends. Tiny is the ugly secret that every family hides. This truly is America: a crazy hodge-podge of different people and ideas; its greatest strength and perhaps its greatest weakness.So why does THE DEVIL'S REJECTS make me angry? Because it's so damned good at what it does. Not only is it a kick-ass action/horror film that makes me think; but its metaphors are all the more relevant today, as America slides further and further to the dark side. And what better way for Rob Zombie to get his point across than with a hyper-violent, retro horror film peopled with actors that are so perfectly fringe, so damned cool, as to make Tarantino salivate? The news media certainly doesn't cover dissenting opinions of late; and that onetime outlet for protest, Rock and Roll, has certainly seen better days. It's a different world. Hip-Hop is the new protest music. Extreme Cinema is the new Rock and Roll; Tarantino, Zombie and Miike the new rock stars; ICHI THE KILLER and Captain Spaulding the new superheroes. And it makes sense, that in our over- stimulated, hyper-fast society the only way to get people's attention is to be more crazy, more violent, more obscene that the last guy.So watch THE DEVIL'S REJECTS. Watch THE DEVIL'S REJECTS and get angry.And rock on.",The Devil's Rejects

The Devil's Rejects is a most appropriate name as these people are so vile and disturbing, that even the devil himself would find cause to repel them. The best thing about these movies was the soundtrack. Not only are the songs great, but they are heightened even further by their use at perfect times in the movie.

And, even though the ""family"" are blood thirsty and heartless killers, you almost feel sorry for them at the end when they are killed. That is how well written and directed this movie is. Rob Zombie is the best directer ever. The beginning of the movie opens so well with the newspaper clippings showing what the family is into with the murders and all. This movie flows very well from one scene to the next. Another thing is the way the family is close to each other. The brother, Otis, and the sister, Baby, are very close to each other as well as the other brother and the mother. I haven't seen a movie that makes you feel so close to the characters as much as this one does. There is no question, this is the best movie ever.
