0,MartinHafer,"for the genre, it's awfully good",7,29 March 2006,"The 1980s saw a proliferation of ""teen movies"". About 90% of them had nothing new to really say, starred teen ""heart throbs"" and were marketed ONLY to younger, dumber audiences. I was in my teens and twenties in this era, but even I thought these movies were awful==obviously I was the correct age but just ""didn't get it"". Uh, huh.Many of these movies featured crude and dumb humor, ample boobies (which is odd, considering the audience technically was too young to be admitted to many of these dreadful films) and low production values. As I said before, the movies seemed to be marketed to dumb people. Don't believe me?! Well think back to such films as the PORKY'S movies, Freddy Kruger films, HALLOWEEN, the later ROCKY films, etc. These films truly were awful.So, with all this dreck, it was nice to see a few teen-oriented films that didn't insult the audience or feature mind-rot. ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING (as well as films such as BETTER OFF DEAD) was a decent film that actually had something to say to teens--and it could be enjoyed by adults as well (what a concept). While the story does have its sexy jokes, teens who know more than adults and silly escapades, it manages some originality and some genuine laughs. It's cute how an innocent little trek into the city results in a long series of unbelievable and dangerous consequences--many of which are quite funny. Give it a try--it's not ""rocket science"" or Masterpiece Theatre, but it's good old fashioned silly fun.PS--watch ALL the movie--including the very end. Many times on TV they cut off the very end, but on video or DVD it's there. So, DON'T turn it off when the credits roll.",Adventures in Babysitting
1,bkoganbing,A Murphy's Law Film,6,9 December 2011,"When Elizabeth Shue took that baby sitting gig for the night with Keith Coogan and little sister Maia Brewton it seemed like easy money. But then she gets a call from her good friend Penelope Ann Miller who has run away from home and is stuck penniless in the Chicago bus terminal. Not to worry, but Elizabeth takes the family car of the parents she's babysitting for and the kids along with her to perform a mission of mercy. Another friend of Coogan's, Andrew Rapp a kid with some raging hormones invites himself along for the ride and before long all of them have a night's worth of Adventures In Babysitting.It's amazing the number of situations that this group can get into. Adventures In Babysitting is one of those Murphy's Law films in that everything that can possibly go wrong, does go wrong. This group gets in and out of trouble with such ease and aplomb that you kind of hope the film goes on a bit more. Probably just as well it didn't because it would get a bit much.I was really shocked at learning that 'Thor' was played by a young Vincent D'Onofrio. I've seen him in other things besides Criminal Intent, but this small part at the beginning of his career was a revelation.Calvin Levels who plays a street smart urban youth who's into carjacking should also get singled out for recognition. He feels kind of sorry for these fish out of their own comfort pond and tries to help them as best he can.Adventures In Babysitting is a pretty funny teen comedy and definitely a Blockbuster Night's entertainment.",Adventures in Babysitting
2,Leofwine_draca,Didn't care for this one,4,7 April 2016,"I quite like '80s US comedies as a whole but ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING left me cold. It's a little too kid-focused, for me, and the character that Elizabeth Shue plays is rather irritating throughout. While it's nice to see a movie that encapsulates plenty of popular culture from the era, the resultant adventure is rather silly and the direction from Chris Columbus more than a little lacking.In essence, a novice babysitter takes her various charges and goes on an adventure in downtown Chicago. The group get involved with various criminal types as well as various blossoming romances and the like, and there are nice supporting roles for actors like John Davis Chandler. Overall, though, this is supposed to be a comedy, and I'm afraid there was very little here that I laughed at.",Adventures in Babysitting
3,SnoopyStyle,Harmless adventure,6,28 January 2015,"Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue)'s big anniversary date gets canceled at the last minute by boyfriend Mike (Bradley Whitford). With nothing to do, she goes to babysit Thor obsessed little Sara Anderson (Maia Brewton). Her geeky brother Brad (Keith Coogan) is in love with Chris. His nerd friend Daryl Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp) comes over. Chris' friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) tried to run away from home and is left penniless in downtown Chicago. Chris drives downtown and is forced to take along the three kids. She gets a flat tire and the adventures in babysitting begin.This is a second rate John Hughes wannabe movie. There's even a musical interlude although it's not really done right. It has the distinction of being Chris Columbus' first directing effort who would also direct similar movies like Home Alone. Elisabeth Shue is likable enough but she's not really America's sweetheart type. She's into her 20s by then and a bit too old to play a teen. It's basically a harmless kid movie playing up the suburb downtown divide. Shue is kind of broad with her naivety but there are a few chuckles.",Adventures in Babysitting
4,claudio_carvalho,A Cult-Movie for the Entire Life,9,18 November 2014,"In the suburbs of Chicago, the seventeen year-old Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) is in love with her boyfriend Mike (Bradley Whitford). When Mike stands her up and cancels their dinner in Chicago, Chris accepts to babysit the siblings Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan). But her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) calls her telling that she decided to run away home but now she has repented; she begs Chris to rescue her from the bus station in downtown Chicago. Chris makes a deal with Sara and Brad and when she is ready to drive to downtown, Brad's friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) overhears the negotiation and blackmails Chris to go with them. However, when they are on the expressway, Chris has a flat tire and she realizes that she has forgotten her purse in the house. The mechanic Pruitt (John Ford Noonan) stops this tow truck and offers to truck the car to his garage. Chris sees no other option and accepts the offer in the beginning of an unforgettable night of adventures in Chicago.""Adventures in Babysitting"" is one of those adorable cult-movies for the entire life. I saw this movie in the 80's and since then, it has become one of my top movies ever. There are unforgettable scenes and maybe my favorite is when Albert Collins says that nobody leaves the club without singing a blues. The 25th anniversary Blu-Ray is really a worthwhile shopping. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Uma Noite de Aventuras"" (""One Night of Adventures"")Note: On 16 April 2019, I saw this film again.",Adventures in Babysitting
5,gavin6942,The Peak of the 1980s,8,24 June 2014,"Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) agrees to babysit after her date stands her up. Expecting a dull evening, Chris settles down with three kids for a night of TV... and boredom. But when her frantic friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) calls and pleads to be rescued from the bus station in downtown Chicago, the evening soon explodes into an endless whirl of hair-raising adventures! For whatever reason, this film is rated relatively low, even below the disappointing ""Pretty in Pink"" (easily the worst Hughes-related film). Why? This marks the pinnacle of 1980s coming-of-age films, with a plot similar to (yet completely different from) ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".How can anyone watch this and not think it was the best 90 minutes they can recall in recent memory?",Adventures in Babysitting
6,lee_eisenberg,the revenge of both the baby-sat and babysitter,5,17 April 2006,"""Adventures in Babysitting"" is sort of ridiculous - maybe completely hokey - but harmless nonetheless. For the most part, this is one of those teen movies that they cranked out in the '80s. It has Chicago teenager Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) babysitting for some people, but a series of events lead her and the children on a wild goose chase all over the Windy City. I really liked the scene on the metro, and also the scene in the office building. Nothing special, but good for a few laughs.Who ever would have guessed that the director behind this would later helm the ""Harry Potter"" movies?",Adventures in Babysitting
7,Woodyanders,An immensely enjoyable 80's teen comedy blast,8,6 May 2010,"Sweet, perky, and resourceful 17-year-old babysitter Chris Parker (a wonderfully chipper and vivacious performance by Elisabeth Shue in her first lead role) and the three kids she's taking care of -- smitten Brad Anderson (likable Keith Coogan), Brad's perky little sister Sara (adorable Maia Brewton), and Brad's crude buddy Daryl Coopersmith (hilarious Anthony Rapp) -- are forced to venture into the dark and dangerous downtown section of Chicago to pick up Chris's gal pal Brenda (an amusingly ditsy Penelope Ann Miller) at the bus stop. The hapless quartet blow out a car tire, run afoul of an international stolen car ring, stumble into an all-black blues club where they are forced to belt out a nifty ditty called ""Babysittin' Blues"" (a truly great sequence), crash a frat party, and even have a scary run-in with two rival street gangs on the subway. Director Chris Columbus, working from a bright and eventful script by David Simkins, relates the busy narrative at a constant brisk pace, maintains an amiable tone throughout, and gives the picture a winningly breezy and inoffensive quality that's impossible to either resist or dislike. But it's the marvelously vibrant and endearing presence of the lovely and appealing Shue that really makes this movie hum; she's such an incredibly charming lady, with oodles of natural charisma and energy, that you can't help but root for her all the way. The lively acting from the rest of the tip-top cast helps matters out a whole lot, with especially stand-out contributions by Calvin Levels as nice guy car thief Joe Gipp, George Newbern as affable college student Dan Lynch, John Davis Chandler as creepy stolen car ring head honcho Bleak, Vincent D'Onofrio as menacing mechanic Dawson, and John Ford Noonan as helpful hook-handed tow truck driver Handsome John Pruitt. Ric Waite's slick cinematography makes the Windy City locations look suitably grimy and frightening. Kudos are also in order for Michael Kamen's frantic score and the bang-up soundtrack of get-down funky blues and R&B songs. A hugely entertaining film.",Adventures in Babysitting
8,Tweekums,Fun '80s teen comedy adventure,8,21 July 2012,"Chris Parker is expecting to have a great night out with her boyfriend but things don't go according to plan; first he cancels, telling her that his little sister is ill and he must look after her; then she is asked to babysit eight year old Sara and her fifteen year old brother Brad. She hasn't been there long when she gets a desperate phone call from her friend Brenda who ran away from home and is now in the city bus station without any money. Chris can't not help her friend nor can she leave the children alone so they all head into Chicago along with Brad's friend Daryl. It should be a simple thing to do but everything that can go wrong does; they have a blowout, the car has no spare tyre and Chris forgot her purse; this leads to a run in with a hook-handed tow truck driver, a car thief, a group of mobsters and a couple of gangs! Before the film is over they will almost get shot, walk across a high girder, crash a frat party, crash the party attended by Sara's parents and Sara will end up stuck on the outside of a skyscraper!This film is a lot of fun with laughs from start to finish; the situations are obviously over the top but it should be easy enough to suspend ones disbelief and enjoy the adventure. Elisabeth Shue does a fine job as Chris although young Maia Brewton, who plays Sara, steals just about every scene she is in; no matter how scary the situation she acts like it is part of a fun adventure; more importantly she isn't one of those annoyingly precocious child characters. While they get in numerous dangerous situations there is never a feeling that any of them might get hurt so it shouldn't scare younger viewers... although I suppose some parents might not approve of the running gag concerning Chris being mistaken for the current Playboy centrefold! This actually turns out to be a key plot point when one of the boys steals a copy belonging to a mobster who has written incriminating details in it. Plenty of good teen comedies were churned out in the eighties and nineties and while this isn't one of the best known ones it is certainly well worth watching if it is on television.",Adventures in Babysitting
9,Hey_Sweden,"""Tonight is going to be the greatest night of your life.""",8,7 January 2013,"""Adventures in Babysitting"" is a solidly entertaining ""everything that can go wrong will go wrong"" farce that doesn't necessarily appeal to just kids. In fact, it's a little more intense than some people might expect. It marked the transition of screenwriter Chris Columbus (""Gremlins"", ""Young Sherlock Holmes"") into directing, and stars an incredibly appealing Elisabeth Shue as Chris, a high school senior who, unable to go on a date with her boyfriend (Bradley Whitford), reluctantly agrees to take a babysitting gig, even as she feels she's getting a little old for that sort of thing. Her charge is young Sara (Maia Brewton), a kid with a fixation on comic book character Thor, and the girl's older brother is Brad (Keith Coogan), who's got something of a crush on Chris. Chris expects a rather quiet night, but is pulled into one nightmare after another when she decides to come to the aid of her desperate friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller). She, Sara, and Brad, along with Brad's obnoxious buddy Daryl (Anthony Rapp), end up pursued by psychotic criminals (led by a genuinely spooky John Davis Chandler), caught up in a gang fight, spending time at a frat party, taken for a ride by a crazed tow truck driver (John Ford Noonan), and coming dangerously close to being discovered by Sara's and Brad's parents. The good thing is just how well all of this flows - even at an hour and 43 minutes, there's no filler, just a wild story that moves from one episode to another. The true key to its success is how engaging the cast is, though. Shue does well in her first starring role, Brewton is cute, Coogan is likable, and Rapp is frequently hilarious even if playing kind of a clichéd role. The film also works as a collection of talented actors near the beginning of their careers: in addition to Miller, who has her own night of horrors while waiting at the bus station, and Whitford, there's Calvin Levels as helpful car thief Joe Gipp, Vincent D'Onofrio as muscular garage mechanic Dawson, George Newbern as nice guy college student Dan, Lolita Davidovich as an air headed gal at the party, and Clark Johnson as a gang leader. The show stopping scene of course is the one where blues master Albert Collins, in a special appearance, won't let Chris and company leave his stage without singing the blues, and they belt out a ditty about their babysitting woes. (Southside Johnny also puts in an appearance as well.) This movie is certainly never boring, delivering some good laughs and keeping up a high energy level right up to its feel-good ending. Recommended. Eight out of 10.",Adventures in Babysitting
10,preppy-3,A big guilty favorite!,8,18 September 2000,"A babysitter (Elisabeth Shue who's just fantastic) has 2 kids to take care of (and another kid who pops in). Then she gets a call from her best friend who's stranded in Chicago and needs a ride home. She goes to pick her up, with the 3 kids, and gets involved in some wild (and totally improbable) adventures while trying to find her friend.OK, this isn't a good movie--the plot is ridiculous, the kids act like adults (and vice versa) and most of the humor is pretty sophomoric. But, I love it! I laugh out loud at all the stupid jokes and find the film fast-paced and engaging. Also good use of music, beautiful shots of Chicago at night and good performances by everybody (especially Shue). Is this a good movie? No. Is it fun? Very! Well worth catching.""Don't f**k with the babysitter!""",Adventures in Babysitting
11,utgard14,"""I don't think your parents will ever ask me to babysit again.""",8,13 April 2014,"When she receives a frantic phone call from her friend who is stuck in downtown Chicago at night, suburban babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue) must head to the big city to help. But she can't leave the kids she's babysitting so she brings them along. The night becomes one big crazy experience for Chris and the kids. Classic '80s greatness here. You take a situation that, in reality, might wind up with a bunch of young people on the evening news as rape and/or murder victims and you turn it into an adventurous lark. Love the '80s!This is a highly entertaining movie. The characters are fun and well-written. The dialogue is great. It has the feel of a John Hughes movie. Elisabeth Shue is so good in this. It's impossible not to have a crush on her after watching this film. The kids are all good, with Maia Brewton stealing practically every scene she's in. Her love of Thor was a big kick to me as a kid since I was also a big fan of Thor and all the other kids I knew had no clue who he was. The scene where she meets ""Thor"" for real is one of the many highlights of this film for me. Just a great movie from a great decade. You should definitely check it out.",Adventures in Babysitting
12,Boba_Fett1138,Fun light entertainment.,7,21 February 2008,"The movie its strongest point is its fun adventurous way of storytelling. It makes the whole story and movie seem like one big adventure, set in a big city. The roll from the one fun and of course highly unlikely situation into the other. It makes the movie very entertaining to watch and also fairly unpredictable, in terms of you not knowing what will happen to the main characters next.The movie is filled with a couple of greatly fun moments but of course also some moments that don't work out. Luckily every moment in the movie is not really long enough to bore you when you don't really like it. The movie shouldn't had been much longer though. It all became a bit tiresome after a while and I feel the movie won't had been as effective had it lasted 2 hours.Also a great asset from the movie is its cast and especially the kid roles within the movie. Normally kid actors aren't among the most believable once in the business, especially not in these type of films but all of the actors here do a great job and they most importantly all have some great chemistry together. Also Elisabeth Shue handles her role well. It was one of her first leading roles out of her career, even before her Back to the Future film roles. Also Penelope Ann Miller shows up in a fun and early movie role.It's a sort of a shame that this Chris Columbus movie is relatively unknown. It by the way also was his directorial debut and what a fine way to start of his directing career it was!I think especially the kids will appreciate this movie and its fun adventurous way of storytelling, even though the movie is rated PG-13.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Adventures in Babysitting
13,view_and_review,Suburban Nightmares of the City,5,1 September 2019,"This movie was so much better when I was a kid.The ""adventures"" in babysitting were all sparked by the babysitter's irresponsible friend. You see, Sara (Elisabeth Shue) was supposed to have a quiet night of babysitting in the suburbs of Chicago. Maybe she would have to ward off a pesky younger admirer but nothing she couldn't handle. Then Sara's best friend, Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), decides to run away from home with no money. So what does she do? Calls Sara to come pick her up from the dangerous downtown bus station ASAP.That's when the ""adventures"" began. These ""adventures"" are nothing more than the hallucinations of preppy sheltered kids, or the tall-tales suburb parents tell their kids to keep them away from the ""city.""The moment the sweet angelic babysitter and the three kids left the confines of their cozy suburb bubble they ran into problems. Because the city is nothing but problems: bad roads, unclean people, homelessness, crime, crazies and wackos. Sure, it was all shown in a humorous manner; we were supposed to laugh at it all, and I thought it was hilarious as a kid. I couldn't wait to have those adventures myself.Then I grew up. And I'm always in the city. Not Chicago, but it doesn't matter. The ""adventures"" they had were actually kinda wack. The goal was to ""survive,"" pick up Brenda, and get home before the parents did. The first goal makes sense. The second goal was meh. If they ""rescued"" her from the bus station or didn't rescue her it was her own fault. I say let her spend a night in a dirty bus station, that's what you get for running away. The last goal was just for added drama because we know that nothing really happens to these kids anyway. I mean really. If the parents got home and found out the kids had this ""adventure"" there'd be no dessert for a week and they would've fired Chris as a babysitter, which would've been doing her a favor.There never were ""adventures."" None of that ever happened. That's what spoiled rich suburbanites think happens if their precious sprouts were to dare venture into the city.",Adventures in Babysitting
14,Wuchakk,Survival in the city,8,16 February 2018,"RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Chris Columbus, ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (aka ""A Night on the Town"") is a teen dramedy about 17 year-old babysitter, Chris (Elisabeth Shue), from the suburbs of Chicago who has no choice but to take the siblings she's babysitting (Keith Coogan & Maia Brewton) and their friend (Anthony Rapp) into the big city whereupon they have many misadventures. Penelope Ann Miller plays Chris' geeky friend (at the bus station), Calvin Levels a car thief, John Davis Chandler the main heavy and George Newbern a helpful college dude with eyes for Chris. I was surprised at how entertaining this movie is. It has the tone of an Indiana Jones flick, but with teen protagonists and taking place in a modern USA city. The Thor element was a unique surprise and the little girl is cute and spry. The protagonists are likable and you can sense the warmth in their relationships, e.g. Brad's infatuation with Chris. Unfortunately, the movie fumbles the ball on the female front a little bit. There are quality women in the cast, for sure, but the director never milks these resources for their worth (and I'm not tawkin' bout nudity or sleaze). Take Shue, for example (who was 21 during filming); she's dressed in a looong sweater or jacket that covers her figure the entire film. Compare this with her role in ""The Karate Kid"" (1984) where her beauty is well displayed and tastefully so. THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 42 minutes and was shot in Toronto and the Chicago area.

15,Mr-Fusion,Hard to believe John Hughes had nothing to do with this,7,4 August 2016,"This is a really lazy claim to make, but they really don't make kids movies anymore like ""Adventures in Babysitting"". Some of the dialogue is unexpectedly adult (modern fare admittedly sets that bar pretty low), and I think it still stands today as a prime example of the Big Bad City. But it's also easy to expect overhearing sentiment and tacky plot twists in a movie like this, and the script largely avoids that. I've got respect for that, and this makes for a surprisingly watchable movie. It's a pretty good adventure into the dark and scary, and having the pretty Elizabeth Shue at the forefront helps immensely (not to mention having the world's nicest carjacker along for the ride).Good stuff.7/10",Adventures in Babysitting
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,"One of those movies you grow out of, but don't stop liking",7,28 November 2003,"I grew up with this movie and always wanted to be like Chris. She was so beautiful and handled the toughest situations so well. She took the deadliest situations and got the kids out of them so safely. Well, now I babysit and I'm glad I never got in the same situation, but it still made for a great and fun movie.Chris is a senior who has a big date planned with her boyfriend, but when he cancels, she is forced to babysit the Anderson's daughter, Sara. They also have a son, Brad is a couple years younger and has a huge crush on Chris and decides to cancel on his friend, Darrel to stay home with Chris. But when Chris's best friend, Brenda, calls her from the Anderson's, she finds out her friend is stranded at a bus station and can't get anyone else to help her. So Chris takes Brad and Sara and is forced to take Darrel since he won't leave them alone, they all go into the city of Chicago and end up getting a flat and get into one deadly situation after the next, even getting chased by the Mafia! This is a fun flick that I still watch 'til this day and have so much fun with. I would always recommend this also for anyone, I truly hope it is discovered by new generations. I still enjoy singing along with the ""Babysitting Blues"", I think I finally feel Chris's pain, after all, I'm too old to babysit. :D 7/10",Adventures in Babysitting
17,bowmanblue,Classic timeless eighties comedy,9,15 July 2020,"I know it's a cliche to say 'They don't make 'em like they used to,' but, in the case of 'Adventures in Babysitting,' I think it's pretty true. It's one of those eighties film that seemed to get everything so right that the story didn't need to spend half of the film on 'back story' or giving the characters loads of screentime in order for us to get to know them. Instead, it kicks off within the first ten minutes.A seventeen-year-old girl, Chris Parker (a rather young Elizabeth Shue), gets her plans with her boyfriend cancelled and is forced to babysit a local girl, Sara (and her fifteen-year-old brother, Brad, who has a major crush on Chris). However, if that wasn't bad enough, Chris' best friend, Brenda, gets stranded in the big city and Chris has to take the kids (and Brad's best friend, Daryl, who both figuratively and literally has a big mouth!).Within the opening fifteen minutes all the major characters have been introduced. We - the audience - will have sympathy for Chris and (hopefully!) won't find the kids annoying in any way, as they're all presented very well. Naturally, Chris' 'rescue of Brenda doesn't go according to plan and they all get stranded on the freeway. Between there and the end of the film they get into gang fights, car crime, hook-handed mechanics and hanging off skyscrapers.There may be nothing too new about the story, but it's simply so much fun I think most people should be able to overlook any minor cliche and suspend their disbelief simply to get a decent amount of entertainment out of it. All the performances are great and the main four characters play off each other so well that you can't help but remember them.It's hard to put 'Adventures in Babysitting' into a genre. It has elements of thriller, comedy, crime, romance, but is generally one of those eighties films which is so timeless that it can probably appeal to all the family. Yes, there are a couple of 'f-bombs' thrown in there during one segment, but, apart from that, I reckon most people should be able to sit down and enjoy everything this has to offer. It's not an overly-long film and no part feels drawn out or a waste of time. I hope this film never gets a remake, but if it does - it has to at least have a cameo from Chris Hemsworth - if you've watched the film you'll know what I mean!",Adventures in Babysitting
18,CuriosityKilledShawn,The correct way to sit on a baby.,7,2 October 2012,"Adventures in Babysitting is one of those movies that all of the kids back in the day saw apart from me. No particular reason, I just never got around to it. With the new Blu-ray I figured now would be right time to catch up on what I missed.It's not a John Hughes movie, but it does have a similar aesthetic and is set in a cold, snowy Chicago (a common Hughes theme), and it's the director debut of Chris Columbus who worked with Hughes on the first two Home Alone movies. Babysitting is quite similar in that is has a bunch of kids/teens getting into all kinds of hi-jinks while evading and outsmarting crooked grown-ups.Elizabeth Shue plays Chris Parker (no relation to Jennifer Parker from BTTF) a girl who has been stood-up by her sleazeball boyfriend and ends up babysitting for a wealthy couple while they go hob-nobbing in the city. Though content to sit in the house all night she gets a frantic call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who is trapped in an inner city bus station and needs rescued. Multiple detours and deviations make the rescue no easy task. I guess in this sense the movie feels a little bit like Planes, Trains and Automobiles.It's all inoffensive and good-natured, though I was surprised to hear a couple of F-bombs in there, and some of the dialogue is a little raunchy. Babysitting is no classic, but has lasting appeal and is a fun ride. Michael Kamen also provides a score which sounds like a Die Hard prototype, lending a little more weight to the adventure than would be typical. Stay watching until after the credits for an extra scene.",Adventures in Babysitting
19,johnnyboyz,Ends up as a bit of a mis-adventure for the audience but there is some fun to had out of the film.,5,26 February 2008,"The opening scene of Adventures in Babysitting (curiously re-titled A Night on the Town for British audiences) has Elizabeth Shue's character Chris Parker dancing to an old record from the 1960s, as she gears up for a romantic evening out with a partner. It is a scene that perfectly sets the tone for the film: wacky titles, upbeat and likable song, fast edits and happy people dancing as they prepare to be with the one they love. It is a scene that not only sets up the tone of the film but it is also a scene that will come and go; a scene that the film will not revisit or so-much as even reference later on since just minutes later, Chris' bubble will be burst and she will be off down a different path.Such is the cut and thrust nature of films that rely on cause and effect as their narrative base, it is very rare for a film to refer back to a scene from ten minutes ago because something so drastic would have happened to propel the story into its next situation. I hate to refer to films made since the one I'm talking about but 2005 film Cellular is a good example of a film that presents us with one situation the hero must overcome, before leading into another and then another  all the time not looking back; the closing half an hour of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is another good example. But then again, I'm a big fan of those two films and whilst Adventures in Babysitting is good fun; it does not hold up as a film nor as a realistic piece of entertainment.The most frustrating thing that glares the most out of the film, for me anyway, were the inconsistencies apparent within the character of Sara Anderson (Brewton) who is the youngest member of the family being babysat at eight years old; she is also the smartest and there's your problem. Unfortunately, most of the logic in this film is replaced for good excuses to try and get laughs out of the audience. Sara is smart enough to have the dialogue to make us think she is clever but is actually foolish enough to climb out of a window on the fortieth floor of a skyscraper; her imperative inclusion to the story is once again utilised as she is able to overcome the plot point that involves being able to turn a money grabbing mechanic into a good Samaritan; this time through innocence. The third example of Sara's inability to be an 8 year old human being, or indeed the writer's inability to create an 8 year old human being is when, shortly after they have been caught carjacking by a carjacker and are hurtling along to a gangster's warehouse, Sara pulls out a chocolate bar and finds it in her heart to offer some to all in the car  she is not terrified like her brother, his friend and Elizabeth are even if she should be the most terrified.But then we have to suspend belief to go along with the film's running gag; that these incompetent human beings can get their way out of any jam, no matter how difficult. Elizabeth is a 17 year old babysitter who has jeopardised everyone's situation at the expense of a friend although you cannot blame her; Brad, 15 (Coogan) is a kid who is attracted to Elizabeth and his friend Daryl (Rapp) who is equally sexually active, at least in his own mind and enough to want Elizabeth to rape him. But while these kids can get out of jams such as escaping a building full of gangsters who will no doubt kill them in due course, the film does not elevate itself above that level of: 'here comes the situation, here is the situation, there goes the situation' which is disappointing as there is a certain likability for all of the characters involved. Daryl may think with a body part that is not his brain on more than one occasion but he carries a degree of innocence that just keeps him from being another one of these American teenagers obsessed with women; something that does not work AS a character, IN a film.But whilst the characters remain inconsistent and the plot remains basic, the actual cause and effect situations are nothing that special either. The carjacker does not have time to deliver the kids somewhere safe before driving on; the kids actually stop half way through their escape from certain death by singing 'the blues' in a music club and they even find time to go to a student party during the course of their adventure. It's not that these events aren't interesting, they are just too unrealistic and heavy handed to warrant good viewing. If your idea of comedy and tension is to have the kids actually stop and sing to a crowd of blues fans, this is the film for you; otherwise I am surprised they did not merely barge through the barrier and continue to escape  maybe they could've even asked for help from the musicians as they outrun the murderous gangsters.But whilst incompetence would have them go on this adventure in the first place as it is Brenda (Miller) who sparks the journey off, it is incompetence and inconsistency that actually gets them through the journey that matters. The bad guys nearer the end are not waiting for them in the garage despite having the address and would rather follow them to the third act setting than nab them there and then but glaring errors seem to be accepted by director Columbus, embraced even, as these people survive the city streets like cacti survive the blistering sun. It may not be smart nor that funny but the adventure is enjoyable in places, even if you need your brain suspended for the majority of the runtime.",Adventures in Babysitting

I enjoyed it when I saw it in the theater (Sunrise Multiplex, Valley Stream, NY) and I still enjoy it. Elisabeth Shue is very good. The rest of the cast does a nice job as well.

21,southdavid,Dub-misstep.,5,5 January 2021,"For whatever reason, ""Adventures in Babysitting"" passed me by in the 1980's, I feel like maybe they just didn't have the VHS at my local Co-op. So, appearing next on my alphabetical trawl through the Disney Plus archive, I've come across this hilariously butchered TV version, which although had some interesting cameos, is rather a dull affair, if it's not hitting you with a nostalgia buzz.Stood up by her boyfriend, Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) agrees to babysit for Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan). Not long after arriving she receives a call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who is stuck in the City after dark and unable to get home. Chris decides to take, Sara, Brad and Brad's friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) downtown to pick her up, but a flat tyre is only the first of a number of increasingly wild problems that will befall them.The overdubbing of some of the offensive words in the film is the most hilarious aspect about it. Thor is a . . . 'Weirdo' . . . that's definitely what he said. I quite liked Elisabeth Shue in this, as I do in most things, but I found the kids to be annoying, particularly Rapp's Daryl. The cameos from Bradley Whitford and Vincent D'Onofrio are retrospectively quite interesting, especially the long haired and muscular turn from VDO.I just didn't find a film that could keep my attention though. It's fantastical, as they blunder from organised crime ring, to college party, to inner city gang fight and it's not like I found the lack of plausibility to be a problem, it is supposed to be a comedy after all. Put simply, I didn't find it funny, or charming. I get that I might feel differently if I had grown up with the film, but I can't change that now and without that reminder of your youth it's a bland and humourless affair.",Adventures in Babysitting

I seen this about a month ago and I thought it was very good. Bradley Whitford plays Elizabeth Shue's boyfriend Mike who ditches her later on and the action sequences was very good. For Christopher Columbus's movie debut he did a good job as he would later create other films such as both Home Alone films,Mrs Doubtfire,Harry Potter & The Philosphers Stone and was also an executive producer for the Night At The Museum franchise. A couple of years later this film was remade starring Sofia Carlson as the main lead charcther that Shue played.See it !!!I would love to see this movie again soon.",Adventures in Babysitting

For example, in a scene in which a young girl confronts a surly mechanic (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), believing him to be the comic book superhero Thor, the scene doesn't work because nothing the character has shown us so far would make us believe that she could be so foolish.Characters change to meet the needs of the scenes. I guess they story boarded, came up with a bunch of different scenes, and just went from there.They also don't really create characters you care about. This could have been like an Eighties teen-version of Scorsese's ""After Hours"". It's a similar basic story: one person tries to hold things together while it goes from bad to worse.

Shue's idiot friend has a major emergency and needs her help in the big city. Shue takes the kids on a trip to help her friend. Overblown 80's-style scenarios happen; many of which are only amusing in the 80's context thus are still charming and amusing.

I thought that Daryl (Anthony Rapp) was absolutely annoying! You'd have to have seen this movie if you want to know why. Also, if you ask me, what Mike (Bradley Whitford) did to Chris (Elusabeth Shue) was absolutely cold! On the other hand, every mishap that occurred after Chris' car tire blew was absolutely hilarious. Also, what Chris did was absolutely brave, although Dan (George Newbern) was kind of creepy. If a friend of mine were in that kind of predicament, I'd probably do anything I could to help. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, and production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy about surviving on your own when you're a minor! I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",Adventures in Babysitting

30,PredragReviews,Why Didn't She Babysit Me?!,8,12 May 2016,"This is a perfect 80's movie. It fits right into the category that already includes the best of John Hughes' input (and what big 80's kid movie didn't he do?!) and a few others. One of the pluses is the cast. Shue is wonderful as Chris, a young girl who is trying desperately to save her friend and keep her young charges out of harm's way. The kids themselves are good. They may have some typical young kid annoyances, but they are all pretty good and make it feel like they are real kids who you actually like. Penelope Ann Miller is one of the best parts here. With her big glasses, nerdy appearance, and comical misadventures of her own in the bus terminal, she delivers many of the funniest moments.It's all inoffensive and good-natured, though I was surprised to hear a couple of F-bombs in there, and some of the dialogue is a little raunchy. Babysitting is no classic, but has lasting appeal and is a fun ride. Michael Kamen also provides a score which sounds like a ""Die Hard"" prototype, lending a little more weight to the adventure than would be typical. But overall, ""Adventures in Babysitting"" delivers real laughs while taking you on a wild ride through the wicked bowels of the city.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Adventures in Babysitting
31,johno-21,Guilty pleasure flick,7,12 June 2006,"I saw this on HBO or one of the movie channels when it first came to television and I knew nothing about and had never heard about. It's title sounded like a juvenile kids movie but I checked it out to see what it was about. I never expected to see more than a few minutes before I turned the channel but to my surprise I started liking it. It's a fast paced implausible story with a lot of adventure in it. A teenager on babysitting duty takes her charges and their neighbor friend from the suburbs to downtown Chicago to pick up her friend who's stranded at a bus depot. The simple plan soon goes awry and the adventures of their evening begin. Television writer David Simkins wrote the fun and imaginative script. In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus who would go on to direct the Home Alone and Harry Potter films as well as Mrs. Doubtfire, makes the leap from screenwriter of such films as Gremlins and Goonies to director. Elizabeth Shue in just her third film turns in a great comedic performance leading a cast of unknowns of which many would go on to successful film and television careers. Among the cast are Maia Brewton, Keith Coogan, Anthony Rapp, Penelope Ann Miller and Vincent D'Onofrio. Look for Lolita Davidovich, John Cusak and Andrew Shue in bit roles. Even the film's writer David Simkins shows up on screen. My favorite scene is with blues great Albert Collins when the kids get on stage in an uptown bar they have unknowingly fled into and are forced to improve a blues song so they break into Babysitter's Blues.

It doesn't score a lot of points in the reality department, but for old fashioned mindless fun, you can't beat it. There is one funny scene after another here, with the scene in the blues club being a definite standout.

39,jhaggardjr,This is one awesome movie!,10,8 September 2000,"""Adventures in Babysitting"" is a movie that I'll never forget. One of the reasons why this film is so memorable is because of the Chicago locations. For the past 25 years or so there have been lots of good movies shot in and around Chicago (as well as the suburbs) such as ""Risky Business"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""The Fugitive"" just to name a few. But ""Adventures in Babysitting"" is probably my favorite movie to be made in Chicago. I saw this movie when it first came out in the summer of 1987 (a year after ""Ferris Bueller"" which ""Adventures"" bares somewhat of a resemblence to) and while I was watching the film it felt to me like I was part of the adventure. Today, this is still a very entertaining picture, and a lot of fun. Elisabeth Shue is terrific in her first leading role as Chris Parker, a 17-year-old high school senior who prepares for a big date with her boyfriend at the beginning of the film. But he cancels the date, and since she's now free for the night, she's asked to babysit for the Anderson kids. She agrees. Once she gets over there, she gets a frantic phone call from her best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who's run away from home and is now stranded at a bus station in downtown Chicago. Terrified after witnessing a shooting, Brenda asks Chris to pick her up because she blew all her money on the cab ride to the bus station. Hesitant, Chris has no choice but to take the two Anderson kids Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan) with her to pick up poor Brenda. Also going along for the ride, Brad's horny best friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp). Once they get on the expressway, things start to go wrong. Very wrong. This is where ""Adventures in Babysitting"" turns into a fun movie. The foursome experience car troubles; run-ins with a friendly car thief, a mob group the thief works for (who spend most of the movie chasing the kids through the streets of Chicago), and two gangs on a train; a short trip to a hospital (when one of the kids is slightly injured by a member of one of those gangs); a brief stop at a frat party; a chase to the top of a high-rise building; and a show stopping classic scene in a blues bar. And much more happens as the hapless Brenda continues to wait and wait and wait for Chris to come get her. ""Adventures in Babysitting"" was directed by Chris Columbus in his directing debut after writing screenplays for a couple of Steven Spielberg produced movies (""Gremlins"", ""The Goonies"", and ""Young Sherlock Holmes""). Since this film, Columbus has gone on to direct some of the biggest box office hit comedies of all-time such as ""Home Alone"", ""Home Alone 2"", and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". ""Adventures in Babysitting"" was nowhere near as big a hit as those films, but it did modestly well. I would have loved to see a sequel to this. It would have been interesting to see what kind of misadventures were next for Chris and company. Shue, Brewton, Coogan, and Rapp all seem to be having a blast on screen, and I would too if I were up their on the screen. Even though Miller doesn't seem to be having a good time, she's a scream as Brenda (she would later show off some real good acting in ""Kindergarten Cop"" and ""Awakenings""). And Vincent D'Onofrio (of ""Men in Black"" and currently ""The Cell"") has one of his first film roles in a very small part as the owner of a auto repair shop (where the broken down car gets fixed). ""Adventures in Babysitting"" is a movie that's great fun from start to finish and never lets up. This comedy/adventure is awesome!**** (out of four)",Adventures in Babysitting
40,DavidSim240183,Not quite the cult item often implied. More a diverting curio,7,29 June 2007,"Before Chris Columbus hit pay-dirt with Home Alone, he made a couple of lightweight comedies in the 80s. Adventures in Babysitting (or A Night On the Town as its known over here in the UK) was his directorial debut. Its not quite as polished as Home Alone, more like its Home Alone in an earlier, less developed form. But its not without real charm, and is even in some ways quite daring too.Its interesting to note that Chris Columbus would later collaborate with that king of the teen movies John Hughes, the man who redefined what films about teenagers could be all about. But Adventures in Babysitting was made without Hughes' involvement, and perhaps Columbus was trying to carve out a similar niche for himself.AIB is nowhere near as astute as Hughes' best work, even if Columbus has obviously been inspired by it. After all its set in Chicago, a place that has somehow inherited the mantle of teen capital of the world. And its a film that reminds considerably of Hughes' wonderfully spirited Ferris Bueller's Day Off, made the previous year.AIB doesn't match up to that superior film. In fact, a part of me wishes it had been directed by John Hughes. You can just imagine what he would have done with such a fascinating situation. Four suburban kids get hopelessly lost in downtown Chicago in the middle of the night. Hughes could have injected a real anarchic charge to the plot. But under Columbus' hand, AIB only emerges as likable fare when he could have had something really special here.Like I said though, its not a lost cause. It has some very entertaining moments. And the young cast are anything if not engaging. Elisabeth Shue, then only 24 and in her first starring role gives a very accomplished performance as Chris Parker, the babysitter forced to shepherd three kids while stranded on the inner city streets of Chicago.The film follows utterly formulaic routes, such as a steady stream of incidents and near disasters, but Shue's increasingly exasperated facial expressions are a joy. And she faints well too!Filling out the roles of her charges are Keith Coogan as Brad Anderson, Maia Brewton as his sister Sara, and the friend of the family who's tagged along, Anthony Rapp as Daryl Coopersmith.And they all give very gracious performances. Brad is endearingly dopey, and his unrequited crush on Chris is touching. Daryl's the smart alec who's curse is to see every situation as it actually is. But the shining light of the whole movie is 10 year old Maia Brewton as the Thor obsessed Sara. Her wide-eyed expressions are wonderfully charming. She has real magnetism as a young performer. And I love the part when she mistakes a mechanic for her idol Thor.The film's way of getting the kids into the city is quite slim. Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), a friend of Chris's runs away from home and gets as far as a bus station before losing her bottle. Now she needs Chris to pick her up. Its pretty shallow motivation when examined closely. In fact, Miller's character doesn't get that much to do. She simply has to put up with vagrants, thieves and rats until Chris shows. Its a thankless role, but Miller approaches it with enthusiasm nonetheless.When looking at the kids misadventures in the city, Columbus deserves to be commended for trying out such a potentially offensive situation. But the film is still not as edgy as it could have been.There are times when it comes close to achieving real brilliance. There is one truly inspired scene when the kids end up in a blues club, and are forced to sing. The song they come up with, the 'Babysitting Blues' where Chris bemoans her bad luck is a scene that's downright hilarious. Its the one scene in the whole film where Columbus seems to realise the potential of the material. In fact its a scene that wouldn't have looked out of place in a John Hughes film. The one moment that stays in your memory long after the rest of the film has faded.But nowhere else is there the same invention. There are some moments that are quite daring like an encounter with rival street gangs fighting for turf. Daryl chatting up a prostitute. Ominous city streets filled with shootists and hook-handed tow-truck drivers. But it never pushes the envelope quite far enough. And then when it comes to the momentum that drives the film's dynamic, in this case a group of chop shop dealers after a work order the kids have inadvertently stolen, that seems slim motivation too. You can see some of the plot points here Columbus would explore in greater detail in Home Alone.And some scenes are borderline ludicrous. Sara trapped on the outside of a skyscraper is just too ridiculous. You can tell Columbus was running out of ideas at this late stage in the film. In fact all the scenes in the skyscraper are pointless and utterly unfocused.But still, Adventures in Babysitting is much too likable a film to be easily dismissed. Its just that it could have been so much more. Its only a diverting escalation of bad events when it could have been a blackly funny, even revolutionary teen movie.",Adventures in Babysitting

The basic idea is to take an unsuspecting fairly well to do character (gender is almost not important) and whisk him/her/them away from their comfort zone. The general usage of the night is common in this sub genre. Well in this case we've got the very lovely Elisabeth Shue as a babysitter with three younger kids tagging along from the suburbs into the heart of the city's night life.So the starting point is not an original one, and neither is the plot. But Chris Columbus does what he knows best, he speeds up the story and extract every bit of charm his young stars have. And since they do have loads of charm, and Elisabeth Shue rarely looked better , it does work. Most of the characters are very undeveloped not to say shallow and cartoonish but some of those cartoons do work and the whole experience is rather enjoyable even if it's very far from a masterpiece. One big plus - everybody in it knows they're not making a masterpiece being straight forward is a plus in my book.

Debra Hill was one of the producers and there is a few inside jokes here referring to Halloween which is the film that made her famous.The film had some cheesy parts which really made me like the movie a lot less, the main cheese moment was a blues song the kids sung with the legendary Albert Collins. That was pushing it a bit too far right there.Fans of 80's comedies will love this. It does hold up pretty well even though its over 20 years old.

Then, within a couple of months, I see it on cable late night while working and I tell myself not to bother watching it, because I have the uncut version on DVD, but I end up watching it again, anyway. It's not my favorite movie, but it's in the top three, anyway (right up there with ""Officer & a Gentleman"" and ""Rock Star"").9 out of 10 stars!",Adventures in Babysitting
48,Gideon24,Shue is the show here,7,18 July 2013,"Elisabeh Shue's utterly enchanting performance in the starring role is the centerpiece and main selling point of 1987's ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, a highly improbable but richly entertaining comedy that stars Shue as Chris Parker,a high school senior, whose night of babysitting turns into a raucous night of danger and excitement for Chris and her young charges. It doesn't score a lot of points in the reality department, but for old fashioned mindless fun, you can't beat it. There is one funny scene after another here, with the scene in the blues club being a definite standout. Keith Coogan and Anthony Rapp are amusing as the two teens under Chris' care and Calvin Levels also scores as a sympathetic crook, but this distaff re-thinking of FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF is Shue's show all the way and she makes it a pleasure.",Adventures in Babysitting
49,Meredith-7,Uneven 'After Hours' for the pre-teen audience,6,15 June 2000,"I though this film was pretty good about 13 years ago when it first came out, but seeing it now it was a lot easier to pick the faults.  The story is uneven, and some of the sub-plots are just plain stupid.  One that springs to mind was Dawson the mechanic as Thor, this was such a weak link and just did not fit in with the rest of the film.  We all knew that Sarah was a bit Thor fan, but the scene with Dawson was cheesy, contrived and just plain stupid.  Most of the other sub-plots were all O.K, in fact some were fairly amusing.  I liked the singing the blues scene, the escape scene and the last 15-20 minutes were not too bad at all. But some of the dialogue seemed a bit contrived and it seemed like the writers were just missing the mark with a lot of things as they were treated on such a superficial level.  Still Shue was appealing in one of her first lead roles, and I did like Miller in the understated role as Shue's best friend.  The film does seem to have dated a bit due to the fashions adorned, especially Shues and the kids.",Adventures in Babysitting

Anyway, this movie would have been better if when those kids decided to travel into the city they were killed instead. That would have been better, that little girl is really annoying, and who the hell is into Thor that much? Surly not little girls.What this movie does really well is show exactly how people from the suburbs are. They're worthless, useless wastes of good organs. This movies hits the nail on the head when showing/describing surbanites. The people portrayed in this movie are EXACTLY how people from the suburbs are, even those this was made 20 years ago, they still are the same! It will never change.",Adventures in Babysitting
51,blacklist-1,An absolute gem of an 80s movie that is really funny and terrifically written!,9,27 March 2021,"My friend recommended this to me as I really needed a fun and light movie to watch and Adventures in Babysitting certainly delivered! Plus the fact that Elizabeth Shue was the main lead was a big plus for me (as those reading they may know she played Ali in the first Karate Kids film a few year prior to this movie).I wasn't sure what to expect when it started but from the first moment when Chris Parker appears on the scene dancing with some of the great 80s music of the era, I was sucked in. The acting across the entire cast was really good including having some pleasantly familiar well known actor faces also turning up. Chris going to babysit the Andersons kids for the evening, I thought what could go wrong? It all starts when she is forced to bring them along in her mother's car to the city to pick up her friend Brenda who has become stranded at the bus station.But it's not quite as simple as that as the characters get into mishap after accidental mishap and things gets worse for them as the night goes on until they end up getting pursued by the mafia! The film is terrifically written with lots of hilarious moments and so cleverly structured, when just when you think things can't any worse and even seeming harmless actions like picking up a playboy magazine can have huge consequences. The pacing is perfect throughout and never lets up to the end, with you coming to care about the characters. Elizabeth Shue shines in this film throughout, especially in one of my fav moments when they have to sing the babysitting blues. She actually has a pretty good voice!This brings me on to the other biggest plus of the movie, which is the terrific music. All the songs chosen fit perfectly and there wasn't a moment when my foot wasn't tapping along to it. Watching this made me laugh and smile a lot and a lot is packed in to it's 100 minutes run time. The fact it achieves this with such great pacing and doesn't feel rushed or dragged is an amazing achievement! Babysitting has never seemed so dangerous! I loved every minute of viewing this slightly underrated gem!",Adventures in Babysitting
52,skullhead739,Enjoyable goofy family movie,7,28 February 2020,"I am definitely a 80s movie fan and this movie didnt disappoint. Very enjoyable and goofy reminding me of goonies.Acting:
The performances are not oscar winning but the characters are really well written and the acting goes along with it great. Everyone does a good job at portraying their interesting and quirky characters.Cinematography:
Obviously 80s movie quality but nothing wrong with that at all. Very good use of special affects and camera shots.Story:
By the title can you guess the story is very goofy? Well yes it is, but it's also very funny, quirky and heart warming. A great family movie and just movie in general. Showcases why 80s movies really shine with a story and characters you wouldnt see from a newer movie.Summary:
Overall I would highly suggest this movie. Very enjoyable for me, love the story, characters and quirkiness of it all. If you like goonies, weird science, ferris bueller's day off etc.. you should like this one.",Adventures in Babysitting
53,Dragoneyed363,Wonderful entertainment,9,10 July 2008,"Adventures in Babysitting was overall a pretty freaking fun feel- good film from the 80s. It had it's moments of glory, and for the main part it keeps your attention with giggly antics and ridiculous situations and characters like a true 80s feel-good is supposed to. I did find it to be just a little boring at times, and a lot of the material that was supposed to be hilarious was not as funny as the director probably thought it was, but who could hate a movie as cute and lovable as this?My favorite parts in the movie are all the scenes that involve Brenda. The scene where she picks up the rat thinking it's a cat, and the scene where she tells the homeless man that he just moved were incredibly humorous. The whole film was sort of slapshtickish, and I like slapstick when done right. Not a masterpiece, but still a great time. It was cleverly written, which is something that's hard to find in films nowadays.(Oh, the scene from the poster has always been one of my favorites too!)",Adventures in Babysitting

The plot concerns Chris Parker (Shue) and her babysitting charges as they go into Chicago to pick up Shue's friend.  Of course, this easy task becomes more and more complicated as disaster after disaster ensues.  The film gets silly after a while and gets bogged down in a car stealing plot, but remains enjoyable.  Shue is the reason to see this film, and she manages to hold it together and keep us interested.",Adventures in Babysitting
56,Noirdame79,A Laugh-Fest All The Way!,8,24 July 2005,"This is still one of my all-time favorites. I recently bought the DVD, and I've watched it several times since. Okay, it's not exactly realistic, but it's not intended to be. That's the whole point, so don't be afraid to indulge!!! It really takes you back to your teen years, especially if you ever babysat and wished for some excitement instead of boredom. Chris Parker (a marvellous Elisabeth Shue) is a beautiful high school senior who was anticipating celebrating with her boyfriend, Mike (Bradley Whitford) regarding their anniversary. However, the jerk (as the viewers know) stands her up with some really lame excuse and she ends up babysitting for the Andersons, who have a very curious and adorable daughter, Sara, (Maia Brewton) and a teenage son, Brad, (Keith Coogan, grandson of the great Jackie Coogan) who secretly makes puppy eyes at Chris. Brad's obnoxious best friend, Daryl (Anthony Rapp) shows up and wants in when Chris receives a frantic phone call from her best friend, Brenda (a wonderfully comedic Penelope Ann Miller), who has run away from home, only to be stranded at a downtown Chicago bus stations with some really pricelessly goofy characters. Our heroine dares to take the rugrats with her to rescue her pal, and they encounter one outrageous adventure after another. In the process, they blow a tire, meet up with an amputee truck driver, witness an assault, end up being dragged down to a automobile heisting operation, chased by the bad guys, singing in a blues club (one of the best sequences), come between a gang war on a subway, crash (almost literally) a frat party, and discover that Chris's guy has been two-timing her with an ""easy chick"", and end up at the Anderson's party downtown. And they do, finally accomplish their mission to rescue Brenda, while trying to beat the progenetors home!!! Whew!!! No wonder Chris decides that this is going to be her first and last job!!!! The 60s soundtrack does nothing to hurt the film, in fact, it enhances it, especially the opening track, ""He Kissed Me"" by the Crystals. (A moment that every girl dreams about). The situations are hilarious, with as always, the charmingly clueless yuppie parents, funny villains, and resourceful protagonists. I applauded when Daryl returned a long overdue favor to Mike in the French restaurant, and the facial expression on Daryl's face on the freeway when they are approached by ""Handsome"" John Pruitt just takes the cake!!! And that George Newburn, as college guy Dan, is such a cutie. Vincent D'Orinifo's appearance is notable as well. Fun, fun fun! ""Oh, gee, Daryl, are you a gear-head and a sex fiend?"" A laugh riot!",Adventures in Babysitting
57,steeleronaldr,Never gets old,10,29 May 2021,"This movie may have it's issues but so did Ferris Bueller, at least Adventure In Babysitting was a bit more believable. Chris Parker gets bad news about a dinner date in Chicago and ends up Babysitting. When she gets a call from Brenda (her best friend) who ran away from home and now stranded in the city Chris Parker head's out to pick her up and the movie just starts with one event after another.Chris Columbus right out of the gate does an amazing job directing. The cast is perfect as each character is so different and loveable. A movie that offers Drama, Action, Music, Suspense and of course Comedy.

58,ed_two_o_nine,Do places and events like this exist / happen?,5,27 February 2008,"One for the kids me thinks. Wow this is a dated movie that as a British person I find real hard to empathise with. Do we really have our own version of these white middle class suburbs where you just do not see poor or ethnic people (unless they are serving you at the mall!!). I am not sure we do (we are just too densely populated). Anyway the movie. What we have here is basically a baby sitting assignment gone wrong that forges friendship. Whilst not the greatest premise ever seen (even for a teen movie) is not bad and when you sew in the sub plot of the relationship of the lead character (Elizabeth Shue) and a couple of cameo's by future television stars Bradley Whitford and Vincent D'Onofrio (with a particularly funny take on Thor). Whilst babysitting after being stood up on a date Chris (a female Chris) gets a call from a friend stranded at the local bus station and has to take the kids she's sitting for into town to rescue her friends. All sorts of high jinks occur with no notable acting or direction (but then Chris Columbus never really improved there). With everything coming together pretty much as any seasoned viewer would expect. Nothing great but not harmful either. Would I watch it again? Probably not, unless I was holes up in a hotel on holiday and it was the only English speaking movie I could find. Then maybe.",Adventures in Babysitting
59,JackCerf,A Few Good Moments But Falls Flat,4,18 January 2021,"This was a disappointment then and is very problematic by modern standards because of its assumptions about class and race. It's the flip side of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Instead of daytime Chicago as an adventure playground for white kids from the North Shore suburbs, it gives us nighttime Chicago as a place of darkness and danger for them.There are a couple of charming bits -- the gag when the Thor-obsessed 7 year old girl sees the hunky blond mechanic (Vincent Phillip Donofrio) holding the sledgehammer, and when Elizabeth Shue blunders onto the stage of a blues club and has to deliver an impromptu blues rap about her troubles to get off. There's one distasteful bit, also found in Sixteen Candles, where the horny middle school boy gets lucky snogging an older girl too drunk to know what she is doing.But the main problem is the structure of the romance. The picture starts with Elizabeth Shue dancing and dressing for a date to ""And Then He Kissed Me, which is used as a sexual ""I want"" song like ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" in State Fair. The driver of the plot is that Shue's ripe high school virgin is on the brink of falling in love and having sex with someone, almost anyone, though not, it turns out, her impatient high school boyfriend. The structure of the story requires her to meet and fall in love with some guy who earns her. That should be be the native boy who guides her and protects her from the dangers of the urban jungle (I use those racist tropes deliberately because the movie does) at great risk and effort. But he's too urban, too poor, and above all too black for this nice blonde white girl from the 'burbs, so he disappears by the wayside. Instead, out of nowhere the movie throws her this random good looking slightly older white college guy at a fraternity party. She melts for him apparently because why not, it has to be somebody. Not only is the ending distasteful, it falls completely flat as a romance.
And I've always wondered how Shue is going to explain to her parents where she met this older college guy the first time he comes to the house to pick her up for a date.",Adventures in Babysitting

Elizabeth Shue shows a large spectrum of talent with singing, dancing and great comedic timing. It is a shame that she never became a larger star as her talent is so evident. Penelope Ann Miller was terrific too and Vincent D from Law and Order CI is literally unrecognizable as he has slightly changed over the years.

63,davidjanuzbrown,In My Top 10 Films Ever,10,30 August 2012,"There are certain films that I never tire of and this is one of them. It goes without saying that this film has everything you could possibly want in a film and more. It has a flawless cast headed by Elisabeth Shue (Chris), Maia Brewton (Sara), Keith Coogan (Brad), and Vincent D'Onofrio (Dawson). Spoilers ahead: Here is a little bit of how the film starts out. Chris who is babysitting Sara and Brad (His Friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) also stayed over), and they had to make a trip into Chicago to pick her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), who ran away from home, and they essentially go through hell trying to pick up Brenda and get back home. Some of the things they went through included being chased down by the mob (Daryl stole a copy of Playboy that has betting information, because he saw the centerfold is a dead ringer for Chris), and ending up in in an all-black blues bar, with the rule being ""Nobody gets out of here without singing the blues."", so they have to singing ""Babysitting Blues"", which not only the owner but all the customers get into. Finding out that the guy she was seeing, is actually a creep who instead of being sick (As he claimed), was taking another woman out to dinner. She thought it was beneath her to strike back, but Daryl did not. He kicked him in the ass, and his face fell straight into a cake. Having their car break down and have to be towed to Dawson's Garage, without enough money to get the repairs, and without the money can't get home). This is a great scene, because Sara thinks he is Thor (He looks like him), and is able to melt his heart, and he gives them a break on the price. There are about 4 or 5 other incredible scenes that I love in this movie, and there is not one wasted moment from start to finish. It goes without saying I love this movie and although I have seen thousands of films, it cracks my Top 10. Saying I give it 10/10 is redundant.",Adventures in Babysitting
64,aeo,Surprisingly smart funny movie!,10,29 July 2004,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young and vaguely remember it being funny.  I had a chance to see this movie again recently and was greatly surprised on how well the story and the characters were written.  One would think by the title of the film that it would be another low-budget movie but it was not.  It had a good story, well-developed characters, and good performance by young actors and actresses.  *************POSSIBLE SPOILERS***************The movie stars the young Elizabeth Shue who portrays a senior in high school in a rich suburb of Chicago, where she has just been asked to babysit her neighbors children after her boyfriend just canceled an important date. The neighbors children consist of a young girl who is infatuated with the Marvel comic book hero Thor and a fifteen year old male teenager who has been in love with this babysitter since she began to babysit him at a young age.The children's parents leave for a party and the babysitter relaxes thinking this will be another boring night, however, she receives a call from her friend who just ran away from home and is at the train station in Chicago. She is scared and wants her to come and pick her up.  The babysitter cannot leave the children alone and so she takes them and one of the teenagers' friend on a wild and crazy adventure.In her pursuit to pick up her friend, they have to deal with being in a love quarrel where pistol is being fired, and then, being in a stolen car that results in gangster-like characters chasing them because they posses information about their operation.The reason why this movie is so funny is that the characters are rich and come from a secluded suburban area who never had to deal with the hard life of the inner-city.  Their reaction and the solution they come up with to resolve some of the conflicts that they encounter is truly funny.  One scene I really enjoyed was when they were in a blues club and they were told they could not leave without singing the blues.  Really funny!****************END POSSIBLE SPOILERS**************This is a good family movie for generally all family members to see.  But don't be dissuaded by thinking that by being a family type movie that it will be boring to adults because the story and the characters will quickly disarm you with its surprisingly witty story and smart dialogue.",Adventures in Babysitting
65,kill-the-boxtrolls,Fun for kids,6,16 July 2011,"I remember watching this when I was in third grade at school and yet I used to love it that I also remember it coming on television that I had to go and watch it whenever it came on. The movie was funny and I could laugh at anything.Now, at 17, I couldn't remember much about this movie since I didn't watch it for the past years. So, when I borrowed it from the library, learning that it was about a woman who agrees to take care of three kids and must revenge to save her friend who has ran away and spend the whole night trying to find her, I found the movie to be O.K. overall.I remember how it used to be called, ""A Night on the Town"" and I was baffled by the change in the title.17-year-old Chris Parker (Elizabeth Shue) is stood up by her boyfriend (Bradley Whitford). She is then convinced to babysit. While taking care of three kids, Brad, the older brother of the Anderson family, Sara, the bratty and bossy younger sister, and Daryl, the vigorous high-school boy whom we know is the best friend of Brad. One of the kids are obsessed with the comic book, Thor, so the adventure may turn out to be rambunctious... and it does.With loads of laughter, scares and cliffhangers, this chilling adventure blended with all three action-packed dimensions turns it into a one big adventure for the whole family. Though, I'm going to have to say that the acting was pretty bad for an 80s film and could've used some work, the script was fairly entertaining for all and I think the whole movie was just fun, fun fun. The one thing I found annoying was the little girl, Sara. She was a bit of a self-centered kid at some points, but she turns out to be good and she learns to care and she also learns that it's better to let the big brother do what he does and what he wants.6.1/10",Adventures in Babysitting

His films mainly seem to deal with upper middle class suburban kids. This movie wasn't an exception but the film kind of made light of that in an intelligent way when the babysitter and company go downtown.Elizabeth Shue's character gets stood up on a date and gets a call to babysit.

In fact, it's #02 on my 80s list, next to ""Labyrinth"" (1986). It's just one of those films I can watch over and over again... and have! I fell in love with Elisabeth Shue watching this movie, and I have to say that this movie is the best movie she's ever made and it's no surprise that she actually did win an award for Best Actress for this and good on here. She's amazing!I have often wondered why they named it ""Adventures In Babysitting"" in the US. Here in the UK it's called ""A Night On The Town"" which I much prefer. There's so many different Babysitting movies that can all be called ""Adventures In Babysitting"" but the UK given title for it sounds much better. THE DVD! I have to comment on the DVD artwork - it's not the best and if I'm totally honest, yes I have noticed that the clothes they are wearing on the DVD cover (especially Elisabeth Shue) are not the same as what they wear in the movie. In fact Shue doesn't ever wear a dress showing her legs but have a look on the DVD cover and you'll see different. I'm also very surprised as to why the DVD doesn't include special features. I do actually have the film on Blu-Ray now and it's the exact same as the DVD (obviously HD quality and has title music playing over the main menu which I am impressed with!) but it's a shame there's no cast interviews on this.THE SOUNDTRACK! Definitely one of the best soundtracks of the 80s and of course the opening scene to the film is just the best. Who's actually sat and watched Elisabeth Shue do the infamous dance and lip-syncing to The Crystals ""Then He Kissed Me"" Great opening to a movie, it's awesome and she's just stunning. This film really did make her career. I'm not sure if there has been an official soundtrack release for this movie but there should be. Every song featured throughout the movie is just classic, quality stuff.It's great to see Shue and the gang singing in the Blues club, some great words to the ""Babysitting Blues"" song and you can actually believe that Shue made the song up on the spot considering she gets forced to sing her way out of the club! Brilliant stuff!I thoroughly enjoy towards the end of the movie during the Edwin Starr ""25 Miles"" scene where they are rushing home. Again watch out for Elisabeth Shue fly jump over the couch and perfectly into place pretending she's been sat there the whole night. If I'm spoiling any moments here for those that haven't seen it, I do apologise, it's just hard not to mention the best parts of this movie. The rest of the cast are great, and congratulations to Maia Brewton on winning an award for Best Young Actress - an award well deserved. Also, I hate to break it to you, but unfortunately there is going to be a remake due in 2016 by Disney! I for one will most likely not give it a chance, you know what they say ""You don't f**k with the original"" just like you don't ""f**k with the babysitter!""

73,Nothinggrandproductions,"A simple, fun 80s flick",8,14 July 2014,"The 80s might be my favorite era of movies, which I realize to many movie enthusiasts, is probably a sin. I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of ""classic"" movies made in the 60s downward but I still try to catch up on them all the time, so I suppose this opinion is subject to change but regardless, many of my favorite movies were made in the 80s. But Adventures in Babysitting is one of those films with just a certain 80s charm that can't be entirely replicated nowadays. Is it that ambitious? No, not really. Is it very entertaining? Absolutely. It has some strange quirks and weird things that are mostly found in 80s movies because the 80s was kinda quirky and weird. (Well at least as far as I can tell without growing up in the era). The story itself is a very basic fish out of water story with a bunch of white kids in the suburbs getting thrown into crazy events in the city of Chicago that are obviously outrageous and over the top because it's a movie. Right from the opening scene of Chris Parker (Elisabeth Shue) dancing like a fool in her bedroom alone, you kinda realize this movie is going to have at least some certain charm to it. Chris is stood up by her boyfriend and then ends up having to babysit for the Andersons' children: Sara (Maia Brewton) and Brad (Keith Coogan). But a third guest comes along Darly Coopersmith (Anthony Rapp) after he finds out that Chris is taking all of them into the city when she gets a call from her friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller) who decided to run away from home like an idiot. Brenda is essentially the B-plot of the film and they cut to her character here and there for some easy laughs but it's enjoyable nonetheless. Everything essentially turns horrible once the tire on Chris' car goes flat and they then get picked up by a trucker with a hook for a hand, they get involved with a car thief, they go to a Blues club (which might be my favorite scene in the film), college parties, etc. Just about everything that could go wrong, goes wrong. The movie is simply a fun comedy with an interesting enough plot to go with it and a certain 80s charm that can't really be replicated nowadays. Besides, who wouldn't rather go see Transformers: Age of Extinction and have their brain turn to mashed potatoes instead of watching an actual fun film made in the world of Hollywood like Adventures of Babysitting? Sigh. Overall, it's a fun movie; a harmlessly fun movie with some nice quirks to it and maybe some harmless fun would be okay in Hollywood today more often (And does certainly still exist along with actual intelligent movies like the recently released Dawn of the Planet of the Apeshow did I manage to mention Transformers and Planet of the Apes in a review for Adventures in Babysitting?)",Adventures in Babysitting

This whole movie, from start to finish, is a 100% delight and one of the sweetest and cutest movies from the 80's.

However this is obvious a family movie, so all the adventure is mild mannered and, well, fun...Just set your mind to zero, expect harmless entertainment to kill some time, and watch it.

76,the-jerk,Brenda Brenda Brenda!,9,14 May 2005,"""Adventures in Babysitting"" is an underrated gem featuring a very strong young cast. The movie opens with Chris Parker (played by Elizabeth Shue in a very early starring role) first finding out that her boyfriend can't make their big date that night. So she agrees to babysit Sara and Brad Anderson, played by Maia Brewton and Keith Coogan (both of whom have dropped off the face of the earth, apparently, in the last 10 or 15 years). Sara's kind of a brat, and Brad has a crush on Chris. Brad's best friend Daryl (played by Anthony Rapp, who went on to appear in ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Road Trip""), who is an annoying wise-ass, also drops by. Things go okay until Chris gets a call from her best friend Brenda (Penelope Ann Miller), who says that she ran away from home, and is now stuck at a bus station in the city with no money and no way home, and of course she can't call her parents. This prompts Chris to take the kids (including Daryl) on a little trip, and of course, hilarious hijinks ensue.They have a tire blow-out, and are helped by a mechanic with a hook for a hand. Their car is then stolen, and they go to try to get it back. They're caught by the mobsters running the car ring, and have to escape (which they achieve by walking along a very thin metal beam overhead). But the mobsters catch them trying to leave, forcing them on the run and leading to one of the funniest scenes in the movie: going through a blues club, the singer stops them, saying ""Ain't nobody leaves here without singing the blues."" So they do, Chris leading, singing a song about their predicament. It's both cute and hilarious, with the others joining in singing back-up (""And we should be in bed!"").The rest of the movie is about them being chased through the city by these mobsters, and of course, there's one funny bit after another, with some suspenseful bits thrown in for good measure. This is all hilarious, but the best scenes are the ones interspersed throughout with Brenda trying to get along at the bus station. Penelope Ann Miller truly steals the show; scared out of her skull, she has to contend with such problems as a bum yelling at her to get out of his ""house"" (a phone booth); getting her glasses stolen by a bag lady (the look on the bag lady's face when she puts them on and realizes she can see is priceless); a hot dog vendor who won't help her out (""Then I don't have a wiener!"" he says when she says she doesn't have any cash); and a jumbo-sized sewer rat she tries to rescue, thinking it's a cute little kitty cat (because she can't see). This is probably the best part Penelope Ann Miller has ever had, and she demonstrates a surprising talent for screwball comedy.Like I said, the rest of the young cast is great; Shue pretty much began her career here, and Coogan, Rapp, and Brewton (who was also very funny on the also underrated TV show ""Parker Lewis Can't Lose"", which I'm dying to see come out on DVD) put in funny, though clichéd, parts. ""Adventures in Babysitting"" is one of those movies that just sounded kind of dumb based on the title (like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), but if you haven't seen it, give it a try anyway; the brilliant gags and the strong acting made it work.",Adventures in Babysitting

And, back then, those titles were some of my personal favorites.However, now that I find myself walking down the hallways of high school, they have lost some of their charm, A) because I've grown up, and B) because I know a lot more of and about movies.Still, watching the totally implausible story of a pretty high school girl (played by the then-unknown Elisabeth Shue) and her babysitting charges venture around an exagerrated (yet fairly tame) variation of Chicago, Illinois still has its moments of fair charm and fun.

There is an air of innocence to the whole thing, before these more conscious and overtly cynical days that we know and hate now - maybe a reason why 1980s retro is all the rage now... that, and things are cyclical.I thought the film WAS charming, although entirely far-fetched in its plot lines, although I think that was kind of the point. The characters, while not being very complicated, were warm and at least not entirely two-dimensional, and the little girl was quite cute and not extremely annoying as could have happened.Overall, I'd recommend it to hounds who love to watch 80s films.",Adventures in Babysitting

I did enjoy the chases, the mistaken identity and what a sex-crazed idiot Darryl was. (Saw Anthony Rapp in School Ties too, where his performance was near perfect.) I fully enjoy this movie and both of my under-school-age children did too. still watch it to this day, (Goes for Goonies too), and think it is a great family movie.

While babysitting, her friend Brenda gets stuck in the city and must picked up. This is the start of a crazy, wacky, and fun adventure (as the title of the movie states). The movie, while far from being great, is a lot of fun to watch, and has a lot of funny scenes and moments. There are a few corny moments, and the movie as a whole is unbelievable, but nevertheless its just as much fun. One thing that should be noted is, that while this looks like a family movie its not really. It has quite a bit of profanity and sexual material. My rate for Adventures in Babysitting.

Years from now, ""Adventures In Babysitting"" will be mentioned in the same breath as such great films as ""The Godfather,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and ""The Goonies"" (another film that was erroneously snubbed when the top films were voted on).Sara, Kris, Daryl, Brad, Pruitt, Joe Gipp, and Brenda. It is nearly impossible to have a conversation about classic film characters without mentioning these 7 greats (often referred to by film historians as the ""Magnificent Seven"").  Some might argue that Vito Corleone or Charles Foster Kane, or Chunk from ""Goonies"" are the most unforgettable film characters, but I defy anyone to find as many classic characters in one film as there are in ""AIB"".Much like the name suggests, ""Adventures In Babysitting"" delivers heart-pounding excitement and gut-wrenching thrills, but there is so much more to this movie that many people simply can not understand how it was possible to create such a masterpiece.  One moment we are worrying about Brenda while the ""Fab 4"" (Daryl, Kris, Sara, and Brad) are running for their lives while managing to provide us, the audience, with many moments of laughter and excitement.There are always those who fear change.  When Hank Aaron challenged Babe Ruth's career home run record there were many people who opposed it, and as it goes there are those who will do anything to keep ""AIB"" from fulfilling its fate as the greatest film of all time, as voted by IMDB users. By giving it average or below average votes, a fickle attempt has been made by this ""coup de etat"" to keep ""AIB"" from the top.

84,NotSureifthisis7734,An attempt at a John Hughes movie without John Hughes -- it doesn't work.,1,11 August 2009,"I have seen this movie but not in a single sitting. What happens it that it is playing on the TV, I watch for a few minutes, find that I have take all that I can take and then leave the room. During those few minutes I do not laugh once, experience no pleasure in what I am viewing, and find myself more depressed that angry. Interestingly, I am told the psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be angry and depressed at the same time. This movie tests that theory.I think part of the problem is that I spent nearly ten years in Chicago so as I am watching the scenes I am thinking of my own experiences in that rotten town and thus I am clearly bringing a lot of my baggage to the piece. It is entirely possible, I am willing to concede, that if you are not a Chicago denizen you will find the piece amusing. If so, I envy you.And yet. John Hughes set his films in Chicago and those movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was a first rate writer. I think it obvious he knew how to comically balance his situations, as well as make his characters both sympathetic and believable. In a comedy (as distinguished from a farce) this balance vital. And it is not easy to achieve. If it was everyone would be making great movies and we would not have to fret as we do in the real world wondering when genius will ever appear. In ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" it doesn't. I hated those characters. There is a difference, profound and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic.For me every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor, no humanity, no people one can recognize. Just actors reading their lines as if it all they can do to restrain themselves from screaming them out, certain that finally hilarity will ensue, this time for sure! It's like watching the antics of very bad comedians. It's embarrassing and after a while, usually at the point when I get up and leave, I start to feel pity for all concerned, which is a kind of emotional connection, I suppose. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. She doesn't act, certainly not act comically, and it's entirely possible she can't. But lord how she tries. She looks older than 17, and acts way younger like a seven-year old straining in a school play certain that this is how one gets an award. And she is not alone. It is as if everyone cannot relax and let the tale flow. As if everyone simply has no idea what they are doing. Now, this was an early effort for Chris Columbus and he clearly would improve and having better writers (e.g. John Hughes himself) certainly helped, so perhaps some forgiveness is in order. But the film just reeks of desperation. Yet like I said it may work for some. If any of the above appeals to you, and it clearly did some of the reviewers, then go get the DVD and knock yourself out. Otherwise, avoid this mess like you would a dark Chicago alley where as you hurry by you can only see shadows and hear muttered threats.",Adventures in Babysitting

87,TheSteelHelmetReturns,I like this brand of 80s film.,8,6 November 2010,"Adventures in Babysitting opens with a scene of a standard 80s teenager, Elizabeth Shue, dancing in her bedroom with white floral wallpaper while she puts her clothes on to 'And then he kissed me' designed to make all male viewers recoil within the first 15 seconds of the film and think of movies where Shue engages in a sex scene. Shue, who plays Chris Parker, is then asked to babysit a young effeminate male with an attraction to older women and his younger sister who wears a distracting Thor helmet throughout the film only to be later joined by the young man's best friend, Dre-dog, who looks equally bi-curious but brings the funny. Chris's best friend Brenda, surprisingly not played by Joan Cusack, then calls Chris informing her that she ran away from home and is stuck in a Chicago bus terminal so Brenda and the kids hop into the car to pick her up and mayhem adequately ensues. The film follows a series of different comedic sequences familiar in 'fish out of water' stories where sheltered suburban kids experience the horrors of the city and the underclass while trying desperately to find Brenda and return home. There's some effectively directed scenes of suspense when the character's lives are threatened by local gangsters that involve some quite agile maneuvers of escape that make me wish I was young and athletic again. Other hijinks include a musical sequence in a blues club, the suburban answer to gang violence, double entendres, fainting, 'before they were famous' cameos and all the other staples of a solid 80s family film. I'm not sure if there's a moral to the story but it doesn't matter.",Adventures in Babysitting

What an imagination that talented person has! Did you notice that each one of them - the babysitter and 3 kids - became a hero at some point during the movie? And the name ""Thor"" popped into my mind, too, when that gorgeous man came into view. ""Who is he?"" I wondered, because he looked so familiar. It wasn't until he smiled that I recognized him as Vincent D'Onofrio. Beverly D'Angelo lookalike Elizabeth Shue, Maia Brewton, Keith Coogen, and Anthony Rapp were also terrific. I'll have to watch it again to get the name of the character (and, thus, actor) who was the car thief. He, too, looked very familiar, like a long, lost friend, and did a wonderful job.

Elisabeth Shue does a wonderful job as the babysitter, and Maia Brewton will steal your heart as Sarah, the wise and resourceful little sister. Keith Coogan plays big brother Brad, and Anthony Rapp is fun as Darryl Coopersmith, Brad's fun-loving but short-on-brains buddy. A couple of highlights are when Brad makes an insulting comment about Sarah's favorite superhero, Thor. She demands that he take it back or she'll blab to Chris about his secret crush on her (Chris was standing within earshot the whole time).

She is scared and wants her to come and pick her up. The babysitter cannot leave the children alone and so she takes them and one of the teenagers' friend on a wild and crazy adventure.In her pursuit to pick up her friend, they have to deal with being in a love quarrel where pistol is being fired, and then, being in a stolen car that results in gangster-like characters chasing them because they posses information about their operation.The reason why this movie is so good is that the characters are rich and come from a secluded suburban area who never had to deal with the hard life of the inner-city, and One interesting moment in the movie is when they were in a blues club and they were told they could not leave without singing the blues.This is really good, and also fun movie to enjoy.",Adventures in Babysitting

For the record I am a guy and it is probably not the most manly thing to say that I love a movie about babysitting.Watching it as an adult I have noticed that this movie is really a blues movie at heart. First and foremost the aspect of the movie that had the most heart and realism for me was the older brother Brad's infatuation with Chris the babysitter. He was always the one I identified with as a young boy. He is so enamored of her and is so awkward about it, but at the same time genuine. And yet, unlike most hokey Hollywood films he doesn't magically get the girl. This is what the blues are all about. You love a girl and she doesn't love you back. Elizabeth Shue is amazing as always and I just learned that this was her first movie. I guess as a kid you don't really realize that these people are acting or at least not in this movie because it all seems so natural. She then went on to star in Cocktail, Back to the Future II and II and then Leaving Las Vegas in 1995. Sara, the little girl was the part of this movie that is still enjoyable after all these years. It seems to me that lately children in movies are incredibly annoying or they make the movie dramatic and it isn't enjoyable. Yes, the movie is dated now, but I think gives a pretty good overall impression of what we all thought was going on in the 80's. I find the movie a little bittersweet as it reminds me of an innocent childhood that has passed. I always wonder how people who haven't seen movies like this or Princess Bride, Goonies, Stand by Me, etc... will think of them if they watch them for the first time when they are in their 20's. I just don't think movies have the same magic when you are an adult. Enough rambling, go watch the movie if you haven't seen it. And watch it again if you haven't seen it for years.",Adventures in Babysitting
111,songwryter,Great !,9,29 April 2020,Always remembered this movie as a kid. Now i own a copy of it. Funny... suspenseful... action... adventure... nothing mind blowing but enjoyable! One of my fav classics.,Adventures in Babysitting
112,ali_a87,"A great movie, even today!",7,25 September 2005,"People might say this is an old movie, thus it's excitement and fun have passed away like the years since this movie was made. I'm 18, and I was fortunate enough to watch this movie even if it was yesterday.The movie is really fun to watch and there is suspense so cleverly set in the movie that the viewer is often in a false sense of security and suddenly it changes. This was not the first movie in which I fell in love with Elisabeth Shue, her parts in Back To The Future III and Hollow Man were quite impressive. OK, Alright, I admit she is 24 years older than me but she is still as beautiful as she ever was. Anyway, where was I?. Oh yes, the movie. People , you need to watch this for yourself and this is a must have for your DVD library, you'll never tire out by listening to the brilliant songs and the music. Psst, Elisabeth sings a song herself in the movie. Hope you enjoy it.",Adventures in Babysitting
113,Dave-687,The #1 Reason Why I Love Movies,10,24 September 1999,"When I saw this exciting, hysterical movie I loved it. Hundreds of viewings later the movie is still fresh, suspenseful and entertaining. This movie inspired me to become a screenwriter and director when I was eight. Now, as a film student in college, I still love Adventures in Babysitting alongside The Silence of the Lambs, Working Girl, Forrest Gump, and Ghost. You must watch this movie-- Jim Carrey wishes he were this funny!",Adventures in Babysitting
114,leolion5,"Yikes, watch out, this kind of Adventure you can do without",1,30 April 2006,"I would not recommend this movie. Even though it is rated G and is clearly for kids there is quite a lot of swearing (including the dreaded 'F' and 'S' words). This kind of language doesn't offend me particularly but in a kids film? Come on.There was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, between one of the early adolescent male characters and any willing adult woman who came along - including a prostitute! The acting was as good as it gets in this genre of film but the story line was very very cheesy and even my four year old remarked that it was 'stupid'.Despite having Elizabeth Shue, this film is definitely not worth checking out if you haven't seen it.",Adventures in Babysitting
115,wjvdr,Great and funny movie,7,1 March 2002,"As far as teen comedies go, this is one of the best, if not THE best. I saw it ages ago and immediately fell in love with the movie and its characters. Shue and the rest of the cast are simply great. I saw the movie on E-bay last week and even though I'm 34 now (not really the intended target audience age) I just couldn't resist and bought it. Some bits feel a bit outdated, but that does not diminish the fun I had watching it. My favourite scene is the blues singing scene, although I like the gang fight in underground as well, particularly Chris' line. You all know which one I'm referring to. All in all, I can only recommended this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it. I don't need to recommend it to people who have seen it, because they will know what an excellent movie this is.",Adventures in Babysitting
116,bornahstar,GREATEST MOVIE EVER!!!!,10,3 January 2002,"I am 15 yrs old, and I wasn't but a yr old when this movie came out. But it has been my favorite movie practically my whole life! Me and my friends/family watch it religiously! It's so funny and it's an all around great movie! Great cast, great plot, great lines! Me and my friends watch this movie everytime we get together & just laugh. It's a movie that My mom, Sisters, Brothers, Nieces, Nephews, Cousins, Aunts, Uncles, & Friends love to watch! I definatly recommend this movie to everyone!",Adventures in Babysitting
117,cdowg187,Thor!,10,17 May 2008,"Okay, I just wanna say I actually thought the little girl with the Thor Fan-girl obsession was adorable. Sure she was almost slightly psychotic. But still Adorable none the less.Also that makes me a bit of a hypocrite, because when I was that age I had a major Batman obsession. 15 years later, NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR ME! I thought it was just funny as *beep* when Vincent D'Onofrio (best known as pvt. pyle from Full Metal Jacket) played the a-hole mechanic who sort of resembled the viking god of thunder!He obviously looked nothing like Marvels version of Thor, but then again I guess he wasn't suppose to.Am I alone with the idea that it would be kind of funny if they put Vince in the Thor movie just as like a cameo or something?!Also I wish Elizabeth Shoe would have baby sat me as a kid, and taken me into the ghetto of Chi town! Some one please tell me that this movie is on DVD.",Adventures in Babysitting
118,greymichael45,One of the Best 1980's Movies Ever !!,10,1 January 2011,"It is an underrated gem and Elisabeth Shue is perfectly cast for the main role. While she is an awesome actress in many serious award winning dramatic roles this is my favorite role for her and I love the beginning of the movie that hearkens backs to the 1950's teenage comedies. Her timing is perfect and my favorite scenes are her singing ""The Babysitter Blues"" and when she sees her boyfriend out on another date. I love it when she's says ""Stephanie Plexar"", its so classic. There are so many things to love about this movie especially if you grew up in a sheltered suburban town next to a large urban city that you really can relate to as you knew girls like Chris and Brenda and guys like Mike in High School. A !0+ !!!",Adventures in Babysitting
119,Shawnfan-617-745969,Good Movie,9,26 July 2017,"Elizabth Shue always brings it, no matter the Genre of movie. Her opening seen dancing in her cute little dress and nylons is absolutely adorable. Love her.Even back in 1987 as a beautiful young-in she had an ability to light up the movie screen. I've followed her career for years and will continue to do so. Thank you Elizabeth you have given me hours of entertainment.",Adventures in Babysitting
120,Darkelementsx22,Great movie for family.,9,2 November 2020,"Adventures in Babysitting a 1987 American teen comedy film written by David Simkins, directed by Chris Columbus. It stars Elisabeth Shue, ( the baby sitter ) Vincent D'Onofrio, Maia Brewton, Keith Coogan, Anthony Rapp, Penelope Ann Miller, Bradley Whitford, and has cameos by blues singer/guitarist Albert Collins and singer-songwriter Southside Johnny Lyon.Hired to babysit a couple of kids turns into an adventure in town when shes called to help a friend thats stranded. The night goes on with several stops, twists and turns. As an adult I enjoyed it and I think its a great movie for families. Very funny.",Adventures in Babysitting
121,PChris,"Very entertaining film, appeals to the whole family",10,21 September 1998,"Elizabeth Shue (long before Leaving Las Vegas) and Keith Coogan are very funny in this action/suspense/comedy.  You understand exactly how these kids feel, lost and alone in the big city.  Yet, the humor is always there, to lighten the story.  Many of the people in this movie have gone on to bigger and better things, and watching the film, you can see why.  A great time from beginning to end!",Adventures in Babysitting
122,k.-7,This movie is a lot of fun.,9,24 June 2000,"Even after all these years, this movie still holds up.  It's a great ride from start to finish.If you haven't seen it, or you just haven't seen it recently, it's definitely worth the rental.",Adventures in Babysitting
123,mcmanusdonna,Great for an 80's cheese retro weekend...,9,28 May 2007,"I did love this movie back in the day and have watched it quite a few time since then. No deep thought needed, no philosophy, just a goofy story. I thought Chris was pretty together, Brenda was funny, Keith Coogan was likable and the young girl was weird but you sort of bought into her strangeness. I love Vincent D'Onofrio but back then I didn't know him from Adam so it's funny now when I see his work since then and then think of this role. A solid blast from the past. Not in my Top 10 80's movies but Top 15 for sure.",Adventures in Babysitting
124,stratman67,Best soundtrack you've never heard!!!,9,10 April 2009,"This is a fun movie BUT my favorite part of this movie actually is its soundtrack. I would LOVE to have the soundtrack on CD! Apart from the Rolling Stones song, the rest of the soundtrack is 100% Chicago Blues at its finest. I wish someone would re-release the soundtrack PLEASE!!!!! The cinematography is pretty good and the scenes show the REALITY of Chicago, not just the ""pretty"" parts. Most of those buildings and locales that's in this movie are still present to this day (that should tell you something about Chicago's architecture!) and can be found with a good stroll through the downtown area. Part of it was also filmed in Oak Park, Illinois (a town just north west of the city)is a nice little bucolic area where everybody knows your name(sorry).",Adventures in Babysitting
125,ktlayer51,Chicago means great Blues music,8,6 June 2009,"It would have been a shame to set a movie in Chicago and not include some great Blues music. Happily, this film manages to work a Blues jam into the 'Adventures.' Even more happily, they got the great Blues legend, the 'Ice Man' Albert Collins (1932—1993) to jam with, though his name does not appear in the credits. Collins was famous for mingling with the audience while playing.They didn't try to make it all polished like Hollywood films usually do. This jam is a little raw and rough, like the real deal, like real people really improvising. They left some spots in the jam where it was appropriately apparent that this was not something these kids do every day -- or ever before for that matter.",Adventures in Babysitting
126,campjdftl,Great film. I highly recommend for anyone.,10,6 June 2009,"3 things.I can't believe THOR was played by Vincent D'onofrio - he would have been like 28? He looked good! Seems so many were lined up for the part of CHRIS (maybe this is how it always works out?) and then the part finally went to Shue - I think she was PERFECT for the part - a real SHUE-in! For Halloween one year, i dressed in ugly drag, but I had a pretty pink dress on, and a cigarette hanging of my lip. I entered a contest and when i finally made it to the stage, the MC asked what my name was, and this movie suddenly just popped in my head (not really sure why) and i simply said in a gruff voice - I'm the babysitter! - and the crowd went wild! I ended up winning 1st place from about 20 people and that was $500 cash and lots of free drinks! Too funny! I'll watch this movie every time I see it is on TV. If I was the type to buy dvds, this one would be on my shelf.",Adventures in Babysitting
127,bluesharp94,This movie set new boundaries in movie-making.,9,28 June 2004,"I didn't want to go see this movie back in '87 with my kids, but I was dragged into it. The movie was awesome then, and it still remains a great movie. Why? The music. Anyone even remotely interested in ""The Blues"" as a music genre should have this DVD in their library. Not only do you get some great blues music as part of the scoring, the incidental Blues Club Scene, vintage Chicago, pulls this out of the ordinary to a slam for music lovers.And, ... how about the straggling scene after the credits, which is standard today. Heck, I'm in my 50s, and I still have to pull this movie out to hear the harp licks.",Adventures in Babysitting
128,ellen_moroney,Very Clever,10,17 June 2020,What an entertaining film! Not only is it funny but also suspenseful in the predicaments they get into. Excellent soundtrack and a glimpse of Southside Johnnie and blues artists from Chicago. Set in Chicago.,Adventures in Babysitting
129,smee_lia,Awesome Movie Award,10,15 January 2005,"I think this movie is totally awesome. It captures the worst nightmare of the typical babysitter. And it's good clean fun. It's the kind of movie that you NEED to watch. Ya know what I mean? It's a classic that never got credit. I especially love the part where they end up on stage and Chris ends up singing. It wonderful!! So brilliant. It's a fantastic movie, with a great cast and exception script work. {There were nights, you swear you were born to lose. And you wish your feet were in somebody else's shoes.} Awww...I'm pretty sure Brenda felt that way too on this particular night. All in all, though, it's a superb movie that everybody should watch. I wish, at times, that I had a babysitter that awesomely awesome! :)",Adventures in Babysitting
130,simspace,A really sweet and innocent comedy about a girl who babysits but has to take a tour downtown.,10,16 January 2005,"This is a really funny movie because you never really know where it's going. Basically everything that happens in it happens by accident. It's not only funny but also exciting if you aren't that old. I think it's great.It sort of reminds me about ""Afterhours"" (starring Griffin Dunne) but this is the family version of that movie. Anything can happen during a crazy night or so it seems. Elisabeth Shue is good in this movie and everyone in it seems to have had a good time making it. If you just want to see a cute movie which makes you feel good , or if you've had enough of over-dramatic epics , action that blows you out of your seat and bloody horror movies , check this out. It's sweet , funny , lovable and adventurous all at the same time. If you don't like it , there are more than enough of violence out there for you.",Adventures in Babysitting
131,mavreports06,On my top 10 list of best movies ever!,10,7 June 2005,"I love this movie! If it is on TV or I see it when renting movies, I will stop everything at watch this movie. I love the whole idea of the movie! I babysit all the time and the premise is honestly, something that probably could (and I'm sure has) happen to some unlucky babysitter. I was only 3 when this movie was made but it doesn't matter! Anthony Rapp's character, Daryl Coopersmith is hilarious! The cast and characters work so well together. The only thing that I find annoying is Sara, the little sister, but then again I am a babysitter and what babysitter wouldn't get annoyed with little kids when they make trouble. But if it weren't for Sara then there wouldn't be this movie!",Adventures in Babysitting

133,darekster,One of my guilty pleasure movies!,10,4 February 2006,"This one of those movies where you might not say it's one of your all time favorites, but secretly you will watch it whenever it comes on TV etc. For me this movies was extremely entertaining, except for a few choice words, is something almost any age group can watch. My daughter who was about 10 and born in the 90's, loved this movie. I bought the DVD and she watched over and over again.To me what was great about this movie is that it reminded me about high school and how stupid the high school scene could be. Kris was the popular beautiful senior girl and she was not supposed to talk to freshman boy. There are so many great quotes in this flick, but my favorite is at the end of the movie when after their ""adventure"", she says to the boy who is in love with her, ""I don't ignore my friends!""",Adventures in Babysitting
134,Travislclever-1,Not quite an Oscar nominee,10,18 March 2006,"Adventures in babysitting is a cute film about a 17 year old named Chris Parker(Elizabeth Shue) who gets a slap in the face reject from her boyfriend( ""My little sister got sick"") that he couldn't make their anniversary dinner, and gets stuck with babysitting a little girl for the evening. The young girl, Sara, has an older brother Brad who is head over heels for Chris (He even writes love poems about her!) Chris'friend Brenda calls the Anderson house and pleads with Chris to pick her up from the Chicago bus station (DOWNTOWN).Brad and His friend Daryl end up going along for the ride, and it is one H*LL of a ride! This was one of my sister and I's favorite movies as kids. We end up burning up a VCR from rewinding and watching it so much ( we cried for a week). Thank goodness for DVD's! If you have pre-teens, kids 8-14, they will really appreciate this movie, because it empathizes with having to have a babysitter. The soundtrack is filled with 87' style songs and some oldies. It is a great Friday night watch for the whole family.",Adventures in Babysitting
135,piperann2,This movie is offensive,1,28 March 2006,"To this day, I have never seen Elizabeth Shue in anything else because of the stench of this movie. Poorly acted, poorly plotted and racially Neanderthal, it took place in a Chicago where every black person apparently lived in a blues club. . SPOILER AHEAD. . . . . ..SPOILER: Her ""blues"" solo was even more painful to watch than her clueless acting and the intro into it - 'Nobody leaves without singing the blues' -- was as dumb as a post. The children her character was babysitting were insufferable and well before the movie's end I was wishing for something horrible to happen to all of them.I have to say though, there is one special thing about this movie; it takes a lot for a movie to offend me but this smoldering piece of tripe did what Chopper, the Phantom Menace and Catwoman could not -- make me sick to my stomach.",Adventures in Babysitting
