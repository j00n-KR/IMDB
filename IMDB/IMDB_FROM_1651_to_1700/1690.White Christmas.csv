0,MartinHafer,It's hard to imagine that this was the #1 box office film of the year.,6,28 November 2012,"""White Christmas"" is a pleasant but quite formulaic musical--a decent time-passer but not a lot more. However, rather inexplicably, the film turned out to be the #1 box office champ of the year--something I just don't understand when I see it today.The film begins during WWII. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play soldiers who are entertaining the troops during Christmas. Soon, the war is over and the two go on to Broadway and become a huge musical team--absolutely huge. The problem is that Kaye is dissatisfied, as they are always working---and his partner is always thinking of business. So, he comes up with a plan--get Bing married and then they'll have to take it easier! And, when the duo meet two musical sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney), Danny and Vera just decide that Bing MUST marry Rosemary---just like that! Not surprisingly, there are MANY bumps and misunderstandings along the way--as, after all, it IS a very formulaic relationship. What is not exactly formula, however, is the parallel plot involving Danny and Bing's old commander--the General. The General is running a hotel in Vermont--but it's failing due to unusually hot weather. So, the four decide to get together and perform a show--just the sort of thing Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland would have done a decade and a half earlier.The film has a lot of pluses and minuses. As I mentioned above, the film is easy to predict due to its strong use of traditional film formulas. However, the actors did a nice job with what they had. My biggest complaint about the film were all the song and dance numbers. There were just too many and many were quite forgettable. Several could have been cut and more emphasis should have been on plot--but, considering how successful the film was, what do I know? I just know that today the film is a bit sluggish because of this. You cannot trim the title song, but a bit of trimming would have tightened up the film and kept a better pace. Overall, it's uneven but enjoyable.",White Christmas
1,TheLittleSongbird,Excellent and timeless Christmas holiday movie,10,18 November 2009,"I can not believe that I did not see this movie before now. Maybe when I was 8, when White Christmas was on every year, I wasn't as into musicals as I am now, save movies like Annie, Wizard of Oz and Oliver! I am truly sorry, for this was an excellent film, that is perfect for the Christmas holiday season. White Christmas looks lovely, shot in beautiful Vista Vision with nice cinematography and wonderful costumes. The red dresses in the reprise of White Christmas especially were to die for. The songs and score by Irving Berlin is outstanding; the title song White Christmas is not only one of my all time favourite Christmas songs but also one of my favourite songs ever in a musical. But the other songs go without fault too, particularly The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing and Sisters.The script and story, serving as a partial remake of Holiday Inn, are top notch, if a little fluffy and implausible in places. Even better were the performances, with Bing Crosby his usual charming self as Bob, and while weak at the start Danny Kaye is superb as Phil. His dance routine with Vera Ellen, who looked gorgeous here and sang and danced a dream, was a knockout. Rosemary Clooney is positively riveting as Betty as well, in a suitably calm and subdued performance. I have to say I loved the choreography, it was clever, fast-paced and energetic. Overall, it may be fluff and a tad schmaltzy, but it is an excellent and timeless holiday movie. 10/10 Bethany Cox",White Christmas
2,bkoganbing,""".........just like the ones we used to know.""",9,11 August 2005,"By 1954 the song White Christmas had become such a timeless classic that it was inevitable that a film would be made around it. And of course the star would be none other than Bing Crosby. But who to star with him.Originally this was to be the third Irving Berlin outing for Bing and Fred Astaire. Then Donald O'Connor was to co-star, but finally Danny Kaye teamed with Der Bingle. Proved to be a felicitous combination.By then Rosemary Clooney had worked in a few films well and more importantly, she had clicked with Crosby on the radio. Bing had teamed with several girl singers over the years, like Connee Boswell, Frances Langford, Mary Martin, Trudy Erwin, Carole Richards, Peggy Lee and a trio of sisters named Andrews. But he always said Rosemary Clooney was it for him and besides Mary Martin, the only other one who did became a leading lady for him.It's not remembered because of the success of her solo career, but Rosemary Clooney started as a duo with her sister Betty who retired early to raise a family. So with Vera-Ellen as her sister in the movie, that was an aspect of the plot Rosemary could handle with ease.The plot such as it is involves Bing and Danny as a song and dance duo who've expanded into the production end of show business. Through a little bit of a con game worked by Vera Ellen, the two meet a singing sister act like the Clooney sisters were. The sisters turn out to be headed to Vermont to work at a resort and the smitten guys go along with them.Problem is there ain't any snow there. It's an unheard of 68 degrees Fahrenheit in early December. And the place is owned by Crosby and Kaye's former commander from World War II, played by Dean Jagger. He's about to lose his shirt and his pride. So our intrepid quartet go to work.Irving Berlin's score for White Christmas is about half new songs and the other half from previous scores. That's how it was when you got Irving to work for you. Listen carefully even to the background music. You will not hear one note of a non-Berlin song. One of those songs was a personal favorite of mine, Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep. I recall in grade school in Brooklyn it was a song that the teachers had us sing in the school assemblies. Little did I know that it was introduced by the guy who proved to be my favorite entertainer. It's a patented philosophical Bing Crosby song that he did best and it serves as a ballad to woo and win Rosie. Bing sings it and then Rosie joins him in the reprise.Danny Kaye has two good numbers. The first The Best Things Happen While Your Dancing is clearly originally for Fred Astaire, though Kaye and Vera Ellen make a lovely couple on the dance floor. The Choreography number I think was also done for Astaire, but here dancer John Brascia does the complicated dance routine while Kaye sings. I'm sure Astaire would have handled both jobs had the film been made with him.All the stars do the Minstrel Show/Mandy number, but Vera Ellen really shines in it. She was a great dancer, really sparkled in every film she did.Besides Sisters, Rosemary Clooney has a grand torch ballad that sold a few platters for her in Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me. She had a wonderful singing voice and the most impeccable diction of any female singer ever. You don't miss one throbbing word on any of her ballads.White Christmas was Paramount's first film done in their wide screen process called VistaVision. And of course it was proper that their number one star for over 20 years be in this film. Of course jokes about Bing's derrière and the wide screen got into the repertoire of a certain comedian named Hope.Just like the song that inspired it, White Christmas has proved to be a timeless holiday classic and will remain so.",White Christmas
3,Leofwine_draca,Solid family musical,6,24 December 2015,"White Christmas is a solid family musical with one ultra-famous Christmas song sung early on in the proceedings. For the rest of the running time it's a rather typical Hollywood musical of its era: warm, good-natured, with lots of well-choreographed dance and singing routines, and a feel-good storyline. It's not my favourite of its type - I'm a sucker for Gene Kelly - but as a Christmas musical, it shines.Bing Crosby is the obvious draw here as the film belongs to him throughout, but the supporting cast are effective too. Danny Kaye has a fairly difficult role I reckon, playing second-string to Crosby, but he comes off as amiable enough. Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen are fine as the singing sisters. Like many of its type, White Christmas flags a little in between the songs, but the musical numbers are well staged and likable, so there's little to complain about overall.",White Christmas
4,SnoopyStyle,Iconic music from Irvin Berlin,7,15 December 2013,"Army buddies Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) become a successful song and dance team after the war. They receive a letter from another army buddy introducing his sisters Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) as singing act wannabe. They become fast friends with the girls and travel to Vermont for a Christmas show. They find a failing lodge run by their former commander, and decide to save it with a grand show.As a rom-com, it's strictly vanilla flavor. There isn't much heat, and there aren't any surprises. This is really only interesting for the song and dance. And there are some great songs. It's not just the iconic title song, but there are a whole bunch of others also written by Irving Berlin. And that's the real star of this movie. It's a showcase for Irvin Berlin's talents.",White Christmas
5,Hitchcoc,Irving Berlin Music Good but a Bit Jingoistic,7,3 December 2016,"I know that people may think me unpatriotic, but the message here is that we need to continue to glorify war. The U.S. had just finished World War II and celebrated a great victory. Now we had the big Commie fear and a trip to Korea where many more of our young people dead. So in 1954 comes a ""Christmas"" movie. It pushes all the right buttons and has the stars of the day, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Bing Crosby (one of the most hawkish performers of all time) and becomes a kind of recruiting poster when we were done with war for a while (of course, we were already meddling in southeast Asia). It does have a decent story and those songs were well performed, but there is no comparison between this and ""Holiiday Inn"" which carries a much more romantic theme, and also stars Bing Crosby. The main thing for me is that at times I just find it sort of dull.",White Christmas
6,mark.waltz,More about the music than the holidays.,4,11 December 2014,"While this film certainly has a cult following, it really can't be counted as 100 percent a Christmas movie. Basically a remake of 1942's ""Holiday Inn"" where the title song from this movie was introduced (and deservedly won an Oscar), it adds color, camp, and Danny Kaye to the familiar story. Danny takes over in the role Fred Astaire played in ""Holiday Inn"", and his character adds comedy into the mix, some funny, some cloying. Technicolor loves Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen, and they wear all sorts of gorgeous gowns. Unfortunately, this mixture of pastiche and Technicolor ends up being an extremely mixed bag that brings huge smiles in some scenes, rolled eyes in others.The campiest moment comes with the duet of ""Sisters"", first seen with Vera-Ellen and Clooney, and later repeated by the mincing Crosby and Kaye. The later version was apparently done as a gag and kept in the film. A big production number saluting the old minstrel shows features the tackiest of jokes and the ugliest of costumes. It worked great in ""Kid Millions"" in 1934, but in the post war world of 1954, it is a major groaner of a number. Even duller is Kaye's ""Choreography"", as pretentious as it sounds. He does get a nice duet with Vera-Ellen, ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", while Crosby and Clooney get to sing the beautiful ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"". Clooney gets a good solo moment with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"", a mediocre song which becomes better simply because of how she sells it.As for the Christmas sequences, they open and end the film, hence the reason for the title. Dean Jagger plays the retiring General who moves to the aforementioned ""Holiday Inn"" after the end of World War II, and is given a rousing send-off. Mary Wickes shines as his housekeeper, but then again, doesn't she always shine no matter what film she's in? The two major Christmas songs are the title song, first repeated by Crosby (who introduced it in ""Holiday Inn"") and later utilized for the lavish finale where the hotel walls open up like a Broadway set. I guess you're supposed to really feel the Christmas spirit when this happens, but had the whole story surrounded the holidays rather than just the opening and conclusion, I would have been much happier. A minor little number, ""Snow"", celebrates the season nicely, but its not one of Berlin's better songs. Michael Curtiz seems an odd choice for director of a big, elephantine musical. This was a busy time for Irving Berlin as he just had another catalog of his songs done on screen (the much better ""There's No Business Like Show Business"") and the previous year's ""Call Me Madam"", both with Ethel Merman. So while he may have been considered, as Jerome Kern called him, ""American Music"", he was represented elsewhere. This musical certainly has its fans, and while I applaud much of what is in here, I have to consider this one a missed opportunity, much like Crosby's next remake of an old film of his, ""Anything Goes"", where the same studio forgot that it was based on an old Cole Porter hit, and equally as disengaging.",White Christmas
7,classicsoncall,"""I don't know what he's up to, but he's got that Rogers and Hammerstein look again"".",7,24 December 2006,"Often, repeat viewings of a movie will reward me with a greater appreciation for it, however in the case of ""White Christmas"", the effect may be the opposite, so I might better 'count my blessings' and stop with today's screening. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for nostalgia, but this one appears to have aged rather poorly, perhaps for no other reason than the passage of time and changing tastes.Probably the thing that works against the film the most is the choice of songs that have nothing to do with Christmas or the holiday season. Yes, there's the title song and repeated lines from 'Snow', but what's up with the 'Mandy' dance number and the 'Choreography' routine. Rosemary Clooney's Carousel Club song, ""Love, You Done Me Wrong"" seemed particularly troubling, even though it momentarily fit her situation with the Bingster. Also, another poster on this board had it right about ""What Can You Do With A General"" - I actually picked up the video sleeve to remind me what I was watching.Apart from the actual story, there's no reason not to admire the talent on display by the principals. To my mind, there's no finer singing voice than Bing Crosby's. Danny Kaye is spirited as Bing's partner, but he does tap that arm a bit much in the later going. Clooney's charm manages to come through her reserved character, but the showstopper if there is one would be Vera-Ellen in that 'Mandy' routine, watching leaves one almost as breathless as she should have been while doing it.Except for the title and the packaging, ""White Christmas"" has no claim on the truly great holiday films like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or the Alastair Sim ""A Christmas Carol"". The only thing I would like to know is if Emma (Mary Wickes) ever did resign from 'Busybody's Anonymous'.",White Christmas
8,gavin6942,Not Much to do With Christmas,7,28 December 2011,"A successful song-and-dance team (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) become romantically involved with a sister act (Rosemary Clooney and someone else) and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former commanding general (Dean Jagger).This is pretty decent film. Despite not having almost anything to do with Christmas, and having two of the ugliest women as female leads (one of whom is beyond anorexica dn the other who was born as a man), and having the relatively unknown Danny Kaye overshadow Bing Crosby... it has enough good moments to carry itself. Kaye is really the reason to watch the film. He is the better dancer, possibly the better singer. The ""Theater"" skit is excellent. I could have done without hearing the ""Sisters"" song so many times (though seeing the men perform it was a nice touch -- even if it is not explained how they had the female voices -- were the ladies lip-syncing all those times?).This probably sums up the film, more or less. While it is quite good as a romance or musical, it is not a strong Christmas film. The story could have taken place at any time and it would hardly have mattered. And, as I understand it, this was the third film that Crosby sings ""White Christmas"" in -- so why is this one deserving of the title and not the other two? Hmm.",White Christmas
9,lee_eisenberg,"Stephen Colbert said that the ""Black Christmas"" remake ripped this movie off (PS: the carousels are taking over)",4,22 October 2008,"If you've read any of my reviews of musicals, then you'll know that not only are they possibly my least favorite kind of movie, but that I watch them mainly to heckle them a la ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Among my rude comments this time were: ""You don't think I'm repulsive, do you?"" - Not next to Bob Dole you aren't.(while the old woman is handing out glasses of champagne) ""Champagne?"" - Yes it is.(at the train station) ""Betty left this for you."" - Dear Judy, an alligator bit off my head.As for the sign telling people not to leave cigarette butts and ashes lying around, you just have to blur the scene a little bit to make it say ""butts and asses"". That's an immature thing to do, you say? Well, ""White Christmas"" is a pretty immature movie.As for that comment about Stephen Colbert. When a remake of the horror classic ""Black Christmas"" (considered by many people to be the very first slasher) got released a few years ago, he asserted that it ripped off this movie. In his right-wing commentator persona, he declared something like, if anyone's going to get chased by a psycho killer, it should be Rosemary Clooney. I wonder, would it have swayed his opinion either way to remind him that Rosemary Clooney's nephew stars in movies like ""Syriana""? I should say, however, that George Clooney had a fine-looking aunt.What I mean - as a joke, natch - about carousels taking over is this. A few days ago, I saw the 1956 version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Carousel"" (which I heckled). The next day, I saw ""Carosello napoletano"" (""Neapolitan Carousel"" in English, it was one of Sophia Loren's early movies). Finally, this movie contains numerous references to carousels. Next might there be a movie in which carousels come to life and go all Freddy Krueger on everyone? Yes, I admit that this review barely makes any sense. I just like to do this when reviewing these kinds of movies. I don't like Bing Crosby one bit, while I consider Danny Kaye a genius. But a really cool Christmas movie that I recently saw is ""Silent Night, Deadly Night""; an appropriate one with Halloween approaching. I also recommend the original ""Black Christmas"".",White Christmas
10,jboothmillard,White Christmas,7,7 January 2010,"Bing Crosby's most well-loved and Oscar winning Christmas song came from the film Holiday Inn, it became so popular, director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Mildred Pierce) was given the job to make a whole film out of it. Basically, in World War II, after leaving the army, Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) team up to become successful song and dance stage act, and also manage to get into Broadway as producers. In a night club, Bob is introduced to the Haynes sisters, Betty Haynes (Rosemary Clooney, George's aunt) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) who also sing and dance on stage, who end up following them all the way to a small Vermont lodge. Bob and Phil are really surprised to see their old commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger) as owner of the lodge, but he isn't having much luck with business. They come up with a plan to save his business with a song and dance act they created for Broadway, but brought to the small lodge instead. Obviously things don't go smoothly, there is a rift forming between Bob and Betty, even when they were originally smitten, and happy Phil and Judy try to get them back together. Eventually the whole show is brought together for a big surprise for Waverly as all his soldiers come to the show, and they sing and dance their Christmassy show with the snow falling outside. Also starring Mary Wickes as Emma Allen, John Brascia as John, Anne Whitfield as Susan Waverly and Sig Ruman as Landlord. Some of the dance sequences are fun to watch, and songs like ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"" and ""Geee! I Wish I Was Back in the Army"" are catchy, and the performances are alright. It wasn't a bad film in any way, I did enjoy myself, and I can see why it would be given four stars, but the best part is indeed Crosby's treasured song, for that I would probably watch it again. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep"". It was number 37 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments. Very good!",White Christmas
11,moonspinner55,"Friendly, wholesome, patriotic...and a little bit dead",5,5 December 2009,"A would-be successor to 1942's ""Holiday Inn"", this film begins and ends with ""Holiday""'s Oscar-winning song ""White Christmas"" but otherwise doesn't have much of a seasonal theme. A song-and-dance team, best friends since their Army days, partner themselves with a tuneful and attractive sister act; together, the frolicsome foursome save a dwindling Vermont inn owned by the boys' favorite General (whom they still salute!). Bing Crosby (with his hand on his hip) looks awfully wooden or unsure of himself here, though he works rather amiably with the looser Danny Kaye. Still, there are no romantic sparks between Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, nor Kaye and Vera-Ellen, which causes the love story half of the picture to be left wanting. The colorful production (though a bit elephantine) is lustrous and glossy, and a few of the musical numbers are fun, yet there isn't enough plot on hand to cover two hours on the clock. The final military celebration seems unnecessarily overblown, but the film's technical aspects and choreography are marvelous. ** from ****",White Christmas
12,tavm,Irving Berlin's White Christmas is wonderful holiday fluff for the ages,7,25 December 2007,"To celebrate Christmas and to pay respects to Mr. Bing Crosby who died a little more than 30 years ago, I decided to watch for the first time in its entirety, White Christmas. This movie made of Irving Berlin songs both old and new, also stars Danny Kaye, Vera-Ellen, Rosemary Clooney, Dean Jagger, and Mary Wickes with some familiar bit players like Herb Vigran and Grady Sutton. Also, George Chakiris, best known as Bernardo in West Side Story, is a dancing extra here. The story of two former army buddies-turned-musical-partners who meet a two sister singing act that's on their way to a lodge owned by the general of the former army pals is just a contrivance to put together various songs to fit in certain segments. Good musical performances abound with some of my favorites being ""Choreography"" with Kaye and Vera-Ellen making fun of Jazz-Ballet and the ""Count Your Blessings"" duet with Crosby and Clooney. While I said the story is pretty contrived, I also was mostly willing to go along with most of it as the performers made it all go down easy with director Michael Curtiz lending a brisk pace throughout. The now-classic song ""White Christmas"" was probably better handled in Holiday Inn by Bing some 12 years before but still, it's a good way to both begin and end this wonderful showcase to Mr. Berlin that's become a holiday classic for the last 50 years. P.S.-The picture that Vera-Ellen show of she and Clooney's brother that served with Bing and Danny is that of former Our Ganger/Little Rascal Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer!",White Christmas
13,michaelRokeefe,An innocent yule tide talent tale.,7,25 December 2007,"Legendary Michael Curtiz directs this showcase of talent in an attempt to capitalize on the song ""White Christmas"" that first appeared in the 1942 classic HOLIDAY INN. Quite innocent and evocative of the early 50's mindset. One of those let's save the day by putting on a show. A song and dance team will help keep their former commanding officer's(Dean Jagger)Vermont inn alive. A real talented cast that includes Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen, John Brascia and Anne Whitefield. How can you have Bing Crosby and not hear his ""White Christmas""? Other memorable tunes: ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", ""Count Your Blessing Instead of Sheep"" and ""Snow"".Note: Curtiz four years later would direct Jagger in the Elvis Presley classic KING CREOLE.",White Christmas
14,studioAT,A true classic,7,19 December 2019,"There's a reason why some Christmas films become classics, watched every year without fail.This film is a prime example of that. Well written, well choreographed and performed it's a joy from start to finish.",White Christmas
15,hitchcockthelegend,Still dreaming after all these years.,7,1 January 2010,"Old Army buddies Bob and Phil become a hugely successful song and dance act once the war is over. Taking a much needed vacation to Vermont, they are saddened to find that the ski lodge run by their old wartime General is due to be closed down on account of the lack of snow in the area. Falling in with two lovely sisters, Betty & Judy, the boys plan to put on a variety show with the girls to entice people back to the lodge. But misunderstandings and romantic leanings are not going to make this at all easy.Enduring, perennial, simple and beguiling are all words fit to be associated with White Christmas. It's directed by Mr Reliable, Michael Curtiz, features songs from Irving Berlin and stars Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera-Ellen & Dean Jagger. Filmed in Technicolor, it's also notable for being the first film to be shot in VistaVision (think wide-screen process). In truth the film is thinly plotted and doesn't remotely feature some of Berlin's best tunes, and I dare to be a touch more critical as the VistaVision is wasted on the studio led direction. Yet it's such a charming and heart warming film it feels churlish to let the negatives negate the over riding feeling of having been cheered after a viewing.So although it's not the brilliance it perhaps should have been, it's ultimately a picture that still reels in new viewers every yuletide year, and that's something that is hard to argue with. So enjoy the title song and the likes of ""Sisters,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"" & ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"". Marvel at the zippiness of Vera-Ellen's dancing whilst lapping up the side-kick goofiness provided by the always watchable Kaye. Be emotionally involved with Dean Jagger's heavy hearted General, and of course there's Crosby too, seemingly ageless, he croons and simultaneously manages to melt the ice in your drink as you snuggle up by the fire.Delightful. 7/10",White Christmas
16,jotix100,Merry Christmas thanks to Irving Berlin,7,18 January 2008,"The music of Irving Berlin, one of America's most distinguished composers of the 20th century, is at the center of this pleasant holiday film, that if one is to judge by the comments submitted to this forum, is a perennial favorite of audiences that discover this charming movie, or just go back to visit from time to time.Directed by Michael Curtiz, a versatile man; he was at ease with drama as well as comedy, or musicals. He shows a light touch that helps make this a cherished film for movie fans of all ages. Based on material by another great team, Norman Panama, Norman Krasna and Melvin Frank, the movie is light as a feather. The film is sort of a variation on the theme, ""let's put on a show"", or even, ""if we stage it, they will come"", we know how it will end, but we feel good, and enjoy it even though we know the plot by heart.The main reason for watching, besides Mr. Berlin's wonderful tunes, is hearing those standard songs delivered by the likes of Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, who were at the top of their careers. They had such wonderful and melodious voices, they enhance the songs they interpret. The story is just a pretext to bring together the talented principals plus Danny Kaye, Vera Ellen, Dean Jagger, and the marvelous Mary Wickes, in a film that will delight anyone, anytime, but especially at Christmas.",White Christmas
17,preppy-3,I've never really liked this,5,25 November 2006,"Two old army buddies (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye) are a successful dancing and singing act. They try to help their ex-general (Dean Jagger) from loosing his Vermont inn. The love interest is provided by Vera Ellen and Rosemary Clooney.I've seen this multiple times (once in a brand new print at a repertory theatre)--and I've never really liked it. It starts off great with Crosby singing the title song to soldiers during WWII--that scene really works and is quietly powerful--but then the film falls to pieces. The script is--to be nice--pretty terrible with a totally predictable plot and tired comedy. None of the actors are given roles to play. Kaye seems lost and Clooney and Ellen try to inject life into their characters. Jagger is also far too mild-mannered to play a tough Army general. Only Crosby with his easy-going charm and Mary Wickes (with the few funny lines) really pull off any acting. The songs are pretty unmemorable--""What Can You Do With a General"" has got to be one of the all time worst songs I've heard in a movie. All the sets look impressive--but they're very obviously sets--especially the outdoor ones. And there's no snow or anything Christmas-like until the last 5 minutes! This film does have its good points. It was the first film shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process) and the movie takes full advantage of it with a few elaborate production numbers in bright beautiful Technicolor. Also Kaye and Crosby do have a funny number in drag (sort of) and the beautiful, bright color and some interesting costumes keep you mildly interested. All the singing is good and some of the dancing is just incredible (especially with Ellen).But all in all this is too long (a half hour could have been chopped off), too slow and too badly written for me to like it. Give me ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""Holiday Inn"" over this. I give this a 5.",White Christmas
18,writers_reign,Snow Joke,5,1 April 2009,"Once again I appear to have watched a different film from the majority of posters making it a contest between the hard to please and the easily pleased. I watched it as I watch any and every movie i.e. with the best of intentions and hoping to like more than I dislike. On paper it had plenty going for it beginning with the score. Given that it's a Berlin score we know going in that 1) there will be a healthy slug of his back catalogue melded to a handful of new material and 2) that there's absolutely no danger of us mistaking it for Porter sophistication, Hart wit, Arlen verve and that schmaltz and sentiment will be the order of the day. That's fine. No one's trying to put anything over on us, we know it's going to be The Sound Of Music without the nuns and the kids so let's sit back and let it unspool. Crosby is usually a good bet and when he's teamed with Astaire he's an even better bet. Fred couldn't make it this time around so after trying everyone else they finally settled for Danny Kaye which would also be fine but not, of course, Slyvia Fine, with whose words and music he is most comfortable. It was probably asking too much to expect Kaye to play it straight so we keep getting the Kays schtick whether we like it or not. Rosemary Clooney is adequate as one of the female leads but Vera Ellen has never quite convinced as leading lady material and nor does she here. For acting we have Dean Jagger who is so good he tends to overbalance things. Pleasant? Sure. Engaging? Well ... Painless? More or less.",White Christmas

In courting the girls they go to Vermont, and discover that the hotel they're staying at is owned by their former division commander, Major General Waverley (Dean Jagger). They decide to throw a Christmas show for the General...Quite disappointing, even if watched at Christmas (as I did). I'm not into musicals, generally, and this doesn't ever rise above average as far as the music goes. Most of the songs just feel shoehorned into the movie, ending up with some pretty lame lyrics and scenes. The romance sub-plots felt trite and predictable.On the plus side, the performances are pretty solid. Best of all, the final few scenes are quite emotional, and are what make it a decent Christmas movie. The title song is great too.",White Christmas

22,evanston_dad,One of the Best Bad Movies Ever,7,19 July 2006,"Pour yourself out a nice big boatload of gravy to go with this gigantic slice of holiday ham....I love this movie, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I don't even feel like doing a critical analysis of it, or talking about the acting, or anything of the kind. It's not even a good movie, really, and it suffers from that ugly 50s look from which so many movies from the decade suffered, when they thought the way to compete with television was to build enormous screens and cram them full of saturated color...Michael Curtiz and company make only the barest attempt at adhering to anything resembling a plot, and what plot there is could hardly be called coherent. This film was one of the last gasps of the ""Let's put on a show!"" genre, as well as one of the last shameless attempts to tearjerk a WWII recovering audience into submission.This movie contains more corn than Nebraska, and God love it for that.Grade: A",White Christmas
23,AlsExGal,"The plot is so thin it should have ""No Skating"" signs. But who cares?",8,25 December 2016,"This movie is a Christmas tradition with me. But there is something strange about its allure. It's wonderful between Thanksgiving and Christmas, then on December 26th, it is like the Christmas tree. It turns from a glimmering tribute to the season into a bunch of dead pine needles that you want to haul to the pavement as soon as possible.Maybe that is because there are no bad guys in this film, it is pure good will, pure nostalgia - even in 1954 it was pure nostalgia - nostalgia for the men who had been soldiers in an all out fight for saving the planet from forces of pure evil just ten years before. And it is pure hope - hope for finding that special someone, hope of not being ""the forgotten man (or general in this case), hope that your friends and family care that your life turns out alright, hope for a White Christmas.The great Irving Berlin songs include ""Sisters"", ""White Christmas"", ""Count Your Blessings"", and ""Snow"". The musical numbers are greatly varied including - a minstrel number??? - but then you have a greatly varied cast. There's old pro Bing Crosby whose voice and demeanor warm any film, Danny Kaye's nervous exaggerated presence and Bing's old army buddy and now song and dance partner, Vera Ellen floating on air in all of her dance segments - and look at that waist..if you can find it!. Finally there is iconic 50s songstress Rosemary Clooney rounding out the cast.Dean Jagger plays the general and former commanding officer of Crosby and Kaye who has sunk all of his savings into a Vermont ski inn - except global warming seems to be parked overhead. Then there is great character actress Mary Wickes as the inn housekeeper whose bad habit of eavesdropping on the extension almost throws a fatal monkey wrench into what has up to that point been just been too happy of a film. Remember, if you are going to be an eavesdropper, listen to the WHOLE conversation! Highly recommended as a sugary holiday treat that hits the spot.",White Christmas
24,morrison-dylan-fan,"""I'm dreaming of a..""",7,21 December 2019,"Going to Birmingham for some last-minute shopping for X-Mas presents,I checked to see what was being shown at The Electric (the oldest working cinema in the UK.) Despite having heard the classic title track countless times,I've never had the chance to catch the movie it came from, which led me getting a George Bailey's cocktail,looking out of the window from The Electric at a white Christmas.View on the film:One of three films he made in 1954, even with the film not being played in the VistaVision format, (a recently Blu-Ray finally brings the title out in the correct aspect ratio)the craftsmanship of director Michael Curtiz & cinematographer Loyal Griggs in elegantly composed wide-shots held on the growing bond between the couples.Sparingly holding the X-Mas snowstorm back as bookends glowing in Christmas red, rustic greens and crisp snow scattered across the front of the screen, Curtiz unwraps a Yuletide melancholy atmosphere, snowing down in swift panning shots on Bob and Phil planning how to cheer the General up.Improvising Bing's and Kaye's version of Sisters after the crew saw them both clowning around on set, Curtiz wipes away Winter blues in dance set-pieces brimming with Hollywood glamour of the era,shimmering in Betty and Judy's high-kicking Sisters,and the quartet gathered to sing a closing version of the title track against a picture (Christmas) postcard backdrop.Standing out from the jolly attitudes of the leads, Dean Jagger gives a very good turn as General Waverly, whose shaken post-WWII state inspires others to show warmth and compassion to him. Whilst their ""crowd-pleasing"" double act within the film looks tied and a bit naff, Bing and Kaye lay on the charm in breezy turns as swooning, loved-up pals Bob and Phil. Receiving the swooning from the gents,Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen throw snowballs of sass at the screen as Betty and Judy until they join in with putting up tinsel for a white Christmas.",White Christmas
25,HotToastyRag,This is the Technicolor one,4,2 December 2018,"Let's get the elephant out of the room: Everyone gets Holiday Inn and White Christmas confused. There's no need to be ashamed if you do, since everyone else in America gets them confused, too-that's the only reason we continue to watch them at Christmastime, because we keep forgetting which one is ""the good one"".White Christmas is in Technicolor, and Bing Crosby's sidekick is Danny Kaye. That should help most of you set it apart from Holiday Inn, which is in black and white, and costars Fred Astaire. This one's story involves the troops, and the retirement of head honcho Dean Jagger. The girls are Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen. That should clear things up for the rest of you.Just as with Holiday Inn, there are good parts and lousy parts to this movie, so whether or not this becomes ""the good one"" in your opinion is entirely up to you. The good parts are the adorable Danny Kaye song ""Snow"", the sweet dance number with Vera-Ellen, ""The Best Things Happen when You're Dancing"", and Bing's reprise of his signature song ""White Christmas"". The bad things about this movie are the cross-dressing reprise of ""Sisters"", the original version of ""Sisters"", the rest of Rosemary Clooney's songs, Rosemary Clooney's ridiculous argument that doesn't make any sense, and anything else that involves Rosemary Clooney. Vera-Ellen is beautiful, sweet, is an impeccable dancer, and has a perfect figure-why is another woman even in the movie?",White Christmas

Anyway, I liked White Christmas but only for the ending. It was kind heartwarming and sentimental at times but still you can't beat this cast featuring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera Ellen. Of course, there is romance in the air and a plot to help an old friend out. The film is dated but still beautiful in color and should be seen to be appreciated. Stay till the end of the film when you see those four wonderful stars of yesterday sing White Christmas with the white snow in the background. It's worth watching during the holiday season. Rosemary Clooney used to say that Bing would see her on Christmas Eve. You think they're all in heaven serenading God and the angels with White Christmas.",White Christmas
27,SimonJack,A classic Christmas film and top selling song of all time,10,29 December 2014,"Irving Berlin's ""White Christmas"" movie almost was a classic when it came out in 1954. That's because the title song had been out for 12 years, and was made hugely popular after its first use in the 1942 film, ""Holiday Inn."" It won the Oscar that year for best original song. The song already had broken sales records and was an annual Christmas favorite. So, even with as long as it took 20th Century Fox to make the film, the movie was seen as a sure-fire hit musical and comedy romance. The delay was mostly in trying to fill the role of Phil Davis, played by Danny Kaye. Fred Astaire declined the role and Donald O'Connor became ill just before shooting began. Perhaps providence had a hand in the delay, because I don't think any long-time movie buffs today could imagine anyone other than Danny Kaye in that role. The movie premiered Oct. 14, 1954, and became the top moneymaking film for the year. It had $12 million in box office sales (about $105 million in 2014 dollars). The second highest grossing film that year was ""The Caine Mutiny,"" at $8.7 million. Moreover, the record sales of the song continued to ring up. According to Guinness World Records, Bing Crosby's recording of ""White Christmas"" holds the world record as the best- selling single recording of all time. As of 2014, Crosby's recording tops 50 million, and the total sales of ""White Christmas"" by all recordings tops 100 million. Today this movie endures, along with ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as the two 'must' original films on all lists for annual family viewing over the holidays. Without a doubt, this is the best musical of the season. Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" is the third movie that is on most lists for annual viewing; but viewers have a choice of several different renditions to choose from. Any of four of those are very good. What's not to like about ""White Christmas?"" It's a wonderful story of the early musical play versions where the entertainment is the profession of the stars. The plot is very good, with some sub-plots interwoven. It's a nice romance and light comedy of the everyday life variety. And it has wonderful music, singing and dancing. This film is packed with talent. It has 17 songs – all written by Irving Berlin, and several dance numbers. The songs are a mix of previous numbers and entirely new ones. Several were Berlin hits that are still played today. Some have been used or can be heard in movies in the 21st century. Besides ""White Christmas,"" these include ""Heat Wave,"" ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" and ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me.""Kaye has a couple dance numbers and one with Vera-Ellen who shows her dance talent in several other numbers. Rosemary Clooney plays half of the Haynes sisters act (as Betty) with Vera-Ellen's Judy; and she's also the romance interest with Crosby. Other top cast members include veteran actors Dean Jagger, Mary Wickes and Sig Ruman. Two future stars are in the music and dance cast – Barrie Chase and George Chakiris. ""White Christmas"" has one of the wittiest funny lines of filmdom. Kaye as Phil says to Crosby's Bob Wallace, ""My dear partner. When what's left of you gets around to what's left to be gotten, what's left to be gotten won't be worth getting whatever it is you've got left."" Another good example of the comedic banter between the two male stars is later. Bob is talking about Phil to Ed Harrison (played by Johnny Grant). ""I have complete confidence in him. When it comes to conniving and finagling, you can't beat this boy.""This wonderful film never wears thin for viewing year after year. The songs and dance numbers will always entertain any audience. And the story is a nice holiday tale of friendship, romance, kindness and fun. It's a classic that families will enjoy for generations to come.",White Christmas

29,DKosty123,A Feel Good Holiday Film,7,1 December 2006,"Sadly, it doesn't feel so good that almost every member of the cast & crew of this film is no longer with us, but this work that they have left is very watchable. This film was shot in color & wide screen & it still looks plush & alive even now. The way to watch it is when Turner Classic films is running it in wide screen too. This film is one of the only times Danny Kaye & Bing Crosby worked together & it is a shame it did not happen more. They are delightful in this film. Rosemary Clooney & Vera Ellen are too. This Paramount production was one of the most expensive they produced the year it was released & it was also number 1 in the box office.While the story is very simplistic by today's standards & even when it was released in 1954, it doesn't matter. You put your brain away & enjoy this holiday film as a rare chance to see some veteran performers from the World War 2 era entertain you. There's lots of musical numbers & dancing from the era of the big musical. All of it is well staged, & the music is at the height previous to rock & roll era. If your into old films, go back to the mid-1940's when Bing Crosby did the song ""White Christmas"" for the first time on film in Paramounts ""Holiday Inn"" as there are a couple of comparisons to note. First, Bing sings the song solo in the first film where in this 1954 version the entire ensemble (cast) sing it together. Second, the Holiday Inn is the same set used for the Pine Tree Inn in the second film. Paramount saved some money on sets there. Funny, Crosby gets demoted too in a way. In the first film he actually owns the Holiday Inn where in this film, his former Major-general owns it. The scripts between the 2 are quite different too. Fred Astaire is in the first one in 1942 too. In a way, some folks consider this an inferior remake to Holiday Inn, but to me there are vast differences in the films. White Christmas fits the era it was made, as 1954 was a feel good era where every problem was always being solved. An interesting thing about this film, it incorporates the power of the television media into the plot already in 1954. Most folks then did not realize how far that power would grow into todays national fixation where if something is on TV, too often people believe it as true. Back in 1954, people were still intelligent enough to know when something was not true on its media. That is why you don't care about a strong story line in this film. Everything is fake, but back then fake was fine with people, as long as it was harmless & entertaining.",White Christmas

31,OllieSuave-007,One of my Christmas favorites.,8,17 December 2013,"I am not a huge fan of musicals, especially those made in the 1960s and prior. However, ""White Christmas"" is one of the few musicals I would enjoy, as it always bring in the Christmas spirit in my home. The first time I heard of the White Christmas song by Irving Berlin was actually in this movie.Legendary actors Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye star as two successful song-and-dance actors, who try to save the failing Vermont of their former commanding general (Dean Jagger). In the mean time, they become romantically involved with a sister act, played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera Allen. There is witty comedy and old-fashion romance, provided by the four stars, and scores of toe-tapping musical and dance sequences one after the other.While this movie can be whimsical and some of the musical numbers can drag on at times, the story about the actors going through highs and lows to try to save the inn, with their romantic relationships intertwined in the process, is pretty entertaining to watch. The part where all four sing ""White Christmas"" together is my favorite scene - rich and vibrant in song helped by a children chorus, and a spectacular background containing a large Christmas tree and a beautiful snow scene.Again, I'm not a fan of musicals. But somehow, the Christmas references, albeit brief, made this a pretty enjoyable movie for me.Grade B+",White Christmas
32,llltdesq,Absolutely delightful musical with great performances by the four leads and supporting cast,8,21 July 2015,"This is an Irving Berlin musical featuring Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney. There will be spoilers ahead:This musical is designed as a vehicle for the music of Irving Berlin, starring Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye as old Army buddies, with Kaye saving Crosby's life during the war. The opening musical number takes place during the war in their unit, at the company Christmas show, to celebrate their commander, who's being rotated out of command.Flash forward and the two are now prominent in show business, with a company of their own. The sisters (Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen) of one of the men from their unit contrive to get an audition of sorts when Vera-Ellen sends them a note telling them of their act at a club. Through a series of improbable events (the plot is like cotton candy-sweet but insubstantial) the four wind up on a train together and headed to the same inn in Vermont.The inn is owned by the former commander (played well by Dean Jagger) and the inn isn't doing well, given that there's no snow. Again, through a series of plot contrivances, a show is planned for the inn, with an invitation to the men of their old unit, at least those who can do so, to come up to Vermont to express their support for their old commander.As this is a romantic comedy, the quartet pairs off, Crosby with Clooney and Kaye with Vera-Ellen. The course isn't smooth, but true love wins out in the end. There's a Hollywood ending and all's well in the end.None of that really matters, because the chemistry between the leads is fantastic. Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen look perfect together in ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"", Crosby and Kaye work well together and Crosby and Clooney are perfect as a couple.This film is available on disc and is well worth watching. Recommended.",White Christmas
33,cherold,bad sequel to a mediocre hit,5,29 August 2019,"White Christmas was an attempt to repeat the success of Holiday Inn, once again offering Crosby singing White Christmas and a bunch of singing and dancing.First off, this movie is incredibly dumb. A user review on this site insists, based on a film scholar's work, that we shouldn't judge movie musicals by their level of stupidity, but I feel it's reasonable to ask all genres to put at least a little thought into stories and characters. In this movie, no one does anything that makes any sense. It's lazy, connect-the-dots scripting that relies on constant misunderstandings and hair-pin mood changes.Danny Kaye is surprisingly low-key as Crosby's friend, with none of the bravura musical numbers I associate him with; the closest thing is a wonderful burlesque on modern dance. On the other hand, he's a solid dancer, even if not quite at the Astaire level.Vera-Ellen is a better dancer and does some impressive moves. As an actress she is limited; she only has one facial expression, which is basically that of someone who has had their entire face botoxed.There are a few good numbers, although not enough to make up for the lesser numbers and the terrible story.The movie is a step down from Holiday Inn, which wasn't really that great a movie either.",White Christmas
34,theowinthrop,"Colorful, seasonal remake of HOLIDAY INN",10,11 December 2005,"This was one of the last successful projects involving Irving Berlin. In 1943 he had made the film ""Holiday Inn"" with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, as song and dance partners who split when Crosby decides to leave the act, and Astaire tries to settle down with the woman in the act that both men loved. Crosby turns his farm in Connecticut into an occasional bed and breakfast inn that is opened only on twelve national holidays, and produces special shows for the guests on those nights, with Marjorie Reynolds as his new partner. Astaire (after getting the heave-ho from his girlfriend) shows up with their agent (Walter Abel) and tries to romance Reynolds away from the inn and Crosby.Eleven years later Berlin decided the time was ripe for a remake, and originally planned to have Astaire in it again (it would have been the third Crosby-Astaire film, with ""Blue Skies"" as the center one). Astaire could not be in the film, and eventually the role went to Danny Kaye. One wonders if the original script of ""Holiday Inn"" would have been used or a version of it. As it was, the new film was also set in a New England inn (in Vermont this time), and the story borrows a shade or two from Berlin's World War I musical ""Yip Yip Yaphank as well as his World War II war morale film ""This Is The Army"".Now Crosby is prominent singer and performer who was drafted and is a Captain in a regiment near the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. The Major General commanding is Dean Jagger, although as the film begins he is on the verge of retiring. However, Jagger is present when the men, led by Crosby and assisted by energetic and talented private Danny Kaye, put on a Christmas show. Shortly afterward, Kaye saves Crosby's life when he knocks him out of the way of a collapsing brick wall, and suffers an injury. Crosby, as a promise, agrees to sing a song Kaye composed (as a duet - so Kaye has to sing it too) in his first performance after the war. As a result Crosby and Kaye become partners - eventually becoming like Rodgers and Hammerstein producers of shows as well.They meet a pair of singing and dancing sisters (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney) in Florida, and end up with the girls in the latter's next booking at an inn in Vermont. The inn looks like it should be a success, but it is on the verge of bankruptcy, especially as the temperature has been too hot for snow in December. Also the inn is run by Jagger, assisted by a young granddaughter and Mary Wickes. The plot of the film runs into two slots - will Crosby and Clooney and Kaye and Vera-Ellen get together, and will they be able to Jagger become successful without hurting his pride.The film may have started as a clone of ""Holiday Inn"", but it stands on it's own feet well. There is a nasty taste left in viewing ""Holiday Inn"", with Astaire as bounder - villain willing to break up Crosby's romances because of his own needs. WHITE Christmas does not have that. Kaye is willing to remind Crosby about the act of saving his life from time to time, but he actually is quite protective of Crosby's interests, including hoping to help Crosby settle down with a proper wife (though, oddly enough, he never thinks of marriage himself). Their care for Jagger's plight is also well accepted by the audience. Compare it with Walter Abel's constant looking for some type of long term show-biz contract to take to his clients (especially Astaire: in fact Abel continuously works for Astaire's benefit at the expense of Crosby in ""Holiday Inn""). In short, the motivation of the leads in ""White Christmas"" is far more admirable.The tunes in ""White Christmas"" were actually far more memorable than the ones in ""Holiday Inn"", except for ""Easter Parade"" and ""White Christmas"".They include a revival of the song ""Mandy"" which had been sung in Eddie Cantor's film ""Kid Millions"" in 1937. The one real negative I found was that in ""White Christmas"" the lead-in to ""Mandy"" was a number glorifying minstrel shows. I doubt that African-American today would appreciate that number very much. But at least it was not done in black-face, as the ""Abraham"" number in ""Holiday Inn"" was. Somehow both films would have been different regarding those film sequences today if they were being remade.",White Christmas
35,Robert_duder,I hate reviewing classics especially when it doesn't blow me away,6,19 December 2012,"I suddenly decided to work this epic Christmas classic into my routine this year because I had never seen it. I HATE reviewing classics because who am I to say whether it is good or not because just out of sheer respect and longevity, obviously timeless classics are so for a reason. So I am strictly going by how it made me feel. White Christmas was cute, and it was fun and it certainly has plenty of song and dance routines for those 50's and 60's dance movie fans. The problem is that I just found it sort of ho hum. It never really takes off, I found some of the performances rather sluggish and certainly the pacing for the movie was sluggish. It did not need to be two hours long by any stretch and it just felt like it went on and on with the same concept. Secondly I don't think this really had to be a Christmas movie. Obviously it was built off the insane success of the Christmas song classic ""White Christmas"" but the entire film feels like Christmas is an afterthought and almost forced into the story. It would have made a much better comedy-romance without the Christmas theme.Bing Crosby is a brilliant singer and this is the first time I've seen him acting and honestly I didn't think much. I thought his performance was wooden and monotone a lot of the time until he sang which of course is amazing. The romance focusing on his character felt lost because he just looked so unimpressed most of the time and just really not the acting type I think. He looked even worse next to Danny Kaye who is nothing short of brilliant as the boisterous and loud Phil Davis. Kaye steals every scene between them and is just more comfortable and so much more charismatic on screen. He had some edge about him and some machismo but delivered his lines perfectly. Legendary singer Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen are the sisters that capture the two guys' hearts. They are good, but I just didn't feel like they were great. The chemistry between the four of them was just okay although I thought Kaye and Ellen had better chemistry than the other two. Dean Jagger and Mary Wickes play decent roles but quite small, definitely supporting characters.The dance numbers are splashy and elaborate and fun to watch. However, after the first two you'll feel like you've seen it all before. Even some of the songs just feel like the same thing over and over again. The ending of the film was actually what really got me. It was a great ending and almost brought me to tears which is pretty good considering I thought the rest of the film was just all around average. I love musicals and this one just felt like it didn't try hard enough. But then I have to repeat what do I know because this is a timeless classic that has stood the test of time. I know that this won't make a permanent spot in my Holiday rotation, it just didn't impress me but I would never presume to tell anyone not to watch a classic, it simply didn't impress me at all. 6/10",White Christmas
36,Lejink,Christmas cheer,7,27 December 2009,"You still see it on the DVD racks every year at this time of year and can also guarantee its appearance on TV over the Christmas schedules so is there anyone out there who hasn't seen this old warhorse of a Christmas movie? Well, me for one, so with the snow thick on the ground for the first Scottish ""white Christmas"" in 9 years, what better time to break my duck...Personally I'd have preferred to have seen its predecessor ""Holiday Inn"" with an in-his-prime"" Fred Astaire in the Danny Kaye part, but that will have to wait for another year. Besides I like Kaye and while he gets a few dances alongside Vera Ellen and her impossibly thin legs, he's principally there, of course as a less sour Bob Hope to old Bing's holier-than-thou straight man.The story is of course hokum on a stick but I'll temper any cynicism with the thought of the relevance of the tie-in of Christmas to soldiers to the US cinema-going public of the time, not only so soon after the end of the Second World War, but with the then current war in Korea under way (isn't that always the way with wars, they just keep on coming).The four stars all act engagingly, with good support too from Dean Jagger as the revered major-general and Mary Wickes as his owlish receptionist, although I would carp that some of the song and dance routines are fairly unexciting, the movie does look awfully set-bound and it was a shame to see some fairly obvious lip-sync-hing on the big numbers. I also didn't understand why in the resolution of the misunderstanding of Crosby's motives in staging the big holiday pageant at their old commander's financially ailing resort, the director missed the chance to show the dawning of the truth on ""mistaken messenger"", Wickes, but by the time they ""open up"" the gates to let in the snow and the familiar strains of THAT song by the conclusion, there isn't a dry eye in the house.Irving Berlin's soundtrack is as ever, tuneful and pleasing, with the wit of the lyrics of his ""army"" songs, in particular, highlighting an underrated part of his talent. The photography is beautifully colourful and old maestro Micahael Curtiz unobtrusively and efficiently bringing this slight story to life.All in all, a pleasant release from today's wears and scares and I hope that anyone who watches it in the future gets to do so to a snowy backdrop outside, like I did as it somehow adds to the lustre of the film.",White Christmas
37,richardchatten,How Many People Have Ever Actually Sat Down and Watched This Movie?,6,25 December 2019,"This loose remake in Technicolor & Vistavision of the classic black & white musical 'Holiday Inn' (1942) demonstrates how fast cinema technology had surged ahead in just twelve years, was a big hit, and every year makes TV programmers' work easier by just getting this old warhorse off the shelf and sticking it somewhere in the schedules. Whether amidst the eating, drinking and general milling about that Christmas generally involves anybody actually bothers to sit down to watch it these days is neither here nor there.Danny Kaye (a late replacement for Donald O'Connor) is hardly an adequate substitute for Fred Astaire in the original and Bing Crosby looks a lot older. But the girls (Vera-Ellen & Rosemary Clooney) are gorgeous and their rendition of 'Sisters' delightful (although I wish I could unsee Crosby & Kaye's dragged up reprise of it)!It also has Dean Jagger bringing his usual mellow gravitas to the proceedings (although the less said about ""What Can You Do with a General?"" the better).",White Christmas
38,vincentlynch-moonoi,Bing At His Best!,8,15 December 2014,"And I really mean that. I watch this film almost every Christmas, and let's face it -- Bing is the focus of the film -- and he really was never better. For one thing, watch his face carefully during some of the musical numbers...he's visibly having fun. I'd have to say that at least in terms of film, he was at his absolute peak here, doing rather nicely in the dance numbers, and of course in the singing department.But aside from that, this is one of the best musicals...and it didn't come out of MGM. Paramount did this one up big! The Technicolor and Vista Vision (the first of the latter) are stunning.Despite having a fairly large cast, there are really only 6 main character. Bing and Danny Kaye play a song and dance team that headlined after the end of WWII, but it's especially interesting to see how nicely and sentimentally the battleground scene was filmed. Danny feels Bing is lonely, and is intent to match him up with a woman. Along comes the sister-singers -- Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen (although in reality, Vera-Ellen's numbers are dubbed, in part by Clooney herself!) As with many romantic comedies there are a number of misunderstandings, taking the story from Florida to the winter wonderland of Vermont...where there's now snow. Where they bump into the boy's old General -- Dean Jagger -- now a floundering lodge owner. And his nemesis is housekeeper Mary Wickes.Bing was wonderful in movies, and especially so here. I seriously dislike Danny Kaye as a performer, but I do admire this performance, including his wonderful dance number with Vera-Ellen (""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing""). Rosemary Clooney was delightful in her somewhat spiteful character, but it all ends in romance, with a few spats in between. Her specialty number ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" is terrific. Jagger is at his most ingratiating here, and it was in this general time period that he did some of his best supporting-actor work. Vera-Ellen's dancing is stupendous, and it's easy to see why some consider her the finest of the female dancers.And then, of course, there are the Irving Berlin songs: ""White Christmas"" (which opens and closes the film), ""The Old Man"" (a sentimentally wonderful tribute to the general by Crosby and Kaye), ""Sisters"" (by Clooney & Vera-Ellen, and then hilariously reprised by Bing and Danny), ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" (which includes a wonderful dance routine by Kaye and Vera-Ellen), the imaginative ""Snow"" (with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney & Vera-Ellen), ""I'd Rather See a Minstrel Show""/""Mister Bones""/""Mandy"" (Crosby, Kaye, Clooney,& Chorus; although it shows off Vera-Ellen's legs in a way that betray her anorexia); the timeless ""Count Your Blessings"" (by Crosby & Clooney; just why did Eddie Fisher's recorded version become the hit?), ""Choreography"" (by Kaye, and the one number in the film I despise and fast forward through each year), the sentimental ""What Can You Do with a General?"" (Crosby), and the nifty ""Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army"" (Crosby, Kaye, Clooney & Stevens). I'm not sure there has ever been a better cluster of Irving Berlin songs in any one movie (although, admittedly, some are recycled, including the title song).All in all, a smash film that was the top-moneymaker of 1954, and still wears extremely well. I treasure it!BTW, the Blu-Ray version of this is (for the most part) a real quality transfer...wonderfully vivid.",White Christmas
39,ironhorse_iv,"I was dreaming of a White Christmas, but this musical gave me, little of that. This movie was a bit disappointing.",7,29 December 2016,"Don't get me wrong, this musical romantic comedy film directed by Michael Curtiz certainly is a lovely classical movie, however, it's not much of a 'holiday' masterpiece. For a movie call 'White Christmas', it's barely has any themes to do, with the seasonal event. It felt more like a generic Broadway movie than a Christmas flick with all the theatrical stage song and dance numbers. Filmed in VistaVision and Technicolor, the movie tells the story of male performers duo, Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) & Phil Davis (Danny Kaye) having to team up with sister singers act, Betty (Rosemary Clooney) & Judy Haynes (Vera-Ellen) in order to save a failing Vermont Hotel from going out of business. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I really didn't like, how the plot & sets is mostly a rethread from the 1942's film, 'Holiday Inn'. Originally, the plan was to reunite Crosby with his co-star from that movie, Fred Astaire, but Astaire turned it down, as he had temporarily ""retired"" at the time. Donald O'Connor was cast as Crosby's co-star, in what was hoped to be a reprise of his successful dance partnership with Vera-Ellen from 1953's 'Call Me Madam'. However, that fell through, as O'Connor contracted a severe bout of Q-Fever from his co-star, Francis the Talking Mule, and had to pull out. Danny Kaye was cast as a last minute replacement and he was mixed bag for me. I felt that Kayne was indeed funny, but also his character was a bit annoying. I also felt, a bit weird to see him, fight over the affections of a beautiful up-and-coming performer, when the character seem a bit 'gay'. It made little sense. If that isn't worst, that romantically subplot is nearly a beat to beat to 'Holiday Inn' subplot as well. Even the songs from songwriter/composer, Irving Berlin felt nothing new. After all, this is the third films to feature Bing Crosby singing ""White Christmas"" with the other two being 'Holiday Inn' and 1946's 'Blue Skies'. Don't get me wrong, Bing Crosby is one of the best Christmas themes singers out there, but his songs did get tiresome, after a little while. It felt a bit recycled. Old songs like 'Happy Holidays' also felt, repurposed as new songs. I really don't like, how it became 'Counting Your Blessing'. The same goes with the 'Free' song being rewritten as 'Snow' & ""Heatwave' along others. It really made the film's music seem secondhand and lazy. Plus, it made the film seem like it was a sequel to ""Holiday Inn' when it's not. It was a bit confusing. Yet, there were some moments in this film that didn't seem recycled. According to the accounts of the cast, the ""Sisters"" performance was not originally in the script. They were clowning around on the set, and director Michael Curtiz thought it was so funny, so he decided to keep it. I also like the ""midnight snack"" scene in which Bob Wallace expounds on his theory of what foods cause what dreams. It also was almost entirely improvised. It really did help this movie, a bit. Yet, there were a lot of scenes that didn't, such as the ones featuring Vera Ellen. It was a bit disturbing to see Ellen in a frighteningly thin waist. She looks so weak, due to the illness with Anorexia. You can practically see her gasping through her smile in some scenes. It was clearly shown that she was being dubbed, while singing, because of that. Numerous sources mistakenly assume Rosemary Clooney sang Vera-Ellen's part in ""Sisters"" thus dueling with herself, but in truth, actress, Trudy Stevens was Vera-Ellen's voice double in all of her songs. Despite that, Vera Ellen was given outfits in the numbers ""Choreography"" and ""Mandy"" just to show off her dancing figure, similar to how Rosemary was given more songs to show off her voice. Both actresses were alright in their roles, however, I just felt Vera Ellen should had recast, as she was truly, going through issues at the time. The film would better off, without her. Despite that, the film looks beautiful. The colors are shining, the images are clear, and the rapid movements of scenes, moves without much blurriness. However, the movie was just not as fun, as it could had. Overall: 'White Christmas' was just not that funny, nor the non-Christmas songs, feature in it, memorable. While, a lot of critics might disagree with me. After all, a popular Screen-to-Stage Adaptation hit Broadway, just recently. I just think the movie is highly dated, and a bit overrated. Nothing personal, but 'White Christmas' is purely not as good as it could had. Watch it if you're classic film nut, but clearly watch 'Holiday Inn', during the holiday season if you can. It's the more superior film. Now that's a film, worthy to bring home, during the holidays.",White Christmas
40,redryan64,The Road to VistaVision,6,31 July 2014,"PRIOR TO THE American public's rediscovery of IT'S A WONDRERFUL LIFE and the ascendancy of A Christmas STORY, this WHITE Christmas was the number one Christmas picture. It far outdistanced such titles as FROSTY THE SNOWMAN (UPA), RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER and even SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS and we just can't understand why! Why? IN THE OLDEST and most steadfast tradition of Hollywood, the production crew took various bits and pieces from the previously successful movies and mixed them up a little, hit the plot from a little angle and, ""Presto!"" We have a new film.OTHER THAN THE two elements from the technological guys, there is nothing really new. The scientific guys came up with the wide screen, VistaVision; which was Paramount's answer to 20th Century-Fox's Cinemascope. To this they added the most beautiful Technicolor work imaginable. IN THIS CASE, it was Paramount Pictures that took some of the musical numbers from Irving Berlin's HOLIDAY INN. They then relocated in time and space to a Connecticut resort hotel, post World War II (in approximately real time, 1954). It was placed at that time of year leading up to the Christmas Season.ADDING SOME ROMANCE for the two male leads, Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye, in the persons of Singer Rosemary Clooney and Dancer Vera-Ellen as a pair of sisters, the story had its proper 1950s rationing of titillation and S-E-X.AND WHILE WE'RE on the subject of the principal Male players, we'd like to run this one idea by you. Let's see what you think.WE'VE LONG WONDERED if this was originally intended to be another of Paramount's Bing Crosby/Bob Hope collaborations, you know, maybe sort of like THE ROAD TO YULETIDE, or something like that.IT CERTAINLY HAS all the earmarks!",White Christmas

Waverly (Dean Jagger) who owns a winter resort that has fallen on hard times.So crooner Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye decide to organize their old infantry to all gather at their Major's winter resort and host a real Christmas get together to once again express their love and gratitude to the Major who brought all these brave men home safely.

42,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Best Holiday/Christmas Musical of 50s decade.,8,13 December 2020,"White Christmas (1954) :
Brieflm Review -The Best Holiday/Christmas Musical of 50s decade. In 50s decade there were many Christmas films and Musicals that became popular and also carry huge fan following even today but nothing comes close to White Christmas. Not because it is a musical (We have incomparable Singin' In Rain in 50s) but it is a great film anyways (far better than Gentleman Prefers Blondes) and i wonder why this film is isn't remade several time not only in Hollywood but also in any other industry (mostly Bollywood) as it is a great rom-com too. The plot has everything needed for a perfect Christmas film and even for a perfect Rom com (if you don't like Holiday theme and Musicals) from comedy to romance to conflicts to emotions to positive end. Two hugely popular music artists become romantically involved with two sisters and team up to save the failing Vermont inn of their former commanding general. In 120 minutes it packs all in perfect shape, in a perfect size box and in a perfect wrap. It never looks boring because of engaging screenplay and meaningful musicals which surely gives it high repeat value. While i talk about set up, i don't really think this genre gets anything better than this unless you're looking for a lifetime message of something. But there an army backdrop here which covers the social part and also provides patriotic and emotional feel. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye's pair is at peak of friendship, they create lot of laugh riots, funny moments, tricky gags and melodious musicals while two lovely sisters Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen throws glamour from the other side. Irvin Berlin has given a timeless music but a special mention to the lyrics, especially in those two army songs towards the end. Director Michael Curtiz doesn't show much of class, he keeps it at its simplistic best and succeeds to deliver a Classic film that remains best of the decade among all Christmas films.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",White Christmas
43,matthewssilverhammer,Caucasian Holiday,7,9 December 2016,"Looking for some holiday diversion? Miss the old-days of garishly cozy sound stages? Wanna see ""White Christmas"" sung by its originator? Then by all meanssee Holiday Inn. However, White Christmas, a mild confection of a film, will also do the trick. Coming from a wonderfully different era of film, we get multi-talented performers dancing, singing, acting, and delivering great dialogue, all with a smile on their face. It's a fairly shallow but glamorously fun standard that chugs with charm. Much like director Curtiz's Casablanca, WC exists right on the edges of WWII, with a couple of army vets using their stage presences to woo girls and raise money for their ex-commanding-officer's new hotel. All the performers are clearly enjoying themselves, with Crosby and Kaye respectably matching their annoyed cynicism and wide-eyed mischievousness to enhance each joke and scene. The songs provide much of the charm; while far from totally stellar, the dancing and humor within the numbers are great. What Curtiz really provides is some wonderful gravitas in the war setting, especially in the opening and closing scenes. The general character is a flawless combination of hard-edged soldier and kind-hearted old man. His face in the finale is wonderfully teary-eyed, and it's all done without depressing the mostly joyous proceedings. What does drag the film down are the romantic-comedy annoyances (bad communication, random acts of infatuation, silly logic). At a solid 2-hrs, the film needed some cuts and much of these forced love-tropes should've hit the floor. Still, if you can set aside your cynicism for a night of frivolous American fluff, WC has plenty of charm to keep you humming along.",White Christmas

Crosby and Kaye? Rosemary Clooney looks good and sings beautifully, and Vera-Ellen performs at her usual high-energy level (in several scenes she's paired with George Chakiris for dances that are clearly beyond Crosby and Kaye's skill level).The entire plot of the movie is that the sad-sack Dean Jagger is now sad because he's running a hotel instead of being a general in the army. Crosby and Kaye decide to put on a show to cheer him up, and Rosemary Clooney somehow becomes convinced that they are trying to embarrass him. That's it. Who cares? I guess. The musical numbers are pretty good, mostly dug up from Irving Berlin's endless box of old numbers from his ""Music Box Revue"" days.",White Christmas
45,weezeralfalfa,"Breezy Technicolor, no blackface, reworking of ""Holiday Inn"", lacking Astaire.",9,26 December 2018,"The 3rd musical film starring Bing Crosby, with all music composed by Irving Berlin. Each of those films included the singing of Berlin's classic ""White Christmas"", which was introduced by Bing in the i942 ""Holiday Inn"". In contrast to ""Blue Skies"", and ""White Christmas"", Paramount made the unforgivable mistake of filming it in B&W, instead of Technicolor. This deficiency has since been corrected with an excellent colorized version. Thus, ""White Christmas "" served partly as a reworking of ""Holliday Inn"" in Technicolor, with greater emphasis on the Christmas season.......... Of the 4 original stars, only Bing returned. Danny Kaye made a thoroughly entertaining replacement for the quite different Fred Astaire, who turned down the opportunity to costar once again. Reportedly, he was fed up with playing second fiddle to Bing. Actually, Donald O'Connor was the original replacement for Astaire, but had to bow out do to illness. Singer Rosemary Clooney and dancer Vera-Ellen made excellent replacements for the lesser known female leads of ""Holliday Inn"": Margorie Reynolds and Virginial Dale. Vera-Ellen's 's singing was dubbed. Rosemary quipped that she wished her dancing could have been dubbed........The relationships between the 2 male stars and between the 2 female stars is quite different in the 2 films. In ""Holliday Inn"" Bing and Fred sometimes cooperate, but mostly they compete in their talents and choice of girlfriend. The girls are not cast as sisters, and sometimes compete for roles. In contrast, in ""White Christmas"", Rosemary and Vera-Ellen are cast as loving sisters, rather reminding us of Betty Grable and June Haver, in ""The Dolly Sisters"", released in the mid-40s. Bing and Danny are mostly cooperative with each other. There is no trying to steal the other guy's girl. Vera-Ellen clearly is Danny's girl throughout, with Rosemary as Bing's girl. ........""White Christmas"" is 20 min. longer than ""Holiday Inn"", at 2 hr., perhaps longer than optimal. It was the first film photographed in Paramount's wide screen Vista Vision, which more raised the height of the image than make it wider. This was an advantage when transferring the film to high definition . .......Berlin used a mix of previously composed songs and new songs in both films, as was his general habit....... Notice that the costuming for ""I'd Rather See a Minstrel Show"" did not include blackface, which historically was standard for Minstrel Shows. In contrast, the ""Abraham"" number in ""Holiday Inn"", included much blackface, as well as some authentic African Americans. I thought the blackface was done in good taste, although some object to seeing any blackface in a film.......So, which is better : ""Holiday Inn"", or ""White Christmas"". I'd hate to have to make this choice. Just see them both, preferably both in color. If you like singing and dancing, you won't be disappointed.",White Christmas

Vera-Ellen does some amazing dancing that you won't see on Hallmark or Lifetime in more recent movies.Despite the obvious age difference, Crosby and Clooney have that chemistry. Meanwhile Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen are connecting while their characters scheme because Phil knows that Bob is a ""miserable"" man.Even nearly 7 decades ago, the misunderstood overheard conversation creates the conflict that takes longer to clean up than most of today's movies.A good story, good acting and great song and dance make this movie a classic to watch over and over.",White Christmas

The carefree 50's tone of this film has not weathered the bitter developments of the US and the vinegar of the 70's have taken a lot of the holiday cheer of following these characters.

52,EUyeshima,Thoroughly Entertaining Holiday Classic as Comfortable as a Security Blanket,9,13 December 2005,"Although Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" deserves its place among the pantheon of Christmas movies, this comparative confection from 1954 still deserves special mention. Granted the plot, what there is of one, is rather thin, it is splashy good fun directed by the dependably versatile Michael Curtiz with several Irving Berlin standards and four superb variety performers in their prime. As much as Capra's film is an annual tradition, it is really this film that I look forward to the most of all the holiday classics.The storyline focuses on two former soldiers, Bob Wallace and Phil Davis, both song-and-dance men who become best friends when Davis saves Wallace from a falling building during WWII. After years of post-war success on Broadway and the nightclub circuit, they become reconnected with their gruff but lovable former army commander, General Waverly. The general now owns a Vermont ski lodge, but he is treading water financially since there is no snow as Christmas approaches. As it turns out, the Haynes sisters, Betty and Judy, are playing the lodge during the holidays, and of course, romantic entanglements ensue all the way through the big finale when all four star in a show that they hope will save the general's lodge.All of this seems rather incidental to the musical numbers showcased in the then-revolutionary widescreen process called VistaVision. The most relaxed of actors during this era, Bing Crosby plays Wallace with his natural élan, and he croons the classic title tune early on and leads the group sing of the same song at the end. In contrast, Danny Kaye plays Davis with his mercurial style intact, though compared to his other films of the period, he is relatively subdued here. With her smoky, silken vocal skills on display, Rosemary Clooney plays Betty, Wallace's love interest, with aplomb and complements Crosby easily on ""Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep)"". She also delivers a nice torchy Berlin tune with ""Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me"" despite some silly man-choreography.I have to say the most impressive performer of the quartet is Vera-Ellen, a phenomenal dancer who was the equal of Astaire and Kelly at her peak. She makes even Kaye look good in their musical duets - ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" and the amusing Martha Graham riff, ""Choreography"". However, her best numbers are with dancer John Brascia - the elaborate ""Mandy"" number where her pliable, slender frame seems to be everywhere on the screen, and the brief rehearsal number, ""Abraham"", where she and Brascia snap, pop, clap, kick and swing with unerring military precision. It's worth noting that her singing is dubbed by vocalist Trudy Stevens, which is pointed out by Clooney on the less-than-informative audio commentary track in the DVD package. Much better is the 16-minute retrospective interview with Clooney where her natural sense of humor emerges.There are other numbers worth mentioning in the movie - the duet, ""Sisters"", done first straight by the women and later by the men as a comedy routine in half-drag (Kaye steals this bit handily with his over-the-top clowning); the foursome on the vintage Berlin ""Snow"" and ""Gee, I Wish I was Back in the Army""; and of course, the title tune at the end. Way over on the sidelines, Dean Jagger lends his warm dignity to the role of the retired general, and Mary Wickes plays Emma the housekeeper in her typically sarcastic manner. Special mention needs to be given to Loyal Griggs's vibrant Technicolor cinematography, which makes the entire movie look appropriately like a bright red candy box, and the print transfer in the DVD almost fully captures the original visual quality. This is undemanding entertainment and a dependable holiday classic that feels like a favorite well-worn blanket.",White Christmas
53,MarieGabrielle,A Christmas movie worth buying; nostalgia,10,11 December 2005,"and sentimentalism abound; but it is still a charming and innocent movie, marking the era it was made, 1954. My parents grew up in this era, and I have a remembrance of seeing this film at grandmother's house many, many times.While the story is predictable, it is peppered with musical numbers; interesting cinematography, and believable dialogue. It is also something suitable for young children, as it it creative and sentimental, without being completely saccharine-sweet.Rosemary Clooney is excellent when she sings ""Love, you didn't do right by me""; the staging is very 50's, and kitschy. Bing Crosby is the straight man, Danny Kaye the comic relief; Vera-Ellen is the dance talent. The scenes where they take the train from Florida, to Vermont, hoping for snow, are pure Americana; The set decoration is original and nostalgic.The costumes and set decoration are quaint and somewhat familiar- It gives the audience a feeling of home, and security- Dean Jagger is the retired army general, and his ski lodge in the 1950's is something we all wish still existed, especially for Christmas in Vermont. If you need good Christmas memories, buy or rent this film- you should also let your kids see this while they are still young and not as cynical; it is a Christmas must, the music and dance numbers are very memorable.

54,Steffi_P,"""Like a duck that is dying""",5,8 December 2010,"Here we see one of the later examples of a subgenre that now seems to be extinct – the backstage musical – a song-and-dance movie in which the characters were themselves players in a show, and rather than bursting into song at any given moment, the musical numbers would all be in-context stage pieces. Plots would usually be flimsy and repetitive, and most of the effort would go into spectacular musical presentations. Even though it's now looked on as a rather outdated way of doing things, the backstager gave us many of our finest musicals – the Busby Berkeley pictures of the early 30s, the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers vehicles, and more recently the Arthur Freed production of The Band Wagon. As with any picture, it's all about getting the key elements right or wrong as the case may be.The story of White Christmas is appropriately light, just enough to make an excuse for a string of musical numbers, allow for some romance between the principle players, as well as a bit of post-war nostalgia. It was perhaps this latter that made White Christmas such a big hit in its day, although it's a bit too underdeveloped to really wring out any emotion for audiences who don't have that context. The director Michael Curtiz was never really at ease with the musical genre, instead focusing more on bringing clarity to the story. He makes a rather noble effort, using smooth tracking shots to keep various character story arcs interlinked, but really there isn't enough of a story here to warrant that. And although Curtiz was a master at lifelike and meaningful crowd-shots (as best witnessed here in the final scene) he fails to make best use of the neat Bob Fosse choreography, and just distracts us with a lot of pointless dollying in and out of the musical numbers.Of course, cast matters massively in any picture like this, and Bing Cosby is always welcome – a wonderful singer as well as a fine actor. But he's underused on both counts here, appearing older, tired, and without the spark that he brought to his pictures in the 30s and 40s. Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen make lacklustre support, each one of them looking like second choices (which was more or less actually the case). Here and there is a hint that Clooney might actually be a great dramatic actress. If that's the case she's wasted here. On the non-musical side of things, Dean Jagger surely has the most important job as an actor, as he has to carry that poignant strand in the picture. Fortunately he manages this with naturalism and sensitivity. Beady-eyed musical fans may also spot a promising young George Chakiris (Bernardo in West Side Story) as a backing dancer in a couple of numbers.The title of this picture would naturally have us thinking of this as a Christmas movie. However, despite its theme it really lacks the cosy, glowing feeling of It's a Wonderful Life, Miracle on 34th Street, or even the less openly Christmassy Holiday Inn, in which the title song was first heard. But here White Christmas (the song) just comes across as another little presentation – it's far from being the heart of the picture. Irving Berlin was one of the finest songwriters ever to lend his talents to Hollywood, but unfortunately White Christmas (the movie) sells him short.And on that unseasonably gloomy note, here's wishing all IMDb users a merry and bright Christmas ;)",White Christmas

Granted, the singing and dancing is inoffensive entertainment if you put it on and watch it once. And I'm only human so I'm not going ot complain about seeing Vera-Ellen dance. But let's be honest - Rosemary Clooney had a face for radio. And Danny Kaye has far better movies on his resume.
I don't even want to get into how offended I am about how the trite opening scene - a cheap Hollywood soundstage featuring Crosby singing the title song to what are supposed to be combat troops.

I know that after ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Carol"" ""White Christmas"" must be one of the best known Christmas theme movies. For some reason I avoided this movie. I think I did see parts of it over the years but it never held my interest. It had to be 30+ years since I last saw clips from the film. Now in 2017 I finally saw it all the way through and I am glad I did. Its a fun film but, not great film. I think however the older you are the more you will enjoy it. On Christmas Eve, 1944, somewhere in Europe, two World War II U.S. Army soldiers, one a Broadway entertainer, Captain Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby), the other an aspiring entertainer, Private Phil Davis (Danny Kaye), perform for the 151st Division. But, word has come down that their beloved commanding officer, Major General Thomas F. Waverly (Dean Jagger), is being relieved of his command. He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell.Years later they run into the General who now own & runs a resort. The resort is struggling. They vow to help save his resort. The film is well worth seeing. Rosemary Clooney was a great singer and she shines in this. Watching Vera Ellen dance is worth the purchase of a DVD. Now if you are under 30 you might not like this. However the older you are the more you understand the motives of the people in the film. Don't miss this!",White Christmas
58,mike48128,"A great musical but not a sequel to ""Holiday Inn""",8,30 December 2012,"White Christmas succeeds in spite of all its shortcomings and inconsistencies! That's because it is filmed in ""breathtaking"" Technicolor and the then-new wide screen process of ""VistaVision"". (Next used in ""10 Commandments"") Also, the soundtrack is an early attempt at hi-fi stereo, involving both magnetic and optical elements.O.K. the story is wafer-thin: A successful song and dance team travel from Florida to Vermont because Danny Kaye plays matchmaker for Bing Crosby. They happen upon their former Army general who now owns a Vermont ski resort on the verge of failure due to no snow and no business. So, naturally they bring their entire New York Broadway show up there, at great expense so the general will be a success. A grist mill and barn are transformed into a theater. A full set of lights and rigging are installed. (Sure, anyone can install a full set of counterweights for curtains and scenery--it's a snap!) The barn's ""stage"" seems to grow and swell to double it's original size for the grand finale. The songs range from iconic to inane. The worst: ""Choreography"" and ""What Do You Do with a General...?"" The awkward: ""Mandy"" and ""Abraham"" are ""minstrel"" numbers done without blackface make-up. Several great songs: ""Count Your Blessings"", ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing"", ""Snow"", ""White Christmas"", and more. Several ""cameo"" performances including the funny and beautiful Barrie Chase. (""Mutual,I'm sure"")Why does this film work? Well, Vera-Ellen is fantastic, sexy, and wow!...can she tap dance! Michael Curtiz is a brilliant director. The cast is fabulous. Most of the production numbers are great and the film plays like a variety show--uneven, but with some real showstoppers along the way.Production shortcomings: Filmed almost entirely indoors on soundstages, the battlefront scenes look entirely artificial. Vera-Ellen is painfully-thin, so Edith Head costumed her in over-sized clothes and bulky sweaters. Bing is almost the same age as the general. Why couldn't they get the ""real"" Ed Sullivan? The ballet children in the finale look unhappy. (I suspect a very long production-day (or days) with several re-takes.)Amazingly filmed in only three months, a great movie musical anyway! Fun to watch if you don't take it too seriously. A beautiful presentation which has made millions for Paramount in video sales.Holiday Inn (now available well-colorized) is actually a better film with better songs. (In that film, Bing Crosby is on the verge of bankruptcy because his dinner-show inn is failing.) Note: Fred Astaire ""passed"" on ""White Christmas"" because he didn't like the script. He was almost right about that!I boldly compare ""White Christmas"" to ""Xanadu"" which both have an irrelevant and weak premise but several ""legendary"" musical numbers.",White Christmas
59,LeonardKniffel,"Dated, Infuriating, and Inexplicably Enjoyable",8,27 April 2020,"One of the hokiest and most dated musicals of all time, this is also one of the most watched. Why? First, there are the songs by Irving Berlin, starting with the title song, which by 1954 was already a standard, having been introduced a dozen years earlier in ""Holiday Inn."" Then there is the great voice of Rosemary Clooney, who, as was the practice in 1950s films, is paired with Bing Crosby, a love interest way old enough to be her father, and their break-up/make-up scenes are just tedious. None of it really matters; it's all just a trick to get everybody to sing and dance and clown around. Danny Kaye, who can be really cloying on screen, is at his best in this film, all tongue-in-cheek. His mockery of the song ""Sisters"" with Crosby is hilarious. Dean Jagger's portrayal of the General has probably done as much for Memorial Day as anything this film has done for Christmas. A real time capsule. --from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",White Christmas
60,nancyldraper,"My all time, favourite, Christmas movie",10,29 December 2018,"This is my all time, favourite, Christmas movie. Not to be confused with HOLIDAY INN (which is also a favourite) just because it has Bing Crosby and the music of Irving Berlin (and a revamp of the set of the Inn), it has a different story line and a different dynamic. HOLIDAY INN was a song (Berlin/Crosby) and dance (Astaire) production, WHITE CHRISTMAS is both of those items (sub in Vera-Ellen and some outstanding male dance partners) but also has the pure tones of Rosemary Clooney, the comedic genius of Danny Kaye and Mary Wickes, stunning ensemble choreography, a beautiful love story (or 2), a heartwarming premise and the advent of VistaVision, which was an innovation in colour and clarity in film (a fledgling technology that was a precursor for today's HD quality).

61,Sirus_the_Virus,You can't deny that it's good.,8,28 November 2009,"Irving Berlin's White Christmas is a classic. You can't deny it. Until I run out of them, I am going to be writing reviews for Christmas films. I have already done a few. But here I am, reviewing White Christmas starring Bing Crosby and Rosmary Clooney. I am going to make this review nice and short. This isn't my favorite Christmas film. It is a good film, but I can't call it the best. I think my favorite is Scrooged with Bill Murray or even Jim Carrey's Christmas carol. Who knows? A lot of Christmas films are pure cheese. Watch Jingle all the way and Christmas with the Kranks and you'll know. Of course you could call Die hard a Christmas film. This is a Christmas film but when I first saw it I was really in the Christmas spirit until the very end. Because it didn't really seem Christmasy. I know that isn't a word. Though the film is a classic, I don't love it. But it's a good film, no doubt about it.White Christmas:***1/2 out of ****",White Christmas
62,inspectors71,My sap runneth over,7,18 December 2005,"If ever there was a ""guilty pleasure,"" it's Bing Crosby's White Christmas. From the sappy story line to the half-baked songs, this thing truly is mediocrity writ large.But it works! There's just such a prevailing aura of niceness in White Christmas that, except for the beatnik dance sequence where I always fast-forward, I can't stop loving the simple, guilt-ridden pleasure of this sweet contrivance.WC is a professional joy, wrapped with a big, fat holiday ribbon, that continues to make me smile some 37 years after I first saw it.My fifth grader loves it, too. Not a bad recommendation for a movie panned by the critics, both professional and amateur, of which I am one.",White Christmas
63,bobsgrock,Surprisingly cold... for a Christmas movie.,7,27 October 2009,"Bing Crosby is certainly one of the finest singers of the 20th century and he was simply charming and magical as the priest in Going My Way. However, he seems terribly miscast as a workaholic showman in this tale of two ex-army pals who decide to help out their old general by doing a show at his winter lodge in Vermont that is starting to tank. Of course, Crosby sings and he is great, but as an actor his face is quite expressionless and he seems very stiff with the other actors.The comic relief to his straight man is Danny Kaye, who comes off more as whining and annoying than funny. They do sing and perform well together, but I got tired of him rather quickly. The ladies are Rosemary Clooney and Vera Allen, again both good at dancing and singing but needed help in the acting department.One other thing that bothered me about this movie is that it didn't seem to have the warmth and sincerity most Christmas movies do. Films like It's A Wonderful Life penetrate deep to our feelings and really make us care for the characters and their situations. This story feels more like a complete set-up in order to get these four to sing and dance. Even then, I wasn't real impressed by the numbers, particularly one rather unnecessary one that feels taken right out of Monty Python.I would still recommend others to see it if only for the final act which is both emotional and lovely. But, I think it is safe to say that this does not need to be considered a traditional holiday viewing like It's A Wonderful Life or A Christmas Story.",White Christmas
64,jhclues,"SNow, sNow, snOw, snoW, SNOOOOW!",10,25 November 2001,"The spirit of Christmas is alive and well in this delightful musical which features a number of songs, as well as an original score by Irving Berlin, entertainingly presented by the crooner, the comic, the singer and the dancer-- and not necessarily in that order.  It's `White Christmas,' directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen.  One of the most popular films of 1954, it opens and closes with the title song, while in between it's filled with one great musical number after another.  It's just after the Second World War; the popular General Waverly (Dean Jagger) has retired to run an inn in Vermont, while a couple of his men, Captain Bob Wallace (Crosby) and Private Phil Davis (Kaye) have gone on to fame and fortune in show biz.  During a Christmas break from their successful show in New York, Wallace and Davis follow an up-and-coming act known as `The Haynes Sisters' (Clooney and Vera-Ellen) to Vermont, where they discover their former commander is in trouble; there hasn't been any snow this year, and no snow means no business at the inn for General Waverly.  But not to worry; with Wallace and Davis on hand, as well as the Haynes sisters, the General's problems are as good as solved.  It's just a matter of figuring out exactly how to go about it, which-- and, of course, it's not much of a surprise-- they do.  And along the way the audience is treated to some spirited and memorable production numbers.  They just don't make em like this any more, and it's a shame. Because this is pure entertainment, and one great show.	Veteran director Curtiz, who directed his first film in 1912 in his native Hungary, consistently demonstrated his versatility again and again with films ranging from `Yankee Doodle Dandy,' `Life With Father' and `Casablanca,' to later fare such as `King Creole' in 1958 (which starred Elvis Presley).  And with this one he certainly proved that he knew his way around a musical.  Granted, it was hard to go wrong with Crosby, Kaye, Clooney and Vera-Ellen on board, but there's a big difference between delivering a finished product and making a great movie; and this one definitely falls into the latter category.  The story is solid, and Curtiz makes the most of the talent at his disposal.  Bing is at his best, and the antics of Danny Kaye are a joy to behold, as are the delightful song stylings of Rosemary Clooney.  But with all that talent on hand, the single element that truly takes this film to that higher plateau is the presence of the perky and winsome Vera-Ellen.  	Thought by many to be the best dancer ever to be a part of the studio system, Vera-Ellen is an absolute delight in this film.  Though she couldn't sing (her singing was dubbed by Trudy Stevens), what she could do on a dance floor more than made up for it.  Whether it's the `Sisters' number with Clooney, one with Danny Kaye or just with the guys in the chorus, she is mesmerizing to watch.  It may be a style that defines another era, but when she's dancing-- like Gene Kelley-- it's a timeless proposition and becomes entertainment that belongs to the ages.  It's just such a joy to watch someone like Vera-Ellen do what she does best.  It's transporting.  And when you consider that she is but a part of the equation here, it's easy to understand why this film remains so popular to this day. 
	The wonderful Danny Kaye gives a terrific performance here, as well.  It may lack one of the tongue-twisting numbers he was famous for, but he still has ample opportunities to showcase his many and varied talents, which he most certainly does.  There was never any question that this was Bing's picture, but he couldn't have asked for a better second banana than the charismatic Kaye who, like Vera-Ellen, is virtually spellbinding when he's doing what he does best, which is just about anything he does in this film, whether it's singing, dancing, mugging or just throwing out a line to Crosby.  	Clooney's part may not be as flashy as those of her co-stars, but she sure can sell a song, and whether it's a solo or a duet with Bing or Vera-Ellen, there's no doubt that it's another of the many strengths of this film.  And she mixes well with the laid-back Bing who, though clearly the star of the show, demonstrates his generosity as an actor by always allowing and never begrudging his co-stars their time in the spotlight.  Crosby was a star and he knew it without having to prove anything; he also knew there was plenty of star dust to go around, and because he let it his movies (this one included) were all the better for it.  	The supporting cast includes Mary Wickes (Emma), John Brascia (Joe), Anne Whitfield (Susan), Richard Shannon (Adjutant), Grady Sutton (General's guest), Herb Vigran (Novello), Johnny Grant (Ed Harrison) and Percy Herbert (Train Conductor).  Thoroughly entertaining in the truest sense of the word, `White Christmas' is an engaging, enduring and uplifting film that will whisk you away to a magic place in your heart and in your mind.  It's so refreshing to take this journey to a time that may not have in reality been any easier, but at least seemed simpler and somehow less convoluted than our present era of `political correctness.'  A time in which films like this one were not only able to be made, but were subsequently welcomed and embraced by audiences everywhere.  Today, we have `Harry Potter,' a new kind of magic and a great film in it's own right; but there will always be a place for Bing and his bunch, because theirs was a magic all their own, the kind that's lasting and immortal.  And it's all a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",White Christmas
65,FilmOtaku,A sentimental and nostalgic favorite,5,28 December 2003,"It's really difficult for me to apply my usual criticism to White Christmas because doing so is kind of like spitting on a national monument.  This film is so harmless and revered that it can't really be seriously judged against usual criteria.  It is a fun and cute musical comedy, and it is really corny unrealistic but then again so were most musicals in the 1950's.  Add a heavy dose of Christmas cheer and you have what is probably one of the most loved Christmas movies of all time.  One thing I can commend it for is that although it is essentially a remake of `Holiday Inn', they blessedly didn't stoop to the god-awful level of the `Abraham' number at any time during the film.  I also cannot help but laugh every time I see Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye's rendition of Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen's `Sisters' act.Sure it's corny and saccharine, and yes it has some really mediocre musical and dance numbers, but White Christmas does indeed succeed at what it seemingly sets out to do:  Instill nostalgia for care-free times and engage even a little bit of the `Christmas Spirit' in most viewers.  (How can Bing Crosby singing `White Christmas' not make you at least a tiny bit sentimental?)  Besides, at the very least, you can marvel at Vera-Ellen's five inch waist and the fact that Bing ALWAYS looked sixty.--Shelly",White Christmas
66,Isaac5855,"Hands down, my favorite holiday movie...",8,16 April 2007,"WHITE Christmas is the classic re-working of the 1942 film HOLIDAY INN, which follows the story of Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Phil Davis (Danny Kaye), army buddies who later become a successful showbiz team who find themselves helping out their retired commanding officer (Dean Jagger) who now owns a run down Vermont Inn and falling for a sister act at the same time. This colorful and entertaining musical has been a favorite of mine since childhood. I was unable to go to sleep on Christmas Eve until I watched this...now they hardly ever show it on Christmas Eve anymore. Crosby and Kaye make a great team and they receive great support from Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen as the Haynes sisters. Mary Wickes garners some big laughs as the general's housekeeper and future Oscar winner George Chakiris can be spotted in a couple of production numbers. Musical highlights include ""Sisters"", ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"", ""Count your Blessings"",'Choreography"", and of course, the title tune. Some consider this film the bastard stepchild to HOLIDAY INN, but I absolutely love it and can watch it over and over again.",White Christmas
67,alice liddell,"It would take a Scrooge to dissent, but...humbug!",6,12 January 2000,"It is sad to see a once sharp talent flab out into harmless amiability and compromised flatulence.  Michael Curtiz was never a great director in the way Hitchcock or Hawks were - he never stamped his own mark on the material he was given.  But he was an inventive craftsman, always prepared to enliven and sometimes deepen the most generic of subjects with pace, good humour, an inherent sense of drama and elegantly complex camerawork.  The hothouse intensity of MILDRED PIERCE seemed to exhaust him, and after a decade of brilliance, which included THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD and CASABLANCA, he settled down to untiring hackwork, which, while easy on the eye, was indifferent to inspiration or interest.WHITE CHRISTMAS is better than most, its predictability and dubious ideology made palatable by likeable leads, the title song, and a plot with a degree of complication.  The opening sequence is a bit of a pleasant surprise.  In the middle of of a shell-shocked wilderness during World War Two, Captain Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Private Davis (Danny Kaye) are entertaining the troops with energetic, Christmas Eve vaudeville on a makeshift stage.  A group of senior officers drive up; the incoming general deplores the lack of discipline and demands that the soldiers are prepared for inspection.  The outgoing general Waverly (Dean Jagger), a soft-hearted grouch, gives him wrong directions to extend the show a little bit, and after some manly sentimentality, Bing sings 'White Christmas'.  The straining for pathos is obvious, objectionable and irresistable.  Later, during a bombing, Davis accidentally saves Wallace's life.  The latter is a famous singer in real life; Davis calls in the favour so that they become a double act.The war over, Wallace and Davis become a huge success, first as performers, than writers, than producers.  Immensely rich, but lonely, Davis keeps trying to set Wallace up with bimbos.  Tricked into watching a sister double act, Betty and Judy Haynes (Rosemary 'aunt of George' Clooney and Vera-Ellen), the pair become smitten, and an extended double romantic plot ensues, with all the usual, enjoyable twists and turns.  This is bound up with a putting-on-a-show plot, when our heroes try to help Waverly, who has bought a snowlodge in a Vermont that stubbornly refuses to snow.It would take a more cynical viewer than me to reject this cosy fun.  There is something very traditional, almost Shakespearean about the film, in which plot and incident are subordinated to the celebrating of the titular feast day.  In this way, WHITE is less a narrative than a pageant, in which difference and difficulty are set up only to be ironed away in a finale of reconciliation.  It is a strangely secular pageant though; spirituality or the birth of Christ don't get a look in - this film, as much as Coca Cola, embodies the very American dereligioning (sic?) of this most fundamentally religious of festivals.There is much that is difficult in this.  It IS a very white, exclusionary Christmas, that only has room for the talented, beautiful, rich, heterosexual (even if Bing and Danny go ill-advisedly drag) and white.  This is only to be expected in a Hollywood film of the 1950s, and WHITE is a highly revealing marker of American ideology of the era, and, through nostalgia, our own.  What is worse is that this is all underpinned by a celebration of the military, which is hard not to see as a sycophantic tribute to President Eisenhower.  Early on, Wallace joked that it would be impossible to find a Democrat in Vermont - this had seemed like mild satire; by the end of the film, it's a relief.  The militarism isn't scary a la Riefenstahl; the soldiers are regular Joes, shabby, jokey.  In WHITE's penultimate number, the easy-going army life is favourably compared to the vicissitudes of real life, but this only normalises and makes acceptable the uncriticised adoration of the military that the plot crises work towards.  In the same way, the seeming criticism of capitalism in Wallace and Davis' unselfish deeds only serves to vindicate it.  Only capitalism can afford to be philantropic enough to achieve the selflessness it does.As a musical, the film is a complete failure.  Its critique of the American need for performance to conceal reality is half-hearted, while it admits that its own power as a genre has been much diminished by the emergence of television, which, strange for a 50s film, is not an object of fear.  WHITE is little more than an excuse to string together some Irving Berlin numbers, few of which are very memorable, and many of which sound like advertising jingles.  Curtiz directed one great musical - YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, a model of vibrant invention - but is completely lost here.  Although made at Paramount, WHITE bears all the marks of a Fox musical - vulgar sets; flat compositions; dull rendering of movement; the substitution of noise and clutter for originality and style.  MGM were the only studio in the 1950s who could make musicals - Minnelli used sets and colour to create emotional depth; Donen had a way of pulling off the most elaborate sequences with clarity and truth; Gene Kelly burst forth with vigour and ideas.  A second-rate MGM musical puts everything here to shame - all the big dance numbers are lumbering because Curtiz does not know how to film them.  The two male leads are fine: Crosby has an inoffensive croon that puts you at ease, even if you'd never listen to it as MUSIC; he is a relaxed comedian in whose company you don't mind spending a couple of hours.  At the risk of losing my cool, I have always adored Danny Kaye, his physicality, his facial movements, his voice and vocal gymnastics, his versatility.  He is totally wasted here - the one or two sequences (eg the fall down the stairs) showing what might have been.  The girls are bores, but could it be any other way. I watched this on Christmas Day after dinner and it was perfect.  I don't think I could have swallowed Tarkovsky.",White Christmas

73,eabakkum,"Christmas in the domestic circle, in the dark days",8,31 December 2011,"White Christmas is one of the few films without faults. It is a pleasure to watch, and as the cover of my DVD says a lovely classic,in which dreams come true. The events work out well, in a credible way. Since the narrative unfolds in show business, all passions can be readily supported by magnificent sing- and dance-acts. The atmosphere of Christmas is captured extremely well, with Christmas trees, holly, snow, bells, Santa Claus costumes, and a cozy fireplace. Don't expect any references to the little child Jesus. The theme is the power of the old-boys network, in this case the strong bonding between the soldiers of a company, that fought during WW2. The general is a real peoples manager, and is adored by (most of) his subordinates: ""We'll follow the old man wherever he wants to go"". After the war he starts a hotel business in Vermont. Since he can use some publicity, his former subordinates Bob Hope and Danny Kaye, who are successful entertainers in show business, decide to do their rehearsals in the hotel. In addition they organize a giant reunion for the company there. It is actually not a dream, but good fun and nostalgia and re-bonding. On their way Hope and Kaye meet two sisters, Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen, and all experience love at first sight, in a compatible way. Even this is credible, considering the reputations of Hope and Kaye. In short the general, the four stars and the audience have a wonderful and self-assuring time. Luck reaches its climax, when suddenly the snow starts to fall. Snow in Vermont, this ensures a busy season for the generals hotel. Will the dream continue? Will luck last? Who knows? The hotel may well establish itself. Concerning the relations between Hope-Clooney and Kaye-Ellen I am not so sure, because from the start they look a bit shaky. But don't worry, thanks to their networks replacements will soon be found. All in all, the film White Christmas is a lovely film to watch in the domestic circle, during the darkest days of the year.Will the film itself last? The small number of reviews is astonishing. But it is indeed mainly the film of my parents, in a time when music and dance were still appreciated by the cinema spectators. Perhaps at that time the people craved for simple happiness, after the Depression and the war. I have inherited a liking for musicals and operas, but clearly the genre has become obsolete, at least in this shape. Modern people get bored by an indulgent narrative, that is devoid of any lessons of life. They expect drama or satire. It may well be, that White Christmas is a product of its period, that can not stand the judgment of time, and is eventually banned to the archives.",White Christmas
74,Catharina_Sweden,"Good fun, but not one of the great Christmas Tales",7,30 December 2014,"This is one of the old famous classic movies, that one ought to have seen at least once. It is lavish with many extras, wonderful costumes, big song and dance numbers - the best of course being the very fine end number when they perform the title song - etc..Apart from that, this Christmas movie is not at all in league with the great Christmas movies that one can watch year after year without tiring, such as ""The Bishop's Wife"". There is no deeper message here, except I suppose some general ""one should help each other out""- thing. The main story is too silly, and so are the two love-stories, the ending is too predictable, and apart from the title number there is not really much Christmas spirit to it.I find the two women entertainers very mediocre and uninteresting, and it does not surprise me that they never became great stars on par with their male co-actors. Danny Kaye is fun to look at I suppose, but I have never been a fan of him. Bing Crosby is the only one who lifts this production! He is as always very likable - he seems so decent and wholesome, and you become glad and full of hope when you see him. (Of course I have no idea if he was such a wonderful person in reality.)

75,daoldiges,Tough Going Despite Fun Musical Numbers,6,28 November 2020,"So Thanksgiving Day 2020 I decided it was about time I gave WC a viewing. I'd overlooked it for so many years I was kind of looking forward to it. I really did enjoy the musical numbers, Vera Ellen is a great dancer. Rosemary Clooney is also good with her musical performances too and their costumes throughout were lovely. Danny Kaye certainly has his moments. As for Bing, he sings beautifully but I felt like the rest of his performance was on cruise control and was actually quite distracting and brought the film down. It was a battle to get this film off the ground anyway what with the plot line being as thin and vapid as can be. I'm guessing that if I had first seen this film during my youth, as I suspect many reviewers of this film have, then I too could still have great affections for it here in the 21st century. However, that is not the case for me and I have to admit to having a hard time finishing. Despite my not so favorable review I am still glad that I finally gave it a try and if you're someone like me that has always been curious about it, then I suggest you check it out and see what you think.",White Christmas

78,coolantic,Contrived,4,18 November 2019,"This film is a bit of con job, built around a song, or song title; it turns out to be a simple box-ticking exercise. It can be argued there are good reasons to watch it. Four established stars of musical cinema, some great songs and dance routines. It's in Technicolor and, it's got Christmas in the title.
Alternatively, it's a weary, hackneyed chugger, piggy-backing on the then popularity of Hollywood musicals, recycling old songs mixed with pathetic new ones with too many drop-of-the-hat dance routines. And schmaltz is poured on by the bucketful.
As mentioned elsewhere, the movie has little to do with Christmas. The title is simply a hook. The absurd devotion to the Army will appear strange to modern audiences as will the minstrel show number. Although at least they didn't perform in blackface! Thankfully we are spared Danny Kaye's usual facial contortions and silly voices (did he perhaps inspire the likes of Robin Williams and Jim Carrey?) but the ""drag""version of Sisters is simply embarrassing. Kaye seems comfortable in the routine. But Crosby seems very anxious to want to let us know that ""This is just a gag folks!""

79,kyle-cruse,Great musical,9,29 January 2009,"""White Christmas"" is truly one of the most underrated musicals of all time. Although it is really not that unique for a film or a musical of its type, I found it completely enjoyable nonetheless, even more so than most musicals I've seen. By this time, the song ""White Christmas"" had become so popular that a musical about it would simply have to be made. This film is about as funny as an musical of its type, with scenes such as Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye dressing up as women to fill in for the ""Sisters"" act. I love the music as well. The title song is important of course, though the film includes one of my personal favorite songs, ""Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep,"" a meaningful, inspiring, and beautiful song that is unforgettable. It's a great holiday film that will make you feel good, guaranteed. It's touching, fun, and nearly perfect.***1/2 out of ****",White Christmas
80,bmiller59,They Don't Make 'em Like They Used To,10,28 December 2019,"Don't know what I can add that hasn't already been said, but, here goes. I've been watching White Christmas since late '70's when I first saw it on a big 25"" Magnavox console. I was mesmerized by Bing and Danny. When it was released years later on VCR tape I bought it and enjoyed it at my leisure. I then got familiar with all the other characters and enjoyed it more every year. I've had a DVD for years and it may wear out one of these days. There is nothing in White Christmas that does not disappoint. Music, dancing, choreography, story, all of the players in this movie keep giving year after year. My favorite character though is General Waverley. I still after all these years get emotional when he makes his first appearance as the ""innkeeper"" and the last scene. This is the only Holiday movie that I watch every year. I'll sprinkle in some others, rotating other classics and current HM movies. White Christmas is a must.

81,Matthew_Capitano,Um. . . . . . yeah,4,5 January 2015,"Not-so-hot remake.Danny Kaye makes Bing Crosby look like dog food in this tired Christmas contest of dullness and dance numbers. Some very misplaced arrangements, like 'Choreography', are coupled with a jumbled story about a retiring army general to bury this holiday film in a dirty stocking under a dead tree. Kaye and Vera Ellen are good, but Crosby and Rosemary Clooney thoroughly stink. Whoever told Crosby he could dance? Like the slow and sloppy Gene Kelly, Crosby's lame dancing belongs on the back of a truck to be carted out in the woods somewhere and dumped.There are much better Christmas films to watch; this one is for fans of the stars only.",White Christmas
82,arthera09,Me love Bing,8,21 January 2009,"I am not sure I can express how much I love Bing Crosby. I am not really familiar with him, but the more I experience the joy that is Bing the more I love him. I think this is such a great time period for him. He is a little older so he has a bit of wisdom to him that only a weathered face contains, but he stills has enough energy to pull off some pretty nice dance moves and has an on screen energy that just does not exist anymore. My favorite scene in the whole movie is near the beginning when Crosby and Kaye go back and forth after the show and it is pure magic. The energy and dialog has rarely been match in my eyes. Granted my eyes are young and have seen a lot of the greats, but what a great scene. I love this movie and it makes me feel good. It is a Christmas movie for me and I could not watch any other time of the year, but it is a fun movie. I loved the dance and musical sequences and watching Vera-Ellen dance is quite a site. That women is more legs than anything else and she can move. I could immediately tell who the singers were and who the dancers were, but I did not mind. Everyone has a great dynamic with each other and it is so much fun to watch. The movie does have some problems, but it is easy to overlook it because it is just so gosh darn fun. Honestly I love the ending with the general. It really gets to me. On the other hand I loved both Crosby and Clooney's characters, but I did not buy their relationship and its development. That would be the biggest complaint, but it captures a memory that reminds of me of home more than most other movies. Honestly I really think there is a lot wrong with the movie, but it personally it creates a comfort zone for me that reminds me of what it means to be part of a family. It sounds corny, but I am sounding more corny each day. Good movie and Crosby just shines in a way that men don't shine anymore.",White Christmas
83,movibuf1962,"Christmas in...well, August.",7,24 August 2005,"White Christmas is, simply put, a holiday tradition- but you can certainly enjoy it any time of the year. Others have described the story and script as a straight-forward happy experience, and it is just that. It could've been conceived any time of the year, but as it is, the story bookends two Christmases over the span of ten years. After it settles into the current year of the film, it ends with a luminous Christmas Eve snowfall. Simple, uncluttered magic. The film *is* sentimental and a bit schmaltzy, and that doesn't hurt it one iota. And while Bing Crosby is the star of this one as well as 'Holiday Inn,' I don't entirely buy that this is a remake of that. (No other holidays are mentioned in this film.) But it does have the late Rosemary Clooney (a siren of beauty *and* song) playing nicely off Crosby, especially in the duet ""Count Your Blessings,"" as well as comic genius Danny Kaye- who is especially fine in the satirical ""Choreography"" and his glamorous, Astaire-like dance with Vera-Ellen to ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing."" The film's one sour note is in its leaden third act. It rolls along at a marvelous light-hearted pace for roughly 70 minutes, the principals all approaching their material with an ever-so-sly wink to the audience and each other. (""Snow"" is especially lovely, with the group's 4-part harmony on the train tempered by their deadpan comedy at the less-than-climactic revelation of the 68-degree 'winter playground.') Then a sickeningly small misunderstanding- which could've been resolved in 5 minutes instead of the final third of the movie- slows everything down. But that's nitpicking. Few things on earth can match the joy of a tapping Vera-Ellen or the pair of Crosby and Kaye on the brink of giggles as they lip-sync ""Sisters"" in their rhinestones and feather boas. Would've liked more singing by the gorgeous Clooney, and more than one dance with Kaye and Ellen (but I understand that to be a compromise from the producers, who originally planned for Fred Astaire- and then Donald O'Connor- to be in Kaye's role). The other numbers- ""The Army,"" ""Mandy,"" and the title number- are all winning.",White Christmas

Crosby, Clooney and Kaye are in top form and Dean Jagger and Mary Wickes support beautifully. Extra credit to choreographer Loyal Griggs.",White Christmas
85,magellan333,The title should not be White Christmas.,5,24 December 2004,"Based on the title, I anticipated this movie would be about Christmas. I was very disappointed. The film seems to be a collection of various non-Christmas night club performances set around helping an old army comrade stricken with financial woes. Most of the songs are ones I had never heard before watching this movie. I only recall the title track relating to Christmas. Given the films popularity, I was surprised this film was not any better than it was. I found it to be average with few memorable moments, memorable music or memorable characters. If you are looking for a great old Christmas movie, I recommend It's A Wonderful Life.

I thought the cast were great, especially for Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye. The songs in the movie are a lot of fun as well as some of the dance choreography. The cinematography and the settings are fantastic, and it really not only it gives you the 40s look but more of that Christmas look. The movie is also well written; well edited; and well directed. Again, the movie really does have that Christmas charm and I really had a lot of fun watching this movie. This movie really deserves a lot of the attention as it is still getting today.

It lasted for 2hrs and 45mins with commercials but I didn't mind because I was having so much fun enjoying the characters and musical numbers. So this is Bing Crosby huh? I couldn't take my eyes off him every time he performed. His electric blue eyes drew me in like a moth to a light bulb. Danny Kaye was so charming and witty; a perfect balance to Crosby's serene personality.Rosemary Clooney was the picture of Class and grace. So beautiful and poised, and that voice! Even her hair had class! The only disturbing person to me was Vera-Ellen. She looked like an emaciated stray cat. She was talented no doubt but her 10 inch diameter waist looked a little freakish and they insisted on celebrating it by dressing her in costumes that cinched her waist even more! Honestly it was hard to look at her perform and not cringe.I still give this movie a 10. It was well rounded feel good movie that the entire family could enjoy. Too bad they don't make movies like that anymore.",White Christmas
89,daviddaphneredding,zany comedy and the true spirit of Christmas,10,13 December 2012,"This movie is a ""Christmas tradition"" for me, and has been for many years. The four main cast members form a drawing card-Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, and Vera-Ellen; the latter two are very pretty ladies. Dean Jagger comes across as the stereotype army general, though he is a caring man too. Mary Wickes does her part so well, as the New England busybody, that it was easy to hate her. Both the Florida setting and the New England setting are beautiful. some of the songs are classic, such as ""Snow"", ""Count Your Blessings"", and the biggie ""White Christmas"". The comedy comes about primarily because of miscommunication, mainly between the easy-going Bob Wallace (Crosby) and the hot-headed Betty Haynes (Clooney), started mainly by Emma the housekeeper (Wickes). The movie does have a good resolution and a wonderful ending. What stands out to me is the attitude that there should be concerning Christmas. While the movie is not religious, the ""What's-in-it-for-me?"" attitude is, in one sensed, denounced, while the attitude about giving to someone is strongly emphasized. A great movie. A wonderful story.",White Christmas
90,joncheskin,Tribute to Vets,8,2 January 2015,"This movie seems like a sort of excuse to give lots of singing and dancing opportunities to its various superstars, but underlying the merriment is a bit of pathos. It starts on a battlefield in Europe in the winter of 1944, and a soldier with a beautiful singing voice gently voices a prayer for a white Christmas that perhaps says more about the state of mind of the troops than any terrifyingly violent action film could say. The movie ends up being about finding love, self and some measure of contentment in the period after the war, and for that it packs more feeling than it first appears. For all of its clunky moments, it helps us find a meaningful Christmas.",White Christmas
91,iranu-74195,So strange to see it in 2020 - but now its emptiness is more apparent,4,28 November 2020,"To put the film in context -Elvis was releaseing Heartbreak Hotel just a couple of years later and the Beatles breaking in 5 years. Both those acts had nothing to do with spats, tap, hollywood ""numbers"" and idiotic set ups for ""crooning"" and smart chat. In that regard White Christmas is actually the beginning of the end of Crosby's singing career. which would eventually flounder in the following decade. Crosby 51 and Kaye 43 when they made it - and the sensational dancer Vera-Ellen was not.Possibly the film's 1954 release was to, yes, pay homage to the WW2 military sacrifice (9 years LATE !!) but reality suggests it was put together to further monetise (again) the massive WW2 success of the White Christmas record that broke hearts 13 years earlier in 1941.
The film reaches back to honor. But, even at this stage it didn't want to discuss post War mental illness, physical damage/trauma .. and maybe the concept of doing it all over again in Korea (which had just split in 1953) Maybe the Korean War brought out the WW2 flags again... who knows? But if one is being cynical- White Christmas is opportunistic nostalgia - to get money, not artistic excellence.White Christmas has the gloss of 50s USA, but it is totally reminiscent of ghosts of a young Astair and Gene Kelly - all the stuff that will be swept away by the new youth that was just around the corner. For C's sake, 1954 was also the release of On the Watefront, depicting: thin employment, corruption, desperation and the lies of ""opportunity for all"".
White Chistmas signals the beginning of the end of sound-set, false movies, all made at the the Studio Lot. It is kindly, but fake and empty at the end of the day. In 1946 it might have been hopeful but in 1954. with most of the World still on rationing, bomb sight clearance, and in stagnent poverty, the film is a celebration of American advantage, comfort (for some) and high lifestyle that was not available in the rest of the World.""We can do the show right here!"" they said - and didn't they just.",White Christmas

It makes you miss the times when these sorts of movies would attract a lot of public. To those criticising the movie: it's a Christmas flick. It's supposed to be fluffy, corny, and kitsch. Just like Christmas itself, but that's a part of the magic which attracts a population much larger than the target (Christian) audience. Irving Berlin once more makes a point about being irreplaceable in the traditional Christmas songbook, his tunes are so famous that even those who never heard of the movie know the tracks like ""White Christmas"".",White Christmas
94,mpofarrell,"""Just Like The Ones I Used To Know...""",7,2 December 2002,"One of the most beloved of all holiday movies , WHITE Christmas earns its staying power not because it is great film-making or possesses a timeless story for the ages. Compared with Frank Capra's 1946 masterpiece IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE , the 1954 Paramount musical is a negligible trifle. I suspect what compels people to watch it year after year has more to do with nostalgia than anything else. WHITE Christmas is ultimately an enjoyable , even moving experience because it evokes a simpler , more innocent time. Produced less than a decade after World War 2 , the picture's screenwriters use the memory of the war to give the story some dramatic weight but most of the movie is a succession of musical dance numbers , some better than others. With song contributions from Irving Berlin , most written expressly for the movie ( the exception being the title song , which originally debuted in 1942's HOLIDAY INN ) and with great vocals by stars Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney , WHITE Christmas is really a must -see. Its hackneyed plot about two war buddies who form a song and dance act , meet a sister act , fall in love and then help save their old Army general's failing Vermont Inn is pure cornball. Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye play the song and dance team of Wallace and Davis with great verve , with the same kind of chemistry that distinguished the Crosby and Hope ""Road"" movies Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen compliment the two men beautifully , Clooney with her rich , expressive singing voice and Ellen with her considerable dancing pyrotechnics. These powerhouse talents can't supplant a woefully weak script but they do manage to take your mind off it often enough to enjoy all the professionalism involved. WHITE Christmas is the work of many seasoned professionals , starting with prolific director Michael Curtiz , a veteran of the silent days who went on to helm the Academy Award winning CASABLANCA among other notable entertainments ; the venerable Irving Berlin , whose songs , even the lesser ones that fill this movie , are never less than enjoyable ; the wonderful supporting performances of Dean Jagger , the epitome of the ""grand old"" army man , and Mary Wickes , the nosy but lovable Innkeeper. The movie became the biggest box-office hit of 1954 , opening in October and playing to full houses right through the New Year. It garnered only one Oscar nomination , not surprisingly for Mr. Berlin , who penned the lovely lullaby ""Count Your Blessings Instead Of Sheep"". Rosemary Clooney was showcased not only as a splendid singer but a first rate actress as well. And of course Berlin's masterwork , the movie's title song , was given two terrific renditions , one sung by Crosby near the battlefield accompanied by a plaintive music box , the other a rousing Technicolor finale joined by the entire cast and chorus. WHITE Christmas is overly -sentimental , often silly and sometimes even preposterous. But it's a hard movie to fight. If you are feeling the least bit sentimental and start to watch this holiday staple , for better or worse you'll most likely succumb to its ragged charms.",White Christmas

It's mainly about the singing and dancing, which is all top-notch. The plot is kind of thin, but it is sweet and sentimental. This movie was a product of America's ""greatest generation"", and it is a testament to the fact that that generation truly was better, in every sense, than the generations that followed. It sad that the stars of this movie are all gone, and this probably is true of most everyone who had anything to do with it. Every aspect of the production quality is first-rate. The film quality is superb and has not deteriorated, as evidenced by the superb picture quality on a modern HDTV. Sound recording has improved since then, but the sound quality is as good as it needs to be. Just a thoroughly movie, that allows you to relax for a couple of hours and forget about whatever it is that you worry about. There are no shoot-outs, robberies, rapes, ax murders, or autopsies. It is a sad commentary on where we have come in the sixty years since this movie was made, that Hollywood movies and television shows need to have those elements in order to be financially successful. Well, not always, but more often than not. Call it ""fluff"" if you want, but in spite of being fluff, and partly because of it, ""White Christmas"" is a unique, special movie, pretty much in a category of its own, and without question one of the better movies that was ever made.

97,joseph952001,Count Your Blessings That You've Seen This Film,10,26 October 2006,"I remember when this movie first came out, and a clip was played from the movie to promote it on television. It was the scene where Rosemary Clooney has been misinformed about what Bing is going to do to promote the show and she slams a chair on the stage and walks off. This was at a time when new Wide-Screen Movies were going a-muck and this was the first movie presented in Vista-Vision one of the many to come our way such as Cinamascope, Super-Scope, Cinerama, and Todd-A-O just to mention a few. So, we know the movie and how entertaining it is, but there is a little history behind it and one of it's stars.Rosemary Cloony, born and raised in Maysville, Kentucky, started singing here in Cincinnati, Ohio with her sister Betty on W.L.W. Radio, and then eventually Rosemary went to New York City and then eventually to Hollywood where she made a few films, but White Christmas was to be her most well known and successful film of her career. I remember when Rosemary made her debut in the movies in ""The Stars Are Singing"" and we were having exams in High School, so after the exams a friend of mine and I went to the Albee Theater and saw her walk in through the Vine Street Stage Door to the theater. Then between showings she got on the stage, sang some songs and talked about how it was so amazing to see herself on that big movie screen. So, years later, Rosemary's brother Nick would be our news anchor at W.K.R.C. television and then his son George Clooney, Rosemarys nephew, would make his mark in Hollywood as an excellent actor. Wonder where he got the talent from? So, Rosemary was on Tom Snyders Show on T.V. and he said, ""I guess you're very proud of George, aren't you?"" And she answered, ""Oh, yes! But when he first came to Hollywood, all he wanted to do was sit on my couch, watch T.V., and drink beer. So, I had to kick his ass out of the house tell him to get a job!"" So, back to White Christmas: One thing that people don't know is that Donald O'Connor was originally scheduled to play the Danny Kaye part but couldn't so he eventually played with Bing Crosby in the remake of ""Anything Goes"", and since Vera Ellen never really had a good singing voice, her voice double was usually Anita Ellis and for Call Me Madam, Carole Richards, who dubbed mostly for Cyd Charisse, but for White Christmas, when Vera Ellen is singing, that's really Rosemary's sister Betty Clooney dubbing for Vera Ellen's singing voice. By the way, Vera Ellen was born and raised in a section of Cincinnati, Ohio called Norwood! We can count our blessings that we have such wonderful entertainers from this city, including Doris Day, George Chakiris, Tyrone Power, and there's a rumor that Roy Rogers was born on the waterfront, and of course, the Looney Clooney's including George!",White Christmas

I happen to like the film, ""Holiday Inn"", very much, and I like this film as well. But,the characters are different, the plot is different, and so are most of the songs.Both films are holiday classics. Each film can be judged on its own merits.There is one additional comment I'd like to make. Irving Berlin was a shrewd businessman as well as a great composer. For various movie studios, he'd pitch ideas for films (using his music of course and getting film credit above the title), and then not only write new material but revive some of his old songs. This was a very smart way of making money by re-popularizing mostly forgotten songs. By the way, the composer makes money every time his song is played on radio or TV.Not only is ""White Christmas"" an example, but also ""Alexander's Ragtime Band"", ""Blue Skies"", ""Easter Parade"", and ""There's No Business Like Show Business"".",White Christmas

Happily, when I saw ""White Christmas"" yesterday at my local theater, it proved to be far superior to what I had recalled.Capt. Bob Wallace (Bing Crosby) and Private First Class Phil Davis (Danny Kaye), both serving in the U.S. Army in World War II, starring in a musical comedy show for the troops in their outfit, lead a big good-bye show for Gen. Waverly (Dean Jagger), their commander, who is returning to the states. After the war is over, Wallace and Davis form their own singing-dancing duo and begin scoring well in live theater in the New York City area.They meet two other musical and dance performers, Betty (Rosemary Clooney) and Judy (Vera-Ellen) Haynes, who are sisters, and, naturally, a double romance begins to brew. The four wind up at a ""holiday inn,"" so to speak, in Vermont, and discover that the owner is none other than (retired) Gen. Waverly, whose bankroll is rapidly ""getting small"" because of no snow (in Vermont?!) and few customers.After several songs, both on stage and well-placed within scenes, Wallace gets in touch with a TV producer back in New York City, who agrees to set up a live TV show from the inn, which will be designed as a big tribute to Waverly (who must be kept ""in the dark"" until the trap is sprung).After some additional plot twists in which Betty gets mad at Bob because she thinks (incorrectly) that the show is going to be designed to poke fun at Waverly; and Judy tries to lure Phil into announcing a phony engagement between the two to try to get Betty and Bob back together; the movie finally climaxes with a giant Christmas show in the big dining hall at the inn, with many, many of Waverly's former subordinates from his Army career there with their wives; and the two show business couples finally falling into each other's arms. Good flick; good characterizations, although not terribly deep.Now: A few minor quibbles that kept me from giving it 10 votes:The opening scenes near the ""battlefield"" in France wouldn't have fooled a 5-year-old; the sets were very obviously in a Hollywood studio.Crosby's and Kaye's characters' names -- Bob Wallace and Phil Davis -- come on, guys! How Whitebread can you get? They needed a little more pizazz than that.Clooney's ""lady in a snit, if you don't know why, I'm not gonna tell you"" attitude when she thinks she has uncovered an unpleasant angle to the show being planned by Crosby. Why didn't she just tell him? Oh, I know why: It would have untangled the plot twists too soon.All in all, though, an excellent classic movie.",White Christmas
106,Sweet Charity,I'm dreaming of... WHITE CHRISTMAS!,10,19 November 2000,"I absolutely ADORE this movie!  Have since the first time I saw it! Sure... some may classify it as simply a ""feel-good"" movie, but what's wrong with that?  Some may also classify it as pure schmaltz, but the movie truly does have it's sad points... like the priceless look on General Waverly's face whenever he enters the room where everyone who had been under his division is awaiting his arrival!The movie has a truly wonderful musical score, not to mention some VERY kick butt dancing!Bing Crosby is charming as Bob Wallace, a calm and reserved, yet witty and delightful and wise-cracking, and somewhat cynical kind of guy. Bing truly performed to his greatest.  And his vocal talent is enormous, not to mention evident throughout the entire movie!  It's a real treat to see him crack up when he and Danny Kaye are performing their rendition of ""Sisters""!Danny Kaye is hilarious as Phil Davis, the foil to calm and cool Bob. Phil, too, is full of wise-cracks, and very intent on getting Bob to settle down. Danny gave such a life to his character, portraying him like no other! His best one liner was when a young blonde with voice like nails on a chalk board says to him (after his phoney engagment to Judy) ""I sure wish it would happen to me!"") to which he replies ""So do I!""Rosemary Clooney is absolutely riveting as Betty Haynes, the older of the two Haynes sisters.  She is the most calm and most subdued.  She is looking for her ""knight on the white horse"" in life.  Rosemary played Betty to the fullest, making her every bit as believable as you could imagine!  And that voice... GOLDEN!  A gift from God!  It's a true treasure to see her in her solo ""Love (You Didn't Do Right By Me)"".  She's absolutely marvelous and extremely talented.Vera-Ellen is refreshingly delightful as Judy Haynes, the younger and more naive Haynes sister.  Judy is also the dreamer of the two.  Vera-Ellen does a wonderfully through job of portraying Judy!  She is a perfect foil to her older sister.  And those dancing stems... to see her dance in numbers like ""Mandy"" and ""Choreography"" is a real treat!  How ANYONE could ever dance as well as she is beyond me!  She really did a great job in this movie, even better than her performance in ""On The Town"" with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Betty Garrett.A GREAT MOVIE!!!!  GREAT CAST CHEMISTRY!!!!

107,bcrd500,Your Age Will Reflect Whether You Like This Movie,5,25 December 2020,"I recently watched this movie beginning to end and came away with two conclusions: The closer your birth-age is to the year it was made will influence how much you like the movie and if more than $5.00 was paid for continuity, it was too much. This movie has so many errors, it is impossible to count and considering the talent in the movie one would think the producers of the film would have hired people to ensure it did not look so sloppy.The 1950s and early 1960s saw musical's like this fade into the sunset. I can now watch Elvis movies and wonder where the idea that bursting into song while backed by music played on the car radio came from and how stupid it looked. This movie would have been much better if presented as a straight drama with songs played over the credits and I forced myself to watch it just to get a real feeling for how badly it was made.Another problem with the movie is Bing Crosby, at 51, playing the part of a 35-year old character. He is much too old for the part and I realize he sings the title song and he was probably one of the driving forces behind getting it made but he does not work for me. Neither does Danny Kaye simply because I have never liked anything he did. That is the age problem for me, once I was old enough to watch it that type of movie held no appeal since the 1970s had dawned and even the Elivs' movies had died a peaceful death. I am 70 and another twenty years and this thing will be looked at the way the silent movie has been viewed for over fifty years.",White Christmas

Its seemed very personal. Did he insult someone ? "" I'm not a dancer I'm a CHOREOGRAPHER ! ""

114,GordJackson,Not The Sum Of It's Too Many Parts!,4,7 December 2013,"Like a few posters before me, I truly wanted to like ""White Christmas."" Sadly, I cannot, at least not very much. Set mostly post WWII, this one has Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye as discharged army buddies who make it big in show business, eventually winding up in a far-too-balmy Vermont (for December) trying their best to help their retired general (Dean Jagger) to make a go of his debt-ridden inn. Bing is the driven one, Kaye more the playboy, with Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen falling into line as the sister act/plot device that ushers in the cliché-ridden romantic complications. A noble effort to be sure, the film struggles mightily to overcome its paint-by-numbers script and leaden direction, but all to no avail. Lacking even a modicum of genuine on-screen chemistry between Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney, this bloated, lugubrious mishmash simply staggers from one over-produced dance routine to the next, literally at times 'stopping the show.' Yes, there are a few shiny bobbles to be found thanks to Bing's excellent vocalizing, the multi-talented Danny Kaye's sharp comedy timing (and hoofing), Vera-Ellen's superb dancing, and costumes icon Edith Head's wardrobe expertise. But that is it! All too often Bing Crosby looks decidedly uncomfortable and out of place, Rosemary Clooney appears to be auditioning to be the next Hitchcock 'ice-blond' and Michael Curtiz seems to have been bizarrely seized of the notion that 'sledgehammer directing' was the only way to ensure musical comedy success. Oh where was Stanely Donen when we needed him. Being a lover of musicals, and genuinely respecting the many great talents involved in this enterprise, it makes me very sad to come on as the Grinch with this one. But try as I might, I just can't be very positive about it.",White Christmas

I also found some other goofs in the film; before the 2 guys escape from the theater through the window, they drop the feather fans used by the Haynes Sisters in their act; yet when the sisters later perform, the fans re-appear. Also, a taxi miraculously appears alongside the side of the theater to take the guys to the train station just as they exit through the window and they catch the train to Vermont.

For example, some of the male dancers that are on staff with the Wallace and Davis show, are the same guys who dance in the night club act with Rosemary Clooney's character.

I've never seen it, and with it being a ""classic"" and all, I thought I'd give it a try. It is unwatchable.Everything, including battlefield scenes, seems to be shot inside with cheap sets. And the plot is horribly boring. It's just an excuse for Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye to sing and dance together. And two guys up on stage singing and dancing together like they do in this movie looks really strange to the modern eye.Everything about the movie is dated. From the unrealistic dialogue to the horrible acting, nothing about this movie holds up. And it doesn't have to be that way. There are movies from over 50 years ago that still hold up pretty well, like Gone With The Wind and some old comedies. But so much of what was made back then consists of horrible movies with bad plots in which stereotypical women end up with the male lead.Sometime in the 1960s things started to get better. Realistic movies shot on location and truly funny comedies like the Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies started to emerge. But White Christmas falls into the category of dated movies that nobody today would pay to see. These movies look like someone filmed a bad play.",White Christmas

And he put all his skills to use in this film along side Bing Crosby and Co. Never the less, it was still tough to get through. The neat thing is, is that I got to see it in an actual movie theater, as meant to be, I suppose. It's really a campy story - and if I'd been a studio Exec in 1953, and heard the Pitch, Synopsis and Scenario, I would not have green-lighted it at all! ha.Basically, a song-n-dance duo (Kaye/Crosby) meet two lovely sister who kinda do the same. Said sisters travel to VT for a gig, and the boys follow them all the way. Olny to get there and find out, that an old commanding general of theirs from WWII own the lodge where gig was at, and learn that the old man is in debt and about to lose everything. The two song-n-dance duos (with lots of lovin' and flirting in between) orchestrate a way to save the old fellow, and have a Merry Christmas together.

Plus Michael Curtiz is the director. So I thought it should be pretty good since I have seen many of his films and enjoyed them Watching the movie, I realized that it was actually a pretty good feel good movie. Not my favorite, but not bad nonetheless. It was cute and humorous (probably the only reason I enjoyed the film). The stars of the film had wonderful voices and there seemed to be an equal balance between the comedy and music. I have seen old/the first musicals that are really bizarre and strange with the sets. They always seemed to have that one man singing with beautiful women around him with detailed and ostentatious sets, even ""Singin' in the Rain"" had evidence of this. But ""White Christmas"" even though it was a fluff piece was nice and really served the purpose of making the audience feel good. Truthfully, even though it was Curtiz directing, nothing really stood out in the film for me. But that could have easily been caused by my aversion of Christmas.The director Michael Curtiz did a good job directing this film but this film doesn't even come close to ""Mildred Pierce""(1945), ""Casablanca""(1942), or ""The Jazz Singer""(1952). But for a Christmas and musical film it wasn't that bad. Probably won't watch it again but I do like Michael Curtiz so I thought I'd give it a try.

White Christmas is over the worst of the three.The plot is simple (so simple you can predict the ending and the plot twists before the film starts) two men get out of the army and decided to star a two man show. They receive lots of success and then they meet to young ladies and decide to go on vacation during the holidays with them. It would be a lie to say the acting was bad, Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney were fabulous and everyone else was also good.Perhaps the best part of 'White Christmas' is the costumes and musical numbers. Edith Head designed some of the most stunning costumes I've ever seen in a 50s movies.

It has great performances by the 4 leads (Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera Ellen) who act, sing and dance with effortless aplomb. Crosby and Kaye have some amazing comic set pieces. It also has Mary Wickes in one of her signature comic supporting roles. Criticism of the acting in this film is really off base--the movie requires a certain style and the performances reflect it perfectly. This is the kind of film that could never be made now and it contains all the genuine pleasures of the movie musical as developed by Hollywood. There are several wonderful scenes set in ""supper clubs"" which evoke a bygone era.

If you haven't seen it--I guarantee you will want to watch it every holiday season after you do.",White Christmas
127,warrenk-2,Powerful Rosemary Clooney,6,10 June 2007,"White Christmas is based on or influenced by at least two Paramount films from the 1940s. Holiday Inn (1942) introduced Irving Berlin's ""White Christmas"", which won the Oscar for Best Song. It also plotted the story of a country inn only open on holidays, and, of course, starred Bing Crosby with his pipe and Fred Astaire as his dancing co-star. The non-singing though not bad dancing Marjorie Reynolds was cast as the female lead in what seemed to be Paramount's attempt to make a star of her in the same style that had recently failed with Mary Martin, who returned to Broadway to made show biz history.Another film, Here Come the Waves (1944), had twin sisters (played by Betty Hutton) who were a singing act and who each got respectively paired with the film's male stars Crosby, as a successful crooner, and Sonny Tufts, as, well, Sonny Tufts, as all of them go off to win World War II. The twin sisters element gave Betty Hutton the opportunity to play one sister as serious and the other in Hutton's popular bombastic style.These elements more or less combine in White Christmas, a typical movie musical enhanced by Technicolor and the new widescreen process VistaVision, which I believe Paramount initiated with this film. White Christmas never really interested me much, but I always liked the number, ""The Best Things Happen When You're Dancing,"" danced by Vera-Ellen and Danny Kaye.Rosemary Clooney's performance, however, grew more and more interesting with each viewing. This woman was not only strong but angry. About what is not so clear, but can be read as pre-women's movement discontent that somehow had seeped into a mainstream Hollywood musical, and may have been one of the reasons Clooney's film career lasted only several years. (Audiences' growing dissatisfaction with traditional movie musicals was also a factor.) Clooney and Crosby perfectly balance each other and I find it interesting to imagine them in a more serious film attempt at mid-1950s male/female relationships, although sometimes these unexpected subtexts play more successfully than a feature film which is often cursed by having to be serious drama. Still, I liked Crosby in the lesser known drama Little Boy Lost from this period while I've never been able to sit through The Country Girl, even with William Holden.",White Christmas
128,spankymac,It touches.,9,6 December 2005,"Plenty has been written about this movie. For the record, I disagree with those who say that Danny Kaye's performance was a disappointment. It's a little understated, for him, but it's the right foil for Bing. Rosemary's a knockout. Vera's amazing. And Bing was at his Basset Hound best. When Vera and Danny dance, you can tell they were having fun with it. Sure, it's a corny flick, but it works because it touches people at an emotional level; it's easy to overlook the few noticeable gaffes. As cheesy as it is, it's perfectly easy to suspend disbelief and go with it; we get caught up in the story, and we like the people in the film.

If you saw it and liked it then go for it, my wife loves this movie and that is fine but it feels to old fashioned and out dated for my taste and I love older films. It was made in the 50's but feels like the 40's, so it was out dated then, in just one year after this rock n roll would come into light and bring music and culture into the next century.

133,The_Dman313,An Encompassed Feeling Nearly Lost in Time,8,25 December 2018,"Watching White Christmas is like a remembrance of past nostalgias. It all brings me back to a time when I was young, where Christmas was the single most magical event there ever was. It was a time of endless and unbreakable euphoria, a feeling nearly unattainable with my age. And yet, this film managed to incite even more from me. Through its difference it comes to represent not only the past, but also the present. To show how these past nostalgia have shaped us into a hopeful and wiser version of ourselves, making me all the more grateful for today. Hidden beneath this glamorous portrayal of Christmas and performance, is something of true human sincerity and the ever present love for the moment, propelling the film into something extraordinary.First off, one aspect that sticks out about this film is it's dialogue. Upon hearing the back and forths it is all purely fun! The dialogue is witty and always feels as if it's consequential, as it's constantly building up to the next event. However, the main staple is how revealed these characters become through communication. Every piece of banter between each character gradually leads up to one being sincere. Slowly but surely the essence of each character begins to break through. We can't help but feel that they actually pondered the situation with the intelligence of a real person and simply stated what they felt deep down. It's a testament to this film on how much it respects and communicates the true human essence of each character. In a way, and like all great films, the dialogue felt like a reflection of real life. How so many of our conversations feel light hearted, with an emphasis on humor, and yet it's through these discussions that staples of who we truly are end up seeping through.It's because of how well defined each character is that the humor with it worked all the better. It's like a sitcom cast that you're well acquainted with. It's not the specific joke written, but the character actually saying it. The feeling that these real people, with all their complexities known to us, are actually saying these lines as if it was thought up in the moment. This can't help but propel life into it, containing the human aspects lacking on paper.Another notable aspect is its cinematography. In this case the camera felt like a character. It always seems to be reacting with the most insightful responses. It pans from thing to thing, highlighting the individual in the room and detailing them through their telling movements. It also embodies the mood of the room. This is ever present when the said mood is romance. The camera always seems to start with a subjective wide shot, encompassing the characters within a large room, as it seems to get seductively closer and closer. Pretty soon it's all built up to the max of anticipation. And then they kiss, making us feel as if it was truly worked for. But it's not all personal. There's glamour to the musical numbers, as these fantasy like moments are perfectly communicated through the camera that seems to soar as it takes up each bit of beautiful scenery. It all then becomes fulfilled with the beautiful and seamlessly intricate dances.And of course, the dancing and music is perfect. This is all obvious when including such professionals. Of course it will be perfect! But what about the ""why"" of it? How does it communicate the present emotions of the story? Well, pretty amazingly and it's the reason why it holds up so much as a musical. The dancers themselves felt suave, respectable, and yet harnessed this child like fun to it all. They use this to perfectly communicate the almost funny feelings of love, the unrelenting and yet seamless energy towards passion, and (most beautifully) the true joyful feeling of the present moment, where everything right seems to hit you all at once. Music all adds to this, through its communication of the joyfulness, the melodrama, the energy, and the liveliness of Christmas! It's all very glorious, as both communicated these feelings far greater than it could have been done any other way.As I write this now it is Christmas Eve. Having seen this movie I feel as if part of my past spirit of childhood has been restored to me. I'm bewildered on how much a film like this could instill into a person, and I'm so grateful to have seen it. As I go to bed tonight, restless and anticipating Christmas Day, I have no doubt that I'll be counting my blessings instead of sheep.And on a final note: Happy Holidays to whoever is reading! Whether you be young or old, or have the holiday spirit or not, I wish you the best!",White Christmas
134,yayagirl14,This is the classic Christmas movie of all time,10,20 December 2006,"This is one of the most underrated Christmas movies i think. It has classic songs, actors, and plot (though some things don't really fit, but that is in most movies in the 40s and 50s) I think this movie should be religiously watched every Christmas. The acting is wonderful, Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney are amazing. The comedy is great with Danny Kaye, and Vera Ellen brings great dancing to the picture. All the music is amazing, my favorite song is the Mandy, with its great dancing and funny jokes. The costumes are fabulous, with vibrant colors. Overall this movie is pretty much amazing, everything is just perfect when your in the Christmas mood.",White Christmas
135,tejonm,The movie seems to capitalize on the title song,4,25 November 2006,"Somehow I missed this when it was showing in the theaters---I was home with a new baby. So this afternoon many, many years later I saw it on TV for the first time. A lot of people love it and while I have always loved both ""der Bingle"" and Danny Kaye--I didn't feel they worked too well together. To me, the movie seemed an attempt to capitalize on the success of the song, ""White Christmas"", written for ""Holiday Inn"" { I'd like to see that again} I felt that Irving Berlin was rather ""off his game""------the only really big song is White Christmas and it wasn't written for this movie. Of all the songs in the movie, only 2 of them ""Count your Blessings"" and ""Sisters"" I could even dimly recall! I guess you can't please everyone. Perhaps my problem is that I don't have any happy memories connected with it.",White Christmas
136,tms1983,The BEST Christmas movie EVER,10,11 November 2001,"I had seen White Christmas several times on TV and later on VHS.  This movie is at THE TOP of my list of ""Must Watch"" Christmas movies/specials. Having never seen Holiday Inn, so I cannot make any comparisons and do not wish to. The four leads in the movie are acted beautifully and the music is wonderful.10/10",White Christmas
137,larry-labati,"Pleasant as a musical, but not very ""Christmas-sy""",7,6 March 2009,"I will have to say that I do agree with many of the more negative comments posted here about this movie, however, there is something about the film over-all that still seems to be entertaining, to a point.Perhaps because I am a big musical film fan, this movie still appeals to me , despite its flaws.I do have to say that seeing that Michael Curtiz directed this still seems to be a bit of a surprise, given all the other (more dramatic and even early horror films that he was responsible for).The film itself has a very ""feel good"" air about it, and the many numbers by Irving Berlin just goes to show what a very prolific and talented songwriter he was, even this late in his career.The number ""Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" with Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen is probably the high point for me in the movie, it truly is a wonderful and entertaining duet, with the two of them hopping over the walkway and over the water, and around the poles.By contrast , the 'Mandy"" number is a bit too overblown of a production for my taste, although, again, Vera-Ellen is a joy to watch, even though she is a bit dwarfed by all the chorus boys and girls surrounding her.I do like this film to a degree, but I feel that Holiday Inn(1942) is a bit better, and lastly, I do not quite see how this later film is considered a re-make of the first. They do not have the same story line at all.",White Christmas
138,bd18packer,My favorite Christmas movie,10,15 November 2006,"I cannot remember a Christmas season when I did not watch ""White Christmas"" on broadcast television, cable and satellite, at least once. I purchased a VHS copy some years ago, when my job did not permit me to watch it during Christmas Eve with my family. The performances by Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney, Vera Ellen and Dean Jagger are excellent. The Irving Berlin Music, Choreography, Cinematography, and Direction by Michael Curtiz are outstanding. The rich Technicolor on the film, in wide screen Vistavision format no less, the dancing, singing, the indoor and outdoor scenes(even those on a sound stage), the supporting characters and the staging are wonderful. Rosemary Clooney never looked so beautiful or Bing Crosby more handsome. Danny Kaye is marvelous, dancing and singing, and acting too. This film brings a tear to my eye at the end of the film every time I watch it. I love this film, and never tire of seeing it, year after year. I watch other Christmas movies during the holiday season, but this is my hands down favorite. I would love to find a DVD copy of this movie in a widescreen format similar to Vistavision, to enjoy this classic all over again.",White Christmas
139,amunastra,Vera Ellen steals the show with her dancing,10,13 October 2006,"I have watched White Christmas about 100 times, the reason is Vera Ellen .I have never in the thousands of movies i have seen,witnessed a dancer of Vera Ellens ability. Vera mesmerises me every time i see the movie.Don't just take my word for it,watch White Christmas a few times and watch Vera Dance i guarantee you will never witness a dancer male or female that comes close to Veras excellence.Danny Kaye is superb Bing sings with so much ease ,with that fabulous voice.Rosemary Clooney looks gorgeous and her voice is a thrill to listen too.I shall watch White Christmas many times in the future and Vera Ellen will continue to be the star as far as i am concerned.",White Christmas
140,Hmaziba,"""White Christmas"" musical movie that capture my entirely memory every year during Christmas.",8,6 May 2017,"White Christmas directed by Michael Curtiz, Unforgettable Hollywood director, the moments you watch the movie, it will bring attention to keep watching an amazing colorful picture and miser en scene. For the first time White Christmas had a challenged contiguous technicolor that made Gene Kelly's to dance in a very good style. Like wise other Curtiz work, White Christmas has a very good ending though the beginning was difficult to understanding. However, it's in studio movie recording but the connection from one scene to another is little bit difficult to understand. In the meantime, White Christmas is probably the greatest example of the classic Hollywood film. Shot entirely on Hollywood sets, using studio actors, directors, and writers. Finally, as Christmas remain to be celebrated every year, same as ""White Christmas"" have been watching every year to accomplish my seasons Christmas flavor.",White Christmas
141,bturtle_17,Brief Comments,5,5 December 2000,"I thought that I would like this movie, as a fan of 1940s and 50s musicals, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  In comparison to the 1942 ""Holiday Inn"", ""White Christmas"" is flimsy, artificial, and boring. In comparison to more recent holiday fare, however, ""White Christmas"" is a harmless dose of sentimental, post-WWII sugar.",White Christmas
142,kenztay,Danny Kaye steals every scene he is in,8,15 January 2021,A magical and beloved film that I've loved since my childhood. It is a testament to Danny Kaye's talent as both an actor and an entertainer that he can perform and act alongside Bing Crosby yet manage to steal every scene. His character's optimism and excitement are infectious. Clooney is also an absolute gem in this film. I watch it every year.,White Christmas
143,I_have_an_Afro_deziac,beautiful movie......legend,10,21 November 2007,"This movie will live on as a ten out of ten, its a masterpiece and a small treasure, and every year millions of family look back on it during the holidays. I love watching it during the holidays because it gives me that cozy feeling, with my small cup of hot chocolate and the dresses up Christmas tree....what is Christmas without it? Anyone who dispises this movie, do you have Christmas spirit? It makes you feel warm, no matter what age, what year, what time it is, it always makes you feel at home and I don't understand how people can be disliking such a beautiful uprising movie. It's so indescribable, in a good way, I'm always going to love this movie.",White Christmas
144,steelerstwin,Just not very good,3,11 December 2010,"Michael Curtiz does a good job directing this picture, but the script, music and performances just don't add up to much.First off, this isn't a holiday movie at all. Other than the ending, there just isn't much holiday atmosphere to be found. Secondly, every five minutes another song or dance routine is thrown into the mix. With SO much music, it's only logical that there's gonna be some ""padding"" and this flick is loaded with lousy songs... ""What Do You Do With A General"", ""Sisters"", ""Gee I Wish I Was Back in the Army"". Ugh. The only worse piece of work by Irving Berlin was ""Mr. President"" in 1962 and that was truly horrid.Then there is the right-wing, militaristic theme we see everywhere in this picture. Sure, you can't avoid it with a plot device like a retired general, but the flag waving would make even Fox News fans want to hurl red, white and blue.Other things about this picture are disturbing... Vera Ellen's high neck-wear (to hide tell-tale signs of her bulimia) and her emaciated waist and legs, the ridiculous romance between a young and pretty Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby who was well into his 50's by this point. Bing's absurd hep-cat language. It's as if we're just supposed to ignore all this stuff because it's a big budget, technicolor songfest by happy, shiny people. Look at Bing's reaction shots and he looks like he's about to fall asleep. And watch him at the end of the film. He looks like a retired clown in that red outfit.There ARE some bright spots. The title track is one of the best holiday songs ever and Bing acquits himself well. The dance sequence with Danny Kaye and Vera Ellen is done very well and Kaye doesn't get his due in this picture. But these things just can't make up for a movie that wants you to suspend disbelief, but can't pull it off. Once something gets rolling, the next three scenes fall far short. I cringe when I see Bing talking to his old army buddies about how great things were in the war, it's just so fake. No infantry man in the history of the planet ever walked, talked or felt that way about the hell of combat. Then there's Dean Jagger's haggard, old General routine, always falling into military jargon that sounds false and hollow. The way the old troops cozy up to him at the end of the picture is nauseating - not because there's anything wrong with those patriotic feelings, but because the script can't pull it off.This movie just doesn't gel and you're really pulling for it to do so, but it just never comes. Star power alone isn't enough to make it work because this movie believes in its own falsehoods. It really DOES think its a great, classic musical. It really DOES think its funny and it really DOES believe that WE will believe the convoluted plot devices, laughable romantic scenes and terrible ""dance"" routines with Crosby-Kaye. Really? We're supposed to believe that a vaudeville team is the hottest act in show biz in the mid 50's? Elvis, Chuck Berry, Martin and Lewis and Little Richard might beg to differ. Look, really LOOK at how un-entertaining the showbiz schtick really is. Bing and Danny don't really entertain much at all. Why this horrible movie is a classic is beyond me. I guess it's because it's ""supposed to be"". Not enough for me though. See ""Holiday Inn"", ""Christmas In Connecticut"" or the 1951 classic ""Scrooge"" with Alistar Sim in the title role if you want to see a real classic. ""White Christmas"" is crap.",White Christmas
145,stevenbeech,Maybe its because i'm a limey,6,29 October 2011,"I really really tried. I really really wanted to love this film. I'd been wanting to see it for ages. I got myself all cosy and ready and put it on ready to immerse myself in Hollywoods golden age and then...I was subjected to nearly 2 hours of schtick, disjointed ideas and a few set pieces wedged together for some reason. I didn't get it at all. Its not that the films aged particularly badly or anything. It's a product of its time, I understand that and the film does have its charms there's some fizzing dialogue. Bing Crosby is never going to be dreadful and neither is Danny Kaye the set pieces are great its just the way they get to them doesn't really make any sort of sense. It all feels a bit contrived and a bit clunky. I'm happy to admit that its me thats at fault and actually i'm not watching the film correctly. I don't really like Superman because he's just a bit too nice. This film is the same. Its just a bit too nice I know its supposed to be but they do everything but ladle on the schmaltz with shovels and build the stage with candy canes. Its all just a bit too much. There's just too much everything. That said maybe with repeated viewings you build up a tolerance to it and it starts to make sense. I can't give this a 1 because its not an awful film. Its got heart and charm and its hearts in the right place but its by no means the film I hoped it would be and it certainly doesn't flow or make any sort of sense. Sorry. Guess i'll need to force a few more viewings and see if I can make myself love itEdit:- Since I wrote the initial review I rewatched the film and on repeated viewing I liked it much better. It really is a musical in the truest sense of the word, the bits between the songs are there to get you to the songs kind of like the biscuit bits of Oreos are there to get you to the cream. Once I understood that I was a lot more forgiving toward it. Also really its Bing Crosby and Christmas, you can't be criticizing it too hard, you'd be a coal hearted creature if you didn't warm to it at all. It is a feelgood film, it does leave you warm and fuzzy and it is likable, good natured and the sort of film they will never make again purely because there are no actors like these and the sort of schmaltz we have now is just not as sincere as this. I was wrong to give it a 2, i'm sorry IMDb. I change my mind and give it a 6. Its far better than I initially thought but still not what I want it to be or hoped it would be but the fault is entirely mine",White Christmas

Choreography unofficially by Bob Fosse, ""The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"" with Kaye and Ellen is one of the best dance routines on film, period.

149,BadBoy117007,"""I'm (partly) dreaming of a White Christmas...""",6,23 December 2008,"Every year at Christmas time we see that there's always one channel playing Irving Berlin's ""White Christmas."" Bing Crosby's follow-up film to ""Holiday Inn"" is cheesy good fun from near the end of the golden days of Hollywood. The songs are catchy (a little TOO catchy) and the script is memorable (and predictable). But it seemed like the studio was trying very hard to throw a script together after they realized the actual song White Christmas (sung by Crosby in ""Holiday Inn"") was a huge success.The memorable actress in the film shouldn't be Rosemary Clooney, but her 'sister' Vera Ellen. Clooney masks a great performance with awful lip-syncing that's not convincing even for a two year old, as well as a romantic lead role that she doesn't come out with until the very end of the film.Danny Kaye is a joy as usual, as is Bing Crosby with his mediocre acting but very entertaining singing voice. Kaye (in my book) is a greater Hollywood gem than Crosby who should have been the leads in many films, however he seemed to do better as the 'comic relieving sidekick.' ""White Christmas"" is always a holiday delight that's very unbelievable and not a good film. But always good to see just once a year before Christmas just to keep up your Christmas spirits!",White Christmas

Thanks to my music-loving mother, I grew up watching wonderful Hollywood musicals.White Christmas is filled with Irving Berlin songs which are magnificently performed by Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney(Vera Ellen lipsynched).  Perhaps even more wonderful than the songs themselves, is the production numbers.  Vera Ellen and Danny Kaye make a wonderful couple and dance so well together.  Everybody should see the movie simply for ""The Best Things Happen While You'r Dancing"" scene.  This is quite possibly the most beautiful scene ever filmed, in my opinion.  Another thing about the film that I love is the costumes.  They are all beautfully made and worn.

If White Christmas isn't at least number 3 on the must see Christmas movie each year, you are gypping yourself from a true classic.White Chirstmas has classic scenes that the whole family can participate in. It is the Rocky Horror Picture Show of the Christmas movies. The family can sing such classic songs as ""Snow"" and ""Gee, I Wish I Were Back in the Army"" and can act along with the ""Sisters"" act (women first, then the men).
For those in college, this is the perfect movie to play drinking games. Find a line in the movie that is repeated a lot (""It must be beautiful this time in Vermont"") or a repeated gesture and take a shot when it is done. You'll be drunk in no time.Besides the fun that can be had throughout the movie, this movie has all the shumltz that a typical Christmas movie should have. The movie is cheesy and wonderful.

I don't exactly know why.  I know this is the one film I've been waiting to appear on DVD and it will be out in November (if that means anything to anyone).  I guess I had to write just to say that I didn't find the film as schmaltzy or...I have to say it...as bad as the other reviewer did.  They didn't say it outright but it's kind of implied.I think Bing and Danny are great in this film.  I really liked ""Holiday Inn"" as well, but I like Danny so much better than Fred Astair (if we're comparing the films and their very loosely similar stories).  I liked Rosemary Clooney and Bing playing off of each other (I just wish that Rosemary's vocals could have been included on the soundtrack.  Her version of ""Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me"" is wonderful) and Vera-Ellen (though maybe not the best actress) makes the dance numbers pop through the screen.

It has so much charm and wit! I loved it and would recommend it to anyone. My 8 year old son enjoyed it too. It is very family friendly. Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby really bring this film to life with their clever comebacks and such. The story line will have you wanting to know more every second. Even my 8 year old son (who thinks girls are yucky) was very interested in the flirtatious nature of the two couples in the film. So much charm and class. I can't praise it enough!

(if you don't believe me, ask any namvet who understands him better--his wife or the men he served with.)it presents men who are partners and who value each others opinions on how they run their business/act. it presents sisters who love each other--and are willing to give up their own dreams for each other. it presents a man who has served his country, is raising his granddaughter and now, in retirement, is about to lose everything thru the vagaries of weather.all of these people are willing to sacrifice of themselves in order to help each other. they are human and admit to making mistakes...and then rectify them.it is about love and caring and giving. it is the truest sort of Christmas story. it is about the TRUE spirit of Christmas.....and it gets there in a very entertaining way...despite whatever flaws it may have.the music is wonderful. the costumes are wonderful. the staging is entertaining.it makes me smile and warms the cockles of my heart....... we have too few movies these days that do that. especially Christmas movies.......",White Christmas

Although I was a bit disappointed that it was a very long movie, that they seemed to chase after women or so it seemed that way to me and my wife, and the movie did not really have a whole lot to do with Christmas at all. In fact not to spoil it much, the only mention of Christmas was in the last few minutes of the movie. With the exception of the very beginning.

Here in the UK this year the viewers were subjected to awful boring worn out soap operas. Films like Gone With the Wind were shown at midnight while the soaps that are on every night 365 days a years were on at PEAK time every day over the whole Christmas period. What have these planners got for brains in their heads? People want to be cheered up at Christmas not subject to watching worn out soaps showing people and kids screaming and shouting at each other. This followed by the usual police murder series. The programmes planners should have been fined here for what they subjected us all to.

Why would a general open a lodge in Vermont and then keep it going when there are no customers. The magic appeal of the leads is evident when they sing or dance but the storyline makes them seem just plain silly. The ""Sisters"" number is a classic and congratulations to the guy who persuaded Bing to leave it in the picture. Danny Kaye sings and dances but he is outdone by a professional dancer and no one sings as well as Bing Crosby. His wit and charm is not a factor in this movie. It has the loveliest melody of Berlin, ""Count your Blessings."" Other songs are less melodic but still lovely to hear in the colorful settings.

172,Oski-2,A great way to appreciate older generations,9,1 April 1999,"Every time I see White Christmas, I think of what a special generation my godparents' is.  This is a warm, admittedly sentimental movie, that just plain old makes you feel good.  Today, that is not such a bad thing.I agree with the previous post about what a great scene it is when the general walks in.  But the scene that moves me even more, and to me is a great piece of camera work, is when the cast begins singing White Christmas again (after the large doors have been opened to expose the snow).  As they sing, the camera pulls back and over the tables to show different people at each table rising to toast each other.  It is a remarkably  poignant scene for me.  Friends toasting old friends.  I tell you it brings a tear to my eye every time and makes me want to go out to dinner with friends and toast them to let them know what they have meant to me in life.  Something like this actually happened.  On my god parent's 50th anniversary, we took them for a weekend at the Lodge at Pebble Beach in Carmel.  During the dinner, someone came in and played ""I'll be Seeing You"" for them on the piano as they danced.  Wasn't a dry eye in the house.That may be a little deep for such a light movie, but it is what makes is work for me.  Any movie that makes you appreciate the important people in your life is all right in my book.  I give it 9 out of 10.",White Christmas

Not just a story of boy meet girl, fall in love etc., this film focuses on service and good holiday spirit. There is lots of great singing and some good dancing.

174,50's Chick,"A warm, delightfully festive holiday movie.",10,8 December 1999,"Irving Berlin's White Christmas is a movie that holds a special place in my heart. The music & dance numbers are fabulous, and the little comedy snipetts are super! It's a holiday movie about two Army pals (Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who join forces after WWII as a song and dance team. Their adventures take them to Florida where they meet up with a ""sister act"" (Vera-Ellen and Rosemary Clooney) who are booked for the holidays at an inn in Vermont; which turns out to be owned by the guy's old Army General. The girls and guys team up to put on a ""dianamite show"" to bring business to the inn. In the process there are songs, dances, a little ""misunderstanding"" and of course romance! I have loved this movie since I was a little girl, it's a holiday movie no one should miss. It's become a personal holiday favorite of mine I hope it turns out to be yours too!",White Christmas

Besides the stars (Bing Crosby, does it get any better), this is a wonderful film to view on Christmas, Thanksgiving, or any evening when there's a fire in the fireplace and your family is gathered around you. The music is fantastic 1950's and the dance numbers bounce out of the screen. The war was not that far from many people's minds in 1956 when this was made, so that makes is even more endearing. I doubt the twenty something's or even some thirty something's will really appreciate this until they have children or grand-children, but the reality is that the more I watch this movie the more I can appreciate the more I can identify with my parents' generation.Enjoy.

It's a film to watch on a Sunday afternoon in winter, in front of an open fire with a cup of cocoa in your hand because this is just the feel good factor it conjures. Danny Kaye and Bing Crosby are a delight together and the storyline is so heartwarming yet it doesn't slip into the saccharine sludge it might have fallen into but retains a nice comic edge.

179,jtmcwoo,My own personal movie Hell,1,23 December 2002,"My wife & I were in the Christmas spirit last night and decided to rent a Christmas DVD.  Having heard little about White Christmas other than knowing it is a classic and knowing the Christmas song by Bing Crosby, we eagerly brought this one home.SPOILERS TO FOLLOW:We are both curious as to how a movie can be considered a Christmas classic (and even have a title with 'Christmas' in it) when, of the 120 minute running time, only approximately 7 minutes of actual Christmas events/songs are included.  The other 113 minutes consisted of bad acting, horrific editing and above all... really bad music, singing, dancing etc.
I apologize to people who actually love this movie (and there appears to be quite a few!), but please, what exactly was the point of this movie?  Was there a heart warming message?  I guess one can argue the soldiers reuniting to honour the General at the end did attempt to tug at one's heart strings, but what else was there?  It appears to me that whomever approved this project was looking at showcasing Mr. Crosby's 'White Christmas' song.  It is sung at the beginning and end of the movie and as mentioned there is not much in between.I don't mean to disrespect the legends associated with the film.  My wife & I are not fans of musicals and I was aware that the majority of the film would be music & dancing.  The problem here is that it is considered a Christmas movie and I disagree.  I thought that there would be Christmas songs throughout and that just isn't the case.  Sitting through 2 hours of this is my own personal movie Hell.",White Christmas
180,legbild,A Classic!,9,28 November 2006,"It was a certain era in Hollywood and since Hollywood is all about the facade and the imagery and the not the real lives of the people that play parts, this one has always been one of my favorites. I could see how some may not like it, but having headed to Vermont from the Philadelphia area at Christmastime for many years as a child and having moved to Vermont as an adult, there is a special connection to this. It was an interesting movie as it combined stage shows wrapped around a Christmas story (giving) and packaged in a Hollywood movie. I'd rate it up there with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as one of my favorite Christmastime movies although I can see how every generation seems to grab on to their favorite stories at Christmas, be they the written word or on film. If you haven't seen it and like sentimental movies, you might like this one.",White Christmas
181,brenda_massey70,Christmas Tradition,10,20 December 2006,"White Christmas is one of those movies that has it all. I love it for the music (I am a self-professed musical theatre geek) but also for the special holiday feelings it generates (even in the middle of July). The world has become very ""informed"" and ""critical"", which I read as ""guarded"" and ""cynical"". When I watch this movie, it gives me a sense of hope. It speaks to the common good in us. To our shared humanity. Are there dire and scary events and bad things happening in the world today? Yes. Is this an exaggerated ""Hollywood"" take on a bygone era? Yes. But the messages of peace, love and looking out for each other (not to mention the wonderful tunes) are timeless. I cry for joy at the end of this movie every time. I do not apologize for that.",White Christmas

If only they made movies like this now. Danny Kaye, I think, is one of the most underrated actors ever to be on screen. He is just fantastic in everything that he does, and so natural and always looks like he's having a ball. I love the story within the story in this movie. And no matter how many times I watch it, I always have tears when General Waverly comes into the dining room and all of the men are there that served under him during the war.

""Mandy"" number is cut out. This is a dance scene so rich in color, this is what colored TV was all about.

This movie always took me back to the time I was a little boy and watched it with my mom. Hot chocolate, cookies stringing popcorn for the tree and waiting for the movie to be shown on a local station. Thank goodness we now have our favorites on VHS or DVD, so we don't have to worry about time constraints, or cutting out pivotal songs or scenes that add to great shows like this. Just talking about this movie makes me want to start decorating the whole house. I always wondered why Rosemary Clooney wasn't on the soundtrack....Peggy Lee did a good enough job, but it took something away for me....when you are used to hearing Rosie !

188,dheisenberg,Fine Xmas movie,8,23 December 2008,"Are these comments for real? Do the authors realize that this movie wasn't made in the 21st century. All movies made then, particularly the musicals seems somewhat strange in today's setting. But this was a very good movie and it doesn't matter if there wasn't a lot of fake snow, or, if virtuoso acting performances weren't given by some of the greatest acts of the day.Danny Kaye is perhaps in the top ten of all time film performers and perhaps the most multi-talented man who ever graced the screen. Vera Ellen is a dancer matched only among women by Cyd Charisse. Bing Crosby, other than singing one of the greatest Xmas songs of all time (I won't say best, even if it is the best selling) was a wonderful comic actor whose work here is of the same quality as it was in the Road movies. Rosemary Clooney, perhaps the least of the entertainers, was the best actor of the bunch. But, guess what, you critical Scrooges -- the movie was about the music and the dancing, not the plot or the fake snow or the acting.I missed this point once myself watching Oh Brother! Where art thou? I told a friend the next day after I watched it that it wasn't all that funny a comedy, but, strangely, I couldn't get the music out of my head. He said, you idiot, it's all about the music. Huh? I rented it again. What a great movie once I had my head on straight.So here's your Xmas assignment.

You can't accept this movie as great, then you ate too much fruitcake.I love this movie with all my heart. I just love the scenes, dialogue, the goofy corny stuff. Why must people be so serious all the time. Danny Kaye was masterful in this, as was Bing.I watch this movie about 15 times every year between Thanksgiving and Christmas. An uplifting, melodic movie with beautiful people with great thoughts. A must see. 10 out of 10. Vera Ellen dances with the grace of a Forrest doe, lightly on her feet. Her voice given to her is deep and trusting. I have since I was old enough to watch Rosemary Clooney in this movie, and appearing on Cincinnati's ""Bob Braun Show "". A voice so lovely, and so cute. Acting together as sisters is believable, and wholesome. I love how this movie shows kinda how life was in this time.",White Christmas

193,johnreesep,Railroad scenes in the movie,10,15 December 2013,"This is certainly one of my favorite movies during the Christmas holidays, and my family too. As a railroad train buff, I'd just like to comment on the scene when the gang is traveling by train from Florida to Vermont. The railroads they most likely would have used would have been either Seaboard Air Lines, Atlantic Coast Line, or Florida East Coast to at least New York. Then they would change railroads again to the New Haven to Boston and eventually Vermont. Instead, the director used a clip of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe's (ATSF) ""San Diegan"" passenger train as it raced along the Pacific coast between Los Angeles and San Diego. Then the film quickly showed a Southern Pacific train with ""Black Widow"" F units leading old heavy weight passenger cars speeding along near Beaumont Pass (Banning,CA) where, if you look quickly, you will spot the snow covered San Bernardino mountains in the distance. While it's not accurate as far as the railroads Hollywood could have shown here, it's still fun to see both these trains in color speeding along from so long ago. ATSF is no longer in business and has merged with Burlington Northern to form BNSF, and the Southern Pacific was swallowed up by the Union Pacific a number of years ago. Today's passenger service is, or course, Amtrak.",White Christmas

Crosby is great. Danny Kaye is my favorite guy, he was wonderful as usual. RoseMary Clooney was terrific,and what a great shape she had, and such a velvety voice, and Vera-Allen was superb in her dancing but ghastly thin. Also I thought she really played to the camera way to much, always turning toward the camera, when she should have been looking at her dance partner, or when the four of them were singing ""Snow."" I have so many different favorite parts to the movie that I love, one is Danny Kaye & Vera-Allen dancing to ""The best things happen when your dancing."" Danny's ""Choreography"" number.I like the ""Abraham,"" number, but found myself watching John Brascia more than Vera-Allen. What a talent he was. I loved watching Mary Wickes, she was such a delight. It was so cute when she kissed Danny and Bing, she held that kiss a very long time. Loved Barri Chase as Doris (Mutual I'm sure) Loved when Danny announced his engagement, when she said, I sure wish it would happen to me, the guy she was dancing with heard her say that, and quickly moved away from her.

In fact, friends from across the country join me every year in watching it simultaneously as we chat about each scene in a chat room online. We call it ""Cyber White Christmas"" - and it allows us to celebrate and type away to our hearts content as we revisit the confection each year. Yes, we understand the film is confection -- and we trust and love it to be just so.I will always smile when Danny rubs his elbow. When the Hanes Sisters come out in that heavenly blue. We'll forever gasp at Vera Ellen's skeletal frame -- and the single tap from Mandy that seems to go on forever, not to mention Betty's magnificently scalloped dress in New York as she croons ""Love, You didn't do right by me..""

Aside from some great musical numbers (esp. the dance sequences) this was an overlong snore. The plot was so convoluted for such little payoff -- all that secrecy/misunderstanding for the General's surprise party. And nothing says ""Christmas cheer and warmth"" better than a stage recreation of a bombed-out European landscape! By contrast, HOLIDAY INN, had a nicely paced inherent structure in its telling of an inn open only on holidays and some truly memorable tunes and musical numbers. That film's atmosphere and warmth seemed genuine and not wrapped up in the false sentimentality and schmaltz of the remake. The only reason to buy a DVD of WHITE Christmas would be to have the ability to skip to the dance scenes.",White Christmas
