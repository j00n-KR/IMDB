0,MartinHafer,Beautiful to look at but a bit empty,7,19 August 2007,"This is the story of a strange dystopic society--one that is like many different time periods and countries rolled into one--much like you might see on a parallel Earth. While most of the people speak in English or American accents (something that, oddly, wasn't consistent), the setting seemed like a combination of a Communist state and that of Oceania from ""1984"". In this awful and repressive society are two main story threads--one involving the plight of poor Mr. Buttle who is accidentally imprisoned, tortured and killed due to a clerical error. The other, and more predominant theme involves bureaucrat Jonathan Pryce as a man who day dreams much like Walter Mitty--but in each case he dreams of the same thing--flying like a bird and rescuing his lady love. However, Pryce has no girlfriend or wife and this woman seems purely a figment of his imagination until he accidentally meets a truck driver who looks like this woman. Unfortunately, when these two story lines meet, the lady love is doomed and it's up to Pryce to save her.The film is interspersed with lots of bizarre vignettes designed to illustrate just how stupid and pointless this bureaucratic state has become. Some of these are really weird, funny and visually exciting and are way too many to discuss here. However, after a while it seemed like all this weird aspects really tended to distract from the central story and made the movie very long.I actually took the trouble to see this movie twice--once when it first came out and now again, more than twenty years later. While I didn't particularly enjoy the movie when it first came out, I thought I'd try again as my tastes in films has definitely evolved since then. Unfortunately, while I appreciate much of the film, I still don't see it as the artistic masterpiece some proclaim it to be. On the positive side, director Gilliam made a film that is very unique--something you'd never see Hollywood make. I can respect that as well as the film's unusual artistry. However, at the same time, I was disturbed by the mountain of cash that was infused into this story, as you probably could have made ten very good films for the same cost! Yes, it was beautiful to see the scenes of Jonathan Pryce as an Icarus-like flying man and the city scenes were quite impressive but the story itself was a bit dead and overlong. To me it seems very ironic that many consider this an ""art film"", but like most Hollywood productions, the film put so much energy on the visuals and special effects that the story itself seemed a bit irrelevant at times.Overall, it's an amazing film to see but one that left me feeling a bit empty. Despite Gilliam's very public protests about his film being cut to pieces by the studio, on the studio's behalf I must say that the director's cut was too long, too disjoint and simply cost too much. With the funds at Gilliam's disposal, it's really no surprise that this film looks good, but as for me, give me a little film with characters I can connect with instead. To make a comparison, I just saw a small independent film, JANICE BEARD, and I enjoyed it much more than BRAZIL yet it probably cost about 1/20 or less to make!",Brazil
1,TheLittleSongbird,"I agree, this is Terry Gilliam's masterpiece",10,3 July 2011,"I like Terry Gilliam, I appreciate his style and I like his films. As much as I am fond of Time Bandits and The Adventures of Baron Manchausen, two childhood favourites, and also Twelve Monkeys, I consider Brazil Gilliam's masterpiece.On a visual and technical level, Brazil is outstanding. The cinematography and effects are well and truly exemplary, as is the make up, but I loved the authentic sound and the genuine atmosphere Brazil exuded.Michael Kamen is a composer that I have a lot of respect for, and Brazil is no exception. His score is both of beautiful and haunting quality and really helps to enhance the atmosphere. The story does have a simplicity and complexity, it has a wonderful idea, has something to say and explores it well.The script also impresses. It is thoughtful and deep, but it also has its funny moments of the subtle kind. Gilliam's direction is superb too. The acting is really tremendous. I loved Robert DeNiro, Ian Richardson and Jim Broadbent here and Kim Griest gives a performance of considerable depth avoiding any signs of blandness, but the picture acting-wise belongs to Jonathan Pryce. Pryce is just superb in this film, and while he has done a lot of solid work such as Regeneration, The Ploughman's Lunch and The Adventures of Baron Manchausen I think the role of Sam Lowry from Brazil is his best performance.I can understand why some mayn't like Brazil. It is a lengthy movie, people might find they like the idea but find there isn't enough to say or they even mayn't like Gilliam and his style. I will admit I did find myself frustrated on first viewing three years ago, loving the idea but found myself confused, but now I both love and appreciate Brazil and not only consider it Gilliam's masterpiece but also one of the better movies of the 80s.Overall, outstanding but perhaps not a movie you should see just once. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Brazil
2,Leofwine_draca,"A satirical, one-of-a-kind dystopian masterwork",9,13 December 2015,"This masterwork from Terry Gilliam is by far the director's best work - forget the overrated TWELVE MONKEYS - and the highpoint of actor Jonathan Pryce's career. As to be expected from an ex-MONTY PYTHON member, this is bizarre and unusual stuff that demands concentration, and a truly unique piece of work. At its heart, the film is a black comedy that mocks modern society - by setting it in the future, Gilliam is able to exaggerate the flaws of '80s society and follow them through to an extreme but logical conclusion - as well as having all kinds of outlandish humour to enjoy. Elements of adventure, action, romance and horror are mixed expertly into the proceedings and every minute of this two hour-plus film is gripping.At its heart, the film is a satirical adaptation of Orwell's 1984, except far more complex - multiple viewings are demanding to fully appreciate Gilliam's masterpiece. Everything about the film is flawless - the music, the acting, the visuals, the twists and turns of the story. Sitting here now, a day after viewing the film, I can't think of a single fault with it. At first the running time put me off (I'm not a fan of long films at all) but it couldn't be shortened in any way. Animator Gilliam has created some unique and often stunning visuals for his movie. Take for example the exotic dream sequences are incredible stuff. The cityscape couldn't be any bleaker - a grey mess, full of rotting rubbish in corners and brainwashed people going through the exact same motions every single day. The humour comes frequent, ranging from in-jokes with the characters to blackly humorous stuff (the coffin/corpse sequence is very dark indeed, but hilarious) and is always spot on.Jonathan Pryce is a revelation as Sam Lowry, and his performance reminds me of John Cleese's turn in the much smaller-scale CLOCKWISE - that of a man gradually driven out of his mind by circumstance until he ends up a lunatic. The supporting cast of British veterans is wonderful, with cameos from the likes of Jim Broadbent, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Peter Vaughan, Ian Richardson and Ian Holm. Robert De Niro in particular shines as a crazy terrorist plumber called Archibald ""call me Harry"" Tuttle. BRAZIL is an often surprising and breathtaking movie - every scene screams expense and style, you'll believe that Gilliam had no limit to the money he spent on making it all work. An epic of a movie, which should be required viewing for all movie watchers as one of the most offbeat and weird works of genius ever put on screen.",Brazil
3,SnoopyStyle,Original vision,10,16 March 2015,"It's Terry Gilliam's alternative surreal vision of ""somewhere in the 20th century"". The world is controlled by a bureaucracy with lots of ducts that is attacked by terrorists. A dead fly causes a detention order altered from Tuttle to Buttle. Jill Layton (Kim Greist) tries to help his imprisoned downstairs neighbor Buttle. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a helpless lowly bureaucrat at the Department of Records who sees Jill as the woman from his dreams and willingly works anonymously despite his mother (Katherine Helmond)'s meddling. His incompetent boss Mr. Kurtzmann (Ian Holm) discovers the mistake which luckily isn't their fault. Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro) is an unauthorized duct worker considered to be a terrorist.The vision is one of the most imaginative. Every detail is included. This is a visual masterpiece from the alternate mind of Terry Gilliam. The Orwellian world completes the vision into a work of substance. Jonathan Pryce is perfect as the sincere everyman in a world of overpowering bureaucracy. It takes the dark gloom of the 1984-like world and injects a fun sarcastic humor. It is something unique and beautiful.",Brazil
4,Hitchcoc,Forget About a Sustained Plot,9,3 May 2021,"I remember when I religiously watched Siskel and Ebert do their thing, first on public television and then commercially. I recall their review of this film. At the time there was no theatre near me where I could watch it. I was a Monty Python fan and saw the film as well. But the clips shown on that show decades ago have stayed with me to this day. So when I saw it available on Netflix, I ordered it. Obviously, this film is not for everyone. Like the Python bits, break it into sections and wait for the joke, then move on. At first the scatter approach made it difficult to attend, but eventually, I started getting into the rhythm of it. Don't even try to describe this film to a person with little imagination. A word that keeps coming up is ""stupid."" That could be said by naysayers of the Marx Brothers or Woody Allen or you name it. There is a wonderfully surreal sense to this. I see people have used 1984 for comparison and I guess that is valid since government and industry have made the rules here. But there are hilarious moments and touching ones. Also, there is a portrayals of a future of selfishness single mindedness. Sound familiar? Anyway, after some 35 years, it was worth the wait.",Brazil
5,kosmasp,Great movie!,10,5 February 2007,"I didn't really know what to write as a headline, so I chose the simple way out. But I really love this movie. It's really great and it's all thanks to the visionary Terry Gilliam.All matches so good together (catchy music, good actors incl. an appearance by De Niro, great sets and a wonderful story). It blends all together as a perfect movie.But I'm only talking about the director's cut of the movie. The producers made another cut of that film, where they changed many things (I won't get into details). The producer's cut is shorter. If I'm not mistaken it was 120 minutes long and Terry's version was about 142 minutes long.If you have the chance grab the Criterion Collection, where you'll also find out, everything about the battle/struggle Terry G. had to go through for his vision of the movie! You'll also find both the producer's and the director's cut on that DVDs.I'll leave you with that, while I'll be humming/singing the main theme (Brazil ....)",Brazil
6,classicsoncall,"""It's alright, I don't like you either.""",5,3 March 2018,"I like good satire and parody, but the Monty Python style of humor wears me out and just doesn't work for this viewer. The only one I ever came close to liking was 'The Holy Grail'. Watching this picture I tended to zone out from time to time, it played like a stream of random nonsense instead of a coherent story and I just got tired of it very quickly. Still, I hung in there because that's what I do as a prerequisite to commenting on it here on IMDb. I will admit to being amused by Robert De Niro's turn as 'heating engineer' Harry Tuttle, only because I've never seem him do anything so absurd before. And the supervisor attempting to catch all his worker bee employees slacking off was cleverly done, but those moments of genuine humor seemed few and far between. The rest of it was either way over the top or intellectually boring, something one might experience in a nightmarish fever dream. I don't do well with those either.",Brazil
7,gavin6942,Gilliam and His Bizarre Retro-Future,7,15 January 2015,"A bureaucrat in a retro-future world tries to correct an administrative error and himself becomes an enemy of the state.What does this film provide us? First, a very unusual role for Robert DeNiro, far outside of his gangster specialty. And second, a great ""early"" role for Bob Hoskins, years before he was made prominent in such films as ""Hook"", ""Roger Rabbit"" and ""Super Mario"". Gilliam handles these two just as well, or better, as he handled Robin Williams.When you have the Criterion 3-disc set, you are offered two different cuts. The original, and a much shorter, much happier version. Both have their merits and both give us this unusual work that Gilliam was trying to craft. Sure, he prefers one over the other, and the director should be respected, but sometimes alternate cuts allow us to experience a film differently -- watching the short one may even change the way you see the long one on a second viewing.",Brazil
8,lee_eisenberg,Could this come true?,10,27 September 2005,"We've all seen movies portraying a totalitarian future, but ""Brazil"" probably does the best job. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a drone in a future England bureaucratically run by corporations. Most appliances don't work, there are terrorist attacks everywhere, and the police wear Nazi suits. After Sam tries to correct a mistake, the government brands him an enemy.Every aspect of this movie is impressive. The ductwork is almost like a character in and of itself, as are Sam's fantasies. Robert DeNiro has a really funny supporting role as a repairman...or something like that. Good support also comes from Kim Greist, Ian Holm, Katharine Helmond, Michael Palin and Bob Hoskins (whose character has a most unusual name). See it.",Brazil
9,jboothmillard,Brazil,9,30 August 2007,"Directed by ex-Monty Python member Terry Gilliam (The Fisher King, Twelve Monkeys) this is an extraordinary masterpiece. Set ""somewhere in the 20th Century"" it is a hellish futuristic bureaucratic world, and the moment that sets a story in motion is when a squashed fly falls into the typing machine that is printing the name of a wanted terrorist, and one form accidentally prints 'Buttle' instead of 'Tuttle'. Sam Lowry (Tomorrow Never Dies' Jonathan Pryce) is the low-level government employee who has to deal with this incident of a misprinted form that lead to the troops killing an innocent man. Sam does not cope very easily with the world he lives in, he hates the system, and the only way he can escape his stress is in his dreams, where he is a winged knight-type hero fighting for the girl. He is shocked to see the girl he has been dreaming of, Jill Layton (Throw Momma from the Train's Kim Greist), and he is struggling to find some happiness. Most of the characters, including Sam's mother, Mrs. Ida Lowry (Katherine Helmond), friend Jack Lint (Michael Palin) and Dr. Jaffe (Jim Broadbent) seem to have no trouble with the world they live in, and other characters including Mr. M. Kurtzmann (Sir Ian Holm), repairman Spoor (Bob Hoskins), Mr. Warrenn (Ian Richardson) and Mr. Eugene Helpmann (Peter Vaughan) are trying to help it to stay as 'normal' as possible, Archibald 'Harry' Tuttle (Robert De Niro), the man they are looking for, seems to be the only person who also has issues with this world. The films seems to go more and more bizarre and confusing as it continues, and the conclusion with Jack as the villain, and Sam trapped forever in a dream state is enough to give you nightmares. Also starring Barbara Hicks as Mrs. Alma Terrain, Charles McKeown as Harvey Lime, Derrick O'Connor as Dowser, Kathryn Pogson as Shirley, Bryan Pringle as Spiro and Sheila Reid as Mrs. Buttle. Even if the story is confusing and there is a lot of concentration required, I think this is a brilliant film, based on this vision of the nightmarish future, the many great British (and one American) actors, and the visual effects are marvellous, it is one of those films you simply can't ignore. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects. It was number 47 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 38 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!",Brazil
10,Woodyanders,The need and desire to escape,9,21 March 2019,"Meek and hapless working class average guy Sam Lowry (a superb and sympathetic performance by Jonathan Pryce) yearns to escape via dreams from the oppressive totalitarian society that he feels trapped and confined in.Director Terry Gilliam, who also co-wrote the biting script with Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown, pokes savagely mocking fun at the pettiness, ineptitude, and stifling conformist nature of bureaucracy, maintains a deliciously dark'n'droll tone throughout, and presents a vivid and ingeniously designed alternative world that's both retro and futuristic in equal measure (in an especially inspired touch, the advanced technology in this world keeps on either malfunctioning or breaking down). Moreover, Gilliam further offers a touching and rousing ode to the triumph of the human spirit against extremely grim and daunting odds.The sterling acting from the top-rate cast keeps this film humming: Robert De Niro as jolly domestic terrorist Harry Tuttle, Katherine Helmond as Sam's vain mother Ida, Ian Holm as uptight superior Mr. Kurtzmann, Bob Hoskins as vengeful repairman Spoor, Michael Palin as merry torturer Jack Lint, Kim Griest as feisty truck driver Jill Layton, Peter Vaughan as the doddery Mr. Helpman, and Jim Broadbent as proud plastic surgeon Dr. Jaffe. Roger Pratt's striking cinematography and Michael Kamen's jaunty score both score complete bull's eyes. But it's the quirky way this movie caters to the imagination and depicts man's capacity to dream with such bracing wit and joy that in turn gives this picture a tremendous surplus of pure heart and appeal. An offbeat treat.",Brazil
11,Tweekums,A dystopian bureaucracy,10,2 February 2012,"Sam Lowry is a dreamer; he is also a bureaucrat working at the Ministry of Information, he rather likes his job despite it being in a dead end department. That is until one day he has to take a refund to a woman whose husband was arrested by mistake; here he meets the person who is quite literally the woman of his dreams. He tries to look up her details at work but can't access her files; to do that he'd have to be in 'Information Retrieval' and it just so happened that he'd recently been offered a job there... he had turned it down but he finds the position is still open. This may sound like the plot from a romcom apart from the fact that it is set in a dystopian future where everybody must have the right form to do anything and if they don't they can expect an SAS style assault followed by torture.The film has a great look; everything looks as though it is from the 1950s, things do not work as they should; in fact everything is grey and oppressive; it is little wonder that Lowry escapes into vivid dreams where he soars above a beautiful green landscape. Dystopias are usually shown as highly efficient fascist states where any dissenting view is oppressed; here the bureaucracy and inefficiency seem almost more oppressive. Jonathon Pryce does a great job as Lowry; the man with dreams but no ambition. The rest of the cast contains many well known faces including Ian Holm, Ian Richardson, Michael Palin, Bob Hoskins, Peter Vaughn and Robert De Niro who plays freelance plumber/terrorist Harry Tuttle. Surprisingly for such a dark film there are plenty of laughs; the fate of two Central Services operatives is as hilarious as it is disgusting! Thankfully director Terry Gilliam was able to block the studio interference which means there is no happy ending... it wouldn't be a proper dystopian fantasy with a happy ending!",Brazil
12,Quinoa1984,"one of Terry Gilliam's, and the 80's, most audacious, take it or leave it works of auteur cinema",10,27 October 2002,"Brazil's protagonist is Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce, who perfectly captures a man trapped in circumstance), a computer worker who sees control all over, but it is constantly in-efficient. Such as when he has a broken vent in his apartment, and in sneaks in a heating engineer named Tuttle (Robert De Niro, who is under-used in this film as he appears for all of three minutes), who is supposed to be brought in when a mistake is made and a Mr. Buttle is captured. When Lowry visits the home of Buttle to get a signature and looks up into the circular hole in the ceiling, he sees the reality version of the woman from his dreams, Jill Layton, and now sees a spark of light in his muck of life.While Brazil, writer/director Terry Gilliam's throwback to Orwell's 1984, seems like it will be so on the outset, the film- having asked of us to think about it, is more than that. This is a film that I watched on a morning years ago when I had only seen a few other Gilliam films, and the reaction was similar: visceral, loaded with information with the visuals, and often very funny, but not really a masterpiece of a first go-around. But this, like Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas (perhaps my favorite of his work, non Python), gains more attention to details, and more laughs and emotional output, on repeat viewings. It's certainly his most audacious work on such a low budget (at least it is when you look at the real numbers; the look of the film seems much higher, like a Jim Henson fantasy or something). But even Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Twelve Monkeys, which have a crazed zest in their visual qualities and wit (co-written by ultra-acclaimed Tom Stoppard) can't really compare (or rather isn't fair to compare) to the images here. Brazil is a city of despair, control, and meticulous, gloomy craft, and Lowry's escapes in his dreamworld are sweeping in true fantasy fashion, like something out of a darker fairy tale from the early 20th century. He laces his images with often wicked satire and while towards the end the logic starts to leak more than it should, the atmosphere is unquestionably Gilliam. Not everyone may get it on the first viewing, and indeed this is probably what affected much of the controversy when it came out (see The Battle of Brazil, or read the book, for more on that shebang), but it's hard to dismiss it with other studio fare of the period. Art will either turn people on immensely, or perplex them and sort of disgust them while keeping an odd fascination. Like the dreams of he hero, the layers of style (there's fantasy/sci-fi, but also the bleak, dark perfection of film-noir) and content. Those who think that a film made by a Python alumni will be hokey and too ludicrous to take seriously will get a chance to see a unique, demented-en-regalia work. At the least, very few will show indifference...I think (and at least, you'll be humming the theme song once it's through).",Brazil
13,sunwarrior13,Memorable And Distinctive Film,10,22 February 2015,"Brazil is a film that tells the story of Sam Lowry,a man who is a trying to find the woman who appears in his dreams while working.It features Jonathan Pryce together with Robert De Niro,Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins, and Ian Holm.Written by its director Terry Gilliam together with Charles McKeown, and Tom Stoppard,this film has a futuristic consumer-driven dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poor maintained machines which is reminiscent of the government of George Orwell's novel,1984. This is a movie that could be considered way ahead of its time during its release back in the 1980's.It is influenced by the likes of Kafka,Orwell, and Kubrick, this darkly humorous futuristic satire is definitely witty and has great imaginative features that viewers today will still surely enjoy and appreciate.Finally,it is definitely memorable and distinctive.",Brazil
14,Hey_Sweden,This film takes you on an incredible journey.,8,31 May 2021,"Considered by some to be filmmaker Terry Gilliams' masterpiece, ""Brazil"" is a stunning film in many ways. Clearly, no expense was spared in creating this memorable Dystopian future, in which an average-man protagonist, low-level bureaucrat Sam Lowry (an endearing Jonathan Pryce) is content not to be too ambitious. He works for an all-powerful, oppressive organization known as the Ministry of Information, and one day he glimpses a lovely young woman (Kim Greist as Jill Layton) with whom he becomes obsessed. This is because she resembles the damsel in distress in his dreams; Sam finds refuge in a rich fantasy life.A top-notch cast really makes this sing. They include Robert De Niro as trouble-making person of interest Harry Tuttle, Katherine Helmond as Sams' high-society mother, Ian Holm as his nervous supervisor, Bob Hoskins as a character named ""Spoor"", Michael Palin as Sams' good friend Jack Lint, Ian Richardson as the officious Mr. Warrenn, and Peter Vaughan as the genial Mr. Helpmann. Other familiar faces in small roles include Jim Broadbent, Barbara Hicks, and Derrick O'Connor; co-screenwriter Charles McKeown plays a co-worker named Lime. But it's Pryce and his sympathetic portrayal that truly helps to anchor this tale and keep it compelling for almost two and a half hours.Gilliam and company do an amazing job of world-building, with eye-popping production design (by Norman Garwood) and visual effects. The theme still resonates decades later, of a suspect government that is determined to keep people in line, drowning all of its employees in paperwork and officialese. And they seek to stifle anybody who goes against the grain, like Mr. Tuttle (De Niro makes the most of limited screen time) or the appealing Ms. Layton (Greist never had another role as good as this one). The music score by Michael Kamen is also first-rate. Gilliam, his fellow writers (playwright Tom Stoppard and Mr. McKeown), and the talented crew are always coming up with inventive and funny bits of business. This film is truly like nothing else this viewer has seen, and that's a good thing.With an ultimately grim outlook on future society, ""Brazil"" is striking entertainment that any fan of this genre is sure to find quite interesting. Darkly humorous, satiric, and even poignant, it's one of those films that sticks with you after it's over.Eight out of 10.",Brazil

16,Boba_Fett1138,Unique strange imaginative movie.,9,20 February 2006,"There certainly is no other movie like ""Brazil"" and therefor it's a very unique one to watch, that is hard to describe. It's something you have to experience for yourself really.The movie is an absolutely fascinating one, thanks to its visuals and strange imaginatively story. The movie is set in a strange alternative futuristic society, that is completely being controlled by the government. The sets and costumes look like they come from the '30's, while everything else in the movie is very high-tech futuristic like. It gives the movie an unique feeling and atmosphere.It's hard really to describe the story because it's so multi-layered. everyone will interpreted the elements and visuals of the movie differently. It really is an imaginative movie that forces us to use our brain and own imagination. The visuals and story of the movie make sure we do so. The story has especially some great elements in it, such as the terrorism and the way the bureaucracy is portrayed in the movie. It's done all very over-the-top but it makes its point.Jonathan Pryce is very believable in his role and he is a good main lead for the movie. Robert De Niro, Bob Hoskins and also Ian Holm show up in some small but very fun roles. Kim Greist however can't really act and she was quite distracting at times.It all is masterfully directed by Terry Gilliam, who obviously is no stranger of making strange but yet unique and fascinating movies. The costumes and sets of the movie are extremely good and give the movie its unique feeling and atmosphere. Also the musical score by Michael Kamen is fun and good.It obviously is no movie for just everyone but those who have a vivid imagination and like to be stimulated by a movie will be absolutely delighted by this movie. For them this is simply an absolute must-see and near-masterpiece.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Brazil
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Can't make a move without a form,10,4 April 2010,"This is a review of the 132 minute version; I haven't tried to watch the cut version of an hour and a half myself, but I hear that it is one to avoid(and I can't see how this could all be trimmed down to that and still be good). This is, as others have already stated, Orwell as done by a Monty Python troupe member(and, let's be honest, probably the one with the wildest imagination). The world, perhaps not as distant as we'd like, presented in this is one where technology, bureaucracy(paperwork, many different departments, sterile and ominous buildings/interiors... it's all spot-on), consumerism and superficiality have run rampant. It is also a world where suspicion of terrorism has led to expansive government control, making it even more relevant today than it was when it was released. The story is entirely coherent(why do people keep saying the opposite about this? Where and when did this confuse you, plot-wise?) and surprisingly engaging for there not particularly being characters we can relate to, and barely any we can like(I firmly believe Terry enjoys writing obnoxious roles). The dream-sequences don't relate that much to what's going on(with that said, they're beautifully done, and you can't argue with all the symbolism in them). This has plenty of unforgettable images, and for several of them, your first impression of what you're seeing soon proves to be wrong. The editing and cinematography are amazing. FX are marvelous, I was very impressed. This treats its serious subject matter with humor along with the depressing and unsettling 'reality' of it. The jokes and gags are based in absurdity, pitch black comedy, cleverness and verbal material, and most of the time, it is hilarious(if you're into aforementioned styles). It is excessively disgusting and rather mean-spirited to the handicapped and others, and it is not for everyone. The acting is excellent, other than the kids. As the cover of my copy lists DeNiro and Hoskins(alongside with Pryce), I feel compelled to reveal that the former is not in this a lot, and the latter isn't exactly a lead, either. All three are flawless in their performances. There is constant disturbing content, a bit of brutal violence, infrequent strong language and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a 28 minute featurette which I will review on its own page here on the site and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of dystopian settings, Kafka, 1984 and/or Gilliam. Bizarre, incredibly visually creative and quite depressing. I love it. 10/10",Brazil
18,view_and_review,Where are the Whys and the Whats?,3,16 January 2020,"Whereas I did watch this movie start to finish I did so half-heartedly. It's hard to be interested in something you don't fully understand.In this Monty Python version of the future the country is run by a super-bureaucracy. There are infinite layers of government with infinite amounts of paperwork. Sam Lowry is one measly bureaucrat amongst a plethora of bureaucrats. He attempts to break free from the system when he meets the girl of his dreams. I mean his literal dreams. He quite literally met the girl he'd been dreaming about though he had no idea she existed.""Brazil"" was much like a dream which is a montage of random events and instantly jumps from one thing to another. This was a pain to watch because even if I knew what was going on I didn't know why. And if I knew why, I didn't know what. To add to the misery, there was an obnoxious soundtrack that set a satirical mood and was immensely overbearing. It rudely set the mood without consideration. This was yet another British film that I couldn't connect with.",Brazil
19,evanston_dad,It's Monty Python Meets George Orwell and Aldous Huxley,9,8 April 2008,"An audacious film, and one that was just born to be a cult classic.I've only seen ""Brazil"" once, but once was enough to make me fall in love with it, and I'm sure it's the kind of movie that just gets better and better the more you see it. Jonathan Pryce plays the man trapped in a dystopian future that looks like something out of Monty Python by way of George Orwell. Visionary director Terry Gilliam creates a fantastic visual world, and a host of great actors appear in small roles -- Robert De Niro has an especially memorable scene as a repair man.And I give Gilliam tremendous credit for sticking to his guns and giving us a downbeat ending in the director's cut.Grade: A",Brazil
20,Aaron1375,"Good, but also a bit to long.",7,24 January 2010,"I enjoyed this movie a bit, but it is a rather long movie. It is also a bit bizarre, but look who is making it. The bizarre part though is not a bad thing. It is bizarre like the movie ""Zardoz"" is bizarre. The strangeness of the film actually helps it reach new heights and makes it so that the length of the film is more tolerable. The film is about some sort of strange future or possibly another world entirely where this man is living in some sort of place where the government is a bit of a totalitarian type government. He has what looks like a office type job in a rather different type of place and he is going through some different type times. He sees a girl though that he falls madly in love with as she is the one he dreams about in these very strange, but surprisingly well done sequences where he has wings and must battle strange things. Honestly, I am not really doing the film much justice, but it is so hard to describe, which is one of the appeals of this movie. If it was a bit shorter and the ending a bit less dreary I would have liked it more maybe, or maybe a little less. There are some stars in this one, but no one really big as Robert DeNiro is probably the biggest and he really only has what amounts to a cameo appearance. Still, they are not unknowns in this film, just more the type you see in a supporting role. So all in all a rather surreal film that was strange and rather good. Just not good in a way that I wish to see the movie a lot, more like maybe once every couple of years or so. That way you forget stuff and the movie still has that strange bite to it.",Brazil
21,Mr-Fusion,A tough nut to crack,6,10 November 2021,"It's not every day that a movie leaves me feeling conflicted. Normally, a rating will swing favorable or unfavorable and that's that; clear cut. But Brazil? I think I enjoy discussing the movie rather than watching it. And it's not as simple as saying it's too long, or it was a great idea just clumsily executed.There are wonderful moments, scenes, and set pieces within this film and it will not fail to leave an impression. Much of what happens in this horrible future is far too absurd, just so comically awful and I love the sense of humor. I love that Gilliam's Orwellian nightmare is thanks to the pencil-pushers; misery through bureaucracy, paperwork über alles!The look of this particular dystopia is both Blade Runner and that 1984 Apple commercial. This is a towering achievement in set design that cannot be ignored, and you could easily get lost in the background details. I think we can all agree with the visuals and overall aesthetic. That's not the problem.It's the characters. Now don't get me wrong, part of why I love the first act is because of the supporting players. Bob Hoskins and Robert De Niro especially. But eventually we move past those people and the film focuses on the core love story: Jonathan Pryce's dogged pursuit of his dream woman Kim Greist. Pryce is perfect when he's interacting with his insane surroundings, but it's in his quest that the movie really sags. Again, it's not as simple as saying it's boring but the second and third acts pale in comparison to the film's earlier moments. As much as I wanted our protagonist to succeed and find happiness, that journey felt more grind than search. Once the final plot twist was reached, I felt like I'd completed something rather than enjoyed it. And this is a feeling I honestly did not expect.Many years back, I read Jack Matthews' book on the making of this movie; itself more interesting to me than the actual film. That sounds callous, I know, but the time spent talking about Brazil I'd more engaging than the actual watch. It has a wacky setting, exceptional set design, but characterization isn't there.For a comedy, I was tasked more than I was entertained. Deep down, I know I'll revisit this in the future (that's just me), but I also know I'll need to be in the right mindset for it.",Brazil
22,christopher-underwood,I find this hard to get into and enjoy,6,24 March 2021,"For something that so much loving effort and sheer hard work has obviously gone into and me just shrug seems incredibly churlish, and yet I find this hard to get into and enjoy. The main problem, for me, is at root a mixing of three well intentioned but seemingly disparate scripts. Terry Gilliam's full on madcap and free reign surreal dream madness would never have attracted enough money for the awesome set building and special effects required. Tom Stoppard's cerebral contribution clearly took the fun out of it as far as the director was concerned and slapstick man Charles McKeown must have brought back some of the 'silliness' that some of us cannot help but perceive. So, in the end it is a compromise and some bits work better than others whilst the whole struggles for identity. Jonathan Price seems to struggle with a lack of charisma, although it was probably Gilliam's intention to have an 'ordinary man' at he centre. Michael Palin is very effective indeed and Robert De Niro most effective in a modest role. It is the look and, often, stage musical feel that propels this extraordinary extravaganza to its inconclusive conclusion.",Brazil
23,MovieAddict2016,"""1984"" Redux - a Gilliam masterpiece, clever and cynical.",10,23 November 2005,"Note: I originally submitted a review of ""Brazil"" two years ago. I gave it a negative rating. I didn't like it. I said it was ""weird,"" silly, and ruined by a lousy middle-section.Then I began my Gilliam fix and became more familiar with his work. I saw ""Brazil"" again and liked it much, much more and came to appreciate the dark humor.The story is about a worker named Sam Lowry (Pryce), who exists in a futuristic hell and is sent into a downward spiral after becoming caught up in the affairs of a mysterious dream woman (Kim Griest) and a couple of mistaken identities involving a man named Harry Tuttle (De Niro).This is what I wrote of ""Brazil"" in 2003: ""The beginning of the film is fairly good, with good atmosphere and visual effects, but Gilliam soon takes us into the mind of Lowry halfway through the film, and it turns into a grim psychological thriller with a bunch of dead ends and forgotten ideas. Sam's dream sequences, which have him dressed in an angelic armor with big white-feathered wings, are beautiful to look at...but what else are they good for?"" I disagree with this now. It's true, the film changes courses - but for the better. I guess I didn't really ""get it"" the first time.The film features an all-star cast, including Bob Hoskins, Ian Holm, Michael Palin, and of course Mr. Robert De Niro (who is second credited but does nothing but three or four brief cameos in the film).I will freely admit that I saw the European version of ""Brazil,"" which reportedly varies from the original US theatrical cut in a number of ways. There is an added sex scene, the ending is different (no clouds), and there are at least five scenes added to the version (it stands at some 140 minutes compared to the 131-minute US cut). So with that in mind, perhaps I'd enjoy the director's cut even more.In fact, there are supposedly somewhere around 30 versions of the film out there, including a ""happy"" version aired on network television in the States (it reminds me of ""Gremlins 2,"" when the announcer claims that ""Casablanca"" is now complete with ""a happier ending.""), and a 97-minute ""Love Conquers All"" version, handled carefully by Gilliam and available for the die hard fans on the soon-to-be-discontinued Criterion Collection DVD.",Brazil
24,KineticSeoul,Somber and imaginative film,8,6 January 2017,"This is a classic dystopian tale about a average guy with below average looks. Who isn't trying to do anything really heroic for society but seeking his own happiness and pleasure going off into his own world. This is to escape from the bureaucratic world with a beautiful woman. This is a surreal movie with unique visual style and cinematography. Just about every moments in this film is absurd, which adds to the commentary on society. Well at least the director Terry Gilliam's view on society. All the really well timed scenes with it's details add to it's themes of chaos and capitalism, reality vs fantasy. Which really does delve into things for what it is. For instance some viewers might think of movies as a form of escapism but is also haunted by reality which can be a nightmare. It can be a very pessimistic and depressing film but it's creativity, psychological themes makes it highly watchable. This is a film that isn't for everyone like Terry Gilliam's other films. It's a somber and imaginative film that is ahead of it's time.8.3/10",Brazil
25,cherold,Flip side of The Trial that was once truly butchered for television,8,11 June 2005,"I originally saw Brazil years ago when it was first on TV, and it was a muddled mess. This turned out to be an edited version known either as ""love conquers all"" or the Sheinberg version (for the guy who butchered the movie), in which an hour is chopped out, the ending is completely changed and the fantasy sequences are excised.Even though I was told this afterwords, I did not seek out the proper version, because I hadn't liked Gilliam's previous movie Time Bandits. Between Brazil and Time Bandits I took to thinking of Gilliam as a director I didn't care much for, but at a certain point I realized I had liked almost everything he had made since Brazil, so I finally decided to watch the movie as envisioned by Gilliam.The movie is sort of the flip side of Kafka's The Trial, looking at the bureaucracy not from without but from within, and it is dark, surreal and satirical. And dark, which is worth mentioning twice.I didn't love this movie as much as a lot of people, but it is engrossing, if a little long, and the last 20 minutes or so is truly stupendous.This all makes me incredibly resentful of the butchered version, which was apparently originally going to be released theatrically, was squelched in favor of the original but then somehow wound up as the television version. The thing is, I still remembered bits of Brazil and knew the ending so I didn't get the full impact of this movie; it was ruined for me to some extent by seeing the bad version. People like Sheinberg should not be allowed near anything described as cinema, and in a just world he would be producing public service announcements or something. People like him are everything that is wrong with Hollywood, and he did real damage to Gilliam, since I am sure there are plenty of people like me for whom the bad version has colored their view of the director.Definitely worth seeing, even if I feel it's a just slightly overrated and not as good as some of Gilliams other films.",Brazil
26,lost-in-limbo,A visual masterpiece,10,16 April 2005,"In a futuristic world Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) a gawky bureaucrat clerk gets himself caught in the middle of a revolution all because of an error, where terrorists lead by Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro) are out to destroy the bureaucratic governing state and also his literally after the girl of his dreams.A totally grim and surreal fantasy is portrayed in co-writer/director Terry Gilliam's film. The bleak world that we see is truly bizarre and visually astonishing, by representing a domineering world run by an unfair bureaucracy and technology that has gone chaotic- because of obsession, daily routines and power. Its a materialistic society thats filled with unfair rules and regulations. The special effects are spellbinding with the gizmos and gadgets that flow through the film. The engaging screenplay is excellent in representing the disturbing life style of this future and the script filled with sharp satire and amusing black humour and wit. The set and art direction is nothing but breathtaking, while the plot might have it's flaws- but the superb detail and imagination that went into it you just glaze over it. The plot itself is filled with many interesting sub-plots on technology, the government system, pleasures of this life-style and terrorism- but also there are some subtle details that may go unnoticed- but with repeat viewings you catch onto them. The story has it's tense, mysterious and macabre moments that seem to gel perfectly, while the dream sequences that Sam has were simply splendid and very hypnotic and the same goes for the haunting music score that spirals with emotion.The performances were good and quite colourful- but nothing really spectacular, Jonathan Pryce is charming as the love struck Sam; Kim Greist is elegantly mysterious as Jill Layton the girl Sam's after, Robert De Niro as a chirpy plumber/terrorist Tuttle, Bob Hospkins as Spoor the repair man, Katherine Helmond as the obsessive mother of Sam Mrs. Ida Lowry and Ian Holm as the twitchy Mr. M. Kurtzmann.This is a brilliant and innovative Sci-fi film. Though it's long, but never dull and it leaves you wanting more at the end. It definitely leaves a significant impression well, it did on me.",Brazil
27,Lejink,Nuts about Brazil,8,15 December 2011,"I'm not a great one for sci-fi themed moves and I'm not overly familiar with Terry Gilliam's work, but this film knocked my socks off. Rarely have I seen such imagination and creativity behind the camera as I saw here. The story is in truth 1984 with a few different twists (Gilliam himself called it 1984 and a 1/2), but while its structure runs Orwell close, there's much much more for cinephiles to savour. Jonathon Price manages to look vacant but intelligent as the worm that turns against the forces of establishment, along the way pursuing, his literally dream-girl along the way. Michael Palin is surprisingly effective as his erstwhile chum who later betrays him while Peter Jones also makes an impact as the eccentric despot Mr Helpmann who can only talk it seems in sporting clichés and Katherine Helmond shines as Price's appearance obsessed mother. I was less taken with Jane Greist as Jill (read Julia) and can see Gilliam trying to keep the camera away from her and for he life of me can't understand Bob Hoskins, far less Robert DeNiro, turning up from time to time. The film lashes out in many directions with palpable hits on faceless bureaucracy, plastic surgery and the suppression of dissent with some scary, can't-happen-here possible portents of the future, none more so than the blackly humorous concept of citizens being billed for the State torturing confessions out of them. More than anything though, it's the restless invention of director which carries the viewer along. The sets are magnificent, convincingly unworldly yet recognisably of the present- day. The feeling of oppression is everywhere in the grey monolithic constructs that the zombie-like un-civil servants inhabit, but there's dark humour too in the form of the slyly inserted spoken vulgarities and the gradual deterioration in the appearance of his mother's friends ever-different face. The narrative is interspersed with a mock-heroic Price taking on the State in the form of a massive Samurai warrior in vivid dream sequences while striving to reach his vision of Greist who he hopes will be his salvation. There's a suitably bleak but enigmatic ending too, bringing to a finish a film that had me gawping and scratching my head by turns. I'm all for directors, indeed artists taking chances with their art and that's unquestionably what drives Gilliam here. It mostly pays off and proved a feast for my mind and eyes.",Brazil
28,ElMaruecan82,When the director's style steals the story's thunder...,7,13 December 2016,"""Brazil"" has the title, the music and the creativity upon which masterpieces are made on, but it's like an irrepressible and suffocating twirling mass of the same paperwork that poison people's lives have taken over the plot, and it's only within its core that you can understand why this is such a great movie. But a better editing would have befitted such an ambitious plot, a pity Gilliam; the artist triumphed over the director. This is an artsy film with no direction.The last Gilliam film I watched was ""The Fisher King"" and it suffered the same syndrome. I enjoyed it but the story was never as brilliant and soul-penetrating as in the quieter and more realistic parts. It could have done without the Red Dragon hallucinations and even that Holy Grail subplot. But what Gilliams' movies say about him is that he has a sort of childlike obsession with ""conflict"" as something that can only be exposed through some big-scale extravaganza fights with high-tech effects and so forth, and that's exactly what almost ruined my enjoyment of ""Brazil"". The film is like a big party you're invited to, you enjoy yourself, you have fun, but because of two or three incidents, you're not sure you want to live the same experience again. Now, there's no doubt that the film is brilliant and it's a great satire against the overwhelming effect of bureaucracy and even technology (although it is displayed in a retro-futuristic way), we are all literate enough to get all the Orwellian vibes from the film, and even now, I can't imagine the hell of bureaucracy without that Brazilian tempo working in my mind. So, no one who criticized ""Brazil"" missed the point. But it's like Gilliam wants so much to emphasize the feeling of sheer confusion induced by the whole (mis)adventure that instead of making the story confusing by maintaining a solid plinth to the narrative, he made the experience of following the film, confusing as well. At one moment, you see Sam trying to find a woman, which in the actual setting is Herculean enough a task, and another moment, he's a warrior fighting a giant Samurai. I love some artistic licenses, but talk about overkill. Gilliam had a good story at hands but he goes for sensationalism while he had enough material to design something thrilling in the content, without going for such hyperbolic action sequences. The result is uneven and infuriating. When you trust your material, you don't need some pseudo psychedelic fights, chase sequences or other wall-crashing moments, action isn't always to be treated literally. Yes, this is a world that takes some monster Godzilla-like size, but I don't care that Gilliam wanted to pay homage to Kurosawa with the Samurai-figure, just make a tribute to ""Ikiru"" which was a real movie about bureaucracy, and it'll be fine. The same goes with the Brazilian escapist moments, first it's poetic and dreamlike, but they are so redundant that you don't know which story you're supposed to follow in the end. It says a lot about Gilliam and his tendency to make polarizing movies when they're no need for it. Indeed, we need a story, you can't make the cleverest satire without trying to confuse the audience but, it's like some suicidal impulse that is somewhat more fascinating than the film's content. I tried to watch ""Brazil"" twice, the first time, I fell asleep, the second, I turned it off because I was tired of trying to figure out what point he wanted to make with this or that scene. Now. I finally made it till the end, and while I acknowledge that there was some potential in this film and some scenes are nothing short but masterpieces: the Metropolis-like shots, any scene with Katharine Helmond and Ian Holm, and some brilliant little touches like the duct on the dog's poo-hole, this is still one of the cases where the final cut should've been shorter. The element that is constantly praised by the fans is the critics against bureaucracy, well, that makes the whole fights and chases quite useless, and what about the heart of the story: Sam? Sam Lowry, played by Jonathan Pryce, was a great character, the perfect straight man to this tragicomedy. Why not making him someone who really wants to go to Brazil? Why not creating some deeper connection with the woman, not just ""curiosity""? How about the Harry Tuttle guy? The film had plenty of directions to take, but it just makes his main protagonist wander in a dystopian universe, encountering the most eccentric characters, and punctuate the film with a few actions sequences and weird nightmarish intrusions.I love the way Siskel described the movie: ""It beautifully beats to death one point"" He nails it. This is the film the expressions ""insisting upon itself"" was invented for, and even the whole bureaucracy thing is a bit overrated. I don't know if this review will be useful for anyone, but if I want a great and short satire about bureaucracy, I watch ""The Place That Sends You Mad"" segment from ""The Twelve Tasks of Asterix"". Now, that's perhaps the best critic against bureaucracy ever made, and it didn't need any special effects or fight sequences.As for ""Brazil"", Gilliam is one hell of a director and writer, but you know, there's a reason why they also give Oscars for ""editing"". As I said for another Gilliam's film, it's like the directing's style stealing the story's thunder.",Brazil
29,paul2001sw-1,The price of freedom...,8,11 October 2006,"Most of the films directed by ex-Monty Python cartoonist Terry Gilliam have been visually overloaded, incoherent financial disasters. But 'Brazil', one of his earliest features, was a fine film. Set ""somewhere in the twentieth century"" the aesthetic of its universe is, in defiance of its title, very much 1940s Britain, albeit supplemented by a range of Heath-Robinson style gadgetry: this retro-future look seems to have been utilised by many other films since, although few share the exaggerated exuberance of Gilliam's vision. And while the movie's concerns are those of most stories about totalitarianism, some of them seem particularly relevant today: the growth of the state bureaucracy in response to perceived terrorist threat, the debasement of the English language, the growth of plastic surgery and the difficulty of getting a plumber (Bob Hoskins plays one of these, some years before 'Super Mario Bros.'!). It's also arguably the most successful of all films made by any of the Pythons (including those made by all of them together) in incorporating their trademark zany humour within a coherent plot. 'Brazil' is not flawless: in places, it appears amateurish (although in other places, this effect is probably deliberate) and it's a little too long, as Gilliam indulges himself in a lengthy final sequence. But compared so such near-unwatchable messes as his later film 'Twelve Monkeys', it stands up very well, and left this viewer wondering why his subsequent movies have been so little to my taste.",Brazil
30,bowmanblue,Python's take on 1984,8,14 July 2014,"If you don't know, the slightly weirdly-titled 'Brazil' is a science fiction film, directed by one of the Monty Python team. It's also about a dystopian future, not to dissimilar to that George Orwell showed us in his book, 1984. Therefore, if you're familiar with either or both Gilliam and 1984, you should have a shrewd idea about how they would mix.Brazil isn't as light (or madcap) as other Python films; it's more dark, disturbing and surreal. If you've seen Gilliam's other cult masterpiece 'Time Bandits,' it has a similar feel to it.Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowry, your typical 'everyman' who gets caught up in the borderline fascist world of the future which we see depicted in Brazil. It's not your average hero, he's weedy, scared, yet relatable as he dreams of being something more than just another guy who processes paperwork all day. When he's not shoving receipts into pods and sending them on their way, he's fantasising about being a winged angle-type creature who can fly through the sky and escape the world he lives in.Brazil is part sci-fi, a little bit (Python) comedy and a lot social satire on what life may be like if society follows its current path of needless paperwork and pointless form-filling.If you're a fan of Gilliam's other work (mainly Time Bandits), social satire, sci-fi, or the offshoots of Python in general, you should enjoy Brazil. However, it's not entirely without fault. The leading lady is a little bit bland and has no cinematic presence whatsoever. However, she doesn't really come into until the second half, so she doesn't detract from the film too much. Plus it does seem to drag in places. Brazil is probably one of those rare epic films that might actually benefit from having its runtime reduced, meaning some of the scenes end up a little shorter. But, if worse comes to the worst, you can always skip those bits and simply enjoy seeing Robert DeNiro as a 'renegade heating engineer' – only in Python!",Brazil
31,dromasca,1984 + 1,9,20 November 2012,"I got very late to seeing Brazil. 27 years later. It was released in 1985, one year after Orwell's year, which was also the exact moment I left my own Orwellian universe, the one where I had lived the first 31 years of my life. I was too busy finding my ways in the new world to see good movies then, I had no time and no money, the getting back to the pleasure of seeing movies happened only a few years later. This is how I missed this exuberant anti-utopia, an almost permanent mix of dreams and nightmares, where reality is the longest and darkest nightmare of all. Now I eventually found the time and the opportunity to do it, from the perspective and with the experience of an individual who spend an almost equal period of time in a supposedly free society. I was impressed. The story of the clerk in the Kafkaesque bureaucratic system is basically similar to the one in 1984. What is different here is the freedom that director Terry Gilliam took in building his retro-futuristic world, the infinite imagination in building the sets in all their complexity and attention to details. There are many memorable scenes in this film, some impress by the visuals, other by the rhythm of the action, the surprising actions. the relation between the characters that borrows a lot from the classical films of Chaplin, Keaton, Laurel and Hardy in a Metropolis atmosphere. Almost each scene is a masterpiece of sets creation and architecture.Jonathan Pryce made here probably the best role of his career, while Bob Hoskins and Robert De Niro (not necessarily in the best role of his life) leave their marks as well. Almost three decades later the future imagined in movies like 1984 and Brazil is closer to our reality than ever. Mind control, interference of the authorities in private lives, permanent supervision, and huge electronic bureaucracies at work in any aspect of life are all realities. Some of the machines that we are using may be more sophisticated or just different than the ones imagined by the directors of those movies, but in many other aspects we are almost there.",Brazil

33,Bored_Dragon,Care for a little necrophilia?,10,11 September 2018,"This surreal satire was inspired by George Orwell's ""1984"" and it's second in Terry Gilliam's ""Trilogy of Imagination"", first being ""Time Bandits"" from 1981 and third ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" from 1988. Placed in a retro-futuristic dystopian world, which is completely drowned in bureaucracy, it shows everyone as just a cogwheel in this absurd machine. Movie is full of more or less obvious details that show us the reality we live in, in caricatured and exaggerated way, but essentially it's a warning what modern society is degrading to become - one huge more and more complicated machine that seemingly tends to perfection, but the more complex it becomes the more it loses its purpose, while essentially destroys humanity in every possible way.Our main character is a clerk who seems to be satisfied with living an indistinctive life of small cogwheel, but in his dreams, he is flying through clouds, where he meets the lovely woman. Subconsciously, the man trapped by the system dreams of freedom and love. When a simple typo in paperwork causes an innocent man to die, he attempts to correct this mistake and doing so he meets the woman from his dreams in real life. Now he digs deeper and deeper into government machine, trying to find out about her, and the line between his dreams and reality fades.The cast is phenomenal. The leading role is entrusted to Jonathan Pryce, and to support him there are Robert De Niro, in small but striking role, Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins), Bob Hoskins (Super Mario), Michael Palin (Monty Python), Peter Vaughan (Maester Aemon from GoT), Jim Broadbent (he has too many great roles for me to chose from, but let's say Harold Zidler from Moulin Rouge), and many more. You'll find some beautiful camera work here. Dream sequences are breathtaking. Visually impressive, but gloomy and disturbing. The movie has a grace of film noir. It's drama, but with a certain sense for black humor. Watching this madness of symbolism and metaphors was one quite strange experience which is hard to describe. You should see, or better say, feel it for yourself. Strong recommendation.10/10",Brazil

The film is visually opulent and has a nice score, but it really has no point except that Big Brother type government is bad - who knew? However, Gilliam takes forever to not make his point. Pryce is pretty good as the protagonist and Greist is cute as his love interest. It's not clear what De Niro is doing in this movie, but then again there are many things that are not clear in this movie. It is mildly amusing at times but far outstays its welcome.

35,The-Sarkologist,A brilliant take on Orwell's 1984,10,28 October 2011,"The first thing that attracted me to this movie was the screenshot on Microsoft's Cinemania. The screen shot resembled something from City of Lost Children. Then I learnt that it was directed by Terry Gilliam (Monty Python, 12 Monkeys) and this intrigued me even more. Now that I have seen it I can say that it is a very strange movie with many elements of Monty Python in it, and it is a very intelligent and well made movie. I am finding that Terry Gilliam is a very good director. I might also mention that Tom Stoppard (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead) also worked on the screenplay.Brazil is about a man named Sam Lowery. He is a quiet man who enjoys his average job. He as no ambitions or goals, though he dreams that he is a winged knight fighting huge monsters to save a beautiful damsel. This dream is very important and the monsters and the damsel are significant to the movie.The world is the late 20th Century and has become a totalitarian, highly bureaucratic world. All we know is that the Ministry of Information controls this world, and the Bureau of Information Retrieval is the most powerful organisation in this ministry. This is all we know about the government, and we need not know anymore. The people are oppressed, though don't seem to realise it. Along with this, a terrorist organisation is setting off bombs, and has been doing so for the last 16 years.Sam's mother is a dignatory in this bureaucracy and is trying to push Sam forward by using her contacts. Sam does not want to go though, but this changes one day when a terrorist know as Mr Tuttle is requested to give Information Retrieval some information. Unfortunately, a bug is splattered on the page and the name Tuttle become Buttle. As such the wrong person is arrested, and Information Retrieval, the most efficient organisation, does not want word of this to get out. Sam discovers this injustice and decides to intervene to help restitute Buttle's family, and sees the girl in his dreams. When he learns that she is wanted, he takes the job in Information Retrieval to save her.This is where the idea of the beast and the damsel come in. At one stage in the movie, the girl whom Sam is chasing, dresses up as the girl in his dreams. This is not something that Sam tells her, but what she does for him. The beast is in fact the bureaucracy that is suffocating the society, and Sam manages to defeat it, temporarily. The one thing about this movie is that it is about shattered dreams. It seems that he has succeeded but everything comes crashing in when the efficient Information Retrieval arrive in his room, arrest him and kill her.Nothing is as it really seems in this movie because we are looking through Sam's hopes and dreams, and we will see him succeed only to discover that they have been shattered. The hopes of the people are keep in tow by the illusion that Information Retrieval are competent and work for them. The guards are dressed as WWII Nazi soldiers, which reveals to us the truth behind it all. The city is dark and polluted, and even when they are in the country there are only bleak hills and sign boards displaying a possibility of a real life. The only time the country is seen is in a deep dream of Sam's, and this is a dream that he is not going escape from. Friends are not friends really, and this is encapsulated in one statement: you know we are close, so until this thing blows over, stay away from me. Sam, who believes that the girl is a terrorist, brings the anger of the establishment onto him, only to learn that she was a simple truck driver, her only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This is revealed when she sees Tuttle and asks, ""who is he?"". Even Tuttle, whom Sam believes to be a terrorist, is simply a rogue engineer who hounds and frustrates two other engineers.Brazil is an incredible and intelligent movie. There is so much in it, that it cannot all simply be brought out in one viewing. There are lots of allusions between the different aspects of the movie, as well as subtle uses of the camera and strange scenes which give you a perception of one thing only to undermine it seconds later. This is a movie that has deep meanings and a lot of provocation. Is it the state of things to come?",Brazil
36,briancham1994,Dark fantasy,6,11 August 2020,This film is like a surreal fantasy come to life through the lens of science fiction. The style is quite off kilter to really portray the total unease of the dystopian setting. For the most part this satire works at poking fun of oppressive bureaucracies but at a lot of times this style was too distracting from the main point.,Brazil
37,didi-5,Gilliam's masterpiece,7,9 July 2003,"Terry Gilliam's best movie, in my opinion, is a warped 1984, with Sam Lowry as a futuristic librarian trapped in the bureaucratic system.  As Lowry, Jonathan Pryce has a brilliant chance to shine in the lead, which he does. In support, he has Kim Griest, Katherine Helmond, Ian Holm, Robert de Niro, and Bob Hoskins, amongst others.  Brazil is surprisingly violent - viewing it again recently after a gap of several years, I found the constant attacks, bombings etc., slightly sickening, although I'm sure that is the intention.  Gilliam's films, like his Python cartoons, thrive on the grotesque, and Brazil is no exception. Lowry is a misfit, a square peg in a round hole, and like Winston Smith in Orwell's apocalypse, there is no place for him in his world.  The bleak ending emphasises this very point, and leaves the viewer curiously empty.",Brazil
38,Dr_Coulardeau,A fertile cross between Bible and science fiction,10,5 February 2007,"Terry Gilliam is a raider, a looter, a thief, a borrower by definition. So here like in most his other films he borrows, with the intention of not giving anything back, something from about everyone. He borrows from the Bible and an Archangel Michael killing some dragon. He borrows from the Chinese and one of their bad spirits living in some mountain and spitting fire. He borrows from 1984, I was going to say of course, and of course it is evidently of course. He borrows from Fritz Lang and his Metropolis. The list would be long and probably never ending. And I have not touched the words that seem to be a long series of quotations interspersed here and there with some original phrases though all the words are of course borrowed from some dictionary, but this latter defect is a common disease. Terry Gilliam is settling some accounts with everyone you can imagine. First with his mother who is only concerned by her skin and looking younger than she is, but also by the future of her son and this enables her to pull some strings and she loves that, and of course with the desire to marry her own son with the daughter of her best friend who shares the same desire to look younger everyday and ends up as a pack of rotting and rotten bones in a casket, in a coffin, in a death box. Then he settles so many accounts with bureaucracy and administrative or police hassling that I would not have enough of three days and fifty five pages just to enumerate the evils he exposes here, and yet without giving any details. But he also settles some accounts with his own vision of the world, but this time without maybe knowing it. All structures in the shape of corridors crossing or not, tunnels, byways, bridges but all designed from straight lines are doomed to fail leading anywhere, are mazes and labyrinths. Salvation, and Terry Gilliam believes in comedy hence in happy endings, can only come from the very melting-pot of suffering and torturing, from the big womb opening up onto the sky, but also to the saviours that are air-lifted into this womb of evil to rescue their friend. But this salvation will have to go through a small door at the bottom of this womb, nearly at the back of it, and then through some labyrinth to come back out into the sunshine through a double gaping door. But this would not be finished if I did not mention the major culprit he is settling accounts with, the city, the metropolis, the city and suburban sprawl-drawl-crawl, the fire of the factories and the gold of the rich, that urbanized humanity that necessarily hosts and nurtures rebellion, subversion, urban guerrilla warfare and so many clandestine, moon-shining, black market, unofficial and underground activities, commercial, industrial or political as you like it. That's Brazil. It is serious and yet it is funny, though the after-dinner mint is missing and big brother has nothing of a big brother at all. In a way, it is true, some scene make me think of some industrial district in London or Berlin or Leipzig thirty years ago, the East End before the rehabilitation of the Docks for example.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Brazil

But that's my life in Paris, especially since 2015: like Sam, i'm a push-paper in an office; Paris is really like this dark city, with tiny flats, pollution, incredibly poor suburbs and no sun! France is the paradise of paper administration: we have regulation for everything and largely for nothing and since a few horror attacks, we live in emergency state to allow government protect us against an handful but terrible terrorists!

40,howard.schumann,"A brilliant, surreal, and important film",9,10 April 2006,"Some twenty-one years have passed since Terry Gilliam's boldly satirical Brazil was first released yet it is still as audacious, inventive, and thought provoking as ever. Although its dazzling images do not always add up to a coherent narrative, there is much in the film that clearly addresses problems we are struggling with today: an out of control bureaucracy, state security versus individual liberty, and technology versus privacy. There is enough ambiguity in the film, however, to leave it open to a wide variety of interpretations, including Gilliam's own as simply representing the dreams and insecurities of middle age. Regardless of whether its message is Orwellian or not, however, Brazil is a continuously entertaining film that will keep you fully engaged. The title of the film refers not to the nation in South America but to a romantic ballad from the forties. Its setting is somewhere and its time is ""sometime in the twentieth century"".Jonathan Pryce is Sam Lowry, a cautious low-level clerk in The Ministry of Information who has always resisted being promoted, even though his mother (Katherine Helmond) is adept at pulling strings for him. In this brave new world depicted by a maze of ducts, corridors, statues, gigantic buildings, and signs telling you how to think, Lowry prefers his day-to-day routine. His only escape from boredom is through flying dreams in which he is clad in a knight's armor, ready to rescue his lover from the forces of darkness. When a bungled arrest leads to the death of the wrong man, Sam delivers the ""refund"" check to the deceased man's wife and discovers that the girl of his dreams Jill Layton (Kim Griest) lives upstairs. He learns that she is wanted by Information Retrieval as a terrorist and decides to accept the promotion so he can protect her. Before they can run off to live happily ever after, however, the government has something to say about it. Sam is arrested for sabotage and faces the torture chamber with his best friend, Jack Lint (Michael Palin) as the torturer.Brazil contains many comic sequences that stay with you: the hilarious tug of war to share a desk that extends between two different offices, the follies of plastic surgery to preserve the youth of Sam's mother's and her best friend, Mrs. Alma Terrain (Barbara Hicks), the over-the-top singing messenger who invites Lowry to a party at his mother's house, and the antics of Archibald ""Harry"" Tuttle (Robert de Niro), a Central Services repair man turned terrorist. The film, however, adds up to more than a collection of absurd situations. It is a prescient work that anticipates how a war on terrorism can be used as a justification to attack individual rights, and how technology run amok can lead to dehumanization. A brilliant, surreal, and important film, Brazil describes a government that is out to save society by destroying it and a man who knows that his only escape from an oppressive rationality lies in his imagination.",Brazil
41,Tweetienator,Not That Funny,6,11 March 2021,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is a nice trippy and imaginative piece with lots of fun ideas, subtle and sometimes not so subtle satire on society: absurd and grotesque slapstick moments and motifs, ideas that remind of Kafka's Process or Orwell's 1984, but transformed to comedy. Yes, Brazil is sometimes a fine ride, but what I miss strongly is some more serious or dark tones added to Brazil: in the end Brazil is more or less a slapstick sci-fi comedy but compared to the great masterpiece The Life of Brian, there are far less really funny moments to find in Brazil, and on top, I gotta confess, some scenes really bored me, and whereas my tummy hurt after watching The Life of Brian, the impact of Brazil was a far weaker one. Verdict: Brazil is good but in my opinion no masterpiece and Twelve Monkey easy the stronger one of both journeys of Mr. Gilliam into the domain of sci-fi.",Brazil

Sure, the art director is excellent. As are most of the performances, especially Jonathan Price. Price is terrific. It's just as a whole, ""Brazil"" is too long and too cluttered to be enjoyable.

44,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Bizarre in its methods but brilliant in its concepts,8,8 August 2009,"How does one put a Monty Python twist on a dystopian/Orwellian (whichever term you prefer) science-fiction fantasy? The answer might not be clear, but as long as Terry Gilliam knows it, it can be done. The ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" director begins his career of daring reality-bending films with ""Brazil,"" maybe his greatest or if not most signature film.Named after the iconic song, ""Brazil"" is a quirky-spirited and outlandish futuristic film that operates subtly and with peculiarity as only Gilliam would have it. Unlike the more popular dystopian films of today, you can't rely on theme-heavy dialogue to understand Gilliam's warning to society, you have to sit and absorb the bizarre imagery, seemingly irrelevant dream sequences and comic downplay of dramatic events. Once you understand why it's there and stop worrying about exactly what it means, the genius becomes clearer.The film stars Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry, an unambitious bureaucrat who works for the Ministry of Information in a very mechanical society with an extensive yet inefficient process for bringing criminals, namely terrorists, to justice. Therefore, a small printing error leads to the unlawful arrest and death of Archibald Buttle, not Archibald 'T'uttle. Lowry must investigate the error and in the process comes across a woman (Kim Greist) whom he recognizes from his dreams where he's soaring in the air with wings toward a beautiful woman in white robes. He decides to pursue this woman and it leads him down a dangerous path.Gilliam introduces us to this society by showing its excessive yet seemingly unreliable technology. Sam's air conditioning breaks down, gourmet food is needlessly ground into globs and everything has a large and obtrusive cord attached to it. All this seems strange because its on the periphery of what's happening to Sam, so it can easily be dismissed as excessive detail. On the contrary, it's what quietly makes this Gilliam's masterpiece.The more human story is in Sam's pursuit of this dream in reality, a dangerous feat. Claiming early in the film that he wants nothing for himself, this woman is the only exception. He pursues it relentlessly and it costs him. As completely absurd as some of the events occurring to him appear to be, these trippy sequences ultimately test his character despite their strange tactics.Icing all this is the quirky Monty Python style. It's not the humor that lends itself to the film, but sort of the spirit of Monty Python. Even Michael Palin plays a small role to sort of perpetuate this feeling. Since everything goes mostly unexplained, this humor compounds the oddities of the film, poking fun at the excessiveness whether it be Sam's mother's face lifts and same surgeries that slowly kill her friend or playing up the dialogue between Sam and other characters such as Tuttle (De Niro) in the midst of an abnormal scenario.""Brazil"" might not be a science-fiction film for everyone, but it deserves classic status for lovers of the genre. It's just very untypical in its delivery, going for a hallucinogenic and more discomforting style of film-making that Terry Gilliam has made a name for himself on. It won't appease the average viewer who demands more direct service between him/herself and the creative mind behind the film, but it will offer a lot to ponder to those who like partaking in that when the credits role.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Brazil

46,funkyfry,One of my favorite films of all time,10,11 January 2007,"This film is a treasure to me, so I'm really not sure how objectively I can talk about it. I also don't know if there's anything to be said that hasn't already been said before. But whatever, I will just comment on some of the things that strike me particularly about the film.First of all, it seems to me that at least cinematically dealing with a dystopia in a satirical or comedic way is far superior to doing so in a more straightforward manner. This film is far more interesting than ""1984"" or any of the other films that have tried to capture a serious pessimistic view of future society.I've always felt like the song ""Brazil"" fit into the film very well -- it suggests a kind of ridiculous Utopian or exotic romanticism, blown completely out of scale. There are several scenes in the film that visually portray this concept, such as the shot of the futuristic street which turns out to be only a tiny model which an old drunk with a Guinness is glaring at. Sam Lowry himself is a very dull person to begin with, as Jill Layton's reaction to him indicates. He believes, at least in his conscious mind, that he doesn't want any conflict or excitement in his life. ""Not even dreams"" he says -- but of course the truth we see is quite different, and it eventually unhinges his life and his mind. I think I'm not alone in sympathizing with this. Our lives can get so monotonous and so dreary, but we do convince ourselves that we're happy. ""It's what you wanted, isn't it?"" says Mr. Kurtzmann.Some of my favorite bits -- when Mr. Kurtzmann hits his hand on the table (""what a pathetic creature I am!""), Harry Tuttle's first appearance and his escape on the wire, the dinner scene where you have the explosion and then the waiters are setting up screens to block the diners' view of the bloody mayhem.Basically I think in this film what you have is a scary story about how dangerous it is in the modern world to be a dreamer. But rather than simply terrify us, Gilliam is giving us a chance to laugh at the existential absurdity of it all.",Brazil
47,jzappa,"Whether You're Indifferent Or Not, The Director Certainly Isn't",8,9 May 2007,"Brazil's story is another Orwellian opus, but told with a much different imagination. The focus is not necessarily on the dictatorial potential of society but the bureaucratic. Paperwork is the nightmare for the characters, not necessarily opinions, government secrets, etc. The movie trudges and stumbles through several different characters whose screen time will have absolutely no rhythm, as we can see none of them for forty minutes yet they can still be very pivotal characters, its symbolisms may have a vague effect when really the only reason they aren't clear is because of the sheer scope of them. Brazil mainly focuses on themes of dreamers vs. reality, the antagonism of bureaucracy, and the film's point is mysterious. It's a hard film to understand.The fantasy sequences, wherein Jonathan Pryce, the main character, dreams that he has wings and is flying over sun-chinked clouds and seeking the woman of his dreams, who of course turns out to be a character in reality, trouble me whenever they come. There is something uneven about them.Robert De Niro's role in the film is very entertaining, not simply because of his purpose but because of his portrayal by De Niro. I know whenever I see him in a movie, I think of him in terms of his staple roles and genres, and so whenever I see him in a movie that departs completely from the movies that bear those, I'm very interested in his performance. This could possibly be one of his most interesting. He is goofy here.Terry Gilliam is a great director because whether all of his movies are great or not, they still have great depth, ardor, and idealism. Brazil is a milestone of such characteristics.",Brazil
48,Vartiainen,"Amusing, dark and thoughtful",8,11 November 2012,"What do you get when you combine Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, Monty Python and the bizarre imagery of a mad genius. Well, this movie. Brazil is a film more about style and the feel of things rather than plot and reason. Things will happen in this film without any reason other than that they fit the general atmosphere. Quite often the camera will swift to something completely standalone and abstract, or something will happen at the background that will utterly steal your focus and leave you scrambling to discover just what was said while you were staring at the small dog being stolen by the maitre d'. And the film is absolutely brilliant because of this.It would be neglecting to say, however, that there isn't a story here waiting to be told. There are themes being addressed, most opinionatedly the idea that men are sheep and that if all we ever are is sheep then it is possible that our leaders won't be anything but sheep either. And thus the world of Brazil could be born. A world of dystopia, but one that hasn't been born out of dictatorship or malignancy, but rather out of sheer incompetence. Only two characters in this world are in any way competent. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), the main character himself, though he is crippled by his shyness and unwillingness to make a difference, so it's a bit of a stretch to call him competent, and Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), who's a resistance 'fighter' and quite possibly fictional. And thus our world is set and we are let loose to examine it, laughing and pointing as we go.It's important to remember that while Brazil is a great political and social satire, it's still an excellent comedy above all else. Its humour is dark and sometimes ill-spirited, but I watched this film with a smile on my face. The humour is often rather subtle and I'd surmise that it would require a second or even third viewing for me to get all the jokes, but that's because there are so many of them there to be found. Hidden in the background, sneaked into the dialogue, in the tones of voices.Is the film for everyone? Certainly not, as its sense of humour is not for everyone and one needs to have an appreciation for satire for them to get what the film is trying to achieve. A certain affinity for art films is also recommended, as the film is more about style than logic, as stated. The dream sequences and the ending especially require the viewer to let go and go with the flow. That said, if one has all this, then it's an amazing film of intricacy, wonder and amusement.",Brazil

50,ackstasis,"""Confess quickly! If you hold out too long you could jeopardise your credit rating.""",9,17 June 2007,"Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' is one heck of a film. A weird, twisted, fantastical tale of the sheer absurdity of an Orwellian society, the films draws inspiration from a lengthy series of science-fiction and dystopian novels and films  including Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis (1927),' Ray Bradbury's 'Fahrenheit 451 {or François Truffaut's 1966 adaptation},' Franz Kafka's 'The Trial {or Orson Welles' 1962 adaptation},' Anthony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' {or Kubrick's 1971 adaptation} and, more than anything else, George Orwell's 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' {adapted just one year earlier by Michael Radford}. Masterfully blending the horror of this misguided totalitarian government with Gilliam's gloriously absurd brand of Monty Python-esquire humour, 'Brazil' depicts the absolute folly of the direction in which our society is heading.Whilst 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' showed us a frighteningly effective police state in which ""evil-doers"" are brought to swift and inharmonious justice, 'Brazil's' equally formidable Ministry of Information doesn't even work properly. At the very beginning of the film, when the carcass of a swatted insect falls into a typewriter, the machine mistakenly issues an arrest warrant for a Mr. BUTTLE, rather than the suspected terrorist Mr. TUTTLE. The result of this minor bureaucratic foul-up will be the death-by-torture of the completely innocent Mr. Buttle, the degradation of his unfortunate family and the precipitation of the events of the film, featuring mild-mannered, unambitious, dream-obsessed urban worker Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce).We first meet Sam Lowry in his own dreams, as a silver-winged, bird-like mythical creature, soaring through the open air, free from the constraints of the fascist government that would later destroy his life. He seeks out his dream girl (Kim Greist), who calls his name softly from beneath a thin, floating veil. This is the first of several mythic dream sequences, full of idealistic notions of love, happiness and freedom, though the restrictive power of the Ministry of Information's totalitarian regime threatens on more than one occasion to rob him Sam of the only moments of happiness he can experience, within his own mind. In one compelling later dream sequence, Sam must battle to rescue his beloved dream-girl from an immense, monolithic like samurai-machine, which might be interpreted to represent the all-powerful technology of the Ministry of Information. When he discovers his own face behind the monster's mask, it is symbolic of Sam's own willingness to take part in such a regime.In his real life, Sam Lowry is a fairly dependable, but decidedly unmotivated, computer worker at the Department of Records. His jittery boss, Mr. M. Kurtzmann (Ian Holm), relies entirely on Sam to get him out of occasional ""tight spots,"" and fails to notice that his seemingly hard-working employees are switching their computer monitors to the day's classic movie screening as soon as his back is turned. Despite the pressure from his influential, plastic surgery-obsessed mother (Katherine Helmond), Sam has absolutely no desire to be promoted to the Ministry of Information until, that is, he spots his dream-girl in real life  named Jill Layton  and desires to learn as much about her as possible. Sam is shocked to learn that Jill is considered a potential terrorist, in league with the elusive heater-engineer terrorist Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), and so he sets out to protect her from a grisly fate.'Brazil' is a visually magnificent film, brimming with unparalleled production design (by Norman Garwood), set direction (John Beard, Keith Pain) and costume design (James Acheson). Roger Pratt's inventive cinematography beautifully captures a dark and menacing society that, at times, descends steeply into complete surrealism. The film's enigmatic title refers to Ary Barroso's catchy South American song, 'Aquarela do Brasil {Watercolour of Brazil},' which is a theme used frequently throughout the film, most noticeably during Sam's dream sequences. The opening lyrics of the song go as follows: ""Brazil / Where hearts were entertaining June / We stood beneath an amber moon / And softly murmured 'someday soon' / We kissed and clung together / Then, tomorrow was another day / The morning found me miles away / With still a million things to say."" Perhaps the film's title, 'Brazil,' refers to this eternal place of bliss and happiness, a seemingly unreachable place under the brutal dictatorship of society.While the film certainly borrows ideas from a varied assortment of previous works, 'Brazil' is simply unlike anything you have ever seen before. Simultaneously, it is a stern condemnation of fascism and a light-hearted, hilariously-absurd satire of government. The ending to the film is particularly powerful, with Gilliam offering us a typical happily-ever-after ending, and then yanking it away in the final seconds. After all, in such a dystopian society, a happy ending is not only unlikely, but it is damn near impossible. Curiously, Sam does eventually find his happiness, but it comes at the cost of his own sanity, and he starts to absentmindedly hum the title tune as his torturers depart and the credits begin to roll. Could this possibly be construed as a happy ending? It's definitely unlike any other that I've seen.",Brazil
51,dee.reid,"Gilliam's ""Brazil""",10,27 January 2007,"And that guy George Orwell thought the future looked rough! In ""Brazil,"" director Terry Gilliam gives some food for thought in a bureaucratic future society where a literal bug in the administrative system may send an innocent man to his death. ""Brazil"" is Gilliam's own personal take on bureaucracy, and Orwell's classic book ""1984"" (which had only been made into a movie the year before ""Brazil"" was released). The hero of this ""future"" (some sources cite that there's not a single futuristic bone in ""Brazil"" at all, and is instead a satirical view of our present state of bureaucracy) is Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce). When he discovers the error and tries to correct it, he himself becomes an enemy of the state. Inter-cut with his adventures, are his dreams, flying high above the clouds, his own problems, and rescuing his beloved Jill (Kim Greist) while battling a gargantuan samurai warrior (""the System""), and also receiving advice on domestic terrorism from Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro). ""Brazil"" is a visual marvel with some truly interesting sights and sounds, and some intelligent humor and script-writing. But it's also a very troubling picture to wrap your head around. Gilliam has some astounding ideas at work here, and it's very difficult to get some of it. But that just adds to the pleasure; it's an indication that we're watching something truly unique, something that is not seen very often in the film-making world.

52,mjneu59,Orwell on amphetamines,8,8 November 2010,"Terry Gilliam's stunning near-future fantasy is set ""somewhere in the 20th century"" (technology circa 1948, bureaucracy circa 1984), but his crazed vision of a society strangled by paperwork, police brutality, and mechanical heating ducts is actually a very warped mirror of any brave new world facing the next millennium. The film is a triumph of visual imagination, telling the story of one cog in a large and repressive machine whose complacency is shattered by, literally, a bug in the system, putting him on a collision course with saboteurs, suspected terrorists, a monolithic bureaucracy gone berserk, and the girl of his dreams. The dazzling production design completely overwhelms the characters and script, but with such a crowded, hyperactive visual scheme Gilliam obviously couldn't afford to waste any time worrying about plot details. As it is there's hardly any space on screen to exhibit the rich (if often dark) sense of humor, with jokes ranging from the sublime to the absurd to the truly grotesque.",Brazil
53,barnabyrudge,"Astonishing concept, always stimulating to watch, but ultimately bites off more than it can chew.",7,5 June 2005,"Terry Gilliam is in dark, subversive mood with this Orwellian fantasy. While the film has extraordinary futuristic sets, appropriately off-the-wall performances, and more ingenious ideas than you usually find in a dozen other movies put together, it still has its share of flaws. For one thing, there seems to be too much going on for the eye and ear to fully absorb. Not that I mind watching movies which demand the concentration of the viewer - in fact, I rather like films that are challenging and thought-provoking - but Brazil is extraordinarily hard to follow, even for those who give it the level of attention it demands. Perhaps it's one of those films best treated as an experience more than a narrative. Also, its extreme length is a drawback; as the film passes the two hour mark one begins to fidget a little with discomfort.In a futuristic state, bureaucracy has literally gone mad and people have lost their identity working in bleak, absurdly formalised offices where they spend practically the whole day carrying out monotonous paper-work. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) works in the Records Office, under the preposterously fussy eye of Mr Kurtzmann (Ian Holm). Lowry survives day after day of uninterrupted boredom by day-dreaming of himself as a winged super-hero protecting the world from various villains and monsters, and wooing a gorgeous blonde woman (Kim Greist). Due to a printing error, an arrest warrant is issued for a law-abiding citizen named Mr Buttle (the real warrant is intended for a heating-engineer-turned-terrorist named Tuttle, played with surprising comic flair by Robert De Niro). Buttle is duly arrested and tortured to death, but his neighbour Jill Leyton (Griest, again) is determined to clear the name of the wronged Mr Buttle, which she does by relentlessly pestering the various agencies involved in the mix-up. When Sam realises that the blonde beauty of his dreams actually exists, and that the authorities are out to silence her, he breaks away from his deskbound existence and tries to assume the heroic role he has so often dreamed of in a doomed effort to protect her.Brazil is a dazzling film on many levels, especially in its depiction of a frightening society where the hours spent sleeping and dreaming are infinitely more desirable than the depressing waking hours. Gilliam seems to be suggesting that his invented world is the culmination of every social ""mistake"" in history, from the McCarthy era witch-hunts to Stalinism. It is certainly one of the bleakest and most damning visions of the future ever put on film. Pryce carries the film excellently as the ever-questioning, ever-imaginative hero in a society where everyone else has forgotten how to question and imagine. Griest is terrific as the girl of his dreams (whose ""real"" self turns out to be tougher and more resourceful than he could dare believe); and De Niro's small role as the dashing saboteur is very amusingly played. Brazil is not for all tastes, and resolutely demands several re-viewings in order to take it all in, but it still stands as encouraging evidence that creativity and originality lurk in the shadows of post-'70s cinema. I give it a 7 from my personal viewpoint, but a 9.5 for its cult potential.",Brazil

55,drystyx,Futuristic Walter Mitty a stunning piece,8,5 March 2007,"Make no mistake, and disregard most other comments. This movie's plot is not what many assert. It is, in fact, a futuristic ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"" probably truer to the Danny Kaye movie than to the short story. This movie is about a man's fantasies, but unlike the short story, the fantasies mix more with truth and have a happier ending. That said, the film is of the cult classic genre. It has the theatre of the absurd, mixed in with characters who grow from stereotypes into more complex beings-two chief attributes of most cult classics. The visuals are stunning, and Robert De Niro shows just how good an actor he can be in his supporting role. This may be his best performance ever. He truly acts in this movie, and you won't recognize him, he is that good. The movie will stun you and exhilarate you.",Brazil

58,dworldeater,Insane,8,16 February 2019,"Brazil is Terry Gillam's brilliant and bizarre dystopian science fiction film. While, this is no doubt in the same vein as George Orwell's 1984, it is also a fantasy film, a satire and has lots of black comedy. The tone of the film is not so bleak, less heavy handed as in this ultra futuristic bureacratic society nothing works properly and there is mountains of paperwork and red tape for everything. This movie is taken from the point of view from a government worker's as he tries to correct a mistake made by the bueacracracy his life spirals out of control and he becomes enemy of the state. Terry Gillam presents this futuristic society as ultra conformist, sterile and completely inept and doomed to failure. As such this ultra uptight, consumer driven bureacratic vision is seen as a farce. Sam Lowry(Jonathon Price) has intense dreams of fighting the man and getting the girl. The lines of reality and sanity are blurred in this film and from a visual point of view is also very impressive. Brazil, as a film is a lot of different things and has a lot going on. Multiple viewings of this are recommended as there is a lot to take in at once, but is worth your time as it is a brilliant movie.",Brazil
59,Steffi_P,"""Then, tomorrow was just another day""",10,6 April 2007,"What is Brazil? Brazil is one of the most misunderstood masterpieces ever made.First of all Brazil is not a science fiction film. As the opening title says, it is ""Somewhere in the twentieth century"", but there are in fact no exact references to any particular time and place. Very little of the technology in its world is futuristic  it is just over the top. The setting of Brazil is not literally ""here and now"", but it is actually a satire on modern life  on the cold impersonal nature of bureaucracy, gadgetry, work and the state. All these things are sent up by exaggerating them and making them ridiculous  houses filled with gadgets, paperwork blocking the simplest of actions, office blocks that look like prisons and so on.Brazil is also not a surrealist film. It doesn't belong in the same category as pretentious modern nonsense like Being John Malkovic, for example. Once you get over the weirdness of the setting, it's actually quite a simple, logical story. More importantly it relates directly to a commonly shared experience  the experience of wanting to escape the daily grind.Like Gilliam's previous picture Time Bandits, Brazil is about the power of dreams and the imagination. It is about escapism. The counterpoint to the grim, grey world of daily life is Sam's dream world, where he is a dashing hero. As the pressure of reality begins to pile on Sam, his real life and his fantasy life become more and more intertwined. Things start to unravel when tries to recreate his dreams and become a hero in the real world. Finally, he retreats (perhaps permanently) into his fantasy world.One question many viewers will ask is ""Why Brazil?"" Brazil is an old Latin American-style big band hit, and virtually all of the music in the film is either a recording of it or at least loosely based on the tune. It may seem at odds with the overall tone with the film, but really it is perfect. It's a song about escaping to paradise, overshadowed by the knowledge that sooner or later you will have to leave  ""But return I will"" But it's not just the lyrics, the tune is also part of that atmosphere. The first scene in the department of records, about five minutes into the picture is the perfect example. First we hear the opening conga rhythm as we see the workers scurrying around  business, efficiency. Then we cut to the first of Sam's daydreams, and we hear the main melody  dreamy and wistful.There aren't many directors who could, on the one hand create something so rich, wild and wonderful and, at the same time perfectly capture the feeling of a human experience. While cinema is really all about escapism, perhaps the ultimate form of escapism, very few films have dealt directly with the subject. I think in the future Gilliam will be looked back on as one of the truly greatest directors of his era. If he's not now it's usually because he's considered a ""not-as-funny"" offshoot of Monty Python. But really film-making is where his strength lies.What is Brazil? Brazil is the beautiful dream you are woken from when the alarm goes off telling you it's time to get up and go to work.",Brazil
60,ShootingShark,Have You Got A 27B/6 ?,8,30 September 2007,"Sam Lowry enjoys working in a dreary government job in the Department of Records and spends his time fantasising of himself as an angelic hero. However, when he accidentally meets the girl of his dreams and becomes embroiled in terrorist subversion, he is forced to re-evaluate his morality, his position and how to do the right thing.Brazil is simply brilliant, on every level. It scores as a futuristic sci-fi adventure, a star-crossed love story, a nightmarish fantasy, a hilarious satire on consumerism and vacuous apathy, a dazzling piece of visual cinema and especially as a vicious attack on controlling manipulative governments and their insane bureaucracies. It owes more than a little to George Orwell's 1984, but whilst it has all the political power of that great book it's also packed full of wonderful humour, exciting action, loopy characters and dynamic scenes. I think it's my favourite British film of all time (even if the director is from Minneapolis). The imagery alone is simply incredible; a cold, imperious, granite world with no relief from the grey, covered in piping and steel, retro-future technology with tiny screens and nineteen-forties minimalist electrics, wall-to-wall propaganda posters and endless vistas. One of my favourite scenes is where Tuttle/DeNiro meets his sticky end - a man literally drowning in paperwork - an image which is absurd, horrifying, incredible and electrifying all at the same time. The whole movie is like that. The large cast are sensational, with Pryce particularly strong as the hapless, morally-stricken Sam, trying desperately to turn his life into something decent and keep his sanity. DeNiro is a wonder in a completely unfathomable small role who may in fact be only a fantasy in the hero's mind, Helmond and Hoskins are hilarious, Holm is beautifully paranoid and pathetic, and Palin is superb as the superficially pleasant but hideously nasty Jack Lint. The script, by Gilliam, noted playwright Tom Stoppard (Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead) and McKeown (who plays the slimy Lime) is nothing short of genius. The photography, by Roger Pratt, is even better; his amazing landscapes, wild colours and fast-moving shots leave you breathless and slack-jawed; the rapid pull-back on Sam's face in the torture-chamber near the end is simply one of the best shots ever filmed. There is also a wonderful, dreamy, hair-raising score by Michael Kamen which runs the gamut from symphonic hammerings to ear-chewing musak to thirties musical. No review of this outstanding movie would be complete without noting its criminal release in North America in a version first delayed then butchered then pulled by the artistically-challenged president of Universal Pictures; sadly this happens to a lot of good films (The Magnificent Ambersons, The Red Badge Of Courage, The Naked City, most of Sam Peckinpah's work, many others) but don't let it put you off. This movie is a powerful, mindbending, stupendous, one-of-a-kind adventure with a frighteningly comically accurate vision of the future which is growing dangerously closer all the time. The best film by a great mad director.",Brazil
61,truemythmedia,One of Gilliam's Best,10,24 June 2019,"""Brazil"" is a brilliant film. I personally would argue it's Gilliam's best, but he has so many other great films that I could understand any number of his films being toted as the director's magnum opus. Brazil is a hard film to describe, and while the surface-level story is easy to grasp, the elaborate intricacies of the symbolism and the depth of the world building, make it easy to come back to this film multiple times and catch something new every time.

62,davidmvining,Gilliam at his height,10,16 March 2020,"Here, Terry Gilliam found the best outlet for his rambling imagination in Brazil. All it took was including the daydreams of a dreamer in an outrageous future dystopia. This is really the perfect marriage of material and artist, combining the strengths of the artists with the needs of the narrative into a sprawling visionary package that works incredibly well.This is really an extension of the theme that Gilliam broached in Time Bandits. Instead of a small child yearning for escape from his small minded parents, we have a middle-aged man trapped in his little job in the middle of a massive bureaucracy that dominates a dystopia akin to 1984 but with more ducts. Sam Lowry finds the satisfaction in his life by having no real responsibilities and dreaming of flying over a green pastoral scene unseen in the hellish urban landscape he calls home. He hardly pays attention to the news, the people, or the explosions that go off around him. All that matters to him is his small little life.Things begin to go wrong for him when both reality and his fantasies begin to coalesce around him. His air conditioning unit in his apartment goes haywire, and he's saved by Harry Tuttle. Tuttle, you see, is wanted by the state for nefarious activities which include not following the rules on how to fix air conditioning units. He got tired of all the paperwork, so he went out on his own, fixing people's air conditioning problems under his own prevue. That's why they sent out the arrest orders at the start of the film that accidentally got changed to Buttle because of a bug in the system (literally) and led to the arrest of an innocent man. Two major things happen in response to these related events. The first is that Sam goes on a mission to work through the bureaucracy and deliver a check that overcharged Buttle for his interrogation to Buttle's wife. Nothing about it works out, of course. The other is that Central Services, the part of the bureaucracy that deals with air conditioning, shows up to Sam's apartment to fix the issue where they find that Tuttle has been at work. Having the power of the bureaucracy at their fingertips, they use arcane rules to make Sam's life a living hell, taking over his apartment completely.Through all of this is Jill, the real life manifestation of the woman in Sam's dreams. The woman in his dreams is ethereal with long hair, dressed in a flowing white robe, and flying through the air. Jill in reality has short hair, is kind of dirty with a mysterious bandage on one hand, dresses like a man, and has no interest in Sam. In the world that seems to be spinning out of control around him, Sam latches onto Jill, using his tools as a small cog in the bureaucracy to find her, even going so far as to take a promotion into the far more prestigious Information Retrieval department to get a higher security clearance to keep up his search.When Sam finally meets Jill, he simply won't let the difference between the reality before him and his dreams impede him. He insists on latching onto her as his escape from the awful reality of everyday life. It helps that she is part of the investigation that popped up around Buttle, not Tuttle. She witnessed Buttle's wrongful arrest and had started going around trying to get answers from the bureaucracy, and those kinds of questions aren't treated well by the state. Sam ends up protecting her and, by extension, helping her fall for him.Just recounting the events of the film doesn't really capture the intelligence and joyful execution. Jonathon Pryce is great as Sam, a man so completely unprepared for the fight that he gets himself into. The supporting cast around him including Ian Holm, Katherine Helmond, Robert de Niro, and Michael Palin. The visual design of everything is top-notch. It's part of the tradition that uses old technology in new ways to create something alien and futuristic. The fantasy sequences themselves are wonderfully designed as well. The final large section of the film that descends into surrealistic madness.The movie is ultimately about escape, much like Time Bandits, but it ends really differently. In the former movie, Kevin is thrust out into the greater world, having been trapped in a small place. In Brazil, the larger world is itself a prison, so the only place to really escape is inward, and that's exactly what Sam ends up doing. His dreams and fantasies become his reality, the kind of place where love can conquer all, but in the real world outside his induced madness, that sort of victory is impossible. It's a far more depressing view at the theme that Gilliam previously explored, but it's explored wonderfully well and leaves the audience with much to consider.I really do think that Brazil is Gilliam at his height. It's the greatest combination of his visual aesthetic and a script he ever worked on. It's well acted, well photographed, and done on a huge canvas that can capture the breadth of his imagination.",Brazil
63,Spleen,"Grim, yet dazzling",10,9 February 2001,"Is there a single science fiction from the 1980s, which uses computers in some way, and which doesn't look - at least while the computers are on screen - irredeemably dated?Yes, there is, and this is it.  It's because Gilliam doesn't have that fatal ""Wow, isn't this MODERN"" attitude.  The computers in ""Brazil"" have keyboards that need frequent oiling, and vacuum tube monitors too tiny to look at except through those plastic magnifying screens that people with failing eyesight use to read books.  Dated?  Not in the least.  No more than ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", a vision of the future with a title referring to a date that's now seventeen years in the past, is dated.None of the many similarities with Orwell's book detract from ""Brazil"". Many points of coincidence are simply due to the fact that both Orwell and Gilliam have an intelligent understanding of what's required to make dystopian fiction - and dystopian society - work.  There are more neat little ideas about the future in ""Brazil"" than in an other two or three science fiction films combined.  (This isn't due to length, either.)  And Gilliam presents his ideas with true visual flair.  Very close to the start, there's a superb long tracking shot through an impossibly chaotic and overworked office; Gilliam has clearly decided that no mere financial restrictions are going to prevent him from serving up lavish, jaw-dropping spectacle.  (The music in the office scene, and through most of the film, is an arrangement of the song ""Brazil"", which represents to at least one of the characters a vision of unattainable beauty - in case you were wondering what relevance the title could possibly bear to the story.)In addition to being spectacular, in a grey sort of way, ""Brazil"" is a true epic.  The hero undergoes a long journey, and so does the audience.  Perhaps Gilliam toys with us a little too much at the end - although if I'd been at a test screening I would have been very reluctant to say so.  I'd be frightened someone might listen to me and make changes.  And do I really think ""Brazil"" could have been improved upon?",Brazil
64,Amyth47,"An unfunny, unoriginal and boring mess",1,17 September 2018,"My Rating : 1/10Brazil is such a bad title for this film to be honest. If it was called something else it would have at least been more memorable.
It starts out fine but as it progresses it becomes more pointless and unnecessarily confusing and messy. There's so many themes which are stolen from various sources that it no longer retains any originality. Everything Brazil tries to do has been done much better in other movies such as A Clockwork Orange, The Trial and other Orwellian-themed sci-fi ventures. 
A very bad movie. Not recommended.",Brazil
65,onepotato2,Disasterpiece,2,31 July 2008,"When this movie became very overdue at theaters in 1985 (the studios fought releasing it in it's epic 131 minute length), Gilliam, with a head full of critics' raves, and feeling he had made Citizen Kane, took out an ad in Variety pestering ""Why have you not released my film?"" Well... the movie got released. It was a critical favorite (only). And I'm sure, 23 years later, Gilliam, still a very self-impressed man, STILL can't grant that Brazil (or really ANY of his movies) is too long.But finally, in the long run, the rhapsodizing critics have been shown to be wrong; Brazil hasn't grown in stature. And it's on it's way to being forgotten, because it makes it's tiny point looooooong before Gilliam thinks it does. For once the studio was RIGHT! The movie is content to noodle with comic eddies until they become exhausting. Whatever pride Gilliam takes in the small, dissolving cult that loves Brazil in its current form, the movie would have benefited immensely, in eyeshare alone, if he had tossed out 40 minutes. As his oeuvre confirms, Gilliam has no clue what ""Brevity is the soul of wit"" means. All that aside, Tim Burton and Gilliam are two directors who just can't fathom that production design alone cannot rescue a movie. Kim Griest doesn't have a comic molecule in her body. And one of the most amusing visuals here is stolen wholesale from Salvatore Dali; Katherine Hellmond's inverted high-heel-shoe/hat.That Gilliam ultimately helmed a movie that couldn't be finished (Quixote) is no surprise. I'm sure he takes it as a favorable comparison to Orson Welles, whose career he's consciously and constantly using as a template.",Brazil
66,framptonhollis,A Truly Great Film,10,20 January 2016,"Terry Gilliam once said that he never even considered his film ""Brazil"" a science fiction film, believe it or not. This was because it was a film that dealt with issues going on while it was being made, and some of the issues the film addresses are still relevant to some extent.This surreal satire takes place in a bleak, but highly possible, dystopian future. It is full of extremely dark comedy, beautiful, glorious production quality, and a surprisingly disturbing and unhappy ending (unless you watch the ""Love Conquers All"" version, which I don't recommend).It's a great film to look at, with epic sets and amazing to look at fantasy sequences that really enhance the viewing experience and makes the world that ""Brazil"" creates a more adventurous and thrilling environment.""Brazil"" is an amazing piece of filmmaking from a brilliant filmmaker.",Brazil
67,eric262003,A More Grim Overlook At The Future,8,13 July 2009,"""Brazil"" takes it rightful place in the annals as one of the most bizarre, surreal science-fiction comedy-dramas directed by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame. Not only was it it dangerously weird, it also observes at the future narrated with a cynical, grim outlook at what could happen many years from now (although it was released in 1985, it's still leaves you wondering 24 years later). To this day, this overlooked classic is still shot with mixed feelings as people who loved the movie may praise it was a work of genius while others will ostracize the movie for the lack of comprehension. Granted to those critics it does spring high on complexity, but it is without a doubt a definitive work of art in its photography and powerful message and at the same time it dissects a drab future that we could soon be facing. Set in the unglamorous future, ""Brazil"" follows the the path of an average guy named Sam Lowry (played by British actor Jonathan Pryce) who like the movie is appalled by the world around him. His nagging and self-centered mother (Katherine Helmond of ""Soap"" and ""Who's the Boss"" fame), howls at her son all the time into being above the rest, but he doesn't want to usurp anyone. Sam just wants to be like other guys and live a normal life. Sam works in an unexciting job as a file clerk, but things start to change his life when a Mr.Buttle(Brian Miller) gets his identity is mistaken for a terrorist confronting the government. Now it's up to Sam to put a stop to this madness, but in his path is a Harry Tuttle (Robert DeNiro)and another terrorist (Kim Griest) on the job to take down the government who seems to enter Sam's dreams at night. But after a while is becomes hard to decipher in this complicated but intriguing Sci-Fi cult-classic.In spite of the many great qualities, there are tons of flaws this movie contains. On the plus side, the acting is one of the strongest qualities with a great ensemble of talented performers and young up-and-comers at the time. The one who stands above them all is Jonathan Pryce as the drab, unhappy Sam Lowry. Pryce delivers Lowry with great depth of character that it was a downright dirty shame that he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award. It was also refreshing to see Robert DeNiro break out of typecasting as a humorously silly and insane terrorist. Great funny parts were given to Bob Hoskins and Jim Broadbent as they make up for what little screen time they have. Katherine Helmond scores high points as the conceited and revolting mother. Kim Griest was the weak link of the top stars, but she still did her best in making her character enlightening. Overall the screenplay was one of the best in the 1980's. It did however tended to lose it welcome after a while though. Gilliam's directing was precise and invigorating, and the lesser credited stuff like sets, costumes and cinematography are some of the best you'll see.Overall, this movie comes off as a film that will make you think. Sure I think two hours and twenty-two minutes might be too long for a movie of this genre, but it does strike a note in originality. The philosophical parables are just a stepping stone into an abysmal dreary look at what our society might face in the future. It's definitely worth seeing and is worth the purchase. Plus if you buy the DVD, the extras are worth considering a look.",Brazil
68,screenman,Gilliam In Overdrive,9,23 September 2009,"Not necessarily an easy movie to score on account of its Da-Da-ism.Gilliam hit popular notoriety with his bizarre cartoon interludes during the 'Monty Python' series. The man clearly had a an amazing imagination mixed with an equivalent sense of humour. There was going to be a lot more to come. Not all of it was good. But 'Brazil' was surely his magnum opus.His work entails more than a shade of Python (naturally), hints of Roald Dahl, and something else uniquely him.Brazil is astonishing. It's almost a take on 1984, with a pretty ineffectual hero standing-in for equally ineffectual Winston Smith. He is an honest and diligent man who discovers a foul-up which he tries to put right, only for things to go disastrously wrong. In time, he finds himself fighting the system and pursuing a rebellious young woman truck driver (Orwell's 'Julia'). As the movie progresses, we are led through a series of tableaux which leave us wondering just how much of what we see is actually in the real world, and how much is the hero's deluded imagination. For those who like neat little denouements it can be a disappointment. The best thing, I think, is to just go along for the ride.That ride takes us through some great parodies of the present. We have set-piece monolithic ministries with incomprehensible bureaucracy. There are legions of dangerously dumb guards, a ruined environment that is boarded-out of view by idealised advertisements and much more. There are also some great characters played very believably by an equally great cast. Small, visual Pythonesque gags pop-up all along the way. Rich old women desperately trying to stay young, cramped little offices were desk space is fought over, unreliable technology and Kafka-esquire confusion. The sniffing machine that got a little too intimate was one of many little touches that had me laughing out loud.You can get lost in this movie. And perhaps that's what Gilliam intended. Whatever it is, it's a piece of unique theatre that does what it does extremely well. You just may not enjoy it. A bit like Dali's cloth watch.",Brazil
69,bkrauser-81-311064,Where hearts were entertaining June,10,30 August 2011,"From Metropolis to V for Vendetta, dystopian futures have become a perennial subject in science-fiction. Generation after generation have made their mark on the genre each having their strengths and weaknesses. They all have the same clichés; a totalitarian government, an ""everyman"" hero, future technologies etc. But out of all of them 1985's Brazil remains, in this writer's opinion the most prolific, unforgettable and foreboding.The story starts with a mix-up in the Ministry of Information where a man is mistaken for a terrorist and is arrested, interrogated and killed. Sam (Jonathan Pryce) a daydreaming low-level pencil pusher with connections, takes on the task of refunding the family for interrogation costs. He then meets the girl of his dreams (Kim Greist) and thus begins his baptism by fire.Brazil plays like a cross between Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and a Roadrunner cartoon. Bulky Rube Goldberg-like machines and unattractive air ducts populate the screen only to be outdone by a vast and ineffectual bureaucracy. ""This is Information Retrieval not Information Dispersal,"" utters Michael Palin's Jack with unintended irony. Those who fight the bureaucracy like rogue air-condition repairman Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro) are enemies of the state. Meanwhile poor, meek Sam struggles to keep his head low and eventually becomes overwhelmed by the sheer madness of it all.In many ways the audience is meant to feel the same sense of bewilderment. Our senses are assaulted with what looks like director Terry Gilliam's mind run amok. The set pieces blur what is real with what Sam imagines in his mind while creating an otherworldly timelessness. The film potentially takes place nowhere yet anywhere. The last fifteen minutes becomes increasingly frantic and there are points where the story just seems to be let loose like a large dog out of a small child's hands. Some may find the feelings evoked by this film to be mind-boggling and ultimately not worth the 132 minute running time.I don't blame them but I can't help but love this film. The plot is not as convoluted as many would insinuate. Sam's main motivation is the girl and his vivid daydreams and the garish set pieces are only the icing on the cake. The acting is superb all around. Jonathan Pryce bungles across the screen like a cocaine addled Don Knotts and the ever competent Robert De Niro steals every scene he's in. Also look out for British darlings like Bob Hoskins, Jim Broadbent and Ian Holm as Sam's incompetent boss. Ultimately while some may poo-poo the film for perceived faults, there is no denying its imagery sticks with you.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Brazil
70,Lady_Targaryen,Suspicion breeds confidence.,6,28 September 2006,"''Brazil '' is directed by Monty Python member Terry Gilliam, but very different from the Monty Python's movies, ''Brazil'' is very depressing and more complicated to understand, since many scenes of the movie defies our logic. I loved Robert De Niro as Tuttle, and it was a surprise to see him in this movie, since it doesn't look the kind of movie he would work in. The movie is not bad, I only expected much more from it, since it is a movie with a high rate here in IMDb, and I saw so many people saying good things about it, even my dad. But I found the movie extremely boring in the beginning, not to mention that Sam's illusions are hard to follow, since you don't know if he is dreaming or actually awake. I don't have problems with surrealism, I don't need ''happy endings'' to enjoy a movie, and usually, I like movies that are not exactly logical or linear, before anyone send me a message saying that I don't understood the plot or I like pre-chewed scripts.I liked the samurai sequence, that was based in Akira Kurosawa films, and also the song ""Aquarela do Brasil"", played in this movie. Akira is one of my favorite directors and ''Aquarela do Brasil'' is a typical song from my country. I also think that this movie is based not only in ""1984"", but also on the works of Franz Kafka, as a guy said in one of the posts from the message board.The plot: Sam Lowry is a lonely hard-working guy, that has his job as a bureaucrat technician while he dreams and fantasies about liberty and a beautiful blond woman that looks like an angel. In one ordinary day of work, Sam sees a woman that is identical to the one of his dreams. He stays curious about her and searches everything he can about her, until he finds out that she is being haunted by the government. Lowry then makes it his mission to save her and to prove to her that she can trust him. At the same time, he becomes friends with Mr. Tuttle, another guy that is being haunted by the government because of his illegal activities. Sam starts the movie having a pacific ordinary life, to, in the middle, only make illegal stuff to help his ''terrorists'' friends.The movie becomes less and less coherent when the end approaches,since Sam is having a lot of hallucinations with his mind becoming more ''destroyed'' then ever. The end is very pessimistic in my opinion, but also original and unexpected, with Sam escaping to a dream world because of his insanity.Ps: I find the character Sam VERY annoying.",Brazil

(R)Wildly imaginative and visually striking dystopian satire from Terry Gilliam is a bit like ""Dr. Strangelove"" meets ""1984"" as designed by Fritz Lang; it's also thoroughly the feverishly busy and darkly fanciful vision-pure of its director, as personal an auteur daydream/nightmare that Gilliam has ever created (except possibly ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen""). Pryce is perfectly cast as the little worker bee crushed by the big totalitarian bureaucracy who has fantastical, heroic dreams and finally fights the power when the woman in those dreams manifests herself in the flesh as a government target; Palin is every bit as good as Pryce's sanguine but utterly unethical friend. In fact, there are no slackers in the cast except for Greist, who sadly doesn't register nearly enough on screen to give Pryce an especially good reason for his obsession. The second half, dominated more by clunky action and undisciplined destruction than the sharper, funnier first half, does drag a bit until reaching the marvelous finale (which was a major point of contention between Gilliam and the studio chairman that refused to release it). Imperfect and best watched multiple times to fully absorb its elaborate designs and concepts, but not to be missed by anyone who enjoys sci-fi, satire, or Gilliam's distinctive style.87/100",Brazil

Throw in a little sword and sorcery, a remembrance of some bad video games from eighties, a bit of Star Wars, perhaps the sci-fi novels ""Level 7"" and ""We,"" sprinkled with Hitlerian moustaches on under developed characters and you get the picture.What's good is a script full of witty one-liners finding the right target, the corporate and governmental bureaucracies, our preoccupation with petty power in the pecking order, and our fear of ageing (face lifts) or looking unregular (braces). What's bad is that Director Terry Gilliam never got it under control. I'm reminded of what Mark Twain said about his magnum opus, ""Anyone attempting to find a plot here will be shot."" The story is slight, lacking any tension and the sets are dark and cluttered to a point past annoyance. I would say the film needed editing for focus, but that would only have spotlighted the poverty of the plot.Here's the problem in a nutshell: recall the line of billboards on both sides of the road mile after mile without a break. Now that's a nice satire of where we're headed as corporate interests increasingly dominate the environment; however like a Rube Goldberg contraption, they don't work since the billboards are too close for anybody to read them as the cars fly by! In a way the world depicted here is like a parallel universe in which everything is essentially the same but differs in a thousand details: the weird little cars, the ridiculous maze of ducts and cables for air conditioning, the over-sized bills on the baseball caps, the single desk sliding between two cubicles, etc.We can see how Gilliam has grown as a film maker by comparing this to ""12 Monkeys,"" produced a decade later. In ""12 Monkeys"" there is not only an interesting story and a subplot, but the characters are developed into flesh and blood. What I think Gilliam has realized is that no director, regardless of how brilliant, can long survive without catering in some way to the mass audience. Although ""Brazil"" ranks in IMDb's top 250 that is only because movie enthusiasts naturally reward creativity. Poll the mass audience however and you'll find a significant percentage that couldn't even sit through this film. Notice too that while Gilliam wasted the talented Robert De Niro in ""Brazil"" he wised up and used star Bruce Willis to the maximum in ""12 Monkeys.""It will be interesting to see what Gilliam does next.",Brazil
73,DJAkin,I want to like this but can't.,3,23 February 2002,"I watched this when I was 15 in 1985 and didn't get it.  So, I decided over a decade later to re-watch it to get a better appreciation for it.  I have to say that it still makes no sense to me.  It's really boring to be honest. It's the Orwell element that drives me nuts.  Bobby DeNiro plays a strange air conditioning repairman who says stuff that doesn't make sense.  This has to be one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.  It's also a close second place to Mission Impossible in terms of hard to understand.  I'd avoid it if I were you.",Brazil
74,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,9,26 August 2010,"Critics (such as the film's most famed detractor- Roger Ebert, whose only point worth noting is his likening the film to Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times) have often compared it to George Orwell's 1984, but, naturally, this is a rather facile comparison, and made mostly because of the plethora of insipidly quotable state sponsored apothegms, like 'Don't suspect a friend- report him,' 'Be alert- some terrorists look normal,' and 'Suspicion breeds confidence.' The state that Sam lives in, in the film, is rather inept (witness the ease with which the rather bumbling Tuttle thwarts the authorities at almost every stage). Sam fails not because the state overpowers him, like Winston Smith to the Oceania authorities in 1984, but because his bumbling and idiocy is even more pathetic than the state's. In effect, Sam fails because he's even more inept and personally weak than the system that subjugates him- he wins the devolutionary race to the bottom (is a Lowest Common Denominator society the cause or result of its citizens?). This is especially true in contrast to De Niro's Tuttle; which augurs well for the citizens of their inept state; whereas the residents of the dismal Orwellian Oceania are doomed.The DVD package comes in three disks. Disk One has the Final Cut, in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio, as well as an audio commentary by director Gilliam. It is lucid, passionate, engaging, and truly a delight. Rare is the filmmaker, outside of Werner Herzog, who seems engaged by discussing both his film, its circumstances, and its art. Gilliam also dispels the myth that the film was named after the title song, Aquarela Do Brasil; instead claiming the title was gotten first (after a dream Gilliam had of the film's opening in a rain forest about to be techno-plundered) and the song added afterwards. It's interesting that in the few dozen reviews I looked at of this film, not a single critic gives the correct provenance for the film's title- even after claiming to have reviewed the DVD. The transfer is very good, and Gilliam gives so much engaging information that it almost makes the special features on Disk Two seem persiflage by comparison. That disk has two excellent documentaries- a contemporaneous 30 minute long What is Brazil? film that serves as a de facto Making Of featurette, and a 60 minute film, called The Battle Of Brazil, that details the film's struggles against its studio, Universal, and its idiotic empty suits, as well as a piece of grandstanding by the Los Angeles Film Critics Society (of which host and film critic Jack Mathews was part of), which chose Brazil as best film of the year to force the studio to release the full version. Other features include the theatrical trailer, storyboards and assorted crew recollections and discussions of the film. Disk Three has the bowdlerized 94 minute version, and a commentary by David Morgan- a film expert on the works and career of Gilliam. While he is dutiful in pointing out when and where the two films diverge, Morgan is rather useless in discussing other aspects of the film, like some of the moments that are unaffected by the changes, and a few actual improvements- such as the substitution of a few close-ups for long shots, or certain angles the camera shoots at, which give a deeper 'in' to the 'moment.' His high point is catching the biggest error Gilliam's bowdlerizers made- leaving in the 'dream sequence' shot of Tuttle getting devoured by windblown newspapers. In the longer version we see this as one of the first hints that Sam's 'escape' from captivity is not real. But, in this version, where the escape is 'real,' Tuttle's demise is more than incongruous, it's an actual thumb in the eye. He follows that up by ending his commentary asking which of the two films is the more subversive- the bowdlerized cut which suggests that power can be subverted, or the final cut which shows the only 'escape' from authoritarianism is death or insanity?As for the film itself, there is no great nor memorable camera work to speak of- the odd angles Gilliam uses are all rather standard fare from his Python days, for this film is almost wholly dependent upon the great screenplay by Gilliam, playwright Tom Stoppard, and Charles McKeown, as well as some truly outstanding (and subtle) comic acting by the stars and supporting cast, which included Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan, and Jim Broadbent. And, when I say 'acting,' I truly mean it. This is acting not built on melodramatic high points, but on often fleeting moments of sardonism where the turn of an eye, or the tic in a face can convey something, both from the main and supporting cast. Pryce, as example, was relatively unknown before this film, while De Niro was in his post-Taxi Driver-Raging Bull heyday as 'the greatest actor in the world,' yet it is Pryce's acting that dominates the film, whereas De Niro's is a supporting role in all measures of the term.Brazil is a theatrical film that is unique. Despite constant and wrongheaded comparisons to other dystopias, it is a film that clearly inspired later filmmakers- most notably Canada's Guy Maddin. But, it also clearly had an inspiration few have noticed- the classic 1967 British television series, The Prisoner. Both works essentially end with the destruction of the individual (even if The Prisoner's lead character 'escapes'- he still is destroyed for he is revealed as the villain) in response to modern society. The only essential difference is that more inept and cowardly Sam Lowry never quite realizes he's a prisoner in The Village (or perhaps does, but refuses his reality, thereby deepening his pathos). All in all, The Criterion Collection's DVD set of the film is equal to the film it presents, and that is something all cinemaphiles can celebrate. Get to it!",Brazil
75,gianmarcoronconi,Bizarre,9,20 July 2021,This film is very beautiful and very particular and describes a very particular and interesting dystopian future. Some points are meaningless and are complicated to understand but overall the plot runs very well.,Brazil
76,Sergiodave,Quite brilliant.,8,3 July 2021,"A great movie that I can only describe as a political satire and a combination of the novels 1984, Brave New World, and The secret life of Walter Mitty. With a superb cast and a typically madcap direction from Terry Gilliam this is one of Gilliam's best, though I can never decide which of his is my favourite. A must watch.",Brazil
77,mentalcritic,1984 and a bit...,9,26 April 2005,"Originally conceived under the title of 1984½, the title change to Brazil was necessitated when the Orwell estate moved to stop the use of an association with George's most enduring work. Given that the title of Orwell's novel is actually Nineteen Eighty-Four, not the number, I suspect the real reason for the change is similar to the reason why Intel stopped using names like the 80486 for their processor architectures. Put simply, one cannot copyright a number. I don't know how this works in entertainment law, but I suspect it might be the reason why Orwell used the words rather than the numbers for his title. But this is all an aside, for Brazil stands up on its own without the need for a connection with Orwell, or indeed any story of a society where the one-size-fits-all approach has gone too far.Brazil is set in a non-specific nation during a non-specific future, although the accents of the cast tend to make an audience believe it is set in England. England has, of course, had a lot of experience with fascist, tyrannical governments, so it makes an ideal setting for this kind of tale. As the story begins, a simple misprint on a series of forms results in the wrong man being kidnapped by the state and taken for what is euphemistically referred to as Information Retrieval. In this rather ghastly process, the state uses up so much electricity or resources that they have started to make those found to be guilty pay for the process. The problem here being that few, if any, individuals who are subjected to this are ever found to not be guilty. Anyway, as the story progresses, we meet our hero, who is little more than a cog in this unwieldy system, and starts quite content to be where he is. When he tries to correct the bureaucratic error that led to the abduction spoken of earlier, however, he opens himself up to all sorts of trouble.To be brutally frank, there is not a whole lot more to this story, and some scenes, such as the dream sequences, don't appear to have been inserted for any other reason than to pad out the running time. The film is helmed by Monty Pythom alumni Terry Gilliam, and the trappings that made Python unbearable for a lot of audiences, myself included, become evident from time to time. Thankfully, British actors have learned to stop reciting their lines as if everything they are saying is coming out of a public address system, but it does get difficult to endure examples of when they haven't. Apparently, Gilliam himself had thoughts like this about much of his cast. Kim Greist's scenes in particular were cut down to reduce her screen time simply due to unhappiness with her performance. I would not be surprised to learn that Robert De Niro's scenes were cut down for similar reasons, as his need to research the roles apparently annoyed the hell out of Gilliam. Ironically, De Niro's character is the only one that seems even vaguely grounded or real a lot of the time. Bob Hoskins deserves a special mention for his amazingly over-the-top performance as Spoor, another bureaucrat who takes a particular disliking to our hero in the midst of the need for emergency repair. If all repairmen were this batty, I think I would be trying to fix a lot more things around my home myself.Unfortunately, Brazil was caught up in the politics of studios wanting to make their films as non-intellectual, non-challenging, non-offensive, and formulaic as possible. As a result, Brazil is available in three versions, at least if you have the Criterion Collection release. The director's preferred version clocks in at around 142 minutes, and is the one available on most DVD presentations. An American edit exists, which is ten minutes shorter. Then there's the Sheinberg edit, or what is known as the Love Conquers All edit. Having viewed a 136-minute (once sped up by a PAL transfer) cut of the film, and having read descriptions of how the Sheinberg edit differs, I am glad I saw what is ostensibly Gilliam's preferred version. One DVD review has it that the 136-minute version is actually a little under seven minutes shorter than the true director's cut, even after the PAL speedup is accounted for. When I did my own crude calculations, the result I came up with was around a minute or two of difference. What a joy it must be to work in the archival departments of film studios.In the end, Terry Gilliam went on to write or direct (or both) better, and certainly less troublesome, productions. Although there are many cosmetic differences, it is easy to guess that this is the same man who shot Twelve Monkeys. You'd never guess that the same man who made Brazil and Twelve Monkeys made The Fisher King, on the other hand. In the end, Brazil comes off as a first-try from a director with great vision. It's not a bad film, but one can plainly see the stress of the production shining through. It will surprise nobody that one scene had to be dropped from the final cut because of the inability to realise the required special effects. As a result, the bright and cheerful look that permeates Brazil comes off more as a sign of daytime-television level directing, rather than the black humour it was intended to be. Still, the result is more than the sum of the parts.Out of ten, I gave Brazil a nine. It is not as brilliant in my view as I have been told it is, but it is not far from that, either. I would agree wholeheartedly with the statement that it is essential viewing. It certainly is more relevant now than was the case in 1985, which is a sad indictment on the way Western society has headed.",Brazil
78,sharky_55,Confess quickly. If you hold out too long you could jeopardise your credit rating.,9,18 August 2015,"Brazil is an odd feature in the genre of the totalitarian dystopia, mainly because of its Kafkaesque tone that never dives too deep or serious. Many have remarked on its 1984 influences from the ministries overseeing the distribution and retrieval of information to the paper message tubes and the plight of a man and women running from larger forces, but Gilliam's style inserts many instances of Python-esque humour and absurdity in the dystopian world of Sam Lowry. One such scene is the tug of war over a small working desk after the reveal of his new tiny office, reminding Ebert of the physical comedy of Chaplin. Jonathan Pryce does everything to sell it, and he is the star performer of the film, as a bundle of nervousness and exasperation, a paper pusher by day but also a daydreamer of greater things. He showcases this in many ways, like that great shot of him peering over the truck's hood, before stammering with great fright: ""Y-you don't trust me...do you?"" He's the very antithesis of a dashing hero who aims to break the system, as demonstrated in that tremendously awkward and incompetent scene where he issues a refund on a dead husband's own arrest. Greist as Jill Layton is perhaps more vanilla, although this is compared to the high standards of Sam's daydreams, and perhaps the writing of the romance is a little rushed. De Niro is the enigmatic rogue engineer turned rebel agent, who plays a leading role in that final escape sequence and throughout as a man of action and mystery that Sam aspires to be. And often forgotten is Palin as Jack Lint, the old friend as the epitome of the successful family man, charming and sociable even as he commits daily torture while forgetting his own daughter's names. In fact, the early reveal of his occupation and high status is a scene that is very telling in revealing the nature of Brazil. The lift swaps grim grey hallways for a spotless white floor, the camera swivelling and following Sam's every move, as he nudges at the one dirty speck on the ground, which smears in a wave of red. The rosy cheeks of the receptionist is standard and well, until we zoom in to what she is typing; a transcript of the horrible yells and screams and pleas of a torture victim. She is however unfazed, rejoining the bleak final scene with the same demeanour. And so too does Jack greet Sam warmly smiling, with those undeniable streaks of red down his coat. All in a day's work in Brazil. Kamen's score is an intriguing one. It works best in those idyllic dream sequences of Sam and that free flowing opening scene up in the clouds where harp glissandos place us right in the wings of the angelic warrior figure. That catchy title theme is glorious and wonderful, and thus even more disturbing in the final scene. And those exuberant triumphant fan fares once Sam and Jill finally kiss and consummate their relationship are exhilarating, almost overly so. Elsewhere noir-esque saxophone fills accentuate the misty and grim architecture of the high rise apartment blocks, each uniform and cramped, an atmosphere not unlike that in Blade Runner. They help showcase the stunning attention to detail in the set design, dark but beautiful and at times claustrophobic (accentuated by Gilliam's preference of wide lenses). They also create an ethereal sound bridge to those surreal daydream sequences. And the iconic Office Theme is simply great, buzzing with rhythm and emphasising that corporate intensity as part of the government force of records. However when Kurtzmann goes back into his office, the worker's ethic dissipates and they switch their attention back to the television screen. This is the world of Brazil; it's both imposing and peculiar. This is most evident in the fantastic scene after Sam's capture, where we gaze out from the restricted file of vision from inside that horrible suit and the POV swivels and blinks with fear. Each blink represents yet another suit rattling off a list of heinous crimes against the government, with the whole debacle with Buttle subtly inserted as a demonstration of the meticulousness of the state. All while silhouettes of torture victims are shepherded along in the next room, and the suits outline payment options for Sam's own arrest and prosecution. It's a scene created with such terror, yet sort of ridiculous in its approach of the totalitarian mindset. One might easily think that the state was setting off bombs and blaming terrorism as a way of inciting fear and criticism of any rebellion. In Brazil, the central authority is simply too incompetent to deal with such a mess of infrastructure, with all the paperwork that must be filed, that explosions have began to be inevitable. It's a sharp satire of the over-powerful and overreaching bureaucracy with its uptight adherence to regulation and order and invasive policy and regime that descends into an incompetent and terrifying mess. What a more telling way for Tuttle to depart than to be swamped by the mass of paperwork that he rebels against. And what a series of events that started from a tiny insignificant fly. The 'Buttle-fly effect', if you will. Of course, that is all yanked away in the brutal final scene, a testament to the haunting long shots that emphasise the towering architecture of dominance of the state from the prominent golden statue to the monolithic brick walls of Information Retrieval to the sheer cliffs of the pit of despair that we lose Sam Lowry in. How we long for that idealistic ending. Please make sure that you watch the uncut version of Brazil, which Gilliam fought tooth and nail for a release, against a very different proposed 90 minute film which dilutes the message and creates an entirely divergent ending (rightly dubbed the 'Love Conquers All' cut).",Brazil
79,gftbiloxi,Dancing Between Dream States: An Extraordinary Film,10,3 February 2008,"Swirling together ideas from such writers as Kalfa and Orwell and artists like Escher, Terry Gilliam's 1985 BRAZIL is visually stunning--and so disorienting, disturbing, and disconcerting that Universal refused to release it. A very public battle eventually forced the studio to recant, but by the time the film reached theatres public interest in the film was past the crest. The film did not really come into its own until it began to reach the home market, and a remarkably fine DVD from Criterion is the result.Some people describe BRAZIL as science-fiction; some describe it as future prophecy; in actual fact it is a bit of both and lots of other things as well. Although the film has an odd Anglo-Latin quality, it might be set at any time and in any place. Whatever the case, it presents us with a society collapsing under the weight of its own technology, a world in which bureaucracy has run amok, terrorists challenge the status quo, and the general public is largely indifferent to the whole thing as long as it doesn't affect them personally.When a bug is splattered inside a computer, it results in the wrongful arrest of an innocent man--and through a series of odd circumstances plunges a low level and unassuming government employee into a series of romantic but ultimately nightmarish adventures expose the truly sinister nature of the ruling government, adventures that range from bombings to hideous torture, from beautiful surfaces to grotesque underpinnings.The film has a unique look, dancing between dream states and the stark world against which they occur; it is often beautiful, but it is all a bit off-kilter, and as the film progresses that off-kilter edge grows and grows into a profound paranoia all the more unnerving due to the visual beauty of the film. The script is interesting, the story is intelligent and ultimately frightening, and the performances are very sound indeed.BRAZIL is one of those ""either-or"" films that you love or hate, that you get or don't get. I find that I tend to admire the film more than I actually like it--but no matter your reaction, there's no escaping the fact that this is one of the ""must see"" films of the 1980s. Criterion's DVD is excellent. Hardcore fans will likely want the three disk edition, but this will do the trick for most viewers. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Brazil

It may have been too rich by half for studio suits, but it's one of director Terry Gilliam's finest moments.

81,gab-14712,"Inside Terry Gilliam's Weird, Dystopian World!",8,7 July 2020,"Terry Gilliam, the creative genius behind Monty Python, is back with a very weird dystopian drama, Brazil. The film is clever, visually creative, and did I mention weird? Yeah, the film is really weird which is normal for Gilliam. Still, the film is an effective retelling of George Orwell's 1984. Gilliam created a film about a failing society that operates under bureaucratic nonsense. The film could have been super serious, but Gilliam uses dark comedy and his style of strangeness to elevate the story. It is not to everyone's taste I need to warn. Some people may think the film goes nowhere or would not understand what is going on. Not even I am sure if I fully understand what was happening, but I was down for it.The film had a checkered past. The studio Universal was very hesitant to release the movie the way Gilliam wanted. The film ended on a dark note, but the studio wanted to give it a happy ending to make it more accessible for consumers a la Blade Runner. Gilliam created a public battle to keep his film the way it is. He showed his cut to local critics and friends. Once the film began to receive award recognition, Universal relented and released the film Gilliam intended. Sadly, the box office goals were not reached. It did receive nearly unanimous critical support and was nominated for two Academy Awards, so that meant something. This isn't my favorite Gilliam film, but I am happy it received some support.The film gathered some recognition thanks to its visual style. The way the film was shot-with extreme wide angles-was something that is rarely used. Gilliam and cinematographer Roger Pratt worked together to create something unique. They also worked on some interesting lighting techniques. If the way the film is shot seemed so familiar, it inspired future films. One film that comes to mind is Tim Burton's 1989 superhero flick, Batman. The film also used some visual effects to its advantage. The film was intended to be in a world much like our own, but more destructive and counterproductive. I think Gilliam achieved his goal with the use of special effects. And the way some of the characters looked! Katherine Helmond comes to mind with her unique character design.In the not-so-distant future, the world is ran by an extremely bureaucratic government that uses its computer system to track down terrorists. Like all computer systems, they can be prone to ""bugs."" A bug is the reasoning that Harry Tuttle (Robert De Niro), a known terrorist was mixed up with a man named Buttle. Due to the mixup, Buttle died from heart issues. A government employee, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is called in to investigate this error. Buttle's neighbor, Jill Layton (Kim Greist) is trying to report the mistake to the government but fails because of the insane amount of paperwork that needs to be processed (bureaucracy problems, eh). Sam has these fantasies and many of them are about Jill. Because of his fantasies, it is a matter of time before the government deems Sam counterproductive.Many of the performances are all delightful...and strange in their own way. Jonathan Pryce is excellent as the ""average"" Sam. He provided moments of levity when needed. The scene where he watches old TV shows when the boss's back is turned comes to mind. I could not quite buy his relationship with Jill Layton, played by Kim Greist. Unfortunately, those were some weak moments within Gilliam's script. The rest of the cast is basically glorified cameos, and all were excellent. In particular, Robert De Niro stole the show. Never would I believe that playing with wires would make for some good scenes, but here we are. Keep an eye out for characters played by Bob Hoskins, Ian Holm, and Jim Broadbent.I definitely liked the hard dystopian edge Gilliam gave the film. People are leading lives under circumstances of control and paranoia. The police are shown coming through the ceiling and beating down any opposition. In other words, life is grim and the furthest thing away from happy. This is Gilliam's version of an Orwellian world and through the use of his production design, cinematography, and Michael Kamen's score, it really shines. Luckily, there is some humor and weirdness to make you at least chuckle at some point.There is no denying that Brazil is a strange film. But that is what happens when Terry Gilliam is in charge of a picture. It may not have done bonkers box office or won a boatload of awards, but people do consider it one of his best films. Perhaps not me, but I still found much to enjoy in all its weirdness. The script could have used more tightening, but that's just me. I enjoyed the film for what it is and I can recommend it.My Grade: B+",Brazil
82,Angry_Arguer,Hit a Chord,9,12 November 2003,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is twofold in structure.  On the one hand, it is the shallow ""Monty Python and George Orwell"".  On the other is the obsession with dreams.  James Cameron has a similar problem and it would be not-to-dissimilar if he did a version of this film.  The characters sleep, they dream, they concoct bizarre illusions in the deepest recesses of their minds, and then accept them as truth.Wow!  Not far off from some of the reviews I read here!In terms of science-fiction, this is rather shallow.  I did find Robert DeNiro's performance particularly clever and the production design is something to behold.  After all, in the dystopian worlds we create, it is typical for us to envision crammed spaces with large, insanely-detailed junk.  Brazil combines that with a monolithic and monochrome fascination, but is still pretty impressive.  While the serious nature of other films (namely Dark City) is lost in the design, it's all for gags this time.So, when the choice comes between Slaughterhouse-Five, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and this.  Brazil comes on top of my ""to see"" list.Overall, the original director's cut ranks as one of the most visual experiences ever undertaken.  Visuals alone can't float the movie, though. Perhaps more questioning and probing of our humanity in subtle ways would have worked better.  3 out of 5.",Brazil
83,Maziun,George Orwell meets Monty Python,9,31 December 2013,"Early title for this movie was ""1984 and a 1/2"". The film was inspired by George Orwell's ""1984"" , although he never actually read the book. The main core of the story is the same (a man falls in love with a woman and becomes an enemy of the state) , but most of the plot and characters are different from Orwell's book . This is movie inspired by Orwell , not ripping-off him. Gilliam took some ideas from Orwell , added his own ideas plus his style (black humor) and in the result we have a movie that works better as a adaptation of Orwell's book than ""1984"" by Michael Radford (which is in it's own way a great movie).This is the second in Terry Gilliam's ""Trilogy of imagination"". All three films are about escapes from an awkward and ordered society, seen through the eyes of a child (""Time bandits"") , a man in his 30s (""Brazil"") , and an elderly man (""The Adventures of baron Munchausen"").The movie is named after the song ""Aquarela do Brasil"", known in the English-speaking world simply as ""Brazil"", written by Ary Barroso. Almost all of the soundtrack music by Michael Kamen is a variation on the main melody in the song ""Brazil"". Sam Lowry and Harry Tuttle are humming the melody at some point of movie. The story behind the name of the film relates to Terry Gilliam being at a beach in the UK one day. The weather was ugly , yet there was a man sitting on the beach and listening to the radio which played this song. The song ""Brazil"" is probably of symbol of beauty, desire , longing and freedom.The world of ""Brazil"" is dystopia set sometime in the present . The movie isn't specific about when. The world here has a surrealistic , retro look : citizens wear clothes like from noir movies , the police wear Nazi suits , the technology here reminds one from a 50's science fiction movie. The city looks like something that could appear in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"". What is amazing is that almost all the surreal locations were shot in the real world (for example the torture chamber) ! The set art direction is breathtaking.The narrative story is not always the driving force of the film . It is sometimes muddled and that is perhaps a reason while this otherwise well written movie didn't won Oscar for best screenplay (It was nominated though). The story is both simple and complex with many subplots. This movie might require repeated viewings to really understand it's meaning.""Brazil"" is mostly about life in a totalitarian dystopic society , consumer society (""Consumers for Christ"") , the lunacy of the bureaucracy. It's also about the crush of technology and it's effect on society. Most of the technology in the film fails constantly and causes more problems than solutions. Sam's mother represents obsession with youth and cosmetic surgery. ""Brazil"" also points out the loss natural environment , but more importantly the loss of humanity (lack of responsibility and empathy).""Brazil"" is very funny satire , black comedy that helps us to watch Sam's struggle in this crazy world . This cruel world is based on violence, bureaucracy and technology, where freedom is being completely destroyed, where terror is being done not only by terrorists but by the government itself. I'm afraid that ""Brazil"" is a prophecy of things to come. It's utterly horrifying thought.Jonathan Pryce (""Ronin"") is charming as the love struck , unconfident , clumsy day dreamer Sam Lowry. His great as the every man. Michael Palin (Monty Python member) is good as Lowry's two-faced friend Jack . Robert De Niro makes a nice five minute appearance as a chirpy plumber/terrorist Tuttle. His got a perfect British accent and I rather watch him for five minutes in a good movie than appearing in one of those crap movies his now making. Ian Holm is memorable as the twitchy Mr. Kurtzmann , just like Bob Hoskins (""Who framed Roger the rabbit"") as Spoor the psycho repair man . Katherine Helmond is the best female here as the obsessive mother of Sam .Kim Greist as the heroine is a bit weak , but doesn't destroy the movie.There are many small details you can notice on repeated viewings : propaganda slogans that can be seen in the background throughout the film , shootout at the stairs that is a homage to the film """"Battleship Potemkin"", executive decision maker that Sam keeps getting and giving , wearing a baby mask while torturing people .In my opinion this is Gilliam's finest work and one of the best 80's science fiction movies. A true work of art. I give it 9/10.",Brazil
84,K3nzit,Sci-Fi classic,8,3 January 2020,"Original and inventive. 'Brazil' has a special vibe to it and is similar to 'Blade Runner' in that sense. They both pull you in to their future world and are visually spectacular, down to the smallest detail. 'Brazil' is also a film that is long and has many scenes that feel unnecessary. But even if the movie feels long, its still a Sci-Fi classic one MUST see.",Brazil
85,rebeljenn,a disappointment,1,19 March 2004,"It's been about six years now since I've seen this film, and my only memory of it was thinking how incoherent and slow-moving it was. There are many thought-provoking areas, but it just seemed to me as if everything was thrown together to give the appearance of a wonderful and 'artistic' film.... to pretend that it was an intelligent film. Funnily, many people like it, but it's more of a cult following than a mainstream film. (I couldn't believe how many people do regard this as a wonderful film as it has received so many high ratings.) Overall, I just found it uninteresting and incoherent. Something about the film must appeal as it does have its following. I suppose you either really like it or really hate it, and I am just one of the people that dislike it. (And I am a fan of this genre.)",Brazil
86,petarmatic,Absolutely fantastic!,9,20 January 2014,"When they made this film I did not expect much. Was I wrong!?! It is probably one of the best films ever made, do not mind what they say on IMDb page. I do not think it even made to top 250 films according to them. Well they are wrong! Foe every person who wants to see a combination of sci fi/futuristic tragedy/Monty Python type of film this is the one to see.Acting is superb, plot is out of this world. Lord how did they even think about all these things? Where did they come up with these brilliant ideas? It certainly left me with an awe! To cut the long story short! Obtain this film and watch it!

87,ofpsmith,Absurd in the best way.,9,25 March 2016,"One of my favorite novels of all time is George Orwell's 1984, and Brazil is very much a comedic interpretation of that. Brazil shows us a hilarious exaggeration of the monotony of machine like run bureaucracy, and man's constant voyage to avoid responsibility. ""That's not my department."" Everyone seems to say. Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) is a low ranking government employee. When an error leads to the execution of engineer Archibald Buttle (Brian Miller) instead of terrorist Archibald Tuttle (Robert De Niro), Sam attempts to fix this, and inadvertently becomes an enemy of the state. Read that scenario again. This is a funny movie. It's a dark comedy/political satire, and almost every joke works. The nonchalant attitude of the government depicted in the film is where a big chunk of the humor comes from. It's a very smart comedy. Honestly if you like political satire, then Brazil is one we can all enjoy together.",Brazil

Even though the somwhat vague imagery can hint towards a deeper meaning, most messages are superficial. Maybe ifs more because its a product of its time, mostly pointing towards the types of critique and humor, but the whole messaging came off a little hollow. But nontheless, with the many original visuals it kept me interested and made me enjoy the movie to an acceptable extend.6/10: hollow but original.",Brazil
89,eibon09,Terry Gilliam's 1984,9,8 November 2000,"Brazil(1985) is a great SCIFI feature that's one of the most visually rewarding films to watch.  The movie deals with a computer error that causes havoc for the protagonist, Sam Lowry.  Sam Lowry is someone who dreams of living as an individual, away from the system of Big Brother.  The movie is heavily influenced by George Orwell's classic novel, 1984.  Brazil(1985) is the closest thing to a perfect adaptation of 1984 for the big screen.
Brazil(1985) is more well known for what happened behind the scenes than anything that happens in the film.  There was a bitter battle between the director and producer that ended up in the cutting of the film much to Terry Gilliam's disapproval.  As a result there are three cuts of the film(director, studio, TV).  I've seen both the 142Minute and 132Minute version.  In my opinion, the 142Minute edition is the definite one to watch.
Jonathan Pryce as Sam Lowry does a great act in showing someone who is imprisoned by the system.  Robert De Niro plays Sam Lowry's alter ego, Harry Tuttle in an eccentric role for the actor.  At first De Niro wanted the role of Sam's best friend but instead got the role of the spy Harry Tuttle.  The film retains the forbidden love affair between Sam Lowry and Jill Layton that is an important element in 1984.  A lot of scens that involved Kim Griest were cut due to the dissatifaction of her performance from the director.
Brazil(1985) is Terry Gilliam's masterwork and a well directed piece by the filmmaker himself.  The set designs are dazzling and the depiction of city life is nothing short of amazing.  The title song is one of the most famous tunes.  Much better then 12 Monkeys(1996) because this is a more complete film.  Brazil(1985) is part of a trilogy that includes Time Bandits(1981) and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen(1988).
This trilogy is really about the progression of life that begins in Childhood, continues in Middleage, and ends with Old age.  Brazil(1985) is really about the uncertainties of middleage.  The samurai dream sequences are a marvalous example of the symbolisms they provide for the movie.  Bob Hoskins gives a dark humorous act as a government plumber.  The dream sequences with Sam Lowry and his dream girl are beautifully romantic.",Brazil
90,redkiwi,What is it?,7,14 June 2003,"What is this film?  Is it a comedy?  A thriller?  An Orwellian insight into what the future may be?  Why is it called Brazil after all?Or is it just another in the weird journeys through Terry Gilliam's mind?The latter is what I'd tend to favour.  Jonathan Pryce's best role as the grey government official trying to dream a real life with the help of an excellent virtuoso performance from Robert De Niro really does take some watching, and you do have to concentrate all the way through to get it.Mad, weird and strange.  But not bad all the same.",Brazil
91,Imdbidia,Original and fun,8,3 March 2011,"Brazil is a metaphorical movie about a crazy grey futuristic world driven by rotten bureaucracy and about the willingness of individuals to escape their reality through day-dreaming and dreams. It is also a critique to some of the sins and obsessions of our society (still valid despite these being pinpointed in the 1980s): incompetent and self- absorbed bureaucracy, the obsession with Youth and plastic surgery, censorship, terrorism, and social and media manipulation, among many others.The movie is very irreverent and humorous, so none of the serious themes explored in the movie are examined in a serious way. The moral of the story is lying beneath it, clearly visible, under a comic story that is sometimes nightmarish, sometimes real, and sometimes dreamlike.The movie has an unique and original visual style, brilliant if we take into account that the especial effects are all mechanical and not digital, and that some of them were really difficult to bring to life at the time. All the day-dreaming and dreams segments are brilliantly shot and presented, as well as the impacting images related to the interrogation at the end, shot inside a thermonuclear plant.The atmosphere of the movie is excellent, very grey and beige, as the world it depicts. It uses a mix of elements of the fashion and style of the 1950s and 1980s to create an undated 20th century future. This mix of contemporary and retro is extremely original and innovative, still nowadays. In fact, it has fed the aesthetics of movies nowadays considered visually innovative, like the movies by French director Jean- Pierre Jeunet (City of Lost children, Delicatessen, Micmacs, etc.).Most actors are all great in leading and supporting roles. The physique and acting of Jonathan Pryce are perfect for the role of Sam Lowry, with that mix of normality, vulnerability, naughtiness and dreaminess that his character requires. Also brilliant and very funny is Katherine Helmond as his eccentric mother Ida. Robert de Niro is also great in his small supporting role as subversive independent heating technician, as well as Bob Hoskins as the legal heating technician, Ian Holm as incompetent Mr. Kurtzmann, and Michel Palin as the butcher of the information central office. I did not like the heroine actress Jill Layton, played by Kim Greist, who is great when she's posing, but not so much when she's acting.The O.S.T. is mostly the song Brazil played over and over in different arrangements, from playful to dramatic. The music works perfectly, and reminds the viewer all through the story that Brazil is out there, a better place with which to dream, a perfect destination to where escape from the greyness of our boring world and lives.Fantastic conception, very original and though-provoking. and extremely entertaining. Still, a little too long to me.The European poster of the movie is excellent and really shows what the core of the movie is in one image.",Brazil
92,Antagonisten,Disjointed,4,11 July 2006,"I have to admit i have always had something of a problem with Terry Gilliam. And having a problem with Terry Gilliam and watching this film is kind of like eating something you're allergic to. The reaction is instant because this movie is just so much Terry Gilliam.The word that i usually drift towards when watching one of his works is ""absurd"". It seems to me that the feeling of absurdity is what he always aims at. Usually he also hits his target. The question though is if this makes his movies good or not. Of course things are not that simple. It's always possible to admire or appreciate something without actually liking or enjoying it. That being said i can't really say i've ever enjoyed one of Gilliams films (i came closest with ""Twelve Monkeys""), but i have admired a couple of them for their undeniable originality and intelligence.""Brazil"" was difficult for me. The Orwellian world in which it takes place is a very dominating factor in the movie. Although i perceived it to be about humanity (as are most such sad visions of the future) the humans here really take a backseat. The setting, this future world, is grand and painstakingly overworked. From the smallest hissing pipe to the greatest open space there is an attention to detail that speaks volumes about both vision and lack of budget restraints. Of course today the future in Brazil seems irreparably old and dated, but that is almost always the case with science-fiction and visions of the future and it didn't bother me.What did bother me however was that i didn't really know how to follow the storyline in Brazil. Of course one might say that the storyline was not the point here, and you might be right but i find that to be a problem in and of itself. Characters enter from the side without good explanations, things happen that i understood very little about and of course dream sequences were added and spliced in a way that sometimes made it difficult to know what was reality or dream. Probably that was also something deliberate.In the end i think that me and Mr. Gilliam simply don't mix. His brand of very black comedy just doesn't strike the right note with me. It's absurd to the point where i don't know how to react. And here we have two hours of disjointed storyline and bizarre events that sometimes seem to have very little to do with each other. It's not the kind of black comedy you laugh at, and at the same time it didn't feel heartfelt in any real way. An impressive display of vision and budget no doubt, and with a surprisingly good ending (of course i count on understanding the story enough to judge), but lacking something to keep it all together.",Brazil
93,raypdaley182,Sheer Genius,7,3 January 2008,"There are at least 5 versions of Brazil. The European version. The US Version. The Final Cut. The ""Love Conquers All"" Cut. The DVD cut.All of these are different and I've seen all except the US version. The ""Love Conquers All"" version is disowned by Gilliam and was edited by a guy called Steinburg to give a happy ending.Gilliams cuts are the dark fantasy world, keeping Sam Lowry (Jonathon Pryce) as the hero who is stuck in a world of red tape, paper work and bureaucracy. The visuals are stunning, the cast has many big names and recognizable faces. The writing is amazing coming from Gilliam, Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown.The best cut of the film is the non-happy ending of a tortured Sam Lowry who has turned into himself and escaped into his own catatonia where his fantasy world exists within his mind.Any version of this is worth a viewing. Even the sappy ""Love Conquers All"" version.",Brazil
94,Horror-yo,"Overrated, but strong",7,21 May 2016,"Terry Gilliam writes and directs this, the dude who made the Monty Pythons. The Python influence is dearly felt here too, what with the awkward, bogus scenes of over-exaggerations and over-over-exaggerations. It also feels very Python-like in how light its purpose is. On one hand the film is extremely colorful, visually and artistically proficient, with meaning constantly coming symbolically/figuratively or implicitly, rather than explicitly; and on the other it indeed lacks depth at that. There is a little something lacking for this to be great and although it isn't far it assuredly isn't there either. Jonathan Pryce does a superb job as the lead in this dystopian comedy that is only as much a comedy as it is a tragic, depressing drama. The only hope resides in hopelessness, as the movie ultimately invites to believe. Like any 1984 'spinoff', this is heavy criticism of current society in its most gruesome portrait - like a nightmare; and threads of anything human still are scarce. Overall while the film offers serious doses of imagination and dream with all the aesthetics and abstract meaning entailed, I would reiterate it still feels a bit light as a whole, like it had all the right tools in hand but fell short of realizing its full potential in a more concrete way.",Brazil
95,garethcrook,Nothing works in the future.,8,28 December 2018,"I thought it time I revisited this modern classic. I know this isn't a popular opinion, but I really didn't enjoy this when I first watched it some 20 years ago, but I've come to understand that I wasn't always that open to all that cinema had to offer back then. So when better to give this Christmas oddity another go then now and wow am I glad I did! It's wonderful in every sense of the word. A beautifully grimy, lovingly choreographed dystopian nightmare fantasy. Full of chunkily wired future tech and absurd authority figures. An hysterical look at the farce of bureaucracy, perfectly rooted somewhere between it's time and an imagined time to come. I dread to think how a film with this imagination would be handled now, probably something similar to scenes in Ready Player One and it would be horrendous for it. This works so well because everything's real. Real sets, costume, the entire world. There's an amazing DIY tangibility to it's failed utopia, but it's the strength of the characters scurrying around in its war torn noir maze that makes this so watchable. Nothing works in the future. How right Gilliam was. Pure genius. I was a fool to ever doubt.",Brazil
96,PIST-OFF,"1984, only funny",9,22 April 1999,"Terry Gilliam needs to do more movies like this and 12 Monkeys. Here he does probably one of the most confusing and funny movies I've ever seen. This gem is also probably the most under rated and under appreciated film in existence. Catching some of the quickly paced jokes is hard to do and following the plot is next to impossible for first time viewers. But it's well worth it to see this comical look at a dystopian nightmare paper clogged future world. Robert DeNiro has a great great part as guerilla warfare heating engineer repairman. Plus DeNiro happens to be a favorite of mine. Jonathan Pryce does a good enough job in this movie if you try not to remember that he is that annoying Lexus guy. Stories of Terry Gilliam's fight with the studio ,to get his version of the movie shown, are legendary. See it. Watch carefully.",Brazil
97,MichaelMargetis,The Most Frightening Peek into the Future from Monty Python favorite Terry Gilliam.,8,20 April 2005,"Looking back on 'Brazil', the absolutely insane drama/comedy/futuristic nightmare of a film from Monty Python alumni Terry Gilliam, I realized this has to be the most terrifying look into the future ever expressed in film. That's right, out of all the other scary futuristic films, 'Brazil' certainly holds the saddest and most disappointing future. There's a lot of debate over this underrated 80's flick, some love it and some hate it because they just can't quite understand it. There's no debate that it is a confusing mind-tease, but it's like my English teacher says ""It's art."" 'Brazil' certainly is art, it's a beautiful and powerful, yet lavishly abstract portrait of the dark and gloomy depths our society might one day sink to.'Brazil' takes place somewhere undisclosed in the future, and it follows an average Joe-schmo (played expertly by British veteran film actor Jonathon Pyrce -- you may remember him from playing the comical street smart engineer in the original Broadway version of 'Miss Saigon'), who is unhappy with the world around him. His extremely narcissistic and vain mother (played by Katherine Helmond) is always pressuring him to be the best, but he just wants to be an average guy. He works at a filing company, and all goes wrong when a poor man, Mr. Buttle, gets mistaken for an international terrorist fighting the government, Harry Tuttle (played by U.S. veteran Robert De Niro). Our average Joe-Schmo, whose name is actually Sam Lowry, goes on a mission to stop this, but along the way gets tied-in with Harry Tuttle, and another terrorist fighting the government (Kim Griest), who is also the woman Sam dreams about every night. After that, it's hard to explain what happens in this jumbled yet great Sci-Fi classic.There are a lot of positive things to be said about the motion picture 'Brazil', however there are a lot of negative things to be said also. The acting is fantastic as one would expect with such greats as Robert DeNiro, Kim Griest, Michael Palin (another one of Python's old members), Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Ian Richardson, Jim Broadbent, Katherine Helmond, and of course, Jonathon Pryce. Jonathon Pryce provides us with perhaps his most brilliant screen performance. He plays Sam Lowry with such devotion, intensity and such shocking realism that it is downright wrong that he didn't get an Academy Award Nomination. DeNiro is also great providing us with a role we rarely get to see him in (instead of playing a stone cold mobster, he plays a silly and neurotic international terrorist). Jim Broadbent and Bob Hoskins are both very funny, while Katherine Helmond portrays one of the most annoying mothers in film history. I wasn't too impressed with Kim Griest's performance, however she did pull it off. The screenplay is spectacular in 'Brazil' for the most part, the second half starts to really drag though. Terry Gilliam's directing is spot-on, and the costumes, set, makeup, cinematography and film editing of 'Brazil' prove most impressive. In conclusion 'Brazil' is a great film if you have an open mind. It drags a lot towards the end, but one thing you can't hold against 'Brazil' is it's striking originality. It's definitely a great mind-teaser, and features some very philosophical moments that will make us reflect on ourselves as a society. All in all, 'Brazil' is definitely worth seeing, and if you like it enough to get it on DVD, purchase the 3-Disc Critierion Collection that features the film's director's cut which is about fourteen minutes longer then the theatrical version.

98,Ali_John_Catterall,An empty desk is an efficient desk,10,22 November 2009,"Directed by an American, and written by a Czech-born playwright (Tom Stoppard), Brazil - where Monty Python meets Franz Kafka and George Orwell - is nevertheless as British as Big Ben, skewering a peculiarly homegrown strain of small-minded, receipt-issuing bureaucracy (and state-sanctioned torture). Gilliam admits he hadn't actually read 1984 before making it, but the results get remarkably close to the tone and feel of Orwell's novel, with its shabby future-retro technology and terribly polite torturers, while Kim Greist makes a great surrogate Julia to Pryce's Winston Smith.

The music is absolutely spectacular and Brazil is, in many ways, such a perfect sci-fi satire of the world we live in now, and on the human condition, that it verges on a special kind of realism.

As with all great films, there's no need to describe specific scenes or events to justify its greatness. Finally, let me link this film with Monty Python works. Terry Gilliam proves here why comedy is a very serious matter. Brazil is not comedy, although it has its moments, but he makes evident that a good comedian can produce a much deeper and dramatic film than a ""serious"" director.",Brazil
101,willcundallreview,A firmly good Fantasy,7,31 March 2014,"Brazil is a film that at it's core is one man's crazy idea mixed up with beautiful sets and great gadgets to create a move that is fun and bright. With a fun if not dark story, it goes along and serves to entertain and with acting to match the insanity going on in the plot of the film, you should enjoy the madness. I personally felt the film was firmly good, I did feel it was overrated but still, it is a good movie.The story is strange but good and what ever goes down in it is fun and bright and only serves for you to enjoy it. It isn't an easy story to predict either and with some quirky going's on you can't help feel thrilled by this piece. A thing that really stands out about the plot is that it's in this weird dystopian future where everything is done differently and you feel as if you have literally woken up in Terry Gilliam's dreams.Jonathan Pryce in the main role is good in portraying his odd character who seems to be the only one who see's how flawed society is, and with strong support from the likes of Robert De Niro, you can see why this film is rated so highly. The characters are pretty much all crazy and meeting anyone of them in real life would be a challenge, they are fun to see though and it always seem's that Pryce's character is put into different situations constantly and it is great to see how they all turn out.Terry Gilliam at the technical helm as Director and one of the writers makes this film fun and creates a smart feeling film, but I couldn't help feel that the script isn't that smart and I fail to see why some rate this THAT highly. I did love the sets and even when using small toy sets for large shots, it works perfectly and you will see what I mean when De Niro zip lines from buildings, it is kind of funny to just see the little toy fly down into the streets, the sets work very well though and pass for reality.Criticisms well, the story is very stuffy and chocked full of things to get a grip on and so if you started watching about a quarter way through, you would be already be lost forever. I didn't feel the British feel of the film paid off well as the film is full of Brit's(and a few famous from UK TV) but they fail to materialise into a hilarious film. One more thing is the overrating, the story is good as I have said but it isn't cutting edge and although the idea is cool, it isn't executed to perfection, and is why I didn't rate it as a great film as so many others do.Those who like Gilliams work will be superbly pleased with this as his quirky ideas and mind pay off in this to create well, a quirky story. I also felt that people who like a cult classic kind of film to be a part of, this may be for you as the film has genuine feeling to it and even the ideas can sometimes be used in are society today. People who want a straight serious film then don't see it as the quirkiness makes it kind of funny at times, and takes any serious Drama parts away for good.Overall felt it was Firmly Good but as I say not any more so than that. This is a film I feel you should enjoy and if you have seen his work before then definitely you will, but if you also want a crazy film, set in the future then this really really really for you because, that is what it is. The kind of film to put your feet up to and just enjoy, you may even come out with a few new ideas on what or who is running society in our world today.",Brazil
102,rdoyle29,A dystopian masterpiece,10,2 July 2017,"Gilliam's dystopian masterpiece is set in a near future where bureaucracy has taken over all aspects of life. Jonathan Pryce stars as an unambitious functionary who dreams of being a winged hero who saves a beautiful girl from monsters. While attempting to close off a case where the wrong man was arrested and murdered due to a typo, he meets this woman in real life. Gilliam constructs a labyrinthine satire about how technology and bureaucracy destroy everything that makes life good. The film's retro-1940s-noir-future look enhances the satire by filling the film with elaborate, near-useless archaic technology that hinders the characters at every turn. Pryce has never been better and is ably supported by a magnificent cast that includes Ian Holm, Michael Palin, Robert DeNiro and Bob Hoskins.

103,gsygsy,the stuff of dreams,8,3 August 2013,"Nothing can fully prepare you for BRAZIL. Maybe it's Cervantes' DON QUIXOTE as dreamed by Franz Kafka then written up by Lawrence Sterne. But that doesn't do justice to Terry Gilliam's cinematic bravura.Gilliam is an extravagant director. His work teems with stuff. He is, in this respect, comparable to Baz Lurhmann, and the comparison is instructive. Lurhmann's work feels confined by his stories, as if he's trying to escape them through visuals. Gilliam's films feel more satisfying, at least to me, because the images ARE the story. BRAZIL won't be to the taste of every moviegoer, I'm sure, but, if you surrender to it, you'll be taken on a roller-coaster ride: thrilling, scary, exhausting, something you say you never want repeat as you join the queue to do it all over again. It is a dystopian tale, and to that extent has a seriousness of purpose that some might think gets lost beneath the extravagance of what's on screen, but I don't share that view. Gilliam's imagination yields a poetic dreamscape which by-passes rationality. It's an environment that makes the dystopia all the more vivid.Savoring the performances is one way of digesting this rich dish. Playing the discontented hero, Sam Lowry, is Jonathan Pryce, a renowned British stage actor. His is a curious presence, without much charm, but undoubtedly charismatic. A quartet of principal relationships stem from his character: his vain mother, played by wonderful Katherine Helmond; the object of his desire, played flatly but efficiently by Kim Griest; his non-conformist alter-ego played by a brilliantly-cast Robert De Nero, strangely but effectively out of step with everyone else's acting style; and, as Sam's conformist antagonist, Michael Palin, charming and chilling in equal measure.Surrounding this central quintet is an unequalled collection of British character actors, some on screen for merely a few seconds, providing Gilliam with an entirely believable world of eccentrics. Those flashing by include Ann Way, Harold Innocent, John Grillo, Oscar Quitak and Ralph Nossek. In slightly larger roles come Jim Broadbent, Bryan Pringle, Gordon Kaye, Bob Hoskins and (dazzling) Ian Richardson. In fully-fledged support are Barbara Hicks, superb Kathryn Pogson, Ian Holm, Peter Vaughan and, giving heart to the only realistic role in the entire movie, the great Sheila Reid.The production design is amazing, the photography superb, and the editing, which must have been quite a challenge, is a masterclass in tact.The score is a bravura achievement by Michael Kamen, who inventively mutates the old song that gives the film its title.The story is pretty straightforward, even if the telling of it is anything but. The dialogue is peppered with memorable exchanges. There are outstanding set-pieces of comic business.Over and above everything is the imagery. The stuff of dreams, occasionally of nightmares. Helmond's smiling face stretched out to breaking point by Broadbent; De Niro engulfed by flying paper; Holm turned into a speaking pavement; Pryce battling with a faceless giant Samurai; a ghastly dinner at an exploding restaurant; the haunting final shot...BRAZIL is an extraordinary cinematic experience.",Brazil

105,dead47548,A haunting masterpiece.,10,8 January 2008,"A glorious dystopian masterpiece filled to the brim with some of the most remarkable symbolisms ever brought to film. It covers topics from the inefficiency of the government to society's blind obedience of those in authority to the desperate need to fit in. The inefficiency of the government is the most blatant one that has many instances scattered throughout. The most obvious example of this is the fact that a simple mistake in paper work leads to the death of an innocent man, which ignites the fire of the entire film, including the higher-ups scrambling to cover all loose ends of this accidental murder. A simple man tries to correct a mistake, and in turn becomes an enemy of the state who is hunted down throughout the whole film. A more subtle example of this is the role reversal in Kurtzmann's office. We see Sam Lowry, the lowly office worker, sitting behind the desk of the superior, esteemed boss, Kurtzmann. Sam is doing all of the hard work that is expected of the superior worker, while Kurtzmann is sitting idly in a wild state of confused panic. Another example of the government's extreme inefficiency comes in the use of paperwork throughout. The government tries to be more organized and efficient by using paperwork to justify literally everything, but all it really does is make the entire state of the nation more cluttered and disorganized. This is most clearly seen near the end when Tuttle disappears in the massive load of papers that come at him from thin air.Society's blind obedience is seen through the signing of checks and bills. Police officers break into a home, put a bag over a woman's husband and drag him away. Through all of her screaming and crying, they ask her to sign a release form and she does it without even looking at it. This is also seen when all of the workers are following the boss around wherever he goes, begging for his attention and approval. There are several other instances of this relationship between the government and it's people.The desperate need to fit in is seen mainly through the use of cosmetic surgery. People go to these drastic measures to look younger and younger, so much that Ida ends up looking younger than her son and they go through this pain and torture in order to be more accepted. Alma's appearance throughout the film, slowly being more and more bandaged up from complications in the surgery, is an example of this and another example of blind obedience. Her appearance is being completely destroyed and dismantled, but she keeps going back for more surgery because she is obedient to the doctor who tells her that it's all procedure.Another interesting symbolism I noticed was the disturbing paradox of Jack's use of the baby mask. He is a terrible person who does awful things and tortures people, but he uses the image of a child, an image of purity and innocence as a balance to the dreadful acts he performs.Keeping this brief, I'll just mention one last thing. I found it very interesting that in this dystopian era of terror, filled with violence and disturbing images, that men reverted back to what is commonly referred to as the golden days. By golden days, I am referring to the 30s - 40s, mainly seen by the instances of noir in the film. By that I mean the classic films (Casablanca is the only one mentioned specifically) in the office, and the way the workers dress, mainly their hats which are used as a sign of importance, much like the Coens used a few years later in Miller's Crossing. Another example of this noir obsession is simply the name of the man who works next to Sam, Harvey Lime, referencing The Third Man's Harry Lime.The ending was also very haunting and pessimistic, and very similar to 1984's. Cheers to Gilliam for not caving to the studio's demands for a Hollywood ending. Overall, this is one of the deepest films I've ever seen and easily one of the greatest.",Brazil

Gilliam's trademark brand of bone-dry, pitch-black humour makes for some vicious satire, which is only aided by the brilliant production design and mishmash of genres. Indeed, the compaction of the entire 20th century into a single patchwork cultural pastiche, combined with the purposefully vague time and place, hammers down the point that this is not a parodic vision of some futurist dystopia, it's a commentary on our own times. And so it's not really a science fiction work at all, though the fantastical settings and technological advances certainly help. This is a political satire, through and through. And it's one of the best films of all time.",Brazil

His overbearing mother (Kathrine Helmond) acts as the example of misguided parenting that has led many of down a selfish path at the cost of a meaningful life. She can't even see the carnage that accumulates within and outside her self engrossed daily activities through an on-going campaign of terror, supplied by rogue terrorist, Archibald Tuttle (an odd choice and performance by Robert DeNiro).The flash point is revealed within the opening clerical error. A family is literally ripped apart and Sam alter discovers this misdeed, He feels compelled to do the right thing, leading him to the scene of the crime where he sees a girl who seems to be the same girl from Sam's dream. The rest of the movie is Sam's quest to save his fair maiden, and creating his Camelot, his ""happy place"", signified by the clichéd' example from the song ""Brazil"" . The supporting cast is quite strong and drives home each one's myopic view of their role in society, the films' strongest point . The ending is a perfect reminder that we all have a choice.

110,jackasstrange,As perfect as a film can get... A miraculous film.,9,12 February 2014,"Brazil is a film that starts electrifying shining and ends in a sad fading, a mix of dystopian sage, fantasy and a 'future' (looks like a retro-future) where all the system organization is ironically a mess., And of course, with an excellent fitting soundtrack, I mean, it's so good, so good that the film carries the name of the country where the music theme were originated from: 'Brazil'. In times of terrorism and oppression, everything that Lowry, interpreted by Vincent Pryce wants is peace and happiness, a escape from his lone and sad life, and this is ironically when his troubles begins.But is above all a comedy film, a satire about this 'futuristic' system, so don't go watch this film thinking that the tone is serious, because it simply isn't. Is a comedy, even dull at times.So that are my hints. And sure, you'll love this film if you go with the right mood to watch it. There are dull characters doing dull things sometimes(typical of 80s humor) but they are barely noticeable. The story, the visuals are so mesmerizing and...great! I swear, I never saw something like that before. The atmosphere is in fact, what makes this film unique and magic.In the end, you'll find yourself not wanting the film to end.

111,TheHonestCritic,This is one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen in my life. But does that make it good or bad? Check out my review below to find out!,6,21 October 2019,"""Brazil"" (1985), this is definitely one of the top 10 weirdest movies of all-time. In one of my college classes, we were assigned to watch a different genre of movie each week. We would get three choices, and have to pick only one to watch each week and then write a brief analysis about it. One assignment was to watch a science fiction movie, and ""Brazil"" was one of the choices. I forget what the other two films were that we could choose from. But, the biggest reason I chose ""Brazil"" was because I found out that this is Doug Walker's a.k.a. the Nostalgia Critic's favorite movie. He is notorious for being very strict and picky when it comes to movies. When I originally found out that this was his all-time favorite movie, it really sparked my interest. I thought: ""if this is his favorite movie, then it must be good!"" I watched this movie, and then in the end it left me asking: ""what just happened?! What in the world did I just watch?"" The story was jumbled and confusing, and the acting was all over the place in this movie. It's kind of like the layout of a traditional Zack Snyder film (in a bad way). Too many subplots that barely add up, it hardly focuses on the storyline (what little there is), and it goes on for way too long. Hardly anything made sense, and it had as much to do with Brazil as ""The Karate Kid"" (2010) has to do with karate! The acting ranged from standard, to over the top, to just bad. The only good elements are the special effects, the sets/locations and the soundtrack. As far as special effects go, they were actually very well done, and still hold up today. The sets/locations are great, I love the dystopian look of this movie. It feels more like an experience, rather than watching a movie. Finally, the soundtrack is composed nicely and it really sets the tone for the dystopian look and feel of the movie. Sadly, those three elements do not help this movie. Overall, ""Brazil"" is just a very weird and full out of body experience that not many people will like. It's interesting and I am glad I saw it, I just don't think I'll be seeing it again. I give this film a 3 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 6 out of 10 stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Brazil"" is a very marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10. I consider it to be a bad movie, and I can't recommend it. Sorry, Doug Walker a.k.a. Nostalgia Critic, I don't like ""Brazil"". I can understand it being one of someone's favorite films, but being someone's favorite? Really? That's one of the biggest factors in finding out about a person, learning what their favorite movie is, because that tells you a lot about that person. If you like weird movies with hardly any plot in a dystopian world, then ""Brazil"" is the movie for you! This film just doesn't do that much for me. You'd be better off actually traveling to Brazil.",Brazil
112,GeorgeRoots,Whimsical Future Dystopia Done Right.,8,4 September 2014,"There is no doubt that Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", is a quirky, eccentric and thought provoking movie. Borrowing heavy themes from George Orwell's literary classic, ""1984"". Though this film tends to be slightly more surreal in it's execution, the warped settings and very strange but likable characters help bring some kind of functionality to this broken down world. However, for some reason this has became an all time favourite for some people, but I do find this movie to be strangely overrated.I loved the story, and as said earlier it feels like a wonderful homage to ""1984"". People are living under constant government control and surveillance, whilst having their life ruled by incompetent machines. Some fantastic tracking spots are implemented into the crowded government offices, where a bug falls into a machine which results in a fiasco and kicks off Sam Lowry's (Jonathan Pryce) story. But what I am ultimately upset about is that on repeated viewings, I found that the films material felt either to be too stretched out, or the movie ends abruptly when it feels like it just began.But even after saying that there's nothing entirely wrong with the movie, and I do respect Gilliam's defiance to not alter his vision when the production company wanted him to. I loved it and totally understand and respect every accolade given to it, but all in all I wasn't blown away and I can't help but shudder a little when someone suggests it to me. Aside from that, stellar casting and acting really made it all enjoyable for the most part.Final Verdict: A brilliant, creative and thought provoking picture. Extremely over-rated to me, yet very entertaining. I do recommend seeing it at least once, especially if you are a Terry Gilliam fan. 8/10.",Brazil

Terry Gilliam is a fine director, and few are able to transport audiences into unusual worlds as well as he.  The problem is that Brazil is a complete nightmare; that never ends!  Trying to follow the plot is a useless challenge, so it's best just to go with it.  Either you go with it, and you'll find that you enjoyed the WEIRD ride, or you'll puke and want the ride to stop -- that's how I was.  This film drove me bonkers.  As the film gets stranger, Jonathan Pryce's performance just keeps getting more overbearing.  By the end of the film, I felt like I had just witnessed some huge disaster, and that's exactly what I did.AWFUL.",Brazil
114,Quebec_Dragon,The masterpiece of Terry Gilliam's career,10,26 May 2009,"One of my favorites movies of all time with its unforgettable moments and brilliant ending. I remember staring in awe at the end credits when I first saw it. Visionary, dark, dreamlike, romantic, troubling, sarcastic, surreal are some of the adjectives that spontaneously come to mind. It was obviously influenced by 1984 from Georges Orwell but it adds absurd British humor, a wonderful romantic aspect and so many other elements making it a different beast altogether. Visually and technically, it's just extremely strong, original and a delight to behold. It even has a powerful social commentary/message for those so inclined for deeper analysis. Most importantly, beyond everything else, Brazil is one of the stories I found the most relatable, engrossing and touching. The pace can be sometimes be slow but I was never bored. It's like I was absorbed into that other ""world"", it felt a bit like a waking dream. You owe yourself to watch this one preferably late at night with no one to disturb you (or at least someone special who doesn't talk during the movie ;-) The only risk I see here is that you might have read too many great reviews about Brazil and so your expectations would be unrealistically high.

115,mardalsfossen01,Watching this 1st time in 2018,7,6 December 2018,"For anyone who hasn't seen this and is indecisive if he should watch it, here's some info for you: You can tell a lot of effort went into this tragicomedy-romance-dystopian-fantasy-action-Sci-Fi movie..... Yes, you can really call it like that. It's a story about a nice guy working for a big company and just trying to escape it, may it be in real life or in dreams and he literally starts going crazy for love.
Obviously there's so much to watch nowadays and it's frankly impossible keeping up with all the shows, series, independent entertainers etc etc, that watching an older movie like ""Brazil"" (from 1985) for the first time can cost some patience and needs acceptance due to the old special effects and production.
I honestly had a hard time getting into the movie because of it's old fashion. So I read a summary and an extraction from an interview during the South Bank Show of June 1991 of the director of this movie, Terry Gilliam where he briefly talked about his motivation for the plot. And the idea behind the movie made me like it already.
I watched the movie in whole now and I would say, it is a movie worth being known, even if watching it in 2018 can be a test of your patience. It's kind of a messy film with lots of film props lying around in the darker scenes and you just get the 80's vibe of how they thought a future might look like.
Despite my concerns in the beginning, it certainly is a wonderful idea for a movie and realization for it's time.",Brazil
116,austin0731,"Brazil is inventive, interesting and ahead of its time.",9,30 September 2017,"Brazil is inventive, interesting and ahead of its time. Brazil is such a compelling and fresh story even now, 20+ years after its release. In fact in our world today we should pay so much more attention as the world of Brazil is slowly becoming a reality. With a central bureaucratic government focused on paperworks, rules and regulations the reality escaping Sam Lowry truly is a reflection of all of us. First, I must commend the many brilliant performances in Brazil, of course Jonathan Pryce was very good in his role as Sam Lowry. Robert De Niro was solid in the brief moments that he was on screen and Kim Griest was also really great as Jill Layton playing a brilliant foil to Sam Lowry.Brazil tells such a brilliant story of the protagonist: Sam Lowry and his sense of wonder and imagination a dream of a better world than the technology ridden, grey concrete reality. The film captures the sense of concrete confinement perfectly, the architecture of the world was dull and grey, the office rooms were confined and tight. All the while we see these pipelines running within the walls as the film creates a Orwellian world.This movie captures the idea of the everyday struggle of the everyman perfectly and in a way that is fully relatable. Sam Lowry's character is constantly stuck in this irritating cycle of paperwork and needlessly convoluted central government. This to me is very much a daily struggle for people even now. Just think about the mountains of paperwork you need to fill for the many day to day affairs when really this is simply inefficient. Brazil takes this idea a brings it to a whole new level. Brazil also discusses dreams and the idea that only through our imagination are we free and not to be confined by such an overpowering bureaucracy. Magnificently materialized in a shot near the end of the movie where Sam Lowry is in a room towed away by Jill Layton and there were no wires or pipe work buried in the walls. A brilliant shot utilizing symbolism in the most amazing ways. Brazil is truly a thought provoking movie that is sure to be thought provoking and just has so many interpretations. It is such a beautiful and great film that absolutely exceeds its time.",Brazil

I loved his 12 Monkeys and The Zero Theorem and I heard a lot about Brazil being his most obscure and best work ever, a cult classic and I can totally see why now: like any Gilliam movie it doesn't strike you right away, what the movie you are watching is actually about, even by the end you're not sure and have to see this grand spectacle of pure cinema madness again. Fantastic score by Michael Kamen, stunning visuals that will keep your eyes wide open until the end, set pieces, designs, futuristic visions, extraordinary props with a great deal of tubes and wires that piece this wonderful, dark, funny, bureaucracy filled world of his together along with outstanding performances by Jonathan Pryce and many other great actors and hundreds of extras - Terry Gilliam has truly created something much bigger on the inside than it seems on the outside and I cannot wait to get back to Brazil again.",Brazil
118,asifahsankhan,"""A Place in any of the Twentieth Century, Life is mean and grim""",9,12 June 2017,"In the wake of 1984 and with the work of Kafka in mind, the former Monty Pyton Terry Gilliam realises a load of movie Hume black and surprising in dramatic structure as in that view. Rich in Cinefile quotations but above all to find very successful comic and pungent satirical ideas, Brazil is a complex and original, sometimes confused but often brilliant. The ability to Gilliam to build the stage space and resume it as efficiently as possible is still unsurpassed, and his idea was to present the film as a work of the early sixties psychedelic culture is what allows the film to have the charm that has, to the boundless imagination of its director. But it is also what convinced the executives at Universal to keep it long in the drawer, then distributing it in the cut version in the United States.The hero of ""Brazil"" is Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a meek, desperate little man who works at a computer terminal all day. Occasionally he cheats; when the boss isn't looking, he and his fellow workers switch the screens of their computers to reruns of exciting old TV programs. Sam knows his life is drab and lockstep, but he sees no way out of it. His only escape is into his fantasies - into glorious dreams of flying high above all the petty cares of the world, urged on by the vision of a beautiful woman.His everyday life offers no such possibilities. Even the basic mechanisms of life support seem to be failing, and one scene early in the movie has Robert De Niro in a walk-on as an illegal free- lance repairman who defies the state by fixing things. De Niro makes his escape by sliding down long cables to freedom, like Spider-Man. For Sam, there seems to be no escape. The scene of Brazil, Jonathan Pryce offers what is probably the best performance of his career and Robert De Niro is little more than a cameo, however managing to draw their own character as the only true hero of the film, much more important than the dream Sam.All of this is strangely familiar; the outlines of ""Brazil"" are much the same as those of 1984, but the approach is different.Just as George Orwell's 1984 is an alternate vision of the past, present and future, so ""Brazil"" is a variation of Orwell's novel. The movie happens in a time and place that seem vaguely like our own, but with different graphics, hardware and politics. Society is controlled by a monolithic organisation, and citizens lead a life of paranoia and control. Thought police are likely to come crashing through the ceiling and start bashing dissenters. Life is mean and grim.Nominated for an Oscar for Original Screenplay (Gilliam, Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown) and set design (Norman Garwood), as well as music, sound and song.Steven Soderbergh used the name of the protagonist of this film, Sam Lowry, as a pseudonym of his work as a screenwriter for Schizopolis , the film narrative experimental-ism Brazil should certainly something.",Brazil

But nevertheless, and yet, I was bored. I was searching around HBO, Starz, and Showtime only to find nothing. I see titles I've already seen, have no interest in seeing, or looks straight up terrible. But the title Brazil was standing alone, and it was starting in one minute. ONE MINUTE. What I do is fast, but very smart and precise. I record it, I rush to the kitchen to pop some popcorn, get a soda, and then sit down. The movie has started, and the microwave beeping is inaudible because of my surround sound. Forget it, I forgot the whole concept of popcorn-eating. It was clear out of my mind. I was instead watching Brazil, forgetting everything except the movie. The movie. The movie started, paced itself, then ended. By the end of it, my jaw was wide open...REVIEW: Brazil was fantastic. I've never seen such a film that can endure such bizarre-ness but also keeps in mind it's heart + soul. It was strange, yes, and I kept asking myself in the beginning what exactly WAS this film? But nevertheless, yes, I was loving every bit of it. It contained everything a movie should contain, and contained something that no movie has ever dared to touch.. The acting was good. I shouldn't say so much of it, as it didn't even come clear to me that they were acting. Why? Well the movie didn't even hit me AS a movie. It hit me as an experience. As I was just watching my dreams. Is that really what it was? Huh. The movie itself was just brilliant. I suspected nothing of it, and my 'expectations' were blown through the roof. I was amazed as what I was watching/experiencing. But the thing that irks me is that the film's strangeness WILL set off viewers. I'm glad the movie isn't as mainstream as films like Transformers because I could already see the bad reviews coming in. The movie contains something that mainstream viewers are most likely blinded to, but what could it be? I surely don't know and I surely don't care, because I should have nothing to fear. The movie is brilliant full circle, and no trolls are hear to disrupt it.. The ending hit me. The beginning confused me, the middle transfixed me, and the ending had hit me. It hit me like I have been punched. But instead of being punched by a mean biker man, I have punched by brilliance. Yep, I have said it. I have been punched by brilliance, really, really, VERY hardly. It felt amazing. This movie.. was amazing.Can you withstand it's bizarre, surreal atmosphere? The fact it's a humorous somewhat satirical view of our government? Brazil balls up the ideas of humor, heart, soul, social commentary, brains, action/sci-fi, and bizarre-ness to make a fantastic film that will stay with you days after.

120,antagonist117,The view from Information Adjustments,9,20 November 2014,"As a former executive in Information Adjustments, I feel it is my inescapable duty to record, in signed and stamped triplicate, the errors made in Terry Gilliam's fictional movie ""Brazil."" First, Mister Gilliam's laughable assertion that a maintenance team cannot make repairs to malfunctioning air conditioning unit without form 27B/6. As anyone knows who has had their ducts cleaned, the required form is HZ/7B. But I forgive this creative license, because after all, Mister Gilliam's movie is a fantasy; why, he depicts Harry Tuttle, freelance repairman, as an actual person, when everyone knows that rogues like him are just fairy stories invented to scare children. More serious is the erroneous depiction of the elevator shafts in Information Retrieval. I have never been, of course, but I have it on good authority from a friend who has his very own number on his very own door in that very building that the shaft to the right of the reception desk does not stop at the fourth basement level. The elevator bank to the right, however, does. It is details like that that really take me out of a story, and I expect better of Mister Gilliam. After all, he recreates perfectly the look of things around here, from the one- seater cars to the art deco skyscrapers to the film noir fedoras and shadowing. We wouldn't get much done in Information Adjustments without our fedoras, our classic movies on closed-circuit TV, and our pop art on the walls. Without those, the office would just be row after row of absurdly magnified computer screens and perforated, continuous-feed printers, and that's no world I want to live in! At any rate, I also appreciated the festive cheer and very English humor that Mister Gilliam brought to the proceedings. It always puts a smile on my face to see our Nazi stormtrooper security team singing Christmas carols, and to overhear the friendly small talk that they make while hauling a truckload of blindfolded, strung-up terrorists in for interrogations that will be duly and meticulously transcribed, screams and all. That sort of jocularity is classically Gilliam, as are the movie's thrilling dream sequences. I particularly enjoyed the giant, robotic Japanese warrior: is there any country that better symbolizes endless, neon urbanity, bureaucratic perfection, and always-on consumer electronics that manage our every move than Japan? Except, of course, for our own beautiful city as depicted in ""Brazil."" Speaking of which, I don't quite know what Brazil is supposed to symbolize in Mister Gilliams's movie. Something about trees and utopia, I think; to tell the truth, I rather tuned out toward the end of the film, which is a bit too long and contains a lot of shouting and shooting in the run-up to the credits. The romantic element didn't make a lot of sense to me, either: aren't we supposed to fill out form 78-9/C before beginning an intimate relationship? Only in a movie could lovers be so quick to jump into bed together!For tomorrow's movie in Information Adjustments, I think I'll suggest ""Modern Times"" (1936), ""Blade Runner"" (1982), or ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" (1994): they share some of the themes and visuals of ""Brazil,"" but keep things much more down-to-earth.",Brazil
121,Gresh854,A Dystopian Treasure,8,25 January 2019,"Brazil is a zanily savage, innovative journey-undeniably inspired by the prospects of George Orwell's masterpiece, 1984-that operates as a satirical interpretation of a hereafter society ruled under a totalitarian government. Terry Gilliam is able to employ his peerless creativity and cinematically wacky potential to craft a feasible, yet, illusive universe through wields of some of the most lucid movie sets, costumes, and props ever put to film.Brazil is a psychologically kittenish piece of dystopian revulsion that ultimately serves as a latitude of honor to the art of science-fiction spectacle, even if it's summative of plot-lines feel incoherently choppy and spontaneous at times. (Verdict: B+)",Brazil
122,FairlyAnonymous,Great premise and setup is partially ruined by a lack of direction and purpose,7,24 May 2018,"Brazil is one of those movies that I really want to love. The cinematography is fun, the acting is almost always spot-on, the humour never falls flat, the world is complex and fully-realized... and yet... it seems to forget why the movie exists.I'm writing this review assuming that you have already watched the movie and in this review I will be discussing spoilers and plot-points that could have been tweaked to help fix the movie.Now I must give credit where credit is due: The world of Brazil is amazing. Every aspect of the world is hilarious and bizarre, but it all makes sense. It is a world where bureaucracy and paperwork is more important than having a soul and getting a job done correctly. Everyone is nervous and anxious to move outside of the borders of their role because it could create a domino effect that might ruin the whole of society (or so people seem to believe). Trying to fix your heating unit? You better have the paperwork and the authority to do so or it might mean trouble.What makes this future even better is that no one seems to be inherently evil. Malicious? Maybe, but definitely not ""evil"". It is simply run by a bunch of buffoons and people who think that if they stick to code and order that everything will turn out hunky-dory. The cops who kidnap people from their homes? They don't feel guilt because they were following paperwork. The man who tortures people for information? Not his fault if someone innocent dies because he was well within the parameters of the paperwork that was given to him. The bureaucratic future has very clever satire and, rather unfortunately, predicting elements of the future quite well.
But what about the plot?Brazil starts off very strong, but I can say that there is consistently a point in the movie where I always mentally clock-out and start to lose interest:The relationship with Jill. She isn't handled well in this movie... at all.
Jill is a young woman who is trying to help her neighbor who has suffered at the hands of bureaucracy. With what little we know about her, we at least know that she is determined to try and make things right and seems a bit fed-up with how everything works. This makes her seemingly the polar opposite of Sam. She is rough and he is soft. Sam is a bureaucrat who claims to like his current job and that he has no other dreams or ambitions in the world. However, in his dreams, we see that he is longing for an escape and he believes that love is the only way out. This loneliness and desperation for escape leads him to fall in love with the picture of a woman whom he has never met and chase after her consistently with very unrealistic expectations. In short, he expects her to save him emotionally, while he tries to save her from the injustice of the bureaucracy, and deep down inside he also wishes that the bureaucracy would be destroyed.This is a really good set-up: A hopeless romantic trying to fall in love with someone due to his desperation of wanting to leave bureaucracy. This isn't love. This is him putting expectations onto someone and hoping that it turns out the way he has it imagined in his head. For this to be interesting she can't fall in love with him. Jill needs to not meet up to his expectations, so as to show just how unrealistic and crazy Sam is becoming (which would fit into the ending of the movie).When Sam first enters the truck with Jill there is immediately a clash between the two. Jill thinks he is some random creep who is following her (which he is) and Sam expects her to save him from bureaucracy. He starts telling her to do all of these crazy things to meet his expectations of who she is and to fulfill his dream of screwing over the bureaucracy. And yet, for some reason... she does fall in love with him. A funnier and more interesting version of this movie could've had Sam consistently chasing her down where he gradually becomes more and more insane due to his desperation intensifying, and in the end she would still die the same way, but this time it would fit more with the theme of the movie because it would be his want for escape that leads to the death of his escape. The final minutes of the film have Sam believing that he has ran-off with Jill, when in reality she is dead. To me, this ending would have a bit more sting to it if Jill never really loved him because it (once again) would show that Sam's imagination does not reflect reality. He wants an escape with a lover who doesn't love him, and even after his escape is dead he will still imagine that there is a way out.Further issues with Jill's character is that she seems to lose all sense of character after she falls in love with Sam. What happened to Jill fighting the injustices that befell her neighbor? What happened to the rough and tough character? By the end of the movie she simply becomes the thing that Sam wanted her to be, which, AGAIN, doesn't fit with the themeing of the movie. She lives up to all of his expectations when Sam's expectations are SUPPOSED TO BE UNREALISTIC. This single-handedly destroys a big chunk of the movie, and to make matters even worse, their chemistry feels very forced and is boring. Everything in the movie is more interesting than their relationship and yet it is the focus of the story!
All in all, Brazil has a very interesting set-up and world, but it has poor pay-off and seems to leave a lot of loose-ends hanging about. The ending itself doesn't bother me, but what leads up to the ending does. Obviously, there are more issues with the movie than what I wrote, but I think what put the most strain on my attention span was a lack of focus and a boring relationship that didn't seem to fit into what was being set-up.",Brazil
123,dobbin-4,A bureaucratic nightmare and a visual masterpiece,8,2 June 2020,"A fantastic visual spectacle as you'd expect from Terry Gilliam.

124,MrPupkin,Brazil offers a chillingly hilarious vision of the near-future.,9,2 February 2020,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is a highly engaging black comedy that uses a dystopian society as its backdrop, and puts a unique twist on the genre, and through Gilliam's camera lens, it's a truly bizarre and memorable vision. The dystopian genre is very interesting, and it's one that is always exciting to see what they'll come up with it. With Brazil you have something totally different, you have hints of humor thrown into the film's storyline, and it adds something to the enjoyment of the film. Dystopian society films are often dark, nightmarish portraits of a society, but with this film we get something very different. The formula here has been reworked to give the storyline a bit more range than your standard dystopian film, and in turn it makes for a truly engaging experience. In the hands of Terry Gilliam, you have a well crafted picture with some truly stellar performances from its cast, especially from lead actor Jonathan Pryce who lights up every scene that he's in. Brazil is a great film, one that succeeds at delivering a different take on your standard dystopian society film, and in the hands of Terry Gilliam, he crafts a standout picture that is sure to please genre fans looking for something a bit different. Brazil is eccentric in the way that it's told, and it makes for a truly entertaining two and a half hours. If you enjoy Gilliam's work, you're sure to enjoy this. What makes Brazil great is the fact that it has your standard dark, atmospheric elements than are synonymous with the genre, but there are also lighter touches comic relief to really make it stand out among other films. Brazil is great filmmaking and one of the finest dystopian society films I've seen. With a great mix of comedy and serious content, Brazil is a standout genre film that elevates the bar and makes for a truly worthwhile viewing experience.",Brazil

126,son_of_cheese_messiah,A very British fascism,9,11 June 2011,"A year after 1984, Gilliam produced not only his finest work but the finest work inspired by Orwell, and something which Orwell himself would have warmly applauded. Gilliam gets it. This is a very British fascism, bureaucratic, conformist, ludicrous yet sinister and one only has to look out on Britain 25 years later to see, with horror, this potential being realised. An excellent script, full of sly wit, and a succession of powerful images make this a masterpiece. In this world a sweet dream and a nightmare are two sides of the same coin, and one is likely to morph into the other at a moment's notice. The cast, with one exception, is universally excellent. This film would be perfect if it were not for Jonathon Price's love interest, a character neither well conceived nor well performed. Although it is difficult to fathom the workings of the human heart, it is hard to believe that Price (or any man) is going to go gaga over a tomboyish, charmless, belligerent truck driver who smokes a cigarette like Lil from the old Andy Cap cartoon. No doubt they wanted to make her the arch-non-conformist in every way, but they left sex appeal out of the mix.",Brazil
127,peeedeee-94281,Giving It a 5 mainly for the visuals and some scenes,5,28 April 2019,"This movie has been touted as a classic over the years, but after watching it recently (I think I watched it a couple of decades ago), I don't think it really holds up. The main problem with the film is that it feels like it's going somewhere, but ultimately it doesn't. It just comes to a dead-end, and that's it, roll credits.
There are a lot of quirky characters and quirky scenes that feel like little comedy skits on their own, and can be amusing. But the movie as a whole just doesn't work. The Orwellian dystopian society is, well, too much like 1984. Why didn't it just get named 'Gilliam's 1984'? I'm not saying the plot line exactly falls in line with George Orwell's story, but it feels like it was set in the same universe.
And the silly parallel fantasy sequences just don't quite work. They're way too over the top, and don't really have any explanation as to why Sam is imagining himself as a winged savior. I get it, his life is mundane, but ultimately his motivations for doing ANYTHING in this movie feels forced and is only there to keep the plot moving forward. The same with Jill. She goes from despising the guy to being in love with him, without any reason or rationale. At first I thought it was to use him to get into his workplace, but that wasn't the case at all.
Overall, this is definitely not one of Gilliam's best, which is a shame with the imagination and talent, both his and the actors, that were at his disposal.",Brazil
128,gogoschka-1,Perhaps the most imaginative and entertaining nightmare ever put on film,10,11 November 2015,"A virtual celebration of writer/director Terry Gilliam's singular creative vision and seemingly limitless imagination, Brazil is a unique movie experience. And it is kind of hard to put the label of any one particular genre on the film; it's generally referred to as ""dystopian science fiction"" (which certainly isn't wrong), but it's also a satire, a drama, a black comedy and perhaps even a fantasy film. Like many other dystopian sci-fi films (e.g. Fahrenheit 451, Equilibrium, The Hunger Games), Brazil depicts a totalitarian society, but that's about as far as the similarities with other films go.The whole design of Brazil's crazy world is unlike anything I've ever seen in other movies (with the exception perhaps of those made by the same filmmaker). Where films with similar themes typically go for a futuristic look that is defined by all the technological advancements the writers and filmmakers can dream of, Terry Gilliam chooses the complete opposite direction. In his film, technology seems to have made no progress since somewhere around the forties or fifties, and what technology there is doesn't exactly look very reliable. And unlike other dystopian films, it's not primarily the bleak aspects of a totalitarian society Gilliam wants to explore; in his film, he wants to show how hilariously insane, inept and ridiculous many of the mechanisms and instruments of oppression truly are. In that sense, Brazil is mainly a satire (at least that's how I perceive it), and it is often either darkly funny or downright hilarious.There is simply not a dull moment in the film: it's a wild ride that never lets up and almost every image on the screen practically bursts with clever (often hilarious) details; from the way food is served in restaurants to how the benefits of plastic surgery are presented, Gilliam's imagination can only be marveled at. His vision of a bureaucracy gone mad is probably the most entertaining nightmare ever put on film (I'm talking about the director's cut, of course). A masterpiece that gets even better after repeat viewings: 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",Brazil
129,erwan_ticheler,Compelling film that stays in the mind,9,17 July 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSIt's hard to talk about this film.It is a very strange,almost psychedelic experience.It shifts very brilliantly between dream and reality,but even the reality looks like a dream.It is clearly based on the dreamy city in Fritz Lang's science fiction classic METROPOLIS and the same futuristic world of BLADE RUNNER. But it is better than those two because of the surprising plot twists(from which the final climax is mind blowing)and the superb acting.This film has got one of the finest casts ever with first class actors like Jonathan Price,Robert De Niro(a small but unforgettable role),Ian Holm,Jim Broadbent,Michael Palin and Bob Hoskins.Yes,this is science fiction of the highest order.Terry Gilliam's great directing abilities are obvious.Just like in his other science fiction fantasy film TWELVE MONKEYS he uses strange close ups,but the shifts between the dream world and reality are simply brilliant.Sometimes it's hard to know whether it's a dream or not but that makes it even more enjoyable.The strange camera angles complete the all out strangeness of this film.It is also a film that criticizes the modern society in which everything is based on performances and quantity,not so much quality.That's also a comparison with METROPOLIS only in BRAZIL it is much better worked out.Although it is a long film it doesn't bore for one second and all the scenes are full of surprises,visual effects that are great and weird characters.All in all quite a brilliant cinematic achievement that is slightly underestimated(BLADE RUNNER and STAR WARS are given much more attention)but fortunately not forgotten.It needs to be seen to be believed!  9/10 (currently number 64 in my all time top 100 list)
PS: I must say that the fight between Sam(Jonathan Price)and the giant robot and the climax of that fight is a copy of the dreamy fight in the cave between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader on planet Dagobah in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.",Brazil
130,Artimidor,Dystopic retro-future with a message: Tomorrow was another day,10,24 December 2011,"Despite shot in 1985 this is definitely a 1984 film. But you probably know that already. Actually - to be precise - it's quite a timeless movie well worth watching a century later as well, as it aims to mix things from past, present and future, or you might even call it an alternate reality piece - as according to the first shot this film takes place ""somewhere in the 20th century""... And thus it might be closer to reality than you initially thought! Be it as it may: The look of the strange retro-future world we're allowed to discover in ""Brazil"" is truly something else. Gilliam's dystopic vision combines dead serious elements from Orwell and Kafka and lets it all clash with a heavy dose of Monty Python humor, sometimes satirical, sometimes anarchically absurd, deep black or just outright laugh out loud slapstick. The story at times might surprise you, irritate you, make you laugh, dream, root for Sam Lowry, then again it also does shock and terrify, it lets you think and re-think. ""Brazil"" has depth, is allegorical and complex, and could therefore have too much of an impact on first viewing for its own good - or it perhaps touches you not at all if you're not into cerebral stuff. If you like a challenge, this one's a treat - just make sure to watch the Director's cut and not the butchered version released for syndicated television, which is a travesty of the movie's original intent.",Brazil
131,kurosawakira,"""My Complication Had a Little Complication""",6,19 October 2014,"It's never a reader-friendly opening sentence that states that the writer doesn't generally enjoy the films of the director in question, in this instance, of Terry Gilliam's. ""Twelve Monkeys"" (1995) I like, but have found most others impenetrable despite the obvious craftsmanship.Although this impenetrability does in part apply to ""Brazil"" (1985), as well, it is so many great things at once it's quite impossible not to be swept away but it: ""Brazil"" is sardonic, retro-futuristic, dystopian in its black and dead-pan humour, Kafkaesque even, a world that by its design describes its narrative as in ""Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari"" (1920), here a mishmash of objects and trash in a society apparently governed by many laws that in their complexity are supposed to make the world a series of lucidly automated operations — and last but not least Jonathan Price in one of the most iconic roles of the eighties.For me the closest point of comparison is not Monty Python but Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" (1982), both arising from the bleak prophecy of not future but present societies governed by endless corporate bureaucratic machineries. The main difference, however, is in how the universe is constructed: while in ""Blade Runner"" the universe is nihilistically silent, letting the world destroy itself on its own, here the universe winks behind our back. It is, like much of Gilliam's filmography, a journey into time and space, governed by the rules of paranoia and not exactly knowing one's footing in the universe that seems to be constantly shifting an changing.Another point of reference is in the release history of the film, which could be from the film's askew universe itself. Deemed too bleak and confusing by the distributor, Universal, it was cut down drastically to 90 minutes, yet Gilliam fought so that the film was shown in secret and without Universal's blessing, and its reputation skyrocketed when the Los Angeles Critics Association awarded it with best picture and best director among others, even at a time when the film had not been seen by the public.",Brazil
132,mgruebel,The best dystopic comedy,9,25 December 2013,"Some dystopic movies take themselves too seriously. ""1984,"" which came out around the same time, is a good example. In Brazil, the unique comedic touch of Terry Gilliam pulls off the almost impossible, a film that is dystopic, comedic, and wistful all at the same time.Its hero is just an ordinary guy caught in the ever-churning cogs of bureaucratic incompetence. There are no confrontations with the ""Great Leader"" here, just a quest for love, and much symbol-heavy daydreaming that eventually trades places with the protagonist's dreary reality.The film is filled with priceless set pieces, such as newspaper pages sticking to a person, who then magically evaporates; a mother of our hero who grows every younger thanks to plastic surgery, while her friend attempting the same rejuvenation turns into jelly. And of course, Robert De Niro's priceless appearance as a freelance plumber willing to mix up the pipes.Ah yes, pipes. The film is replete with them, symbolizing perhaps the contorted entrails of advanced government bureaucracy which eventually collapses due to paperwork constipation. Or perhaps the hero's confusion. Or... one can easily come up with another half dozen valid interpretations. The rest of the art design is equally well done, from the retro Fresnel screens to the junky armored vehicle. Gilliam uses such devices in many of his films (the video ball in Twelve Monkeys comes to mind), but nowhere better than here.Films like Time Bandits and Brazil establish Gilliam as an auteur with a unique touch in the realm that blends fantasy, dystopia and comedy into masterpieces. Maybe I should have given it a ""10,"" but the story occasionally wanders a bit more than necessary, especially when you have seen the film many times like I have, so I'll stick to a near-perfect score. In the realm of dark comedy, Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" is still better.",Brazil
133,dkncd,The future is bureaucratic,10,27 September 2007,"""Brazil"" is set in a dystopian future, where society is closely monitored and its freedoms infringed upon by the Ministry of Information. The film opts for a humorous approach to the dystopia genre, which isn't surprising given that the film is directed and co-written by Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame. The film is the story of Sam Lowry, who has a dull life working for the Ministry of Information until it changes through a strange chain of events. The Ministry of Information is no doubt inspired by the Ministry of Truth from George Orwell's book ""1984"", but this film goes to extra lengths to show its ministry as an unwieldy bureaucratic nightmare.The sets, costumes and props in ""Brazil"" create a dazzling and interesting world to see. The film features colourful and fantastic dream sequences which provide an escape from Sam's dull life. Michael Kamen's score is also an effective addition to the atmosphere of this film.Jonathan Pryce leads the cast as Sam Lowry and creates a memorable comical lackey. Kim Greist also delivers an excellent performance as Jill Layton, the woman literally of Sam's dreams. The supporting cast includes notable performances from Robert De Niro as an ever resourceful heroic repairman, Ian Holm as a trepid bureaucrat, Bob Hoskins as a vindictive serviceman and Michael Palin as Sam's old friend Jack.The story develops a number of interesting threads and moves with eccentric humor. The film's ending seemed bizarre at first, but in the end proved brilliant. ""Brazil"" manages to make a bleak and bureaucratic future highly amusing.",Brazil
134,Ozzy2000,Powerful Art-house Masterpiece,10,26 March 2008,"Terry Gilliam's classic art-house masterpiece set in the Dystopian Retro-futuristic society dominated by a Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Sam Lowry (Jonathon Price) is a senior officer in the information ministry who discovers a mistake has been made on a utility bill for a poverty stricken family whose father was arrested in a swat squad raid for the unpaid debt. When Sam Lowry personally wants to refund the trivial amount he discovers a grief stricken family in the slums and accidentally confronts a female insurgent terrorist Jill Layton (Kim Griest) who is fighting the system. In a huge twist Sam finds himself in love with Jill and in touch with the injustices of the system he protects and decides to turn. Sam accepts a senior intelligence position through his powerful Mother who has huge influence in Government. Sam's surrealistic dreams of a monstrous urban city rising up against his soring and angelic love for Jill and what she stands for is magnificent in its graphic depiction. Archibald ""Harry"" Tuttle (Robert De Niro) comes to Sam's aid as he committed a deepening subterfuge against his ruling elite by utilising his powerful position and influence. A very beautiful and moving film with stunningly beautiful art direction in the pre-CGI days. It draws parallels with the Orwellian classic ""1984"" and should imbue the audience with an important message of the current existence of a depersonalised and self-interested crushing Government bureaucracy and corporate state. I have always admired Terry Gilliam's ability to interweave an intense and moving love story into the transformational character arc between the leading actors with great emotional depth. Again he presents us with masterpiece film that was not a great box office success but will stand out in Film history long after most films have dissolved into oblivion. The film's messages about the human condition are finely balanced with the darker comedy. One of my personal favorites.",Brazil
135,pontifikator,Gilliam's best film,7,29 June 2011,"This is, in my very humble opinion, Terry Gilliam's best film, but still it falls short of the mark. I really liked the film as it exists in Gilliam's cut (there are two other edits released, and his is 142 minutes long).The story is compelling, but Gilliam, as is so often the case, gets bogged down in special effects that add nothing to the story. The fantasy scenes of our hero (Sam Lowry played by Jonathon Pryce) are very effective, giving us insight into Lowry's character. But the loss of Harry Tuttle in the paper creates confusion, and the samurai doesn't tell us anything we don't already know.In spite of its shortcomings, I really liked the film. When it's intentionally bogged down in bureaucracy, it's both telling and funny. There are great comments on the superficiality of society and the dangers of trusting the bureaucracy. Although I don't call it a success, it does not fail (as ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" does).",Brazil

137,thedarkhorizon,Neo noir dystopian science fiction fantasy with UNIQUE vision.,8,3 January 2020,"(This review might not be informative or helpful... it's just my notes after watching it)Wonderfully bizarre. I am happy I watched it this new years eve again after 6 years - and this time I was way more able to appreciate it.Gilliam is just a genius, with every film I think that - again. 12 Monkeys was a blast, and so was this George Orwell 1984, sci-fi, retro-punk, dystopian masterpiece. It is astonishingly complex and very well designed - I can see a lot of similarities to THE ZERO THEOREM and 12 MONKEYS here, using retro-technology and cold, geometric (vs. exotic and opulent-colorful) backdrops to tell a highly dark, dystopian story... dealing with society, the human worldview... and in the case of Brazil, with a very in-effective, coldblooded system to keep society ruled by a 'powerful' government. The in-efficiency is very well shown by many details (my favorite: ill-working machines and those ugly tubes hanging out randomly from ceilings... everywhere!).
I loved the cinematography as well, with many wide-angle shots up close and dynamic pans... it makes one feel IN the story, IN the system, IN the society. Trapped, claustrophobic.
I love how Gilliam paints in the humor and imagination... into a surreal, grotesque and dark world. This film is dark and light, sad and happy, critical and funny at the same time.All scenes and images are sublime. Rich with details, symbols and a context make this film so wonderful to look at... in fact, to truly understand all the hints, details and easter eggs one has to look at it more than once (I rewatched it one day later again...). The posters, the machines, the costumes, the sets. It sets the bar high for any other dystopian neo noir film to come.Gilliam... who fights again and again against the movie industry to get his movies funded... movies with incredible impact and a still modern commentary onto politics, society or any other human 'problem'... I am so thankful he never gave up.All I can say: go watch it and see for yourself. Even if you do not like it in the end... there will be at least ONE image, one line, one character, one scene... just one detail that sticks with you for long time after.",Brazil

For me, it started out really strongly as a black humor film about a bureaucratic dystopian world, but then kind of went into action set pieces that I thought were kind of out of place. The strongest part of the film for me, is the first act of the film and just getting to know this kind of 1984-ish dystopian world where everything is paperwork and is filled with machines that don't work. I appreciated the dream sequences and Jonathan Pryce's performance, but overall I also thought the movie was too long and I kind of checked out after the 100 minute mark or so.

140,lucasversantvoort,Classic piece of dystopian satire,8,5 May 2015,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil (named after the 1939 song, ""Aquarela do Brasil"") fits into the type of film that satirizes futuristic, dystopian societies. The two things keeping it apart from similar films are its humorous screenplay and, most impressively, its set-design.The year issomething, in the town of.somewhere. The film never explains when and where we are and perhaps that's the point. The cities of the future could look radically different than how we view them today, perhaps unrecognizably so. Perhaps Brazil is named after a city in real-life Brazil except without its characteristic nature and beaches, etc. We see Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a bureaucrat living the only way possible for a bureaucrat in a film, bored. His mother (Katherine Helmond) spends almost all her time at the plastic surgeon; her mother's friend tries to hook him up with her daughter; his boss (Ian Holm) depends on him for the most simple of tasks. In short: a rather restricting life. He dreams, however, of flying through the clouds and trying to rescue a damsel in distress (Kim Greist). These dreams, he keeps to himself. When trying to rectify a bureaucratic error, the cause of which is hilarious, he sees the woman of his dreams and spends most of the film trying to find her, while also simultaneously finding himself in all sorts of bureaucratic trouble.Without a doubt, the real joys of Brazil are to be found in the many ways both the screenplay and set-design satirize the dystopian society. These are the things which made me wish the film never ended, not the main plot which grew rather uninteresting for me towards the end. Consider a scene where Sam, his mother and some friends are eating in a restaurant. One of them orders something along the lines of meat. When it arrives, however, it turns out to be a soft lump of something, thus ridiculing in a 2001 kind of way how the food of the future will look (and taste) like. Moments later, a bomb explodes. While people are bleeding in the background and fires are being extinguished, Sam and company calmly proceed to talk as if nothing happened. There are numerous of these kinds of satirical highlights which I'll leave for you to discover.There are a couple of issues with Brazil, one of which is its consistency in tone. It's an issue I also had with Gilliam's The Fisher King which went from funny to incredibly melodramatic when Robin Williams' character's traumatic history was revealed. Because much of the film was humorous in nature, I found the dramatic scenes were more difficult to take seriously. In Brazil, it's the scene featuring a certain widow which stands out as the dramatic highlight. Gilliam knows how to generate pathos, but the satirical nature of both films reduce the effectiveness somewhat.A review of Brazil simply cannot exclude a mention of the film's troubled history which is a famous story. To keep it short: director Gilliam fought against Universal's Sid Sheinberg who kept the film from being released to make a different cut, the so-called ""Love Conquers All"" version (can't imagine how that would end...). Gilliam threatened to burn the negative and appeared with one of the film's actors, Robert de Niro, on the Today show. He eventually arranged for private screenings in Los Angeles for the LA Film Critics Assocation, who awarded it Best Picture, Director and Screenplay after which Sheinberg, embarrassed, was forced to release the film anyway. What makes this background story interesting are the parallels between Sheinberg's actions and the very point Gilliam was trying to make with Brazil (i.e. bureaucratic meddling, etc.). It lends an incredible irony that is both funny and frightening.In the end, Brazil has earned its place in the Hall of Fame of satire with its hilarious, though flawed, script and fantastic art-direction. See this film—not for the main plot—but for the endlessly creative satire.",Brazil

143,K-Slicer,Paperwork Sucks!,10,8 October 2002,"That is the mentality driving Johnathon Pryce in the film ""Brazil"".  To escape the messed-up existence he calls life, he daydreams about a girl he must save from characters that look like extras from an Akira Kurosawa film. As he meanders the city he lives in and the inefficient bureaucracy that controls the land to correct an administrative error, he starts to lose his grip on reality.  The story twists a few times and it comes to an ending that will leave you staring at your TV screen for the next 120 minutes. Terry Gilliam, the masterful director of all the Monty Python films, writes a very offbeat and complex homage to the great author George Orwell with ""Brazil"".  The dank and dirty environment that is the setting for ""Brazil"" sets the tone for the film.  There are many satirical references made to bureaucracy, religion, and society in general as the film moves forward. One of the best aspects in the story is the fight between the government and the rebels.  Bob Hoskins does very well as a slimy repairman while Robert DeNiro turns in a surprising part as the rebel repairman who does a good job.  The best performance of film goes to Johnathon Pryce as the records handler who slowly comes to realize that not everything is as it seems. Overall, this is the best film I have ever seen on the subject where a society is like the one in ""1984"".  I don't think it is any surprise that ""Brazil"" came out in 1985.  With a multi-layered mess-with-your-head story, a great cast of goofy but very dark and dank characters, and very acidic satire on many of our beloved institutions, ""Brazil"" is definitely a classic!  I give it a 10 out of 10!PS:  This is Terry Gilliam's best film!",Brazil
144,Ziglet_mir,Gilliam's Masterpiece,10,14 February 2011,"This is cinematic genius. A chrome samurai fighting a winged warrior? A kiss so climactic it nails your nerves to the wall while at the same time being caught off guard by the hysterical one-liner that precedes it? Monoliths shaking the earth as they rise? Sequences so dream- like I feel like I have dreamed them before?Terry Gilliam is a true genius of originality, art, and imagination. I do not care what haters have to say. All I know is that I am more than stunned every time I watch Brazil.The intense contrast between reality and Sam's imagination is beautifully portrayed. We are constantly in and out of Sam's deepest dreams and desires as Gilliam conducts his creative symphony to staggering heights. Eventually, it reaches one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, while we are also left guessing and never once predicting right.Jonathon Pryce, Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Ian Holm, Katherin Helmond, Ian Richardson, Peter Vaughan, and Bob Hoskins are nothing below awesome as they add superb elements to Gilliam's bizarrely crafted world. Pryce follows his bliss, while Greist plays the cute, but tough love interest of Sam's craziest dreams. Robert De Niro plays a small but important role that is both fresh and different, while Michael Palin's performance is seriously terrifying. Simply, there is never going to be another world nor film, like Brazil. It is in a category all on its own and rightfully so. It is filled with memorable scenes and amazing camera shots, while Michael Kamen's original score is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a film. Brazil is Gilliam's masterpiece.",Brazil

146,rebecca-ry,Strangely I left this film with a smile on my face.... (spoilers),9,22 January 2012,"I only recently watched Brazil and feel terribly guilty about having left it so long. I am a huge fan of Terry Gilliam's work and was extremely pleased with this film. It starts off with the fatal mis-print and neatly flows on to show what is caused by this minor malfunction. When seeing Mr. Buttle being dragged away from his family it instantly shocks you and sets a dark tone for the film. This tone is continued through-out the film particularly with characters such as Michael Palin's Jack Lint who's friendly exterior slowly becomes more and more sinister. Also, in scenes where characters such as Jill are attempting to file complaints with the 'Government' and are told they have to fill out forms or go to other departments, the feeling of hopelessness is sensed from the beginning. However, Harry Tuttle, played by Robert De Niro provides a comic relief to the films' dark atmosphere by occasionally jumping in and saving the miniature disasters in Sam's life and quickly flying out again. The film overall was excellent. In the chase scene at the end you find yourself really hoping Sam makes it and (SPOILER IS COMING) despite the final chase scene being bizarre and un-realistic, you just accept it as being Terry's trademark and do not even think for a second that this is all in poor Sam's imagination. The final blow when Jack Lint's face peers at the screen in front of the beautiful valley genuinely makes your heart sink but then you get the after-feeling of realising how great the ending is. At some points the film can become quite manic and confusing, particularly towards the end and even at the beginning of the film people can struggle understanding what's going on. However, everything is well explained sooner or later in the film and all loose ends are tied up in the end with some being left for dramatic effect.I'm so thankful Terry Gilliam fought for this film, to think the studio wanted a 'Hollywood ending' for Brazil is awful because despite you wanting Sam to live 'happily ever after', the real ending to this film is better than anyone could have thought of. The failed attempt of commercialising this film is a great back story for the film because although in Brazil the little man fails, Brazil is a prime example of the 'little man' succeeding!",Brazil

148,CherryBlossomBoy,People dressed in garbage filmed with an idiot-camera,2,23 March 2011,"Interestingly how a bad day at work can compromise even a cult name in movie business. Terry Gilliam clearly had a lot of bad days while filming Brazil.Can everyone's cult-favorite (and a man who also made wonderful contributions to ""Monty Python"" opus) go wrong? Let me answer this way: Gilliam as a director is cunning, witty, absurd and insane - and it all shows in ""Twelve Monkeys""!But not here. Maybe I should have watched ""Brazil"" in 1985. when I was eleven. I probably would have liked it. It would also have been something I've never seen before. Now, in 2009. nothing seems novel, but a lot seems dated or cheap or dysfunctional. Great hype this movie has is also a handicap.Gilliam's otherwise masterful use of wide lenses (a hazard for most directors) doesn't work here. It does give the movie a unique look and enhances grotesque atmosphere alright, but it also makes scenery (especially interiors) grotesquely big and the action, wherever there's any, is lost in space. It also reveals bad training and bad choreography of actors and extras. Instead of a movie we get an amateur stage show. It also affected the pace. Everything is just disjointed, as if in the end the director didn't have energy to put it together right. The cinematography is too clean and crisp. I don't know if this was to serve any kind of purpose but the movie would benefit from more rugged picture as seen in ""Crimson Permanent Assurance"". Set design looks cheap despite being highly detailed. I never got past the obviousness of scale models. Protagonists are wearing complex ""equipment"" that should be a node to steam-punk, but it looks like garbage and neither director nor the actors had the imagination to convince us otherwise. Cast is mostly wrong. De Niro is wasted, Pryce should never ever be a lead and Palin is always just Palin, whoever he plays (it started happening to De Niro too after the 80's).All of that could have been irrelevant if the story was something to speak about. But it isn't. ""1984""? Puh-lease! Not even ""1984"" is what it's cracked up to be. Totalitarian bureaucracy ruling the world? I don't see what's the big deal. ""Been there, lived in"" (former Yugoslavia, mind you). But I do see why is this supposed alert of a movie so appealing to so many people.As other grumpy observers have already noted, ""Brazil"" is a one trick pony. It has one single point that it managed to stretch over a couple of hours. Maybe it deserves a cult status and, given the time of making, it probably a great deal influential. Nevertheless it's not Gilliam's finest hour. Luckily, he completely redeemed himself a decade later.",Brazil
149,Det_McNulty,"A Surrealistic, Terrifying And Yet Bleakly Comic Look At What Our World Is Becoming",8,22 August 2006,"A slogan ironically reads, ""Suspicion breads confidence"" and in this day and age where we are all slammed by terror on the news from the day-to-day goings of life this slogan is true. Yet is that the correct attitude to bring upon people? Doesn't that just make people more paranoid and fearful of the world? Still our governments and commercial newspapers couldn't care because they are all about power and money. For example, republican parties who breed off our fear of terrorism own a lot of American newspapers. Brazil is a film that also manages to speak out against consumerism (Think Fight Club) and create one of the most elaborate pieces of cinema ever.Terry Gilliam is a controversial director who creates contemporary art house cinema through mainstream Hollywood. He's been famous for having battles over the running time for Brazil with the producers back in 1985 and also sometimes has trouble getting his projects getting the rights to be made. So why does one of the greatest directors with one of the most creative minds have the misfortune of becoming shunted to one side by pointless action movies? The fact his Terry Gilliam gives out very controversial messages through his films, which are normally against an important dilemma the world is facing. I think Terry Gilliam is one of the most important directors because of his attitude towards our future and gives out very powerful messages through his crazy mind-bending films.Brazil is not a film that you'll often come across often, but anybody who knows anything about film would be able to tell that it has Terry Gilliam's trademark style stamped all over it. Brazil's message and stand points about the world we live in are far from subtle and are seen in pretty much the first 5 minutes of the film. The bleak opening on Christmas Eve where the shop window that has TV sets on display explodes to reveal a pink neon sign entitled ""Brazil"". Another important aspect of the film is the use of mirrors that represent the reflection of the lives people wished they lived hidden behind their false smiles.Not so much as the quirky close up camera angle with a man on a typewriter and trying to swat a fly reveals the evil nature and quick bursts of annoyance that people have. There's a strange sort of menace to the whole opening segment, filled with dark humour showing how the police force say ""we never make mistakes"" then realising they got the name wrong of the man they had humiliated and dragged away in a straight jacket. Then dropping the piece of flooring needed to replace the hole where the police had invaded through. This short sequence sums up the sarcastic and cruel humour than Brazil has throughout the running time.Brazil is visually depressing because of the situation and horror you are being faced with, but done with such skill that you can see the beauty and hard work behind it. When watching Brazil you get a sense of freedom and escapism, you can tell so much effort has been put into a piece of work like Brazil. The set pieces and general design layout the film has is unlike no other and perfectly creates the nightmarish utopia. He editing works wonderfully and fits in place with the movies slow paced feel. The characters are some of the best and most hilarious characters ever put on screen, reminding you of the Monty Python days Gilliam helped create. The music is very atmospheric and somewhat amusing at times. The cinematography is different to how most films work and makes these sought of dizzying camera shots of a ""world gone mad"".The cast has my favourite mixtures of talent with the likes of Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin and Ian Holm who all are important elements of the crazy story. Every single character is over the top and exaggerated with such brilliance that you'll be hard done not to find it very amusing. Everybody seems to work excellently with the fast paced script designed to draw you into every characters crazy mind. The script adds the feeling the characters are going through and the romance part of the film is a great touch. I love the cartoon style feel the movie has and the wonderful array of British actors to add to the film's cast.Mixing futuristic fantasy and hilarious comedy, Brazil continues to hold up as one of the most imaginative, original and creative films ever made. Brazil is one of the finest technical accomplishments in cinema and the wonderful techno 60s look that all these machines have. So Brazil is a very depressing, bitter and ugly image of our future, but one that seems far more realistic than you may have thought. I think over the years Brazil has become more and more prolific which shows how fast our world is changing and not for the better.The film shows how people create dreams to hide away from their dull and tedious little lives. Not only is the film to be viewed and found meaning on so many different levels, it can also be studied and has become very influential to the creativity found in many ""off-the-wall"" director's works. The dream sequences in the film are very relaxing and tranquil with an arty sense of a colourful world outside this industrial driven city.12 Monkeys and Brazil work as a fine double bill at showing zany visions of what out world is coming to. Brazil is easily one of the finest films ever made and creates something that will always be edged into your mind. Easily one of the best films ever made. Hilarious, emotive, sardonic, complex and imaginative, so what is reality?",Brazil
150,MrVibrating,Love it,10,23 April 2006,"...and not as in ""I love it"". I'm telling you! Just kidding. This is one of my favourite movies of all time, and deserving of every single bit of fame it has gotten. It manages to combine two things I really love, Monthy Python and '1984'. How Gilliam managed that is beyond me. I was really scared by '1984' when it came out and I'm still scared by it, but here, Gilliam takes the horrible and creates a fantastic satire.The message of the movie is good, and there are even some smaller sub-messages, and lots of commentary on society(or shall I say, kicks in the groin). The story is tight, and the ending is just fantastic. I'm so glad Gilliam managed to win his battle against his producers. What they wanted would have destroyed the entire movie.Set design and effects are super. The retro feel of the movie is consistent and present throughout everything we see. For example, in every single room, there are ducts and cables running, even in the over-class mansions. It really helps that it's a British story too. There's no way America ever looked so gray and dull! The British improves the comedy a lot too. Take 1 standard American and 1 standard Brit and let them say something. The Brit is always funnier. The dialect, the hints of old imperialism, the manners. Brazil is no exception. Even De Niro manages to fake his accent convincingly.Acting is good overall, some characters are really bizarre and memorable. Jonathan Pryce is a good choice for the male lead, he's just outside mainstream but very talented. Kim Greist, the heroine, is a bit weak though. Maybe Gilliam isn't too skilled with female acting? Who knows. It's but a minor stain to a great movie.So, if you love Monthy Python, feel scared by '1984', or simply want to watch one of the greatest movies ever, do yourself a favour and watch this film.",Brazil
151,Pasafist,The Greatest Movie Ever Made,10,6 July 2003,"I rarely use the word MASTERPIECE.  I've seen few films that deserve that title.  Of course there are great films out there.   I love FARGO and I love 12 Monkeys for example.  But no film I've ever seen deserves as much high praise as TERRY GILLIAM'S (12 Monkeys) BRAZIL.  A film about the postmodern age created for the postmodern age.It's amazing how one word can change meaning of any statement.  In BRAZIL, there is a stone with the statement, `THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE' scrawled on it.  In the world of BRAZIL there is no truth.  Only Fear. The world is run by one large corporation, Central Services, and like all mammoth corporations, nothing goes right, but in the stockholders meeting everything's A-okay.  Funny how propaganda works, don't you think?As the film opens we meet Sam Lowery (Johnathan Pryce, EVITA) a young man with idealistic dreams, and very low expectations out of his life.   He just wants to spend his day working at his job, and his nights dreaming.  His overbearing mother (Katharine Helmond, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) mother wants him to climb the corporate ladder.  Poor Sam, he just wants to be left alone.When a computer error executes the wrong man.  Sam is given the task to issue the man's wife a refund.  For in this world you pay for your execution and imprisonment. This sets off a course of events that brings Sam closer to his dreams, closer to finding love, and closer to finding the fulfillment in life he desperately desires.  What is the cost of that fulfillment? Especially in the nightmare world central services has created?  That's up to you to decide.BRAZIL is a gripping story.  With so many ideas crammed into every frame. It's the kind of movie that you can watch many times, cause each moment there is a nugget of truth, an idea, or some really inventive plot twist you didn't see before.  It's also full of laughs.  But since the humor is dark it may take a couple of viewings for you to notice them.  But by the end of this film you want to watch it again.This is also a great character movie.  Pryce is delightful as Sam Lowery. He's the perfect person to play the guy who tows the company line and yet wants to soar free as a bird.  There is this vulnerability about him; you really want to root for him.  But you can see he's about to snap at any moment.The most Brilliant performance is that of Michael Palin (Monty Python's Meaning of Life) as Jack Lint.  A nice guy, with a horrible job, he has to torture everyone who is arrested and you watch as this job gives him security and a family, but it begins to take its toll.   Gilliam gives him this great moment where he's just killed a man, and there in the next room is his daughter playing with toys.  You can see him try to drown out the voices of the hundreds he's killed.  But it's beginning to unravel.  It's a brilliant sequence.Robert Deniro (Analyze That) also stars as Harry Tuttle, a renegade heating repairman.  It's a really funny cameo.  There is a sequence that is both disgusting and hilariously funny, and it's Deniro's smirk that makes that sequence priceless.  `Hey We're All In It Together,' he quips.Director Gilliam and Cinematographer Roger Pratt (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), create a world that is stunningly beautiful when it needs to be. Dull and immense when it has to be. Cold and claustrophobic when the characters call for it and Dark and scary when it has to be. There is a melding of what I can only explain as THE WIZARD OF OZ meets film Noir. It's a signature look that is unlike any other film I've ever seen.
What Gillian does with models could never be faithfully reproduced with computers.  Sam's fight with the giant samurai is breathtaking.  His flight as Icarus is probably one of the greatest pictures ever filmed, and the final shot is both comic and disturbing all at the same time.  This movie looks so good.The screenplay is also great.  With writing credits by Tom Stoppard (Enigma), Charles McKeown (The Adventures of Baron Munchausen), and Gilliam himself.  It has a great balance between comedy and drama.  This is necessary for it's satire to work.   We laugh, we cry, and we love these characters.  Even if we hate them.This film also features a great score by Michael Kamen (X-Men), a mix between classical and modern styles, helps to create a picture's that are so beautiful.BRAZIL is my number 1 favorite film.  I could probably go on for pages about each sequence.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves the language of film, for it is a perfect example of how to do everything right.
I will warn you.  There are at least 3 versions of this film.  Never under any circumstances watch the television edit of this film.  It is a bastardization of the film and it renders much of what makes this film great.  Also, try to stay away from the recent Universal Home video and DVD of the film its also missing many sequences from the film especially its end.  I highly recommend the Criterion Collection version of this Masterpiece, which includes the entire Director's cut of the film-Passafist",Brazil

Gilliam perfected his style and U don't think he ever matched it, sadly. This film is brilliant in so many ways. Set design, absurdity, future prophecy e.gIn these Covid times they are trying to recruit people to administer the vaccine and they have to fill in a massive 21 page form where one of the questions is de-radicalisation.I digress.

""Brazil"" blends so well satire with Orwellian dystopia and slapstick, it's so imaginative and darkly funny, that it instantly became one of my favorites. This is basically a ""light"" reinterpretation of ""1984"" (somewhat reminiscent of Kafka, obviously), and has its quirkiness as the main strength. Although I called it ""light"", ""Brazil"" clearly demonstrates that black comedy can be just as compelling as classic drama. The retro- futuristic set design is simply outstanding (by the way, the movie is impossible to date – I couldn't believe it was made in the 80's) and the fabulous soundtrack will stay with you for quite a while. Being rather peculiar in its sense of humor and exploration of the absurd, I suspect this is the kind of film you will either love or hate. Either way, you won't forget it.

154,rsternesq,Not Quite What You Think It Is,8,9 October 2008,"This may indeed be a masterpiece. It has many characteristics of a masterpiece but the one missing piece for this reviewer is that most of those seeing it seem not to understand that this dystopia is the product of a misbegotten attempt to create a utopia. Even if unintended by the creators of the film it clearly is a critique, and a very effective one, of the left. The animating spirits here are Kafka and Ayn Rand. This is a nightmare brought on by those who traffic in control and that my fellow watchers, is the gift of the left. We each have lived down to Benjamin Franklin's warning that those who sell their liberty for security will get neither. Forget selling our inheritance for a mess of stew as did poor Essau, we have sold it for the promise -- undelivered and undeliverable -- of a meal ticket for a free lunch. The message?

155,Minerva_Meybridge,Incredible Kafkaesque Tale,10,16 March 2003,"This is not an ordinary film.  It is an adventure into the mind and into the terrors, which plague us in our worst nightmares.  The closest I can come to in terms of comparisons are Being John Malkovich, 12 Monkeys, the Michael Radford version of 1984 with John Hurt and Richard Burton, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and the all but forgotten Max Headroom.  Chances are that if you did not like any of those, you will not like this.  Brazil, from beginning to end, portrays life in an an Orwelian society, where things often go wrong and no one but those whom they go wrong for care.  There is a perpetual thread of black humour, which runs the gamut throughout, but the overall mood is dark and frightening.  The sets are complex and wonderfully peopled, like some medieval portrait of hell.  From beginning the end, the film is filled with mythological archetypes, threaded with the romantic fervor of Sam for Jill.  This is one of Terry Gilliam's most masterful works.  I also could not help notice the resemblance between Kim Greist who played Jill and Madeleine Stow, who played Kathryn in 12 Monkeys.  Hitchcock also had his type in terms of female leads later in his life with Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint and Tippy Hedren.  I have read comments asking why the title is Brazil.  Well, it is the title of the song that is played and hummed throughout.  This is not a film for everyone.  Chances are if you think There's Something about Mary was a fall-down, pants-slapping laugh and a half, you will not like this.

157,darin-wissbaum,Confusing ...,3,10 August 2009,I spent the whole time watching this film scratching my head. Was he dreaming the whole time? Was the girl real? Was the future world in which these people lived all covered with tubes going from one place to the next controlled by big brother? This film seemed based after George Orwell's 1984 in which every thing you did was watched and information to the public was controlled. Jonathan Pryce's character (Sam Lowry) is a man who works at some office in which everyone uses old typewriters with computer monitors (Again sounds like 1984) that seem to contain all the information big brother has on people. He is obsessed with finding this blond girl he sees in his dreams and spends the entire film using his access to these strange computers to locate her. The sets for this film are some of the strangest I have seen in the movies. Looks like something right out of a comic book with looming buildings that block the sky and endless tubes going here and there. Old movie posters are plastered everywhere that seem to be suggesting a better time or something. There seems to be no land left in this movie as everything is covered with tubes and buildings.The sets are interesting to look at but in my view that is about it. The rest of the film does not seem to have any focus. Why does he need to find this girl? And when he does find her what does he hope to do? Robert DeNiro plays some maintenance guy that fixes tubes and he seems strangely out out place in this movie jumping like spider man from building to building. At the end of the film Jonathan Pryce is seen in some strange room with wires and whatever else coming from his head which is suggesting it all was a dream? Or was it? Like I said this film had no focus and with the strange set designs I got the impression that they were there to distract us from the plot. If there was one.,Brazil

160,RARubin,"Visually Stunning, Script Dull and Long",6,29 April 2005,"Terry Gilliam used 1985 technology borrowed from Lucas' Star Wars films, grabs the best set designers and artists available Pre-Batman's Gotham, and creates a fantasy world of the future that looks a lot like retro-world, London, 1955. The designers have a fetish for duct piping and electrical wall wiring. It's fascinating to look at and with an eerie film score, it's unsettling to say the least.The trouble is: everything goes wrong when the actors recite dialogue and we have to comprehend a screenplay by Leftist playwright, Tom Sheppard. This is overindulgence in fascist nightmares. Imagine the Reagan Administration as the Left in Europe fantasized back in the 80's. They imagine the Reagan's incompetent, but Jack-Boot guards keep the populace under control. The environmentalists have been murdered and the world is a cross between an underground shopping mall and a desert wasteland with smokestacks spewing black soot. Jonathan Pryce is the ""Little MAN"" avoiding promotion to the lethal Records Retrieval Department of the totalitarian government. He falls for his dream fantasy, a blonde angel.

Yes I'd love to roll to Rio someday before I'm old."" (Kipling).A work of genius that should be viewed frame-by-frame to appreciate all it has to offer. Superior to most dystopias by virtue of its wild humour. It works better than the 1984-movies because it was written specifically for the cinema. Other people have explained the essence of this movie, so I'd like to clear up some of the confusion about details.The word ""Brazil"" represents a fantasy of tropical beauty to people in this industrial wasteland. This is an old idea, as shown by the quotation above. Of course, the real Brazil is full of industrial wastelands like this, which just adds to the joke. The monumental stairwell in Sam's mother's apartment building is a visual quotation from Black Orpheus.Those who have difficulty following the story should take account of the fantasy-sequences. Most of these are obvious, but there is a long, complicated one near the end. (Spoilers)After the words ""No, Jack, No"" comes an extended escape-fantasy which ends with the words ""He's got away from us Jack"". Nearly all of the movie could be interpreted as a fantasy, but this complicates things unduly. The story makes sense if the only fantasies are reckoned to be the angel-and-samurai ones , plus this one. This is the only one where grossly unrealistic things happen, such as Tuttle being eaten up by gobs of paper.The story takes place over 4 days and 3 nights, just before Christmas. Each night is distinguished by some disaster involving the air-conditioning.The imagery derives mostly from the 1940's (they had clumsy-looking TVs and computers back then), but in an alternate universe where many things are different. The propaganda posters deserve to be put on exhibition somewhere, sometime.You can understand Brazil better if you've seen earlier dystopias like Metropolis, Modern Times and Clockwork Orange. If you do like Brazil, you should also watch Pennies from Heaven (1981), a little-known movie that resembles it in many ways, and has the talents of Steve Martin. Brazil would probably have remained equally obscure if Terry Gilliam hadn't put so much effort into defending and promoting it.Setting the story at Christmastime brings out the sharp contrast between the soulless society and its dimly-remembered ideas of kindness and charity.One of the great visions of Cinema.",Brazil

On top of that, he wants to depart from being just another cog in the wheelMinor Spoilers:Brazil is one of those films that is so different and inventive that it's almost impossible not to enjoy on some level, and even harder to classify. It has fantasy, romance, comedy, and science fiction. Gilliam truly is a master of visual style and that fact is all too clear here. We're treated to a futuristic world, in which the government rules with an iron fist, controls all information, and imprisons those who object to it's ways. If you think about it, it's not all that improbable. The Patriot Act anyone? From what I can remember of it, the book 1984 has an extremely similar setting, and the similarities between the two go beyond that. I found the setting alone to be quite enjoyable. There are also many things going on in the background of the film that are quite humorous and contain hidden meanings. Actually, a lot of the film could be interpreted in several ways, but that's up for you, the viewer, to decide which way in which to do so. There could actually be an entire class devoted to the symbolism itself.Jonathan Pryce is perfect in his role as Sam Lowry. He's a man who constantly has his head in the clouds, dreaming about saving his damsel in distress in several strange scenarios, including fighting a massive samurai warrior and flying through the clouds with angel wings. Great stuff. In these day dreams, which are fantastically imaginative, we are forced to realize that he just might not be happy with his life in it's current state. His dreaming is a means of escape and a reflection of his never-ending quest for happiness. His romantic pursuit of Jill Layton's character in his mind and in reality, is very charming. Even though it's hopelessly romantic, it is not overdone and fits right in with the rest of the film. I especially enjoyed the ending and really did not see it coming. Makes perfect sense though considering what we're shown before.De Niro also plays a great role as Harry Tuttle, Lowry's alter ego. He's always sweeping in to save the day and sticking it to the man. A superhero of sorts, and no doubt the man Lowry wishes he was. It's definitely not a typical De Niro character, as is part of the reason why it's so thoroughly enjoyable and is one of my favorites performances of his.
So much work went into this film, from the characters, the unique setting, the score, the hidden meanings/symbolism, strange and quirky characters.there's so much to like, and that goes double for Gilliam fans. I highly recommend this film.especially if you want a break from anything close to typical.",Brazil

Life for the average working drone is one of drudgery, forms, tubes and ducts.  Lots of tubes and ducts.A literal bug in the machinery begin a chain of events that change the life of our ""hero"" Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce).  He's contentedly an invisible cog at the Ministry of Information while in his dreams he's a winged warrior. As a consequence of the bug, he finds the woman (Kim Greist) of his dreams, in his dreams.  He makes the mistake of pursuing his dreams.My only quibble with ""Brazil"" was the woman, Jill Layton, relents to be caught.  This makes no sense.  Once Sam sees his opportunity to live his dreams, he fancies himself as being that winged warrior in reality.  In other words, Sam's a loony.  Jill should be too grounded to be bothered with him.Terry Gilliam's a loony but that allows him to make great films of which ""Brazil"" is my favorite.  I love the Gilliam touches like the secretary who takes the dictation of torture victims and the serial billboards hiding the desolate landscapes.A remarkable vision of a society hobbled by inefficiency and addled by fear.",Brazil

It is just a plain cry that ""hey see there is a lot of corruption"". But man i know there is corruption and it is really troublesome but what happens if i see this movie.....well NOTHING!It reminded me of the movie Rang De Basanti which is just opposite and drills the corruption instead of shouting over its existence.

Black humour at its best, it was both influenced and then copied by French arthouse, but Brazil shows a restraint that makes for easier viewing than its sometimes over-intense European cousins.  The cast is eclectic but talented, the story is small scale but gripping, and the vision of an Orwellian world is simply breathtaking.I wonder if anyone will remember the Matrix so fondly after over fifteen years?",Brazil

167,bedazzle,brazil vs 1984,8,17 July 2001,"Interpretation, spoilers:There are two main differences between 1984' and Brazil.' The first weakens the villainously omnipotent quality of the State in Brazil,' and the second makes Brazil' a smidgen more optimistic than 1984.'
First, both works go to great lengths to depict the all-encompassment of the State in their respective disutopias. Not only does the State regulate gigantic bureaucracies and make for an utterly boring and apathetic lifestyle, it soon comes to tamper with human relationships.
Complete order and structure in the workplace soon works itself over to real life. Human life becomes petty, and this pettiness becomes a source of disgust for people like Sam who see it for what it is. The same disgust Sam feels for his mother and her friends is also directed to him when he first meets Jill. The negative qualities of villainous state begin to encompass the epitome of human purity  love. Yet Brazil' does not take this all-encompassment as far as 1984.' In 1984,' the State works directly to oppose both the coming together and staying together of the couple. In Brazil,' the State works secondarily against the coming together because of its mechanistic influence on human relations, but only really opposes the staying together of Jill and Sam. This is a mistake on the part of Terry Gilliam because he had wanted to go the 1984' route but had simply failed. The dream sequences prove that Sam believes it is the state that is keeping him from his love interest, but in reality it is simply the fact that they haven't yet met that keeps them apart. Once they are together, the inevitably fall in love. By not completely associating the unattainability of love with the powerfulness of the state, the general theme is weakened. The second difference occurs after Sam's and Jill's staying together has been put to an end by the State. In 1984,' when the main character is imprisoned, he is so thoroughly overcome by the tortures that he goes so far as to imcriminate his love in order to save himself. Brazil' does not go this far and instead shows the tortured Sam dreaming of a life in the country with Jill. Although she is dead, he continues to stay true to his love for her. Yet the ending gives a decisive victory to reality over dream. In this sense the movie and book are both pessimistic. But, within the dream, Sam does not feel that the dream has lost. He remains hopeful and in love, and in that sense Brazil' is more optimistic than 1984.' This hope despite horrendous surroundings is similar to a Christianic faith. No matter how horrible things in the material world are, fear not, for it is the spiritual or dream world that matters most. By showing a dreamlike liberation from the material world as a flying through the sky, the similarity of Sam's hope and Christian faith is evinced. These flights of fantasy even have a heavenly look to them.  Basically, Gilliam stops short in portraying to extreme bleakness and pessimism of 1984.' By making the State a tad less all-encompassing, he opens to door for a more-happy ending. For if he had portrayed the state as overcoming even the love instinct, Sam would not have been able to keep his faithful hope in the end. Once again it comes down to the necessity in Hollywood to make happy endings. Gladly, Brazil' only succumbs to this partially, and instead of putting an optimistic ending on a pessimistic movie, it adds an optimistically pessimistic ending.",Brazil
168,cwbellor,Epic descent into nauseous calypsochosis!,10,29 August 2012,"When you watch Brazil, you may not know what's what in terms of relevance or plot, but you will be oh so amused by just how inherently flawed technology is, by how tirelessly bureaucratic procedure can be and how bloated totalitarianism gets. Profound, I know! Did you ever even consider the drabness of a society ruled by absolutism? What's that? You're well-versed in Orwellian archetypes? Pardon me! Allow me to dismiss the symbolism and significance and delve into fanboy gab! Herewego!Watching Brazil is like eating a surreal birthday cake that gives you a sugar rush but then leaves you with a battery acid aftertaste and an excess of neurotic nutrition. Oops, that wasn't exactly praiseworthy. Let's try again! Brazil is an epic descent into nauseous psychosis. Ummm... I guess that's better. The jokes run longer than the industrial length hallways. The plot turning points are as elusive as Mr. Archibald Tuttle. You get a stylistic treat where everything is of questionable significance. But that's so appropriate because if you go through life questioning nothing, then you are nothing but a cog in the machine. And if you assume that Brazil is the first film to propose that possibility, then you are the same thing. Confused? Just watch Brazil! It'll all make sense ...maybe.",Brazil
169,ToldYaSo,"A dark vision without a happy ending, the way it's supposed to be",10,16 May 1999,"The story behind the making of this innovative and original film is so intriguing, that after seeing Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"", I strongly recommend reading the book, ""The Battle of Brazil"" by Jack Mathews. What makes the behind-the-scenes drama so fascinating is the struggle that ensued in releasing the film in it's intended format versus the glossy, happy ending that the studio wanted. The end result is the creators and the visionary won for a change, and lucky for us that Terry Gilliam is a stubborn man of conviction who believes in his work, or we might have seen something vastly different.How different the two versions are can finally be conveniently compared soon, on the special Criterion DVD Edition of Brazil which is expected to feature three discs; one for the director's cut, one for special features, documentaries and such, and the third of the studios version. The comparison should prove quite interesting.Animators turned film directors like Terry Gilliam and Tim Burton have tendencies towards lavish, outrageous elements, exotic costumes and set designs, and fantasy story lines that are bursting with creativity and thoughtfulness. It's as though they don't wish a single second of film time to be wasted any more than that of a painstaking second of animation time, which probably accounts to some degree for their approach.An interesting point that illustrates Gilliam's disdain for the studio system in a preview testing of any film can be found in the ""12 Monkeys"" DVD Collector's Edition, where Terry reveals that many comment cards from the ""Brazil"" screening simply stated ""No more paperwork"" as an obvious affection for one of the film's central themes and a like minded approach to comment cards. Much to Terry's chagrin, all of those support cards were disqualified.Films like this one prompt just the kind of questions that auteurs don't like being asked, such as ""Where do you come up with your ideas?"" I'm sure that Terry's ideas develop from the same place that yours and mine do, only his magnificent and strange ideas are transferred to celluloid. Thank goodness for that.",Brazil
170,SeptumSin,A very strange movie,6,7 September 2008,"Well this movie is a very strange one indeed...This movie is one of those movies that kind of makes you wonder what is going through the heads of people in the movie making business.This movie takes place in a not to distant future where everything is down to paperwork and useless technology. Our story stars a young paper pusher just trying to live a nice out of the way life but love intervenes and makes his life something that he regards is worth living and making a change for.The settings here are very strange and makes movies like ""The city of lost children"" look tame in comparison. The story is hard to follow at times and the dialog is sometimes also hard to follow. Otherwise this movie can be enjoyable and it's strangeness has an attractive quality.If you don't mind the strangeness then this movie is something to watch.",Brazil
171,benjamin_lappin,All We Have Left Are Our Thoughts,10,24 July 2006,"Utterly cerebral, and the very definition of paradoxical, Brazil is in its most simplistic form, an art film. Yet there is nothing simple about this film. While on one level, highlighting how we dream to escape our everyday lives, it is also an attack on bureaucracy and conglomerate companies. It also proves to be a scathing assault on personal perception, and (whilst not being a sandal wearing liberal) the conformist attitude of us all ""struggling"" to achieve this manakin-esqe look, so that we all may drift seamlessly without disruption to the system. Tom Stoppard, the Czech born English writer, co-wrote the screenplay with Terry Gilliam, and the resultant is something quintessentially British. Our protagonist, Sam, played by Johnathon Pryce (the devious news baron from Tomorrow Never Dies) is typically British. He is the underdog, completely hapless with no knowledge of where he is heading as events unravel around him, yet he is a gentleman to the end, fighting for justice. Brazil, is very Monty Pythony, and carries their trademark dry-wit humour that made them so damned funny, and extremely popular. Although, Gilliam is indeed American, and the input of Robert De Niro, proves to be an inspired choice as a counterweight in parts. This is 1984 reworked. Directed by Terry Gilliam, the animator for the hilarious Monty Python, Brazil is surreal, yet hits very close to home, its poignancy should not be underestimated, even to this day. Brazil in essence sums up how we all would wish to live, free of state control, being allowed to become the individuals we'd wish to be, yet are confined and restricted from being. This is not necessarily Science Fiction, yet bares all the hallmarks and trademarks of such a genre. Nor is it strictly speaking a thriller, as it ambles along at a brisk stroll for most of the one hundred and fifty minutes, yet as we ourselves delve deeper into the psychological landscape, it begins to hurtle along. The story has it's tense, mysterious and macabre moments that seem to gel perfectly, while the dream sequences that Sam has were simply splendid and very hypnotic and the same goes for the haunting music score that spirals with emotion.Brazil is dark yet amusing, thought provoking and enjoyable. It is truly an exceptionally innovative and, I do not hesitate to use the word, brilliant movie. It will leave a lasting impression, in a world, where nothing is ever as it seems",Brazil
172,LBytes,Either you get it or you don't,9,3 April 2003,"There might be something here that could be called a spoiler.There is a lot of imagery in this film that relates to the bureaucratic experience. I think it helps a lot to either work in a bureaucracy or to have some interaction with a large bureau to appreciate this movie. Those segments are just hilarious to me because they are so close to the truth. Individually, bureaucrats typically aren't bad people, but the end result of their workings is often evil. Such as the fellow who seems very normal, with wife and kids, but whose job is to torture people. He personifies the situation, that society can evolve to accept evil acts as a routine part of the workaday world. That was about the darkest part of the flick. Most of it is much lighter, sometimes silly. Jonathan Pryce is perfect for the lead role. The reviewers who have trashed this movie didn't get it. The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie a 10 is the music, which I found mostly annoying.",Brazil
173,donuthaters12,It Needed A Little Bit More From It's Script But It Has Ambition,7,16 January 2014,"Brazil is a film that I had major expectations from due to it's high concept and that I usually expect high ambition and scope from a story set in the future. The hype that I got from this film may be a reason for me that this underwhelmed me but it isn't the only factor.The film is written by screenwriters, Terry Gilliam, Tom Stoppard and Charles McKeown. Brazil's screenplay is where my problems are found as it doesn't seem to have the ability to grasp me in Sam Lowry's emotional journey. I can't seem to understand the fascination for this girl, and this is due to the film not really exploring the qualities of Jill Layton. If the film was able to show more shades of this character then I may be sold in the protagonist's adventure. My other issue is much less of a frustration, as it's more of a nitpick, and it is the film's attempt to be humorous. I felt that it doesn't work sometimes and it feels too shoehorned, not to say that the film shouldn't have it as it shapes the tone and feel of the film, and I like the way it feels. What did appeal to me about this film, is the great concept of this world that controls the society's culture to maintain 'discipline'. This hates anarchy, and there is even a conspiracy in there that the government uses it as a justification to find these so-called 'anarchist' themselves. The dream sequences that are sprinkled throughout the film is a great idea of visually showing us the themes and at the same time project an exaggeration of the situation our protagonist is in. The climax in the film was great for me, as it was bombastic and ridiculous, with a pay off that made it all worth it. Though the ending may not suit well with everyone as it may feel a bit of a left turn but I think it was well done.Brazil would be the first film that I have seen from Terry Gilliam's filmography and expectations were high. Though I was a little disappointed in it's script, I thought the way he handled it was great. Gilliam was able to show the many shades that this world has, and never to a point where it shows off and tries to be noticed. Gilliam visioned for this film to be in science-fiction territory sprinkled with fantasy, comedy and drama. Brazil doesn't can be taken seriously and if you remove the comedic sequences of the film, then Brazil would be a haunting and frightening film but the comedy in this film allows it to become accessible and easy to digest. The dream sequences are definitely a visual delight and feeling so magical that you can't help but be charmed by it. The film does feel a bit slow during the middle but it could have been improved with an improved script to keep me hooked. Gilliam could have trimmed a little of the middle sequences to help the film move along. The film in a way does get better with viewing but at a snail's pace.Roger Pratt's cinematography is decent here being able to show us the best and worst of the city, shifting from depressing to beautiful back and forth. Pratt was also able to convey the weirdness that Gilliam wanted for this film, which was important in developing the environment's personality. There are moments in Brazil where the image looks a bit odd, maybe due to a manipulation of the lens or using a specific type in order to create that surrealistic look. The colors in the film's photography pops, when it wants to but there are also many moments where the film looks lifeless and dull. I think the dream sequences are the most visually stunning moments in the film. I think this film may have been the reason why Tim Burton uses Pratt to be the DP for Batman.Michael Kamen has worked on a few notable films to do write the film score, and Brazil was one of his earlier works. Kamen's score here was a delight on most moments, with musical sequences that sounds magical and tracks, like the one used for the title and end, are catchy and sticks with you when the film's over. The film's score does rely on the orchestra approach, which I don't really mind but I felt it could have been more ambitious. There are a few moments that felt melodramatic and doesn't really do the scene justice.Brazil features one of the best performances from Jonathan Pryce as a regular guy who has ambitions and would do anything to get/protect it. I think if someone else took on Pryce's role then the protagonist wouldn't feel as convincing. The film also features one of the most surprising roles that Robert De Niro has ever played. De Niro doesn't get a lot of screen time but when he does come in, it does bring a grin on my face because of his ability to make us laugh and be so ridiculous without doing a whole lot. Taking a look at Kim Greist's filmography, that she hasn't done a lot of notable films. I thought she did her role here pretty well, even if there wasn't much to her character as I hoped. The rest of the cast like Ian Holm and Katherine Helmond did their parts well and was able to give off great comedic timing.Brazil felt like a movie that needed more but it's ambition and vision can't stop me from giving it a try again in the future. It has a great cast and a painting of the world that feels so frightening to be in without it trying to actually scare you. Maybe the next film I watch from Gilliam will show me why the director is appreciated by the general public.",Brazil
174,Targe,Monty Python takes on 1984,9,26 October 2010,"And the result is brilliant.This is one of my all-time favourite movies, although I must admit, I had to watch it 3 times before I 'got it'.The story tells the tale of lowly Sam, an office worker imprisoned in a near-future (one might argue modern-day) urban bureaucracy, where Christmas is continuous to spur on hyper-consumerism, women are encouraged to all get plastic surgery and dress in outlandish outfits, and the government regularly abducts and tortures citizens and conducts fake terrorist attacks, in order to keep control of the fearful population.The dream sequences, where Sam escapes to a world where he is a hero and free to fly, pursuing his dream girl and defending her from an absolutely amazing giant samurai monster, are truly works of art and worth renting the movie for alone.Robert DeNiro makes an unexpected and Oscar-worthy entry as the 'guerilla' non-union plumber, forced to dress like a ninja and climb around buildings like batman, to avoid arrest and certain death from the authorities for daring to offer some competition.The movie is crammed with memorable scenes done to perfection, like Sam nervously staring at a TV and trying to comment on a funny show while the wife of a man abducted, tortured, and murdered by the government refuses his mistaken identity refund cheque and instead rocks on her bed, moaning ""what have you done with his body!"" to him.Another is when Sam get's a 'promotion' to another monolithic shadowy ministry, and finds he must share half his desk, through a hole in the wall, with another similar employee.Even watching him try to squeeze into his teeny government issued car, trying to maintain some semblance of dignity, is brilliant.Sam runs through this dark, oppressive, soul-destroying world, searching for an adventure, and believes he has found it when he believes a real-life woman is in fact his dream-fantasy girl. He builds an elaborate fantasy world around him where the girl is a terrorist and he her willing accomplice, finally coming to the attention of the authorities.If you are a fan of dark comedy and the story 1984, you will love this, but be prepared for a steep learning curve.

The designs in the film are sumptuous, whether costume they be set or just plain concept. Cowritten by Gilliam, playwright Tom Stoppard, and Charles McKeown, the script is pure brilliance. Brazil is considered by some to be Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. I would add to that the movie Twelve Monkeys. Our story finds us following Sam Lowry who is mired in a futuristic society consumed with paperwork and procedures. He dreams of a pretend life where he can literally fly in the face of oppression and rescue the girl. There has been a wrongful arrest of a Harry Buttle. Sam Lowry (played by a brilliant Jonathan Pryce) who is just another cog in the system.

Ballard's ""Empire of the Sun"" is a lesson both in screen writing and succinctness. ""Brazil"" is no different.Gilliam's direction would be nothing without this brilliant script. At once redolent of Orwell's ""1984"", it contains a postmodern cynicism not seen since Shavian times: Shaw would have been proud.This film is, without doubt, a ""tour-de-force"" of contemporary cinema. The oppressive and always present bureaucracy, complete with ""Mother, I don't need your support"", eventually leads to a thinly-disguised Nazi solution. The notion of the Holocaust, is always present. The desire to escape and thus survive is ever present until the denouement: there is NO escape.The clues are always there: the protagonist's best friend being soaked in blood when WE first meet him. The constant perception that his life is derailed yet meaningful. (Let's face it, being a winged superhuman/obermensch can only BE fantasy.)I really don't know.

180,andrew7,Visionary,8,15 February 2002,"The first truly great film from Terry Gilliam.  In some ways, he's never matched it.  This is definitely not a film for everyone.  It is demanding.  It is highly unusual.  It doesn't really fit comfortably into any particular genre, for one thing.  I mean, yes, it's definitely comedy insofar as it is funny.  But it isn't really sf and it isn't really fantasy.  The world that Gilliam has created is both incredibly imaginative and utterly mundane.  This creates a real tension for viewers, I think, because it's hard to know what to make of it when you see these small,  bureaucratic, mundane characters existing in this mad, fantastical world.  Imagine a scene in Star Wars where Luke and Han are chased by Stormtroopers through the Death Star's payroll department. It's a combination of characters, styles, and settings that is utterly unfamiliar.  Unfortunately for the director, many of the films great themes are totally buried by the unrelenting visual tour de force happening in every scene. This film requires watching again and again and again to really appreciate. Some people would argue (and not without a valid point) that this indicates a bad film; confused, muddled, unfocused.  I don't happen to think so.  I think it indicates a film overflowing with ideas from all directions.  Every aspect of the production, not just the script, the direction, the performances, but the set design, the production design, the costumes, is teeming with wild, unchecked creativity.  This makes it, especially toward the end, particularly difficult for the first time viewer to keep up. 
There is so much to find in this film that is worth exploring.  But you have to look really hard sometimes.  This film was made fairly early in Gilliam's career as a director, and I think there are flaws which, perhaps, he would avoid now.  It is funny, yes.  It is well made, yes.  But I think it's a little too impenetrable.  I have no problem with films that demand more from their audiences, but I think this one goes a little too far. 
Still, terrific performances from Pryce, Palin, and De Niro.  Wonderful script, brilliant direction, gorgeous production design.",Brazil
181,AdFin,"Brazil Where hearts are entertained in June, we float beneath the amber moon And softly mummer ""Someday Soon""",10,19 January 2002,"Mild SPOILERS throughoutWe're lucky Terry Gilliam set Brazil ""somewhere in the twentieth century"" because it means that although now seventeen years old it still hasn't lost any of it's power to wow us with bizarre depictions of a (possible) future society. This is down to Gilliam's odd use of retro-design, like a magpie Gilliam takes elements from the past fifty years of history and fuses them into one distorted world, very few directors have the talent to create a separate universe for each of their characters to inhabit, but still manage retain a certain flow from film-to-film, but Gilliam never fails to do just that. From his first ""proper"" film Time Bandits (ignoring Jabberwocky which to me always comes off as Python-lite) right up to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas his cinematic cannon has taken the idea of fantasy cinema and pushed it to the extreme. Inspired by his reaction to Blade Runner and it's sell-out ending, Gilliam and writer Charles McKeown set about creating a film that not only continued the idea of the dreamer (set up with the character of Kevin in Time Bandits) but one that would take Blade Runner's invention of a totally believable world of a cop searching for his own identity, focusing instead however on a much smaller story... Or is it? Brazil is a film that thematically, is all over the place. You can try to explain the plot to people in an attempt to lure them into watching it, but try as you might the one line summary usually boils down to ""A man looks for his dream woman and is crushed by the state""... It hardly sounds exciting, but Brazil really is exciting, it's many sub-plots and hidden themes go deeper than the main plot to most movies, but it never loses focus.Brazil touches on everything from Politics and terrorism to love, death, madness (even Oedipus mother-son relationships are briefly hinted at) and everything in between, but Gilliam, McKeown and fellow writer Tom Stoppard never allow any of these themes to take over the story, they are there first and foremost to drive the main character. And that character is Sam the hero (brilliantly played by Jonathan Pryce), a timid clerk who dreams of more than a promotion. He shouldn't be the hero, because he's useless, he's pushed around at work, bullied by his mother, even renegade plumber Bob Hoskins gives him a hard time, but still we care about him because Gilliam so expertly sets up the world around him. Sam bumbles his way around wherever the film takes place (most say Britain because of the actors) dressed like Bogart but looking more like the lead from ""Goodnight Sweetheart"". It's no wonder Sid Shienberg balked when he saw the first cut of Brazil, here is a film directed by a former Monty Python member, the only big-name American actor (Robert DeNiro) only has about eight minutes of screen-time, industry is evil, plumbers are like terrorists and there is no discernable ""bad-guy""... More to his dismays, a so-called ""romance"" ends with the hero rejecting the world for his own imagination. This of course resulted in the infamous ""Battle of Brazil"" which would result in two separate releases of the film, the European version which I have seen, and the U.S. ""Love conquers all"" version which incidentally I haven't, but would watch out of curiosity. Someone a few comments back had written a review about Brazil calling it a ""bad movie""... Their lack of grammar and spelling suggested to me that they where probably about fifteen years old, which is a shame because that's about the right age to first watch this film (I was sixteen), because this is when you begin to go through the different emotions that Sam goes through. It's the age when most people stop dreaming, because they fear they are too old to dream, but it's also the same age you find out just how sh*t the world is... And maybe spending the rest of you're life hiding in you're own imagination is possibly a safer bet. 10/10",Brazil
182,thomasgulch,brilliant,10,23 September 2003,"When someone says to you that David Lynch makes movies about his dreams on film, please pass them a copy of 'Brazil'. Terry Gilliam succeeds on so many levels in this waking dream, so many veiled reflections on power, Bureaucracy gone mad, suffocation in an overly regimented democracy,dreams of power and hope in an emasculating environment, it is hard to sum up the impact of this work of genius. This is the most unique film, perhaps, of the last twenty years, so far reaching and yet never over-reaching - achieving in allegory and allusion what scores of other films attempt, but never succeed in doing, making fantasy, waking dreams, absurdity all relevant to the existence of modern man. A masterpiece. Bravo Mr.Gilliam, Bravo.",Brazil

A movie not for entertainment but for making a person think beyond the usual. Jonathon Pryce plays the erratic and bumbling Sam Lowry character to a perfection that emanates perpetually in the mind in relation to the future of humankind. So many great cameo appearances and such brilliant philosophical concepts translated onto film makes this a standout MUST SEE for the time it was made.One of my best films of all time which features concepts of state sponsored terror, false flags, Orwellian surveillance state and a crumbling society being preferential to an educated informed public.This movie although with hints of 1984, stands alone as one of the BEST and Brilliantly made movies of all time in it's own right.

184,petsteph1,Stunning and engrossing,9,3 April 2007,"I can't believe I waited 22 years to see this movie, I can't think why it never seemed to appear on my radar screen because it really is stunning. The story is simple: really a boy meets girl-loses girl-finds girl again plot set in a future hatched out of Terry Gillam's imagination. Every scene is visually engrossing, so well constructed in every aspect from the amazing sets to the camera work, that it's easy to become totally captivated by the surreality without losing touch of the biting humor or the many emotional threads woven into the whole. It's satisfying on so many levels that for me it takes its place among the very best masterpieces of cinema. The Pythonesque humor might incline some viewers to start watching it tongue in cheek as I did but it rapidly rises above and beyond that genre and you come away from it having experienced much more than a brilliant satirical take on our society - and the satire is scathing and quite brilliant. If you haven't seen this film, don't wait 22 years!",Brazil
185,Asa_Nisi_Masa2,Ugly and irritating,3,2 September 2006,"I normally make a point of writing reviews very soon after watching a movie, possibly right afterwards. This is obviously done to retain an immediacy in my impressions, essential for writing thoughts that really reflects my true feelings for the movie in question. In this specific case, I am sorry to say I last saw the movie several months ago - however, nothing will persuade me to watch it again just for the sake of penning a fresher review - I'm afraid this one'll have to do! My gut reaction to the forgettable experience of watching this movie was one of instinctive irritation, soon followed by profound bafflement. I wondered whether this was indeed the very same ""cult"" movie I had been hearing about during the course of my years at university almost a decade earlier. Could this really have been the so-called visionary oeuvre I had prepared myself for all those years? Instead, I found it to be not only ugly, vulgar, self-consciously ""original"" and bloated, but also very heavy-handed (which isn't the same as saying powerful or emotionally challenging), visually predictable and with an unoriginal, puerile, farcical humour, parodying what are essentially targets that have been parodied to death and no longer challenge or interest anyone. Furthermore, its alleged ""surrealism"" was groan-inducingly rhetorical. It was like a huge, gaudily-clothed, obnoxious guy at a party with a loud, nails-on-the-blackboard histrionic manner, forcing me to listen to his supposedly visionary existential theories, without ever letting me get a word in edge ways, all the while cracking obvious, unfunny jokes about things such as decrepit old ladies and grotesque plastic surgery, etc.Just pick up a copy of Orwell's 1984, I say...",Brazil
186,strat-8,IMDb top 250: 197? Way too low!,10,19 June 2005,"I just finished watching Michael Radford's 1984 for the first time. Brilliant and faithful to the book. I also just acquired the Critieron 3 disk edition of Brazil. At the time of its release, I thought 3 disks was a bit overkill, but now I know better. I saw Brazil in the theater in 1985. Dragged to it by a weird friend with strange tastes. I was blown away. I staggered out of the theater. What makes a great movie? Compelling storytelling. Great actors, great script, and above all else, something that takes you to a world you've never been to or imagined before, a world that sucks you in and makes you a part of it. Truly one of the greatest movies ever made. Should be at least top 100 and possibly even top 10. OK, it may not be for everyone. But you can say that about any movie. If you don't like sci-fi (and shame on you if you don't, beside this is not really sci-fi, and hell, everybody liked Star Wars (except my mom, but we don't need to go into that. She doesn't like the Marx brothers, 'nuff said. But she did like Shrek, go figure)), anyway...I identified strongly with the male protagonist, beset by subversive powers on all sides.

Damn straight.",Brazil
187,kylopod,Intriguing mixture of comedy and dystopia,9,25 September 2006,"One of the truest statements about originality in art comes from T.S. Eliot: ""Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal."" Terry Gilliam is one of cinema's mature poets. His ""Brazil"" features homages to numerous other films, ranging from ""Modern Times"" to ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and its plot is broadly similar to ""Nineteen Eighty-Four."" Yet the result is intriguingly fresh and creative.The best adjective to describe the movie's tone is ""whimsical."" It's the type of sci-fi film with an almost childlike fascination with strange sights and happenings. Rarely has a film so pessimistic been this much fun. Many sci-fi films since ""Brazil"" have attempted a similar approach, usually with little success. The chief problem with most such films (e.g. ""The Fifth Element"") is that they get bogged down in plot at the expense of emotional resonance. ""Brazil"" avoids this fate: while the movie possesses psychological and thematic complexity, its plot is fairly simple, and the humor, quirky as it is, never relies on throwaway gags. Even the oddest moments have a certain poignance.The story seems to take place in a fascist alternative world. It isn't ""the future"" exactly. The technology is weird-looking but hardly superior to anything in our world. Money transactions are sent through pipes in what looks sort of like a crude version of ATM. (One of the film's several nods to silent movies occurs after a character tries to stuff one of these pipes with wads of paper.) The pop culture references are positively retro, from the title song to scenes from the film ""Casablanca.""The evil of the government in this film is driven not so much by cruelty as by bureaucratic incompetence, much of which is played for laughs. But some of the scenes look eerie today, in our post-9/11 world, and are good fodder for conspiracy theorists. Pay particular attention to the scene where the official boasts that the government is winning its war against ""the terrorists."" The movie is ambiguous as to whether there are any real terrorists, and we have a sneaking suspicion that the explosions are caused by the government itself. The plot is set in motion by a typographical error leading an innocent man to be arrested instead of a suspected terrorist. The movie is not about this man but about a meek government worker, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), who's observing from the sidelines. Robert De Niro has a cameo as the wanted ""terrorist"" whose crime, from what we see, consists of doing home repairs without the proper paperwork.I have noticed that most of the classic dystopian tales are fundamentally similar to one another. But ""Brazil"" approaches the genre in a uniquely psychological way. Sam Lowry is different from the standard protagonist who rebels against the government due to noble motives. He doesn't seem to have any larger goals than his own personal ones. He isn't trying to make the world a better place. He's only longing for a better life for himself, one more exciting and romantic than the humdrum existence he currently occupies, where he's beset by an overbearing mother, a pitiful boss, and a dull job. In the midst of this bureaucratic nightmare state, he cares only about such matters as getting his air conditioning fixed and stalking a female stranger who physically resembles his fantasy woman--or so he perceives. The woman, as played by Kim Greist, appears in his fantasies as a helpless damsel with long, flowing hair and a silky dress who sits in a cage while he battles a giant Samurai warrior. The real-life woman he pursues, also played by Greist, sports a butch haircut, drives a large truck, and has a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth.It's a testament to Pryce's performance that he commands our total sympathy the whole time. We feel for him and go along with the romantic adventure he attempts to create for himself. His nervous, stammering personality is one that would have been easy to overdo, yet Pryce strikes just the right note, especially as we begin questioning the character's sanity. At one point, another character tells him that ""You're paranoid; you've got no sense of reality."" But who wouldn't be paranoid in such a setting? The scene brings to mind the old joke that goes ""You're not paranoid. Everyone really is out to get you."" The movie inhabits such a whacky, surreal world full of strange people and sights that Sam Lowry almost seems sensible by comparison. Creating a character like this was a fresh, innovative twist on a genre that normally loses sight of human personalities.",Brazil
188,fletcherc21,One of the Strangest Movies of All Time,5,15 November 2017,"Brazil is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen, yet it is not out of character for Terry Gilliam. Jonathan Pryce stars as a mid level bureaucrat in a dystopian world that is a cross between 1984 and the DMV. In this fiscally-conscious big brother government that charges prisoners for their interrogations, there is a form for everything and the bureaucracy dominates all aspects of life. The plot is meandering and plays second fiddle to the absurdist aspects of the movie.There are no likable characters, so there is no reason for the viewer to care what happens to anyone. There are a few interesting characters, namely Robert De Niro and Bob Hoskins as the two opposite sides of the central air repair business. Ultimately, not much actually happens, and a fair bit of what happens is simply absurd side plots that go nowhere and add nothing to the story.",Brazil

191,JoshuaMLosapio,Story and Characters Take a Back Seat to Dazzling Special Effects,7,19 August 2019,"""Brazil"" is a solid science-fiction movie that entertains with stunning imagery and poignant social commentary that remains relevant to this day. It provides a darkly comic take on George Orwell's ""1984"" that keeps the material fresh while being respectful of that book's classic themes. For those reasons I'd recommend Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" but not without reservations. Dramatic tension is absent in much of the film, which lacks a clear antagonist or interesting characters. Gilliam places less emphasis on developing a three-act story than he does on impressive sets and special effects. The movie is visually splendid to be sure, but art design can never compensate for a compelling story. ""Brazil"" is overly long with far too many scenes depicting monotonous office work and sometimes awkward action sequences that are poorly choreographed. I have mixed feelings about the ending: I like what Gilliam was aiming for and it serves as a satisfying conclusion to the film's narrative. But the execution is subpar, relying on the tired ""it was all a dream"" cliche that few filmmakers have been able to do well. ""Brazil"" is far from perfect. Yet despite its flaws I enjoy it anyway and I give it a 7/10.",Brazil
192,MiloMindbender,Sheer Genius,10,23 September 2001,"""The Trial"" was Welles' masterpiece & its hard to believe anyone could improve upon the original, but Gilliam succeeds in his thinly-veiled remake by adding humour & other elements into the mix.  Some scenes feel directly lifted from Welles' classic (scenes of government police coming in & interrogating, scenes of main character walking by hordes of office workers at typewriters), however because there is much more, ""Brazil"" brings in new themes (rich vs. poor, the quest for youth, the mindlessness of organized religion, male vs. female, reality vs. fantasy, the pervasiveness of advertising, etc.), ""Brazil"" is really a new story in spite of what it borrows. This is definitely a big screen film, meant to be viewed from beginning to end without interuption.  The sheer momentum of the social critique & humor end up hitting you like a train by the film's end, an element which simply can't be captured when viewed on a TV set, paused for a snack break, etc.  The film also fits many genres: comedy, drama, sci-fi, social critique (the love-story plot line is really not much of a romance, though some claim it to fall under this genre too). This is Gilliam's best because it succeeds on so many different levels & in so many different ways.  For example, it surpasses other sci fi films because of its timeless quality.  Gilliam never tries to pinpoint ""Brazil"" in time (or place).  Futuristic elements combine with retrograde technology (ie. tv screens with old typewriter-like keyboards) to yield an environment that can't be identified with precision.  Hence, the film doesn't feel as dated as other sci-fi does from the same era. Another element Gilliam adds is humor.  Gut-busting moments give way to the most banal & horrible revelations of modern life. Gilliam also throws the element of the disparity between the sexes into the mix,  Lowry's stature as a bureaucrat & his desire for Jill contrasts strongly with her life just getting by (the more development of her character would have been my only criticism of the film).  Lowry's fantasies of her (constructed in daydream-like sequences) & the reality of their actual lives are nicely contrasted (daydreaming becomes the escape by which Lowry survives). Dozens of other small elements to the film also beg for repeated viewing.  While much of the film is ""over the top"", the fantasy-like sequences & harsh reality of modern life seem equally ""out there"" by contrast, hence the ""larger than life"" quality never detract from the film's central themes & are in fact quite appropriate.  Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest films of all time......but you really should try to view it the next time it comes to the nearest rep house......or if you have the DVD, buy a theater to watch it, a double billing with Orson Welles' ""The Trial"" would be the perfect film-going experience for an intellect/art-lover/social critic; but if you only go to movies to dull you into a stupor, you might want to think about something else.",Brazil
193,yoyomagoo,Astounding stuff,9,3 June 2003,"Under the influence, influenced and influential- Brazil is both familiar and completely different to anything you have seen at the same time. Terry Gilliam's 1980s masterpiece has rarely been rivalled in terms of science fiction filmmaking and will probably remain a template for all science fiction films to come. It tells the story of a bureaucrat (played by Jonathan Pryce) who obsesses about a mysterious woman in his dreams. He is then offered a promotion, which would allow him access to information allowing him to find this woman. However he has carved out a niche in his current job and suffers from having a clingy boss (played by Ian Holm). His decision whether to take the job is influence by a strange set of events leading from the breaking down of his air conditioning in his apartment. This summary doesn't even begin to describe Brazil's plot- one of the many beauties of the film.Terry Gilliam's vision of a dystopian `future' is at once disgustingly funny and chilling to the bone. The brief opening sequence, culminating with a television set exploding sets the satirical, slightly anarchic tone and Gilliam follows this through with some remarkable set pieces, including a running joke about botched plastic surgery. The dream sequences are a tad dated but work efficiently, as does Pryce's amusing wake-up routine.The acting, here is exemplary. Pryce gives a superb performance as the troubled lead, and able support comes from Ian Holm, Kim Greist and Robert De Niro in a small role as a subversive handyman. However the standout is Michael Palin who plays Pryce's friend- one with a dark secret (revealed towards the end of the film in typically macabre fashion by Gilliam). His performance is wonderfully measured giving the right balance between threat and comedy.More eccentric than Blade Runner, more fun than Minority Report and with more depth than the Fifth Element, Brazil is a stunning piece of cinema.",Brazil
194,b-a-h TNT-6,A surreal adventure in human soul and society,8,26 September 2001,"When I think about movies with multiple subtexts titles like Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Fight Club and probably very few others come to my mind. I missed the opportunity to watch Terry Gilliam's Brazil for many years, but now that I have seen it I must say that it definitely ranks in that really narrow category of thought-provoking -- if at times difficult -- movies.Brazil carries so many ideas and touches so many sides of the human spirit and of our society it's incredible. There is plenty for a discussion with your most intelligent friends on the loss of human contact in bureaucracy, the importance of fantasy, love, nature... there are multiple references at alienation in modern society, the pros and cons of rebellion, the sometimes manipulative role of industry and the government, and more.It is, however, not an easy movie, despite its pretty basic plot. First of all, the movie is extremely surreal -- I frankly can't recall any movie where surrealism was pushed to a higher level than this -- and although this is not specifically a flaw, some people who like straight storylines will probably find it difficult to watch at times. Second, it is not an optimistic movie. It is, in fact, one of the saddest movies I have seen, because despite playing basically as a comedy, and despite lacking violence or brutal images, it pulls no punches in depicting the consequences of a society that does not fit the true nature of a human spirit. But it is definitely not a cold, desensitizing movie: there are some moments (especially the uncompromising ending) that will almost bring a tear to your eye, leaving you with the impression of a deep, sad fable.I have only a couple of minor complaints: I find Gilliam style a little overdone at times, and the use of certain lenses or close-ups unnecessary. More, there are a couple of scenes where the sheer brilliance of the rest of the movies is lacking, leaving the impression that the movie could have been slightly shorter without losing its impact. However this won't be a problem for you if you are willing to understand and elaborate on the movie's themes and references. And there are a lot.Extremely recommended for people with an open mind.9/10",Brazil

Jonathan Pryce is perfect as the increasingly besieged hero, but so are the entirety of the star-studded supporting cast. Terry Gilliam shows why he is without doubt the most visually arresting director in contemporary cinema, with one breathtaking scene after another. But it is in the film's bitter attack on bureaucracy that we find the reason for its greatness. The fate of Pryce and his few allies (one of whom is literally smothered to death by paperwork) is both hilarious and appalling, and chillingly reminiscent of modern society. Men in suits sitting behind desks have never been so scary.",Brazil
199,stefanbe,Brazil is an entertaining fantasy that tells as much about modern society as it was in 1985.,10,16 March 2008,"The title of Terry Gilliam's Brazil promises exotic landscapes, beautiful scenery and danceable music, yet Gilliam provides an opposite experience, thus we feel a connection with the main character, Sam Lowry. Brazil is nothing like the country and part of the reason it is named thus is because of the desirable nature of many who want to go the South American nation. Gilliam is intelligent in giving Brazil a dark claustrophobic look as this is not a light story, but one filled with conflicts that Lowry must overcome in order to find his dream girl and leave his paperwork-obsessed world forever. More obvious is the use of the famous Ary Barroso song used in the film's soundtrack. Considered an un-official national anthem of the country, the jumpy tune is the lightest aspect of Brazil, which works in contrast to the so-called utopia society. Thus, the audience plays into Gilliam's hand of wanting Lowry to escape. He intelligently withholds, but unlike Universal's ill-tempered boss, we're smart enough to realise just how necessary this is. Brazil's inability to go to the ""Bright Side of Life"" is part of why it is such a marvelous piece of work.The chaos in Brazil begins when the ultimate attempt at perfection leads to a little typo. This tiny mistake leads to an innocent father getting arrested, a neighbour trying to get him out of the government's hold and a lowly government worker chasing after her. Terry Gilliam, an American who spent years in Great Britain with the Monty Python comedy troupe, uses his use of images and subtle nods to poke fun at the bureaucrats who rely on paperwork to try to keep everything ship-shape. There is also a sense of secrecy in the proceedings, particularly in Michael Palin's character, Jack. Throughout the film, we share Lowry's perspective that Jack is a good man, yet once his true job description is revealed, the audience is just as surprised as Lowry is. Part of this is not only through Palin's double-edged performance, but Jonathan Pryce's work as well. Pryce takes on the role of Lowry almost similar to how the most famous American everyman would have. From his stammering dialogue to the wardrobe, there's a hint of James Stewart coming from his performance. There's an honest appearance to him that sets him apart from the dark world around him as well as the humour around him. When he was with Monty Python, Gilliam's comedy writing was mostly used for his animated shorts, but with Brazil, he became in command with most of the screenplay, creating a very humorous world. This makes the commentary on the dystopia of Brazil have a rather fun angle to it as well. The pains of ordering a simple stake, the quest for the perfect face and the government's obsession with paper-work are taken on through not only serious prodding, but humorous pokes as well.Terry Gilliam, like Tim Burton, has always a director with visual flair. Even when his films are less than average, his visual prowess allows them to be slightly more enjoyable. It is not surprising that his best film would feature some of his most accomplished visual look to date. From the look of the high-rises to the coldness of the government buildings to the duct-filled apartments, Brazil features some of the most stunning art direction seen in any film. Brazil was largely inspired by George Orwell's 1984, yet Gilliam creates a world that the author probably never imagined. The sets in the film were probably even more influenced by the work of Georges Méliès than the writings of Orwell. Gilliam's animation style may be considered third-rate, but his visual effects are anything but. They are so well done that it is hard to figure out whether they were done on computers, stop-motion or puppetry. In fact, the realism of the special effects allows the viewer to be whisked easier into Lowry's dreams.Along with Pryce and Palin, the rest of the cast succeeds in domineering their characters very well and understand that's Lowry's story. This class of highly accomplished actors know not to go over-board and bring the right level of humour and terror to their roles. Robert De Niro has a small, but important role that further alters Lowry's quest. Along with Lowry, he's the hero of the story and the calmness of De Niro combines well with the quick-witted work ethics of the character. Bob Hoskins takes on a more menacing role than he is known for, yet his sinister and almost scary tone creates Lowry's most memorable obstacle. And then there's Kim Greist, the main object of desire. What could have been a stereotypical female lead, Greist turns into a three-dimensional character that is the most cunning of the whole film. In fact, one wonders just how much she matches Lowry's dream girl. While, in that film, he does to save her and she cannot seem to get out of a situation, the real Jill is actually able to fend for herself in the tough world outside and is a more brave personality than Lowry. In the dreaded ""Love Conquers All"" version of Brazil, Lowry has a happy ending with Jill. Yet, it is a more open ending than the Director's Cut, because their relationship could turn tired as Lowry might realise that she is not how he pictured her. It brings to mind whether humming to ""Brazil"" is more satisfying, which makes Sid Sheinberg's mind seem even more warped.In the end, Terry Gilliam's preferred vision to the best edition of Brazil and it certainly is a marvelous adventure. The humour and the social commentary, mixed with one of the most electrifying casts seen in a science-fiction comedy to date. Visually impressed and featured one of the greatest songs ever produced, Brazil is an entertaining fantasy that tells as much about modern society as it was in 1985.",Brazil

The attention to detail (I just love Kathyrn Helmond's hat) and the blend of the absurd (the gargantuan bum suddenly hovering over the city skyline) with a world as bland and unremarkable(she's a truck driver)as it is far-fetched (was DeNiro actually killed by newspapers?).

All this horror get tempered by wonderful irony and tremendously funny moments.Both Blade Runner and Brazil rank in top 10 favorite films.  They have striking similarities:  1) They both start with 'B'2) They take place in a ruined, dark retro-futuristic place3) Both have many 1940's motifs 4) Both have an unattainable, hunted love interests (Jill vs. Rachel)5) Both Deckard and Lowry risk their lives to exonerate said love interests (or put another way, it takes the love interest to make them wake up from their buy-in to their world)6) Both center around hunting down 'enemies of the state'",Brazil
204,gracie28,a mind blower of a movie..,10,2 June 2002,"Just saw this movie on the big screen in a special showing. What a great great movie.  Comedy, satire, fear and loathing and depression all in one prescient science fiction horror story.  If you have not yet seen this movie, do make an effort to see it.  One of the great movies of the 80's and probably going into my top 20 movies of all time list.",Brazil
205,HalGuentert,"A ""Dr. Strangelove"" for the 21st Century",8,7 September 2006,"This movie was surprisingly interesting and probably ahead of its time in 1985. Being a student of real conspiracies (vs. theory) and political corruption may have added to my appreciation for the intricate plot, however it is an entertaining comic, love, sci-fi story with a message. Combining all these things takes some real genius.The title ""Brazil"" seems to have little to do with the movie, except that it has a sort of Miami art-deco visual theme without the usual gaudiness. It is visually interesting, with the hero's's mother being the closest to gaudy. The French may call this ""retro-future"" with a big budget style.A warning is that there are two versions of this movie, ""Brazil"". The original version is the best and the one I am commenting on (Terry Gilliam version). The second is a reedited version of the movie footage with a ""love conquers all (Hollywood) theme that is a good example how editing can change the message or ""propagandize"" a movie. If you are interested in that aspect, then you should see both.I found out about this movie from a positive comment made during a radio interview, so I had no idea what it was really about or even that the writer was connected with the ""Monty Python"" franchise. Since I am not a Monty Python fan, that may have killed my interest if I had known.Fortunately, the movie had some great actors, and did not try to take itself too seriously; but still managed to make you think. The DVD production notes cover this very well, but the movie makes you laugh and then later wonder why you laughed at things that hit so close to home in the 21st century.To sum it up, I would describe this movie as the ""Dr. Strangelove"" for the 21st century. It makes you both laugh, and later think about how close we are now to the structured world presented in the movie.",Brazil
206,Dr. Nick*#3,Brilliant ideas,8,22 June 1999,"I just saw Brazil today for the first time. I have to agree with most of the hype-it is a good movie with brilliant, absurdist touches that no other filmmaker besides T. Gilliam can seem to come up with.(He reminds me of Thelonious Monk-all you have to hear is one note and you know it's him)Some other commenters called this movie dystopian but it struck me as Buddhist or Taoist in it's worldview(discard desires and you'll see true beauty;Heaven is found when you know yourself and let go of limitations, regardless of your ""situation"" in life).Surprisingly, it remains a sharp and prescient satire 15 years after it was made and was imaginative like few movies Ive seen. However it could have been edited down by about 20 minutes because the pace was uneven and diminished the overall effectiveness towards the end.See it if you haven't already. >",Brazil

This is more like that time you strayed from your comfort zone with either alcohol or drugs or laughing gas at the dentist's office . . . and you just kicked back and let things unfold in front of you.

209,harsawa,"A dark and strange movie, but it grows on you.",9,21 September 2005,"When I first saw Brazil I was very disappointed. I've always loved Gilliams movies, but this one just..... I just didn't get it. It didn't seem to have the gilliamish humor, or the same style. It's premise is very tough to understand, and I felt that I would never watch it again. Well, I did and it started to grow on me, I can't say it's my favorite movie, but it's a very good one. It still hardly makes any sense, however.The movie is like a dream, and revolves much around the Butterfly effect theory. A typo, one letter is changed, and then it confuses the earth's government, and sends a man into the biggest hell of his life. Many scenes involve fantasies of him and the woman of his dream.The characters are just as bizarre as the movie it's self, one that particularly stands out is a renegade heater repairman (Who in the end is discovered and the paper work catches up and suffocates him) Brazil may not seem like a great movie at first, but it grows on you. It's definitely worth watching, but it's definitely Gilliams only overrated film.",Brazil
210,JonB-2,"The Definitive Version of 1984. No, really...",10,13 December 1998,"In my opinion, Gilliam's masterwork, and one of the best films of all time, with something new on every viewing.  Here are shades of Orwell, Kafka and Monty Python, in a world that is well-conceived, well drawn and very dense. It's also a film that invites the viewer to step inside and try to solve the puzzles -- because, on repeated viewings, you'll start to realize that what seems to be happening and what's really happening are not the same things; you'll notice that the line between the viewer's ""reality"" and the protagonist's ""reality"" blur, and the point when the blur is complete changes on repeat watching...Very appropriate for a film set in a bureaucratic nightmare, a world where paperwork can be (literally) fatal.  But, any description or analysis simply fails.  All I can really say is, see it.  See it again.  And again -- and watch as it changes before your eyes, and changes you.  That's pretty much the review of any film that belongs on a top ten list, and, for me, Brazil is the top...Incidentally, if you happen upon the Sidney Sheinberg ""Love Conquers All"" travesty... er, version of Brazil, avoid it like the plague, unless you've seen the original half a dozen times.  Then, watch the SS Version (hm...) and be amazed at how easy it is to destroy a classic with a little lack of understanding...",Brazil
211,eichler2,The movie that made me a fan of unusual movies,10,11 January 2016,"This is an edited version of the review I wrote for ""Brazil"" on the site where I recently bought the 132 minute, single-disc blu-ray verson of the movie: For those who don't know the history of this movie - there are at least three different versions. It was originally released in Europe as a nearly two and half hour long film. The studio that financed it didn't like that version because it A. was too long, B. was too uncommercial and C. had a dark, depressing ending. The contract they had with Gilliam stipulated that the movie had to be less than 2 hours and 15 minutes, so it could have multiple prime-time showings in theaters. They suggested he cut the ending.Gilliam refused, so the studio took it upon themselves to create the ""Love Conquers All"" version, which chopped out almost an hour of footage - they only kept the parts that showed the main character Sam in a heroic light, anything that contributed to the Sam/Jill love story and anything that featured Robert DiNero. And, of course, the ending was changed to a happy ending by removing the final scene. Also, to make the plot easier to follow, they used some alternate takes, some deleted footage and hired voice actors to overdub dialog.Unsurprisingly, Gilliam didn't want that version released, so he finally edited the movie down to 2 hours and 12 minutes, kept the dark ending and made a few other minor changes and the studio was contractually obligated to release that version to theaters in the United States.It's the US version that appears on the stand-alone blu-ray (the other versions are available on a Criterion 3-disc set). I'm happy to have the blu-ray version, because it's the first time I've seen the ""US edit"" since originally seeing the film in a theater on a college campus shortly after it first came out.I can't really write an unbiased review of the movie, because from that first viewing I became obsessed with both Brazil and Terry Gilliam's films in general. I bought all his movies on VHS as soon as they came out and eventually replaced them with DVDs. I bought the Criterion ""Final Cut"" version of Brazil as soon as it came out.It's one of those films you'll either love or hate. If you mostly go for typical Hollywood blockbusters, then you'll probably fall in the ""hate"" camp. However, if you like artistic movies that make you think a bit, this one's for you. Its alternate-reality, retro-futuristic look makes it seem nearly as fresh and amazing today as it did when it first came out. And the background plot of a bloated government bureaucracy turning the country into a surveillance state in response to a perceived terrorist threat - I know it was based on things happening in England at the time, but it's like Gilliam had a crystal ball and looked 20 years into the United States' future. The alternating between ""reality"" and dream sequences and the general Gilliam quirkiness will probably put a lot of people off, but it's what drew me to this movie in the first place.If you become fanatical about the movie like I am, you'll need both the US version and the Criterion release. To fully experience the film you need to see every version (even the Love Conquers All version) because each one includes bits that aren't in any of the others. And technically Brazil is a Christmas movie, so be sure to watch it during the holidays with your loved ones.If you do decide to watch Brazil and find that you like it, give some of Gilliam's more recent movies a try, like The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassis and The Zero Theorem. Really, if you like odd, out-of-the-mainstream movies that you'll be thinking about for days after you see them, you can't go wrong with pretty much any Terry Gilliam film.On the other hand, if you hated this one, best steer clear of Gilliam entirely.",Brazil
212,SteelBlue82,Bureaucratic Dystopian Future,5,3 August 2019,"The humor of Brazil is so quick, clever, and multilayered in a way that can only British. Much of the story gets swallowed by the visual component. The plot has trouble advancing because it relies to much on the fantastical. Maybe the plot slowly advancing is a metaphor for bureaucracy. If so then that was probably not the best choice.If you are a fan of dystopian future stories or the humor of Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy then this is worth watching. There are so many great things in this movie that I have to somewhat recommend it.Gilliam succeeds in the structure
of the fantasy segments and attention to absurb details, but he has problems with the cohesion of all the elements shoved into his film.",Brazil
213,plupu66,A valid idea done poorly,3,21 May 2011,"The idea of the individual lost in a mercilessly bureaucratic - and stupid- world is valid and of real concern to modern society. Orwell (in 1984), Kurt Vonegutt (in Harrisson Bergeron) and Kafka (in The Trial) presented it in original (at their time) and compelling ways. Brazil is a Hollywoodesque movie in every way with all the ""prescribed"" car chases, pretty girl loves pretty boy, evil people are really evil from every point of view, characters are caricatures and some torture/shock scenes thrown in the mix. The film lacks subtlety and keeps ""hitting one over the head"" with the same message transmitted in the same way. Paradoxically the film seems to be aimed at an intelligent audience but treats this audience with shocks of horror rather than with an insightful discourse. If you wish to see a really good dystopia film see ""Harrisson Bergeron"". Less shocking, more food for thought.",Brazil

Highly recommended for anyone with a sleeping disorder. Brazil will get the job done better than pills.The storyline is mediocre and the ""absurdity"" in the film is irritating rather than imaginative. I didn't get the film at all.

216,eebyo,A Savage Dystopia - just like here & now,9,30 September 2006,"All curses have their gifts. Last night, insomnia graced me with the chance to watch this movie again on cable in the oh-dark-thirty time zone, which is probably the best time to watch it. ""Brazil"" is the best movie ever made about the War on Terror, notwithstanding that it predated the real thing by 16 years. I respect all Terry Gilliam's efforts, and don't mind the repeated tropes (little people, mythic dragon-slayers), but this is the only one of his movies that scared me. It's acid, pitying, mordant genius. And much scarier now than it was on release 20 years ago, at least in America, where things like commando raids on fashionable restaurants that spew blood and limbs around the well-heeled patrons who know they can ignore it all -- after all, they couldn't be targets -- are no longer the stuff of fantasy. Most first-time viewers will be motionless with suspense, and I'm not here to spoil that. I'll just mention a couple of my favorite grace notes and leave it at that: the uncanny, creepy marriage of hi tech and late Victorian pneumatic tube-o-mania. The set is a work of design genius, showing the unbearable weight of detritus behind every sleek-looking screen and automated readout. Kim Griest. How she managed to disappear (more or less) from films after this one is an enduring mystery to me. A tough dreamgirl for the ages, she should at the very least have sold millions of posters wearing that truck driver's getup. She and Jonathan Pryce give the screen its best androgynous pairing since ""Christopher Strong"" or ""Queen Christina."" There's so much more . . . and if you watch with your eyes open, you'll probably see something I've missed. But there's one character, a senior civil servant, who's a ringer for Dick Cheney.

I thought its intentions were too obvious, its extremely over-the-top satirical pose grew tedious after the first very enjoyable 20 minutes, its numerous surreal extensions were pointless and dull, merely displaying its protagonists desires as if the audience didn't already realize his wanting out of his homely bigoted society. Its comedy was absurd, and at times fun, but unfortunately not sullen enough. Its appointed subtextual themes were perplexing and unclear, and made messier by its uneven, but intriguingly stylized structure. Now, I didn't hate it, because I did have a bit of fun with it, and every scene with the girl was simply hilarious, but it is probably my least favorite Gilliam.** 1/2",Brazil
219,HPeep,Paperwork and Beautiful Dreams. My Favorite Movie,10,20 October 2002,"SPOILERS   I got this movie at the Katonah library this March. I watched and thought, ""Wow that was pretty good.' The movie was better than I had hoped for. I liked it so much I bought the Criterion Collection's massive DVD. I watched it again with Gilliam's commentary and liked it even more. Then I saw it with a friend and I liked it even more. That was when it became my favorite movie.  Why do I love it so much? It's depressing, funny, weird, satirical, visually stunning, well told, and you notice more with each viewing (ex. the random explosions are breaks in the system not terrorists). Look at the ending. That is the only ending that should be there. Sam is permanently insane, but in his mind he is with the girl of his dreams (who is dead in the real world) living in the middle of the country. The samurai dream sequences are wonderfully surreal and could have been made into a separate movie. (Check out the Gilliam approved book Dark Knights and Holy Fools. There is a very weird dream scene where the sky falls into darkness as Sam is rescuing Jill.) Robert DeNiro provides a great role as Harry Tuttle and Michael Palin is superb as the brutal torturer/kind caring family man Jack Lint. The story is disturbing and depressing as it should be.   Thank God it came out in America after the controversy. Many people say that Star Wars set the system and Brazil changed it. Very true. Sheinberg thankfully didn't get his marketable-audience-friendly-happy-Hollywood movie he was trying to get.  Once again, the greatest movie ever made. If you didn't like it the first time, you'll love it the second time. Gilliam Rules! American Edit: A. European/Director's Cut: A+.

220,polos_are_minty,Brazil,5,28 March 2010,"i I am going to be one of the only people to give a negative review of this film. It's not like the film wasn't well made, it was. You can clearly see that there are good production values, and that a lot of effort has been put into bringing this film alive. However it is not in the realisation of it's universe that the picture falls down, it is the films overblown humour and inabillity to take it's message seriously that annoys me. The main idea of cinema is entertainment. Even the most visually stunning film in existence, would fall down without a good story or a good entertaining and enthralling plot. That is one of my main dislikes with Brazil, having designed his beauraucratic and futuristic Britain so well, Gilliam ruins it by inserting an assortment of unbelievable and ludicrous characthers, I'm thinking of Robert Deniro here.The humour is basically a direct rip of off Monty Phyton, which itself is the most pretensious, overraed, and annoying set of films I have ever had the misfortune to see. Gilliam seems unable to take his humour forward and instead falls back on old clichés from his earlier works. He seems to lack discipline, and jumps all over the place, we go from one strange scene to another, with no explanation of any details.Gilliam, to me, seems obsessed with hating the world around him. Even though he has never given it a chance, or looked around him and realised that what we have is actually good, despite its faults. Gilliam seems to be, from the pictures he makes, just another typical establishment hater, just because he can't accept that other people have to do things he may not like to keep him alive and safe.I did not like the story of this film, and what Gilliam is trying to say. However I can appreciate that it is visually impressive, for that alone it gets 5/10",Brazil

Interestingly, I thoroughly enjoyed it at both ages.Brazil is quite striking visually.  The dream sequences are bizarre, and the film is shot in such a way that you never really see what this imagined world actually looks like in its entirety.  Rather, we see life through the eyes of an increasingly alienated man in a social system that cuts people off from the world around them.The plot has been well document by other users.  Yes, it borrows liberally from 1984, but with Terry Gilliam's sense of the sublimely ridiculous that is distinct from Orwell's dystopic vision.  Thus, Brazil does not reinvent the wheel, as it were, but it does provide sufficient creative twists to dispose of any charges of unoriginality.Overall, this is a jewel of a movie filled with many small and large pleasures. I own it and have watched it numerous times, and every time I appreciate it just a little more.  I gave it a 9 out of 10.",Brazil

It is difficult to have a balance freedom and being managed.The present day we are overlooked by the IT, for example SNS.
The scenes of man's dreaming is impressive and it is looks like Japanese TV comedy.So, I feel watching TV show sometimes while watching this movie.

223,Survive_Kino,A surreal semi-comic take on Orwell's '1984',9,27 September 2007,"Brazil directed by Terry Gilliam boasts an all star cast, and portrays a dystopic future controlled by a cruel and bureaucratic totalitarian state, Jonathon Pryce plays the protagonist whose only escape from the monotony of his life are his surreal day dreams, until he falls in love with a woman wanted by the state for acts of terrorism, together they attempt to escape the restrictions of the oppressive society but the line between dream and reality is un-clear and the dream of freedom turns out to be a mere fantasy.I particularly enjoyed the aesthetics of the film, Gilliam clearly has an eye for the most striking of images, and he is able to use scenes of urban decay in London combined with careful selection of costume and props to create a retro future somewhat reminiscent of the film noir era. The basic concept is superb, essentially a comedy version of Orwell's 1984. There is some very cutting social commentary, aimed not just at the dangers of a totalitarian state but also of the culture of bureaucracy and the vanity of ageing women. The end of the film is particularly moving, when the protagonist's dreams of love and freedom are revealed to be an illusion and he is shown to have been tortured to insanity by a man who had previously been an old friend. This ending is shocking and slightly depressing, there is no redeeming element to the storyline, it merely illuminates the dangers of a 'Big Brother' state, the film suffers somewhat from a lack of characterisation, although well cast and well scripted, some of the character motivation is lacking, particularly in the love story, which seems as much fantasy as the visually stunning dream sequences showing Pryce flying with angel's wings and battling fearsome monsters led by a beast resembling a samurai version of Genghis Kahn.",Brazil

There are many films that the ""critics"" raved about that I didn't care for, and many that they hated that I really liked watching--but i'm sorry to say that this film just does not live up to its reputation. Yes, I understand it, and all the layers, and the smart little Orwellian references, and all that. I just don't like it. (except the title tune is catchy but-it'll get stuck in your head for days).The whole thing revolves around a man who is a ""cog in a wheel,"" that becomes aware of a mistake in the ""infallible"" bureaucracy, tries to correct it for his paranoid section leader, and gets in worlds of trouble himself. The movie is smug, pretentious, and thinks it's just so full of cute inside jokes, but the problem is, most of us aren't in on them.My opinion: If you like things like this, watch ""Gattica"" or ""Minority Report"" instead. NOT Recommended.",Brazil
227,redneck-6,Orwell with a Python twist,8,29 March 2000,"This movie did not leave me with a happy feeling when I was done viewing it, but I definitely found it well worth the time.  It posits a dark future world where the government has become a gigantic bureaucratic beast.  The simplest exchange requires mountains of paperwork and a strict adherence to procedures has replaced anyone's ability to critically think about what they are doing or stand up to the brutality they know lurks around them.  Sam Lowry is a man who seems more than happy to live as a cog in the giant machine.  When he sleeps, however,  he flies through beautiful blue skies towards the woman of his dreams.  As he attempts to correct an ""oversight"" by the Ministry Of Information for whom he works (one of the more obvious nods to Orwell) which has resulted in an innocent man's death,  he finds a woman who appears to be the one in his dreams.  The line between his dreams and his reality blur ever further as he goes deeper and deeper into the government machine to find out who she is.Terry Gilliam once again seems to have spared no expense in making sure every visual element of the world adds up to a cohesive whole which makes you feel as if you're really experiencing the characters' surroundings. And, of course,  it is a world rendered realistically enough to feel feasible,  and yet surrealistically enough to leave an unforgettable impression on you.Despite the simplicity of the main plot,  the movie is full of subtexts and images which carry a message even though you may not see them on the first viewing.  In one scene,  a man is buying ""clean air"" from a vending machine along the street.  The sides of the highways are walls of billboards which hide the barren environment beyond.  A group of people carry a banner that announces ""Consumers for Christ"" in a store decorated for the holidays as a small child tells Santa she wants a credit card for Christmas.  Actually, therein lies one of the things that may turn some people off to this movie. It seems Gilliam had so many things to say about the state of society today that some people may find the movie lacks a coherent message once it's done. The ending will no doubt come as a shock to many people as well,  but it was refreshing to me to see something well outside the Hollywood conventions for a change.My only real complaint was that Robert De Niro's character was so enjoyable, but saw so little use.  Other than that,  however,  I thought it was a film which presents some compelling things which deserve serious thought,  even though most people probably won't be able to get past the trademark Gilliam visual quirkiness to see what he is saying.

229,lukehere99,A funny version of George Orwell's 1984,9,5 August 2013,"Terry Gilliam, the only American member of Monty Python, writes and directs this comedic take on George Orwell's 1984. This is basically 1984 but much less boring and with jokes.I'll cut to the chase - Brazil is a masterpiece, reasons for this are about to be pointed out. But just if your wondering the only reason this is called Brazil is because of the song (by Geoff Muldaur) which plays every now and again in random places. The acting in Brazil is very good all round, personally I class the cast as an ensemble but some may disagree. Jonathan Pryce is the main character Sam Lowry who I have always thought is a lot like Arthur Dent from The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy. Robert De Niro is the rebel against society Harry Tuttle and is the most likable character in the movie. Bob Hoskins and Derrick O'Connor are 2 comedic ventilation repair men who come to a very amusing sticky end. Michael Palin (also a member of Monty Python) is Sam's old friend in a surprisingly serious, but very well performed, role. Ian Holm (was he never young) is Sam's boss and friend, Jim Broadbent a creep plastic surgeon nicknamed ""the acid man"". And finally Kim Greist as Sam's one true love and alleged terrorist. All of these roles are brilliant, funny, well acted and memorable.Brazil possibly has the best plot and story of any movie I have ever seen, even if most of the source material is taken from (the extremely depressing) George Orwell's 1984. Everything is unexpected and definitely not predictable, even the love scenes are unique. terry Gilliam (the director) is of course in the hilarious Monty Python team, who are in my opinion the funniest comedy group ever, so you would expect Brazil to be extremely funny. Unfortunately it's not EXTREMELY funny, I laughed on many occasions but not as much as I would have liked to. But then again how can a movie based on 1984 be that hilarious? Finally the ending - in my opinion Brazil has the best and most effective ending of any movie ever. This is a spoiler free review so I won't reveal what happens, but I will say that it's a surprise and certainly not expected.Overall I will give Brazil 9.0/10 and 4.5 stars, because the humour is not as strong as I expected it to be.",Brazil

Terry Gilliam gives us a splendid cocktail of all his inspirations, his idols and them who learned them. It's obvious that he read Kafka and Orwell a lot, and you can see the Kurosawa and Fritz Lang influences, but this movie boasts of influences. Paintings of Dali and Goya are remixed in this movie. And that's what makes this movie so interesting, it isn't only a very weird (but smart) story, it isn't only a nice decor ... but it is also a melting pot of great artists and people who inspire others day by day!",Brazil
231,Wilander,"If you only ever see one fantasy film, see this.",10,10 October 2002,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS How do you define a classic movie? By production values, cast or script? Yes, to a certain extent. But sometimes, very rarely, a truely original director comes along, takes all of the above, adds his own unique vision, and makes a masterpiece. Terry Gilliam is that director, and ""Brazil"" is his creation. The plot is basically ""1984"" made interesting,but for those of you with no knowledge of literature, here goes: Sam Lowry is a minor statistician in a heartless alternate reality. He stays sane only by daydreaming about being a winged superhero, rescuing a mysterious women, whom he has never met, but falls in love with. However, an investigation into the arrest of a ""terrorist"", called Tuttle, leads him into direct contact with her. To say any more would spoil the deliciously surreal, dark, and sometimes downright cruel plot. Suffice to say it contains explosions, torture, self discovery, and a truly amazing ending, (providing that your watching the European cut). What i want you to do is this. Get the correct copy in, and watch it in one sitting. Don't let your attention be drawn away from it for a second, as you'll miss a stunning detail here, or a sight gag there. The sets are awe-inspiring, the music is subtle yet effective, and every performance touches the right nerve. Pay close attention to Michael Palin's performance. I guarantee you'll never look at him in the same way again. Please, this is one of the few all time greats, and demands repeated viewing. I cannot endorse it strongly enough, but one word sums up its appeal: Babymask. Confused? Well then, watch it! And all your questions will be answered.

Plenty of that Pythonesque surrealism Gilliam is synonymous with too. I was a little bit curious to see this film, and not a lot more. Fair to say it blew my expectations out of the water.Brazil builds well upon some of the 80's dystopian sci-fi cult classics that proceeded it (Blade Runner, 1984), whilst maintaining its own inventive and utterly bonkers visual atmosphere. The outcome is vast in scope, scale and ambition. It's also bloody hilarious with some fabulous lead and cameo performances .

But then again, that is the same exact reason why people like them.Brazil is objectively a product of a unique mind. Throughout the story line and through every single detail in the movie, it is nearly impossible not to see the creativity. This creativity is demonstrated in a bold and significantly absurd way; which could be the only reason why it is so exciting for some, and unbearable for others.One thing that stands out in this creativity madness is the constant mocking of bureaucracy, which was pretty much the only thing that made the movie watchable for me. The production in general is good and the construction of the dystopian world is sometimes interesting.However, most of the movie is terribly boring. The boredom is normally not so important of a factor in movies, but this is a sci-fi movie in a dystopian world. Its instruments are solely based on the genre itself, so we do not have the option to say that sci-fi is only a tool for what the movie wants you to see. This situation is catastrophically ugly by itself and it can very well be the single reason to downgrade the movie to the depths of hell. Sci-fi movies does not have to be interesting for everyone, but it is supposed to be not boring by definition.I think the experiment in this movie can be considered as a very unfortunate attempt to bring together art and science fiction. There probably are some ways to make it work, but even if there is, it does not change the fact that Brazil did a horrible job at it.",Brazil
235,moviewatcher747,A modern day masterpiece!,8,18 January 2002,"Director Terry Gilliam called this a ""post-Orwellian"" film, and in a strong sense, he's correct. If you've seen (or read) ""1984"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" you'll know that ""Brazil"" strongly resembles them. This film is extremely intriguing and captivating, while the performances aren't astounding, it's still a very enjoyable movie.Sam's a meek individual who is promoted to ""Information Retrieval."" His mother forces him to do so (she's obsessive about plastic surgery and gets younger every time we see her). He stays in a small, cramped office and fantasizes about a blonde beauty who's actually a short-haired tomboyish woman he happens to stumble upon.The plot's rather confusing and the ending is long and drawn out, but still, the dark humor is very recognizable and there's even a scene near the end that isn't recommended to the squeamish. As I've said before, when thinking back on ""Brazil,"" I don't think of the performances, but rather the technically impressive special effects and atmospheric sets.What's the message behind all this? Gilliam must have been trying to prove a point. He wanted to make the viewer think, ""Could the future really be like this? Could computers rule the world?"" It could be possible.Another question: why is De Niro credited second in the credits when he's only in the film for about 10 minutes and Kim Greist is credited last when she's seen more than many of the actors credited before her?
And here's the answer. Just about everyone who's seen a half-decent movie in their life knows who Bob De Niro is, and not too many people know who Greist is...F.Y.I.: Kim Greist is in ""Throw Momma from the Train"" and ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey."" Most movie-goers would rather see a movie starring Robert De Niro or any other big star.All in all, ""Brazil"" is a breath-taking and life-changing experience. It's fantastical, surreal, humorous, violent, dramatic, horrific, and mesmerizing all at once. Sure, it's not the typical Monty Python flick. But it sure is a memorable one.",Brazil

Much of his work reflects that, at the bottom line everything is like a soup of vomit. Primeevil human behavior is like dislikeing everything, degrading everyone but one self. Take these elements and put them to the extreme and you get something like this movie. To have a good heart and a kind spirit is a rare engine to drive a man. But such things happen in this cruel and cynical world of ours. It is us or them. Jonathan Pryce plays this good man in this cruel world. A man who allows himself to dream of something else, a dream of being set free. Simple right? A natural need, but the question is the means to reach the goals of ones dreams. And a question of what makes a man content and happy of his moral standings in those matters. Sam Lowry never reaches his goal, not without significant sacrifices, his mind and his life. Good people are like islands some continue to prevail others sink, Archibald 'Harry' Tuttle prevails and finds happiness i helping others that is why he sinks, right. That is Terrys meaning of life in this movie, in my opinion that is. All Brazil the world needs is love, and love is the poison in which dreams are cast like this one. David.",Brazil

On the one hand we have a seriously strange and very successful dystopian, steampunkish 1984. On the other we have what feels like a 2 hour Monty Python skit. The two styles just don't play well together. What you end up with isn't a film that's 'strange good' but strange in its basic cinematic qualities. Everything from the set design, screen play, to dialogue is just too schizophrenic. One moment it's a dark and, I must say successful, take on a fictionary 'comunofacist' world, the next it's prat falls and over the top accents. You go the Ministry of Information to John Cleese's Ministry of Silly Walks. Even the characters can't seem to decide which side of the fence they are on with Jonathan Pryce's Sam Lowry switching from 1984s confused and scared to goofy and childish so fast it makes your head spin.

Even the 2 hours feel easy, as you just keep wondering what's next in the life of the young lost protagonist. However, it's a shame that the subjects wherein are explored so lightly - one would wish deeper exploration of the ironies of dystopia/reality facing topics that are important still today - excessive security control by the state being a de-facto dictatorship, etc. The story of the protagonist also feels that a bit more ambition would have been welcome - while it's appreciated it's not a typical ""selfless saving the world scenario"", it could've been just a bit more... ambitious!

The `Hollywood' version, which is very odd, has no flow and to be honest, makes no sense whatsoever. And there is the Terry Gilliam cut, which is just fantastic. 
First viewing, I couldn't quite believe what I was watching, it is so surreal, so unusual and a little bit unnerving, especially since we seem to be getting ourselves closer to the bureaucratic nightmare that is Sam Lowry's world.Ian Holm is, as always, simply outstanding, as is Johnathan Pryce and Robert Deniro (yes, I had to check the cover just to make sure I wasn't imagining things too.)  Bob Hoskins is great and, well, what more can I say.  Apart from very funny, very clever and very real.

After watching the film I said to my friend that she was innocent, while he protested that she was a terrorist. Between all this you have Gilliams absurd humor. From stupid military officers, to smart plummers and a hilarious scene with the cubicle next door.This is a beyond brilliant film that transcends to a legendary level, for me at least.

Its quick wit and willingness to sacrifice the accepted genre of comedy to take a risk is admirable.The political and dramatic undertones of 'Brazil' add the perfect setting for adults to enjoy this movie, with enough slap stick to keep the kids entertained.My only problem is that the theme song is stuck in my head.'We're all in this thing together'",Brazil
244,rainfall,How else to call it if not masterpiece?,10,17 November 2006,"I've been thinking about what should be the name of my review's summary but I'm not going to invent bicycle here, because ""Matserpiece"" is still the most appropriate word to describe Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"". Many times in my life I have encountered people who've never been able to understand this film. Actually I almost never argued because it's certainly different kind of movie-making. Different view. And it's not for everyone. I recently purchased the collector's DVD box and was stunned once again by the level of Gilliam's visual aesthetics. I've had pleasure seeing only one of his films in cinema - ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" - and it's a big pity because ""Brazil"" is certainly worth it, too. But behind the perfect visual picture there's much more. And this is something that can't be seen by those people who don't understand the film, because they aren't able to correlate the exterior look and it's inner contents. Often compared to other geniuses of surrealism like Luis Bunuel, Marco Ferreri, David Lynch and even Federico Fellini, Gilliam continues tradition of brilliant and stunning imagery while also attempting to express the workings of the subconscious. But Gilliam's touch adds new lines to the cinema of sur, extending it with amazing Python-style sense of humour. Actually surrealism, in my opinion, is impossible without the thin humour and it maybe makes Gilliam the last great cinema surrealists of the XXth century. Before purchasing DVD, last time I've seen Brazil was about 5 years ago and thought that I've remembered it very clear. But when I rewatched it, it's been quite different experience. There's something in this film that makes possible reviewing it multiple times and find new details and plot treats. In general, it's a unique dystopian avant-garde that can't be compared to anything else. Unitary sample as they say.",Brazil
245,diffusionx,Barely watchable,3,5 July 2000,"Brazil has a wonderful premise but nothing else. The idea of a future that is bogged down by endless red tape and paperwork is interesting. The ideas of the plot are interesting, and it seems to have, in theory, a lot of potential behind it (and would nearly end up writing itself). The problem with the movie is that it fails to come through and deliver on just about all of this.Brazil is terribly boring. So much of the movie feels like dead space: almost like they could have cut about 100 minutes and accomplished pretty much the same thing. It seems disjointed and feels bland; the world here doesn't even seem all that interesting (despite good set design, it just doesn't work as well as movies like Dark City or Batman). The parts that attempt to display just how bureaucracy dominates this world is really do display that; but, I'm sure, on an entirely different level that the film makers intended: they slow down the pace of the movie to a grinding halt and never seem to end. Brazil has its moments, but they are few. I think that I really enjoyed, at most, about ten minutes here. I loved the opening sequence (unfortunately, it gave me false hope for the remainder), and the first scene with Robert DeNiro was really good. He brought a type of vibrancy to the movie that it desperately needed; unfortunately, he was in the film for far too short of a time. If I had to sum up my feelings about Brazil in one sentence, it would be this: I could just barely stand it for the full duration of the viewing.",Brazil

But 2001 was fun eitherway, and your whole enjoyment of the film did not depend on theanswers to the questions you had. This movie did. I can't say I had much fun watching this film partly because of aparanoid and claustrophobic vibe, but also because the directordoes not keep us excited nor clue us into what is going on half thetime. I waited through the entire credits of this film for someanswers, but never got any. It's as if the climax was cut from thefinal reels.

It is so strong and so full of powerful images that bits of it keep popping up in his other work (most notably 12 MONKEYS).No need to go on and on about the film, as others before me have done that just fine; suffice to say this is one of those movies that either you'll absolutely love, or it'll leave you cold (though the same can be said for most of Gilliam's work).

Another difference is, Brazil feels like a satire to the consumerist population of the 80's, a world filled with cables where children were raised to consume and the grown-ups only thought about their appearance and tried everything to look younger.

He is sucked into ever deeper trouble by relatively small decisions. Many reviewers have called the film a portrayal of a dystopian future. That is not true - when the film was released in the UK Gilliam described it as 'set on the Los Angeles/Belfast border' in the current time. (I don't know what LA was like then but parts of Northern Ireland were riven by urban terrorism complete with bombings and British Army snatch squads in armoured Land Rovers trying to sweep up terrorists and their support networks.) As an aside, I recall that many of the locations used existing buildings, be they huge silos (the Records Office set was built under the hoppers of one facility), a dismal council tower block complex located where Disneyland Paris is now (the Buttles' home), the inside of a cooling tower (used for the interrogation sequences) or even Her Majesty's Stationery Office (used for 2 weeks to film the flight sequences). There is a lot of dark humour in the film - and satire at what Britain was like then (e.g. 'Central Services' lampooning the state controlled monopolies and the pneumatic tubes & ducts that were still present in some department stores and offices).In conclusion the film has aged well.

Now usually that guy keeps only popular fast-selling titles, so I grabbed this title faster than you can say ""Bra---"". It was lying in my folder for about 3 weeks and I managed to see it yesterday evening. Quite obviously, no one understood this gem after a single viewing.What bothered me, though, was the poor dubbing and choppy editing. Didn't seem like the cult-classic they said it was. Googling away I discovered that some nut-case stuio-head at Universal Pictures (I hope he suffered for his sins!!) decided to hack the movie and release it his own way. The 94 minute version sub-titled ""Love Conquers All"" is nothing like the Terry Gilliam movie. I write this review mainly to warn other unsuspecting buyers from getting conned.Before buying, please ensure it is the 142 minute edit originally made by Terry Gilliam. It is also known as the Criterion Collection, it seems.The LCA edit has a lot of rearranged sequences and over-dubbing to match the (lack of) vision that the studio head aimed to create. What you do appreciate is the awesome art direction, set designs and photographic tricks. Our future, though a little more slick, is not so very different from Gilliam's view of 20th century. We all live in matchbox sized houses, with broom-closet offices (""cubicles"") and omnipresent paranoia. Anyone who disagrees with the official view of Terrorism is himself branded as one!!!

The film follows Sam Lowery, a government employee with-in the ministry of information as a string of administrative errors and his attempts to track down the literal woman of his dreams land him in hot water with the State. The bleak stylised retro-future and surrealist nightmare world slowly meld throughout the film concluding with a violent collision of the two realities.A rich and interesting world which begs to be explored is populated with scores of eccentric characters interwoven into a noir inspired story which compels from start to finish. In concept this dystopian future draws heavily from the literary classic 1984 but, with such creative flare the picture stands as its own unique work. Using film's strength as a visual medium to full effect; the camera work is expressive, the costuming bold, the sets fantastically cartoonish and the colour palette stylised.There may not be great depth in the exploration of our protagonist's fears or in the critique of exaggerated bureaucracy and superficiality but, the film remains an impressive exhibition of creativity and a great example of the variety of artistic expression possible through cinema.",Brazil
260,sandrewsmith,"About the ""Love Conquers All"" version (spoilers)",10,4 September 2003,"Those of us who are complete nerds and own the Criterion Collection DVD of Brazil have the unique opportunity to watch the above-mentioned version of the movie, to which Terry Gilliam refers as ""Sidney Sheinberg's 'Brazil'"". This is the cut originally intended to be released in America by Universal Pictures. Sheinberg was a Universal executive who was convinced that Brazil was too long, cerebral and depressing for American audiences. To make a long story short, forty minutes were cut from the film and the ending was changed completely. Gilliam refused to have anything to do with this and insisted that his name be taken off the picture if it was released in this form. Eventually, after a lengthy and acrimonious public battle, the movie was released with Gilliam's cut restored. The ""Love Conquers All"" version, as Sheinberg's cut became known, was eventually broadcast on television. Sheinberg's arguments do hold a little water: the picture did indeed become a ""cult"" item instead of a blockbuster, and barely broke even in the box office. However, upon seeing this version, that argument falls apart completely. This is still ""Brazil"", but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Nearly every scene has had a significant chunk cut out. Irritating and stupid ADR lines pop up occasionally, like: Tuttle: ""We have to fight back, Sam. We have to fight back.""
There are new and unnecessary musical cues in scenes that did not have them before. Also, most of the fantasy sequences have been removed, including those with the ""hideous baby"" creatures. This fails to set up one of the most important moments in the movie: when Jack arrives  in a ""hideous baby"" mask to interrogate Sam. This completely changes the nature of the biggest fantasy of them all: the final battle. Though much of it remains, it is now cinematic ""reality"" and ends with Sam and Jill living happily every after. The ""filmmakers"" don't explain how Tuttle could disappear inside the paperwork in this sequence. It makes sense in a hallucination or dream, but doesn't at all when presented as ""reality"". This is but a small sampling of the crimes Sheinberg committed against Gilliam's wonderful film. All of the joy, humor, despair and dread were systematically leached out the movie in favor of making a typical ""good vs. evil"" boxing match. Even the swear words were cut out! The effect is as if someone had taken Dali's ""Persistence of Time"" and cut out all of those pesky soft watches, 'cause they don't make sense. The problem, of course, since all meaning and invention have been removed, is that it now makes even less sense than the original. Only the desert landscape remains - thus, ""Sidney Sheinberg's 'Brazil'"" is a wasteland of a movie. See it at your peril.",Brazil

I am quite used to the visual, plots and general style of the 80's 90's movies but this one that I watch for the first time in 2012 cannot take any appreciations from me.Visually speaking the only word coming to my mind is cheap. In terms of dialogs I would honestly say, with all due respect to the tam who did this movie and peoples who love it, ridiculous. The scene when the main carachter is in the truck wit is dream girl for the first time, when he announce his love for her, is just the weakest set of sentences and whole situation I ever seen in a movie.As for the plot, it sometimes started to pick up into an interesting point of view about the administration labyrinth, the system weight on individuals but what else from that ? A rebellion, a fight, an acceptance of the situation ? not to me, just a weirdo story without a constructive or productive meaning.I can perfectly guess and understand that fans might be outraged of such opinion while they are sure that I missed the points, but I could not recommend this movie to anybody. In it times it was maybe revolutionary in many senses but in 2012 I just see a lost of time.",Brazil
263,Shnorg2342,Brazil- A Perfect Satire,10,25 November 2019,"Brazil is a fantastic satire, and a touching film. After a filing error, resulting in the wrongful arrest and eventual death of and innocent man, low level bureaucrat, Sam Lowry, is caught up in a complicated mess of government ineffectiveness, terrorism, and love. Lowry is a daydreamer, and often imagines himself in situations such that Greek heroes might find themselves in. In these daydreams he sees a recurring blonde woman, and it is often his task to save her. These visions get more and more strange as the film goes on, and Lowry's mental state decreases. The film is a very funny satire, which makes sense seeing as Terry Gilliam got his start in Monty Python. Characters will be out at dinner, and a terrorist bombing will happen about 40 feet away from them, and no one bats an eye because this is such a common occurrence. A lot of the events in the film are caused by Lowry's infatuation with a woman, who he has never met, that looks identical to the one in his visions. Lowry suspects she may be a terrorist, but chases after her anyway. One of the best performances in the film is Robert De Niro's portrayal of a rogue ventilation repair man, who's job is technically illegal, which means he'll do anything to avoid encountering government agents. He carry's a gun on him at all times, and zip lines from place-to-place. It is later revealed that he is an anti-establishment serial bombing terrorist, and it is hard to imagine, because of the pure glee the character seems to always be experiencing. Lowry's visions get increasingly frequent as the film goes on, often being symbolic of the character's true feelings at the time. The entire ending 20 minutes ish of the film is revealed to be one of these visions. Lowry's mind slipped into a state of permanent delusion, while he was being tortured for aiding a known terrorist. This turn of events may seem tragic, but it's really not. Lowry's mind is in pure bliss, with his newfound imaginary girlfriend and freedom. I like to think that this is Gilliam saying that the only way to be truly happy in a state controlled nightmare is to go completely mad. A fantastic film, it's almost a mix between Paul Verhoeven themes and David Lynch imagery, although not as extremely strange as most of Lynch's work. Brazil is a truly perfect film.

264,ashcrda,What we have now and where we're going,10,29 April 2014,"Since September 11, 2001 our government has gotten more and more repressive, has taken many liberties, and continues to become more repressive. The constant cry of ""terrorists"" at the heart of the movie is eerily prescient; we essentially have the same situation. When we're afraid of getting in trouble we export our victims so less reasonable people can torture them. Our information retrieval includes water boarding and other tortures. The continuous collection of data matches our NSA activity. Errors in the system indict people who are otherwise innocent.Within the horrifying fascist theme I got a kick out of the improvisational scene with Bob Hoskins and his co-actor as they as they attempted to impose their bureaucratic will on his heating and cooling system. And I'll never stop laughing every time I see the pipes switched so that Hoskins and company find themselves in poop filled protective suits. The only scene comparable is the ""Come and Get It"" scene in ""Magic Christian.""(1969) The first time I watched ""Brazil"" an alarm clock set by my daughters as a trick on me went off as the movie ended. Hearing the pulsing electronic buzz it went through my mind that they had come to collect me for information retrieval. Great cognitive dissonance.You can still occasionally catch this film on TV, but it is an edition heavily edited and transformed by the studio. That version has a sort of ""happy ending"" that is pretty lame compared to the directors cut.With ""Blade Runner"" this is one of my favorite films that accurately skewers our culture and should instill fear in everyone.",Brazil

Oh, yeah: It was *different*...",10,19 October 1998,"Terry Gilliam is, hands down, the most original filmmaker working today--the crown prince worthy of occupying Orson Welles' extra-large throne. ""Brazil"" stands as his landmark achievement: Funny and satirical enough for the Monty Python crowd, yet simultaneously brilliant in its intellectual endeavors. Comedy with a brain.Everything about the execution of this project simply reeks of genius. The script by Gilliam, Charles McKeown, and Tom Stoppard (whose ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"" is of an equal measure of genius) keeps us just enough in the know so we can keep up with poor Sam Lowry but never a step ahead of him. The visuals, even thirteen years later, remain the standard by which all others must be judged. Gilliam's direction--in all its wicked originality--speaks volumes even when the characters' tongues are silent. And, of course, one of Jonathan Pryce's best performances cannot go unnoticed.Not a movie for those who found ""Total Recall"" too confusing, but well worth the effort of concentration necessary to lift all the meaning out of a dense-pack of information.",Brazil

269,lloydmorgan111222,Great World Undermined By Underdeveloped Characters,6,31 December 2015,"'Brazil' suffers from a problem that I encounter a lot more than I would like to. It is a very well made film that falls flat in the character department.The best thing about the film is the dystopian setting. The production design creates a zeerust (http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust) version of what appears to be Britain that is visually compelling. It reminded me of how the inventions looked in the 'Wallace and Gromit' series. Like the setting and technology in 'Brazil', the inventions are designed to make our lives easier but do the exact opposite instead.That is the film's main theme. Our protagonist, Sam Lowry, works for the Ministry of Information. A totalitarian bureaucracy that runs society, the MOI is founded upon an over-reliance on paperwork. Every action must be carried out through a form or a receipt. The drive to make life easier and more efficient is causing society to become needlessly complicated.When it comes to the score of the film, I tend to notice it at the beginning but become more focused on the characters and the story later on. This applies to 'Brazil' as well. Some pieces of music did stand out to me, however. I don't remember them exactly but I do remember them feeling epic and intense. Unfortunately, they would have had more of an impact if it weren't for an important element that I will get to in a bit.Another great aspect of the film is the ending. I won't say much about it expect that it is fitting and engaging. The film as a whole is well directed but the ending stands out the most to me in this regard. It is probably my favourite part of the film.Unfortunately, the great aspects of the film lose some of their impact due to the main character. Sam isn't a blank slate. He is an average if slightly nervous guy who is pretty comfortable in his relatively low position at the MOI. However, I felt that his character needed more depth to him. There isn't much about him that is interesting. He isn't very likable or relatable either. The story is driven by his pursuit of a woman named Jill who he appears in his dreams before he notices her in real life. It is difficult to like or care for him when he's making himself look idiotic chasing a woman who doesn't know him or have any interest in him. It doesn't help that she doesn't have much to her character. She cares about the wellbeing of her downstairs neighbour and finds the bureaucratic government frustrating but there's nothing to her that makes Sam's attraction to her believable outside of simple lust. Granted, she probably symbolises the happier and freer life beyond the world Sam is trapped in but that doesn't work well when he seems to be simply inconvenienced by the world rather than trapped in it. The performances are perfectly fine. Jonathan Pryce, who plays Sam, is particularly well suited to his character. The problems with his character would have been exacerbated by less suitable actor.Both the design and the ideas that form the dystopia are great but the uninteresting inhabitants undermine them. If they were more engaging, I would have had more interest in the film as a whole. I seem to be in the minority since there are plenty of people who love this film. There isn't as much here for me as I wanted but the stuff that works is pretty good. I would recommend checking this one out even if it's just to say you have seen it.",Brazil
270,david_peckham,Would Have Loved to Give it a 10,7,11 September 2002,"In retrospect its an incredibly cool movie, great concept, (probably more original when it was made) and well directed.  There are some things that just stick out in your mind, like his mother's plastic surgery habit and the shot from inside the torture chamber when it zooms out is a wonderful visual.   All this being said the movie is often times a bit of a bore to watch because it drags on.  I only wish it had been trimmed by maybe half an hour because there a scenes that drag on and don't seem to go anywhere. This kind of movie could have done with faster cuts and fewer scenes where characters just walk around the sets in silence for however long an amount of time.  Of course, this is just my opinion.  I'm not saying i wanted a music video...also, i have heard the studio recut a ""love conquers all"" version of the film that is 90 minutes long so they must have had some of the same opinions as me.  however, this other version has a happy ending which i don't think fits at all in this kind of film.  a 7 out of 10 but groundbreaking nonetheless.",Brazil
271,talkjawking100,"A combination of The Never-Ending Story and an episode of ""The Office"", but swirled and composited together in such a magnificent way, it would make Kubrick blush.",10,29 October 2007,"Have you ever felt a gaping hole in your life? A hole in the shape of a desire to see a really good fantasy film that parades on an industrialized world with elemental characters that work with that plot in ways that send shivers down your spine? Well, this film will fill such a hole.In a world full of remakes, sequels, book adaptations, and formulated/reformulated dry plots, seeing a film that breaks so many boundaries is almost an unbelieving experience. I almost felt the desire to pinch myself while viewing this film to see if it was real. It's a story with a fun-o-meter that goes beyond the breaking point well after the first hour. However, it has a peculiar way of going around it. I felt confused for the first half-hour as to why so many film-goers loved it, because as far as I could tell, it was another crazy Gilliam cartoon with an established script and a wide-angle lens to match.Slowly, we go into the psyche of the plot and characters, and a glowing admiration grows in the mind, which grows on the verge of exploding on the film's final frames (assuming you're watching the director's edition of the film).In England, sometime in the future, Sam Lowry works in a hustle and bustle office and is constantly visited by strange fairy-tale dreams involving an angelic woman whom he doesn't know. When he finally sees the woman in real life he does all he can within the power of his work position to meet her and fall in love with each other. With side performances including Robert DeNiro as the wacky superhero-esquire illegal heat technician, and ex-Monty Python member Michael Palin as Lowry's strange family-man boss whose job description seems to include secretly creating mass genocide, you may think the cast alone is a worthwhile reason to see this movie. But there is more.Former Monty Python animator, the film's writer/director Terry Gilliam proves his true passion and talent are well outside images of clip-outs bouncing up and down in stop-motion fashion. Besides having defining characteristics of quirky characters, subliminally bizarre set designs, and constant use of wide-angle lenses (particularly on close-ups or in dream sequences), he sets a new characteristic with Brazil that many directors attempt to live up to: being all-out fantastic. With his ability to capture imaginations as well as attention, it's hard to deny that ideology.If you seem unconvinced of Gilliam's talent, watch any film of his with DVD commentary. He points out for the audience almost every detail that no average filmmaker would ever notice after a hundred viewings. In 12 Monkeys, a time-travel sci-fi starring Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, Gilliam's avid attention-to-detail obsession is named ""The Hamster Factor."" In one scene of this particular film, there is a quick shot of Willis sitting in a chair, applying a shot to his arm. The shot was meant to be done in a quick take and be finished with. However, there is a hamster cage somewhere in the background, and Gilliam insisted the hamster had to spinning in his wheel during the take. The shot took 12 hours to complete. How this inept detail makes it masterwork, it's really hard to say.The Hamster Factor has its roots in, you guessed it, Brazil. There are tiny details that are spectacularly sparkled into the film's many layers, which can easily go unnoticed, but when noticed, only add to the greatness of it all. In one scene, in which Lowry approaches a mourning widow gazing wide-eyed out a window, a vivid reviewing of the scene shows that during the entire three-minute take while Lowry gives a speech to the woman, you notice the woman does not blink during the entire segment. How anyone is supposed to pick up on it without being pointed out, you tell me.If asked, in simple terms, what this film did for me, I would say that it simply proved to me Gilliam is an extraordinary filmmaker, no more, no less.",Brazil

274,His_Dudeness74,a vision of NOW !,9,2 February 2006,"This film seems more and more scarily prescient as the years go by - at the time it was released it was almost a little baffling and far-fetched, it now seems a frighteningly accurate vision of the 'future' not very far removed from our own present.Monty Python illustrator Terry Gilliam takes the audience into a frightening world, where terrorism is omniprescent - the terrorists are never shown, but things are blowing up left right and centre ... posters on street walls saying 'Watch that Parcel' - others offering 'high security holiday resorts' - the society depicted stoicly marches on, stunted and weighed down by endless red tape and petty beuracracy, and paranoid of each other ...The plot follows a beuracratic cock-up that precipitates the death of an innocent family man ... Drawn into this snowballing catastrophe is happily inconspicuous day-dreamer Sam Lowry (an excellent Johnathon Pryce), who over-steps his authority in order to help his inept boss. Lowry is hardly a hero, more of a petty pen-pusher, but when his outrageous daydreams of rescuing a blonde damsel in distress threaten to become reality after an encounter with a hard-nosed but sexy truck driver, he becomes obsessed and sets down a dangerous path.A great (and surprisingly) small role from Robert DeNiro as renegade heating engineer and Lowry's sometime ally, Harry Tuttle (the man that should have been eliminated by a government department, but for an administrative mistake), an insidious, creepy turn by Michael Palin as Sam's old friend Jack Lint and a simpering performance from Ian Holm as Sam's pathetic boss all combine to add plenty more layers of enjoyment to the film.Some of the effects are a bit dodgy, but some are great, and the movie has an almost 'Bladerunner' look to it at it's best. Gilliam has created a film here that's both very original and incredibly astute.some other clever bits * in the shoot-out finale/fantasy, a man is seen blowing up one of Tuttle's renegade squade via remote control in an unseen office by a man in a suit, foreshadowing warfare techniques decades away* Sam's plastic surgery addicted mother actually looks younger than her son by the end of the film !!",Brazil

285,david-dtn,Look beneath the surface,10,7 May 2007,"Well what can I say about Brazil. Dark, comedic, dsytopian, depressing, symbolic, and beautiful is only the beginning. Sam Lowry (Vincent Price) lives a meaningless existence as a drone worker for government information retrieval. His job is to collect and record information on every citizen living under the totalitarian rule of the state. He has the potential to progress within the company but prefers his mundane existence.Sam Lowry lives in a clockwork world run by accountants and government bureaucrats. They carry out orders with or without the consent of the public. Anyone who doesn't pay their taxes are hunted down and either shot or dealt with using psychological interrogation or brain manipulation.Things take a turn when his apartment develops some plumbing issues and a mix up with names in information retrieval causes him to question his life and the people he works for. A girl he sees in his dreams turns up at his job and we see that the mix up, the girl and a freelance plumber with rebellion on his mind (Robert De Niro) are all connected in some way. Only later when the plot develops we understand the intrinsic link between each plot device. The dream sequences are highly symbolic and their images represent Sams inner turmoil with his existence. We see later that they take a more sinister turn when he is interrogated and his dreams manipulated by his captors so that the viewer cant tell if what you see on screen is a dream or Sam Lowry's reality or indeed if Sams whole reality is in fact a dream.Brazil is very similar to 1984 and indeed borrows many of its ideas, the most noteworthy of which is the central big brother theme and the control of a totalitarian police state over its people. The retro future look is used once again possibly influences by 1984. The set-pieces and cinematography are outstanding and range from vast high rise neolithic apartment blocks to countless claustrophobic office cells. The most apparent difference between this and 1984 is the comedic twist inherent in almost every scene. Its rife with dark humor and takes an already serious subject matter seem superfluous and disjointed in places, almost like a dream (which is in effect what most of the film could be interpreted as) - however it works and Brazil uses its completely unique retro future look combining it with a quirky self depreciating humor that keeps the viewer entertained and engrossed. It is slow in parts and requires patience to digest the meanings and symbolic overtones but this gives it depth and so can be viewed multiple times as a result. Its a very unique film and possibly Terry Gilliams' best work and once again a theme that he later returns to in Twelve Monkeys.",Brazil
286,MrLankyD,Gilliam's a visual genius.,8,20 January 2002,"If anything else, you could just mute this film and stare at its beauty for two hours.  Director Terry Gilliam knows film is a visual medium, and knows how to tell a story by painting a picture. This film is dark, satirical, funny, scary, and surreal. I'm saving up for the sixty-dollar Crterion DVD boxed set. This film deserves such treatment, as its an underrated masterpiece looking at bureaucratic hell, where a misspelled name on a piece of paper results in an innocent man's death. Where paperwork is God, and man is slave to the corporate cog wheel.  Dilbert has nothing on Sam, whose only happiness lies in dreams. This is a very special and original film, and deserves to be watched in all of its colorful glory on dvd, where it can be done justice. Surprisingly for an eighties flick, it still looks great and holds up. Check it out, you'll be surprised at how incredible it is.:::::::::::::POSSIBLE SPOILER:::::::::::: P.S.

I must have watched it in the order of ten times since then and I'm still discovering new things here and there. This movie is not for everybody and even if it is for you, you should pick a time when you feel relaxed and alert. Don't even try if you were having a stressful day and don't want more than pure entertainment, because Brazil is definitely a whole lot more than just that. Brazil is quite a challenge to watch, it takes a sober and sharp intellect not to get lost in all of its subplots, but if you're up for it, you'll be in for a hell of a ride.

Gilliam pushes self-indulgence to the limit. Why is this a bad thing, though? Other directors, such as the Coen brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Brian De Palma, are endlessly praised for these excesses.What really strikes me about Brazil, though, is the relevance of it all. What once was a seemingly far-fetched dystopic future now has become real. Fear of terrorism has brought innumerable surveillance cameras monitoring our every move, Echelon monitoring global communications, renditions to prison camps for coercive interrogation, etc. We're living in the world of Brazil. Our lives are shaped by the whims of clueless incompetents like Kurtzmann and Helpmann, and if you make the wrong move - or perhaps become the hapless victim of a clerical error - you too could be facing the fate of Sam Lowry or Archibald Buttle.",Brazil
290,danielphillips97-251-836566,"Hilarious Satire, Existential Nightmare, Visionary Masterwork",10,11 December 2016,"Terry Gilliam's films are often battles, in the case of 'Brazil', Universal Studios, being led by Sid Sheinberg, wanted to change the film to make it more appealing for a commercial audience, but Gilliam resisted. Indeed, it was always meant as a cult film, with several people walking out during test screenings. Gilliam even went as far as to put up an ad saying ""Dear Sid Sheinberg, when are you going to release my film?"", and put up a photo of Sid Sheinberg on television to show everyone what he looked like, and showed illegal screenings to critics. He nearly had it entirely his way, although a dream sequence in which eyeballs stare up at Sam Lowry from the ground had to be deleted from the film. Perhaps it's Gilliam's uncompromising defiance that made it such a great film.In the tradition of Orwell's '1984' and the collected writings of Franz Kafka, 'Brazil' is a chilling dystopian sci-fi, a satire on bureaucracy, an existentialist horror in the guise of an absurdist farce, and a celebration of the imagination, which blends the comic, tragic, and visionary. It clearly comes out of the 'Monty Python' films, but is much darker, and leaves a powerful and lingering impression. Gilliam's vision is a vivid, bizarre, and madly inventive representation of a bureaucratic hell, which uses absurdity and black humor to portray an oppressive and frightening existence, yet this does not to lighten or diminish the films nightmarish horror, but rather makes it more plausible and multi- dimensional. These comical elements include a hilariously cramped office, chaotically disarrayed pipes and wires, and administrative errors. The protagonist is a dreamer, someone whose ideals are completely at odds with the oppressive world he's living in, and his dreams represent his explosive imagination breaking free of the shackles daily life imposes on him, yet always get impeded by the oppressive horror of Sam's existence, and turn into nightmares, with some truly strange, creepy, and sad imagery. If you find the film incoherent, than perhaps the whole thing's an impressionist nightmare, in which it's the fundamental images, feelings, and ideas that prevail.The final act is where the film takes a turn for the dark, sinister, and dangerous. It fuses symbols of childhood and innocence, with oppression and torture to chilling effect, such as masks of baby faces, and Santa Claus. It suggests that evil can come in the form of your best friend, a common family man, just ordinary people working for a bureaucratic system. It also features a gripping chase sequence, where you feel the options closing in on our doomed protagonist. The ambiguous and thought-provoking ending, while disturbing in a sense, is Gilliam's most definitive statement on imagination triumphing over reality. It will have people debating over whether it's tragic or triumphant, in a way I think it's a metaphor for what Terry Gilliam does for a living, creating gloriously imagined alternatives to our current reality. In fact, the whole film can be seen as an allegory on Gilliam's 'David and Goliath' battle with Universal Studios to get the film released the way he wanted, the small man against the big system.",Brazil

This is quite simply my favorite movie of all time and I'm too biased to write a review which will help you decide to watch it. I need of minimum of ten lines, so I'll tell you a few reasons that ""Brazil"" can not be topped. The plot is intricate and insane, and yet nor necessarily the most important aspect of the film. The setting, ""Somewhere in the Twentieth Century,"" is perfect. The insane sets should have garnered all possible Oscars. The duct work alone is genius, an odd touch that makes this an unreal time that somehow is timeless anyway. The performances are top-notch, down to the smallest parts. The overall look, the color palette, is consistently Gilliam and perfect. Jonathan Pryce is so good, you'd think all his movies would be better than any De Niro movie (so it must be Gilliam that got this performance out of him.) The dystopian society, especially the totalitarian but protective society and the constant, almost mere nuisance terrorism is prescient and somehow funny while being terrifying. How did he pull this off? Okay, all too congratulatory to be convincing. So here's some runners up: Blade Runner, Fight Club, The Godfather Part II, The Ruling Class, The Stuntman.",Brazil

I am no sissy but this movie scares me on so many levels, yet I am compelled to watch it every 5 years or so.

A lot of points that the director wanted to make, with some very good scenes used to make those points but just not tied together very well or very cohesively. I think it ran on about 25 minutes too long. Which is too bad. In general it seemed like a self-indulgent free-for-all and lacked the discipline to turn it into a real gem.

298,doctorrugger,The world without escape,10,1 November 2005,"One of the most recent commentators of the film has called it ""Gilliam's Manifesto"" : well, you can't be more accurate...There's a red herring in Gilliam's works, and that's the fight between the dreamy, irrational, fantasy-loving, aspects of everyone's personality and his mere rationality which, in Gilliam's vision, includes rational mind as well as basic physical needs (see his last Film Brother Grims).The almighty pipes and tubes that stuff Brazil's Society representation are not only pipes : there are bowels and tripes ! for the simple reason that society is not a concept, it's a human greedy body that always wants more, a body that confuses happiness and satiation. See how these pipes breath into the walls, how they gurgle ! No doubt that the whole town is a gigantic living organism . Now if you understand that your body is a part a small part of this macro-organism, a bit like in a anthill, you see why Sam Lowry has so many difficulties to get out of it.The 2 only solutions he can find are dream and ... madness.

The film is dark and complex and I believe has an underlying morality tale it is trying to convey to the viewer, but it was one I just wasn't interested in.

304,maeble,"Why Brazil is a better adaption than ""1984 (the movie)""",10,17 May 2005,"O.K. I personally think, that there are more than one way to translate a book into a movie.One is to take the whole books plot and squeeze it into 120 minutes of film. This will never work. What you'll get, is a movie, which fails to deliver the original message. (I found ""lord of the rings"" ridiculous for that reason) The result is, you have to cut scenes and obviously dialog....and there are some re-interpretations of scenes in order to get a better flow for the viewer. (Wich is not always a bad thing)Then there is the ""TV-movie way"". The TV-show claims to swallow every single plot and the greatest amount of dialog. The result is mostly a boring 6 hour long, something. ( Shining for example(the King version))There is however a third way to approach a book as a movie maker. And that is exactly what Gilliam did with Brazil. He took the novel ""1984"" and managed to transport the same ideas (and some of his own, for that matter), the same feelings, by developing a quite personal style (by adding humor for example). For me, this is the only true way of filming a novel. Why should i bother to see a book on the screen. Books, films and comics work on 3 different levels. Why forcing them in the boundaries of another.Movies where this worked well are:Brazil (Gilliam) The Shining (Kubrick) Naked Lunch (Cronenberg) Clockwork Orange (Kubrick) The Pledge (Penn) ...Movies where it didn't work were:Lord of the Rings Jackson) From hell (Hughes) and countless others ...",Brazil
305,someguy18_69,Number 6 is Number 1,8,22 December 2012,"1984 meets MONTY PYTHON. Terry Gilliam does the dystopia thing, with trademark excess making for uncomfortable laughs. Sam Lowry is a minor bureaucrat in a Big Brother state, unsatisfied with his lot in totalitarian hell. He escapes with romantic dreams ala Walter Mitty, escaping from everyday impotency by way of ego magnifications that cast him as conquering hero saving the damsel in distress. One day in the real world he happens to spot his fantasy woman and is compelled to defy the strictures of his grey, empty existence once & for all....But the story is as rote as the world depicted. The detail packed margins take several viewings to analyze properly for all their hilarious minutiae. This nightmare realm is the plot, a helter skelter texture, wheezing sub-par tech (despite taking place in the future) & utterly indifferent citizenry. I love this most of all- its portrayal of a compartmentalized, bovine populace that bats nary an eyelash whilst terrorist (false flag?) bombs go off in chic restaurants & menacing grunts kick down the door in the middle of the night. Nothing to see here, move along. They react like atrocities are inconvenient more than anything, accustomed to 24/7 sleepwalking which has let a monstrous inversion of everything we lip-service IRL as sacred encroach on their lives without mumbling a word. Broken, isolated, trapped in a Kafkaesque byzantine labyrinth of grey corridors and endless paperwork, retreating into grotesque STAR TREK:INSURRECTION face stretching vanity & fantasy worlds to escape soul sucking lack....sound like anyone we know?Our weasely protagonist is certainly no Winston Smith either, keeping the horrors of his world at an arm's distance & dreaming of faraway lands un-oppressed by modern life. His is no quest to decipher the whys & how's of Big Brother, just lay the fantasy chick; in 1984 that was incidental, here escape is literally defined as running into the arms of a willing woman. Sam pushes himself into a disastrous stab at saving the darling damsel yet in contrast to his comic book fantasy proves pathetically impotent, destroying other lives in addition to his own. The mutual salve of human comfort is meaningless in a world where the personal has become political. If there's a movie to prove the brain- washing 'romance' of Hollywood the sham it is, its BRAZIL. Trying to get laid when the world is burning down certainly isn't going to put the blaze out.Truly though, this is a 2nd hand future little Georgie Lucas would drool over, everything pointlessly amped up to the 9th degree, a maze of wheezing, malfunctioning machinery & petty bureaucrats abusing the small say-so allotted them. Bystanders attempt to live terrorized lives while the state clumsily pounces round with well meaning storm troopers & well-spoken tyrants asking you politely to sign on the dotted line (everyone here is sooo polite despite the terrible things they do).I wouldn't have actually thought such a world possible until recently, confirming that yes indeed, people will let the organs of state extend around their squirming bodies if it means more comfort.

309,werner-11,Brazil - What else?,10,16 December 1999,"Did you ever ask yourself why the film is called ""Brazil"". I'll give you an answer which could be right. Brazil is the song named which Sam Lowry is listening to when he is driving away from his ""metropolis"" into the more rural area. For me Brazil is synonymous with perhaps ""freedom"", ""longing"" or ""desire"". Though Sam is living in a system (just a symbol for a system)in which he was born (he couldn't do anything against it just like you and me) he doesn't like it, it's boring. The people there, they just live like everyday's people, working for this meaningless system which is so absurdly drawn. Their living is meaningless. Nobody really likes to be there because the system is so unreal and very misanthropic. Everybody is ""arrested"" in this system. People don't really live in this system, they rather vegetate. No, Sam Lowry wants to get out of this system - even of his reality. The opposite of reality for me is s.th like a dream. Mr. Lowry too, he is dreaming, dreaming to be free, free as bird. In his dreams he's flying like a big bird. It's a human with wings, a human who's flying? Here his impossible longings are shown. Even in his body he's arrested, another kind of a system. He's no bird, he's a mere human, who doesn't want to be one. No, he wants to be free as a flying bird, he wants true feelings, he wants love (the scene when the woman in his dreams calls him, he wants to get to his true love, but then the gigantic walls of the system appear( human made, no natural obstacles )and so he can't do what he wants to do) His only solution is to get out of this systematic world. Every time when these things happen, when he has surrealistic dreams of love and freedom, when he's getting away from the cold system of reality, the song or the theme ""Brazil"" is heard.As well in the very end of the film, when he gets away from his tormentors (""We've lost him""), he is getting out of another system - the system of being alive. Again the Brazil - theme shows its meaning, it's Sam Lowry's hymn - of getting away from everything what restricts him. What name would you have given to the film?Werner Keller ( My grand-father has stolen a dutch bike )",Brazil

313,brooke-roberson,Reality and Fantasy,10,30 November 2016,"This review does contain a spoiler to the ending! Please watch the movie Brazil before reading this review! Enjoy! Reality and Fantasy these concepts are heavy themes in the movie Brazil (just look at the film's poster artwork!). Cross-references are predominant at critical shifts. One example is when Sam leaves Jill's apartment and the word REALITY is graffitied in the ally. This at the same time the fantasy theme music ""Brazil"" can be heard playing over the radio in his car. This is clue to the audience, telling us we must be careful what we believe is truly going on. This fight between fantasy and reality on screen is sometimes called ""magical realism."" This is how director Terry Gillian chose to describe the film given it presumably takes place in our real world but with everything imagined so differently. The world as it would look under an oppressive, secretive government.In most dystopia films the hero tends to believe in his fantasies of a better life so powerfully that it launches him to combat his reality. It's that fantasy that gives him the courage to become a hero. This is nowhere more true than in Sam. His life is so out of balance that he often will voluntarily gets lost in his fantasy of flying high in the clouds where he meets a beautiful woman. This is true for some people, although it tends to go by the term, Delusion. I often wonder, If you sit in your bed for hours and dream about your fantasies, then is it true that your fantasy is your reality for the time you spend sitting there? Fantasy & reality, the cycle of life and death, and the concept that life is just a dream are fundamental ideas in most secret societies. The Ministry of Information is a type of secret society. The symbols of secret societies are often in plain view and will reveal many truths to those who are inducted into the society, or those who are able to analyze the messages themselves. I believe the shape of the letter ""i"" is indicative of two things. One, it's a cross-reference to the ""all seeing 'eye'"" and two, its in the shape of a coffin. The information that differentiates us from animals, the knowledge of our own death.Sam's dreams are his way of escaping his reality. If he consumes himself in his fantasy long enough then in essence that becomes his reality and the horrific presence the Ministry plays in his life. This is true in the final torture scene as well. He checks out of the real world and fantasizes what he would have liked to have had happened. This is how he escapes the pain of his torture. but even that fantasy crumples apart into a nightmare.Gillian also pays attention to the different ways people observe their fantasies. Sam's mother, for example, fantasizes about being young and has every plastic surgery she can to maintain a ""youthful"" appearance. She is actually truly altering her appearance. She looks in the mirror and is so satisfied, but is she really beautiful? And again, some people do this only it tends to be called Body Dysmorphia. But this is true for Sam too. In his fantasy himself and Jill are both much more good looking then they actually are.",Brazil
314,master_dark4dune,Brazil,10,20 September 2007,"After Time Bandits, Gilliam has directed an much more visually stunning and exciting film. For adults mind. Brazil follows a similar story to Orwell's 1984 where the society in which people live is bizarre, scary and full of paper work. Here Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowry, and with the help of a great cast and Gilliam's oversee, he plays someone who wishes to escape from the totalitarian society that he works for.Each seen is watchable with the dazzling effects and sets and parts really do have you laughing and getting scared. And to me, it's amazing, and after a full ten years of having The Empire Strikes Back as my favourite film, this little gem came along and snapped up that title. Terry Gilliam deserves all the credit he can muster as well as each actor who took part.",Brazil
315,car-nune,One of the top ten films of all times,10,29 March 2005,"Brazil is definitively one of the top ten movies of all times. Its a sort of anti-Utopian spectacle, in the same fashion of George Orwell's 1984. The movie has a very complex sequence of events, which require more than one viewing for full understanding. In fact, the first time i saw Brazil, i didn't enjoy it much. But then i gave it a second chance, and the pleasure of watching it increased exponentially. The more I watch it, the more I discover hidden aspects and new ways to interpret this masterful creation. The scenario is extraordinary, mixing long pipe lines and a almost omnipresent Gothic atmosphere. If you didn't like the movie the first time you saw it, don't be by any means discouraged. This movie requires patience and an active role from the viewer. Finally, Brazil deserves special praise for all the dream-like sequences of the main character and the music fits in perfectly well.",Brazil
316,rootieboy,Brazil-Where We Are Headed,10,4 December 2008,"Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June We stood beneath an amber moon And softly whispered, ""Someday soon"" We kissed and clung together Then - tomorrow was another day The morning found us miles away With still a million things to say And now, the twilight moves the skies above Recalling thrills of our love There's one thing I'm certain of Return, I will, to old BrazilThe movie Brazil does not take place in the country of Brazil. In fact Brazil is only mentioned in the song written above which is played numerous times throughout the movie. Why then is the movie called Brazil? It is a far away land from the twisted government and the run down world that the characters in this movie live in. The song lyrics give hope for an escape to paradise. A dreamland that is real.Sam Lowery is a dreamer himself. He has only one dream, to find the woman of his dreams. How does he escape from his life and into his fantasies? How does he make his dreams a reality? He gives up everything that makes him feel secure: his job, his apartment, and even the rules. The most important thing that he gives up is the paper work. In his world he learns a life without paper work is free life.Sam Lowery is played by Jonathan Pryce. In order to help the audience relate to this character he was written as an unconfident clumsy day dreamer. He is the average man in an oppressed society. Pryce's performance was dead on. You feel sorry for him because he accidentally makes decisions that pull him into dangerous situations. He is jittery, nervous and paranoid. In his dreams he is a hero. He flies around with wings and wears metal armor. He is a romantic warrior. He is the perfect man that every woman dreams of. He is what every man dreams he could be.This film has a wide range of acting talents: Ian Holm who plays Sam Lowery's cowardly boss, Robert De Niro who plays a rebel heating engineer stealing jobs from the government, Bob Hoskins who plays a government heating engineer restricted by paper work., Jim Broadbent plays a high society plastic sergeant, Katharine Helmond plays the ever image changing mother of Sam, and Kim Griest is both the lovely girl in Sam's dreams and a rough feminist trucker in the real world. Some cast members loved the script so much they didn't care what role they would be given just as long as they were in the film.The Director of Brazil is Terry Gilliam. He has a style that no other director can match. He has created a future where technology has failed us. It is a dirty future where people have forgotten what true happiness is. The government has convinced the people that the way they live is the right way. Gilliam has created a true dystopian society.Gilliam decided to put offices in closet size rooms with concrete walls littered with posters that promote ""Anti Trust."" The walls and ceilings of the buildings are lined with hundreds of ducts. The city is littered with paper. He creates a true separation between the architecture of the rich and that of the poor. It gives the feeling that you are not in control of your own life. The towering ceilings make you feel that there is no way out. He chose locations that included, London's Dockland, a south London power station, a Kent oil refinery and the Paris d'Abraxis apartment complex in suburban Paris.It is a suit and hat world. Most of the rich characters are dressed as if they were from the 40's. High society resembles that of old Hollywood even though the story takes place in the near future. Dressing people in this fashion helps the story very much. It was almost as if we ere moving backwards as a society. The surroundings take control over ones life and they are less encouraged to make decisions for themselves. The production quality is definitely one of the strongest I have seen in a film. So much detail went into making a realistic future, not a science fiction future.I must warn the reader that I watched the movie three times before I realized how brilliant it actually was. In fact, I have learned that many people do not understand the point of the movie and will turn it off half way through. If you do not endure to the end of Brazil you will miss out on an incredible experience and what I believe is the most thought provoking ending",Brazil

His mother reminds me of my classmates: just thinking about boys and looking good. The Dinner scene I could frightfully relate to: having to sit there and listen to pointless conversation. I also found the almost last scene difficult to watch. Terri Gillian is a great movie-maker; he also impressed me with ""Time Bandits"". The title of the movie is token from the theme song.

The only problem with the film is that it's very difficult to describe,and many people more aquainted with more mainstream film's will probably hate it,mainly because of it's offbeat,not to mention downbeat tone. This film's got to be up there with seven and arlington road as having one of the most downbeat ending's seen in a mainstream film. Much to the dismay of the film's distributor universal,who not only demanded gilliam cut a hefty 50 minute's out of the film's 2hrs 20 mins runing time but also change the ending to a happy,more commercial ending. The studio totaly missed the point of the film. Because of it's odd,hard to define subject matter,it remain's a very underrated film,gaining a small but loving cult following.

It is a great premise that a swat of a fly can trigger such a mad-cap domino effect on one man's life.

Lifestyles thwarted by checks and balances against a very grey view of what is right and what is wrong. There is a confusion wrung to wretched life in Sam Lowry's attempts to live and work in an age where hitlerism has never really died, but grown more insidious and instilled into people's lives.It's a story about one cog named Sam Lowry who is firmly locked into the wheel of every day dreary life. He is trying to break free from the monotony and re-take the very idea of having fun again, it seems. In the course of tracking his life-changing events we get to see, in an extreme fashion, the collective danger when everyone just 'follows orders' and blindly adheres to a code of conduct that in of itself might be morally repugnant. But there's so much more to the movie, with hidden messages and analogies everywhere.But there is no single epiphany here; just cold and empty possibilities attempting to break down our pre-conditioning to convey a message. The message, if only one, will still be different for each of us. Which means, you can't miss this one, you need to watch it. This is life distilled from the forests for each of the individual trees that make up that forest. Don't miss it.",Brazil
326,alertubella,"Greatest work of Gilliam, one of the greatest films ever",10,14 September 2011,"I love Terry Gilliam's films: the stories, the visuals, the acid and cynic humor... And in his filmography, this is definitely his best film, and one of my personal top 5.Gilliam gets inspired in Orwell's 1984 universe and creates a world where the individuality is reduced to nothing. This is a decaying universe, where the powers at hand have become experts at mass manipulation, and where those who question the norm are pursued. OK, this brings nothing new: Orwell, Huxley and many others have warned us about these dangers for a a future society. The twist by Gilliam is that he manages to describe all this with a very particular humor, so that you find yourself laughing at what in fact are very sad and cruel situations. He uses humor to make an extremely acid critic and it becomes obvious that what is described in Brazil is not THAT far from our own society, that we are only a few steps away from a manipulative police state (hey, and America's war on terror had not even started!)The visuals in this film, as always with Terry Gilliam are stunning. He creates something that looks like a parallel universe mixing time and technology, so that it looks like an old fashioned future, if such thing can be.Actors are doing a great job. Jonathan Price is excellent, and the small roles of Robert De Niro and Bob Hoskins are plainly hilarious.I have seen this film many times and it always brings something new and it resists beautifully the passage of time. If anything, the message he renders is more an issue of today than it was in 1985.Of course, to fully enjoy this film you must have an open mind and some liking for sci-fi and the fantastic, but to me it is already a classic cult film.",Brazil

This movie is like a song that people interpret their own powerful message only to have the songwriter reveal that the song was about rolling down to the Cinnabon to get a cinnamon roll. There isn't really any point in poking holes in the plot as it contains nothing but holes and there isn't any way to apply logic or reason to the actions of any of the characters.

335,debraj1,Shades of Chaplin,8,24 November 2002,"<possible spoilers>Some have said that the plot is hard to follow. That should not deter anyone who enjoys satire. There are plenty of images to delight the repeat viewer.
Jonathan Pryce plays Sam Lowry, a bureaucrat caught in a nightmare world of paranoia, storm troopers, and technology that dosen't work. His world is one of desperate hopelessness, which he escapes through an image of a fantasy woman (Kim Grist), until circumstances allow Sam to pursue her for real.
The images are the key to enjoying Brazil. There are plenty. Billboards hide the barren landscape, absolutely nothing can be done without the proper form (properly stamped), and Public Enemy #1 is a heating engineer(Robert De Niro) who commits the unforgiveable sin of fixing things.
There were several versions made, including a 90 minute ""happy ending"" version, which in my opinion ruins the tone of the film. There is a strong surreal quality to the film, but viewers will have no trouble appreciating the gross parody of modern bureaucracy and paranoia.I couldn't help noting that this film gets better with age. In an early scene, office workers watch television while the boss isn't looking, not unlike today's unauthorized Internet surfing. Brazil may actually be more prophetic than Orwell's 1984.

The story concerns Sam Lowrey, a lowly government employee who receives a routine assignment to investigate a routine screw-up that occurred when the police tracked down a supposed anarchist. Rather than terminating a renegade plumber named Harry Tuttle, they killed an innocent family man of the unfortunately similar name ""Archie Buttle"". As Lowrey investigates this mistake, he befriends Tuttle, falls in love with a renegade named Jill, and falls afoul of the totalitarian government he serves. This film, though dark, is full of wondrous moments and jokes, including Sam's mother's constant attempts to get her son a promotion and to set him up with a friend's brace-face daughter. Michael Palin, one of Gilliam's fellow Pythons also does brilliant work as Sam's interrogator friend, whose job (which borders on butchery most of the time) doesn't affect his happiness at all.

342,Kee_Nim_Mak_Mak,"Vast, dark, beautiful, mysterious... Welcome to Brazil",10,11 October 2008,"Alan Moore, writer of V for Vendetta, claims that most of science fiction's future worlds are exaggerated takes on the present - social commentaries, given room to breathe. With this in mind few future worlds are as prescient as Brazil's. Gillian's neon-soaked world of office-bound worker drones, apathy, and the loss of freedom in the face of a terrorist threat is an almost eerie reflection of the current state of our world - 1984 with its tongue wedged firmly in its cheek.Johnathan Pryce, in a role tellingly written for him, is Sam Lowry, a long-suffering everyman dealing with problems not too dissimilar to our own - unreliable technology, feelings of worthlessness and anonymity, a dead-end job, the desires and demands of his mother. In dreams, however, he's a heroic white knight, pursuing a beautiful veiled woman through ever increasing obstacles. A chance encounter with the woman in the real world (played by Kim Greist) leads him to attempt to break out of his tedious day-to-day life - but reality proves to be a deadly barrier and his pursuit soon spirals dangerously out of control.As in all the best satires, Gillian's film is less laugh-out-loud funny than it is absurdly tragic, steadily walking the dangerous line between farce and drama that in the hands of a lesser director would have seen the film degenerate into an uncertain mess. Moments of genuine chilling emotion are juxtaposed with the darkest comedy to make them, if anything, even more potent.And yet the plot forms nothing but the merest of bones to the Brazil experience (and it is an experience). It is, all hyperbole aside, one of the most striking, incredible-looking works in cinema history. There are scenes that will remain branded permanently in your mind forever. A strip of thirties-style billboards walling up a highway and, as the camera reveals, concealing flame-scorched oilfields. Vast filing-cabinet apartment blocks. Neon-drenched glass-and-marble shopping centres. Brazil is a work of art, in which one can almost switch off the plot entirely and drown in the sumptuous visuals. Much like Monty Python, the imagery is often surreal, dark and funny - torturers in baby-masks, samurais made up of electronic components. Brazil is less a vision of the future and more a nightmarish take on the 20th century, in all its bleak industrial glory.Problems, then? Kim Greist, as the object of Lowry's affections, puts in a fairly weak performance. But that's about it.Brazil is truly an astounding work, and a must-see not just for lovers of sci-fi or cinema - it's an indulgent, plush epic, a treat for the senses that stimulates on many levels. At times both hilarious and terrifying, farcical and thought-provoking, it is a barbed commentary on our contemporary world, and a definite sci-fi classic.",Brazil
343,chris-jones1991,Brazil (1985):Ideologies,9,20 November 2012,"Terry Gillian's fourth directorial effort stars Jonathan Pryce in a dystopian future based around information acquisition. The plot revolves around Pryce's attempts to correct an administrative error and find quite literally the girl of his dreams. Although Brazil can be and is often tagged as a black comedy this only serves to deceive us from the ideological messages at play. First of all the film acknowledges probably the greatest threat to 1980s Britain the IRA's bombing campaign in retaliation to Bloody Sunday in 1972. Brazil was released 13 years after and is referenced by a character in a news report: ""The bombing Campaign is now in its thirteenth year"". This can be directly perceived as a nod to the real life terrorist attacks. However an ideology is presented through the ideological state apparatus of television by the senior authority figure of Mr. Helpmann trying down play the terrorist attacks as nothing more than bad sportsmanship. Therefore implying that television is a means for which the public can be deceived by those in power; the media makes people powerful, implying that politicians and authority figures lie to you. However the greatest influence on the films plot has to be the ideologies taken from Orwell's 1984. That is the idea of a nightmare future where no one is free and everything revolves around administration and paperwork. The way the numerous administration departments rely on unreliable machines which are a cross between typewriters and computers could be perceived as warning not to over rely on technology.However the film effectively tries to subvert the ideology of everyone following strict rules through its primary protagonist, Sam Lowry. This is conveyed to the audience through his spontaneous dreams where Lowry can escape the monotony of the system and life's difficulties, he dreams of his ideal existence and girl of his dreams. Possibly creating a sense of hegemony for Lowry where there is more to life than record keeping and information storage. This plays on the belief that our mind is separate from our body following a duellist belief, opposing Helpmann's reference to 'the ghost in the machine'.The verbal rhetoric is arguably the greatest asset in voicing the film's ideologies. A particular example being an engraving on a statue ""The Truth shall make you free"" as well as the repeating of the phrase ""where all in this together"" further enforcing the notion that the future will be administrative nightmare where everyone is oppressed. However once you realise this you can try to escape it linking back to how people in the film are deceived into living a certain way, they do nothing to change because they are duped into believing that their existence is perfect.Brazil may be overlong but presents some very strong ideologies courtesy of George Orwell's 1984; the look of the film being heavily influenced by 1940s perceptions of what the 1980s would be like. Gillian gives us an effective film which presents an apparently efficient but bleak vision of the future. The audience ultimately presented with the ideology that they should be radical and break away from conformity despite the consequences.",Brazil

There is comedy. There is tragedy. There is love. There is Robert De Niro as a terrorist plumber. There is a story, which moves along in unexpected ways. There are dream sequences which play with your mind.The dystopia illustrated in this movie is total; everything is old, dirty and inefficient, except for the bureaucracy, which is excelling at producing work and justifications for itself and terror and bills for the people, who can only pay the bills and suffer the pains.Love is what makes the one that cannot fit in try to burst out of the system and he chases his dream with total disregard for his surroundings, and the result is the disaster one hopes would not be coming, but it has never been more certain to end in tragedy.We share his hope for a bright ending, and so we are crushed at the end, but he has escaped...The music is perfect.",Brazil
345,lowrysamuel4,A valuable experience,8,19 March 2014,"Despite many negative reviews, even Ebert didn't like it too much at the time, I think this is the type of film that really stands the test of time. I feel that, while pleasant the story, the message is so much higher than just a dystopian warning. beuaraucratic oppression is staring you right in the face during the entire picture. You cannot ignore it. The atmosphere, set, and costumes are much more important than the story itself. While well acted and thought out, Gilliam is really trying talk about what is wrong with society at the present, and predict what will happen at this rate. It can be compared to 1984, but I believe that any story can be transcribed to film, but that does not mean that they are the same entities, these are two person's views and ideas. Was Gilliam influences by 1984? Possibly, but that isn't the point, its the experience taken from this picture that is what's important. I really left the picture with the idea to treat every human as an individual as oppose to a number like the film. What a lovely experience",Brazil
346,charliedoble,A Review of Brazil (1985),10,30 September 2016,"Brazil is not a film for everybody. Upon its initial release many critics hated it, and it didn't do very well financially. I've read plenty of the reviews for the film and a lot of the issues they had are perfectly understandable. The dream sequences do get slightly tedious and don't develop the story, the action sequences aren't that great and it is a rather long film (two hours and thirteen minutes). I agree wholeheartedly that the film has problems. So why is it my favourite film of all time? Well, I think it has to do with preferences, like most movies. I love dark comedy and surreal imagery. I also really like satire and find it to be extremely funny (when its done right). So Brazil seems like the perfect film for me. Have you ever seen a movie that seems like it was tailor made for you? Well, that's Brazil for me. The film is directed brilliantly by Terry Gilliam, and stars Jonathan Pryce, Robert DeNiro, Bob Hoskins and an abundance of other actors and actresses. Every single person does a brilliant job, and I can't think of a single person who's bad in it. The set design is absolutely incredible. The matte paintings and sets look great, and really bring the world of Brazil to life. The film also has one of the most underrated scores of all time, by Michael Kamen. The music used in the office near the start has been used in countless other movies and movie trailers. The cinematography is also beautiful. The film has, in my opinion, one of the greatest endings of all time. It shows you your happy ending and then completely destroys it right in front of you. Its a great twist ending.As for flaws, there are a few. Most of them I talked about near the start of the review, but there is another one I want to talk about. The editing is sometimes slightly off and it feels like they end scenes too early, or chopped some of the endings of scenes off to save time (that flaw is fairly minor and not many people will notice it). Despite its flaws, Brazil is still my favourite movie of all time and always will be. Sure, its got problems, but I think its better that way. Nothing is perfect no matter how much you want it to be, and if there is (supposedly) nothing wrong with a film, or book or any type of art, it makes it seem less human, and in being perfect makes you appreciate it less. That's my take on it anyway.",Brazil

348,tom1978,as Gilliam as it gets,8,8 August 2006,"Trying to put Brazil into a certain genre is hard to do, probably even impossible. So i won't try. This movie is hilariously funny and utterly creepy at the same time, it'retro-futuristic and an ironic view of the times we live in, it's a love story with a sad ending, it's political satire without a single politician in it, it's slapstick comedy with torture, it's women wearing shoes on their heads and terrorism, it's plastic surgery and an LSD-trip like funeral... to put it all in other words: it's Terry Gilliam's take on Orwell's ""1984"" (sortof....plus of course a guerrilla heating technician; ninja style!).But if you're expecting to just get ""1984"" mixed into a bit of Monty Python's bizarro-world, you will be disappointed: you wont get the ""trademarks"" of neither of them. No pointless jokes like the ""silly walks"", and no warning words for the future printed in bold, capital letters either. What you get with ""Brazil"" is a visually very clever (and partially even stunning) movie, that might leave you a bit lost when the credits start to roll. I don't think that's a bad thing, quite the opposite actually. Brazil is one of the few movies that defies all categorization, that is thought provoking and laugh-out-loud funny at the same time. Don't miss this gem! Although i can see why Brazil doesn't appeal to everyone (the wild genre-mix sure isn't everybody's taste), i highly recommend you at least give it a try some time, if you haven't seen it yet. Oh, and make sure you get the version with the original ending, not the butchered ""happy ending"".",Brazil
349,skii156,The most important film ive ever seen,10,5 January 2000,"Yep, THE most important film I've ever seen, not the best, but this film holds pride of place in my life as it actually inspired me to change it, I kid you not. A film about dreams and how reality turns them into despair, about what happens when life doesn't give you a helping hand as much as a helpful kick. I empathised so much with the character of Sam that it made me think about my life and what i was doing with it. It gave me the little piece of impetuous to quit my paper-work infested job and travel around the world. Which is why years later I'm now in full time education trying to make something of my shot at life. Now I'm not saying that this is all down to 'Brazil' but when I look backwards it's just after watching this film that I began to change. Terry Gilliam had to fight tooth and nail to let the Hollywood studios release this film (they hated the ending), I for one am glad that he fought so hard. Watch this film and I hope that it has a similar effect on you.",Brazil
350,bmmello,Gilliam's best film,10,7 March 2003,"Brazil is quite simply Terry Gilliam's best film. And from the great director that gave us brilliant films like ""Time Bandits"", ""The Twelve Monkeys"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" this means that Brazil is awesome. A great cast with superb performances (especially Jonathan Pryce, Robert DeNiro, Ian Holm and Michael Palin) is matched with a powerful story and great art / set direction. The score by Michael Kamen also shines.However, be careful not to watch the ""Love conquers all"" version of Brazil. It was edited roughly an hour from the original version. This version, while may be interesting to watch after seeing Gilliam's version, must be avoided.My rating: 10/10",Brazil

352,thomas-102,Nightmare World or What,10,1 July 2001,"I Love this film.It really is a fine example of film.The plot is excellent and the cast are superb.Somewhere in the 20th century (It opens with that line)a man kills a fly, it drops into a machine doing the records of criminal activity and changes one Mr Tuttle to Mr Buttle.This causes him to be taken away on christmas.The scene where they take him is disturbing in its own way as you know they've got the wrong man.This causes a bureacrat to investigate.That is the plot just about but its excellent. The city where all this takes place is a dystopian city everything is controlled by one very mysterious government.The film kind of focuses on how easy mistakes can be made and how people dont act quick enough to fix them.Really its a dark satire in a way but does not feel like it.Sam Lowry is the investigator hes a dreamer he daydreams of being a flying man souring through the air of Xavier Cougats 'Brazil'.everything that happens to our hero turns up as an obstacle in his dreams.The film is typical Terry Gilliam sort of a monty python sketch with a sci-fi twist.The film is excellently directed the dream sequences standout alot especially the scene where our hero is fighting the 20 foot samuri warrior in one of his dreams.That scene is superb.every time a dream happens and he fights an enemy he destroys part of himself in the process.There are other elements to this film aswell as a terrorist organisation is going around planting bombs and when they explode they havoc an example is in a restaurant one goes off while Sam and his youth obsessed mother are having a meal it explodes a couple of tables next to them a waiter goes and puts a slide where there sitting.His mother is completely oblivious to bomb being set off they continue to eat.The leader of this organisation is Mr Harry Tuttle the man should really be dead but he is not.He is another would be hero to challenge Lowry.The cast is excellent.Jonathan pryce is brilliant as Sam Lowry one of his best roles and it just shows he really is an underated actor.Robert De niro is Harry Tuttle and plays it fine but is somehow underused in all of this he appears on the scene to help Lowry with his house which is falling apart and the two mechanics one of them by Bob Hoskins wont fix it.Yet again anther satirical touch.Ian Holm,Ian Richardson are like company heads they play there parts excellently.Michael Palin plays a kind of Baddie in all of this.Eventually the dreams of Lowry take over him..........The film is excellent first chance you get see it.A Modern classic!!!!!!!!!",Brazil

Being charged for the cost of interrogation...classic. Payment plans etc. The concept of somewhere in the 20th century is so perfectly brought to life in this film.A few items I was unsure of.A couple of times it was alluded to that Sam was being followed especially the scene where he went to return the check to Mrs Buttle. I wonder if this was an unexplored plot line?A movie this visual and complicated I don't know what was trying to be achieved with the final dream sequence. Especially his mother/wife at the church.

Stupid stupid movie! Even after watching I still can't really explain what is about. I guess the English have a very different taste for movies. I have only written a few reviews but this one was so bad that I just had to write about it.

Most intelligent people will understand what is going on. They used a lot of details to convey lots of information. This movie certainly can be frightening and bizarre as well, since a lot of what it says can in many ways be translated to the real world. An excellent commentary on the absurdity of modern city life.",Brazil
357,JackLint,Perhaps the greatest of all films,10,18 October 2002,"I have read a lot of understandably negative reviews of the movie 'Brazil.' Brazil(in its proper form) is a long film at well over two hours, it has many cutaways to dream sequences that are only loosely related to the rest of the film, and the narrative story is not always the driving force of the film which many people find confusing.  With all these things going against it, Brazil is clearly not a film for everyone.All that being said, Brazil is my very favorite movie.  Those things previously described as reasons that some people will dislike the movie are the very reasons I love it.  The story is both simple and complex depending on how you look at it, and this kind of paradox is what makes for great art. There, I did it!  I used the 'A' word, and not lightly.  Brazil is an art film, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Sam Lowry(Jonathan Pryce) is our hero, an unambitious bureaucrat within the ranks of the Ministry of Information.  The only place he is willing to be more than a drone is in his dreams where he is some sort of angelic knight fighting to save his dream girl.  While running an errand for work, Sam comes face to face with a woman who is the very image of the dream girl, and his life is forever changed when he surrenders his tranquil unambitious life in the attempt to pursue the woman.This movie is less about the story than it is about the atmosphere in my opinion.  Terry Gilliam is a visual genius, and this movie marks his peak(so far) in producing a visually stunning film, with due apologies to Adventures of Baron Munchausen and 12 Monkeys which are beautiful in their own rights. The oppression of the bureaucratic life is felt by anyone who watches this film, and the freedom experienced in the dreams is a fantastic counterpoint. This film does a wonderful job of evoking emotional responses for me, and I suspect for most of the fans of the film as well.The film can be viewed at many different levels of complexity, from fairly simple to fully allegorical.  The simple view would be that the movie is about the dreams we create to escape our dull lives, and the potentially disastrous results of pursuing them in waking life.  Symbolically the film can be interpreted as a vicious attack on the status quo as an impersonal, consumer/beauty oriented beast that is upheld by a draconian adherence to regulations and invasive public policy.  There are many other ways to see it, most of which are probably unintended, but certainly completely valid.The best part about Brazil is that it is absolutely hilarious.  Jonathan Pryce shows remarkable aptitude for physical comedy.  The dialogue is as funny as any movie you'll ever see, though the humor is very dry, and often so subtle that you might not get a joke until a minute after it has passed. There are the occasional tidbits of out loud guffaws one would expect from a script that was partly written by Tom Stoppard, but there is not a constant barrage of this material.Brazil is a very cerebral film, so if you are thinking, ""What does cerebral mean?"" you can probably skip it.  Anyone who expects to have a story clearly spelled out for them, and done so in a concise manner with little background interference will hate Brazil.  Brazil is a film for those who want texture, emotional involvement and some sort of deeper meaning.Brazil is my favorite movie, but it is clearly not for everyone!",Brazil

359,ergo2497,A Darkly Humorous Vision,10,14 March 2005,"""Brazil"" is easily one of my favorite films of all time, enough that I bought the sixty-dollar Criterion Collection version of the film, with its 'final cut' of Gilliam's masterpiece at its proper running time at 2 hrs and 22 minutes.It's the story of one rather passive, meek man named Sam Lowry whose dreams literally soar far beyond the dull and dreary world he lives in, and his struggle to realize a part of that dream.Simply put, Brazil has a great deal of everything interesting in movies. There's dark comedy, satire to spare, drama, intrigue, mystery, sci-fi. It's a throwback to film noir as much as Orwell, what with Sam's trench coat and fedora and the dark, grainy look of certain scenes. Golden Age German cinema is also a clear inspiration, considering many of the bizarre angles and the way the architectural style bears a certain resemblance to that of ""Metropolis"".But one of the most special things about ""Brazil"" is that it defies typification. It manages to blend humor, awe and terror in equal measure, consistently taking your breath away while leaving you gasping for air in order to laugh. It depicts a world full of bureaucracy, technology and consumerism run amok, one which clearly parallels our world today. It's film as dream and nightmare, surreal yet somehow plausible.Where ""Brazil"" really shines is in the quirky, savagely satirical details, like when you see a parade of the ""Consumers for Christ"", or the way everyone refuses to use the word ""dead"", preferring to resort to an endless stream of politically correct synonyms. Ditto for the subplots, including an especially relevant swat at plastic surgery, as well as a riotously funny battle between a rebel and the system waged through the heating system of Sam's flat.Most importantly, however, the film does have meaning, much more than the drastically simplified assumption that Gilliam is simply channeling Orwell. Top all this off with some daring ambiguity and you have an instant masterpiece.",Brazil

362,ijazahmadaqsa,"Entertaining, Informative and Thought Provoking - A Must See",9,30 September 2014,"Note: This review may contain spoilers but I've been very vague and non-specific.This film merges some Huxleyan ideas well with some twists to the more common and prevalent Orwellian views of the world. Gilliam really paints a fantastic futuristic world bogged down by bureaucracy and political intrigue. While Orwell constantly paints a world of an outside threat that kept the proletarian and party members in line, Huxley painted a world where individual freedom was not cared or sought after because they (the populace) were led to believe their future had already been perfected and the only threat to their person was non-conformity. The Orwellian view of a bureaucratic nightmare is mixed well with a Huxleyan threat of unrestricted personal investment and non- conformity within the society as opposed to restricted and checked personal ambition, which the former, in the end served to bring about Sam's end. In a world where the person must restrict his personal needs, wants and rights (remember SUSPICION BREEDS CONFIDENCE) for the greater good of a bureaucracy that is working for the people because of an unmitigated and constant threat; Gilliam has harmonized these two world views into a masterpiece. At least, that is how I view it.The world's design, colours and music brings to life a very brutalist world that otherwise would seem dark and depressing. Freedom of thought or having the ability to think for one's self in this world is shied upon, while monitoring or being suspicious of others seems to be encouraged if not a foremost priority of the state itself. This movie raises important questions about the role and function of government, the purpose of free thought and throws into that mix, the issues of unrestricted ambition and its subsequent perils.Without a doubt, you can watch this movie for just entertainment and you will be entertained. Be warned though, if you watch it once, the movie will captivate you. There will be a second or third viewing, and with each new viewing, you'll discover something new, something interesting, something beautiful. It's a must see.",Brazil

372,gramdal,A Cerebral Blow-out,10,16 July 2007,"One of the top 10 movies of all time, in my book. I would call this the Citizen Kane of my generation (Baby Boomer/X).This is easily Gilliams best work.When I first saw this film, with a good friend, I sat slack-jawed at the sheer visual spectacle. But what moved me to call this one of the best films ever, was the story and the atmosphere.Gilliam has predicted, in many ways, the world we now live in.Gilliam paints a picture of a country controlled by a secret police state, where information is exchanged and lives are changed. Terrorism and secret state torture are but a few of the themes he touches on in this dark Orwellian view of the future.Amid these darker themes is Jonathan Pryce as Lowry, an ""Every man"". Lowry trudges through his boring bureaucratic job. In his dreams he is heroic, saving the woman he loves from monstrous threats. When he meets a woman in real life that looks exactly like his dream woman, he suddenly breaks free from the yoke of oppression, and pursues her with all his suppressed passion. Unfortunately this action takes him down a one-way street, into the depths of the ""Homeland Security"", where he ultimately succumbs to torture. Dark? Yes, brilliant? Absolutely! When we finally came out of the theatre, we turned and looked at each other, my friend said ""That was a cerebral blow-out!"", I nodded in agreement.This film changed how I look at the world around me. There are many layers to this film, and it may take several viewings to really ""Get it"". Many people may never understand its genius. Those who make the effort will discover the underlying message about government bureaucracies, and the dangers of giving the government too much power, while surrendering many of our freedoms, for the illusion of ""Security"". Proof that this is a timeless classic is the fact that it has more relevance today, then when it was made.Beyond the fabulous cinematography, character development, acting, effects and action, is an atmosphere that is haunting.",Brazil

375,i_methos,1984 on crack meets A Clockwork Orange on acid - only funny,10,16 May 2002,"Brazil is truely one of the most ingenious films ever made.  Most of the film is spent trying to figure out what is going on.  Why is Sam falling into this fantasy world and what is he doing with his life?  Meanwhile, he drags himself deeper into a schizophrenic mess, trying to make his fantasies a reality.  Anyone who says that they completely understand Brazil is either lying or has the wrong idea.Many films these days leave audiences with feelings of ambiguity. Mulholland Drive, Memento and The Usual Suspects are prime examples of new movies that to this style justice.  Brazil took this idea a decade and a half earlier of loosing the audience and making them feel lost and laughed at them.  Not making fun of the audience and making them feel stupid like Vanilla Sky, Brazil makes the audience laugh at the satirical life corporate moguls are probably leading behind closed doors.  The higher up the ladder one goes, the more silliness transpires.One may say that it is like 1984, a perfect society for those who have the power, poverish for those who dont.  If you do not follow the rules to a tee, you WILL be punished.  It could also be like A Clockwork Orange.  A twisted tale of one man's struggle with society and how it affects him. Put them together and you have Brazil.What is Brazil?  Only Terry Gilliam knows for sure.  There are hundreds of interpretations with thousands of answers to his questions.  All we can be sure of is that Brazil is a masterpiece of film making.  A rare gem of extraordinary circumstances surrounding ordinary (or not-so ordinary) people.

But thats not really what got me. It was the dialogue: such great rhythm, so incredibly funny. It completely fitted (and fits) in my world-view: life and being alive is insane (thats what you get when you grow up with lots of Monty Python..)I don't agree with my predecessors on this section that the film's too long - its just right.

377,tony_bligh,Brazil Vs. 1984,7,21 April 2007,"Just after watching Brazil and struck by its obvious similarities to Nineteen-Eighty-Four, to give the film its proper title. While any budding critic can reel off the Orwellian influences in Brazil, I felt it may be more interesting to consider the divergences and attempts by director Terry Gilliam to distance himself from Orwell's masterpiece.Brazil is a much more visually arresting film then 1984. Gilliam was allowed free reign to express his unique visual style and found ample opportunity to impress and excite with trademark wit, surrealism and dramatics. 1984 is deliberately more low key, putting more emphasis on the dialog. A misplaced word or thought crime can be fatal in that environment.While both provide a dystopia, retro future (or present), the Kafkaeaque society of Brazil at least functions on some level. 1984 only exists in a hopeless, brutally efficient war zone of Orwells imagination. Resistance to the norm provided by De Niro's Tuttle, a comic vigilante plummer, is no comparison to Goldsteins studied logic but perhaps provides more hope. That Tuttle can exist due to an administrative error shows the system is flawed and will ultimately fail. 1984 would never admit such a mistake, Buttle would have been Tuttle and always was, as the corrected records would naturally show. Most surprising is the conclusion to the torture scene in both films. They diverge radically and you will have to see the films to know what I mean.Personally, I feel that 1984 is the more superior film of the two. The performances of Hurt and Burton are first rate, not taking anything away from Pryce, Holm and Hoskins. But the content, gravitas and impending (or current?) reality of 1984 stays with you. Brazil always had a hard act to follow coming a year after its namesake, being released in 1985. Though given the choice, I know which world I would prefer to live in, and it would be a lot more fun then BB.",Brazil
378,ironflag1,Dys(interesting)topia,2,10 January 2010,"Upon telling a few friends that I really enjoyed the book ""1984"", I was encouraged to watch the film ""Brazil"". 'A similar dystopian story with beautiful visuals' is what I was told. However, the plot for ""Brazil"" is mindless as can be, and as a film it requires strong motivation to watch the whole way through. That's not to say I was confused or befuddled about any part of the script, I understood everything that happened, but am astounded that this film could attain so many positive reviews. If nothing else, the storyline is utterly forgettable and the visuals have been outdated. There are a few redeeming moments in this film, particularly De Niro's character. However, it's simply not worth your time. Rent/buy/download at your own peril.",Brazil
379,ledzepforever-833-239611,A Masterpiece?,10,3 July 2011,"Of I was to pick one favorite movie, then that movie would be totally Brazil. For your information, I'm not a Terry Gilliam fan boy in any sense, but this movie, in my honest opinion, is a work of genius.Brazil is a movie released in 1985 and is widely known because of the battle Terry Gilliam fought against Universal, finally succeeding in convincing the studio to release his intended version. The film is based a lot in George Orwell's 1984, but in a more funny and retro-futuristic way.Brazil is one of those films hard to define, I could say it's a Sci-Fi Satire, but some people found it tragic at points, I personally cried at the end. I can say it's very nostalgic look at the 80′s and a very sad projection of the humanity's future. It can be said that Brazil is standing exactly in the middle between Comedy and Drama, being neither.The plot resolves around a person called Sam Lowry.Early on, however it appears that Sam Lowry is living in his dreams, where he has the chance to be brave and fight for the woman he loves.Sam is working in the Ministry of Information, when suddenly a mistake happens in the system. The police gets an innocent man, instead of the terrorist. So Sam Lowry is asked to go and fix it. However the harder he tries, the harder things become to explain, and Sam is caught inside the mess. To add to that, he sees the woman of his dreams in flesh and blood in front of him. Throughout the film, Gilliam is showing us the lunacy of the bureaucracy, and the complete misuse of technology which instead of making stuff more simple, makes them more complicated.What I absolutely love in the movie is that it takes a pretty normal sci-fi scenario, mixes a bit with noir and dreams and when you think you're seeing a typical sci-fi movie, the ending comes, and all becomes evident. It also features Sam Lowry, a character I could totally relate to. A complete pussy in real life and a hero in his dreams. Aren't we all a bit braver in our head after all? As for the music, it's in my honest opinion the most amazing soundtrack. I occasionally hum or whistle the theme song. Some of the same music was used in Wall-E.The movie is named after the theme song, which is a Frank Sinatra song. Some also claim that it's called because of Brazil not having extradition procedures, but it's really because of the song (""Aquarela do Brazil"").Terry Gilliam actually named the film after that song, only because he had this phrase ""It's only a state of mind"" indicating that the protagonist lives in his own version of the world, which he got when one day, at a beach in the UK, he saw a man humming that song, while the weather was rather nasty.Brazil is exactly like a sci-fi movie of the 80′s, except that it's not. At one point, I recall I was about to turn off the movie, and then on the next second, I was crying. Just watch till the end.After all it's only a state of mind.",Brazil
380,pepsicolasmileyface,Probably one of my favourite movies ever!,10,29 May 2013,"Brazil is that movie where you either love it or hate it, you either think its stupid or that its mind blowing. Well I loved it, This movie completely blew my mind away. This movie looks stunning, the city and the cinematography probably strike me the most. This movie is original and no one can say that it's not an original movie. All the performances were pretty good. In the end though it's the message in the end that matters is about modern life. It shows how people make things so complicated to make things easier and how bureaucracy is sort of destroying us. It shows us the story of a guy bored of his life and then this big change happens to him and his life suddenly becomes interesting after he sees this woman of his dreams at his job. It shows a world torn apart with ridiculous ways of life and then this spark of hope with this man drowning in all of his life. This movie probably has one of my favourite endings when in his mind he's escaped but in the end he's in a chair half dead. Another thing is that every time you watch this film there's always something new to see and these are the reasons why I love this movie.",Brazil
381,bcigor,The Sh*t - We're All in it Together,10,11 December 2005,"First of all, Brazil is the Best Movie i've ever seen. Nothing else could reach it and even come close. Before I saw it, i was always struggling about what movie i should ""give away"" the first place in my imagined movie-chart, but now i'm 100% certain.What is Brazil? It's hard to say. Everyone will find something different in it. As for me, Brazil is the movie i'll never forget, nor it will fade in my mind. Camera-work, sets, visual ""design"", attention to small details, love and passion of Terry Gilliam - all this advances demolished all my other ideals, other ""perfect movies"".It was a year ago. I went to a store, scouting for any DVD i could possibly buy. And there i saw Brazil. The same evening i watched it, and it left me speechless, bringing a new era in my life - Era of Terry Gilliam (and Monty Python).The more you know about Brazil - the more you're shocked. You think: ""it's Amazing. It's at least 50M$ spent on sets for sure."" And then you find out, that almost ALL the surreal locations were shot in the real world. Sets are amazing despite the fact they are not sets at all.Acting ... well it's even more amazing than the sets are. No one except Jonathan Pryce could ever play Sam Lowry the way he did. Robert De Niro, Bob Hoskins, Kim Greist, Ian Holm, Peter Vaughan, Katherine Helmond are great. And Michael Palin, my favorite Python (no offense to others, especially Gilliam, but Michael just acts too well), is playing the most dramatic and in the same way - comical role in his career. Fantastic Performance.What I love about Brazil: First of all - the ending. It's an absolute beauty. To lose your mind, to escape in such a horrible way, to humm ""Brazil"" sitting amidst torture chamber - it's something that can't be described until you see it.Second - is the ending as well. But from the moment Sam is being caught to the very end including credits. This 20 minutes i can re-watch every day. As well as other 120. But the last part is a masterpiece inside a masterpiece. The charges, that are simultaneously nonsense and so normal, so usual, so common. The GREAT scene with Mr Helpmann. And ... Torture Chamber. From the moment you'll see it - there is no way you could possibly imagine another one. Dreadful, full of darkness and fear, it's fantastic how Gilliam could get an idea of shooting Torture Chamber in such a place. Scene with Palin and his mask is an absolute best - one of the best scenes in the movie.Complete fascination brings to me the whole sequence between Harry Tuttle being consumed by the paperwork. The next scene - ""Mother! Mother!"" how i like to call it. IT IS the best scene in the movie. I just love every little second of it. There is nothing to say about it (at least nothing's coming to my mind), but THIS is the best scene in the movie. However, the whole movie is perfect... so don't judge me.The scene after the ""Mother! Mother!"" ... well i still can't name it. Possibly ""Running in Dream"", but it'll be too shallow. I couldn't invent something deep, so i call the movie part between ""Mother! Mother!"" and end credits pretty simple - ""The End"". And it shows every dream of Sam and a LOT more. It's fantastic. The final shot of Sam still leaves me breathless and speechless.Third part i like in Brazil is ... Dream Sequences. Absolutely surreal, they are describing all that you saw or will see in the movie in unusual, beautiful way, full of fantasy and imagination. And i praise a ""nightmare of reality"" moments, when Sam wakes up and all dreams are lost. The greatest part here - i begin to doubt whether the Reality is real. Dreams have way more sense, than moments after them. Especially the singing girl.The Last, Fourth Part i like in Brazil is Everything else. Every single bit of a movie. Every frame, every moment, each small detail, each dark joke and light thought. Incredibly, despite the bad ending, Brazil final seems very good. This was the movie that made me dream to go completely insane. It's a tragic ending. But i feel happy for Sam. Because HE could escape from the cruel world, full of blood, hate and neglect. The cruel world,based on violence, bureaucracy and technology, where freedom is being completely destroyed, where terror is being done not only by terrorists but by the government itself. Just like ours.For me Brazil is a prophecy. Prediction of a future, that was made 20 years ago and in the XXI century became a reality. ""Where do we live? In hell or something?"" I don't know if Terry Gilliam wanted to ask this question when he made this movie. But now it rises in the first minutes of the film, and keep growing till the end, bursting your soul to pieces.The more i watch Brazil, the harder it is to understand the world, that surrounds me. Nonsense happening all the time is not Brazil, it's Earth. Our mindless society, that deserves to be escaped from. Hate, Jealousy, Money, Ordinarity rule this world - not imagination, not originality, not love. That's not a good place to live for Sam Lowry. And for all of us. But, no matter what happens, we will still live in this society, accepting the rules that are set. Life is a piece of sh*t, when you look at it. BUT! Always look on the bright side of life.I still can't believe that there could be a Genius that made a PERFECT MOVIE that fits every single my desire. Thank you, Terry Gilliam for the Best Movie in my life.",Brazil
382,fraymurray,"Terry Gilliam's 1985 dystopian classic is beautifully realised, often hilarious and utterly horrifying, not least because it has turned out to be so prophetic.",10,13 August 2008,"It seems that there are people on Earth - even in Britain! - who still haven't seen Brazil. A while back I actually met some Britons in their early twenties who had never heard of it. This troubles me greatly.Terry Gilliam's 1985 dystopian classic is beautifully realised, often hilarious and utterly horrifying, not least because it has turned out to be so prophetic.Fundamentally - and very coherently - this is a film about systems breaking down: A dead fly drops into a printer, causing a misprint which leads to a man's mistaken death by torture; heating systems break down, and cannot be repaired because the Central Repairs support system is overstretched; the ubiquitous, massively complex systems of machines, presumably designed to make life easier, invariably go wrong when one or another link breaks down.It is also a film about systems breaking down humanity. With everyone having their own tightly defined role in the overarching bureaucratic systems that control everything, nobody has to take personal responsibility for anything else; mistakes are almost somebody else's problem, and nobody really feels they have the power to change anything. Throughout the film it's therefore difficult to pin much of the blame for any of the things that go wrong on any particular person. Even the head torturer (Michael Palin) gives the impression that he's only getting on with his job, the same as anyone.Almost all of the action of the film is driven by people struggling against these systems of control, whether by fighting back or (more usually) working around them. Our main protagonist, the affable dreamer Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), is bent on using his access to the Ministry of Information to find out more about the woman he thinks he loves, Jill Layton (Kim Greist), a quest which is complicated by the fact that she is considered an enemy of the state thanks to her efforts to find out what happened to her neighbour, the unfortunate victim of a clerical error. The closest thing we have to a hero in this story is Harry Tuttle, a renegade heating engineer played with much panache and very little restraint by Robert De Niro.This was Gilliam's third non-Python feature, after Jabberwocky and Time Bandits, and it maintains many of the comedy tropes of his earlier work. Although it is hugely over the top, with much of the melodrama played for laughs, the comedy aspects largely just add to the unease of it. This is a world gone utterly mad, but it nevertheless seems disquietingly plausible: The built-in unreality means it makes that much more sense when we find a cheerfully absorbed secretary typing up transcripts of hideous torture sounds, or we witness negotiations for a payment plan to cover the cost of someone's own 'interrogation'. How far are we from that sort of world right now? How much closer than we were when Brazil was made? For my money this is more disturbing than any film I've seen marketed as a horror.The story is interspersed with dream sequences, and next to the profound oddness of the reality they interrupt, it ends up increasingly unclear where one ends and the other begins. The dream sequences themselves are gorgeous and unsettling, even if their allegorical relation to the rest of the film veers between brutally unsubtle and rather obscure. Our protagonist flies on Icarus-like wings through fields of billowing clouds, over grim, haunted concrete landscapes, towards his dream woman. As the world throws maddening obstacles in his way, from eruptions of tower blocks to a huge robotic samurai, our dream-Sam valiantly fights his way through them, only to be thwarted again and again. It is in these dream sequences that it becomes most obvious this is a Gilliam film - everything about them could have come straight out of one of his animated Monty Python sequences, rendered with real actors, puppets and the best special effects that 1985 had to offer.The aesthetic of the real-world part of the film is equally striking. Costumes and sets place it some time around the 1930s, with technology perhaps extrapolated from that period in subtly different directions from the ones it actually took. Computer screens are tiny, unsheathed cathode ray tubes with great Fresnel lenses hung in front of them for magnification. Documents are shot from place to place using tubes. Indeed tubes of various sorts are a major motif of the film, prominent ducts snaking across the oppressive monolithic architecture in almost every shot, a visual metaphor for the tangled, high-pressure systems everyone is pushed through.Brazil is obviously a satire, but it also belongs to the tradition of visionary dystopian science fiction. Gilliam's targets are trends which he must have been dismayed to see not just continued but greatly strengthened in the decades since. His conception of humanity's descent into inhumanity has so far proved much closer to the bone than such obvious inspirations as George Orwell's 1984 and Fritz Lang's Metropolis, and right now there is little sign of us making any major collective effort to get off this course.",Brazil
383,toretorden,A look into a future where efficiency and technology leaves no room for humanity.,9,22 January 2007,"This movie is a pessimistic look into a future where technology, bureaucracy and efficiency has in many ways replaced humanity and people's freedom to do as they want.We meet Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce), a bureaucrat who dreams he could fly away from technology and bureaucracy and find the woman of his dreams. The reality of his life is something quite different. He's a slave of the modern, needlessly (in)efficient society where you can't do pretty much anything without the right form and a stamp. While trying to sort out the wrongful arrest of a Harry Buttle, Sam meets the woman he recognizes as the woman from his dreams (Katherine Helmond).Because of a mistake, it's believed that Sam is responsible for terrorist bombings and so he becomes hunted by the same people he used to work with and so the life of both him and the woman he meets are eventually in danger.In this movie, a cold society with it's needlessly advanced and (un)efficient bureaucracy turns innocent people into villains, gives no room for human emotions and turns friends against each other. The movie has a ""lovely"" feeling of desperation and helplessness as Sam is never on top of any situation but finds himself being pushed or pulled along by circumstances out of his reach.The ending, which I won't spoil, is deliciously daring and in retrospect - about as good as I think it could possibly be.Many (perhaps most) prefer this to the Fisher King, so depending on who you are and what you prefer, this may just be Terry Gilliam at his best.",Brazil

There are a few chuckles, but it's not worth slogging through the glacial pace. Many scenes are irrelevant and every scene goes on too long. Half-way through, I could not wait for the movie to end. I later found out my viewing companion felt the same way. There are short movies that are boring and long movies that are riveting. Brazil is the worst of both worlds: long and boring.

386,linkerro,"A heavenly dystopia, if ever their was one",10,22 August 2006,"I had heard that the movie is a good one, I just didn't know how good. As it happens I recently stumbled upon it and I said why not.This is a wonderful allegory that tells the story of a capitalist dystopia, run on the ""principiles"" of corruption, snobism, bureaucratical inertia, incompetence and lack of responsibility.As a person that has grown up in a former Communist country I have witnessed first hand the power of corruption and bureaucracy, and ever since reading ""Dune"" I was left with a strong resentment for both. As such, I always wanted to see something that might help the public awareness of this matter, since most people seem to be wallowing in both. This movie is just that, the story of people trapped in an unstoppable avalanche of events, triggered by something as small as a fly, and their inability to fight a system where no one takes responsibility, where everyone is a snob and thinking is not good for your career, let alone for your life. The story if a ""social services"" worker who dreams of being a knight in shining armor, in love with a trucker seeking justice for the wronged and a plumber turned Robin Hood. It's a perfect portrayal of today's society, all be it a bit stylized.The only thing that they got wrong in the movie is the time-frame. They missed it by about a decade :) All in all, it's a great movie, with great acting, great imagery, great concept for it's time and a somewhat surprising ending. I wanted to end this with ""If you liked that movie, you'll love this one"" but the truth of the matter is that the only one I could compare it to was Dogma, and I think I'm the only one who sees an analogy.

""Here it is, your very own door with your very own number."" All he is to the system is a number. What a classic moment in film.Despite this, it lacks one pivotal element of being po-mo in that it lacks entertainment.

At least one aspect of modern cinema is to be entertained, and I wasn't.If you like strange movies and the bizarre, I would guess that it would be a good film.

I remember enjoying the cinematics and some of the humor.  A few years later I saw it again and this time the disturbing nature of its storyline had a greater impact on me and I enjoyed it very much.  Some time later, when I was at University, the film came up in conversation and as it happened, it was shortly to be shown on TV again.  This time, I started following its sub-plots and various subtleties more closely and started uncovering the many layers that this film has.  From that point forward I was a devoted fan of this superb film.In 1993, after much searching, I eventually managed to obtain my own VHS copy of the film, which at the time was 'discontinued' by its distributors.Several viewings later this film still leaves me with that 'disturbed' feeling as the credits roll, I can't think of another film (fiction) that is as thought provoking as Brazil.I can understand why people can be fairly dismissive of this film at first viewing, it is incredibly black and can be confusing at times.

Terry Gilliam is a genius when it comes to making the best out of the money available. This film, whilst not made on a Hollywood budget, is simply superb in it direction and overall look.The story bears a strong resemblence to '1984' by George Orwell.

Also, there were so many concepts, quick cuts and shallowly fleshed out ideas, that none of it inspired much concern on my part and instead made me frustrated and bored. Some of the ideas had promise, but most were lamely executed on the part of the director, and most of the performances were too over the top to inspire much feeling, although the lead did a fair job. I loved The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, so if you want to see a Gilliam film, see that. It has heart, humor, much better cinematography, and corky ideas that have a flow and mesh together in a less mind numbing sort of way. If you want something Orwellian to watch, which has a brain, is complicated, intense, and beautiful, see 1984, 12 Monkeys, V for Vendetta, Children of Men, Blade Runner, A Scanner Darkly, A.I., or a Clockwork Orange... there are many others too, if only I could muster some memoryI really hope that people don't go into this movie with the high expectations I did.

396,SweetNightfall,Wow.,5,28 December 2020,"When you investigate the kinds of media and entertainment a person enjoys, you can learn more about them. I came to this movie, ""Brazil"", with this endeavor in mind to learn more about my favorite person, River Phoenix, as this was his favorite film. I do feel now after watching this, I've learned more about him as a person; like I've taken a peek at the complex desires inside him by closely studying this character in the film, ""Sam Lowry"".Sam is a dreamer. Sam wants to be all powerful. He wants to be handsome and clever. Sam works in a cubicle, but dreams constantly of a world where he's a hero and there is a beautiful woman longing for him to save her and protect her, and he can, because in this fantasy, he is her superman.His reality is much different; much lonelier and much more out of his control. His mother's too controlling; she thinks she knows what's best for him. The woman of his dreams is a seasoned criminal and doesn't need anyone, much less Lowry, to ""save"" her. He is not obscenely attractive, talented, or smart, and instead of doing the saving, he often needs to be saved himself due to lack of resources, connections, or abilities. He is not a ""superman"", but just a man.This contrast between the life of his dreams and his reality plays tug of war through out the film; one moment he's dreaming, the next he's not, and the back and forth happens so suddenly, it's often confusing. Sam himself isn't a very interesting or witty character, but it's watching him navigate the chaos of his life and see these visions of scenes from his dreams manifest in real life that are the most interesting moments of the movie. He has virtually no ambition, no goals, no drive in the film until Jill, the literal woman of his dreams, comes into play, and then we see Sam take a more ""active"" role.To tie this in to how it relates to River Phoenix, I did not understand very much why River liked this movie until I realized I had to imagine myself as the person who could see themself as the characters on the screen, and then I realized River is Lowry. Just as I live vicariously through the characters in my favorite movies and TV shows, River must have related to Sam Lowry so much, he felt himself experiencing the events in the film as if it were his own life. Then it made much more sense how an otherwise average film could mean so much to him.Maybe River's mother was a bit too controlling; maybe the type of person who thought she knew best for him when he wanted something totally different. Maybe River felt trapped in a job he didn't want but had to perform because of the opportunities it gave him. Maybe River dreamed of meeting a beautiful woman and sharing a life with her.The more I tried to see River in Lowry, the more I understood how he could love this film. Lowry is just a man; just a regular, soft and vulnerable man, as River was in his lifetime, but Lowry wished he could be that superman who could solve everything, and maybe River did too. Maybe there were a lot of things in River's life he wanted to change and tried to change, but couldn't; places where he wished he could save someone or someone could save him, but no one came through, just like Lowry in his eventual downfall at the end of the movie. Maybe River lived his life blurring the lines between dreams and reality and maybe all along he wanted to escape to that place in his dreams where he could be free and happy.Who could really know? But I feel by seeing this movie, I've discovered a deeper, personal side to him I'd have never known other wise because I wasn't blessed with the opportunity to meet him or spend time with him. Though I didn't find this movie, ""Brazil"", particularly fantastic or incredible and I wasn't personally moved by it, I do appreciate this feeling of closeness to River it's given me on my quest to learn more about him. And for that, I say, thank you :-)",Brazil
397,NumberSixForPres,"Wow, what a nightmarish movie.",9,7 July 2007,"I was interested in seeing this film, as I wanted to get into Terry Gilliam. The only film I had seen of his was The Brothers Grimm, which was a huge disappointment, but after seeing such a high score on IMDb, and after reading the plot line, I was interested, and rented it from Netflix. After just having finished watching it, all I can say is WOW! This movie has an amazing visual style, it captures the ethereal feel of dreams as well as seeming officious and bureaucratic. I felt like I was watching a twisted nightmare, with such strange imagery as concrete arms reaching out and grabbing Sam in his dream, and the giant samurai warrior. The visuals and special effects are fantastic, and they hold up surprisingly well today. Sam Lowry is a feeble man who works in the Ministry of Information. He tells everyone that he has no ambition, and doesn't wish for attention or promotions, but in his dreams, his true feelings are revealed. In his dreams he appears as a great warrior, with giant angel wings and strong armor. He constantly sees a beautiful woman, but is unable to get to her because of a giant samurai warrior keeping her in a cage. When he glimpses a woman resembling her, he pursues her relentlessly. Throughout the movie, I really began to care for Sam, I felt very sorry for him, I could tell that inside he really wanted to break free of his government and his job. He wanted something more, and haven't we all felt that at one time? Jonathan Pryce is wonderful as Sam Lowry, he's nervous, and he gets the unlikely hero down pat. This film was also chock full of other famous actors, such as Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Ian Holm, and Robert De Niro, who are a delight to see and try to spot. This movie was just a lot of fun. The black humor got many a laugh from me; it was great seeing such Pythonesque jokes in a movie like this. Yes, it is a bit like 1984, but it's much more lighthearted, but I wouldn't say it isn't as depressing. In the last 20 minutes, Sam tries to save his love, Jill, by pretending to kill her. Unfortunately, he is captured by police and sentenced to jail. What follows is an extremely confusing and nightmarish chase through the streets. You begin to wonder what is real and what isn't, and Sam's sanity is questioned. Could this all just be a dream? Then, just when you think everything is OK, you think they've gotten away, BAM! You're hit in the face with the jarring realization that Sam has snapped, and has been lost to his dream world forever. This sequence was amazing, I felt like I had walked right into the middle of a horrifying nightmare. Overall, this was an amazing film with good acting, an amazing visual style, and a nightmarish vision. Bravo, Terry Gilliam. You've made me a believer.",Brazil

Brazil is over two hours of brilliant eye candy.BUT...It was not very entertaining.  The almost non-existent plot was extremely hard to follow.

You may need to watch this several times just to grasp the storyline the whole way through, but it doesn't matter!  It's a film that expresses the very essence of modern society - and that includes the struggle to keep up with what's happening!There are elements of Brazil's world that we can immediately identify with - especially the continuous struggle of the main character - but Gilliam's stroke of genius was to meld those elements so thoroughly with a fantasy world that it's hard to discern where one ends and the other starts. There are so many unforgettable scenes that it's astounding that they are all in one film.  One of the strongest points is that, although the film employs special effects, it does not rely upon them.  It's the humanity of the characters that counts - for many of them, the nastier side of humanity.There's plenty here that could offend, and yet in some respects the ending redeems all the previous darker elements.

411,mstkls,Brazil as a social commentary,10,29 November 2011,"The diegesis director/writer Terry Gilliam creates in Brazil (1985) is a social commentary about future flaws in society, which Gilliam veils under his zany comedy. He humorously portrays a future dystopia similar to that in George Orwell's 1984 where civilians' lives are monitored and controlled by an omnipotent government. Gilliam satirizes so many aspects of modern and potential future society that a clear message is difficult to discern from his scattered work, but it is clear he recognizes flaws in religion and government and fears how they will manifest themselves in the future. His criticisms are deeply buried inside the film's comedic plot and characters, making it easier forThe film criticizes the commercialization of religion. In one scene it shows ""Consumers for Christ,"" a capitalist religious organization demonstrating at a store with a Christmas sale. A little girl at the store even goes up to Santa and asks him for a credit card. The film has a cynical view about religion, poking fun at how a spiritual institution has the same commercial goals as a business might, and is ultimately criticizing the institution of religion because they put capitalist agendas on their religious holidays.The portrayal of the government in Brazil bears semblance to the government in western countries in the post 9/11 era. The police randomly monitor people and tap phone lines without probable cause or any legal procedure, similar to what happened in the U.S. under the Patriot Act. The politicians inform the people they are ""defeating the terrorists,"" despite the fact no terrorists or tangible evidence of terrorism is shown in the film. This draws a parallel to the results given about the War on Terror; we are told we are winning it without any statistics or evidence that we actually are.Some of the films portrayals are more absurd in nature and also less clear in message. One scene depicts a man buying ""clean air"" from a vending machine off the street. This could statement about pollution and environmental degradation, a comment about the commodification of superficial products, or a just a silly gag thrown into the film for laughs. Brazil, though scattered in ideas, has a clear message of fear for the future of society portrayed by Gilliam's comedic homage to 1984. It's a legitimate fear, as the depictions of government and religion are look more and more like our government and religion every day.",Brazil

I think it is an important movie to see, not just for entertainment reasons, but because of the troubled political climate of today.I have noticed a striking and disturbing parallel between the government in the film and the Bush Administration.In the film, the government spreads propaganda and paranoia about ""terrorists"" in order to control people with fear, restrict their rights, and make them more accepting of intrusive search and seizure, arrest and detention. After all ""It's for their safety"".Hum.....

418,leopoldfilmmaker,A mind-bending masterpiece,8,19 November 2014,"""Brazil"" is a dystopian satire directed by the great terry Gilliam. It's a big, brawling, noisy, and mind-bending masterpiece. Gilliam blends some python-esque notes with many Orwellian themes, most specifically from the novel ""1984."" Taking place ""somewhere in the 20th century"", Brazil tells the story of a man who is caught in the chaos of suffocating bureaucracy, and dreams of literally flying away (a la a particular sequence from the Fellini film ""8 1/2"") The story begins with the main character involved in a messy situation involving terrorists and a woman whom he can't stop dreaming about. The film then quickly evolves into something much bigger- and stranger. I've read most of the popular dystopian novels, like said ""1984"", animal farm, brave new world, and slaughterhouse- five... But few works envision a more truly nightmarish and depressing perspective of the future than ""Brazil."" I find it amazing how people call this film a lighthearted comedy, it is FAR from it. It's actually one of the most emotionally oppressive and upsetting films I've ever seen. Gilliam captures all of the deep-rooted hysteria and maniacal angst of the genuinely terrifying future, that I found it almost impossible to enjoy. I'm not criticizing the film- I just see why it didn't do well at the box office. Laced with low-brow satire, mechanical pain and suffocation- Brazil is an extremely tortuous movie to sit through. It was such a grueling two hours and twelve minutes that I may never ever watch it again. That being said- I absolutely adored this film. Gilliam utilizes grand swooping camera maneuvers juxtaposed with a genuine sense of dread and fear, that there was a constant sense that ANYTHING could happen at any time. It was one heck of a ride, to say the least. This is one of the most unique and interesting cinema experiences I have ever had. Although, I obviously have some criticisms. The film definitely lacks in the final act, once actress Kim Greist is introduced, who turns in a less than impressive role. The chemistry between her and the main lead completely fell flat, and significantly weighed the movie down. Luckily, the film recovers in the final ten minutes (involving the infamous torture sequence.) the ending really made the film, and I can't imagine how horrible the studio ""love conquers all"" edit must have been. The film also is about twenty minutes too long, featuring some seemingly unnecessary sequences in which the main character battles an imagined 50 foot samurai robot, supposedly revealing Gilliam's love for Kurosawa films. I just didn't enjoy these sequences, and felt inclined to fast forward. Gilliam needed to be reigned in a bit, he was clearly very imaginative. Overall, however, I immensely enjoyed this original and creative film. With all of these minor complaints- there is one thing that is indisputable... Nothing is quite like ""Brazil"" 8/10",Brazil

He lives in an oppressive world of endless cubicles and bland, blocky apartments in bland, blocky buildings. In this world, there are many terrorists who plant bombs everywhere. People are so used to explosions in this world that in one scene, half a restaurant is blown apart, and the diners simply continue talking and eating their meals. Well, one day, a bug is squashed on the ceiling of an office and it's corpse falls into a machine that is printing orders for arrests for terrorist. The bug causes a single letter on a single name to be changed, resulting in an innocent man being arrested and tortured. Sam is the one that has to help sort this mistake out, but inadvertently gets mixed up in it himself.This movie is supposed to be a satire, but really all that is is just a couple of jokes sprinkled on the first quarter of screen time. The movie has dream sequences throughout, and those parts were the only pleasure I found in this film. Sam has dreams where he has wings and flies to a beautiful woman. Him flying through clouds and swooping down massive landscapes were nice to look at, and the movie has a nice visual look, I'll admit. But other than that, I found nothing of value in this movie. It felt just like a rehash of George Orwell's ""1984"". There are many scenes in this film that are hideously ugly and grotesquely disturbing, and they all add up to an ending that is so unsatisfying that you hate yourself for spending 131 minutes waiting for it.

But all that is involved in a lobotomy is the insertion of a sharp instrument ( such as the the Jack Lint character was wielding just before the Tuttle/Buttle character haves into view to ""save"" the situation )into the eye-socket, push it in as far as it will go, a sharp tap ( to break the bone ), push a little further, waggle it about a bit to break the connection between the two halves of the brain...withdraw the instrument and you are then left with a ""compliant person"" who was previously a "" dissenter "".

424,stathisart,Giliam's Manifesto,9,13 September 2005,"Gilliam's manifesto as a director. With this movie he gave us his aesthetic, he expressed through it a dark world of suggestion, fear and isolation. Bureocracy, rigid identity of people and services, adoration of the ego to the point of elevating oneself to divinity,where no mistakes are made, the world is perfectly perfected with each and every move one makes, that sinks him deeper into utter isolation and self-admiration. This is not about Orwell, about 1984; It is more about Kafka.It is about endlessly seeking the other person, about the need to participate, to communicate, the need to love, to know, to Be, and the Rejection of this need. The need is rejected both internally and externally, the worst pipes and proper channels are inside our heads, and threaten our very dreams. Structures that torture our subconscious minds are reproduced into our social life, they become the structure of society itself. The world of Brazil is an abstraction of these archetypal figures that reject our individuality, our needs as individuals. Societies are not made of governments or regimes or monarchs; they are made by people, and this movie is about the universe, the mythology, the symbols of an individual with chained wings.Revolution will come crashing the walls of reality, together with the shattered body that was tragically bound to them. What a great beauty this film possesses! How masterfully directed, the visual suggestion is crystal clear throughout the duration of the film, everything fits perfectly into an original,provocative and Sarcastic whole.

426,freelance-61062,Prescient brilliance!,10,9 February 2021,"If this is not the greatest movie ever made it is in the top 5. The relevance of this gem is greater and greater each year, especially to those who have suffered through the last 32+ years of American ""Government"" and its continuing Big Brother nightmare. There are those who simply don't get it due to the quirky nature, but I urge everyone to watch the Criterion Collections (the 3 disk 480p DVD has the most content but the print on the Blu-Ray is better) and view the different versions to understand all that Gilliam went through to realize this epic achievement. Even though it probably would have still been a flop at the box office I really wish he had managed to obtain the budget he originally wanted. It would have made an awesome film beyond spectacular. My only nit picky complaints don't detract from the genius or lower the rating from a solid 10/10. As always there are a few continuity errors, but nothing major. While most of the modeling was incredible I wish the chase scene had a more realistic aspect to it. I think the only weak casting link in the film was the choice of Kim Greist as Jill though her acting performance was admirable. She just didn't quite fit perfectly with the magical meshing of the rest of the cast, and their flawless off the wall and very memorable characterizations throughout. I have seen this film more times than I can even remember. I watch it at least every couple of years just to pick up on Gilliam's prescience foretelling even more events from real life. While Gilliam has some other significant films to his credit every film maker has one that stands out and this is not only his greatest achievement but an example of how important and influential a truly monumental film can be. I pity those who write this off as just a ""weird"" or ""all too British"" style romp. Also the descriptions (even from the studio) that this is some Sci-Fi tale of a dystopian future must have missed the opening which clearly states ""Somewhere in the 20th Century"" as it is a brilliant parody of our lives today. I wish there was a version of 1984 which even came close to the brilliance of this masterpiece and hope that some day soon before it is illegal and all copies of Orwell have been burned that someone could do that book justice with a comparable cinematic achievement. For all who did not understand this movie I urge you to watch the director's cut without interruption. Never view any version of this on TV as it has most likely been butchered and commercials are forbidden. Worship Gilliam, the crew, and cast of this forever relevant film.",Brazil

428,Chimal,There are really few films as near to Kafka as this one,10,7 August 1998,"One of the great accomplishments of Gilliam's ""Brazil"" is that it suggests a ""horrible future"" without truly making it a future. There is no speculation , no guessing, no ""future"" clothing or architecture, and so it can't be any real country or culture --and it could be any. What matters here is not historical accuracy, but symbolism. And thus ""Brazil"" is one of the most truly Kafka-esque films ever made.",Brazil

I really want to stated that THIS FILM brought me to a complete understanding of ""Who am I and what I'm looking for in my life?""I was a science student in high school and studied Business Management in University.  I read very few novels and paid little attention to any kinds of fine arts before I approached to ""Brazil"".  From that time onwards, I became crazily in love with painters like Klimt, Mucha, Magritte and writers like Kafka and DosToyevosky.  An exploration to a brand-new horizon of my mental-vision.Just like SAM in ""Brazil"", he is desperately seeking and knowing JILL as if it was his only lifetime mission/destiny.  He sacrifices his training, promotion, career, family, future and even his life in achieving Jill's trust for his amourous heart.  I think everyone should have some in-born dreams/insight for life.

Definitely not geared toward those who want to sit back and be mindlessly entertained, nor for those looking for some kind of feel-good cathartic experience, this film is a scathing attack on the status quo, and a slap in the face to the typical Hollywood narrative.

They didn't.I found myself thinking about an hour into the film ""How did they decide to spend the money to make this trash?""  I should have gone with my instincts and turned it off after the first hour, but I was hoping that it would all come together; that the story line would all of a sudden make sense.

What I was treated to has to be the most wonderfully imaginative movie ever made.  Brazil tells the story of Sam Lowery, a very strange person in an even stranger world where swatting a fly can have disastrous implications.  The movie is visually stunning, the story is intriguing, and Brazil has the all time greatest end to a movie.

The score is well-suited and just plain cool. Jonathan Pryce is perfectly convincing as a man who has just awakened to how very silly and wrong the world is. Needless to say, Robert De Niro is as brilliant as always. The movie is visually stunning.The main reason I like this movie is that I identify with Pryce's character, Sam Lowry. He day dreams.

I came across this film accidently and fell in love with it, it said many things about the world we live in that I completely agree with.  Perfectly acted and masterfully directed, this is an excellent film that you will fall in love with if you can get to grips with the directors visual style. PS.

You too may have gone at some point to rent this masterpiece from the cult classics section of your local video store, taken it home, and felt confused or just unimpressed. That was my first impression and I had a very hard time juxtaposing my feelings with the rave reviews I kept hearing. I tried again some time later with the same results, which left me feeling that this was one of the worst films I had ever seen. Then a friend suggested that perhaps I had seen the edited cut and that if so then I might have missed everything cohesive about the story. If you look at the stats, you'll notice that the USA edited release is 40 to 50 minutes shorter than the other versions. On his advice, I got a longer edition and watched it with the clear intent to quit early. I found myself more and more interested as I watched, and soon I was sold. I cannot describe the simple joy of finally being able to clearly interpret the director's intent without juggling in my head all the possible meanings of artistic expression, character fantasy, and plot implied by the disjoint transitions of the shorter version.Although watching the director's cut is a bigger investment of time, those minutes are vital to the story. I am so glad that I got a second chance, and you might be too. Do not waste your time on the edited cut of this film. The proper cuts of the film have all the missing story elements! Check the play time and if it is less than two hours, put the box down and back away quickly.",Brazil

The visuals are spectacular, the design magnificent, and the lighting and camera angles often call upon the expressionist films of yore. The story is strong and the context is completely envisioned. But despite a strong start the movie slowly becomes horribly bloated and unfocused, loses its sense of pacing and borders on the unwatchable. I feel that the final result is something akin to the notorious film 'Dune' directed by David Lynch, having elements that are truly visionary but somehow winding up in mediocrity in the end. Still, if you're looking for something you probably haven't seen before, I would recommend at least one viewing to anyone.

Then comes the overdone images and satirical leads to things like the political system.  Most of those who have enjoyed it probably feel proud to see the analogies, but as a film all of it is overplayed and honestly boring.  I have seen this both during the original theatrical release back in 1985 (and I note it was the only time to this day I ever felt like leaving in the middle of the movie) and just recently on DVD, and it was even worse this second time around. A small saving grace - Robert DeNiro, a tad few years younger, is still fun to watch, but not worth the money to buy the movie for your home collection.

The superlative performance of Pryce and all the supporting actors, not to mention Richardson (who sadly passed away just a week ago), made this a into an experience that has to be savoured often in order to maintain a proper perspective of the current world.

In these days when ""Information Technology"" seems to rule the world economy, the themes are even more topical than they were in 1985. In addition it's a satire on the fate of revolutions and the nature of freedom, a quirky love story with endless confusing and delightful turns, and a series of deathless images -- the soaring metal samurai, the serpentine white vacuum cleaners that inhabit the ministry at night, the computer terminals made out of wide-bodied noodles. Gilliam's humor is morbid and eternal: Bob Hoskins wielding a document authorizing a home invasion for ""unnecessary repairs"" as though it were a light saber; Jonathan Pryce's boss terrified by a refund check; Pryce's office walls literally closing in. Robert De Niro is the hero we always want more of, the one man capable of dealing with the physical world of steel and glass without the intercession of paper. Unlike many who have come to love ""Brazil"" more gradually, I was wild about the film on first viewing it, and I keep going back. This is the anti-Casablanca, a world where the sacrifices are cryptic and romance is frequently throttled by the sacred Document.

How prescient Terry Gilliam was of the neo-Fascism/Bureaucracy that afflicted UK/British/Australian/Canadian society for the next 25 years. Here were the sets which could have been designed by Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, in a movie being released when Thatcher and Reagan were beginning their reign, with the UK's top actors and Robert de Niro and a lovely blonde with angled facial features who anticipated the new feminine women's movement. The quirky bits of the movie, driving on the right side of the road while calling trucks lorries, were very endearing. The love story was wonderful. I strongly recommend Brazil but not for kids younger than 13, and not for adults without an educated sense of humour. But I don't think Heaven was Brazil. I haven't been in Argentina, and didn't swarm in on the final credits, but I think Heaven is where the Sundance Kids held out until they were finally sent to their deaths. Belated thank you, Terry Gilliam, on Mother's Day eve.

463,The_Nameless_2007,Brazil is Amazing,10,5 May 2007,"Brazil is a sci-fi\drama\black comedy directed by Monty Python member Terry Gilliam. Written by Charles McKeown, Tom Stoppard, and Terry Gilliam himself. Starring Jonathan Pryce, and features Robert De Niro, Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins, and Ian Holm. Co-writer McKeown also has a small role.Taking place in a dystopian future ran by bureaucrats. Brazil is about a man named Sam Lowry, a low level bureaucrat who, despite being conflicted about his role in an apparently overpowered bureaucracy, is actually happy with his job, but still complacent with everyday life. Sam escapes to a fantasy dreamland whenever he sleeps. In his dreams he is some sort of angelic warrior trying to save a woman trapped inside a floating cage. Its not long until his life goes crazy when his mother trys to get him a promotion, he meets a renegade heating engineer, and sees the woman he has literally been dreaming about.The dream sequences are really something to behold, with effects that were amazing for their time and are still amazing even today. The first dream is neat, Sam has some cool metal wings, a shiny breastplate, a sword, and he's flying through the clouds and Sam sees the woman in the cage before he is awaken by the phone. Brazil has some amazing visuals and an equally as amazing story. The story is an incredibly deep one, there are many subplots(which confuses a lot people, but didn't pose a problem for me) and an abrupt, but powerful plot twist at the end, and you really sympathize with the main character through his development throughout the movie. Brazil, like so many other great movies, is full of contradictions, its pessimistic yet whimsical, its serious yet funny, its dark yet romantic. It might be subjective, but I think Brazil is one of the greatest films of all time and I think it deserves to be praised as such.

It took every ounce of personal strength to stay through it.The themes and characters were woefully underdeveloped, the effects were childish at best (and this movie was made 8 years AFTER Star Wars) and the only acting worth mentioning was Razzie material to say the most.All in all this was horrible and I will never again listen to any supposed ""movie person"" who says that Brazil was a great movie.

It's an entertaining thinkers movie that uses irony, visual hyperbole and strange scenes - sometimes violent - to make the point that power in the hands of government can be a dreadfully bad thing for the citizens it purports to serve. The strangeness of many of the films images cause them to linger in the mind for quite a long time and they keep reminding one of the value and fragility of liberty as current events eerily ofttimes recall a scene or theme in the film.

470,rodrigo_braz-1,Puzzlingly boring,6,1 September 2007,"The fact that this movie is so well regarded really puzzles me. I have found it incredibly boring due to the uninterrupted stream of clichés and obvious images: a massive bureaucracy represented by mindless drones dressed in the same impersonal way; the dehumanization represented by people oblivious to bombs going off next to them; the hero who doesn't fit and dreams, of course, of flying and finding a beautiful woman (I admit the wings are well done and provide a beautiful image).A movie can be excused, and indeed lauded, for being full of clichés when it was the one actually introducing them. But these images are very old. Orson Welles's ""The Trial"" and ""Blade Runner"" (released merely three years before) come to mind. One can make the point that the clichés are somehow a reference to those movies, as well as to a noir atmosphere, but it is just pointless and not interesting.Terry Gilliam seems to have learned a lot since them; ""The Twelve Monkeys"" is one of my favorite movies.",Brazil

472,petahhhhhh,This Movie Was Too Much,9,29 April 2009,"As I started up this movie, I went in only knowing it was a sci-fi flick from the 80's. almost instantly I found my self being hung up on the story almost every scene. This movie is full of heart clenching moments.It was like a gunshot to the face of heavy insanity. I found myself almost disgusted with this creative style of cinema. (just wasn't suspecting it to be what it is.) Brazil was becoming unbearable to watch. I shut this wonderful blend of dark drama and bleek look at the future off after I witnessed the main character in a tiny vehicle very much resembling the SMARTCAR, which is the 2-person little vehicle, DRIVING UP ON SCREEN. It was too creepy. I am going to watch the rest tomorrow. -for anyone who likes retro brutality! also check out Videodrome!",Brazil
473,CanadianJoe,A must see,9,4 July 2009,"Gilliam is able to predict many events that are occurring in the world right now, from terrorism to consumerism to plastic surgery, everything in Brazil remains fresh and relevant. This is a a great example of satire, along the lines of Dr. Strangelove, and a technically stunning film from Gilliam. The dry, British humor is very dark (""and here's my receipt for your receipt"") and will make you laugh, despite the horrible things happening in the Orwellian society. Jonathan Pryce is very likable as Sam, and De Niro plays a role that he has never played before or since. A must see for any Python fan, (how I was attracted to see it) or any fan of Stanley Kubrick (the cinematography is reminiscent of a Clockwork Orange).",Brazil

Jonathan Price is perfectly cast as a lacky to the system whose dreams take him beyond what he was meant to be. The supporting cast is as amazing and hiliarious as Price. DeNiro gives a memorable role as Tuttle, a renegade repair man who fights the system in the only way he sees fit. If you haven't seen ""Brazil,"" SEE IT!!",Brazil
476,SpencerBerry,Inconsistently excellent...,8,26 February 2003,"This film gives me mixed feelings. As it began, I was a bit confused, disoriented, but I got the impression that was the point.  And the anti-societal message began to shine through, pointing out the many flaws in the system via exaggeration... And the film continued, transfering obviously between Sam's dreams and reality, always keeping his dreams from becoming true... It was beautifully executed, putting you in a world that is quite unlike reality, yet you can see how it is based upon reality, and exaggerated to make ""the system"" seem absurd... Once this point was made, it was repeated, over and over, which is why this film falls short of my full praise... I found myself toward the close of the film teetering between loving it and hating it, for they kept reaching possible endings, alternating between happy/unlikely endings and ""sad""/realistic endings... But in the end it closed well, displaying how if the government was allowed to go this far, the only escape would be a dream...which to me is a great point to be made, especially with our current situation in this country... Overall, well worth my watch, but I doubt I'd sit through it all again...but I won't stop myself from recommending it to people where I see fit...",Brazil

Not to mention Terry Gilliam's greatest achievement, and that's saying a lot, seeing how great his body of work is. It's a bleak, dystopian love story partly about the dangers of Totalitarianism, much in the style of Orwell's classic 1984 novel, so if you're not a fan of that sort of thing, you may not like it.The film is co written, and incredibly well directed by my favorite director, the aforementioned Terry Gilliam, and despite his other fantastic films(Twelve Monkeys, Fisher King, ETC.)

This has no story and no appeal. The only challenge was whether I could watch it right through to the grand finale; I kept trying to resist turning it off, convinced that nothing so pointless could have been awarded such praise and that surely a moment would come when it finally revealed its true wisdom... but nothing of the sort happened. It just continued to systematically get worse & worse until I could bear no more and switched it off, no wiser as to the outcome and in a way relieved that I never found out, only regretting wasting 2 precious hours of my life on this nonsense.

480,r-behringer,This is about our own current society,10,27 March 2011,"This film is absolutely hilarious, pointing out with means of irony, satire, and parody the flaws of totalitarianism. Besides the overall theme of a fictional retro-future dictatorship, the movie has several layers relevant to our own society.WORK ENVIRONMENTWe all have encountered such pathetic specimens: The incompetent cowardly boss Mr Kurtzman, unable to take responsibility and delegating everything to his subordinate Sam.The false sense of action and energy, when the supervisor runs through the halls, followed by a crowd of subservient subordinates requesting decisions swiftly given by the superior.The dire working conditions (dark narrow office) much in contrast to this energetic positive work attitude.The petty competition of fellow coworkers, exemplified in the neighbor of Sam pulling the shared desk towards his own side or trying to show off his (non-existent) computer skills.The way how office workers break rules/regulations to make work life more bearable, by watching a classic movie channel.TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENT""We in the West"" live in democracies, but much of the double speak shown in the film has slowly penetrated our own political life.The cruel and impartial attitude of security forces making prisoners and putting them into these sacks reminiscent of hooded photos from Abu Ghraib. These forces are ""normal"" people, chat about work misery (headache from helmets), but treat their subjects with non-compassionate harshness, strictly according to procedures and regulations.The government's paranoid pursuit of suspected terrorists and efforts in uncovering hidden (non-existent) connections. See the pursuit of Tuttle, who just wants to work as a heating engineer, because he enjoys it, but hates to comply with tight rules and regulations. We see currently the same by linking every terrorist act to ""Al Quaida"", even if the links are unproven (war in Iraq comes to mind, also ""9/11 changed everything"") Emptiness of slogans, public announcements, posters, showing the paranoia, feeding the public fear of terrorists and justifying government actions.Refusal of government authority to admit an error. The heartlessness and lack of compassion when they realize the error. The overall long-winded process of appeal when citizens tries to correct it. And the labeling of such citizens as a terrorists.GENERAL SOCIETYTwo attitude types enable totalitarian systems: one is represented by the under-the-radar-screen-operating main character, Sam. The other attitude is represented by the ambition, opportunism and suppression of conscience by Jack Lint, actively supporting the system and one of its representatives.The obsession with youth and cosmetic surgery, represented by Sam's mother's plastic surgery and her desire to look young. The parody of cosmetic surgery peaks twice: in once instance the person whose surgery went terribly wrong, dies. In the other instance, Sam's mother looks like his love interest in an Oedipean twist, although only in his mind during the torture.The emphasis on cleanliness in the streets, where passers-by are upset when a few papers are dropped on the streets, but where nobody appears to protest against the dirty oppression.The celebration of Christmas which has lost all spiritual meaning and is hollowed into formality of giving thoughtless interchangeable arbitrary presents. The consumer society (""Consumers for Christ"") encompasses shopping, expensive goods, and even when a bombing occurs, the show must go on. But actual substance is lost: meals are only piles of colored mash.Blind faith in technology - but a simple bug can have deadly consequences, and technological gadgets appear to malfunction at any opportunity. Especially the climate control. Everywhere are many hoses and wires, at home, in the restaurant, during public cleaning.The annoying dealings with the monopolized services of Central Services. Everybody in our own world and time has had to deal with such non-responsive entities (BT comes to my mind). Free enterprise (Tuttle) is illegal.The overabundance of bureaucracy as it stifles all functioning of a society. The formalization of all transactions with receipts and receipts for receipts, the rules and regulations that govern everything. The strict adherence to these rules appears to give every government action a coat of legitimacy.The loss of natural environment, as a consequence of providing energy/power and of overpopulation in densely urban cities. There appears to be no park, no trees. People live in dense blocks without any daylight. Roads outside the city lead to power plants, through deserted polluted landscapes, big billboards blocking the view and showing advertisement and government slogans, depicting among other things landscape and blue sky, which is no longer in existence in the real world.Desensitation of children: growing up in dire housing complexes, playing war games with weapons. For Christmas they get guns as presents, and they play out security force and prisoners, with realistically hooding their prisoners as the adult world is doing it. This desensitization is also a reality in our real world, by the proliferation of ego-shooter computer games.FILMOGRAPHICThis movie pays homage to classic movies, as the only thing bringing real joy, but also acting as an escapism for the unbearable reality of the present life. Very funny the reference to Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"" where security forces walk down the stairs, and a lonely cleaning equipment cart rolls down these stairs (instead of a stroller like in the original). Also there is a parallel to the film that the office workers are watching (""Casablanca""), when Jonathan Price says to his boss ""here is looking at you"".Overall this movie is addressing all the above topics not on a rational level, but on a deeply emotional one. The main protagonist has his dreams, and in a very illogical way these dreams meddle with the reality, as he suddenly sees and meets the woman of his dreams. This film is an emotional appeal for humanity, to do everything to prevent such a society becoming reality. Because once it is established, there is nothing that can bring it down – as the very pessimistic ending of the film implies.",Brazil
481,pknapp63,Eye candy and poignant metaphors,10,13 August 2003,"My favorite movie and the first DVD I ever bought ($50 for the 3 disc collector's edition), I have seen ""Brazil"" more times than any other movie (including Wizard of Oz as a kid). Although made in 1985 (before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union), it is nonetheless poignant in today's post-9/11 world. Terry Gilliam may be too wacky for most, but there are lots of metaphors and eye candy to keep even the most high-minded viewer entertained. Everything means something, so every time I see it I make more connections. The first time I saw this movie (in a theater, when first released) I thought understood it; but I was so intrigued that I went back a couple days later and saw it again -- and ended up more confused than ever! After numerous viewings, I think I was pretty much on with my first impression. Fantastic production, some classic scenes, plus deus ex machina by Robert DeNiro makes this a thrilling ride every time. Beware of the ""edited for TV"" version (""Love Conquers All"") -- the ending is completely different and all the bite has been taken away! Don't waste your time with anything but the full-length theatrical release.",Brazil
482,rhampur,The dream of a modern Quixote,10,21 August 2003,"First Time I saw Brazil I felt shocked by a strange self-identification with the main role (Sam Lowry). Not in terms of what he actually experienced on the movie, but I felt identified with his freedom and love hopes within his oppressive world. The film atmosphere reminded me the world represented in Orwell's 1984 or in Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. An individual tries to find a place for happiness in a grey society that controlled all the people through the Information Department (this is a clear reference to 1984's Big Brother). The profession of Sam is also a good point: he's just a sad bureaucrat in a Government institution. He knows that this is not his world and desperately needs a change to cope his expectations of a better world. Accidentally he knows his `Dulcinea' and he immediately identifies her as the reference of all what he deep desired: freedom, love and happiness. His dreams are a metaphor of his feelings. The idea of this modern Icarus (flying with bird wings) and the central theme of the film (Brazil) increase the contradictory feelings of sadness and hope. I also liked the existential idea of unconditional surrender that is behind all the human beings (as mortal beings). I've got no doubt if somebody asks me about my favourite movie (and I've seen a lot). It has always been (and probably will be) Brazil.",Brazil

Throughout the film many lives are drastically changed for the worst because of some government mishap. Sam Lowry dreams about freedom and love but the government causes many obstacles. Terry Gilliam's Brazil shows how an oppressive government full of flaws can shatter someone's dreams.Sam Lowry is presented as a lonely man who must succumb to dreams in order to fulfill his loneliness and need for recognition. The first time we are introduced to Sam he is seen dreaming about flying over the clouds in an angelic suit heading over to kiss a woman. However, when he wakes up we can see that Sam lives alone and works for the government. Sam tries to find out more about the woman of his dreams, even if it requires going behind his boss' back. Unfortunately, Gill; the woman of his dreams tries to avoid him because of her criminal record. Sam's purpose throughout the whole film is to get in touch with Gill and escape with her after he sees all the government flaws. As Sam and Gill are ready to escape and finally make Sam's dream a reality, the government breaks in, kills Gill and takes Sam prisoner.Throughout the film, the Government is shown as Sam's opposing force.. The government constantly tells Sam he must follow regulation and keep up with all the paperwork. As Sam ascends his position as a government employee, he starts to notice how the other government employees are twisted and how they are not what he expected. Once Sam tries to escape with the woman of his dreams the government breaks in and shatters all of Sam's hopes and dreams.",Brazil

Why? because this film has a very simple message wrapped up in a tightly knitted rouge of subtexts. the small minded viewer will simply occupy his mind with futile reasonings on these subtexts, however in order to fully comprehend this films magnitude one must spend less time on the subtexts individual meanings and more on what the subtexts mean to the bigger picture. this bigger picture is futile society.

The whole movie is riddled with black humor that pokes fun at the absurdity of modern items such as paperwork, technology and plastic surgery. Gilliam's surrealist style definitely stems from his early work with Monty Python. A lot of the social commentary has clearly influenced by those days of British sketch comedy as well. However, Brazil has a much more sinister message and plot.Keep an eye out for the 1984-esque posters in the movie.

492,ivamestrovic,This review analyzes Brazil in several paragraphs in which I write on some topics covered in the movie.,9,29 March 2013,"FIGHTING ABSURDITYTo criticize the society of today, or the one of 1985, is not easy. It has always been difficult to accentuate flaws of the society. Authors of written observations about the world and its defects, usually use the same trick to avoid assaults. They travel in time. They either place events in the past, or in the future. Terry Gilliam chose the latter one. Gilliam's Brazil exquisitely distinguishes terrible shortcomings of the society giving emphasis on timeless stupidity and extremely ineffective bureaucracy.BUREAUCRACY""This is your receipt for your husband... and this is my receipt for your receipt.""The plot of the movie is focused on a highly inefficient and ultimately dangerous bureaucratic system and it effects on people. The plot is concentrated around the event where a simple and rather stupid mistake ruins several and fundamentally changes some lives. The world of Brazil is the one where money is spent on ministries which are end in itself, where every home device is automatic but nothing really works, where guards are dressed like SS troops and people are just numbers. THE IDIOCY OF SNOBBERY ""There's been a little complication with my complication.""The stupidity and falsity of high society is perfectly depicted through protagonist's (Sam Lowry) mother and her cosmetic surgeries. The peak of stupidity is the celebration of her latest operation. The same is skilfully represented in the dinner scene. The dinner is held in a supposedly luxurious restaurant where all allegedly fine meals are just swills. Just like the people who go there. FANTASIESThe movie is intertwined with protagonist's fantasies about a lady of his dreams. He tries to rescue her, his captive princess. On the way he fights giant samurai, 'zombie-hunchback-children', freaks. All of these represent different officials, SWAT team, and other problems which he encounters. TUTTLE THE RENEGADEArchibald Harry Tuttle, apostatized heating engineer, helps the protagonist and impersonates the other side of the society. The ones which fight against the stupidity of bureaucracy. Tuttle is represented as an 'Air Condition Batman', an outcast, fighting for the right cause and always leaving theatrically. The world of Brazil is a combination of Kafka's Trial, Orwell's 1984, and, sadly, our reality.(more reviews on: http://filmolit.blogspot.com/ )",Brazil

The writing for this film could have been done by a dolphin with some waterproof paper and pens.

497,brendonconnelly,Quite Certainly the Greatest of All Films,10,3 January 2005,"Brazil is not only Terry Gilliam's masterpiece, it is the greatest piece of film making ever executed. I have never heard a criticism levelled against it that could not be unravelled, or seen a serious case made by anybody not brazenly carrying their own agenda.Gilliam is a master of technique. He is also a master of story. What elevates his mastery on both of these counts, is that he understands technique IS story. The production design, the camera movement, the lighting, the cutting, the music, the composititons, the performances - each are interlaced with a frighteningly tight integrity.Biases aside, this film has been gaining acceptance with general viewers, critics, buffs and other film makers across the world. I believe it will come to be seen as the great milestone in cinema that it is - the moment when every decision the director made was made with the same fire, same sharp wit, same clear intention and same allowance for intelligence, imagination and implication on the part of the audience as every other.I write at the beginning of 2005, and I know that Gilliam has two films due for release later this year.

The film is a slightly distorted reflection of our days.Camera-work is great; performance of the actors is superb; music, props and costumes create just the right atmosphere.

It's a cross between 1984 and Monty Python, but full of corny, dated (unfunny) humour and slapstick antics. The story is trite - I mean, many of us hate bureaucracy and think it overshadows too much of our lives (I do) but that's not a big enough point to keep anyone's interest for 148 minutes. I liked the music, I got the allusions to other films, but despite the acclaimed surrealism here, I wasn't engaged.

501,aghorrorag,See this film for what it is,1,29 July 2005,"The minute someone reads this review who likes this film will automatically believe that I have no appreciation for films with a hidden deeper meaning and that try to give social commentary. This is not the case, my favorite films are the ones that try to deliver a message about our society. However, the movie itself is more important than the message. Simply, people watch film for entertainment, if they wan't philosophy, they'll search themselves and find it. Our protagonist, Sam Lowry is propelled by reoccurring dreams to fight the ""the beast"" (the government), in order to save love. My first problem is with the beast. Gillam does not show us how the people of this society are suppressed. The audience knows that the government made a mistake by killing an innocent man named buttle instead of tuttle. This is the reason the government should be brought down? I bet every country in the world has killed at least one innocent man. I sympathize with the government, rather than our protagonist because Gillam doesn't show on film that this government is oppressive. The second problem is with why Sam has decided to not live his life by society's rules. He goes against society to find a girl whom he loves in his dreams. This is the plot of the movie (talk about a weak plot). Despite the fact shes a suspected terrorist and he doesn't know her at all, Sam still goes madly after her. The film does not have a political message as many may think; it is a story about a frustrated man who chases for love. This is a very weak plot as previously stated. In addition, the movie is filled with dream sequences which are confusing to follow and hard to tell when hes awake or when hes asleep. This movie requires many viewings to figure out all these dream sequences. I personally expect a movie to deliver on first viewing. In addition, the audience has one developed character, Sam. What Tuttle exactly does is fairly confusing. What Sam's love interest does is very confusing. Also, the audience doesn't get to see the structure of this society, it is never explained. Then the ending, one of the worst endings ever recorded on film. We are taken on a great climatic ride, only to find out it didn't happen. So, what happened during that giant dream sequence? I would have loved to see Sam breakdown while being tortured so the audience could see his motives and see him develop, but the audience is robbed of this.In summation, a very hard movie to follow with weak social commentary and weak character development Warning: this movie may give you a headache.--adam--",Brazil
502,jjccxx220,A very accurate vision of the modern USA,7,7 September 2013,"Being an old man, I surprised myself at not having seen this when it came out. Terry Gilliam was a brilliant member of Monte Python's Flying Circus and I would have been interested in anything he did.Now, viewing it nearly thirty years after it came out, his prescience is amazing. For younger members, the Internet didn't exist for most people until the mid 1990's and personal computers wired together were not common at the time this was made.Except for the appearance of the modern world, he got it right. Today, we live in a surveillance society where we are tracked electronically wherever we are and whatever we do. American police practice the kind of assault and then ask questions more and more, as news reports will show. People are divided into the slaves and the government powers.How does a man survive in such a world? He does what our hero does - works his job, keeps his mouth shut and keeps his head down. Until he sees a vision of the woman in his fantasies in real life, and risks all to find her.Again for younger members, who never heard of the Soviet Union unless they had a rare history teacher, Gilliam's society is like what prevailed in that dictatorship. Never tell the truth except to the police, never share an opinion, never trust anyone. In modern America, we find the Soviet Union gone but its principles have traveled here, courtesy of political correctness. Tell the truth or share your opinion, and there is someone who wants to sue you. Trust the wrong person, of whom there are lots, and live to regret it.Finally, the society depicted in ""Brazil"" is Obama's idea of utopia. He and his crew are working hard to make it happen, and most Americans are too busy with ""Survivor"" and ""American Idol"" to know or care.This movie will be a wake-up call, if nothing else.",Brazil
503,berynn-796-758229,"A rare surrealist film, the best of the Monty Python canon and off-shoots, one of the best movies I've seen",10,20 September 2013,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is set in a deco-style fantasy-noir world blending kitsch fashion and bleak utilitarianism, grey ducting being the most prominent design motif.Sam Lowry (Jonathon Pryce) is a highly competent, guileless functionary in a government ministry, with a dash of charm that hints at the romanticism in his heart. As his dreams propel him away from the comfortable routine, he comes up against the bureaucracy that has hitherto sustained him.Pryce gives perhaps the best performance of his career, comic, fevered, innocent and vulnerable, occasionally suave. The character could so easily have been a typical Python caricature, but with Tom Stoppard on the writing team (with Gilliam), Pryce has a lot of scope and he takes full advantage of it, producing a remarkable performance.The surreal world of Brazil closes in on Lowry as he pursues his vision, the guts of the system spilling out when things go awry. Robert de Niro's handyman terrorist adds gravitas without reneging on the style, and Bob Hoskin's ferocious comedy lends menace to the state system. Kim Greist's portrayal of Jill Layton, Lowry's desire, is more realistic. Although it could well be argued that Greist simply didn't get the style, I found her performance a useful counterpoint. Lowry's dream girl turns out to be more real, more earthed than the world he lives in.While the theme of the film will not be novel for many viewers - it's a realization of the world that often punctures adolescent minds - Brazil evinces the brutal nexus between the passionate individual and the state/status quo through a brilliantly distorted lens that accentuates the conflict. The Pythonesque tone to the look, feel and characterizations of Brazil is taken to its finest, most filmic iteration.There are some fine allusions to classic films for movie buffs, and the design is one of the film's major talking points, but for an 18 year-old lad when I first saw it, I was riven by the inhumanity of protocol, social expectations, rules and regulations in a world dominated by bureaucracy, against the fragility of romance and hope. Similarly themed '1984' might be a more powerful film, but it is also comparatively monochromatic.I barely know how to describe the effectiveness of such an overt, theatrical design that so graphically supports the themes. It is often labeled as a satire but the film is much more than this. A febrile heart emerges from the strong stylization (akin to City of Lost Children), engaging strong feeling as much as intellectual entertainment; a rare feat, owing much to Pryce's characterization. I still remember the intense mood I felt leaving the cinema after watching this nearly 30 years ago.Though Brazil borrows heavily from various styles - film-noir, satire, absurdism, surrealism, thriller, action, romance, art film - it is unique, a masterpiece that creates its own genre. It may not be to everyone's taste, but if you have a yen for something very different from the typical blockbuster, you should absolutely positively give Brazil a try. I recommend the international version, without the last scene cut. (132 or 142 minutes). Gilliam reviled the short version, which robs the story of its poignancy, emasculating the central theme. I give the long version full marks.",Brazil
504,ldehart987,Cheers to Terry Gilliam.,10,11 October 2013,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is a dark comedy that satirizes a desensitized humanity due to the frazzled and ominous bureaucratic way of life the world has come to accept. The film is set in a science fiction dystopian future and is reminiscent of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Unlike Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brazil provides much comic relief in the film. For instance, when the Department of Works is in Jill's apartment fixing her floor/Mrs. Buttle's ceiling, there is an amusing exchange of dialogue between them- ""but his name's Buttle, there must be some mistake!"" says Jill. To which the workers of the Department of Works reply, ""Mistakes? We don't make mistakes"". Immediately after, the workers drop the new piece of floor/ceiling through the original hole, clearly making a mistake. Woven and sometimes interjected into the film are these types of comical situations and anecdotes. The message conveyed by the film however, is far from comical. In fact, when we closely examine the state the world is in today and compare it to Gilliam's film, some may argue that the relevance and similarities are actually frightening. The lengths that the world's governing powers go through to maintain control are astonishing and, for the most part, largely overlooked or completely denied. By hoarding unscrupulously large amounts of collective data and purposely misinforming the public through manipulated media, our government has those, who are so complacent and in denial, hanging on their words as truths. Though this complacency exists, there are exceptions to both our world and the fictitious world in Brazil. The main character, Sam Lowry, is visited by renegade repair man Archibald ""Harry"" Tuttle. Though Tuttle's role is small, it is extremely significant, in that, Tuttle and Sam's meeting give Sam the push needed to question his ways. Overall, the film presents a very bold statement that is elaborated by set design, lighting, support characters, and a soundtrack/score that help to transport the viewer to a comical, yet despairingly dark world. When we see the infrastructure of the world in Brazil, we see dimly lit cities and bland buildings often shrouded in a fog or shadowy haze that contribute to this gloomy aura that Gilliam was expressing. But even amongst this, at times, there are support characters and scenes which reach us and make us laugh. Most of the scenes featuring Dr. Jaffe and Ida Lowry exhibit this. Sam's mother, Ida, is always ""improving"" herself through cosmetic surgeries that have been wildly exaggerated beyond what would be realistically possible (usually seeing her face during the procedures). At one point, Ida's friend in the film , who partakes in these surgeries also, exclaims, ""my complication has had a complication!"". It's whimsical moments like these that bring a chuckle or smile to the audience and ease growing tensions over the more dark elements of the film. While watching the film, it is hard not to be captivated by the bizarre scenery that is so common place for the inhabitants of the world Gilliam has created. The congestion of clutter, debris, and tubes seems almost to symbolize the congestion of our own modern bureaucracies and perhaps even provide a glimpse or hint as to where our world may be heading. There is something terribly ominous about this film, especially as it relates to the current governing powers of the world. On the other hand an inspiration is derived from taking it all in- that at least there are still some in the world who know ""we're all in this together"". Thank you for that Terry Gilliam.",Brazil
505,samanthagallegos,Brazil,7,11 October 2013,"The purpose of this movie Brazil is to convey a dystopian society by showing lack of humanity, terrorism, torture, killing, and inhuman humans striving for perfection. The director, Gilliam, does a phenomenal job in showing a dystopian society by creating strange characters like Sam Lowry's mother and her plastic surgeon, creating dark lighting, switching gender roles, and making the characters out to be in a dream like state of mind. The plastic surgery is so strange. It's proving that society strives to be inhuman and scientifically driven. These ""people"" try so hard to be perfect through youth and beauty. It's almost robotic because they don't believe in aging meaning they don't believe in life. This society is life less because everything is automated. The people, services, are all automated to do a certain thing and think a certain way. Much like the ""big-brother"" approach from Orwell's 1984. Gilliam also makes you feel like you're in a nightmare in which you can't escape by using dark and artificial lighting never truly exposing sunlight until the end of the film. This also ties into depicting their society to be mysterious and vague. The feeling of being in a nightmare continues when the director switches to Lowry's dreams back and forth creating a fantasy and an escape from a horrid society. Lowry is unambitious and a bit cowardly, yet in his dreams he is a warrior and the bravest knight in shining armour to the same angel he keeps dreaming of. When he meets the angel in real life it slaps him with ambition and courage to go after what he wants, yet the gender roles come into play when Jill is driving and melts him by being promiscuous with him as he acts very feminine towards the attention he receives while trying to tell her he loves her. This translates to making his dreams and fantasies a reality. Finally Gilliam supposedly kills off Lowry right after supposedly killing Jill giving them a chance to start anew where we see natural lighting and the first scene that isn't man made. Gilliam then comes back to Lowry being tortured, yet he's dead so it's makes the viewer question if all of it was a state of mind, a dream or reality.",Brazil
506,katherinegrainofrice,not so typical love story,8,11 October 2013,"As far as romantic storyline goes, Brazil is a typical example of the guy-chases-the-girl-until- the-girl-gives-in stereotype that most viewers are definitely familiar with. The way that love is portrayed can be seen in any other movie, and is nothing new. What is so interesting and compelling about Brazil is how the government and society correlate. In this era of dystopian future, the ""terrorists"" might not actually be the enemy, but the controlling government could be at fault. The mistake at the Ministry of Information that led to all of the radical events of the film could have easily been fixed, but to an all-powerful extremist government, the least complicated solution would be to simply kill off their problematic citizens. Lowry was trying to uncover the government's mistake and bring Buttle justice, but in order to hide their wrongdoings, the government decided to dispose of Lowry in the most nonchalant manner possible. At the beginning, Lowry was almost oblivious to the extent of the government's radical behavior. He was content enough with his simple life, and paid little attention to the outside world. When he became involved, the gradual distribution of stress and opening to the harsh reality caused the dreams to start. Lowry was starting to have to make compensation for the contentedness he was missing in his life. The dreams all had different aspects that relate back to reality, making them almost a parallel universe where Lowry could be seen as a hero. This was important for his self-esteem, without the extra motivation, he may have not been able to keep fighting for justice. Lowry is a classic example of why we need sources of reassurance and motivation to keep us on the right path. This story is an important reminder that however radical or extreme our government and society become, nothing can truly corrupt our human drive for justice.",Brazil
507,mark_field007,Exposes truths,8,11 October 2013,"This film highlights some truths about living in the real world. Some of the truths are; that the government in most countries have a strong influence in our lives whether we like it or not. They are always trying to know everything. For example in America, they have a huge library that they call the library of congress to store their knowledge. This is true in Brazil where they have a central services. In addition America uses the police to do their bidding. In Brazil they use people armed with assault rifles and the reason for that might be the fact that when Sam and his crush Jill Layton. Drive down a road where there's billboards blocking the view of the wastelands. This sort of hints to apocalyptic times and to maintain public order they employ heavily armed police.Another truth that can be observed is the amount of paper work involved in everything and the fact that they don't make mistakes according to them. In the movie scene where there is a paycheck that came back in the mail. The guy they were sending it to has passed away and the Boss said ""...we don't make mistakes"" and even suggested to Sam that it be lost behind a file cabinet or something to get rid of this letter. This suggests that they are living in denial by ignoring the reality of imperfections the world has. Maybe the government is trying to brainwash the people into thinking that there is no wasteland and nothing's wrong.The last truth I want to discuss is the excessive violence that Sam experiences in his journey to expose the government. We all know the bill of rights right? The first amendment's right to free speech. Do we really have free speech? If we say something in protest are we not arrested for no real criminal charges but a so called accusation of disturbing the peace. In Brazil, Sam was asking questions about the system and the proper paperwork required for the first time the heating engineers decided to help out after a repeating message that annoyingly said in a nutshell, we can't help you. In a lot of countries the government has they say so in what we say. In America wasn't the founding fathers thoughts about safeguarding the government from becoming really corrupt to allow the protest of our government. The purpose of the film could be to expose real world realities and to foreshadow events to come with a wasteland and a ruling party that is completely in control and to defy it means severe punishment.",Brazil
508,korylmanuel,Hero? Spoiler,7,13 October 2013,"In Brazil we follow Sam who is believed to be the ""hero"". Sam has these recurring dreams where he rescues a woman in white, who represents hope and a better future, and Sam wears dark metallic grays, which represents the mechanical futuristic world he is from. Now while he plays a brave strong man in his dream he is actually a weak desk man who wants nothing more than to stay with what he knows best. He declines all his moms promotions until one day, when he see's the girl from his dream in real life and is unable to access her criminal info do to his inferior position, he takes a promotion so he can access her files and get a little more information on her. Meanwhile he has daydreams of her getting captured and him saving her where he fights the Samurai who turns out to be himself. The Samurai represents Sam as a willing participant in the Government which he is now trying to save Jill from. When Sam finally talks to Jill he discovers she is not the delicate flower that needs protecting. She is strong, caring, and can hold her own, nothing like Sam who is weak and shows no sympathy for others. Sam tries to help Jill get away from information retrieval but causes more harm than good. He is too jumpy suspicious of everyone even Jill. When Jill asks him how many terrorist has he actually seen he says its only my first day, to which she laughs at his naive answer. He causes her to wreck the car and has caused a large amount of attention to be drawn to Jill. They go into a department store that later blows up and Sam frantically looks for Jill. When he finds her he asks is she okay which is out of character for him because in this time no one cares about anyone else's safety but their own. After discovering she was not carrying a bomb he tries to protect her from the patrol men who were trying to take her away. After being released from the patrol officers he goes back to his office to use the computer to get more information on Jills where abouts. After Sam finds Jill and takes her to his moms house he can only think of one thing that could save her. He kills her. Then later returns to her side to tell her the good news, but they are no longer looking for her. They are looking for Sam and later break into his mothers house and take him away. Unfortunately Jill really dies this time because police are allowed to use deadly force on unarmed civilians if they resist arrest. Then they reveal the interrogation process which shows all the ""terrorist"" that come through. It's discovered that terrorist is a broad term for anyone who doesn't follow the rules exactly to the letter. They torture them into submission so they won't question or try to fool the government again.

509,brad-ellin,A story of a Prisoner to the System,7,18 October 2013,"Sam (Jonathan Pryce), the Everyman of his world, yearns to be free. Free from his boring job, free from his mother's interference with his life (including his love life, such as it isn't). The job he has, his boss's reliance on him, wearing the same suit as his fellow workers day after day, the small apartment in the big block of buildings and even his new office, which more closely resembles a solitary confinement cell, are all indicative as his life as a prisoner to the system. The Government, the overwhelming bureaucracy is his Jailer. His, mother (Katherine Helmond), the Warden. He's content outwardly with his job and place in society, but inside he knows he's a prisoner. His dreams of flight, of being the brave heroic warrior freeing the maiden (Kim Greist), are his subconscious letting him know that it's aware of his plight. His interaction with Tuttle (Robert DeNiro), which may or may not be real, is his first step towards freedom. Tuttle shows him that he does not have to be a slave to the System, that he can be his own man. Tuttle's utterance of ""We're all in this together"" is Sam's subconscious trying to let him know that there is a way out. That a little (or a lot) of rebellion is liberating. There are unseen terrorists that blow up things from time to time, the governments way of keeping the population scared and dependent on them to keep the populace safe. To keep them in their cages, like animals in a zoo.The lighting in this film is done brilliantly in helping to set this mood, the tone for this story. The low lights, and the shadows created give the illusion of all the color having been sucked out of the world. It's gray. Shadows shroud practically everything, even in the day there is little light. The tall buildings that make up their city blocks most of the sunlight, casting everything in shadow. The rare occasions when a room is lit up, it's usually with harsh lighting, reminiscent of a clinic or observatory to watch lab animals. The lighting is direct and bright, an interrogators light, coaxing out a confession from a prisoner.A key element in this movie is the ducting, ever present and in the way. It is bars that make up the cage or the tether that controls their lives. The leash that confines and binds Sam and everyone else to the system. Their lives are nourished and controlled through the ducting. In some cases, like the Buttle's apartment, it's in the open. They know they live in it, they have resigned themselves to the life of living in a cage. In Sam's apartment, it's hidden in the walls, it's there, but Sam doesn't have to acknowledge it, does not have to admit he lives in a cage. Not surprisingly, in the MOI itself, there is a lack of ducting. The jailers don't need to be reminded they live and work in a prison. Except for the cleaning crew, the lower class folk. Their machines are tethered to the building (and the system) with ducting.",Brazil
510,justinv-0,Brazil,9,14 October 2013,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is an interesting film that illustrates a dystopian society filled with terrorism, complete government control, and is continually symbolic. Brazil takes place in a futuristic world dominated by a mindless and often incompetent bureaucratic government. Sam Lowrey, played by Jonathan Pryce, is a government worker who escapes the misery of his job by fantasizes that he is a superhero, rescuing a beautiful blonde haired damsel in distress. These dreams are disrupted, however, by the real world where computer malfunctions and bureaucratic policies such as ""information retrieval"" destroy the lives of innocent citizens. Sam becomes fed up as he stumbles into a nightmare world where the state of which he was once a part turns on him. Will his plastic surgery addict mother use her connections to help him? What about his best friend, small-time administrator and sometime torturer Jack? As he struggles to navigate a path to safety, everything that made his world make sense begins to unravel, as if reality itself is coming apart. Gilliam goes to great extent to create the perfect visual and feel of a dark and over-bearing dystopia. A world obstructed by technology and architecture; we rarely, if ever, see the sky or any form of plant life, bodies of water, or animals—this is an unnatural world. Orderly, yet grimy and dark with the leftovers of smokestacks and long-since-new, ever-malfunctioning mechanisms lingering like dead branches, the physical world intrudes on both the viewer and the film's characters. The film relied heavily on its characters to show the society's attributes at every level. Through the main character, Sam, we meet characters in every walk of life, each of whom abuses whatever power they have over others. The characters personalities and actions are used to symbolize these flaws and ""bugs"" in society and really carry the weight of a film that seems to have no real internal plot other than the symbolic meaning behind the things they do. If you don't go into this movie with an open mind and can't see passed the absurdities of the film you will completely miss the purpose of the whole film. It has never relevance with its symbolism of what happens as society progresses with more technology and regulation to make life easier, though through this we also create more room for error within that growth creating our own 'terror.'",Brazil
511,jp-villacreses,Horror???,8,16 October 2013,"Terry Gilliam's Brazil is a revolutionary story that contains the basic genres of romance, comedy, adventure, and even a little bit of horror. Brazil takes the viewer to a very dark and futuristic world where the government has turned into a bureaucracy. The government piling up paperwork on top of paperwork makes it impossible for anyone who may be suspicious of the government, to find out the true background on which the government may be relying on. Main character, Sam Lowry is a man who works for the ministry of information. Lowry dreams of flying through the sky and chasing a mysterious woman, who he seems to be very attracted to. He doesn't care much for what the government is doing and doesn't seem to be affected by it. But when an innocent man, Buttle, is killed, fate brings him and the woman of his dreams together in an adventure they could never even dream of. The way Gilliam created this movie is remarkable. He brings up a strong message about the government and bureaucratic societies, and levels it off with satire and romance. Everything starting from Ida Lowry's absurd obsession with cosmetic surgery to Lowry's love with Jill Layton, helps the viewer overlap the important message Gilliam is attempting to share with us. The ending of Brazil is what really grasps the attention of the audience. It leaves the audience critically thinking about the situation; and helps them understand what the characters are going through and the struggle that comes with living in such a strong and unjust society. Overall Brazil is an amazing movie that completely grasps the audience's attention from beginning to end, and leaves you thinking about the society and problems Lowry was forced to live in. It is one of those movies that leaves you pondering about it, kind of like a horror movie.",Brazil
512,acdoffing,A great film with a greatly tragic ending,8,17 October 2013,"The film Brazil touched on many interesting and relevant topics such as the government, technology and the government. However, I found that their view on what the future holds to be most interesting. The film quickly reveals the dystopian society the world has become. ""Don't suspect a friend, report him"", this resembles a common theme of distrust in one another in the film. The world is depicted as a restless place dependant on the government that is always on its toes with fear. I felt the film to be an apocalyptic tragedy with a hero (Sam Lowry) who could not win. He always shows bravery but also uncertainty. For example, ""YesNoI don't know. I don't know what I want"" he says. His mind is always debating on doing good and following the ""correct procedures"". However, he is not alone when it comes to this internal debate. All of the characters show a dependency upon technology and paperwork. They also believe that technology leads to a perfect and smoothly operated government. ""Mistakes? We don't make mistakes"", a government worker states . The dependency and belief that technology could not contain flaws leads to a fatal mistake; the death of a Mr. Buttle mistaken for Mr. Tuttle. Sam Lowry, a low-level government worker is assigned to solve the case. He meets the woman of his dreams, Jill, who is accused of terrorism for reporting the government's flaw. Sam realizes he needs to transfer to information retrieval to get close to Jill. He asks his vain and plastic surgery obsessed mother for help and he succeeds in getting the job. With the job he is able to find Jill and the two grow to like each other. However, he abuses his newfound career by retrieving Jill's information and adjusting her files to make it appear that she is actually dead to protect her from arrest. The government makes the discovery of Sam's treason and he is hunted down by armed workers. Sam is taken unconsciously to a government building where he is then restrained to a chair in a room where he is to be tortured. He then learns that in a resistance to arrest Jill has unfortunately been killed. A masked friend of his is set to torture him. Just before torture commences Tuttle and his allies shoot down the torturer and rescue Sam. They escape and many odd and chilling scenes are shown. In the end it is realized that the entire escape was a dream of Sam's as he hallucinates. He is shown again back in the chair restrained, appearing delusional humming the movies theme song ""Brazil"" and the film ends.The ending is sad and leaves you longing for the happy ending seen in the alternate version of the film. On the other hand I found the ending to be my favorite part of this film and to me this tragic ending was more impacting for me. He attempts at being a hero and does not succeed but he is still seen as brave and a dreamer. He loses the woman of his dreams and is to be confined for the rest of his life. Like any great film should the ending leaves you wondering.",Brazil
513,kristy-ahrens-823-494762,A true dystopian society,9,21 October 2013,"Dystopian stories have always intrigued me - from Brave New World to 1984, it is so hard to not love how society can be messed up in however many years. Brazil presents a whole new perspective to the idea of a dystopian society: a world that is run by technology and cosmetic surgeries galore, letting the citizens act as if they are free. Terry Gilliam was inspired to make this film in the 1980s by the state that Britain was in during the time. The world of Brazil is completely grim and colorless: the state that the poor live in is unbearable yet the rich thrive with extravagant parties (mostly to show off their plastic surgeries). The poor bathe themselves in black water, live in cramped apartments, and live in fear of the government who rely on machines that can barely function correctly. Sam Lowry, portrayed by Jonathan Pryce, is a man who fights an internal struggle with the government. He lives pretty well, he is a file clerk, and his has high status within society. However, he is often dreaming of saving a girl from the clutches of machines and dead people - he craves adventure, he does not confide in the government, and in reality he is the biggest coward ever. Jill Layton, portrayed by Kim Greist, is the complete opposite. Sam finds his dream girl but she is not a damsel in the bit. She is fearless, she is rebellious, she is a truck driver: Jill is someone who is not afraid of anything that is thrown at her. In spite of this, Sam continues to be enamored over her but his chances of getting with her are eventually crushed because of the government's intervention. Brazil is unique entirely because of the characters as well as how eerily similar the society is today. While dystopian fiction focuses on what could happen, Brazil contains elements that are already similar today. From consumerism, the lack of human morale, and how people are obsessed with looking completely young, it is almost as if the film is pointing directly toward its audience. It is truly interesting considering this film was made in the 80's and is still so relevant. Brazil presents a pervasive and manipulative society, a complete nightmare for anyone that lives in it. Gilliam is a genius with the cinematography: it is a film that is so colorless yet the natural lighting in some scenes provides the viewer with some hope that these characters somehow make it. The way the camera is angled at some points is almost comical. Gilliam's social commentary is intertwined beneath the British satire and humor, and some scenes are downright horrifying. It is definitely a film that should be given a shot, despite how odd it is.",Brazil
514,jgs_co_star,Brazil--Comments by a Gilliam Fan A Little Too Late.,10,12 July 2005,"Either I am one of the darkest people ever or this was not one of the darkest movies ever made as its own packaging claims. I have vowed to myself not to use the following words: Orwellian or futuristic, though I had to use that sentence to get them out and make room for free, original thought. First, of course, thoughts on Gilliam (again, just to make room). When I first saw anything of his it was on Monty Python when I was twelve so obviously it was an animation and more than a little off-putting (only because I was twelve though). It was not until I was eighteen that I realized what I had been seeing was something I should have put more focus on and paid more attention to as I had recently had a revelation of wanting to be a filmmaker myself. I cursed myself when I found out he had directed actual things and found myself two years later watching Brazil for the first time after succumbing to a new-found love of Gilliam's directorial style and creativity (which I can find some of my own style in from time to time) and after freaking out quite a lot (quietly) in a used bookstore (sorry, Terry no money for new stuff now) about an obscenely cheap price I thought I would never get after being disappointed that same day about not having Time Bandits in my hands at the moment. The first thing which always strikes me about any Gilliam film is the soundtrack because music is one of the major distractions which took my mind off things like him when it shouldn't have all those years ago. They are always totally original and never what I had expected while being completely not what I would have used or even thought of (all these statements are bearing in mind that I know this particular soundtrack is original anyway). I am thinking also of 12 Monkeys when Blueberry Hill was playing in the car which is a constant source of contemplation since the day I saw it first. I know I should say that the visuals should strike me most because of the sheer volume of them but quite frankly, I don't notice volumes of pictures flashing as rapidly in front of me as much as others might because I tend to get bored very easily if there are not constant changes and therefore I found the visuals to be just right for me. I loved them of course, very colorful and clever and a world in which I got lost in very, very easily. I did have to think quite a bit about some of the jokes but, luckily for me, I have the special edition and on the second disc one of the writers said that Gilliam had to think about one of the same jokes! And that it was one that the other writer had put in so I felt very much better. Storyline was another story so to speak compared to visuals. I had a lot moreactually I'm still having trouble figuring it out. I always find that the best time for writing anything is right after a film of his because it really wakes me up. I don't know if this has anything to do with the story or what it is--just energy I think. I did like the character of Jack (Micheal Palin) and how he kept popping back in when I thought I wouldn't get to see him anymore. That's just about all I can say about the story if anybody else has any thoughts on this point I would love an e-mail.",Brazil

516,ghettoyou,A masterpiece,10,13 February 2015,"..The great thing about Brazil is that it is such an original piece of art; it tells it's tale in the most dreamy of ways; in an retro-styled futuristic atmosphere, with both light-hearted humor, piquant drama/romance, splendid camera-work with some smart angles, delightful bright colors and a thrilling sensation of epic mystique. It's even got some swell actors, delivering quite the performances! (Astonishing Jonathan Pryce as the main character, as well as: Robert De Niro, Ian Holm, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, Peter Vaughan and beautiful Kim Greist, as an significant supporting actor). Not going to tell you what they do or how how they do it, this just needs to be watched....What also fascinated me is that the story and scenery takes so many turns and twists -when you believe it's coming to an end- there's still more behind the upcoming corner. Stunning visuals and plot-continuum's you did not expect.Terry Gilliam always manage to crawl under my skin; make me marvel, feel, think in ways I didn't think before; bringing forth deep thoughts from within the depths of my subconscious, see details in- and philosophize within new perspectives.. and of course giving me some of that extra energy to my juvenile imagination.Love it.**Also; all regards to the novel ""1984"", and its maker George Orwell; which this piece is heavily based on. Heard it was meant to be called 1984½ at first by Gilliam. But fortunately he made his own thing out of it, and I just love the title, and intro song; ""Brazil"".",Brazil
517,uselessmuffin,"once brilliant, now depressing",9,21 June 2021,"More of a commentary than a review. I'm sure the audiences of the 80s had a blast with this movie, as the art direction, editing, acting, etc. Are all brilliant. I watched it just to say I have watched it, fully knowing that dystopian is not my thing. Things in the movie that were funny/clever to my parents were depressingly realistic. I know that objectively speaking it's a great movie, I just feel like anyone under 35 is not going to like it because of the vastly different context we grew up in; the movie really feels ridiculously close to home for me. Still, masterfully done. Kinda wish I was born earlier so I could enjoy this movie.",Brazil
518,hikaru_gema,A Nightmarish Satire of the Future,9,20 July 2005,"""Brazil"" assaults your senses from beginning to end. There are many things going on at one time in some scenes that you have to be quick to notice the homages, the visual references, and rather dark humor in the movie. Actually, the whole tone of the film is dark and bleak. Gilliam's portrayal of the future is one of the most unique visions I've seen. It's like a combination of industrial design, factories, art deco, steam age, gears and cogs, and the whole sh'bang. Pipes travel through everything and everywhere, and there's always the presence of dread. Then there's the dream sequences, which truly are dreamlike. The flying scenes, the prisoners in the monolithic halls, the Giant computer-chip samurai, and the doll-faced death figures all leave impressions in your mind. But enough about style, what about the film itself? Needless to say, it's a satire, and he hammers it home ten ways from Sunday. The coldness of people, the absurdity of one's actions, the whole Bureaucratic system, etc. It all comes together in a surreal vision called ""Brazil"".""Brazil"" tells the story of a regular bureaucratic employee named Sam, who earns his daily bread and works from day to day. He also has fantastic visions in his mind, which mirror reality. Then, a stupid mistake occurs. A worker kills a fly and it falls into a machine, screwing up the names of someone's arrest. A simple mistake sends Sam into a nightmare world. He tries to correct the error in which a man was wrongfully arrested and was killed in the torture chamber. (more about that later) As Sam progresses through the world we see many things: terrorist bombings, his mother getting plastic surgery while another woman is slowly deteriorating, things never getting done due to too much paperwork, a promotion he never wanted, and his dreams colliding with reality. He meets many characters, and in his madness, he begins to have pre-conceived notions. It's these notions that fuel the nightmare he's trapped in. There are many meanings, and it may need several viewings to catch them all. The sets are gorgeous, and the humor, while scathing and sometimes cruel, fit the scenes perfectly, such as the incorrect arrest of the wrong man, as the official goes through the procedure rather clinically and presents to the man's wife a receipt, showing the cost of her husband. It's not to be mistaken for a laugh-out loud comedy, for there are some powerful scenes in the film that may be hard to sit through. There is one rather noticeable inconsistecny, that being the romance with Sam and the girl of his dreams.(literally) It seems too sudden, but it doesn't matter, the rest of the film resonates finely. So I recommend it to all sci-fi fans and film-lovers. It will make you think for awhile, and also get the song ""Brazil"" stuck in your head.",Brazil
519,abdullahh-40841,Must watch late at night and sleepy,9,19 April 2015,"The first time I watched this movie I couldn't believe it. I finally found a movie that really talks to me. why? The dream sequences, the bottomless tall buildings, the weird camera angles and even the story. I try to tell everyone about it, so I can see how did they interpreted it after watching it. I never got a similar answers, not even close. The acting is brilliant. The characters are unique. Even the name of the movie made me think. It reminds me a lot of my dreams when I was young. I really recommend watching it late at night and sleepy. Or any other state that you prefer. It's one of those movies you hope they never remake, because the unique charm may never be recaptured.",Brazil
520,wildlifecr13,Orwell vs Brazil,8,30 June 2005,"While there are a lot of similarities between Brazil and Orwell's work, many on this site have made one big mistake. Brazil is NOT about a FUTURE world, it was his view of the current world. It was how he saw things at that time and place, Orwell on the other hand looked to a bleak future. Besides this, most folks have caught on to the major themes, etc of this movie. I too would have seen it as a future world, but we have been studying movies, including this one, in my masters program for public administration. We have discussed this as a present day world, which makes it even more interesting to watch. Hope this sheds some light on the video for everyone.",Brazil
521,adamthepugh,My Favorite film of all time,10,5 July 2005,"Terry Gilliams classic was first shown to me in my first college class in 1999. The class was about deviance and violence in society, so this film fit quite well within those parameters. As a piece of art by itself the photography in this film is beautiful which is accented by the great score. This film was way ahead of its time for forward thinking film-making and story telling. Now over 20 years later is still gives you a sense of despair, hope and a dream that love does conquer all. The idea of the ducts in the movie really hits home the idea that the government really does have its hands in everything we do. We are all connected by one common theme or idea, and sometimes those ideas are not good ones, or they break and need some readjusting. When that happens there are only certain types of people who feel they should be able to work on the ""ducts"" and anyone else must be an impostor. A dark cinematic feat that I would categorize all of Gilliam's movies in. 12 monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and the Fisher King are fantastic films as well.Let's hope Gilliam keeps up the work in the new film ""The Brothers Grimm.""",Brazil
522,yb777,"Visually excellent,but weak on plot",7,24 October 2005,"I've just finished watching ""Brazil"",the movie that I've heard so much praise about and have been looking for it to see for a long time.Well,I wouldn't say that it is bad.On the other hand I wouldn't call it a masterpiece,too.Maybe just Terry Gilliam's masterpiece,which is a bit different thing.It is visually stunning and the acting of Jonathan Price is excellent as well as of some others involved.Camera work is brilliant,too.With what I wouldn't agree is that the movie has ""intellectual depth"",""hidden messages"" and its themes are ""thought provoking"".There is nothing too much of something thought provoking here and the movie's humor is rather flat.The story of a love affair being endangered by the autocratic regime of some future state is much better shown in ""1984"" whose stylization this film is.For those seeking for real intellectual depth or ""provoked thinking"" I would heartily recommend ""Winter Light"",Autumn Sonata"",""Wild Strawberies"",""Cries And Whispers"" by Ingmar Bergman,""Sacrifice"" and ""Solaris"" by Andrey Tarkovski,""Bad Sleep Well"" and ""High And Low"" by Kurosava,""Red Desert"" and ""Night"" by Michelangelo Antonioni,""Veronika Voss"" and ""Marta"" by Rainer Fassbinder...",Brazil
523,cody-willming,"A man who faces a world where nothing works and society has degraded so much that it is rotting on the paper it was built on, finds his only escape through his imagination.",10,21 November 2005,"I love this movie. Terry Gilliam is a genius. While Brazil is definitely not an uplifting movie, it is fascinating and just mind-boggling. While it can be argued that this is a very depressing movie, and seeing as how Universal made Terry Gilliam make a more happy ending for it, the original ending was in its own way a happy ending.Johnothan Pryce plays a man who is constantly sub-merged in society's chaos, but his only way to escape is through his mind, where he builds a world where he is a hero and is in love with a beautiful girl. All of this is constantly switching from his dreams to reality in the movie, but he finally just lives completely in his dreams at the end of the movie because that is his only escape. So in a way, while ""society"" is still declining and destroying itself through paper, greed, and regulations, it does have a happy ending because he escapes to happiness through his mind.This is definitely not all to the movie, in fact there is so much to see in Brazil that it would take me days to type all of it. There is also a lot of black humor in it, and some times you don't want to laugh because its really sad in a way, you can't help it. This movie is definitely not for those who like nice happy feel good movies. It is depressing, but amazes you with its brilliance.",Brazil
524,edenphd,"Had Shakespeare written science fiction, this would be it",10,24 November 2005,"Terry Gilliam directed a classical dystopia: A trip to the grizzly English version of Orwell's 1985. Filmed in 1980, the futuristic setting is dominated by unsettlingly-familiar contraptions which malfunction in the most bizarre ways. The plot is driven by the arbitrariness of the behaviour of information processing systems our society heavily relies on anytime an error occurs. Reality in the future British Kingdom is creepier than the unworldly scenes conjured by any other good science fiction.Jonathan Pierce fights megalomaniacal bureaucracy, oppressive society, his overbearing rich mother (the divine Katherine Helmond), the ghost of his father, and the enemies of true love with help from Robert De-Niro only entering with the occasional superhero stunt. Clever metaphors, stunning scenes, and choice actors make the first viewing a bliss. Umpteen subtleties in dialogues and in the visual setting will keep you at the edge of your seat during second and third viewing. Had Shakespeare written science fiction, this would be it.",Brazil
525,rickflair,A Flight,10,15 November 2006,"Excuse me for my English... Brazil is really a state of mind. A state, in which a man would like to have wings and fly in the clouds. Like a bird, a giant, but graceful bird with no troubles, because it is above the problems of the everyday... There are, in my opinion, too many films about facts and figures, and a small number of cinematic pieces that know how you feel every time you spend some time on watching them. I think that ""Brazil"" isn't a movie about the fight against totalitarianism - it's much more about the dreams, the visions, the flights of imagination... That's why ""Brazil"" has a happy end - because our hero was able to fly, to escape the horrible reality... So watching this movie really convinced me that a man shouldn't be afraid to dream, because dreaming, flying and plumbing can set you free...1000 out of 10",Brazil

527,Pa_ag,The perfect satire,9,26 May 2020,"Gilliam is not a director that appeals to everyone (I can clearly see why this is) but if you are open-minded enough and agree to be taken in a wild ride, then Brazil is the film for you. It is a satire of our modern day world and its meaningless bureaucracy. Some would argue that the film is too long and even boring at times but I would have to disagree, every scene in this movie is packed with amazing imagery and symbolism as well as an insane plot which will keep you interested at all times. If there is someone that knows how to do comedy/satire of this sort its Gilliam, I am even willing to say this is one of the best satires ever created.After you finish the movie you are left with an eerie feeling that I cant exactly describe, it is as if the world you live in is just as mad as the one in Brazil and the routine you follow is slowly driving you crazy. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of good cinema and is willing to be submerged in the crazy mind of Terry Gilliam.",Brazil
528,liyi-73190,A colossal piece of dread,1,16 January 2019,"This two and a half hour long movie took our class three 75 minute classes to watch, and it was absolutely dreadful. I am writing this review so that no one has to go through the pain of ever watching this movie. The entire plot was just simply boring and the music was so cheesy everytime the track played I just wanted to bang my head on their table. I don't know why this kind of a film would be considered appropriate for students to watch in a classroom setting. The characters were uninspiring and uninteresting, and I fell asleep during two of the three classes. The reason why I did not fall asleep during the third class was because I was practicing Chinese calligraphy, since that is more worth my time than whatever the monstrosity of a film playing on the TV was.",Brazil

The movie tried to make it a comedy, a drama, and a half dozen other genres, it failed at everything. It is a terrible movie, not only terrible but long as well. It's so uniquely bad that once you start it you can't turn it off (and that's worse than it just being flat-out bad). Do yourself a favor and DO NOT rent this movie. The movie is dated, cheesy, grating and silly. They attempt to take the short-comings of modern western sociality (vanity, materialism, inability to think independently, irrational fear) and short-comings of a modern bloated government (soullessness, inefficiency, long lines, red tape, and paperwork) and magnify them into urban hell. The characters all seemed lonely and broken but it was difficult to sympathize with them (close but not quite). Watching this film made me go through the five stages of grief, in the final half-hour I reached acceptance, this movie is awful.",Brazil
