0,MartinHafer,Wow...how did I forget to review this great film?!,10,19 October 2010,"While I am sure that there is a lot of debate on this issue, but I'd say that this is Alfred Hitchcock's best film. It combines a marvelously original script with romance and wonderful location shooting to make a truly fabulous film.I love how this film begins. Ordinary New Yorker Cary Grant (or at least as ordinary as any guy looking like that can be) goes out to mail a letter and, through a long string of mistakes, becomes entangled in an assassination plot! The problem is that at first the police don't believe him about some weird plot--then they assume HE is responsible for the killing! The film is chock full of crazy iconic scenes--such as Grant being pursued by an evil crop duster and Grant and Eva Marie Saint scaling down the faces on Mt. Rushmore to escape the killers. Along the way, Hitchcock goes crazy with very, very sexual Freudian imagery (the tunnel scene is a classic) and provides some wonderful moments using wonderful actors. Grant, as always, is great but I also liked Martin Landau's small role as a killer who REALLY likes his job and the rest of the cast is also stellar. This is a must-see film and one of the best films of the decade.By the way, this film, despite being so wonderful also has one of my favorite film mistakes--and I am sure to watch for it every time. In the scene at the UN, pay very, very close attention when Grant tries to talk to the man he is pursuing. Although the man is shot dead unexpectedly right next to Grant, apparently one of the extras (a kid in the foreground) is anticipating the shooting before the gun has even been drawn. Look carefully--the kid is plugging his ears well before the shot occurs!!!",North by Northwest
1,TheLittleSongbird,Enormously entertaining film from Alfred Hitchcock!,9,9 June 2009,"My favourite director, Alfred Hitchcock has directed many classics like Psycho, Rear Window and Vertigo, and I will say that this deserves to be up there among his best. I absolutely loved it! The best aspect of this movie is the always charming Cary Grant in a brooding and entertaining performance as Roger Thornhill, a man wanted for the murder of a diplomat. Solidly supporting him all the way are the lovely Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendell and oily James Mason as the villainous Vandamme. They are further advantaged by some excellent camera-work and a wonderfully atmospheric music score. The script is focused and suspenseful, and Hitchcock's direction ensures the film rarely slips, even if some of the complicated plot does fly over people's heads. The climax though is simply the icing on the cake. Overall, a hugely enjoyable film, which I will give a 9.5/10. Bethany Cox",North by Northwest
2,bkoganbing,"""War Is Hell, Even When It's A Cold One.""",10,1 September 2006,"Following up on his two previous masterpieces, The Thirty Nine Steps and Saboteur; Alfred Hitchcock put together his ultimate chase film with elements of both coming into Ernest Lehman's screenplay. I've seen figures that show in terms of box office and later video sales and rentals, North By Northwest was Hitchcock's most successful film financially.At this point Alfred Hitchcock's name over the title could sell a movie, but I'm sure he didn't mind having Cary Grant in it to draw the movie going public. This was Cary's fourth and final appearance in a Hitchcock film and I think it is his best performance in one.Like in the two films I cited, Cary is innocently caught up in a web of intrigue and he got there by just answering a telephone page at a hotel dining room. He took a call right after someone paged a George Kaplan and the bad guys think he's Kaplan. And he gets grabbed.It's a devilishly difficult situation for him because there ain't no George Kaplan. He's a fictitious guy who was invented by one of our spy agencies (that's never identified in the story)to take the heat off an agent very close to masterspy James Mason. Mason tries to murder Grant by getting him drunk and putting him behind the wheel of a car. Later on Grant gets framed for murder while trying to find out what's going on and he's on the run from New York to Chicago to Rapid City and the Mount Rushmore monument.James Mason plays the cultured villain Philip Van Dam. Mr. Mason who had some of the most precise diction heard this side of Ronald Colman on screen, could play villain and hero and a lot in between equally well. Among other things he's a bi-sexual and his henchman/boyfriend Martin Landau is jealous of his involvement with Eva Marie Saint. With the Code still firmly in place, it was quite daring for Mason to refer to Landau's suspicions as his 'woman's intuition.Eva Marie Saint joins the list of cool and fiery blonds Hitchcock was so partial to for his films. I'm surprised he never used Eva Marie again, she seemed the perfect successor for Grace Kelly who if she hadn't become a princess would have been playing this part for sure.Bernard Herrman who wrote the acclaimed score for Hitchcock's Vertigo followed that up with an equally good score. Especially during the moments of Grant's tangle with a crop duster plane and the chase across the Mount Rushmore Monument, Herrman made great use of music to help the audience feel the tension. It's a great instrumental piece, violins that seem to pound with a drum counterpoint. The best kind of film music.And why wouldn't it be because North By Northwest is some of the best kind of film making.",North by Northwest
3,Leofwine_draca,They sure as heck don't make 'em like this anymore!,10,6 September 2016,"This Hitchcock crowd-pleaser might well be the director's best film: it's certainly his most accessible, a roller-coaster ride of thrills and spills that includes just about every element you'd want in a thriller. There are exciting chase sequences, huge set-pieces, subterfuge, sinister villains, a romance with a femme fatale, and a dashing star playing an innocent man attempting to clear his name. In many ways this looks and feels like a Bond film, so much so that you could call it proto-Bond; our hero travels around, outwitting the bad guys yet remaining smooth and cool when it comes to the ladies. But this is far better than any of the Bond flicks! Hitchcock is at the top of his game, delivering a movie in which the direction is flawless. Every scene counts and every scene plays out like a little movie in itself. Cary Grant clearly relishes the role and he's perfectly cast in it; Ernest Lehman's script never disappoints. Eva Marie Saint is more than effective as the icy yet fragile mystery woman and James Mason excels as a suave bad guy. I also enjoyed seeing Martin Landau's early turn as a henchman.The crop-duster set-piece is rightly well-remembered, as it's the best part of the film: intensely exciting and perfectly directed. The finale at Mount Rushmore is fittingly thrilling, too, but before then we get many splendid moments: the cat and mouse games on the train, the bit at the station beforehand, the runaway car. It's hardly dated and has nothing in it I'd change; a quite wonderful movie. It's true when they say ""they don't make 'em like this anymore!"".",North by Northwest
4,SnoopyStyle,Great wild convoluted fun ride,8,27 September 2014,"Madison Avenue ad executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a spy named George Kaplan. He is kidnapped and brought to the estate of Lester Townsend. He is interrogated by foreign spy Philip Vandamm (James Mason). His associate Leonard (Martin Landau) tries to set him up for a fatal accident. He manages to survive but the police doesn't believe him when he tells them the story. It also turns out that Townsend is an UN diplomat. He goes to the UN general assembly to track down Townsend. Vandamm kills Townsend and Thornhill becomes the fall guy for the murder. It turns out that George Kaplan is a fictional spy created by the government to divert attention away from the real agent. On the run from the police, he boards the 20th Century Limited train bound for Chicago. On board, he meets Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who assists him in hiding from the cops. Then it's another twist when he finds out that Eve is working for Vandamm and Leonard. It's a long winding adventure that ends on top of Mt. Rushmore.This is one convoluted story. Hitchcock is able to keep it going by the talents of Cary Grant and the audacity to keep piling on the twists. Cary Grant is a fun leading man. His charm is overflowing and he handles the wild story with great skill. Eva Marie Saint is a great Hitchcock blonde. This is simply a fun roller-coaster ride with the music, the style, and the non-stop thrills.",North by Northwest
5,Hitchcoc,Suspense from Beginning to End,10,5 May 1999,"There is something comforting about a Hitchcock film.  We know that no matter how serious the events are, there is a wonderfully complex plot, comic relief, and great actors to pull it all off.  The spoiled, inebriated Roger Thornhill, like so many of the master's everymen, finds himself thrust into a world he must escape, while, at the same time, trying to figure it all out.  His arrogance is what gets him deeper and deeper into trouble, but it is also what saves him.  Cary Grant is the only actor I could think of who is so suave and yet so combative and self centered.  As he realizes what is happening he must constantly face death, while being manipulated by the powers that be. He is being set up, he knows, but by whom?  Enter Eva Marie Saint, but knowing Hitchcock, she is to be watched carefully as well. Most of Hitchcock's ""victims"" reach a point where they won't take any more.  I love the way Thornhill has been put in a predicament where he has no confederates and must remain underground.  Everyone back home thinks he is the irresponsible drunk he truly is.  Even his mother isn't to surprised to find out he may be a murderer.  The use of settings around Rapid City, Mount Rushmore, all the Hitchcock signatures, make this one of the best, if not the best, if all his films.",North by Northwest
6,Prismark10,North by Northwest,7,10 October 2020,"Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest is regarded as laying the footprints for the modern spy action thrillers such as James Bond.The movie is well known for its iconic action scenes. Cary Grant being chased by a crop duster plane and the scenes on Mount Rushmore.Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is a suave advertising executive in New York who gets mistaken for George Kaplan during the cold war.The villains who trade in secrets with a foreign power want to kill Kaplan. The trouble for Thornhill is that Kaplan is a made up operative. He has been created to expose the bad guys led by smooth but deadly Phillip Vandamm (James Mason.)After a death at the UN building, Thornhill is wanted for murder and is on the run. On a train he meets Eve (Eva-Marie Saint) who helps him out but she seems to have her own agenda.Thornhill has no idea what is going on, why the villains are trying to kill him and what is Eve up to.If you actually miss the early portion of the film and see the scenes between Thornhill and Eve. You would think you have walked into a romantic comedy rather than an espionage thriller.North by Northwest effortless switches genres to take advantage of Grant's forte for light comedy. At its heart, this is an escapist action movie.The villains motives though seem hazy. While Vandamm is urbane, his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) hiding a gay subtext is chillingly cold. They go through some convoluted lengths to finish off Thornhill. Maybe this was another inspiration for the Bond movies.The Professor (Leo G Carroll) tries to provide an explanation as to what is going on. MGM the studio who made this film were right. The film is too long and needed some judicious snipping. There is too much blue screen, at one point during the train journey the background is in sepia. Even the Mount Rushmore scenes look like studio set.",North by Northwest
7,claudio_carvalho,Another Hitchcock's Masterpiece,10,4 September 2004,"In a business lunch in a hotel in New York, the advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is wrongly identified as being the American spy George Kaplan by the foreigners agents Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his right arm Leonard (Martin Landau). Roger is kidnapped and Vandamm's men try to simulate an accident for killing him. Roger escapes, but sooner is accused of murdering a diplomat in the UN building. With the police and the foreigners spies chasing him, Roger meets and has a crush with Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Later, he will be advised that George Kaplan indeed does not exist, and he agrees to act like a bait to rescue Eve from Phillip and his men. This movie is another masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock. The story, full of comedy, action, thriller and romance, is delightful. Cary Grant is amazing in the role of Roger Thornhill and Eva Marie Saint is extremely beautiful and sexy. The actions scenes are breathless and outstanding, highlighting the one with the plane and the pursuit in the rock mountains. A wonderful movie recommended for the whole family. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'Intriga International' ('International Intrigue')",North by Northwest
8,kosmasp,Way to go,9,8 May 2020,"When is a spy a spy? And is the audience going to be able to tell if he is or isn't before it is revealed? And when will it be revealed? All those things make room for suspense, edge of your seat stuff. Cary Grant plays it as suave as one can play it - and the dry humor is just spot on (call the police anyone?). So the backdrops are obvious as with most of his movies, but that shouldn't bother you at all. We are talking about other things that will and should interest you way more than that little ""flaw"".The movie may feel a tad bit too long for some, but there is always something going on. And the way he edited some scenes is holding up quite nicely - something that not all movies that have action or stunt scenes can attest from that time period. And then there is that plane scene ... it is a bit of plot hole how we get there (or rather a character inconsistency, maybe even aplliable to at least 2 characters considering what they themselves are saying or doing) ... but normally you will not mind or care. This is light and fun and very identifiable",North by Northwest
9,classicsoncall,"""Games, must we?""",9,10 November 2006,"When you come right down to it, the title ""North By Northwest"" tells you nothing about the story, but it certainly rolls off the tongue a lot better than ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose"" as the movie was originally known. The official title comes from Hamlet - ""I am but mad north-north-west"". Fortunately, a scene at the airline's ticket counter lends some semblance of credibility to the northwest connection.What had me going was how the film managed to keep up with the pretense of a phony George Kaplan, to the point where Cary Grant's character winds up becoming the impostor. Grant was a Hitchcock favorite, and the role here was written with him in mind, even though MGM wanted Gregory Peck in the lead. I don't know if Peck could have pulled off the auction scene the same way as Grant. His roles portraying slick hustlers like Walter Burns in ""His Girl Friday"" or the more sinister Johnnie Asgarth in another Hitchcock effort ""Suspicion"", more than readied him to pull off the stunt and get away with it.Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is clearly a duplicitous character, one gets the impression that maybe Roger Thornhill (Grant) is just a bit too good for her. Hitch's penchant for beautiful blonds in his films gets the royal treatment here, Saint is radiant in nearly all her scenes, made more so by the bright red of her outfit on the train.You know, I could listen to James Mason speak all day, he's got that great resonant quality to his voice. Casting him as the villain lends immediate credibility to the bad guy cause in the story. Martin Landau appears in one of his first film roles as Mason's henchman. I always enjoy seeing Leo G. Carroll in a film, probably because of my fondness for his role in the early TV series ""Topper"". Here he appears cast somewhat against type as The Professor heading up an unknown agency that attempts to take down Vandamm's (Mason) subversive little clique. It was actually a bit chilling to see The Professor willing to let the cards fall as they may as relating to Thornhill's dilemma.If done today, I'm sure the whole Mount Rushmore scene would be presented to look a lot more believable; the way Thornhill prevails requires a stretch of the imagination. But by that time, I found myself saying 'who cares', because the thrill ride was worth it to see Grant come away the hero. Hitch pulls it off with that neat device at the end of the story so we don't get caught up in the whole cliff hanger ending ordeal. It's a clever little happy ending to an espionage tale that might have suffered in less capable hands, but here director Hitchcock keeps you on your toes and the edge of your seat in a way that delivers the goods.",North by Northwest
10,gavin6942,"Not My Favorite Hitchcock, But A Classic For a Reason",8,16 March 2010,"A Madison Avenue advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is mistaken for a Mr. George Kaplan and kidnapped by thugs Valerian (Adam Williams) and Licht (Robert Ellenstein). He is taken to the house of Lester Townsend on Long Island. There he is interrogated by a man he assumes to be Townsend, but who is really Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). When Thornhill repeatedly denies he is Kaplan and says he cannot cooperate, Vandamm orders his right-hand man Leonard (Martin Landau) to get rid of him.This is a classic tale of mistaken identity -- perhaps the classic tale. And it has a few twists in store, so if that mix-up wasn't enough to keep the mystery going, there's a few more surprises in store.Eva Marie Saint appears as Thornhill's partner in fake crime, in a much more outgoing role than her reserved ""On the Waterfront"" persona. I like her... I can't place why, but she's a solid actress and I think underused.""North by Northwest"" is considered one of the greatest films ever made and the greatest Hitchcock of all. I admit, there's plenty of great scenes and the acting is hard to beat... Cary Grant, James Mason and Martin Landau in one picture? Oh, and that climactic Mount Rushmore conflict... but I don't know. I wouldn't say it's my favorite. Maybe not even in my top three. I'm more of a murder mystery guy, I guess.Or maybe I'm just not big on Cary Grant... hmmm. A great film, to be sure... do see it. I just cannot put my full endorsement behind it in comparison to other Hitchcock, despite what all the critics say.",North by Northwest
11,lee_eisenberg,it's not just Cary Grant getting chased by the crop-duster...,10,19 June 2005,"A common theme in Alfred Hitchcock's movies was chaos: collapsing innocence in ""Shadow of a Doubt"", getting drug into a murder plot in ""Strangers on a Train"", the possible murder in ""Rear Window"", the shower scene in ""Psycho"", or the avians' unexplained killing spree in ""The Birds"". But more specific than simply chaos, is getting falsely accused of something, as happens in ""North by Northwest"". Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an executive who gets mistaken for someone else. When he tries to avoid involvement, they set him up by murdering someone at the United Nations. Now he's on the run, and can trust only Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).Almost as famous as the crop-duster scene is the Mt. Rushmore scene. The way that one might interpret that scene is not what happens there, but what the monument itself represents. It shows past presidents, as if to represent the highest authority, as the UN scene might have been doing.Another interesting scene is the auction. If you look at how Eve is dressed and how she is seated, you notice that she is sort of like the colorful halfway point between two drab points, represented by two men (maybe that's just my interpretation). And of course Eva Marie Saint was one of Hitchcock's ""icy blondes"", much like Grace Kelly, Doris Day, Kim Novak, Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren.Once again, Hitch proved himself to be a master director.",North by Northwest
12,jboothmillard,North by Northwest,10,13 September 2005,"I had no idea what was going on the first time I saw this ""classic masterpiece"" from the great Sir Alfred Hitchcock, but paying much closer attention the second time I can see why it is given that title. Basically Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) has ended a normal day of work, and suddenly he is abducted at gunpoint by two henchmen mistaking him for a government agent named George Kaplan. After meeting their boss (unknown for the moment), he is intoxicated and put driving in a car. He manages to escape charges, as long as he can prove his innocence, so he is now following all leads and clues that can lead either back to the abductors, or this ""Kaplan"". Many crimes happen around him, and he is photographed as being the key suspect, but he manages to find a friendly girl, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) on a train, who is instantly attracted to him and says she will help him with his search for answers. At one point Kaplan passes a message to meet Roger on an almost remote road with some crop fields, and this sees one of the most memorable scenes, with him being attacked by the crop dusting plane. After escaping this, he heads to the hotel where he believes Kaplan is staying, and there he finds Eve again, and this is when he starts suspecting she is part of the act. He is right, there is a point that the villains he met before are with her. But he eventually meets The Professor (Leo G. Carroll) who reveals she is working for the government agency trying to find out information about them stealing microfilm secrets, oh, and also that Kaplan is fictional, it's Eve. The conclusion of the film sees Roger going to the house where the villain, Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), and his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) are staying, near the Mount Rushmore monument, and this sees the second most memorable scene, climbing all over the four presidents (LOL). In the end the villains fall to their deaths, the microfilm is recovered, and Roger and Eve are newlyweds. Also starring Jessie Royce Landis as Clara Thornhill, and Hitchcock's cameo is the man missing a bus. Grant is fantastically charming, the direction is impeccable, and it is just a film you can't miss. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Cary Grant was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 19 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 4 on Britain's Finest Actors, he was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, and he was number 23 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 7 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Outstanding!",North by Northwest
13,ccthemovieman-1,Okay....But It Seemed A Lot Better When I Was A Kid,6,9 April 2006,"When I started collecting videos in earnest (by the thousands), I was excited to get this film. I had such fond remembrances of seeing it on the big screen when I was young teen. I remember being terrified when Cary Grant was being chased by the crop duster and then awed at the end with the climactic scene on Mount Rushmore. I saw it maybe a decade or so later on television and enjoyed it again.Well, seeing the film again five years ago on DVD as a 50-something-year-old turned out to be a major disappointment, mainly because the first hour was so boring. The beginning had scenes that looked too dated and worse, were drawn out too long, such as Grant's drunk scene and the romance between he and Eva Marie Saint.Once Grant goes on the run, the story improves noticeably and mixing in some comedy with the drama was a good move. From that point, it's still the fun film I had remembered but, overall, didn't have the suspense anymore and, to this day, I believe is an overrated Alfred Hitchcock film. The more I see of Hitch's old films, the more disappointed I am, with the exception of Psycho and Rear Window.",North by Northwest
14,rmax304823,Best in Show.,9,1 May 2009,"A lot of directors have taken a crack at the comedy-laced thriller, among them, most notably, Alfred Hitchcock, but probably none have topped this for sheer entertainment value.Cary Grant is a stereotypical Madison Avenue advertising man in the 1950s, shallow and given to ""expedient exaggerations."" He's urban, well groomed, and tan as only Cary Grant can be tan. By accident, he is misidentified as George Kaplan, a non-existent government agent. He's kidnapped by foreign operatives who try to kill him. When he manages to escape he's framed for a murder. With the police after him, he boards a train for Chicago in pursuit of the real ""Kaplan"", who of course is nothing more than a CIA-inspired fiction who occupies prop hotel rooms, wears prop clothes, and has prop dandruff. On the train he bumps into the savagely seductive Eva Marie Saint. This at least is no accident. She's a double agent, working for the suave spy, James Mason, and secretly for the CIA's Leo G. Carroll. The double pursuit -- the cops after Grant, Grant after ""Kaplan"" -- becomes twisted and winds up on the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.At the exciting climax, Cary Grant has shed some of his callousness and has committed his love and his life to Eva Marie Saint. His monogrammed matchbooks, ""R.O.T."", standing for Roger Thornhill and also for ""rot"" are no longer relevant.There are some splendid examples of black and white feature films. Who could improve on Gregg Toland's photography in ""Citizen Kane"" or the striking and sinuous contrasts in ""The Maltese Falcon"" or the bleak gaiety captured in ""La Dolce Vita""? But this one cries out for a big screen, color, and surround sound to accommodate composer Bernard Hermann's musical score, that opens and closes with a wild fandango.Okay. Visualize one of the sequences here, probably the best known. Kaplan has supposedly agreed to meet Grant at ""Prairie Stop, Indiana."" It's nothing more than a spot in the middle of a two-dimensionally flat wasteland -- no trees, no buildings, no hills, nothing but vast, tawny plowed plots and a parched cornfield nearby, all shimmering in the heat. Grant waits silently as the occasional car whizzes past. Nothing is happening. Then a man is dropped off across the highway. The two strangers are alone, staring at each other across the pavement. Minutes go by as they do nothing but stare, Grant puzzled (""Is this Kaplan?""), the other inexpressive. The other guy turns out to be a know-nothing local and after he departs on a bus, Grant is attacked by an airplane and barely escapes with his life. For the many people who have seen this sequence, let me ask them to imagine this shot in the traditional small screen ratio and done in black and white. It would lose half its impact.Some critics have, I think, over-interpreted the movie. I doubt that the title is taken from from Hamlet: ""I am but mad north-northwest: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw."" There's Grant's ambiguous relationship with his mother (a favorite Hitchcock theme in serious contexts), the wary love story, the development of Grant's character. But in this instance those features are trivialized. It's really a complicated, sublimely executed chase thriller at heart.Ernest Lehman's script includes many amusing incidents and some of them are very funny indeed. Not just snappy dialog -- ""Something wrong with your eyes, Mister?"" ""Yes, they're sensitive to questions."" But whole scenes that are laugh-out-loud comic -- Grant making a fool of himself at a public auction in order to attract the attention of the police. (The scene was prefigured in the much earlier ""All Through the Night"" and later imitated in ""The Prize."") The love affair between Grant and Saint begins with a dutiful seduction and ends with marriage -- too quickly, too jury-rigged, too required by the plot -- and some of the dialog between them is clumsy, but who cares? It's not art, but so little on the screen is. It's about as good an entertainment as you're likely to find, better than any of the chase thrillers coming out today. If I see another car chase that ends in an exploding fireball I'll write an angry OpEd piece for the New York Times.",North by Northwest
15,Tweekums,A classic thriller,10,12 February 2012,"This film might be over fifty years old but years old but it is still highly entertaining and demonstrates that a film can still be thrilling at a PG rating. The film opens with advertising executive Roger Thornhill being abducted when he is mistaken for a man called George Kaplan. He is taken to a large house where a man calling himself Lester Townsend questions him but as he isn't Kaplan he can't answer. Townsend assumes he is just trying to tough it out and arranges for Thornhill to have an 'accident'. He manages to escape though and after a run in with the police goes to see Townsend but discovers that the man he met the night before wasn't Townsend. The real Townsend is murdered and it looks like Thornhill did it. In an attempt to clear his name he tries to find the real Kaplan who is apparently in Chicago. On the train there he meets the beautiful Eve Kendall, who surprisingly helps him evade capture despite knowing what he is accused of... or it would be if she wasn't involved with the fake Townsend who we now know is called Vandamm. In the scenes that follow Thornhill must survive an attack by plane; discover exactly what is going on and finally confront his would-be killers on the face of Mount Rushmore! This film is rightly considered a classic and not just because of the iconic scenes involving the crop-duster and the finale on the faces of the presidents on Mount Rushmore; it is a classic because it is a good story that is well told. Every scene is part of the story with no distractions such as 'family moments' or endangered children. Cary Grant does a great job as the ordinary man who finds his life taking an extraordinary turn... even if his drunk scene did look like somebody playing drunk rather than actually being drunk! He was ably supported my James Mason who was suitable villainous without going over the top as bad guy Vandamm and Eve Marie Saint as Eve Kendall who may or may not be very dangerous to Thornhill. Hitchcock did a great job directing this; even a scene as simple somebody running from a building to a car looks amazing because he chose to film if from high up directly over the action. As well as some genuine thrills; there is a good mystery and even a nice little romance that might be subplot but is still essential to the main plot. If you have not seen this yet watch it the first chance you get; I doubt you will be disappointed.",North by Northwest
16,ma-cortes,Alfred Hitchcock top-notch thriller/comedy embroils a a business man in killing and espionage,8,27 January 2014,"Thrilling flick with funny moments , nice acting , spectacular outdoors and fun dialogue . The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses , as a hapless New York advertising executive , Roger Thornhill, (Gary Grant got $450,000 -a substantial amount for the time - plus a percentage of the gross profits ; though Yul Brynner and William Holden was suggested to play him) is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies (James Mason , Martin Landau) and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive . Grant is chased by both : the patrolmen who think he's a killer and a spy ring who think he is a double agent . He is helped by a gorgeous train passenger named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint , though the studio wanted Cyd Charisse or Sophia Loren for the female lead, and she wanted to do it, but contractual problems resulted in her having to turn it down for the part , but Hitchcock insisted upon Eva Marie Saint) .Enjoyable mystery movie involves a bewildered ad-man who hold numerous tricks in order to escape from his captors and being chased cross country . Entertaining suspense movie packs humor , intrigue and ordinary Hitch touches . This agreeable and often hilarious picture from master of suspense has a memorable scene after another and was the only film Alfred Hitchcock made for MGM .

Hitch was famous for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an interesting as well as fun screenplay by Ernest Lehman . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks such as Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco convent in ¨Vertigo¨ and the Statue of Liberty in ¨Sabotage¨ . Here includes Mount Rushmore images and now-legendary scenes such as crop-dusting plane sequences and the train station scene that was shot in New York City's Grand Central Terminal .Alfred Hitchcock couldn't get permission to film inside the UN, so footage was made of the interior of the building using a hidden camera, and the rooms were later recreated on a soundstage . Very good support cast such as James Mason , Martin Landau , Josephine Hutchinson , Les Tremayne as auctioneer and Jessie Royce Landis as mummy , though she was only 7 years older than Cary Grant, who plays her son . Features two actors who would go on to head spy agencies in their own 1960s television series. Edward Platt would star as ""Chief"" in ¨Get Smart¨, and Leo G. Carroll would star in ¨The man from U.N.C.L.E .

17,BA_Harrison,I really like the direction Hitchcock took with this film.,8,14 June 2018,"North by Northwest is a breezy espionage thriller, much lighter in tone than Hitchcock's later cold war spy movies, Topaz and Torn Curtain, and a whole lot more enjoyable as a result. Cary Grant plays Madison Avenue advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill, who is abducted by ruthless spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and his cohorts, who have mistaken him for an FBI agent named George Kaplan. Unable to convince the enemy of his real identity, Roger escapes and goes on the run to look for the real Kaplan, aided by a beautiful, mysterious blonde Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).The action moves along at a brisk pace, with charismatic lead Grant making for a likeable protagonist and Hitchcock delivering a couple of his most iconic scenes-the crop duster attack and the finalé on Mount Rushmore-both of which are excellent. It's not all perfection-the moment where Thornhill is framed for murder is laughable, the poor sap grabbing the knife buried in a man's back and then turning towards a news photographer who just happens to have his camera at the ready-but for a couple of hours of pure escapism, North by Northwest is a good way to go.",North by Northwest
18,moonspinner55,"""I never make love on an empty stomach...""",7,15 October 2007,"Smashing suspense-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock stars Cary Grant as an ordinary Madison Avenue businessman who is falsely accused of being a spy and a killer, jetting all over the States to solve the tangled mystery. Even when covered with crop-dust, Grant always appears dapper and dry-as-a-martini; both he and this classy adventure hold up extremely well, with Master of Suspense Hitchcock keenly using the patented ""wrong man"" plot just up to a point. With its amusingly inconsequential title, the screenplay is taut yet clever and droll, and the supporting cast (including James Mason as an icily controlled villain and Martin Landau as a faintly fey henchman) does some fabulous work. Even Eva Marie Saint seems to relax here (she's quite sexy and saucy; her best line--an early one aboard the train about making love on an empty stomach--got dubbed over, which hopefully will be corrected someday). Hitch keeps it all snappy and running smoothly, done with a wink and some sly innuendo. *** from ****",North by Northwest
19,Quinoa1984,"a big collection of classic Hitchcock sequences, strung together by red herrings, plus Cary Grant",10,24 February 2007,"Although I wouldn't rank North by Northwest in the highest pantheon of Hitchcock's masterpieces- it won't ever get as deep or revelatory or demanding of repeat viewings as Psycho or Vertigo or Rope- it's got enough crackling, dry-sharp wit and incorrigible suspense sequences for an excellent time. One can tell that Hitchcock might be reaching at times to get commercial appeal, even more than usual with his films of the 50s (and after Vertigo and before Psycho, he's trying to make up for what he thought of as lost ground at the box office frankly). But it's all the same a ballsy commercial entertainment that still hails high above the ranks of today's proficient but soulless demonstrations of panache with archetypal heroes and villains in double-cross moves. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising man who gets the typical-Hitchcock 'wrong-man' scenario, and as typical too involving a) spies, b) government espionage with the all-popular 'MacGuffin', and c) a blonde leading lady with her own issues to deal with in the middle of the men. The villains in this case are the very calm and collected James Mason and his leering henchman Martin Landau, as a quasi-chase develops across the country all over George Kaplan- who, by the way, doesn't really exist.The plot, to be sure, is cobbled together under Ernest Lehman's attempts to put together something that Hitchcock would respond to and, more crucially, afford him his two favorite pastimes: first is the witty, very knowing, practically self-conscious dialog meant exclusively to lighten potentially clichéd territory and give grins to others; the scenes with Grant and Saint in the train car, trading off innuendo, is one scene that over-steps the problematic territory, in general their chemistry is elevated thanks to Lehamn's snappy, amusing words. There's even a great bit provided by Thornhill's mother, played by Jessie Royce Landis, as one of Hitchcock's older who smirk things like ""You gentlemen aren't REALLY trying to kill my son, are you?"" The other pastime are absurd but completely wonderful sequences where a character or characters get pitted against larger-than-life odds. The hallmark crop-duster scene was the one I had seen even before the whole film, in a class where the sequence was broken down; this, along with Psycho's shower scene, make up some of the most accomplished executions of storyboarding, and how timing and details of the figures in a shot, and the intensity or lack thereof, that Hitchcock's ever done. The Mount Rushmore climax- save for what happens to Grant and Saint following the cliffhanger moment, which is my least favorite part of the movie- is also stellar, including what precedes it in the hideout.North by Northwest is essential viewing, but is it really a completely devastating triumph like Hitchcock at the peak of his powers? Not exactly, as there's some moments where it feels like Hitchcock on auto-pilot with some of the twists and preposterous turns, and he's really more into his suspense scenes and getting Grant perfect in these scenes more than anything else. There's also not much depth to the whole process, yet that's part of its appeal as a yarn of an adventure story. But as a suspense-comedy, it's a work of big-studio success, as Grant comes off on note in every scene he's in, and helps make even the smaller, supporting actors seem important in the grand scheme of the story. In a way it's a great Hitchcock film in the sense that you can just curb the usual logic at the door and just hop along for the ride, and it's in this that North by Northwest should always be remembered (alongside the Bernard Herrmann score, one of his best).",North by Northwest

21,wes-connors,Hitchcock Plays Tag,10,25 August 2009,"After ""Vertigo"", director Alfred Hitchcock turns up the comedy, and tones down the subtlety, for this one. ""North by Northwest"" is also the summation of a favorite, most-used Hitchcock plot: an ordinary man is mistakenly identified, falsely accused, and pursued by mysterious forces. The famous ""crop-dusting sequence"" is the peak of this story-theme, with wronged man Cary Grant (as Roger O Thornhill) helplessly attacked by an airplane in broad daylight as he waits at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere to meet a man who doesn't exist.The only logical way to follow-up this line of suspense was with ""The Birds""; therein, the attacker becomes the inhuman, thus more horrific, species of flying fowl. We innately know that, if birds were as big as crop-dusting airplanes, they would eat us. So, Mr. Grant is perhaps safer with a single plane than he would be against a flock of seagulls. The missing link in Hitchcock's chronological quartet is ""Psycho"", which followed ""North by Northwest"", and climaxes the director's psychologically-based terror themes. And, at long last, sex is used like a fly-swatter.The marvelously funny script, by Ernest Lehman, received most of the attention, when it was time to give out 1959 movie awards. Hitchcock's direction, Bernard Herrmann's musical score and George Tomasini's editing couldn't be beat - but, they were. A trio of supporting players might have be noticed: Eva Marie Saint (as Eve Kendall), Martin Landau (as Leonard), and James Mason (as Phillip Vandamm) seethe with forbidden sex. Listen up for Mr. Landau's scene-stealing ""Call it my woman's intuition"" line; and, watch for Ms. Saint to seductively mouth ""I never make love on an empty stomach.""

22,Coventry,Pure cinematic perfection It's as simple as that!,10,29 October 2014,"I always do something special for anniversaries, and since this is the 3.400th user comment that I write for this wonderful website, I chose to review one of the greatest movies of all-time! Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a timeless landmark, an impeccable classic and a pure cinematic monument! Only a handful of movies are totally perfect in every tiniest detail and remain just as astounding by today's standards as when they were first released upon audiences; - more than fifty years ago in this case. Straight from the marvelous and already unforgettable opening credits, designed by the brilliant Saul Bass and provided with mind-blowing music by Bernard Herrmann, you know that this will become a highlight even in the overall magnificent repertoire of Alfred Hitchcock. The genius screenplay, written by the same guy who scripted ""The Sound of Music"" and ""West Side Story"" of all people, is a kind of James Bond story avant-la-lettre. It's a nail-bitingly tense and at times extremely grotesque conspiracy/espionage thriller in which an innocent man's identity is mistaken for that of a government spy who actually doesn't exist. The sly and overconfident advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill is abducted from a hotel lobby and taken to a fancy countryside mansion where he's forced to admit that he is George Kaplan by the foreign spy Philippe Vandamm and his rude team. Thornhill narrowly escapes a carefully planned assassination attempt, but subsequently finds himself framed for murder and pursued by the police as well as by his assailants. He travels to Chicago by train, meets the staggeringly beautiful Eve Kendall and battles for his life all across America, until the final confrontation takes place on top of the Mount Rushmore monument. Now, it's already immensely difficult to bring a genuine edge-of- your-seat suspense thriller, but this film is simultaneously also comical! The humor in the screenplay of ""North by Northwest"" is constant, subtle and dry. The dialogs between Cary Grant and Eve Saint Marie are a terrific example of this, but also the performances of Martin Landau (as the main villain's evil sidekick) and Jessie Royce Landis (as Grant's skeptical mother) are blackly humorous. The action sequences are phenomenal, with the legendary crop dusting airplane chase sequence as the absolute highlight, and the climax is unforgettable. ""North by Northwest"" is just downright perfect; it's as simple as that.",North by Northwest
23,sunwarrior13,Laid The Groundwork For Countless Action Thrillers,10,27 February 2012,"North by Northwest is a thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason. The screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"".North by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization who want to stop his interference in their plans to smuggle out microfilm containing government secrets.Author and journalist Nick Clooney praised Lehman's original story and sophisticated dialogue, calling the film ""certainly Alfred Hitchcock's most stylish thriller, if not his best"".This is one of several Hitchcock movies with a music score by Bernard Herrmann and features a memorable opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. This film is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits.While having lunch at the Plaza Hotel in New York, advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill has the bad luck to call for a messenger just as a page goes out for a ""George Kaplan."" From that moment, Thornhill finds that he has stepped into a nightmare -- he is quietly abducted by a pair of armed men out of the hotel's famous Oak Room and transported to a Long Island estate; there, he is interrogated by a mysterious man who, believing that Roger is George Kaplan, demands to know what he knows about his business and how he has come to acquire this knowledge. Roger, who knows nothing about who any of these people are, can do nothing but deny that he is Kaplan or that he knows what they're talking about. Finally, his captors force a bottle of bourbon into Roger and put him behind the wheel of a car on a dangerous downhill stretch. Through sheer luck and the intervention of a police patrol car and its driver (John Beradino), Roger survives the ride and evades his captors, and is booked for drunk driving. He's unable to persuade the court, the county detectives, or even his own mother of the truth of his story, however -- Thornhill returns with them to the mansion where he was held, only to find any incriminating evidence cleaned up and to learn that the owner of the house is a diplomat, Lester Townsend, assigned to the United Nations. He backtracks to the hotel to find the room of the real George Kaplan, only to discover that no one at the hotel has ever actually seen the man. With his kidnappers once again pursuing him, Thornhill decides to confront Townsend at the United Nations, only to discover that he knows nothing of the events on Long Island, or his house being occupied -- but before he can learn more, Townsend gets a knife in his back in full view of 50 witnesses who believe that Roger did it. Now on the run from a murder charge, complete with a photograph of him holding the weapon plastered on the front page of every newspaper in the country, Thornhill tries to escape via train -- there he meets the coolly beautiful Eve Kendall, who twice hides him from the police, once spontaneously and a second time in a more calculated rendezvous in her compartment that gets the two of them together romantically, at least for the night. By the next day, he's off following a clue to a remote rural highway, where he is attacked by an armed crop-dusting plane, one of the most famous scenes in Hitchcock's entire film output. Thornhill barely survives, but he does manage to learn that his mysterious tormentor/interrogator is named Phillip Vandamm, and that he goes under the cover of being an art dealer and importer/exporter, and that Eve is in bed with him in every sense of the phrase -- or is she?This is a great film, and certainly one of the most entertaining movies ever made, directed by Alfred Hitchcock at his peak.It has all the classic elements of a Hitchcock film - well timed suspense, an overall mystery, a compelling cast and some brilliantly conceived scenes.Finally,it has stood the test of time as a gripping, suspenseful, and visually iconic, this late-period Hitchcock classic laid the groundwork for countless action thrillers to follow for many years to come.",North by Northwest

25,hitchcockthelegend,Sometimes the truth does taste like a mouthful of worms.,10,4 March 2008,"Roger O Thornhill is a harmless and amiable advertising executive who is absurdly mistaken for a government agent by a gang of ruthless spies. Forced to go out on the lam, Thornhill lurches from one perilous scenario to another. Can he survive to prove his innocence? Is the gorgeous blonde who is helping him really a friend? All will be revealed in Alfred Hitchcock's majestic thriller.If deconstructing it you find that this isn't a perfect Hitchcock movie, for it under uses James Mason's coolly vile Phillip Vandamm (which is a crime), and it also doesn't have a female lead acting with any great urgency since Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall fails to fully fulfil the promise of Kendall's arrival in the movie. Yet this film rightly earns the right to be on any critics top 100 list, to be a favourite amongst the legion of Hitchcock fans (of which I'm one of that number), for it is escapist entertainment in its purest form, Hitchcock's most accessible popcorn entertainment piece.From the moment at the film's opening when you hear Bernard Herrmann's wonderful music, it's enough to send goose pimples all over the body. For it is a musical portent that signifies we are about to get a fusion of thrills, mystery, and some cheeky Hitchcock humour, accompanied by heroes and villains all condensed purely for our enjoyment. Fronted by a diamond Cary Grant performance as the man wrongly mistaken for another that leads to him being pursued frighteningly across the states, the pic is never found wanting for genre high points. Coming as it did after the darkly brilliant and soul sapping Vertigo, Hitchcock clearly wanted to hang loose and enjoy himself.Working from a fabulous script by Ernest Lehman, North By Northwest's very reason for being is purely to entertain those wanting to invest a frame of mind with it, with Hitchcock cunningly putting us on side with what is ultimately a shallow character in Grant's Roger O (the O doesn't stand for anything) Thornhill. It's a neat trick from the master of trickery and devilment. Some of the scenes on show are now almost folk lore such is the esteem in which they are held by movie fans and makers alike. A crop dusting aeroplane attack (the prelude to which has those goose pimples popping up in anticipation), a pursuit on Mount Rushmore and the often forgotten drunk car on a cliff sequence, these are all trade mark pieces of work from Hitchcock.North By Northwest is in my humble opinion one of the true greats of cinema history, where as bleak and as unnervingly brilliant as Vertigo was the previous year, this is the polar opposite in structure and fable, but the result is most definitely equally as great. One of the reasons I fell in love with cinema in fact. 10/10",North by Northwest
26,jotix100,Strangers on a train,10,30 October 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is one of the best films in his long and distinguished career. Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture. James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent.""North by Northwest"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best crafted films thanks to the brilliant people that came together to work in it.",North by Northwest
27,Hey_Sweden,"""I don't like the way Teddy Roosevelt's looking at me.""",9,14 July 2020,"Top entertainment from the Master of Suspense, ""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchs' finest thrillers. Cary Grant, in his final collaboration with Hitch, is aces as a Madison Avenue adman who, by sheer chance, is mistaken as a spy by nefarious types including a debonair James Mason and a creepy Martin Landau. He's also framed for murder, and therefore pursued by the cops, while trying to locate the elusive ""George Kaplan"" who can supposedly help extricate him from the mess. Grant also finds the time to fall in love with a classic elegant blonde Hitchcock leading lady in the form of Eva Marie Saint.Hitch was truly firing on all cylinders here. Assisted by another great score by Bernard Herrmann, his picture begins with typically stylish Saul Bass opening credits. The enticing script is by Ernest Lehman, and for once, it's the kind of scenario where things add up by the time the story finishes. Hitch wastes no time getting the story underway, with a standard little cameo by himself after the opening credits have concluded.Even at two hours and 17 minutes, ""North by Northwest"" never feels as long as it is, due to masterful filmmaking and that twist-laden story. It has the appeal of a scenario wherein an ordinary type of guy ends up way over his head in intrigue. Grant is often scrambling for his life, whether he's pursued by a plane ""crop dusting"", or hanging on by his fingernails from the faces of Mount Rushmore (two very iconic sequences).The cast is wonderful all the way down the line: Mason, Landau, Jessie Royce Landis (playing Grants' mother, despite being just a few years older than him), Leo G. Carroll, Adam Williams, Robert Ellenstein, Edward Platt, Edward Binns, etc. That great English character actor Carroll is a delight as the savvy ""Professor"" who will ultimately have to give Grant some pretty potent exposition. Grant is lots of fun, and Lehman gives him some pretty funny dialogue to savour. Grant also has fine chemistry with Saint, who does come off as aloof at first, but whose stiff-lipped exterior slowly eases.""North by Northwest"" is a tremendous diversion that continues to hold up well, 61 years later. It caps off the great run that Hitch had during the 1950s, with The Master choosing to follow it with one of his most enduring experiments, the legendary ""Psycho"".Nine out of 10.",North by Northwest

They soon realize they've captured the wrong man and try to have him killed. But it doesn't work and Thornhill finds himself a hunted man...OK--this is not perfect. There's some lousy back projection (but all Hitchcock films have that) and I was never really sure WHAT the bad guys were doing (something to do with microfilm). Also I've never believed Grant's actions when someone is killed in front of him (WHY did he grab the knife?). But the film is so incredibly entertaining no one has ever cared. This has some of Hitchcock's most famous scenes--the infamous ""crop dusting"" sequence and the climax on top of Mount Rushmore--but the whole film is just as good. There's a tense auction sequence and Grant's harrowing car ride down a treacherous road while dead drunk.There are some amusing parts in the film: Grant's mother appears to be a few years YOUNGER than him; the main villains last name is Vandamm; the romantic sparring between Grant and Eva Marie Saint is full of sexual innuendo; Martin Landau (one of Vandamm's henchman) is gay (he says he has a woman's intuition and has slightly exaggerated mannerisms--but it's not offensively done) and get a load of Vandamms mountain house at the end! Grant appears a bit old for this but he pulls it off; Eva Marie Saint is incredibly beautiful and pretty good as the love interest (sort of); Martin Landau is so young and handsome with blazing blue eyes and James Mason is just perfect as the evil Vandamm--his lines seem to come so effortlessly and he's so suave...but you also see the cruelty hiding underneath. Probably one of the best Hitchcock villains ever.So--excellent script with incredible dialogue; rich, bright Technicolor; shot in VistaVision (a wide screen process); great score and Hitchcock's always great direction with several astounding camera shots. Never boring--even at 136 minutes. A true classic. Don't miss this one! I give it a 10.""That's funny. That plane is dusting crops where there ain't no crops.""",North by Northwest
29,LeonLouisRicci,Excellent But Not Great,7,22 September 2012,"One of the things that the Director is accused of is his phony, stagy looking sets. One could also call them surreal and that is a complement. It puts the viewer in an uneasy setting that looks otherworldly and charming. This films has its share of this ethereal look.This is a highly rated film that is possibly a bit too highly rated. It seems long and has a number of scenes that are clunky and unnecessary. All the Mother stuff is corny and contributes nothing to the story and goes absolutely nowhere and is frankly frumpy when meant to be funny.Talk about slick. This film is so slick that it truly represents the plastic 1950's. A cosmetic sheen of soullessness that can be seen as a cookie cutter culture and a superficial society. One needs only look at this film and it is apparent that movie makers and money men ate this stuffy stuff up. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint look like mannequins and the banter of sexy double entendres seem more scripted than sincere playfulness.The supporting cast of bad guys are interesting if not completely threatening. They too are stiff and except for Martin Landau's openly gay portrayal (""call it my woman's intuition"") speak and act like an artificial species.The movie has many masterful touches... the glossy and interesting cinematography...the great Bernard Herrmann score...the groundbreaking crop duster scene...and the alluring broad scope of the production.

Its not that it's a bad movie, rather I think that the film has been ripped off and re-staged so many times that any power the film might have had is rather dissipated. Its kind of like watching Citizen Kane or some other film that is said to have changed the way movies are done and finding that they don't play all that well. The reason is, like North by Northwest that they changed the rules and have been so copied it hard to see what was so revolutionary about them. As it stands now the story of Cary Grant being mistaken for someone else and having to flee from both the police and the bad guys is exciting, especially in its set pieces, but the rest of it isn't anything special and has the feel of been there and done that especially when compared with Hitchcock's other films.

Given that pairing you could practically cast Marjorie Main as the love interest and get away with it. For an average man in the street Grant is urbanity personified in the face of real, life-threatening danger and witty with it. It defies credence that someone who'd just been force fed an entire fifth of Bourbon would be able to sit up straight in a car let alone negotiate a winding road in the face of oncoming traffic and if you swallow this then nothing that follows will faze you.

36,ferguson-6,Dustin' Crops where there ain't no Crops,9,19 July 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. It seems apropos that Hollywood's first stylish thriller with tongue planted firmly in cheek should come from director Alfred Hitchcock. We get two of the most iconic scenes in one film: Cary Grant being targeted by a crop duster, and the chase across the faces of Mt Rushmore. That combined with the stellar writing of famed screenwriter Ernest Lehman (West Side Story, The Sound of Music) provide one the all-time most entertaining and beloved thrillers.Cary Grant plays Roger O Thornhill (the O stands for nothing), a Madison Avenue Advertising hotshot who gets mixed up in a wild case of mistaken identity that involves the CIA and an unnamed foreign intelligence agency. Spies who nab the wrong guy ... there's something funny about that, as long as you aren't ""the guy"". The story is tied into the Cold War, but really the fun part of the film involves watching Thornhill maneuver his way through the maze with very little assistance. Well Eve Kendall (played by Eva Marie Saint) says she is helping, but it doesn't take long to figure out that she's no innocent bystander ... what blonde ever is innocent in a Hitchcock film? The bad guy is Vandamm, played with true menace by James Mason (whose wonderfully creepy voice always made him a terrific villain). His henchman is a young Martin Landau, whose mannerisms will have you raising an eyebrow throughout. While many rave about the scenes with Grant and Ms. Saint, my favorites involve Grant and Mason. Two suave masters going at each other with verbal sparring that stands up more than 50 years later.This was Hitchcock's only film for MGM, and I would argue it is his most visually stylish ... clothing, set decorations and the beautiful scenery and camera work. Of course, one can't help notice the poor gray suit that Grant wears through most of the film. It looks fabulous on him, even after he crawls out of the corn fields. Mr. Grant may be the most elegant actor to ever grace the silver screen. He moves like a dancer and has the face of model. This is a true movie star. I have often stated that he mastered the confounded grimace and the quick, sly smile and he built a career.Bernard Herrmann delivered yet another perfect score and Lehman's risqué' (for the times) dialogue is especially fun in the train's dining car. Finally getting to see this one on the big screen gave me a whole new appreciation for the crop dusting scene and Mt Rushmore. The scale of both segments is pure Hitchcock art. On a final note, there are so many character actors whom you will recognize throughout the film. Many went on to long careers in the 60's and 70's and even beyond. A true classic from the master.",North by Northwest

Cary Grant plays an advertising executive abducted and learns that he was mistaken for someone else. He cannot reason with them and when he refuses to cooperate with their demands he is force fed alcohol and sent on a driving spree that ends with his arrest. His story is laughed at and a trip to the mansion with police goes unsuccessful due to the removal of evidence. Fascinating mystery with Grant up for murder with plot turns, train rides, mystery blondes, and a heart-pounding climax atop Mount Rushmore. Skilled directing by Alfred Hitchcock who worked with Grant in three previous films. Grant is hilarious yet intelligent as he struggles to render his innocence as well as avoid police. Eva Marie Saint plays a suspicious blonde with secret ties beneath the romance. James Mason plays the sly villain whose defeat should have been more highlighted. Jesse Royce Landis brings humour as Grant's unbelieving mother but more of her would have been great. Martin Landau plays Mason's sinister head henchmen.

39,HotToastyRag,"""Games . . . must we?""",7,2 July 2018,"There are so many iconic elements to North by Northwest, from Bernard Herrmann's complicated score, to the chase scene between Cary Grant and an airplane, to Eva Marie Saint's come-on, ""I don't particularly like the book I'm reading,"" to the location of the end action scene. While everyone has their favorite parts to the movie, mine are not the most famous. My favorite scene is when Cary Grant drunkenly phones his mother from the police station. It's easily the funniest scene in the film, and I happen to adore Cary when he's in his humorous element. My favorite line in the film has become a frequently used household phrase of my family's: James Mason, in one of his iconic villainous roles, smirks at Cary and asks, ""Games . . . must we?"" in his imitable accent. It's hilarious, and we frequently say, ""James . . . must we?"" instead when we joke about him or his movies.I don't really like North by Northwest, even though I've seen it over a dozen times. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films, and everyone in my family really likes it, so it was one of the classics I was raised on as a kid. In general, I find Hitchcock's movies to be a little slow, and I don't think Eva Marie Saint is as appealing as her role necessitates. If it weren't for Cary and James, I'd probably never watch this movie, but their energies together are great fun to watch. They were friends in real life, and when they verbally spar, it almost feels like they're playing a-dare I say it?-game.The plot is always a very intriguing one: an innocent misunderstanding leads certain people to believe Cary Grant has a different name, and he becomes implicated in a very dangerous situation. Since Cary's entirely innocent, it's easy to root for him, but since James is so charming and funny, it's incredibly easy to root for him, too. Aren't the best stories the ones where you're torn between rooting for the bad and good guys? If you think so, you'll probably really like North by Northwest. If you don't end up liking it, then you can ask the screen, ""James . . . must we?""",North by Northwest
40,AaronCapenBanner,Cross-Country Adventure.,8,13 October 2013,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this highly entertaining adventure film that stars Cary Grant as advertising executive Roger Thornhill, who, while in a New York hotel, is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan by a foreign spy ring led by Philip Vandamm(played by James Mason) who refuses to believe Roger when he insists it is a case of mistaken identity, after having him kidnapped. Roger manages to escape a deathtrap, but is thought to be a reckless drunk driver, and so goes on the run to prove his innocence, and fight the spies. On a train, he meets Eve Kendall(played by Eva Marie Saint) who helps him, but may not be all she seems either. Roger must dodge repeated assassination attempts, as he eventually makes it to their hideout atop Mount Rushmore. Leo G.

It obviously influenced the James Bond flicks of the 60s, which started three years later with ""Dr. No"" (1962), but it's very toned down by comparison because the hero in this case is not a trained spy. It's entertaining to a point, but also seriously overrated due to some glaring problems...Jessie Royce Landis plays the protagonist's mother when she was only a little over 7 years older than Cooper and it's too obvious; the story drags too much at this point (when he's hanging out with his mother); his chance meeting with a key character on the train (Saint) is too coincidental; their make-out sessions are premature, unconvincing and painfully dull; what happens to the plane is stupefying; the crop dusting encounter supposedly takes place in rural Indiana when it's clear that it's nowhere within a thousand miles of Indiana (actually it was shot at the southern end of Central Valley, California, outside of Bakersfield); speaking of which, the geography is too noticeably disingenuous: e.g. during the drunk driving episode there are no cliffs like that on Long Island (it was actually shot at Potrero Valley, Thousand Oaks, CA, and obviously so).Still, there's enough good here to enjoy if you favor Hitchcock & the cast and don't mind quaint movies.The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes (unnecessarily overlong).GRADE: B-/C+",North by Northwest
42,The_Void,Entertaining thrill-ride from start to finish,10,13 November 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of films, many of which are very good; and a select group of which are out and out masterpieces. His 1959 spy thriller, North by Northwest is undoubtedly among the man's best work; yet it stands out as something of a black sheep among the great director's other works. While the likes of Vertigo and Rear Window pull the viewer into the story by way of an intriguing and mysterious plot line; North by Northwest goes completely the other way, and draws you in with simple, old-fashioned entertainment value. It's true that there isn't much substance here, but at the same time; you can't doubt North by Northwest's credibility for a second, as Hitchcock has laid on the style and his story telling is as sharp as ever. The plot is typically Hitchcockian and sees a man kidnapped by a group of gangsters; on the mistake the he is someone else. After narrowly escaping, our hero goes on the run; from both the gangsters and the law. As he is drawn deeper and deeper into unfolding events, he finds himself more and more unable to stop them unfolding.By today's standards, North by Northwest could be seen as clichéd. Hitchcock has thrown in all the common spy thriller elements; from femme fatales and a British villain, to car chases and even an overblown finale; but Hitchcock implements all these elements in such a way that the film never feels old hat and, even now, nearly five decades on; North by Northwest is still an entertaining thriller, and that is testament to Hitchcock's endearing talent, as many of the recent films that are entertaining now, probably wont be fifty years down the line. Every set piece in the movie is beautifully engineered, and as the plot is perfectly paced; nothing ever seems like it shouldn't be there, and North by Northwest flows excellently. The film is best remembered for stand-out sequences including the famous bi-plane scene, but even those scenes, that have been seen separate from the movie many times, don't feel like they've been tacked on when viewing the movie in it's entirety. Many movies these days have instances that are there merely to be in the trailer and such; but here, Hitchcock is as restrained as ever, yet he still manages to insert scenes like this into the film.To be honest, I think Cary Grant got the short end of the stick with Hitchcock's films. While James Stewart got Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much and Rear Window, Grant only got gifted with Suspicion, To Catch a Thief, Notorious and this film; and while this one is very good, the rest of the Grant-Hitchcock collaborations are not among either man's best work. However, fans of both of these cinema legends can be thankful for North by Northwest, as both are on top of their game and in that instance; only a fine film can ensue. This isn't Cary Grant's best performance; sometimes he looks a bit out of place, and he's definitely spent too long on the sun beds - but his charm and charisma lifts even his most disappointing performances, and the one here certainly isn't one of those. Hitchcock's direction is flawless, and the film never feels clumsy or gets boring at any stage. If I was going to nit-pick, I would perhaps say that the film could have been streamlined a little bit more; but overall, North by Northwest is an entertaining classic that all fans of cinema need to see!",North by Northwest
43,Mr-Fusion,About as classic as they come.,9,20 February 2014,"One thing about Cary Grant's character in ""North by Northwest"": he's amazingly good-natured about the whole kidnap/murder thing. He's also surprisingly hangover-free after all that booze they pumped into him. Can't say I'd be so happy-go-lucky. But these are tiny nits to pick in an otherwise top-notch thriller, full of intrigue, paranoia and a bit of whimsy. It's remarkable how suspense just builds and builds in this movie (Hitchcock really was boss). And both the crop-duster and Mt. Rushmore scenes are iconic for a reason (their scramble on the face of the mountain is a real nail-biter).This movie's got it all: some great action, sharp dialogue between Grant and Saint, and some striking use of locations (the U.N. lobby and James Mason's cantilevered house, especially). Of what I've seen from Hitchcock, it's probably his most entertaining.9/10",North by Northwest

So I got the film and watched it. It was both exhilarating and completely goofy. I mean, it's 1959 , the clichés are different and many of the ones to come will be based on the ones in the movie.Cary Grant can't help but get the girl, his suit is almost spotless no matter what he does in it and how many days he is running by both police and bad guys in it and both FBI and baddies are pretty much ridiculous. Why did they abduct him in the first place? Why fake the death by drunk driving if they already knew he was a government agent? Why does the girl so blatantly, even by today's standards, hit on Cary Grant and he just doesn't get it's a ruse? How can one expect to successfully murder someone from a crop dusting plane using a machine-gun? Why all old guys in movies at that time come from education establishments?But at that time, it must have been great. I can imagine a remake with Ben Affleck and Scarlett Johansson. Vincent D'Onofrio as Vandamm, Martin Landau as The Professor, for continuity's sake :) Bottom line: is it the marvelously witty masterpiece of cinematography that I kind of expecting? Definitely not.

46,JamesHitchcock,One of My Favourite Hitchcock Films,9,9 January 2005,"""North by Northwest"" gets off to a mysterious start. Roger Thornhill, a New York advertising executive, is kidnapped and taken to a luxurious home in the countryside. He is interrogated by a group of men who believe that his real name is George Kaplan, and refuse to believe him when he says that he has never heard of Kaplan. The kidnappers attempt to kill Thornhill in a staged car accident, but he manages to escape. He discovers that the real owner of the house is Lester Townsend, a diplomat accredited to the United Nations, and goes to the UN building to speak to him, hoping that this will solve the mystery. Thornhill discovers that Townsend is not the man whom he met in the house, but almost immediately Townsend falls dead with a knife in his back.Hitchcock liked to tease his audience, and this film is a good example. At this stage we are as much in the dark as Thornhill. We do not know why he has been kidnapped, who Kaplan is, why the kidnappers want him dead or why Townsend was killed. These things gradually become clearer as the film progresses. We learn that the man behind the kidnapping is named Philip Vandamm and that he is the head of a spy ring betraying America's national secrets to the Russians. Thornhill is forced to go on the run, both from Vandamm and his associates who wrongly believe him to be a CIA agent and from the police who wrongly believe him to be Townsend's killer. He manages to escape with the assistance of a mysterious blonde named Eve Kendall, who may be in league with either Vandamm or the police.It is interesting that James Stewart was considered for the role of Thornhill but rejected in favour of Cary Grant because he ""looked too old"". Grant was several years older than Stewart, but was perfectly cast because this is an older man's film. Thornhill is (like a number of Hitchcock's heroes) an Everyman figure, a man who has hitherto led a prosperous but uneventful life in a routine job. He has no middle name, but has taken to calling himself Roger O. Thornhill. He is well aware of, and makes a joke of, the fact that this set of initials spells ""rot"", but is perhaps unaware of the symbolism of placing a meaningless zero at the centre of his name, with an implication that there is also a meaningless zero at the centre of his life. He has twice been married, but both marriages ended in divorce because his wives found his life too dull. Now, in middle age, he finds himself confronted with the possibility of adventure and of romance with Eve, with whom he has fallen in love.Eve is rather older than the normal Hitchcock heroine. Eva Marie Saint was thirty-five years old when she made the film, a decade older than, say, Kim Novak had been at the time of making ""Vertigo"", Hitchcock's previous film. Although Ms Saint's looks could have been those of a woman ten years younger, her voice and mannerisms were more suggestive of a sophisticated older woman than of a young girl. (She gave what must have been one of the most seductive performances ever given in a film with no overtly erotic content). Eve was originally Vandamm's mistress but, on learning of his illegal activities, agreed to help bring him to justice because, as she puts it, it was the first time she had been asked to do something worthwhile. For both Thornhill and Eve, the entanglement represents a chance to make a fresh start in life.Another excellent performance comes from James Mason as Vandamm, an outwardly suave, debonair English gentleman. This characterisation may owe something to a notorious case some years earlier when Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean, two young Britons from privileged establishment backgrounds, defected to Moscow after being exposed as part of a Communist spy ring. This impression is strengthened by the implication contained in the film that Leonard, Vandamm's henchman, is homosexual, as were both Burgess and MacLean.The film's most famous scene is the scene where Thornhill is menaced by the crop-dusting plane. Hitchcock may have included this sequence as a deliberate challenge to his ingenuity. The normal convention in thrillers is that suspenseful scenes exploit one or the other of two common phobias, claustrophobia or vertigo, and take place either in an enclosed space or high up where there is a danger of falling. (Hence the expression ""cliff-hanger"" for any tense situation; the film also contains a good example of a cliff-hanger in the literal sense, the final scene on Mount Rushmore). The crop-duster scene, however, is set in flat open country, but still generates great tension as Thornhill races for the cornfield, which provides the only cover in an otherwise featureless landscape.The film contains a number of elements which had become familiar features of Hitchcock's work- the man wrongly accused of a crime, espionage, a train journey, a glamorous blonde heroine, a chase sequence, an element of comic relief (especially the auction scene) and a cliff-hanging finale at a famous landmark. Despite this familiarity, however, the film never declines (as do some of his lesser works) into mere film-making by numbers; Hitchcock was able to use a tested formula to produce something fresh and exciting. Evidence of the film's success is provided by the fact that a number of other directors pay homage to it in their works; the nudist colony scene in Mark Robson's ""The Prize"" is a direct reference to the auction scene, and Stanley Donen's ""Charade"" borrows the device of the villain using another man's identity. (In that film too the victim is a diplomat). Apart from its immediate successor, ""Psycho"", ""North by Northwest"" remains my favourite Hitchcock work. 9/10",North by Northwest
47,Smells_Like_Cheese,They don't make 'em like this anymore!,9,26 September 2005,"I really enjoyed ""North by Northwest"", it had action, romance, and drama. I mean, seriously, as you have noticed in 2005, Hollywood has come out with a string of remakes. Because all of the awesome ideas have been taken pretty much, and when I saw this film, it put me back into the appreciation of the real good movies of the past. Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt one of the greatest directors of the 20th century. I hope his work will never die within the years because of all these remakes, I'm afraid that when I have a family one day and if my kids have a love for films as I do, they won't get to witness how great movies were made. The acting, yes, it's clique, but it works so well. It has a ""Casablanca"" type of feel for the romance. The action had some wit and humor to it.

48,DKosty123,Cropdusting 101 & Intrigue With Mistaken Identity,10,6 September 2006,"This film is the most famous of all of Alfred Hitchcocks work & is the one that more people remember Cary Grant for now. When Alfred made this film, he had learned everything about playing the audience through a vast experience in films, plus his TV show. It shows in this one. It is wonderfully paced, imaginative, provocative, & suspenseful all at the same time. The imagination used to design this film, from using the UN Building for a murder scene to Mount Rushmore for scenery and suspense, to the barest flat farmland in the Mid-west, & then making a surprise happen at every location is just amazing. Hitchcock did a fun trailer for this movie that plays like a travel agent promo.The plot is Grant (Thornhill) being mistaken for an imaginary spy fits perfect & the cast is perfect. James Mason is an excellent actor and performs very well as the heavy in this film. Eva Marie Saint is a hot double agent being asked to sacrifice all for her country. She lends an air of class to the proceedings. Martin Landau is fine supporting the bad guys. Leo G Carroll is excellent in support as a top US intelligence man known as the Professor who seems to be pulling all the strings.I am not sure how this thriller could be any better & I pray no one will ever try to remake this one.

49,ksf-2,one of Hitchcock's experiments in timing,9,1 June 2004,"Just as Hitchcock used the elements of suspense and timing in Psycho, they are at work here again in North by Northwest. Grant, the lead character, is in the middle of some giant spy thriller adventure, running all over the country ( scope the different venues - the UN building, an auction house, farm fields, trains, and the thrilling climax at an American landmark...) In Psycho, what the audience thinks is the lead character is killed off early in the movie... here in N by NW, it's a different kind of timing experiment - the hero of the movie (and the viewer!) are kept in the dark, caught up in the intrigue until three quarters of the way through the movie. When Cary Grant (and the viewer) are filled in on what is really going on, it's an easy transition to complete the rest of the movie, and the plot sort of changes over to a ""will the good guys beat the bad guys ?"" plot, and the viewer has to be able to buy into some of the things that happen...

50,lasttimeisaw,the most entertaining and mainstream Hitchcock,8,1 November 2014,"An originator of the wronged-man-goes-berserk thriller, Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the ultimate heavyweight which can make its contemporaneous 007 vehicle, say GOLDFINGER (1964, 6/10), embarrassingly pale in comparison. Two of its most visually memorable and elaborately appreciated action sequences of this delectable classic are the murderous crop-dusting biplane and the final cliffhanger on the Mt. Rushmore, still full of vim and vigor upon my first viewing. But it is also a great suspenseful mystery (at least for at the first half) of a mistaken identity, the McGuffin is an agent called George Kaplan, and our innocent protagonist, an advertising man Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for him due to a rather trivial coincidence (which completely evaded me during my viewing) in the beginning. Subsequently Thornhill is framed as a murderer wanted in every newspaper, and hunted by a foreign spy Vandamm (Mason) and his underlings, after several laborious but failed plotting to murder him, including the ill-fated deploy of a femme fatale Eve Kendall (Marie Saint) to seduce him on the overnight 2oth Century Limited, where the romance is budding profusely and the suspicion is naturally engendered. Meanwhile audience get to know the true identity of this secretive Mr. Kaplan, who is merely a decoy concocted by secret services lead by the Professor (Carroll). Yet in their plan, Thornhill is regarded only as an unfortunate canon fodder, who they have no intention to rescue in the first place. Until Thornhill outwits Vandamm's lame scheme and confronts him and Eve in an auction house, only at that moment, the Professor decides to give a helping hand (only because one of his double agent is in danger of being exposed). And for the same season, after knowing the entire story, Thornhill decides to keep playing Mr. Kaplan until the endgame, to seize Vandamm and his cohorts. Initially Cary Grant is maximizing his nonchalant debonair as his usual gambit, as a mommy's boy, his scenes with his mother Clara (a pitch-perfect Royce Landis, albeit who was only 7 years senior than him, thanks to the excruciatingly uninviting ageism in the showbiz) is a hoot to enjoy, and then when peril is piling up, he becomes more alert and agitated in his desperate move to track down who is George Kaplan, although it is hard not to roll one's eyes to the utter hokum that he can swiftly shuttle among the public place without being faintly recognized as a wanted man. Thankfully the two-hander between him and a graceful and deadly charming Eva Marie Saint shots the bull's eye, the age-difference is glaring, but it grabs the attention with Hitchcock's infamous blonde-fixation, Eva comes off lively in her elusive ambivalence, she is irresistible and enigmatic, not until the prompt plot twist, which degrades her into a female prey waiting to be rescued. Mason and Landau make a solid evil pair, the former is urbanely callous while the latter is dourly menacing, but as almost all the villain in the films, their luck is leaking when the film starts, with bad choices of dispatching our hero, and unspecified missteps in the process. I cannot claim this is my favourite Hitchcock's film, PSYCHO (1960, 9/10) is still my current pick, but it is the most entertaining and mainstream fare in his oeuvre, Hitchcock is a master of intrigues, and the film is an enthralling roller-coaster ride in 136 minutes with fun and delight galore.",North by Northwest

52,OllieSuave-007,One great mystery caper from Hitchcock!,9,30 June 2015,"North by Northwest is another one of Alfred Hitchcock's greats, a story where advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a government agent by foreign spies. Therefore, he gets pursued across the country and tries to evade the spies, as well as the police who thinks Thornhill has committed murder.Hitchcock keeps the suspense going throughout the film, filling you with intrigue and making you eager to know how Thornhill will get out of his debacle as we see him face one misadventure after the other. Hitchcock brilliantly combines drama and thrills in the movie with no boring fillers that captivates the audience from start to finish. There is also humor in abundance, most notable being Cary Grant's quick comebacks and wit, which puts in added charm and laughter to this thriller. And, speaking of charm, his on-screen chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is spot-on and touching, especially since she is a mystery woman throughout much of the film and her purpose is ambiguous.Robert Burks did a great job on the cinematography, especially in achieving the brilliance in the refreshing aura, atmosphere and detailed scale of the Mt.

53,sddavis63,Engaging From Start To Finish,7,13 January 2014,"I want to say first that I liked this movie. I also have to say that I expected a little bit more from a movie that's considered one of the best ever made, and one of the best (if not THE best by many people) movies ever directed by Alfred Hitchcock. I found it to be an engaging movie, most certainly. It never lost my attention. There was enough going on that I wanted to know how things were going to turn out, and there were even a few situations in which it was impossible to know who's side a particular character was on. All that worked very well for me.I was also impressed by the performances from the three primary leads. Cary Grant was quite good as Roger Thornhill, a New York City businessman who through a case of mistaken identity ends up on the run as apparently Eastern bloc agents try to pull off some sort of scheme (that isn't really revealed until close to the end of the movie.) Thornhill is maybe a little too good at times - your normal businessman who seems to take too readily to the undercover espionage business. But Grant did well as the character. James Mason was the villain Philip Vandamm and was able to offer the perfect combination of menace and charm - just enough to make his character (who could have been quite one dimensional) interesting. And, of course, there had to be a beautiful woman - in this case Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall, who becomes involved with Thornhill but is actually working for Vandamm.I'm not sure that I'd agree that this was Hitchcock's finest performance as a director. He made a movie that was engaging, but not really spellbinding, although he managed to do a good job of gradually building the suspense.Certainly,. this is a very good movie. I'd argue, though, that it's a wee bit over-rated. Still very good, though. (7/10)",North by Northwest

Sure, I've seen very few of his films and I'm really partial to Psycho and The Birds, but North By Northwest is no short of a classic.Granted, this movie may seem dated now, 50 years later, and furthermore, I doubt, if remade, like Psycho, any of the events of this movie couldn't even be remotely possible today, given its time and shape of cinema in the late 1950s, this was a perfect movie. It had absolutely everything: adventure, mistaken identity, comedy, romance, spy and the everyman charm of one of the greatest actors of all time, Grant. He was absolutely perfect in his role, an instant charisma that made you believe in, root for and be like at all times. No one could do it better.As for Eva Marie Saint, she was wonderful too. It's funny. I'm a huge Superman fan (since age 3) and during this updated viewing of the classic, I kept trying to picture her nearly 50 years older in Superman Returns as Martha Kent. I couldn't do itthey just didn't look like. Despite that, she was great in her seductive role.Grant plays Roger O.

See, he's a self-proclaimed liar (advertising) and now that the shoe's on the other foot, he must adjust.Not before long, he's accused of drunk-driving (which, as I pointed out before, most of these scenes wouldn't work today; here, the DUI's all but comical), murder, eluding the police, etc, etc. He's trying to solve the mystery, survive and romance a stranger (oooorrrr, is she???) on a train, Saint.As in most Hitchcock classics, I'm always drawn to the intrigue, suspense, originality and acting, but I think overall – the dialogue. Here it's pristine. Sure, Grant is responsible for 90% of it, but Saint also delivers some zingers. And to this day, again, 50 years later, is still fresh, funny and moves the story in a perfect rhythm. I can't even think of many movies today that develop such a punch for such witty and sharp dialogue.I think all should see this: young, old, people that first saw this in theatres, or to those who need to put the Wii down for a few hours. It's a fun, extremely family-friendly film that has tremendous depth, layers, adventure and allows the audience to pretend (or I would as a kid) to be someone else, this Thornhill/Kaplan character.",North by Northwest
55,bensonmum2,"""How does a girl like you get to be a girl like you?""",10,2 December 2015,"I'd like to kick myself in the seat of the pants for just now getting around to watching North By Northwest. I've been meaning to sit down with it for years and finally got around to it this week. It's a case of too many movies and too little time. Anyway, what a treat! It's Alfred Hitchcock and Carey Grant doing what they do best and treating us to one of the most entertaining pieces of film I've ever seen. I don't throw 10/10 ratings around like candy. Over the years, I've taken the time to rate 2,575 entries on IMDb. Of those, I've only given 52 (well, now 53) 10/10 ratings. To me, a movie has to be really special to deserve a 10. And North By Northwest is a very special movie.I've read more than a few of the North By Northwest reviews on IMDb and many cover the positive aspects of the movie much better and more intelligently than I ever could. Instead of trying to write a real review, I'm just gong to make a few comments on the film:1. I've read a few reviews that complain about the unrealistic aspects and situations in the movie. I hope no one thinks that Hitchcock was ever going for a realistic look at crime. In an interview I read, he calls the movie, ""A fantasy of the absurd"". I'd call it a PERFECT fantasy of the absurd. The movie flawlessly mixes action, suspense, and comedy to create a wonderfully entertaining experience. And as I've said any number of times, I watch movies to be entertained. 2. Apparently, Hitchcock selected Grant in the lead over James Stewart. No offense meant to Stewart, but I cannot imagine anyone in the Thornhill role other than Grant. His comedic touch, mixed with his good looks, his acting ability, and his ability to play a put-upon wrong man type role make him ideal. He may not have been the ""everyman"" Stewart was, but there's still something in his character that makes him eminently relatable. 3. Like any movie fan, I was aware of the crop duster scene. It's an iconic movie moment that has transcended the movie. And it's just as good as I could have hoped. But I wasn't aware of the auction scene. That has to be one of the best moments I've experienced in a movie. It's just so perfect. 4. As much as I enjoyed North By Northwest, there are a few moments that, if they could be changed, the movie would have been even better. Chief among these is the scene fairly early on in the movie where The Professor and his cronies are sitting around a table, discussing the Thronhill situation. I feel they give away too much of the plot's twists too soon. I would have preferred to have discovered George Kaplan's secret when Thornhill does. Playing along with the character might have made a fantastic movie even better.I'll stop. I could literally write pages. I'll sum it all up by saying that if you've never seen North By Northwest, do yourself a favor and check it out. It's not to be missed.",North by Northwest
56,gridoon,Hitchcock at his zenith.,9,28 November 1999,"""North by Northwest"" is undeniably one of Hitchcock's best movies - not to mention one of my ten personal favorites in general. A brilliant script, full of well-planned twists, Hitchcock's energetic and vivid direction, the constantly clever dialogue, the first-rate production values, an incredible score by Bernard Herrmann (who pretty much ripped-off himself the following year when he wrote the score for ""Psycho"") and several memorable sequences (the often neglected auction scene is extremely amusing) are only some of the ingredients that make this thriller so terrific. I have two minor complaints, though: the film is SLIGHTLY overlong (maybe it could have been 15 minutes shorter) and Eva Marie Saint just isn't a particularly attractive woman, compared to Grace Kelly or even to Tippi Hedren, so she is kind of miscast in the role of a ""femme fatale"". And her performance isn't in the same class with the delightful ones that Grant and Mason give. But this is still a superb movie, and it is far less dated than the early Bond films, which it probably influenced.",North by Northwest
57,sol-kay,It's in this movie where Alfred Hitchcock misses the bus,8,27 August 2006,"(Som Spoilers) Meeting with his fellow advertising executives at Manhattan's Plaza Hotel Roger Thronhill, Cary Grant, calls on one of the waiters at the Plaza's restaurant just as he announced a call for a Mr. George Kaplan. Thronhill is immediately mistaken from Kaplan and from that moment on until the end of the movie he's on the run for his life from spies police government agents and a gang of murderous thugs working for this import/exporter of government information the mysterious Phillip Vandamm, James Mason.Kidnapped and taken to the Glen Cove estate of Lester Townsend, Phillip Oben, who's being impersonated by Vandamm Roger is worked over by Vandamm hoods who think that he's US secret agent George Kaplan. After forcibly loading him up until he's plastered with a fifth of bourbon they sit him in a car and turn the engine on. By what has to be a miracle Roger survives his ordeal ending up behind bars for drunken driving with a stolen car.After being bailed out of jail by his mother Mrs. Clara Thornhill, Jessie Royce Landis,Roger goes to the Plaza looking for the mysterious George Kaplan to find out just what's going on in his almost getting killed by Vandamm's hoods for thinking that he's him! It turns that nobody ever saw Kaplan! Roger then finds a photo in the missing George Kaplan's in the hotel room of Vandamm who Roger thinks is Lester Towns. Roger goes to the UN where Towns is the representative of this UN agency called Unipol to confront him. It doesn't take long for Roger to realize that Towns isn't the person that he saw and talked to the other day at his Glen Cove estate! Before he can get anything out of him Towns is stuck from behind by a knife and Roger, whom the dying Towns fell on, is accused of murdering him when he unknowingly pulled the knife out of Towns' back making it look like he killed him.Roger's unbelievable bad luck turned out to be a stroke of genius for the C.I.A as advertising executive Roger Thornhill has become secret agent George Kaplan who in reality doesn't even exist. Now Kaplan is a real flesh and blood human being to Vandamm and his gang. At the same time this throws off any suspicion of another secret agent that's in the inner circle of the Vandamm import/export spying operation the luscious blond Eva Kendell, Eva Marie Saint.On the run with Eva Kendell helping him evade the police and the Vandamm mobsters Roger travels from New York City all the way North by Northwest going by rail to Chicago. It's later when Roger is set to meet with Eva's help the real George Kaplan he's suddenly attacked in an open field by a crop-duster plane. The plane ends up crashing into a gasoline truck, that Roger was almost run over by, in the pilots attempt in trying to run Roger down killing himself. By the time Roger got to Rapid City North Dakota he knew that he was being used by the C.I.A in the person of the professor, Leo G. Carroll. Roger also realized that his train friend and coach-mate Eva is really a C.I.A agent not the double-dealing femme fatal that he suspected her of being since the plane attack incident.Making plans to check out of the country with the goods, a spool of US Government top-secret micro-film, Vandamm through his loyal butt-kissing sidekick Leonard, Martin Landau, finds out that Eva is really working for the US Government. That has Roger come to her rescue only to end up holding on to dear life, with Eva, on the slops of Mt. Rushmore.Exciting final on Mt. Rushmore that, together with the dramatic and heart-stopping crop-duster plane chase scene, has since become Hollywood folk legend. Cary Grant is the perennially innocent bystander who gets in way over his head but somehow is able to overcome every obstacle, big or small, thrown at him. Ending up with the girl and the top secret micro-film slated for then Soviet Union. ""North by Northwest"" is a non-stop action-packed thriller that never lets up, even when there's no action going on, for a moment and to think that Roger Thronhill who was in the middle of all this excitement was divorced twice on the grounds that his two former wives stated that he was just too dull and boring of a man to live with!",North by Northwest
58,Lejink,Roger and out,9,29 December 2019,"Talk about your change of pace. After making the dark, disturbing masterpiece that was ""Vertigo"" the year before, Hitchcock decided for his next trick to lighten proceedings with the playful and sophisticated ""North By Northwest"". For those who criticise the Master for only making the one type of movie, these two consecutive movies show that while ostensibly staying within the thriller genre, it's possible to extend your range and capabilities as a director without turning wholesale to period drama or sci-fi. Put it another way, they aren't two films to watch in a double feature. Which is the better of the two, well that depends on whether you prefer Mozart over Beethoven. Or do as I do and split the difference.Just like ""Vertigo"", ""North By Northwest"" starts with a dazzling title-credits sequence, courtesy again of Saul Bass, combined with a superb theme, once again from Bernard Herrman. Then the fun really begins as we're introduced to the affable ""Mad Man"", Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, a handsome, middle-aged, snazzily-dressed advertising executive, twice divorced and if truth be told, with a bit of a mother complex. By innocently raising his hand during a meeting with clients at a swank New York hotel, just when a call goes out for an individual named George Kaplan, he is immediately swept up in an espionage plot concerning the secret exporting of state secrets to an unnamed foreign Cold War power.At the heart of these nefarious activities is the wealthy businessman Phillip Vandamm played with elan by James Mason who has in tow with him a number of besuited henchmen to do his bidding, particularly his right-hand man played with adoring devotion by Martin Landau as well as having a beautiful mistress on his arm, another classic Hitchcock blonde, this time Eva Marie Saint.The action moves along smoothly and easily, helped by sparkling, sometimes risqué dialogue especially between Grant and Saint and incorporating some of Hitchcock's most memorable set-piece sequences, especially of course the attack on Grant in the middle of nowhere by a cropduster plane and the vertigo-inducing climax atop Mount Rushmore.It's not only Hitchcock but all of his top-listed cast who are on top of their game here. Grant, still impossibly handsome in his mid-50s and wearing a suit better than anyone ever could, Saint sexy and sexually confident but with just an air of vulnerability in her compromised position, Mason coolly urbane, with a sinister edge and Landau as his homo-erotic bodyguard. Great also to see past Hitchcock supporting actors like Leo G. Carroll and Jesse Royce Landis on board for the ride with prominent parts.""North by Northwest"" brought Hitchcock to the end of the 50s, a decade where he had created a run of mostly outstanding features. As such it can be said to be the icing on the most sumptuous of cinematic cakes.",North by Northwest
59,ElMaruecan82,"The tale of an amnesic James Bond ... or put in other words, the consummate Hitchcock's film ...",9,11 June 2013,"For many years, I regarded ""North by Northwest"" as a chaotic assemblage of action-thriller vignettes for the sake of an unsubstantial plot, using the casting of an aging Cary Grant as a sorry excuse to grab more fans, definitely not worthy of its reputation. After a second viewing, I concede I didn't have the right mindset to appreciate the hidden brilliance of ""North by Northwest"".Let's start with the plot: Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising executive, mistaken for George Kaplan, a secret agent, in reality, only a decoy to distract the villainous mastermind Vandamm (James Mason) from the real agent who happens to be his mistress Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). Yet for the two thirds of the film, neither Grant nor the viewers are aware of these subtleties. For all we know, Grant is the ""wrong man"" whose attempts to prove his innocence worsens his case even more, from driving a car over a cliff after being severely imbibed and pulling a knife out of the back of a UN diplomat who's just dropped in his arms, Thornhill is the constant victim of the most unfortunate circumstances.Alfred Hitchcock directs the film as if understanding the plot was not a priority, he knows the mystery effectively conveys the nightmarish karma of Thornhill, the pawn of a game with unknown rules. For all we know, it's the Cold War and he's torn between two kind of secret agents, the good and the bad ones, Hitchcock doesn't embarrass himself with more details and uses the actors like living props to put in the most extreme and spectacular situations. When Thornhill confronts Vandamm, he pretends not to be 'George Kaplan', to which Vandamm, with Mason's deep and mellowest voice, answers ""Games? Must we?"". Thornhill is victim of the innocent-man syndrome, using the same rhetoric than a guilty one, inevitably preventing Vandamm to say more. Thornhill can't talk because he doesn't know, Vandamm can't because he doesn't believe Thornhill, at the end, it's only Hitch effectively keeping his little secret.But this secrecy is not gratuitous either, it effectively induces the paranoid feeling of the story, tapping on one of fear's most effective forms: the fear of the unknown, reaching its thrilling paroxysm in a scene set in the middle of nowhere. For eight minutes, nothing happens, Thornhill is just waiting, for whom, for what? We don't know, and we wait. The suspense is carried by our own interrogations, until a crop-duster comes, not with the friendliest intentions, contributing to the most defining moment of the film. The nightmare goes on and gets so intense that Thornhill would rather get himself arrested by the police. He doesn't know what he's escaping from, but he knows enough about his enemies. Yet the unknown can also come in the form of a beautiful creature like Eve Kendall (Eva Maria Saint) popping out in the middle of the chase and hiding Thornhill, in her bedroom after a dinner with enough sexual innuendo to make good old Grant lower his guard.But if one can't face the unknown, he can leave it nonetheless. And ironically, Thornhill is given a chance to leave until he's told by one of the 'good' agents, played by Leo G. Carroll, that he endangered Eve's life. Thornhill finally detaches from his passive status by becoming a player and making his own rules. The key is not to 'find the truth', at that point, we know everything, but the point is to stop being Hitch's puppet and finally act like a hero , for a last thrilling confrontation  and to get the girl in the process. No room for subtlety, this is not ""Vertigo"" or ""Rear Window"", this is pure hormonal Hitchcock. And Cary Grant is never more at ease and charismatic as during the last sequence, accomplishing the only act that could conceal the paranoia he endured for days, he doesn't escape from the enemy, he goes to it, his direction changed and so did Hithcock's.In a nutshell, I would say ""North by Northwest"" is like the tale of an amnesic James Bond. And Hithcocks anticipated all the ingredients that would build the secret agent's legend : the henchmen with killing methods as sophisticated and elaborate as they're ineffective, escapist settings, car chases, a suave and distinguished villain, a sensual lady and naturally the ultimate climax in Mt. Rushmore, the very sequence that catalyzed Hitchcock's desire to make the film. Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplay, intended to make the ""Hitchcock picture that would end all the Hitchcock pictures."" (and unintentionally pave the way for James Bonds' flicks) ""North by Northwest"" reassembles every Hitchcockian ingredient: the blond, the mistaken identity, the villain, the paranoia induced by the enemy's invisibility, the claustrophobia, even Martin Landau as Leonard is not your typical one-dimensional hit-man and has a sort of ""Rope"" vibe behind his sensual eyes.And the film magnificently concludes with one of the riskiest and most memorable ellipses of Cinema's history, the transition from Thornill trying to pull Eve from the Mt. Rushmore to the upper bunk of a train was classic enough, the icing on the cake concocted by Hitch himself was the penultimate shot of the train speeding up to the tunnel, whose symbolism needs no explanations. ""North by Northwest"" is undoubtedly the consummate Hitchcock movie, even more appreciated when we're familiar with his previous films. For the mark of a great director is to toy with his own trademarks and indulge himself to movies with less substance but never at the expenses of suspense and entertainment, magnificently conveyed by Bernard Herrman's theme and unforgettable opening credits.""North by Northwest"" didn't end all Hitchcock pictures but the great streak of the 50's through a triumph of spectacular entertainment, explaining why, one year after, Hitch would turn to a less ambitious format, almost B-movie like, in black-and-white, for an obscure little film called ""Psycho"".",North by Northwest
60,MOscarbradley,One of Hitchcok's best movies,10,14 March 2006,"This is probably the best loved of all Hitchcock's films and it is also one of his finest. It is a particularly daft comedy-thriller in that the plot hinges on a series of improbable events and it is hugely entertaining, full of classic set pieces. Cary Grant is the suave, debonair hero who finds himself clinging to a man with a knife in his back in the lobby of the United Nations Building. When he goes on the run, determined to find out who framed him, it isn't just the authorities who are after him but the villains as well. When he meets a leggy blonde on a train, (what is it with Hitchcock and trains?), she is not all that she seems. Eva Marie Saint plays her with an easy-going sexiness that makes her character very likable. And Grant has so much charm he gets away with playing Jessie Royce Landis' son when, in reality, she was only eight years his senior.The villains are James Mason and Martin Landau but they aren't given enough to do and as villains they don't feel threatening. What is threatening is the crop-dusting plane that appears out of an empty blue sky to chase Grant around some vast open spaces. And later, when Grant and Saint are chased over the faces on Mount Rushmore, it's our familiarity with the locations that heightens the tension. In the end the McGuffin, as Hitchcock called the device that held the plot in place, hardly matters. His genius is that he makes you care about the inconsequential things. This is a great comedy-thriller.",North by Northwest

There are so many great and iconic scenes in this film – the crop duster chase of course, and also those at the United Nations and Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock is brilliant and puts tension in scenes at each and every opportunity, as opposed to devolving a great script into silly chase scenes which lesser directors may have done. It feels like a more masterful 007 movie, and James Mason and Martin Landau are both outstanding as villains. I'm not wild about Eva Marie Saint and only feel real chemistry between her and Grant in the line ""Shall I climb up and tell you why?"" in response to his wondering why she's so good to him, but the final shot of the train speeding into a tunnel was a nice bit of tongue in cheek symbolism from Hitchcock.

64,secondtake,"At last, the new releases bring the visual brilliance up to the heights of the script and acting!!",10,10 September 2010,"North by Northwest (1959)Perhaps a perfect movie, and a perfectly Hitchcock movie. This has great sets (including a mock up copy of Mt. Rushmore and the real United Nations exterior, shot by stealth from a car). And it has three great performances from two great actors and an actress who rises to her best for this demanding role. This would be of course Cary Grant at his middle aged peak of handsome easy charm, James Mason at his middle aged peak of handsome easy charm (and very different), and Eva Marie Saint, nearly a decade after her searing appearance in ""On the Waterfront,"" very much a mature woman, alluring and yet knowing. You can see this is an adult film, by and for adults, including the very adult Hitchcock, who seems to be having the time of his life making it.The plot itself propels, scene to scene to scene, as if we are in on the chase, and yet it stops for some genuine laughs, hilarious moments snuck between the layers of cold war chill. That seems a contradiction, in a way, since this isn't at all a comedy, in the normal sense. And there are some sexual innuendos that were subtlety working around the fading Hays Code rules, and that now seem like pure brilliance. It's a smart, bubbly, entertaining mix.Some people don't get Hitchcock, and I get that. I love his films more and more over the years. ""North by Northwest"" is characteristic of his willingness, even his insistence, on keeping the artificial edges to the movie visible, the clearest example being the runaway car early in the movie, and the famous chase over our dead white presidents at the end. It's as stylish and entertaining as a movie can be, from the costumes (Grant's legendary grey suit and Saint's gorgeous dresses, picked up at Bergdorf's) to the interiors (not only the painted backdrop of the U.N. building but Grand Central, a couple of famous hotels, and a classic stuffy mansion).You can moan when Grant's character, Mr. Thornhill, grabs the knife out of the man's back, or you can notice the out of order backdrops out the window of the train (it moves from sunset to late evening to sunset, and the bridge appears and disappears in a blink). But that means you're in it for the wrong thing. (In the first case, you want him to grab the knife, because that's the classic mistake in thrillers. In the second, you're supposed to be watching Grant and Saint in one of the sexiest understated dialogs of all movies.)Yes, I like this film. It is, above all, likable.

When he's mistaken for an enigmatic spy called George Kaplan his is hurled into a partially confusing plot involving cold war traitors, secret agents and double agents.

But it IS still a bit overrated. It's shot very well, in many different locations, and there's little, if anything, to dislike about it.

68,callanvass,One of Hitchcock's many masterpieces,10,29 November 2013,"The word masterpiece seems like a broken record when it comes to Hitchcock movies. The man is responsible for so many classic movies. Not only is Hitchcock the master of suspense, but he's also king of adventure. It's a masterfully crafted adventure that never has a boring moment. It's over two hours long, and the time flies by. I give Hitchcock a lot of credit for delivering expert pacing throughout the movie. There are a lot of things I could list that make Hitchcock distinguishable from the rest. It's the incredible shot from a high building, the amazing cinematography, and It's the little things that he does, such as using matches to help the heroine during a key moment of suspense; the way he slowly masters the cropduster scene. Everything is ordinary at first, but the audience can't help but conjecture that something dangerous is about to commence. The plane trying heavily to run down Cary Grant is still one of the most suspenseful scenes in the history of cinema. And, of course. How could I forget the finale at Mount Rushmore. Hitchock had major tabs on his audience. The puppets are the audience, and Hitchock is the puppeteer. Not only does it feature witty dialog throughout, but it has some great humor thrown in at times as well. My favorites are the auction scene with Grant, and when Grant gets arrested for being intoxicated from alcohol at a police station. I won't spoil them, but I never fail to laugh whenever I see those scenes. Cary Grant plays a wonderful everyday man. He is exuberant, charismatic, with charm to spare. He is the perfect hero. Very confident, suave, but not overly cocky, and that makes all the difference. As much as I love James Stewart, I'm glad Hitchcock stuck with Grant. Eva Marie Saint gives a scintillating show. Her character has twists and turns, and for a viewer who hasn't seen this movie a few times like I have will be in for a treat with her performance. Hitchcock was reportedly fixated on Blondes. At least he always picked talented and elegant ones. James Mason makes for a tremendous bad guy. His subtly sinister performance was a lot of fun, but it's Martin Landau's eerie show as Mason's henchman that makes the biggest impression, at least in my opinion. Jessie Royce Landis is hilarious as the selfish mother of Grant's. Final Thoughts: This is a timeless film from a director who can do no wrong.

70,vincentlynch-moonoi,The last of the really good Hitchcock films? Not so sure.,7,17 February 2016,"There is no question in my mind that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the very top directors in Hollywood. And, in the past, I've always found this film to be entertaining...and still do. But in watching it more seriously this time, I find that it's far more far-fetched than I ever realized. We all have to suspend belief a bit in any fictional movie, but here...wow...too much. And yet, it's still very entertaining.I had the DVD version, but just purchased the Blue-Ray version. It's interesting with several good ""bonus features"", including the documentary ""The Master's Touch"". The Blu-Ray has been restored and the color looks great. If you want to see the magic of makeup, look at the stills of Cary Grant in the documentaries where he looks old, as compared to how he looks in the film.But, the real reason for buying the Blu-Ray is, of course, the film itself. And I'll begin with my number one criticism of many Hitchcock films -- cheap special effects. This poor trait is more noticeable with his color features, and it was pretty obvious in the DVD edition. But magic came with the restoration for Blu Ray -- the special effects look much better now. Even the faces on Mount Rushmore look much better.There are so many classic Hitchcock elements in this film: mistaken identity, the double cross, just to name two.There are a number of scenes in this film that to me just don't work well. The drunk driving scene has little suspense; compare it to the driving scene in ""Suspicion"", where there is real suspense. When Grant grabs the knife that a man at the U.N. had just been stabbed with...why would he do that? It makes no sense. Another thing that doesn't really make much sense is how genial and relaxed Grant's character is. The police are after him for a murder, which although he didn't commit it, dozens of witnesses will say he did. The bad guys have already told him they are planning to kill him, and they are hot on his trail. Yet, all he thinks of while trying to escape them is a romantic interlude. Really??? And does he wonder at all why a woman who knows he has been accused of a brutal murder is so willing to make love to him. So illogical, but I blame Hitchcock, not Grant; the director got what he wanted. And then there are the shots supposedly on top of Mount Rushmore. Grant and Saint are climbing down the face of the monument...while she is in high heels.On the other hand, there are some fascinating scenes from Grand Central Station. The scenes at the art auction are simply grand. And while far-fetched, the finale on Mount Rushmore is nifty.Of course, the great Cary Grant is...well...great here; I quite honestly ask: wasn't he always? It's surprising that his co-star, the wonderful Eva Marie Saint doesn't come into the film until 44 minutes in. One of the supporting actors here that I particularly like is Jessie Royce Landis, who plays Grant's mother; I always enjoyed her in films; she quite amusing. A Hitchcock favorite is also here -- Leo G. Carroll; another actor I always enjoyed. James Mason is a slick villain, as is subordinate Martin Landau.""North By Northwest"" was, in my old view, the last of the great Hitchcock films. Now I;m not so sure the last great Hitchcock film wasn't ""Vertigo"". In the documentary on this disc, they talk about Hitchcock knowing the difference between shock and true suspense. Unfortunately, beginning with the very next film -- ""Psycho"", followed by ""The Birds"", Hitchcock seemed to forget the difference, and he relied more on cheap shock and less on real suspense.Don't get me wrong. This is still a fun film. Just don't over-think it.",North by Northwest
71,851222,Highly enjoyable but far from realistic thriller,9,28 September 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""North by Northwest"" (1959) is more like an adventure with some mystery and thriller elements than a real thriller - it has this lightness that separates it from more serious approach of the material. And maybe that's is the strangeness and at the same time the weakness of this great and exciting movie. It is superbly photographed, features splendid cinematography (the scene with the plane in the fields is simply amazing, still after first time seeing this movie in 2015). Acting is very solid but not very serious, you won't believe for a second that one of the characters were experiencing a real peril, it is more like acting in front of the camera, not ""beeing there sort of acting"". While the story is intriguing at first, it becomes more or less intriguing by the end, and although i really enjoyed the last sequence on the monument, some acting in there weren't just that good or realistic. Overall, ""North by Northwest"" is a definitely a great movie, but more of its parts are great that the whole. It has great comedic moments, especially by Cary Grant. Eva Marie Saint is more powerful in dramatic scenes rather that in action scenes, she isn't convincing in those, she is dramatic actress, not an action heroines. Directing is solid here (by legendary Alfred Hitchcock!). ""North by Northwest"" is very enjoyable movie and i absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of movies, and while the individual scenes are almost brilliant, the movie as a whole isn't as brilliant as the sum of it's parts.",North by Northwest
72,kenjha,Hitchcock in Peak Form,10,5 June 2008,"Probably no director has made such masterpieces back to back as ""Vertigo,"" this film, and ""Psycho."" Although a bit long in the tooth, Grant is terrific as a man mistakenly drawn into a game of wits between the CIA and a group of spies. Saint is the ultimate icy blond, Mason makes an urbane villain, and Landau is creepy as Mason's sidekick. The dialog between Grant and Saint is surprisingly risqué for its time. Hitchcock keeps the action moving at a frenetic pace while building the suspense, helped by Hermann's marvelous score. The crop-dusting plane scene is justifiably famous, as is the finale atop Mount Rushmore. A masterful blend of action and comedy.",North by Northwest
73,The-Sarkologist,"Not Bad, and certainly worth watching",7,11 November 2021,"It is quite interesting watching these older films, and some of the things that were done before all of the modern technology that makes the films the way they are these days. For instance, pretty much everything was filmed on a soundstage, no doubt because it was just too expensive to basically film on location. The same is when filming is taking place inside a moving vehicle - the vehicle is clearly another soundstage, and bluescreen technology is used to make it seem like you are in a moving vehicle.Anyway, apparently this is one of Hitchcock's many great films, and I can sort of see why. Okay, it can be a little difficult watching a film that was made back in a much more conservative era, especially since sex scenes are non-existence (which means that there is a lot more sexual innuendo used, like the scene at the end where we watch a train shoots into a tunnel). Actually, the ending is rather interesting, because it cuts from the protagonist attempting to lift the love interest off a cliff to him lifting her onto a bed.The story is about this advertising executive that is kidnapped, namely because the kidnappers mistake him for somebody else. They then decide to kill him by forcing him to drink a bottle of bourbon and put him in a car. This leads to a chase across the northern part of the United States, ending up at Mount Rushmore. In fact, the name of the movie comes about from the general direction that he is heading, starting off in New York.Mind you, it is difficult to criticise a movie made by Alfred Hitchcock, though as I mentioned, it is also difficult to watch a film that at the time that was basically the cutting edge of technology, by a director that was basically the Quentin Tarrentino of his age. He certainly did push the boundaries of what was accepted, much more than what you generally expect, and of course the story itself is pretty riviting, but then again they certainly didn't call him the master of suspense for nothing.Certainly, this would have been a pretty popular film back in the day, but Hitchcock is also well know for making quite a few films, and a number of them have pretty much entered the public consciousness as being some of the all time great suspenseful thrillers. In fact Psycho ended up spawning quite a few sequals. As for this film, it certainly is a great film, especially if you can handle the fact that the style is very much what you would expect from 1960, particularly since he is rather cheeky at the end.",North by Northwest
74,briancham1994,Hitchcock does James Bond,8,14 September 2021,"As trite as the comparison is, this really is a prototypical James Bond with an Alfred Hitchcock flair. I wouldn't be surprised if the early James Bond films were in fact based on North by Northwest. The protagonist is a sharp advertising executive who has been thrust into the world of espionage. Played wonderfully by Cary Grant, he is at first reluctant and frustrated but later has his fun with the scenario, offering suave one-liners and exciting action scenes. The film takes its time to set up the scenario and the characters, offering a richer experience than modern action movies. The sneaky escapes, character interactions and subterfuge make the film very rewarding to watch as there is so much hidden meaning to everything. One star off for obvious plot holes though.",North by Northwest
75,redryan64,What more can be said?,10,9 December 2015,"ONCE AGAIN, IT appears that partnering co-author and imaginary friend, Schultz, and myself have long overlooked the pleasure of writing a review of what certainly must be considered among the greatest ever. Perhaps this was an oversight on our part; for, being quite familiar with it and having screened it seemingly countless times over the past half century or so, we probably just thought we'd already done one. (See what happens when you get a little long in the tooth, eh Schultz?)HAVING DISPENSED WITH this perhaps egocentric and self-indulgent bit of written fun, we'll now attempt to get down to a fitting write-up of this all time favourite of so many.WHAT MORE CAN be said of such a singularly great piece of cinema? From stem to stern, beginning to end, even top to bottom, we're challenged, entertained, amused and totally satisfied. In every department; be it music (perhaps Bernard Hermann's most original score), mystery plotting, multi city filming locations, pacing and rep-oratory style assembly of players, all come together in a great single effort.ENGINEERING THE NEARLY perfect assembly of the final product is the master of the suspense story himself, Alfred Hitchcock. In keeping with some of his well established trademarks, he continued with the traditions established in a career that dated back to the last days of the Silents and the Ascent of the Talkies in his native England.FOR ONE, HE made his obligatory on-screen appearance in the very early scene catching a bus on a busy New York City street. His second traditional element is that of having the portrayal of great tension played out against otherwise peaceful, prim & proper, even bland & boring. Such is the confrontation and subsequent cleverly engineered escape at the Fine Art Auction.HITCH HAS ALSO long enjoyed putting his protagonist(s) in great peril against the backdrop of a well known, patriotically charged location. In THE SABOTEUR (Universal, 1941), it was the Statue of Liberty. In today's reviewed film, it is a pulse-pounding chase across the faced of the Mount Rushmore Memorial.THIS MOVIE IS one of those that one can see over and over again and still enjoy. So, our prescription calls for you to do so. And you sure won't be alone; what with the stone countenances of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt all looking in at story's end! SCHULTZ AND MESELF give it **** (4 Stars), one for each President making his stone-faced cameo. And Schultz asks: ""Ain't there two Roosevelts?""",North by Northwest
76,zkonedog,A Well-Constructed Spy Romp,7,7 March 2017,"When it comes to Alfred Hitchcock pictures, his ""MacGuffin"" plot style is quite a bit overused (especially by today's standards). ""North By Northwest"" contains that same style of film-making. However, this film is so well-constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.For a basic plot summary, ""North by Northwest"" follows the exploits of one Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), who is mistaken for another man and happens to fall into a Cold War spy ring led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Along the way, Thornhill is romanced (and does a fair share of the romancing) by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose character may not be exactly who she seems.In terms of plot, this is one of Hitchcock's best...if only for the first half of the film when the mystery of ""Thornhill/Kaplan"" is still brewing. Once the truth is disclosed, however, the MacGuffin quickly becomes apparent and kind of turns the movie into a simply spy tale (and thus it loses a little luster).The acting is terrific, as Hitch makes the ""bad guys"" genuinely creepy (I mean, Martin Landau's face alone is enough to do that!) and showcases Grant & Saint throughout.Bernard Hermann's soundtrack also deserves a good chunk of the credit for keeping the latter portions of this movie interesting, as those famous Hermann strings refuse to let viewers relax even for a moment during the climactic moments.Overall, ""North by Northwest"" is a very good Hitchcock effort that deserves watching by any fan of the director or just cinema buffs in general. A 3.5 ranking would be my exact choice, but because of it being so well-made, I bump it up to four stars.",North by Northwest
77,johnnyboyz,"Combining that element of chase, espionage and sheer horror combined with action; North By Northwest is a winner.",8,12 May 2009,"North by Northwest manages to cover just about every emotion you might feel during a good, old fashioned romp. There are scenes in the film of great, comic timing; there are sequences when you are frightened for the characters; there are times when you're frustrated or angry at certain occurrences and there are others when the film dips into potential romance and you experience the emotions that come with that. The whole film-watching experience is, of course, juxtaposed by Cary Grant's relaxed and somewhat methodical approach to everything – encouraging a certain ease on the audience, like a parent or guardian comforting a child with the words ""it's only a movie"" every so often.North By Northwest reminded me of a film from 1945 named 'Detour', a short, sharp and quite brilliant little B-movie. But Hitchcock knows what he's doing here, shooting and constructing North by Northwest as the sort of film you mightn't expect many people to turn up for; shooting and constructing it like the sort of film that, if a lot of people did turn up, wouldn't expect an awful lot out of. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind, dabbling in and out of a couple of genres; twisting audience emotion and redefining film language all at once.Very early on in the film, we are established to be on a busy New York street. Cary Grant's lead character named Roger Thornhill walks, talks and mingles with whoever he needs to as other pedestrians try to get the better of others on a minute scale by hogging the pavement as they get on with whatever they're doing. The opening establishes a few things, namely Roger's quick wit and ability to gauge scenarios in fast moving and bustling locations. This is put across via the incidence during which he manages to hail a cab amidst the chaos and acts as a precursor for things to come when his skills will be pushed to much further extremes. Incidentally, the beginning is supposed to get across this chaotic 'world' full of 'one-upmanship', in which the film will take place, further in which people exist to get the better of one another. The notion of a busy street on which you must keep your wits about you purely to be able to walk without hassle is Hitchcock fore-warning the themes of the film's narrative, a film in which there will be 'others' out looking to damage those un-alert, and it is Thornhill's own qualities that ultimately take him as far as he goes.The set up involves mistaken identity and Thornhill getting snatched from a prior arrangement by some thugs to meet a certain Phillip Vandamm (Mason), who mistakes him for someone else named George Kaplan. Through one reason or another, and an early example of Hitchcock deliberately veering off into some sort of realm of horror, Thornhill is dumped and left for dead by the thugs, but takes it on himself to figure out who Kaplan really is. What follows is a framing for murder and a 'A 3000 MILE CHASE . . . That blazes a trail of TERROR to a gripping, spine-chilling climax!'; at least according to the tag-line – but you'd be pretty hard pressed not to agree with the statement anyway.From here, North by Northwest doesn't really let up. Its countless inspirations since can range from anything from Three Days of the Condor, to the film THAT inspired ie; The Bourne Identity to a similarly easy-on-the-eye-and-mind 2004 B-Movie entitled Cellular. The cause and effect driven idea shoots from one location to another, incorporating all sorts of frightening but entertaining ideas and scenes. The film pauses for sexual tension, laughs and thrills in equal measure; never loosing sight of its Cold War era driven aura of espionage, politics, mistaken identity and chase.Following the framing for murder, Thornhill travels to Chicago for what should be a meeting Kaplan was due to attend. It is on the train travelling to this destination he meets Eve Kendall (Saint), a character Hitchcock brilliantly sets up by having her recognise Thornhill as the man wanted by police but refrains from turning him in. The very dangerous persona that is set up for Eve is confirmed when, in addition to not particularly flinching when she discovers who Thornhill is, she quite easily lies to police regarding Thornhill's whereabouts by hiding him in a her train compartment.As the film develops, particular narrative ideas to do with undercover agents and microfilms open up but I find it remarkable that this film, with all the elements of paranoia and mistaken identity with somewhat of a labyrinth of a narrative that opens up in due course, seems to be mostly remembered for its individual scenes: a crop dusting chase, an escape on Mount Rushmoor and a particularly eye-brow raising final shot. We all know about Psycho and the shower scene and who gets killed there and what the twist is; we all know about Rear Window and that a certain someone is in a helpless physical position as things tighten around them, but here, popular culture hasn't seemed to have ruined what is, essentially, a really well played out thriller with plot twists, turns and frightening set pieces. While always seemingly remembered for individual moments, North by Northwest is a truly wonderful picture that presents a genuinely likable lead; throws them into the firing line; develops other characters accordingly and rounds it all off with a brilliantly unravelled plot complete with current affairs for the day, surely one of Hitchcock's finest.",North by Northwest
78,filipemanuelneto,Another excellent film by Alfred Hitchcock.,6,6 August 2020,"Personally, this is not one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock films, although it is one of the most acclaimed and one of the most interesting. The script revolves around a confusion of identities, where an ordinary citizen is mistaken for a spy and ends up in a tremendous confusion with gigantic repercussions on his personal life and national security.The script is quite good and the story has no dead moments. It entertains the audience in a perfect way until the end and makes us curious to know what is really going on, curiosity being an important part of what keeps us stuck in the film (and one of the reasons I prefer to hardly talk about the plot). The main character, played by Cary Grant, was so well thought out that we quickly established an affective and sympathetic link with her, caring about what will happen to her. It goes without saying that, although the cast is very good, it is really Cary Grant who stands out here. Eva Marie Saint is good, but she never leaves the shadow of the male protagonist. Another actor that deserves a positive note is Martin Landau.Technically, it is an impeccable film, to the taste of director Hitchcock. It is full of symbolic scenes or with more than one meaning, some of them bordering on the dreamlike. Some of the scenes are truly striking, like those that were shot on Mount Rushmore. The camera and film work is excellent and cinematography perfectly harmonizes color, light, shadow and contrast, resulting in a visually elegant film, although with the characteristics of a film of its time, of course. The soundtrack is also quite good, as are the sets and costumes.",North by Northwest

80,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A film that will always be able to hold its own against modern adventure thrillers,9,3 May 2008,"There's something so timeless about ""North by Northwest"" and it's not necessarily that it will echo with any generation. Cary Grant's Roger Thornhill, for example, feels a little foreign among today's thriller protagonists (accent aside) as a 50-year-old everyday man thrown into a mess of a government situation. The action is certainly not big- budget like modern films either with the exception of one explosion. The ""it"" that ""Northwest"" has is something more unique and a lot of it stems from great thriller writing and of course the direction of Sir Alfred Hitchcock.""Northwest"" follows the story of how Thornhill is taken against his will and accused of being a man named George Kaplan. These men try and kill Thornhill and have concocted elaborate cover-ups, to the point that Thornhill has no choice but to do whatever he must to prove his innocence, which actually leads him deeper into the mystery of George Kaplan. The writing of Ernest Lehman is absolutely terrific and it seems a shame that Hitchcock never collaborated with him again. The dialogue is not only very pointed and helpful to the plot, but also the plot movement with its twists and turns and clever way of revealing information to the viewer is simply classic Cold War spy thriller stuff, the skeletal structure that would later become synonymous with someone by the name of James Bond, despite ""North by Northwest"" predating Bond by three years.Although Roger Thornhill has nothing on James Bond, ""North by Northwest"" gets to boast Hitchcock's signature directing. No one seems to choose better moments to employ certain shot techniques than Hitchcock. He knows how to turn the best parts of the film into highly memorable and often times unforgettable scenes. The crop-duster attack is easily one of the greatest scenes in thriller movie history, specifically the shot where he's running as the plane gets larger and closer in the background. The difference between Hitchcock and the rest when it comes to a cross-country thriller like this is largely editing and length of takes. Hitchcock creates intensity by letting things build, like lengthy takes of the cars driving down the highway or the plane circling around to make another pass.From Thornhill's drunken escape to the cropduster sequence to a finale on Mount Rushmore, so much of ""North by Northwest"" remains unique, even to this day, even after all the Bond movies modeled after it and despite archetypes like Eva Marie Saint's femme fatale character. It has a certain inventiveness (and a certain director) that will always allow it to stand out.~Steven CThanks for reading!

82,funkyfry,One of Hitch's better flicks,8,28 October 2002,"Somewhat overblown suspense thriller has exciting plot twists and Cary Grant's unique screen presence to recommend it.  Well directed, tells the story of an advertising man mistaken for a decoy created by the CIA, who is hunted across the nation and ends up falling for the CIA's undercover agent -- Marie-Saint.  The ""Open paranoia"" scene in the cropdusting field is a great sequence.  Here Hitchcock succeeds often in not being obvious, remaining playful, and pleasing the audience a lot.I must respond to the comments I read on here by user ""tedg"" -- I did not find them illuminating.  On the contrary, they seem to be the products of a confused mind, and someone who has not paid much attention to what he's saying before putting it in print.  First of all, as to his complaint about the quality of the sets, they are not as he claims ""junk"" but actually well-made sets.  I'd like to see him, or anybody, given a lot of money create a duplication of the monument in question that would look better -- it just can't be done, because the monument itself is made of stone and took decades and millions of dollars to make.  Also, ""tedg"" comments on the character played by Marie-Saint (hardly my favorite actress) -- he notes that she plays a ""prostitute"" who is turned patriotic, but he doesn't seem to have been paying enough attention to the film to notice that in the end it is revealed that she is an undercover CIA agent, and not a prostitute at all.Users like this should definately not turn off their vcrs before the end of a movie if they're going to try to post thoughtful comments on it.",North by Northwest
83,southdavid,Keep Calm and Cary On.,9,1 October 2020,"""North by Northwest"" is, put simply, wonderful. One of Cinema's timeless classics.Via an unfortunate misunderstanding, advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is believed to be a US spy named George Kaplan. Dragged into international espionage, pursued by the men of Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) and later the police, following a murder at the UN, Thornhill boards a train and meets Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) who agree to help him. Chased across the country, Thornhill gets the chance to turn the tables when he discovers that Eve is not who she seems.Timeless really is the word for ""North by Northwest"". Of course the fashion and technology has changed, as has mid-afternoon drinking culture, but the witty, funny dialogue and the iconic action moments will never go out of style. Neither will Saul Bass' oft imitated opening title sequence, nor the sly wit of Hitchcock's direction.I accept the criticism that it's not, perhaps, the most realistic film ever made, or that it's Hitchcock returning to a relatively similar themes to ""The Lady Vanishes"" but it's Cary Grant cracking wise in a tailored suit, it's a cropdusting plane circling in the distance, it's James Mason saying anything in that unique accent, it's considering how much Mason's house would be worth if it were real, it's picking up on the daring subtext that Landau added to his performance, it's sliding down the edge of Mount Rushmore, it's a shot of a train entering a tunnel.It's not even Hitchcock's best film, but still it's an undeniable masterpiece.",North by Northwest
84,jzappa,"Now I Don't Mind Being Abducted Every Now and Then, But",8,3 November 2011,"Over time, it seems like Hitchcock went from a sure-fire formula for fast-paced thrillers to glossy melodramas to thrillers of a philosophically and symbolically ambitious order. North by Northwest looks like a tinker toy or a daydream after The Wrong Man and Vertigo. Hitchcock and Lehman are not especially serious about their whodunit and allow the spirit of Hitchcock's Gaumont halcyon days to breathe with new VistaVision life. With a whimsical bearing and an offhand drollness, they're spinning their welcomingly familiar wheels right from the start as they unravel a cheerfully unlikely plot. Their literal and figurative pinnacle is carried a little too far and there's the occasional hazier patch, but they do pilot us on a most picturesque, absorbing and joyous chase. Hitchcock's glossy, ironic, mistrustful thriller encapsulated the spirit of the time entirely: Cold War dubiousness, refined modernization, the entomological commotion of city life and a suggestion of alarm behind the silky suits of prosperity.Shadow of a Doubt was another, in my opinion better, thriller by Hitchcock that evoked the darkness beneath a civilized gloss. It was one of the things Hitchcock was best at doing. He could make a cymbal a signal of death and a glass of milk too, for that matter. But what makes North by Northwest charming in its own right, aside from one of the greatest film scores ever written, is its modernism. It's not a matter of tradition as a façade, but the closest thing to the life we return to when the movie's over. This is the world being lived in at the moment of the story's unraveling. And yet you can still be picked out of huge crowd and mistaken for a spy. A fancy art auction can still be a life-or-death strategy game for a microfilm of government secrets.Cary Grant gives the 39 Steps and Saboteur formula a three-dimensional quality with a persona that had aged like wine. Thinking of the dashing, black-haired dork of The Awful Truth or Gunga Din or Arsenic and Old Lace, it's so welcome to see him twenty years later managing those inimitable contortions, flabbergasted looks, nippy grins and gallantry with certified style and refinement. He may be the wrong guy, but he's still culpable for the smugness, materialism and negligence in his expository interactions. Thornhill is a lucrative ad exec, making a living by misrepresenting truth and deluding society. He shall be divested of his self-satisfied finish by progressively more noxious situations, and redress his improprieties before he can be freed from indictments of lethal ones.This, more in the first half of the movie than the second, brings out the best of his bone-dry incredulity. He's hilarious because of how petty he makes his more-than-legitimate outrage seem, like when he tells his kidnappers it's one thing to be abducted, but he had tickets for the theatre tonight that he was very much looking forward to. Even close to the end, he's justifying his endangerment of himself to see all the intrigue through to the finish because he doesn't want to shortchange the incomes of his dependent mother, ex-wife and bartender.Again though, if you need Cary to play off a female co-star, why in the world would it not be Irene Dunne? You need a distinctive, idiosyncratic charmer to add depth to Eve Kendall, because she's nothing more than another in Hitchcock's long line of passive blonde decorations. And after Doris Day drew out one of his fullest, most urgent female performances in The Man Who Knew Too Much, the safe, cursory timidity of the boundaries succumbed to by Jill St. John seems bolstered.While not as cunningly inventive as Strangers on a Train, or as shrewdly flirtatious as Notorious, this is one of Hitchcock's most pleasurable American thrillers. It just doesn't have the drum-tight, pared-down briskness of The 39 Steps or The Lady Vanishes, so it carries on too long, softening the mold holding together an assortment of scenes and actions it's obliged to make room for, such as the crop-duster sequence of course, as well as the manhunt on Mt. Rushmore, or Thornhill evading his pursuers at an auction by shocking the room with ludicrous bids. Still though, they're model set pieces, with a graciously high cinematic spirit.",North by Northwest
85,Vartiainen,Surprisingly cheerful for a Hitchcock film,7,3 December 2018,"If you had to name Alfred Hitchcock's two most influential films, you could not go wrong with Vertigo and Psycho. Both are dark psychological thrillers that delve deep into the human psyche, in which you can trust no one or anything, and even though, according to the customs of the time, the good guys win in the end, they're not what we would call clean victories.North by Northwest happens to be the film Hitchcock filmed in between these two monoliths. And it's clear he had decided that he needed a break, because by his standards this is almost a holiday film. But, it's still very much a Hitchcock film. The camerawork is superb and rather noticeable, but in a good way. The characters have that Hitchcock feel to them. And the plot is still a mystery story.But somehow it feels more lighthearted than usual. And I think it is the dialogue that's to blame. Plus the music that's almost frivolous in tone. This is a spy thriller where gorgeous men and women exchange witty one-liners over martini glasses, the villains twirl their mustaches and the death traps defy all expectations. It is almost like a proto Roger Moore James Bond film, over a decade in advance.And yet it is a Hitchcock film, with all the goodies that usual implies. Aside from the nail-biting corkscrew of piling tension, that is. Is it his best film? Nah, but it's a breath of fresh air if you've watched a whole bunch of his films and want something a bit lighter, but still in the same style.",North by Northwest
86,robert-temple-1,"The greatest Hitchcock film, stunning and perfect",10,12 December 2017,"This film is probably where Hitchcock's genius rose to its greatest height. I have seen it several times over the years, and it keeps getting better and better. Now we have a Blu-ray remastered version, so I have seen it again, all crisp and new. A large part of the success of this film is due to Ernest Lehman, who wrote the screenplay. He was one of Hollywood's top screenwriters and his skills were crucial in making this story work. The film is gripping from the first scene to the last, and never loses its tension for a moment. Cary Grant's somewhat weird personality was perfect for the lead role in this tale of mysterious intrigue. The combination of his droll insouciance and dry humour with his expressions of continually surprised astonishment is just the right mix. I can't think of any other actor who could so perfectly have compounded the variegated tinctures of ambiguity into this sublime decoction of suspense. (What do you mean, that last sentence was affected?) As for Eva Marie Saint, never was she so glorious as in this picture. She has just the right mix as well. And those two mixes went well together, and are the very opposite of oil and water. Or to put it another way, everything gells. And then there is James Mason as the unctuous smoothie bad guy. He really knew how to be convincing at that, and the way he puts his hand on Eva Marie Saint's shoulder in the auction room, to say 'you are mine', is done so delicately but so emphatically. He was always the master of understatement, Every gesture, every grimace is perfectly planned and plotted. Hitchcock was passionate about story-boarding all his films, and this one is a living story-board. Not one thing is out of place, the film was perfectly executed according to plan. It ticks better than any Swiss watch in history. Tick, tick, tick, and the wheels go round and things happen relentlessly, all precisely timed. The most famous episode in this film is probably when Cary Grant gets off a bus in the middle of a corn field in absolutely nowhere and a crop-spraying plane comes after him, trying to kill him. Who says such things never happen? I saw it with my own eyes, in a Hitchcock film, so it must be true.",North by Northwest
87,bsmith5552,Superb Hitchcock Thriller!,9,20 October 2001,"""North By Northwest"" is another of Alfred Hitchcock's thrillers where an ordinary man is put into an extraordinary situation. As in most of these movies, the hero has to quickly adapt to his situation or perish. This time it is Cary Grant who is thrust into a world of international intrigue when is mistaken by villain James Mason for an American operative named George Kaplan (the film's ""McGuffan"" by the way). Along the way he is seduced by Mason's mistress (Eva Marie Saint) while being pursued by Mason and his cronies from New York to Chicago to South Dakota and ultimately to Mount Rushmore for the film's climax. ""North By Northwest"" is full of classic Hitchcock moments. First,there is Grant's frustration and fear as he tries to explain to Mason that he is not the person they are seeking. Next, the scene in the cornfield where Grant is isolated and attacked by a plane is pure Hitchcock. Then we have the art auction where he cleverly escapes Mason's henchmen and finally, the finale at Mount Rushmore in a scene reminiscent of a similar one in ""Sabotage"" (1942) (which took place at the top of the Statue of Liberty). The cast, as in most Hitchcock films is excellent. Grant is understandably confused and frightened as the the hero, Eva Marie Saint has never been sexier as the femme fatale, James Mason is suave and sinister as the villain and Martin Landau in an early role, is good as Mason's chief henchman. Hitchcock regular Leo G. Carroll is cold heartedly sinister as the ""professor"". Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother (she was about Grant's real age) is wasted and unnecessary to the plot. The only problem that I have with this and other Hitchcock films is his over reliance on back projection and soundstage ""exteriors"". Other than that. ""North By Northwest"" has to be considered as one of Hitchcock's best. Watch for Hitchcock's hilarious cameo appearance at the end of the opening credits.",North by Northwest
88,ackstasis,"""That's funny, that plane's dustin' crops where there ain't no crops""",9,21 July 2009,"Following the commercial failure of 'Vertigo (1958),' Alfred Hitchcock needed a crowd-pleaser. He certainly gave us one. 'North by Northwest (1959)' might just be the most outright entertaining of the director's pictures, a film that exists solely to give its audience a rollicking good time. Throughout his career, Hitchcock often utilised his established stars – for example, Cary Grant in 'Suspicion (1941)' or James Stewart in 'Vertigo (1958)' – as an opportunity to deconstruct their ingrained public image. Here, instead, he simply goes with the flow. In his fourth and final film for the Master of Suspense, Cary Grant plays with a familiar persona – debonair and charming, cocky and mischievous. His Roger O. Thornhill (the arbitrary middle initial an overt jab at producer David O. Selznick) is an advertising executive, superficial and self-serving, but with the charisma to support these dastardly qualities. Such a man is surely in need of a comeuppance, and Hitchcock delights in every plot twist that sees Thornhill plunged ever further into a sadistic practical joke cooked up by the Cold War.Ernest Lehman's screenplay outwardly appears to be little but a selection of spectacular set-pieces strung together by Hitchcock's trademark ""wrong man"" motif, but it nonetheless amply supports its running-time (among the director's longest). Cary Grant's charming banter with double-agent Eva Marie Saint is tinged with sly sexual innuendo, and only Hitchcock could have ended a film with the hero's train entering the leading ladies'. well, you get the picture. James Mason brings a dignified vulnerability to the role of Commie spy Phillip Vandamm, but Hitchcock seems only marginally interested in the character, and, indeed, his ultimate fate is completely skipped over (instead, Martin Landau's vicious henchman is given an arch-villain's death). Hitchcock's climax atop a studio reconstruction of Mount Rushmore is only effective thanks to Bernard Hermann's momentous score, but other sequences reek of the director's astonishing aptitude for suspense. The breathless crop-duster ambush is worthy of every accolade that has been bestowed upon it, and Grant's comedic talents shine during both a drunken roadside escape and an impromptu auction-house heckle.That the audience learns of George Kaplan's fictitiousness long before Thornhill ever does may admittedly weaken the suspense, but Hitchcock's motives are instead to recruit the audience into his own position, as director, of omnipotent power. Beneath its surface, 'North by Northwest' appears to be a subtle swing at Cold War politics, and particularly the power wielded by the FBI and government committees like the HUAC. As Thornhill fights to unravel himself from a tangled web of deception and espionage, Hitchcock unexpectedly crosses to a panel of FBI agents, headed by Leo G. Carroll, who bicker indifferently over the mess into which they've got this oblivious pawn. These government employees are happy to sit listlessly by as citizens place their lives on the line, their quarrels bizarrely resembling the conversations of the gods in 'Jason and the Argonauts (1963).' Indeed, like deities, the FBI men wield the power to invent (Kaplan), destroy, or even resurrect (Thornhill) human beings, and intercede sporadically in a suitably Deus Ex Machina-like fashion.",North by Northwest
89,dee.reid,"An excellent, first-class thriller - thrilling, chilling, and funny; one of Hitchcock's best",10,28 November 2009,"""North by Northwest"" may very well be one of the most entertaining and highly enjoyable thrillers ever made by a major Hollywood studio. I mean that, really. Expertly directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film fires an arsenal of thrills, chills, first-rate performances from a first-rate cast, spectacular action set-pieces, and humor. Even with the humor, you can forget how profoundly disturbing this movie can be at times, but it's all part of the fun of ""North by Northwest.""I'll be the first ever to admit that I'm no Hitchcock fanatic in even the slightest sense, but there is one reason to believe that he was one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived. The man knew his way around films in a way few filmmakers today will ever be; today's wannabe directors, take note. The way he composes his scenes, his actors, and the on-screen action with expert precision and style shows that he always knew what he was doing when he was behind the camera, and he rightfully earned the respect as a master filmmaker.The film toys with the idea of identity. ""North by Northwest"" begins with a kidnapping, and a case of mistaken identity: a hapless Manhattan advertising executive, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is taken hostage by hired goons and brought to the lavish estate of one Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Here, he is harshly interrogated by his captors, who believe that he is really a secret agent of the government named George Kaplan. Thornhill tries to prove his innocence to them to no avail, and is soon plunged into a series of harrowing events of escalating danger, adventure and magnitude, culminating in him dangling for his dear life from Mt. Rushmore with the would-be love of his life Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), the mysterious woman he met while on a train trying to elude his would-be captors.""North by Northwest"" may very well be one of the greatest chase movies ever made. The movie itself is a slow-burn of escalating danger and suspense, as Our Hero Roger Thornhill finds himself thrust into events that he can neither understand or comprehend. And we identify with the confusion he has over the surreal turn-of-events that have taken over his life. Cary Grant infuses his character with enough confusion and witty one-liners (many of which are actually quite funny and earn some much-needed laughs to alleviate the suspense) that he earns our sympathy as an Everyman who is forced to take the reins of being a hero to fight for his life against an unspeakable evil.Of course, this film is also noteworthy for its groundbreaking and suspenseful action sequences, the most spectacular of which is the infamous ""crop-dusting"" scene, which has to be seen to be truly believed. That scene alone is worth the price of the admission. Rather than waste time on special effects and explosions and things of that nature (today's filmmakers, again take note), Hitchcock instead relies on the tension and the slow build-up so that he lets us have it with a one-two punch to the gut. Hitchcock also makes expert use of wide open spaces during this scene, and the wide-angle lens of his camera, so that even even when an airplane is the only thing we see in a wide-angle shot of a corn field, there is still an ever-looming sense of danger that something else could jump out at us from anywhere on the screen.""North by Northwest"" is an expertly directed thriller from the ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock. Today's filmmakers should definitely take note of this film and look for the many reasons for why it is as good as it is. His next film after this was of course the granddaddy of today's slasher flicks (and my personal favorite Hitchcock movie ever), 1960's ""Psycho.""10/10",North by Northwest

Mason shines in these kinds of roles because of his sharp wit and fiery demeanor. He never gets mad, he just hisses at you, like a snake. The auction scene is an example of Mason's power in these roles. The rest of the film is also exciting with Grant mixing humor and intrigue to find the answers. Saint is sensual in her role.

Cary Grant may have been a few years too old for this leading role, but the fast-paced, ever-intensifying script that envelopes him never gives us the chance to sit and stew on it. The concept that powers the whole bag is astonishingly simple, and once it's knocked out of the way in the first act, the picture is then perfectly happy to gradually up the stakes and riff on the premise for the rest of its allotted time. It's a testament to the creativity of the filmmakers that it still feels so fresh and untainted today, in the era of the derivative knock-off, with only a few dated automobiles and touches of public etiquette reminding us it's actually closing in on sixty years of age.

He milks every drop of suspense and along the way injects a lot of humor .A brisk screenplay by Ernest Lehman a Cary Grant that is just pure delight, Eva Marie Saint fresh out of her Oscar from ""On the Waterfront"" is an icy blonde with a brain and providing a good number of delightful moments. Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint are perfect in the leads and James Mason and Martin Landau are highly satisfactory villains.It's all great fun, with Grant mistaken in the opening scene for a Federal Intelligence agent who doesn't really exist. He is soon swept up in a an amusing and suspenseful twist of plot complications involving spies and counterspies with an unpredictable series of nail-biting scenes that never let up until the smashing climax at Mount Rushmore. The dust-cropping scene is a highlight, skillfully edited and photographed for maximum effect.As usual, the suspense begins with the opening credits as Bernard Herrmann's staccato notes of music prepare us for what follows.

It was also one of his typical films-a am is framed for a crime (read:murder) and trapped by the circumstantial and other evidence. There were several classic scenes in this movie, like the chase scene on Mount Rushmore, the diner scene (watch for the little kid to plug his ears BEFORE Eva Marie Saint reaches into her purse pulls out her gun and shoots Cary Grant-classic mistake in a classic scene in a classic film), and the crop duster chase scene. I loved it when they dumped alcohol into him, made him drive, and when he returned they hid and staged everything. Pierce Brosnan referred to this in Remington Steele.

Nasty James Mason and his fey accomplice Martin Landau chase Grant throughout the US leading up to a now famous climax atop Mt. Rushmore. Eva Marie Saint is the REAL govt. agent also caught up in the mix. It's directed at break neck speed with Hitchcock having A LOT of fun (note that final shot!).

98,yusufpiskin,35mm..,9,22 March 2020,"North by Northwest is famous because of one scene. Now, that doesn't mean the rest of it is lacking, as it should be common knowledge of its solidified place in the canon of the greatest American films in the history of the cinema, but the zenith is found in a classic Hitchcock concept: the image of the pursuer and the pursued. Its famous sequence of a crop-duster aircraft leaping towards Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill in the Midwest countryside - bullets flying near his dives for survival - is constructed through the context of a world unknown: a place not designed for your color or creed or gender or social status. It is an environment, depicted via the absurd logic of a home becoming a prison, which is entirely turned against you. It is what many people feel like when they wake up in the morning. Thornhill's anxiety of normal, simple structures and people, such as the bus and the man waiting for it, defines a clash between uncomfortable normalcy of culture and those who oppose the system because they don't know how else to live. In Hitchcock's universe, an airplane with assassins at the controls is an obvious occurrence, but for Thornhill, it is a symbol of confinement and hostile order taking hold of even the most inhuman machine and making it ruthless. What else to do but run?",North by Northwest
99,dwpollar,Okay mistaken identity thriller by Alfred Hitchcock...,5,10 June 2020,"1st watched 3/12/2017:
Okay mistaken identity thriller by Alfred Hitchcock. I expected more from this much-heralded money maker from the great director. I felt like he almost relied too much on the like-ability of the star Cary Grant to try and pull this one off instead of his film-making. The movie was interesting early with Grant given a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor, as an advertising agent who is mistaken for someone else, and kidnapped. The early twists kept my interest, but when the focus became the possible romance between him and the Eva Marie Saint character - a little around half way thru - it became dull. I do admit that they have one of the hottest pre-code exchanges I have seen on film, and the interesting use of the United Nations and Mount Rushmore is definitely different, but this doesn't make a whole movie. What makes a thriller are twists and turns not romantic interests. It's ok to have this as long as it doesn't simplify the story - ultimately this movie does this. Do we really care whether the stars get together in the end ? Not I - I know it's going to happen - what matters is what happens between. James Mason is the ""so-called"" mean guy in the story, but in my opinion - he is a little too refined in the part. I'm glad I saw the movie, but nothing really made me want to see it again.",North by Northwest
100,kluseba,Influential spy epic,7,5 January 2019,"North by Northwest, which has horrible translations to French with La mort aux trousses and German with Der unsichtbare Dritte, is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movies. This vivid action-thriller and spy epic has influenced franchises like James Bond and many others. Despite a certain nostalgic charm regarding clothes, lifestyles and settings, the movie has aged quite well and is still very entertaining sixty years after its initial release and beyond.The story revolves around a charming advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent, kidnapped, poisoned and left for dead. He survives by chance but nobody seems to believe his story and he is instead charged with driving under the influence. The ambitious young man desires to clear his name and starts investigating. Soon enough, he is in the middle of a dangerous conflict between a shady businessman and his associates and the real government agents he has been mistaken for. Along with a mysterious woman who befriends and helps him on a train ride, he travels northwest through the United States of America to figure out what he has been involved with.North by Northwest convinces on numerous levels. The story is twisted, mysterious and dynamic as it will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The iconic action sequences have stood the test of time and are still breathtaking to watch. The unfirgettable locations are chosen with care, intellect and precision. The camera work is very precise and still an example to follow by contemporary standards. The acting performances are charismatic and especially the lead character is truly unique.There are only two minor elements that need to be criticized. The female lead character feels somewhat superficial as she almost instantly falls in love with a perfect stranger despite her pivotal role in the story. Another thing that bothered me was the abrupt ending which could have been a little bit more fluid without overstaying its welcome.Still, North by Northwest is a movie you should watch at least once in your lifetime if you like crime films in general and spy movies in particular.",North by Northwest

102,slokes,"Smoke and mirrors, without apologies",8,10 November 2003,"The one famous gaffe people point out in this film is when a small boy can be seen plugging his ears just before Eva Marie Saint brings her café conversation with Cary Grant to a sudden end. Another gaffe, just as egregious and apparent but not nearly as commented on, is when Cary and Eva, clutching an incriminating statute, are rock-climbing around a quartet of famous presidential heads until a bad guy suddenly appears and leaps upon him. Whereupon the surprised, backward-falling Cary has the presence of mind to hand the statute to Eva, who takes his from him whilst in mid-scream. Do me a favor and read that last sentence again. What director today would allow such a scene past the editing room?But it just doesn't matter: IMDB voters at this writing have placed the 44-year-old `North By Northwest' ahead of all but 18 movies ever made, including 14 which have nothing to do with Frodo Baggins or Darth Vader. That's pretty damn impressive. What the hell were they thinking? The only Hitchcock movie they rate higher is ""Rear Window;"" I can think of at least seven or eight Hitchcocks I'd rank over ""North By Northwest."" [None of them are ""Rear Window.""]The truth is this film is so popular because it is so good. Not great, but very, very good, in a way that anticipates a lot of the direction of mass entertainment to come and thus speaks to people in a way `Vertigo' or `Strangers On A Train' do not. People talk about how forward thinking ""Psycho"" is, and it is, but more directors took note of the just-as-clever-but-more-mainstream approach of ""North By Northwest."" The last four decade have been chock full of flicks serving up suspense, sex, changing locales, and plot twists that play with viewers' expectations, all the while keeping the laughs coming. It's not like ""North By Northwest"" invented this formula, but it perfected and distilled it into an essence that is imitated, with varying success, to this day.Cary Grant plays slick adman Roger Thornhill, who gets mistaken for a fugitive named Kaplan and finds himself on the run from a slew of bad guys, led by James Mason at his smug and oily peak as Vandamme. Martin Landau makes his first memorable appearance as Mason's nastiest henchman Leonard (1959 was good to him, as ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"" premiered that year as well), suspicious, ruthless, and probably gay. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it was 1959 and that was a little daring.Daring also is Eva Marie Saint's Eve Kendall, a woman who uses sex, as Thornhill puts it, ""the way some people use a flyswatter."" Her repartee with Thornhill shows just how erotic two people just talking to each other can be. It also provides further evidence Hitchcock's writers didn't go out on many dates. (Kendall: ""I'm a big girl."" Thornhill: ""Yeah, and in all the right places."" And she KISSES him for it!)The film does chug slowly at the outset, building suspense but also bugging you a bit as the plot gears grind while Thornhill is being pushed through his early paces, right until his moment at the UN. About the time we find ourselves with Thornhill in the cornfield, the picture starts to pick up a serious head of steam, and never loses it all the way to the final, famous tunnel shot. Actually, I like the penultimate scene between Grant and Saint, an elegant and witty way of resolving that most tried-and-true device, the cliffhanger.As with most of Hitchcock's 50s fare, elegance is behind much of what makes this movie so great. `North By Northwest' manifests an elegance in dress, decor, language, music, and lighting that represents the best of its era while giving the picture a timeless character all the same. Hitchcock's camera movements are very subtle yet brilliant, as during Mason's entrance and Grant's hide-and-seek game around the train. Everyone has perfect hair, lounges about in gowns and jackets, and you never think it should be otherwise.Grant isn't my favorite actor, but he's smooth enough for the central role when he's not doing that bad Foster Brooks impression behind the wheel of the car. [I docked the movie one point just for that.] His best scene may be at the auction, though he projects real fear in the cornfield. Saint is simply splendid, nailing every line as she walks a tightrope and plays her character's motives close to her décolletage. Hitchcock seemed to lose his ability to direct female actors, and not merely bask in them, with the advent of color, but Saint is one blonde bombshell that gives us a sense of brains and personality behind her mystery.There's logic gaps in this movie, and bad process shots, but it's an amazing ride all the same, more amazing because it's done with smoke and mirrors and without apologies. You ask the questions and figure out the loopholes only after you walk away, because the movie doesn't let you up much while you are watching it. Hitchcock made other, more challenging movies that attested to his rare vision as an artist, but this is maybe his purest exercise in the craft of good filmmaking. That's why `North By Northwest' has remained so high in people's estimations. Whatever the errors, it's hard not feeling good about that.",North by Northwest

An ordinary man in an extraordinary situation; the female character who is not all we think she is; even the ""McGuff"" turns up eventually.The film, from writer Ernst Lehman, follows the lean Cary Grant from one exciting tight spot to the next as he desperately tries to convince a bunch of would-be assassins that he is not a government agent. Grant is ideal for this average-joe role and he pulls it off well, almost having too much fun. Only Jimmy Stewart could do it better. Eva Marie Saint is reasonable as the femme fatale in question, while James Mason makes for a delicious villain. A young Martin Landau lends malevolent support as one of Mason's henchman.Photographer Robert Burks goes to town with several scenes, especially the brilliant Indiana bus stop showdown. And Mt.

One part vanity piece, one part spy thriller, ""North by Northwest"" has innocent Everyman Cary Grant on the run after being framed for a diplomat's murder; Eva Marie Saint is the femme fatale who may or may not be playing both sides; and James Mason is some sort of vaguely-defined heavy masterminding everything. Unlike Anthony Perkins in ""Psycho"" or Jon Finch in ""Frenzy,"" Grant is filled with too much winking, boyish charm to ever convey a sense of consequence for his character; Marie Saint is presented as more of a plot device than a character; and Mason brings a fair amount of class to his limited scenes.Maybe I was expecting something different, and therefore kept waiting for ""North by Northwest"" to turn into the tense, gripping thriller it has been hailed as. Ultimately, only a director with Hitchcock's pedigree could get away with a project so flagrantly self-indulgent and impossibly plotted and still earn a slew of sycophantic raves.

107,Steffi_P,"""Tease a man to death""",6,23 December 2010,"North by Northwest, among the best-known of all Hitchcock pictures, was in fact begun with the specific intention of creating (in the words of its writer Ernest Lehman) ""the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"". And to this end it does seem to tour faithfully round all the familiar stops on the Hitchcockian trail – the falsely accused man, the espionage backdrop the exact details of which are not elucidated, the showdown on a famous monument, the dry wit and the sharp innuendo. This may make it the most archetypal, but does it make it the best? One thing that really stands out about North by Northwest is that it is one of Hich's more comedy-laced scripts. Or more accurately, the comedy is more tightly interwoven, rather than being kept as a standalone feature for certain scenes or characters. And while there are some good laughs here, such as Cary Grant's nonchalant wisecracking when he is first kidnapped (which really makes us warm to the character), it seems to be at the expense of the action. You see, although there are certainly a lot of speedy chases, narrow escapes and cunning getaways, not a single one of them is up to Hitch's best standard. The drunk-driving chase for example is more awkward than nailbiting. There is simply no material for Hitchcock to do some grand orchestration of suspense, like say the concert hall scene from The Man Who Knew Too Much or the finales of Rear Window and Psycho. All in all this wrong-manhunt seems more like a case of annoyance rather than something to inspire the old ""it-could-happen-to-you"" fear factor.That is not to say there are not good things about North by Northwest. In fact there are plenty. Hitch's direction is on-the-ball as ever, with lots of set-ups where the characters are walking (or running) towards the camera, coupled with moving point-of-view shots, which places us somewhat forcibly within the action. This, coupled with a tight editing scheme, at least makes this 130-minute picture move at a considerable pace. Grant is perfectly suited to the resourceful but unassuming hero, and his laidback approach to comedy makes the most of the witty screenplay. It provides a great role for James Mason too, the suaveness and good looks that made him a desirable lead man in his youth now make him the perfect devilish villain in his middle age. Then there is the hard-hitting main theme by composer Bernard Hermann, the sparseness of which prefigures his stabbing strings for Psycho.However the fact remains that, while this may be very much the tailor-made Hitchcock classic, the finished product is more of a Hitchcock mediocrity. It lacks the sense of showmanship, the shock value and the spiralling tension that really made his finest pictures stand out.",North by Northwest

I was really disappointed with this , especially because it was a Alfred Hitchcock film. At times i was confused by the plot and at others i was just bored. Cary Grant's acting seemed wooden and the relationship with Eva Marie Saint was never convincing. The loves scenes were very cold and the 27 year age gap seemed very apparent. Plus points are that some of the scenes looked great , especially the aeroplane one and the performances of Mason and Landau are pretty good. Give me Psycho or Rear Window ahead of this any day.",North by Northwest
109,davidmvining,The Ultimate Hitchcock Film,10,11 August 2020,"Ernest Lehman, the writer of North by Northwest, set out to write the ""ultimate Alfred Hitchcock film,"" and I think he succeeded. This is probably the most Hitchcockian movie Alfred Hitchcock ever lensed, the summation of a career of obsessions and ideas into one film. It's his Fanny and Alexander except with Cary Grant, spies, and a chase over Mount Rushmore instead of a Swedish family dealing with their issues.Roger Thornhill is an advertising executive with two ex-wives and several bartenders dependent upon him who gets mistaken for a spy hot on the trail of a criminal, Phillip Vandamm who's stealing, let's say, government secrets. Like I said in my Foreign Correspondent review, the MacGuffin in this film is probably my favorite, being a vague ""government secrets"" that's so far outside the point of the action of the film as to be pretty much meaningless. The meaninglessness of the central plot device though allows the audience to focus far more on Thornhill himself along with Eve Kendall, an employee of Vandamm's who may have more to her than meets the eye.What sets this adventure apart from Hitchcock's previous outing with Cary Grant, To Catch a Thief, is that Grant has more than just his own charm to run the show. There's an actual story of a man trying to clear his name and the obstacles in his way instead of the man clearing his name being an excuse to spend time on the French Riviera. The antagonist is clear from the beginning, his motives for pursuing Thornhill made clear as well. The case of mistaken identity comes up out of coincidence and drives on because of how characters see the world and those around them. Thornhill's continued insistence that he's not George Kaplan, government spy, just convince Vandamm all the more that he is the spy because his disavowals sound so unconvincing to a man expecting someone more attuned to the lies of the spy game than honesty.The other third of this triangle is Eve Kendall, Vandamm's mistress. She and Thornhill have an easy rapport, as one might expect from a pairing where half is Cary Grant in an Alfred Hitchcock film, and the attraction is palpable, but she keeps him at arm's length. She's playing a complicated game already as the government's mole inside Vandamm's organization, and the sudden appearance of the spy Vandamm's been looking for but who keeps insisting that he's not the spy complicates her situation. The balance that ends up playing out as Thornhill eventually takes up the mantle of Kaplan. It ends up being a rather plot heavy affair, but what makes it work is really the focus on the two characters at the core of the struggle against Vandamm.Thornhill as the innocent wrong man who becomes part of the game, wonderfully played by Cary Grant, carries the audience through the adventure with charm and humor. His cynical handling of the situation as an effort to cover for his own bewilderment and fear is both a humorous and fun window into the action for the audience, but because Grant plays it as a cover for fear, it never disassociates from the action at hand to become fourth wall breaking material. The audience's perception of Eve helps as well as she moves from innocent bystander to nefarious double crosser to an earnest woman both caught up in events and an eager participant on the side of the good guys. Both are sympathetic protagonists and great anchors for the audience.And the adventure that surrounds those characters is really just all kinds of fun in big ridiculous ways. Every major set piece of this film is really famous for a reason. The crop duster scene builds so perfectly as Thornhill steps out of the bus into the middle of nowhere and we watch as the scene quietly develop. Each car is supposed to be his contact, and each car simply drives on by, all the while the plane flies around in the background, the quiet of the scene building tension as we wait for something to happen before the crop duster turns on Thornhill and starts its run.The scene atop Mount Rushmore is great as well with clear action about where every actor is as Thornhill and Eve try to escape Vandamm's henchmen, climbing down the faces of the presidents in an effort to find safety. It's ridiculous, but just so well executed that it's purely fun to watch.The production is completely first rate with huge sets, wonderful uses of matte paintings, and a great array of locations. The music by Bernard Hermann is propulsive and energetic, helping to push along the narrative. It's bright and colorful and the most purely fun movie Hitchcock had made since The 39 Steps.",North by Northwest
110,Spleen,"I rank it as Hitchcock's 19th best, myself",7,6 August 2000,"Let's get one thing straight: this film is tremendous fun.  Don't lose sight of this fact because of anything I say.  It's fun ALL THE WAY THROUGH, even when it creaks.  Moreover I can see some of the things that lead people to the ridiculous conclusion that it's a masterpiece.  Several scenes are classics in miniature - I can't really say which ones, but I suppose you already know about the crop duster sequence - then there's the priceless line Cary Grant delivers as he runs to the aeroplane on the slopes of Mt. Rushmore, so carefully led up to - and Bernard Herrmann's score is brilliant.And yet ...That damned Eve Kendall: SHE'S the McGuffin, not the ""government secrets"" the baddies are trying to smuggle out of the country.  (Clearly the film wants us to think she's so much more important than they are; but if it refuses to tell us what the villains want and why, how are we in any position to make a comparison?  Hitchcock's McGuffin theory led him astray here, I fear.)  The heroine of ""North by Northwest"" can't hold a candle to her vibrant counterpart in the original cross-country Hitchcock, ""The 39 Steps"" (1935).  Watch the original to see what's missing from the remake. The later film has a tendency, just a tendency, to fall asleep on its feet: it needed more poetry in its quest, more humanity in its hero, more vigour in its man hunt, less tedium in its exposition.  If I didn't know better - if I hadn't seen ""Vertigo"", released the previous year, or ""Psycho"", from the subsequent one - I'd say Hitch had ossified.",North by Northwest
111,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,North by Northwest (1959),10,14 December 2011,"A film that surprises me every time I see it. This will constantly be one of my favorite films as it is a constant barrage of hits. The film perfectly matches screwball comedy, raunchy romance (without ever getting too sexy), action, and mysterious suspense. A trick in recent films is to confuse the audience until the very end, where needless exposition happens. Hitchcock was a master of mysteries because he knew how many unanswered questions to have on the go at any one time, and when to answer them. As the film progresses, new plot twists arrive, making it an interesting and intriguing film. At the beginning, we are as clueless as Grant, but as the film goes on, we see more and more , gradually making us more informed than Grant. This clever respect for the audience means we are never talked down to. The action scenes are as fantastic today as they ever were. The slow build up to the plane scene is the kind of patience lacking in today's shaky cam world. North by Northwest is a perfect movie.",North by Northwest
112,Seraphion,Quite entertaining although not that solidly built,6,30 June 2014,"The story's basic premise is quite nice, especially for the era of the 1960s. It has since seen many other movie productions using the similar basic premise of ordinary people being mistaken as spies. The screenplay development isn't really that good, though, considering there's too much talk compared to significant spies work or fugitive hunting or avoiding capture, which what the movie is perceived to be offering. The technical things rather annoy me, like there is a strange and imbalanced lighting all over the movie, and the user of too much backdrop for background video. Yes those are maybe tolerable for those era, but for the later times like such as now, they seem quite stupid. The acting is quite nice, the actors try their best not too overact the scenes, yet they still do in a greater part of the movie.",North by Northwest
113,Movie-ManDan,The Greatest Mystery/Thriller Of All Time.,10,30 October 2014,"Alfred Hitchcock's speciality is thrillers. Some are straight thrillers, some conjoin with romances, horror, this conjoins with mystery. Hitchcock has combined these two, but has never done a better and more exciting film. Nobody has ever or will ever do a better, more exciting film. Having said that, is this better than, say, Vertigo or Psycho? Arguably. But Vertigo is a romance/thriller, Psycho is a horror/thriller and NBNW is a mystery/thriller. This does surpass other movies of its kind like Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon. The general story is a classic case of mistaken identity where a complex, top-secret government plan is under wraps. The movie grabs you by your collar the in the first two minutes and never lets go as the thrills and curves never stop coming at you full force. The main character (Cary Grant) careens to different ends of America as he must keep up with the game of cat-and-mouse he dies to get out of. Unlike Rear Window and The Maltese Flacon, NBNW features chase and danger sequences that add more excitement to its already mammoth exhilarating plot. Screw running, screw the gym. This movie can get your heart rate going in a much more enjoyable way.",North by Northwest
114,Galina_movie_fan,"""The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose""",10,7 March 2007,"Alfred Hitchcock knew a recipe for a perfect thriller because he had made many but among his films, ""North by Northwest"" (1959) stands out as a great combination of suspense, sex, and humor. The film is based on a case of mistaken identity that in a course of a few days makes a likable (even if slightly arrogant) Manhattan ad-man Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) the object of a cross country spy hunt. Having no clue what is happening to him, Thornhill will be kidnapped by the spies, brought to an unknown mansion and after the questioning forced to get drunk. He will get arrested for a stealing a car and drunk driving of which he has no recollection. It is just the beginning. Next, he finds himself in the UN building talking to a man who drops dead in the middle of the conversation in front of hundreds of people. The worst part  the man is murdered and Thornhill has the murder weapon, the knife in his hand. Both, the police and the spies are on his trail and his only hope is to escape NYC by train where a very sexy blonde named Eve (Eva Marie Saint) is ready to help him. Their encounter leads to one of the sexiest scenes ever filmed without any sexual act involved.The film is packed with the witty and funny dialogs and one- liners as well as with artful and imaginative set pieces including Grant running for his life across the prairie from an evil crop-duster and the climatic chase on Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock who always wanted to make a film with two scenes  a chase on the face of a president and the attempt to wake up the Peru Ambassador during the assembly in UN who turned to be dead, had his dreams fulfilled with ""North by Northwest"" which he suggested should be called ""The Man Who Sneezed in Lincoln's Nose"". Among many of film's pleasures are Eva Marie Saint as sexy stranger on a train and James Mason and young Martin Landau as a duet of villains with a complicated relationship.",North by Northwest
115,nycritic,What an Action Thriller Should Be.,10,11 April 2005,"VERTIGO did nothing to advance Hitchcock's career in 1957 when he released it, and it's actually not a shame: the following year he decided to go completely against the slow-moving erotic thriller genre and do something shamelessly commercial, escapist and single-handedly create the spy movie. Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels, states he based his character on the physical characteristics and the suave personality of Cary Grant, as an added note. This could well amount to be the first James Bond film -- a dangerous villain complete with a sidekick, an alluring woman with a dubious nature and an enigmatic ""boss,"" a dashing hero, lush locales setting the scene for powerful chases and escalating danger.NORTH BY NORTHWEST has one crucial difference to any James Bond film, though: Alfred Hitchcock. While the Bond films have been seen as quintessential action fluff (although fluff of the better kind until the franchise ran out of gas in the 80s), Hitchcock, always the master of subtext as well as suspense, creates memorable scenes that balance sexual tension, sexual innuendo, comedy, and mounting suspense seamlessly. There is never the feeling of being bored as there is too much going on, especially with the sizzling chemistry of Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant, by now a Hitchcock veteran. When they're on screen, dialog crackles and so much more is said with so little gesture -- she closes the lid on her Ice Goddess role, but gives it a nice, cheeky, knowing wink. He of course evolves from the sort of man who while looking and being slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb -- once it becomes clear he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot that only later becomes clear -- becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands. A quintessential Hitchcock Everyman, Grant has his stamp all over his role. No one can imagine anyone else running away from that crop duster in one of the movies many standout sequences, or saying the reassuring last words to Eva Marie Saint as they cuddle together in the train. When one thinks of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, one thinks Cary Grant.Easily one of Hitchcock's best films, made while he was at the peak of his career in the bracket formed with THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and MARNIE. Great supporting performances are all over the map, from Jesse Royce Landis as Grant's mother, James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, Martin Landau as Vandamm's protégée who might be a little more than that, and Leo G Carroll as The Professor. Doreen Lang appears early in the movie as Grant's secretary; she would of course be remembered as the woman who shrieks at Tippi Hedren in THE BIRDS and gets slapped by her as the camera holds itself tight on her face.",North by Northwest
116,Kingslaay,One of Cinemas finest films,8,20 January 2020,Alfred Hitchcock's is at the height of his powers in this fine classic. North by Northwest is easily one of the best movies ever made. Carey Grant is charismatic and brings his troubled character to life in this adventure. Viewers are taken on a great journey of mistaken identity and truth. This is a creative masterpiece on the screen and you are captured from start to finish. Never mind the technology and effects which look dated this film and quality stands the test of time.North by Northwest has echoes of the iconic James Bond franchise.

117,eric262003,A Grim Tale of Mistaken Identity,9,6 April 2015,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive for a magazine is socializing with his colleagues at the well-renown Plaza Hotel only to be interrupted when by a pageboy wanting a person by the name of George Kaplan. Thornhill eventually gets abducted by two henchmen named Valerian (Adam Williams) and his associate Licht (Robert Ellenstein). They believe that Roger is George Kaplan who is believed to be a secret agent who's trying to stop them from smuggling microfilm which holds to key to various government secrets. Trying to hang on to dear life all the while to clear his innocence, Thornhill goes on an all-over America quest to find the real George Kaplan who's much more harder to find than he could imagine. He eventually gets seduced by a voluptuous diva named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) as he tries to get away at the cost of being betrayed. It turns out that Miss Kendall is a double agent and Thornhill is an oblivious bystander. A dangerous chase comes his way which takes Thornhill across Mount Rushmore across the visages of the four iconic presidents. Even though Alfred Hitchcock directed this masterful film of thrill seeking espionage, he wasn't the only main reason this film was beyond remarkable. The very intellectual script by Ernest Lehman makes the dialogue just as equally poignant as the action. What is also a major milestone in the world of film-making comes from the opening title sequences by Saul Bass who for the first time used animated text to keep the viewers intrigued. For this movie like in all his movies, sadly Hitchcock was shut out at the Academy Awards for best direction, but had three nominations well deserved which included Best Script by Lehman, Best Editing by George Tomasini and Best Production Design. The trials and tribulation that our protagonist faces can really be hard at the nerves at times. I'm not a huge fan of seeing innocent people being framed for mistaken identity, but ""North by Northwest"" really exhibits this type of film almost flawlessly. From the opening scenes where he's picked up by these felons while eating with his colleagues and the more he struggles, the more our anxiety manifests within our psyche. And the fact that there is no George Kaplan, makes us more upsetting because know Thornhill can't even prove that he's not who they think he is. But the courageous thing about it is that Thornhill will not surrender that easily. The leading performances by Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint were absolutely stunning. Grant keeps the anguish going while trying to remain as collected as possible. EMS was able to take some risks by jumping hurdles that were pretty unknown at the time. This duo really carried the cargo of the film provocatively, but it took quite some moments before EMS entered the fray, but once she came into the scenes, the film really took off after. James Mason showed ferocity as the leading antagonist, but it was Martin Landau's Leonard that was even more macabre. His dialogue conveys just how homosexuality was treated during the golden age of cinema. Rounding out the smaller supporting roles is Leo G. Carroll who goes by the name of ""The Professor"" who concocted this whole Kaplan fiasco, but the more endearing moments are when Thornhill is interacting with his mother, Clara (Jessie Royce Landis who was just seven years older than him). The visuals were really out of this world. such memorable scenes includes the dazzling intoxicating car chase scene to the humorous elevator scene to the auction house scene and the climactic chase across Mount Rushmore.But the real eye-opener is when Thronhill is being chased by a crop duster, the shooting was some of the best ever delivered. For aficionados of the visual arts will truly enjoy this stylistic film. ""North By Northwest"" was vintage Hitchcock. The thrills will shock you, frustrate you all the while make your head spin in amazement. It comes with the man on the run, the double-crossing diva and the shady villain. It a vital movie for all Hitchcock impresarios and he would follow up with the even more eerie classic a year later with the iconic ""Psycho.""",North by Northwest
118,lewiskendell,The Popcorn Flick of Hitchcock Movies,7,7 June 2010,"North by Northwest reminds me of Vertigo more than any of the other Hitchcock movies that I've seen. Both of them are his versions of ""blockbusters"", with the pacing and action scenes of a good summer movie. I enjoyed both of them to about the same degree, as well. It's a pretty thrilling ride, I must say. A case of mistaken identity leads Cary Grant into a web of narrow escapes, murders, espionage, chases, and general peril. He meets the requisite icy blonde along the way (who may be friend or foe), and most of the other Hitchcockian flourishes are present in some degree. North by Northwest is also pretty damn funny. I laughed more than a few times at Grant's pithy quips and his mutually aggressive banter with Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall. Who just happens also be another gorgeous woman in a leading Hitchcock role. Who could have guessed?      This is a pretty good movie for anyone unfamiliar with Alfred Hitchcock to start with. It's entertaining enough in traditional ways that it will appeal to people who may have yet to become addicted to Hitchcock's style. I say ""yet"", because North by Northwest will probably speed you on your way to becoming hooked.",North by Northwest
119,screenman,Classic Hitchcock,8,6 November 2010,"'North By Northwest' opens as angularly-presented credits merge slickly into the facade of a modern office-block. The work sets a trend for Alfred Hitchcock's quirky and original thriller.Cary Grant plays a perfectly normal, urbane (gosh; you can say that again) businessman who is mistaken for someone else. And if that isn't trouble enough; the someone else doesn't actually exist. He's a fictional front created by the secret service. But they've done such a good job that nothing this schmuck can say will convince the bad guys that he is who he claims to be, and not this mysterious nobody.Hitchcock leads us through a wonderfully convoluted and suspenseful plot. Our hero survives his kidnap and attempted murder. He becomes a suspected murderer himself, and is pursued by authorities and traitors alike.Eva Marie Saint plays an American agent femme-fatale (she's the sort of pretty blonde that Hitchcock couldn't keep his hands off). James Mason plays the master criminal with coldly-confident aplomb, whilst Martin Landau plays his sidekick with more than a hint of homosexual jealousy. Set pieces and locations are extremely imaginative, especially the showdown at Mount Rushmore. There is also a wonderfully unconventional house. And, of course, there's the crop-dusting plane.I may be out of tune with popular opinion here, but if there is a single bum note in the whole movie it is the star himself. I have never understood the appeal of Cary Grant. His oleaginous features and strange whining voice seem completely unsuited to the role of action man. Frankly, I can't think of a less suitable choice. Gregory Peck would have given an equally suave turn whilst bringing some much-needed gravitas to the role. It is hard to imagine Grant not having a glass of bourbon in his hand throughout the movie.Still a great - if dated - watch, but spoilt by the limp-wristed urbanity of its over-hyped star.",North by Northwest
120,mike48128,"Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint ""own"" this movie",9,22 February 2014,"A playful if not implausible story of mistaken identity, espionage, and romance. One of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and far easier to watch than ""Psycho"" or the nightmarish ""The Birds"". Both actors are in great shape for their roles, although Eva hardly looks as young as the 26-year-old temptress she portrays. The violence is quite restrained here and it's more of a chase movie than a bloody thriller. The plot is celebrated: a suave and sophisticated advertising man is mistaken for the fictional spy ""George Kaplan"" by a smuggling ring headed up by Philip Van Damm (James Mason). Whether Kaplan is supposed to be FBI or CIA is never quite explained by ""The Professor"" played by Leo G. Caroll in one of his best movie roles ever. (His worst: The mad scientist in ""Tarantula""). Cary Grant's character almost dies by several playful methods: driving a runaway sports car off a cliff after Bourbon is poured down his throat, shot at by a machine gun from a crop dusting airplane, and falling off the side of Mount Rushmore. Eva's character as a ""kept woman"" and secret agent is not quite plausible but she is so ""hot"" it doesn't really matter. The Bernard Hermann musical score is outstanding. The Chinese idol concealing the microfilm is a thinly-disguised plot-devise borrowed from ""The Maltese Falcon"" and certainly not an original idea. Also, when Jame Mason falls to his death on Mount Rushmore, it looks matted in. The title refers to both Northwest Airlines and the direction the chase takes from Chicago to South Dakota. The somewhat predictable ending on the ""20th Century Limited"" is humorously punctuated by the train going into a dark tunnel, as Cary and Eve finally get together, for perhaps the 2nd time, in the finale. Most enjoyable to watch and beautifully photographed. Both the forest and Mt. Rushmore are, at times, movie sets!

125,sme_no_densetsu,An enjoyable thriller,8,23 July 2008,"In Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" an advertising executive (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a non-existent government agent and is forced to go on the run following a botched murder and subsequent framing. Along the way he meets an alluring stranger (Eva Marie Saint) but it remains to be seen whether she is friend or foe.I wasn't bowled over by the storyline, which is pretty standard thriller material. Of course, I'm not much of a fan of thrillers in the first place so you can take my lack of enthusiasm with a grain of salt. Still, it cannot be denied that the plot has several similarities with other, earlier Hitchcock films, making this a sort of 'definitive' Hitchcock film.The cast is solid with Grant & Saint ably handling the lead roles though it is James Mason as the suave, villainous Phillip Vandamm who gives the most memorable performance. Martin Landau, as Vandamm's right-hand man, is also notable though his role is a minor one. There was one odd bit of casting, though; that of Mrs. Thornhill, who appears to be about the same age as her son. Surely casting could have found someone more appropriate.Unsurprisingly, the direction is top-notch and there's also a tense Bernard Herrmann score to augment the action. I was surprised that the tone of the film was so sexually suggestive and I grinned when I recognized the connotation of the film's final shot. Sure, it's tame by today's standards but it all seems slightly risqué for '59.In my opinion this is an enjoyable film though I'm not sure that I'd label it as one of the greats of all time.

It all starts from mistaken identity, then warps into a cloak and dagger intrigue.

127,pyrocitor,"""What does the 'O' stand for?"" ""Nothing.""",10,20 November 2009,"By 1959, Alfred Hitchcock's star as a director had been monumentally starting to rise, propelling him past the point of respectable craftsman or even serious artist, to the point of recognition as an industry celebrity. However, contrary to the stereotype of the artist resisting the trappings of celebrity, this star image was one Hitchcock voluntarily, even consciously bought into, playing up his larger than life image of the 'master of suspense', particularly in his show, ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", complete with his own recognizable theme song. As such, it would appear that the collection of tropes, whether thematic trends, technical similarities or recurring narrative and character types now characterized as a ""Hitchcock film"" were hardly accidental, a theory for which North by Northwest proves a perfect example. Largely recognized as one of Hitchcock's most fun and least serious outings, North by Northwest can be retrospectively seen as an attempt by Hitchcock to make, in many ways, the definitive ""Alfred Hitchcock"" film, intentionally encapsulating and often playing up many of the defining elements of his past films into a single, hugely enjoyable narrative. Much of what makes the film so downright fun is its synthesis between the straightforward and the cheekily tongue-in-cheek. While, if functioning as a standalone narrative, the film could easily accomplish its task of delivering a breathless, enthralling spy thriller and mystery, the real fun is to be found in recognizing how consciously and unashamedly cinematic the whole ordeal is. The plot appears tailored to intentionally deliver the maximum quantity of thrills, laughs, edginess (notice the sensors being tested in the uncommonly explicit exchange of sexual dialogue between Grant and Marie Saint on the train) suspense and memorable set pieces (especially one involving a crop duster which viewers just may have heard of), demonstrating Hitchcock's effortless command of the cinematic form and potential to warp it towards any given motivation. As such, the entire film effectively functions as its own ""MacGuffin"", in the end, signifying, like the 'O' in Thornhill's name, ""nothing"" - a film existing just for the sake of being a film, for showing how masterfully crafted, carefully constructed and downright entertaining cinema can be. Even the film's title was allegedly chosen as a place holder, simply because it sounded catchy, and finally kept since no one could think of a better one, with no deeper significance. This is not to say that no narrative or thematic complexity can be read within the film, but rather than it intertwines itself with this notion of willfully cultivated escapism. The most pervasive theme is the self-reflexive notion of construction - just as the plot is consciously constructed with the intent of epitomizing the heroic and spy myths, as well as Hitchcock's ever familiar 'wrong man' theme (his inclusion of Thornhill's mother, who fulfils virtually no function within the plot can also be seen as a dig at his own recurring domineering mother figures within his body of work), his film continually engages with notions of characters constructing identities and, in turn, having new identities forged for them. As Grant's Thornhill remarks, he is continually being thrust into a series of performances or roles, some deliberate, most enforced unwillingly upon him, and is only ever taken seriously by other characters in the narrative when he buys into playing up such imposed performances. However, it is also intriguing to note the series of facades and constructed identities other characters within the film assume, with many far less apparent than it would initially seem, demonstrating webs of construction within construction which ultimately add far more nuance and poignant thematic issues to the film than it is commonly given credit for. However, the film also unquestionably functions as an independent narrative, and a stunningly constructed one, both technically and emotionally. While setpieces such as the crop duster sequence and the finale on Mount Rushmore may be the ones to (justifiably) work their way into the collective unconscious, it would take close attention paid to the smaller, less obtrusive moments in the film (Thornhill's subtle manipulation of his being continually thrust into the spotlight to save himself, the effortless, rapid fire and often hilariously self-aware nature of the vibrant script) which truly demonstrate Hitchcock's impeccable command of cinematography, editing, pacing and sound (notice the pitch- perfect alternating use of utter silence or Bernard Herrmann's timeless, triumphant musical score). Willfully superficial or not, the film truly demonstrates the power of the cinematic form to arouse sensation and genuine emotional response in the viewer, delivering a peerlessly enjoyable hybrid of thrills and humour.Of course, as Hitchcock realized, none but Cary Grant (the master of his own constructed star persona) could have properly essayed the role of Roger 'O' Thornhill, as Grant's unquenchable charisma, astute comic timing and genuine presence keep the viewer firmly rooting for Thornhill through adversity after adversity, making each normally unbelievable character trait or ambitious line of dialogue somehow ring with endearing, charming credibility. Eva Marie Saint makes for the definitively ambiguous femme fatale figure, excelling both at devious betrayal and genuine, raw emotion, making the chemistry between the two stars exquisitely believable and crackling with truly dynamic energy. The similarly self-reflexive casting of James Mason as the antagonist (characters in Hitchcock's earlier Rope had discussed how Mason would make an excellent villain) proves entirely justified, as his sneering, oily, perpetually composed Philip Vandamm makes for a deliciously deplorable yet oddly charming foe to boo and hiss at. Finally, character actor Martin Landau deserves considerable plaudits for redeeming the role of the evil henchmen to a genuinely intriguing, confusing and viscerally frightening figure, and Jessie Royce Landis is a welcomely comical presence as Thornhill's scathing, society woman mother. Whether taken as self-reflexive, satirical dig at his own stereotypes or an impeccably thrilling romp on its own right, Hitchcock's North by Northwest unquestionably holds up as a timeless classic of cinema, and essential viewing for all who have yet to experience it. -10/10",North by Northwest
128,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good thriller,6,15 September 2008,"The addition of pretense can be a killer in a film. It is precisely the lack of such a quality that makes Alfred Hitchcock's two and a quarter hour long 1959 color thriller North By Northwest a better and more enjoyable film than his preceding film, Vertigo, even if the film comes nowhere near the excellence of his following film, Psycho. Whereas the two films that end in o attempt to impose a deeper psychology into their screenplays, North By Northwest is a popcorn eaters gala pre-James Bondian Cold War thriller. It's no wonder the film was a popular smash while Vertigo was a financial flop.On a strictly logical level, little of the film makes much sense, but it's Hitchcock, after all. As example, what is contained on the microfilm that is the film's MacGuffin- inside the statuette, is meaningless and beside the point- which is action and thrills. That there is no logical reason for Cary Grant's character, Roger Thornhill- another Hitchcockian wrongly accused man, a Madison Avenue advertising executive, to be mistaken for the non-existent spy George Kaplan, is another problem. Yet, even though it is done in a rather unconvincing fashion- Thornhill summons a hotel attendant who is paging Kaplan, and the chase is on- few people will debate cause and effect in a film like this. The dopey bad guys see this brief moment and assume everything- a perfect example of the dumbest possible action propelling the plot, which is usually an artistic killer. However, on the plus side, this is one of Cary Grant's best and Cary Grantiest roles. He is charming, delightful, suave, and the fact that he never seems to get a hair out of place in assorted acts of derring-do, even when chased and dusted by that crop duster, in one of the film's most famed scenes, is not a problem, unless one just cannot let the formula silliness wash over them.On the negative side is the performance of Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall- the lover/counterspy of James Mason's Soviet mole character, Phillip Vandamm. Saint is stiff and wooden, and even less convincing as a romantic lead than many of the other icy blonds that inhabit the Hitchcock universe. Yes, she's beautiful; second perhaps only to Grace Kelly in the Hitchcockian blond goddess pantheon, but she has absolutely no chemistry with Grant. Technically, the film holds up much better than many of Hitchcock's other efforts, for the process screens are not always readily detectable, as they are in other of his films- save for the scene where Thornhill does not drive his car off a cliff that the bad guys want him to, and the sets constructed for some of the big chase scenes- especially the Mount Rushmore set, are fabulous, even by modern standards. While the cinematography by Robert Burks is solid, there are no eyepopping moments, and the score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his least memorable, especially considering what was just around the corner in Psycho.North By Northwest, whose title is both manifest- given the film's final setting, and obscure and of unknown provenance- although oddly linked to a supposed quote from William Shakespeare's Hamlet, is not a great film, but it is a terrific movie, and because it is such utter and unrepentant fluff it holds up much better than many other 1950s vintage films, including many of Hitchcock's own overrated 'masterpieces', such as Rear Window and Vertigo. Yes, if you are the type who must go over everything with even a coarse toothcomb, the film simply will not work, but if you trust that the fun will leave your mind as unmussed as Cary Grant's coiffure, then watch it. After all, the perfect hair of Cary Grant is never something to be diminished.",North by Northwest
129,seymourblack-1,A Real Crowd Pleaser,9,21 August 2010,"""North By Northwest"" is an exceptionally entertaining spy thriller with something for everyone. Its heady mixture of suspense, romance, humour and intrigue make it a real crowd pleaser and its action sequences are delivered at an exhilarating pace. The wonderful locations chosen for many of the scenes are stunning and add enormously to the visual impact of the whole movie and the original screenplay by Ernest Lehman is sophisticated and witty and contains numerous quotable lines.This is a movie which undoubtedly appeals to a broader section of the public than any of Alfred Hitchcock's other offerings and also features one of his favourite themes i.e. a man who's falsely accused of something and then finds that his life descends into chaos as a consequence. Its story of mistaken and shifting identities is particularly engaging to audiences as it depicts how an ordinary man copes in a number of extraordinary circumstances and how he manages in a number of very dangerous predicaments from which there often appears to be no way out.Cary Grant is superb as the suave, fast talking Roger Thornhill who's kidnapped, jailed, framed for murder and made the victim of a number of attempts on his life. His skills are so versatile that he's equally convincing whether he's involved in a dramatic scene, an action sequence, a comic episode or even the type of risqué dialogue that he indulges in with Eva Marie Saint's character.Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is an elegant looking woman who makes both Roger and Vandamm (James Mason) very suspicious of her and also on some occasions finds herself in extreme danger. Eva Marie Saint projects Eve's mixture of mystery, humour and vulnerability in precisely the right measure for each situation and in so doing provides a very creditable performance. James Mason is also great as the cultured but utterly ruthless Vandamm who has a marvellous capacity for remaining completely unruffled at all times.The opening title sequence by Saul Bass is strikingly original and makes a great impact as does the use of the various high profile locations (e.g. the United Nations HQ, the Plaza Hotel in New York, Grand Central Station and Mount Rushmore) which contribute so strongly to making certain parts of the movie so memorable and so enjoyable.",North by Northwest
130,Spuzzlightyear,Paging Mr. Kaplan Mr George Kaplan..,9,24 December 2005,"""North By Northwest"" is probably well.. many things! Probably the best mistaken identity film ever made, the film with the most exciting chase sequences (Man vs. plane!), the most awesome set pieces made (Mount Rushmore!) the funniest ""goof"" on screen (kid holding his ears when the gun goes off!) and probably my favorite Hitchcock movie ever. Cary Grant is just amazing in this totally insane plot of mild-mannered ad executive getting thrust into a ridiculous game of underworld espionage, where he's forced to run from planes, gets tied up in a drunk driving rap, is nearly run over by a semi AND has to fight off James Mason and Martin Landau! Ah well, if you're gunning for a blonde as smoking as Eva Marie-Saint, wouldn't you? A lot of this is so over the top to be taken totally seriously, and mostly it's just pure popcorn fun. And cinema doesn't get any better or snarkier then the auction scene. A must see, if you're foolish enough for not having seen it yet.",North by Northwest
131,bobsgrock,"War is hell, even if it is a cold one.",10,30 May 2009,"Although it is one of his most famous it may not be considered among his best, which I think it deserves to be. North by Northwest is more than a cross-country trip across America to solve a case of mistaken identity, it is also a send-up of all the old detective and spy movies Hollywood made in the 1930s and 1940s. What Hitchcock has done here is take a similar premise from one of his earlier films, Saboteur, and create a funny, intelligent and wonderfully entertaining story filled with great visuals and one-liners.Cary Grant gives perhaps his best role for Hitchcock in his last as Roger Thornhill, a man caught up in the web of espionage and deceit as he tries to convince a group of men that he is not George Kaplan. Eva Marie Saint is quite a saint as the beautiful and tough Eve Kendall. Perhaps the true reason to this great success is due to Ernest Lehman's fully entertaining script that has many tart one-liners as well as enough twists to screw up even M. Night Shyamalan. Of course, Hitchcock was at the top of his game here, working between his two greatest pictures, Vertigo and Psycho. Here, he is just having fun, playing with us as we try to follow all the action and suspense. Truly, this could be considered a prelude to all those other action movies made today. Some are good, most are pathetic, but Hitchcock pointed the way and it is a path worth going down again and again.",North by Northwest
132,Jeremy_Urquhart,Very entertaining,8,23 April 2020,"A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and is pursued across the country while he looks for a way to survive.Quite reminiscent of Hitchcock's own The 39 Steps, though this one's on a much greater scale. It's a bit of a messy film, and maybe also a tad formulaic, but it's a lot of fun to watch, and is probably one of Hitchcock's most entertaining movies. Worth watching for the crop-duster scene alone, which may well be one of the greatest scenes in motion picture history- absolutely brilliant tension-building and visual effects, and maybe my favourite scene from any Hitchcock film on this list. 8/10",North by Northwest
133,TheUnknown837-1,"everything you want from Alfred Hitchcock, you're going to get it in ""North by Northwest""",9,6 August 2009,"After completing his psychological masterwork ""Vertigo"" in 1958, the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock decided it was time to turn back and make another high-energy, less thought-evoking thrill ride but still, at the same time, incorporate all of his favorite trademark film characteristics like he had done with ""Rear Window"" in 1954. ""North by Northwest"" was the result of his new initiative. This is a genuinely entertaining Saturday matinée thriller that shows that Hitchcock could be produce something that was pure and simple fun through his mastery.""North by Northwest"" stars Cary Grant, one of Hitchcock's most famous leading men, as a stuck-up New York advertising executive who is mistaken for a notorious government agent by a command of foreign spies led by James Mason. When he manages to escape their capture the first time (along with his own death), Grant goes on the run when they frame him for murder and he encounters many obstacles including a machine gun-toting biplane, misinformed police officers, and an icy, cool blond played memorably by Eva Marie Saint.Alfred Hitchcock liked to reuse the trademark plot elements and themes from his most successful films in hopes of repeating success at the box office and in ""North by Northwest"", he brings virtually all of them together again as he had done in ""Vertigo"" a year before: mistaken identity, an innocent man thrown into an unknown situation, treachery and the consequences of treachery, false accusations, and so forth. Although Hitchcock's aim was to do something on the opposite side of the psychological field from ""Vertigo"", he ended up producing what could be ""Vertigo"" if it was an action-comedy.Everything people want and expect from Hitchcock, they're going to get it. Hitchcock was not only a master at generating suspense and mystery, but he was a master of storytelling as well. The idea of a civilian mistaken for a government agent has been used many times before and after ""North by Northwest"", but Hitchcock does it with such primal energy and such style and enthusiasm that his film is really the landmark in the genre. Who can forget, just to list one example, Cary Grant running across a desolate field from the biplane that had been ""dustin' crops where there ain't no crops""? Hitchcock had at first been planning on using his previous leading man, James Stewart, again for ""North by Northwest"" and there are conflicting stories as to why Stewart was not given the role. Some say Hitchcock felt Stewart was too old to keep an audience interested anymore. Others say Stewart was already tied in with filming Otto Preminger's masterful courtroom drama ""Anatomy of a Murder"" (1959). Whatever the case, as wonderful an actor James Stewart was and as fantastic a job he would have done (to put it mildly), this was the sort of film that was meant for and should have been done by Cary Grant. The role of Roger O. Thornhill was meant for him like Charles Foster Kane was meant for Orson Welles and Norman Bates for Anthony Perkins. Even at fifty-five, Grant is very charismatic and charming and competent as the New Yorker on the run from enemies he does not understand in a situation he does not understand. The studio had also wanted Hitchcock to cast Sophia Loren as the icy cold leading lady, but this was most certainly the vehicle for recent Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint, who is seductive and sometimes cold in the role of the woman Grant also cannot understand. And the casting of James Mason as the antagonist is not only a wise choice, but ironic, as eleven years before in Hitchcock's experimental film, ""Rope"", three characters had listed James Mason as a great villainous actor.And of course, we have Hitchcock controlling everybody and everything as he always did. He makes his usual cameo appearance very early in the movie (probably because he was tired of people scanning the screen for him throughout the entire running time instead of watching the movie). And in regards to creating energy, raising questions, and of course, generating suspense, he does not fail. Now, the climax for the film did not quite ring my bell, but that's a very minor complaint. Hitchcock was one of the two or three best filmmakers who ever lived and this is one of his most entertaining works. Everything you want from Alfred Hitchcock, you're going to get it in ""North by Northwest.""",North by Northwest
134,kevin c,BEST FILM IN THE WORLD (WHEN YOU'RE POORLY),8,26 January 2004,"There is a tradition in my house that if I'm poorly I always watch this film. It recaptures the spirit of Hitchcock's 1930 British adventures, and is the best adventure tale in cinematic history.  Nobody is cooler on the screen than Grant, and Mason runs him close with a sense of humour to boot.",North by Northwest
135,brchthethird,A thrilling action/adventure whose reach somewhat exceeds its grasp,9,10 August 2015,"While not quite Hitchcock's best, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is nevertheless one of his most thrilling, and funny, motion pictures. It stars Cary Grant as an ad executive who gets mistaken for a government agent and has to go on the run in order to survive. Sound familiar? That's because the plot is kind of similar to Hitchcock's own SABOTEUR and THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (although you can be certain that Cary Grant's character didn't; the bad guys just think he does). This simple premise provided for a myriad of exciting set-pieces that exemplify the kind of suspense-building and thrills that Hitch's audience were most certainly used to by this point in his career. Cary Grant is quite a good replacement for the everyman character that James Stewart played so well, and Eva Marie Saint plays a nice twist on the femme fatale as this film's Hitchcock blonde. Still, what struck me so much was how funny this film was. At certain points, it was like watching a comedy of errors combined with a spy thriller. There was also a lot more obvious sexual innuendo than in any Hitchcock picture I've seen before. Signs of the changing times, maybe? Moving on, even though it wasn't as tightly written as some of Hitchcock's other films, being essentially a bunch of action set-pieces strung together, it was still rather inventive and the momentum was kept going at a pretty good pace throughout. In particular, the crop-dusting scene and the climactic sequence on Mount Rushmore stand out from the rest, as I'm sure they do to many others who've seen the film. However, what made this not quite as perfect as could have been has a lot do with Hitchcock's tendency to do a lot of shooting on sound stages. As a result, a car chase that takes place early on (with a drunk Cary Grant) was less thrilling and believable than it could have been, and Bernard Herrmann's score had to compensate (a little too much, perhaps). And, the villains this time around weren't as memorable, mostly because we don't really see them do anything villainous. Still, James Mason was a pleasure to watch, and we get to see Martin Landau play a heavy. Overall, I do think this is better than the previous Hitchcock films I mentioned, if for no other reason than that there's more of what worked in those films. Still, at 136 minutes, it is a little too long and, like many other of Hitchcock's movies I've seen, the ending was too abrupt and a little bit of a cheat. So, while its reach does somewhat exceed its grasp in terms of the action, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is still a suitably thrilling action/adventure that ranks among the most entertaining that Hitchcock ever made.",North by Northwest
136,gizmomogwai,Joining Hitchcock's fan club,10,25 March 2010,"Until a couple years ago I didn't see what the big deal was with British/American director Alfred Hitchcock. I had seen his '60s movies Psycho and The Birds and thought they were overrated. However, my curiosity was sparked when the American Film Institute put Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) in its top ten American movies of all time. Having seen it and more recently Rear Window and North by Northwest (also on AFI's list), I can say I now see why Hitchcock is considered one of the greats.North by Northwest is about spies and the Cold War, and for this reason has been compared to the later James Bond movies. Yet this movie still feels like it was made for Hitchcock- the suspense, the mystery, the thrills and murder are all here. There's also some humour thrown in for good measure. This movie centres around a case of mistaken identity as an ordinary guy (he says at the end of the movie that his wives divorced him because he was dull) finds himself in a dangerous game. There's also a woman he meets. Critic Danny Peary is quoted on the DVD back cover as saying there's ""a great deal of sex,"" but really there's none, just sexual innuendo. Still, it enriches the plot. With generally believable dialogue and acting, North by Northwest is a winner.",North by Northwest
137,hnt_dnl,A deliriously entertaining masterwork,10,15 March 2008,"Alfred Hitchcock was a certified genius of a filmmaker. He could scare you, shock you, surprise you, enthrall you, make you think, make you smile, make you laugh, and all the while making you a part and parcel of the storytelling and action in his film. His goal was always to make the audience a part of the action and take them along for the ride. He may do this to absolute perfection in this film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, my absolute favorite film of his. It's debatable whether or not this is his greatest film. A lot of so-called film 'critics' will swear by VERTIGO(although I'm not crazy about it), some say PSYCHO, others say NOTORIOUS, some prefer SHADOW OF A DOUBT, others REBECCA. Who knows? I just know that NORTHW BY NORTHWEST, without a doubt, is the most thoroughly enjoyable, fun, fascinating, entertaining, and eye-popping film that Hitchcock ever did. I love every frame of it. The first 30 minutes alone is more captivating, exciting and entertaining than 99.9% of the crap they throw at us nowadays in the movies.Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, a normal, run-of-the-mill advertising agency executive. Grant deserves all praise of being the legend that he truly was for what he does in this film. Grant's Roger Thornhill is one of 'us', a fairly regular everyday Joe who gets thrust in the most convoluted of situations: mistaken for a government agent named 'Kaplan' by treacherous U.S. enemies (led by the classy James Mason), Thornhill is whisked off captive one evening and his life is threatened and he is almost killed, but he thankfully escapes his captors and so the fun begins in finding out who these bad guys are and why they think he is Kaplan.The film has a kind of snowball effect. Each situation that Thornhill is thrown into or gets himself into is more dangerous than the previous one and he has to find some way to get himself out of it. Hitchcock almost seems to relish scaring the Bejesus out of this guy just to see how he will slick or cajole his way out of it. Thornhill is really an unwitting and unexpected pawn in the battle between U.S. agents and the enemy traitors. All the qualities that made Cary Grant a star shine through in this film: he is handsome, classy, witty, funny, sarcastic, and surprisingly agile. Whoever thought he could pull off being an action hero after all those years of playing primarily romantic comedies? But he totally gives a convincing performance in this film.Of course at some point we are introduced to the femme fatale, in this case Eva Marie Saint, who is super-sexy and mysterious in this role. Saint's character makes you realize why so many women found Cary Grant so charming and irresistible.The film has some of the most memorable sequences and set pieces ever in history: the United Nations murder, the Mount Rushmore finale, and most of all, that magnificent crop-dusting sequence smack dab in the middle of the film that forever captured the hearts, minds, and imaginations of moviegoers everywhere. The scene is all at once action-packed, scary, dangerous, exciting, and funny.For me, this Hitchcock film (first shown in 1959) can be seen as a very early example of a blockbuster summer action movie. It has all the elements: a colorful look and feel, lots of outdoor scenery, nonstop action, a breathtaking pace, and a central character through which the story is told and that we could all identify with and root for.Truly a great achievement by both Alfred Hitchcock and Cary Grant, with big-time assists from a great cast of supporting actors and actresses, a witty script, and the beautiful scenery of various U.S. locations.",North by Northwest
138,marcin_kukuczka,Stupendous Achievement and Highly Satisfactory Entertainment,9,21 May 2014,"Just after the title sequence designed by Saul Bass, the opening shots immediately bring to mind the hallmarks of the movie's director, the Master of Suspense whose stories memorably imprisoned the characters in a world of wit, suspense, drama, erotic overtones and highly manipulative emotions. Along with the Expressionist influence on his movies and certain bases created within the walls of Hollywood system, the director's highly sophisticated, unique style pursued within a span of a few decades but, foremost, his frankness towards viewers made Hitchcock stand a test of time. And with his ""sardonic, mischievous wit"" and the ""magnetism of his casts"" (Carter B. Horsley), including Ernest Lehmann's witty and clever script, NORTH BY NORTHWEST appears to be Hitchcosk's milestone and ""perhaps his most fully realized film."" (Charles Ramirez Berg). All seems to be around an old Hollywood saying: ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl after all."" And although this saying appears to find its resemblance within the themes of many movies, when supplied with Hitch's suspense, it results in stupendous achievement and a highly satisfactory entertainment.To start with, it appears that most of the movie's charm and strength lies in the lead performance by Cary Grant as a ""man on Lincoln's nose,"" likable Roger Thornhill. Unlike James Stewart, Cary Grant, the prototype of the ideal man and a man-bridge of generations at the turn of periods, supplies us with the most crucial aspects of good performance. He is wonderfully witty, outstandingly skilled, almost an athlete on the screen, a perfect leading man as well as the actor capable of bringing about the very best thrills and putting emotional resonance into the story. His performance is so powerful that we, as viewers, simply skip certain flaws in the story. He is never too much overwhelmed by the role, never too easily taken with emotions and by that his role remains one of the most authentic achievements on the screen. Being his fourth role under the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, he proves excellent rapport with the Master of Suspense. The director's sense of humor goes perfectly well with Grant's comic skills, the director's style goes well with Grant's mystique, the director's psychological overtones and hidden meanings go beautifully with the actor's subtle, transcending acting abilities. The best moments include the drunkard's driving (which B Horsley rightly labels as ""pure buffoonery"") and the art auction, a typical Hitch-like scene of a public event interrupted. No wonder Pauline Kael once pointed out that Grant ""appeared before us in his radiantly shallow perfection and that is all we wanted of him."" FEMALE CO-STARS: Hitchock's preferences of beautiful blonds on the screen does not meet any exception in NORTH BY NORTHWEST. It is no Grace Kelly or Ingrid Bergman, but an actress who can perfectly stand a chance against lots of expectations and requirements of the more demanding audiences, Eva Marie Saint as a 26 year-old Eve Kendall. She manages to give a performance that initiates a true clash of senses: radiantly awesome whilst being a stranger on a train so much taken with the man's face, stunningly captivating whilst being a spy within a more organized institutionalized group, undeniably sexy capable of bringing all erotic thoughts to life whilst being totally dressed. The best moments include the train sequence, in my opinion. That sequence brings all to heights of witty intelligence and a great touch of climbing up and proving to him why she has been so good to the man. The two (Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant) appear to embody contrast themselves, contradiction of loneliness vs togetherness. ""Boy gets girl after all and loneliness happily leads to togetherness...Among the supporting cast, each viewer will surely be stunned by the performance of James Mason, ""deliciously pernicious"" with ""cool elegance and authority"" (B. Horsley) drawing parallels to James Bond's villains. His scenes are ostentatiously cold and innately captivating. The theme of a mummy's boy is developed by Jessie Royce Landis who plays the protagonist's mother in some hilarious moments. Martin Landau is also interesting in his early role as Leonard.Amidst the merits of the movie, two points need a special mention: excellent shots that Alfred Hitchcock was famous for and the score by Bernard Herrman. It's no need to say how beautifully the tunes correspond to the action, the whole storytelling, how balanced the score is and how strongly it teases our imagination, our assumptions, gently caressing our senses. The shots reveal grandeur at Glen Cove estate but reach the pinnacle at Mount Rushmore sequence which has revealed much of the director's haunting flair for Expressionism. So much as the Golden Gate Bridge is a silent character of VERTIGO, Mt Rushmore serves that purpose in NORTH BY NORTHWEST, being even more...an unforgettable crescendo of the finale.While seeing NORTH BY NORTHWEST after a few decades, you have this unusual feeling that you are watching something unique, something that may still entertain you, enthrall you, touch you, amuse you and, foremost, bring all the thrill of suspense to a unique scale of perceptions. Charles Ramirez Berg put it nicely in his article highlighting Hitchock's legacy that ""this quintessential chase movie is full of the things for which we remember Alfred Hitchcockl..."" What are the things? No need to enumerate them, just see the film and find for yourself/yourselves.",North by Northwest
139,sharky_55,"I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.",9,19 April 2016,"North by Northwest's aesthetic is stylish yet anxious - the now iconic opening titles arrange the text in rigid, geometric lines splayed across the screen in 3d, and below, reflecting on the vast mirrors of skyscrapers, citizens milling and scuttling like an insect collective, bond by a single instinct to survive. The post-war modernity, the architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, the slick decor, the stylish fashion, all marred by the contextual Cold War paranoia. The leading man is thrust out of the masses into a plot of spiralling complexity and mystery, but of course he is no spy, but another everyman just trying to get by (and early on we have that overhead shot of the UN escape making him tiny like an ant). The film resolves to get more out of him; to fill that big, empty 'O' in the middle of his name and in short, be a man his mother would be proud of. The film's plot would be torn apart into shreds these days, but back then it was the spy thriller before 007, and Phillip Vandamm is the Bond villain before there were Bond villains. His closing of the shutters and atmospheric lamp is the spinning chair and stroking cat of the 60s. His villainy does not subscribe to subtlety, so we have the showy, evil monologue, where they circle each other like they were in a gladiatorial arena, and then the least inconspicuous way of murdering an enemy agent. For every dodgy rear projection car scene we have the crop duster, still a marvel to this day. The torched brown wheat-fields, the rural American icon, transformed into something of an expressionist nightmare taking its cues from the German movement; the geometric rigidity of the horizon, two tiny figures intersecting at perfect right angles, the undeviating rows of gold. The overhead wide shot betrays nothing - airplanes and buses materialise out of nowhere, and the mystery is only furthered. Nevertheless Hitchcock does veer in gratuitous territory every now and again. The appearance and lengthy seduction of Eva Marie Saint as a sort of crimson guardian angel is as risqué as they come, and Lehman can't help but pause the tension for few well directed one- liners and suggestive whispers. It is only empowered by later revelations that paint the scene in a new light as a jolt in her confined life. This theme comes together in a stunning reveal at the auction; it starts on the blonde back of Kendall's head, with Vandamm's hand caressing and wrapping around her like suffocating tendrils, then slowly pulls back to reveal the rest of the auction and lastly Thornhill's spurned glare. Hitchcock is channeling a similar vibe on obsession and possession as he did in Vertigo, and Kendall's blonde locks and red dress stick out disturbingly in the crowd. A masterful reveal with pure image, though I suppose it is slightly undercut by Grant's annoyance (rather than what we would expect and are shown, fury) and slapstick antics in messing with the bidding. Of course what Hitchcock really wanted to do was a climatic sequence atop Mount Rushmore. The final set was a giant replica of the famed carvings, and it holds up rather well, projecting a sense of depth from high up above down to the rocky cliffs below. The action staging is a little less exciting than a modern audience would have liked - Hitchcock had to cut from wide shots of the real site to closeups of the replica for the actual action, resulting in a rather stilted sequence of events where they are eventually rescued by the agency. And the way Grant struggles to pull Saint up from over a cliff, and how his desperation turns into a slight smile as the scene transitions forwards onto a train bed? Pure silliness and sentimental theatricality, but at least they are openly admitting it. We can't help but crack a grin as the train rushes into the tunnel.",North by Northwest

A chance encounter with Eve Kendell (Eva Marie Saint) points him in the right direction, but before too long he begins to wonder whose side she is on. Things come to a thrilling climax in front of 4 of America's greatest presidents.Undoubtedly one of Hitchcock's best films, a fast paced, commercial, spy thriller which could have been a James Bond film, before there were James Bond films. Beautiful scenery, narrative, delivery, and general mise-en-scene make this an absolute tour-de-force - even 40-50 years later. Lots of vivid colours and stunning visuals throughout with plenty of artistic signatures from the famed director added to vehicle of the film. Some tongue in cheek fun - when you watch it bear in mind that Hitchcock enjoyed pushing the boundaries of enjoyment for audiences, so you will see things that seem totally ludicrous - just suspend your disbelief and sit back, you'll enjoy the film if you don't question it.If you enjoy old-fashioned films that don't rely on CGI then this is an absolute classic to enjoy. 8 out of 10 - a perfect wrong-man caper for a lazy Sunday.",North by Northwest
141,jhclues,"No Question, One of Hitchcock's Finest",10,7 May 2001,"A case of mistaken identity leads to kidnapping and more, in the suspenseful `North by Northwest,' directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant.  Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) has his lunch interrupted by two men who think he's someone else, a man named Kaplan, and as they escort him from the restaurant at gunpoint to a waiting car, it's only the beginning of an adventure that will take the hapless Thornhill from New York to Mount Rushmore, and introduce him to the kind of intrigue few people experience except in the movies.  And before he's through, Thornhill will have scaled the famous monument, played tag with a crop-dusting airplane and fallen in love with a beautiful woman.  It's a classic case of an ordinary person getting caught up in extraordinary events, and with Hitchcock behind it all, you know it's going to be a thrilling ride.  And it is.	With this film, Hitchcock proves once again that he is, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  With terrific foreshadowing, he has a way of tipping you off to what is about to happen, without letting you in on what's really behind the mystery.  It's part of that special touch he has that keeps it all exciting and moving along, while allowing the tension to build until the very end.  It's a precision balancing act-- keeping the story right on the wire while refusing to reveal any more than is necessary at any given point in time-- that few directors have managed to achieve so effectively. Hitchcock has an eye for detail, an innate sense of what works and knows just when to infuse some humor into his story; but a big part of his success is also that he knows how to exact the kind of performances he needs from his actors.	Grant, as expected, gives a first-rate performance as Thornhill, using his natural charm and style to great effect; It's understated, and entirely credible.  His reaction to being kidnapped is totally honest, as he affects an almost naive sense of well being even with a gun stuck in his ribs.  As you can imagine it would be in a real situation like that, he simply doesn't comprehend what's really happening.  And the transition from that point to when he fully realizes the danger he's in is extremely well handled and developed.  It's a good bit of acting by Grant, and directing by Hitchcock.	Also turning in notable performances are James Mason, suave and menacing as Phillip Vandamm, Thornhill's adversary, and Eva Marie Saint, as Eve Kendall, the woman Thornhill meets on a train and with whom he becomes quite taken, not only with her beauty, but by her candor, as well.	The great thing about Hitchcock is that he sets you up so beautifully and never fails to deliver.  He consistently gives you that sense that something is about to happen, and it always does.  When Thornhill is standing out in the middle of nowhere at a crossroads, surrounded by nothing but fields, and you see a crop-dusting plane making a pass in the distance, and then you see it again-- but Thornhill is paying it no attention whatsoever-- you know something is up.  And from that innocuous lead in, Hitchcock develops one of his most memorable scenes ever, brilliantly conceived and realized.  The same thing happens when Thornhill and Eve find themselves at the top of Mount Rushmore; you know they didn't wind up there by accident.	The supporting cast includes Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill), Leo G. Carroll (The Professor), Josephine Hutchinson (Mrs. Townsend), Philip Ober (Lester), Martin Landau (Leonard) and Edward Platt (Larrabee).  An exciting story, some engaging performances and the indelible images this film plants in your memory, all make `North by Northwest' one of Hitchcock's finest (and that's saying a lot).  Thoroughly entertaining, it's one to which you can return time and again and still be thrilled anew.  You can always rely on Hitchcock to give you a good show, and show you a good time; that's the magic of Hitchcock, and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",North by Northwest
142,Stampsfightclub,One of the best directed thrillers of all time,9,29 October 2008,"Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for another man by a group of foreign spies and after a few unfortunate events, finds himself on the run.North by Northwest is recognized as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films and with the adrenaline soaked narrative and a great central performance it is easy to see why.Cary Grant (Charade) delivers a sensational portrayal of advertising executive Roger Thornhill, a simple man who is mistaken for someone else. Thornhill is wonderfully sarcastic, very charismatic and plaudits must go to Grant who has created an original hero, an ordinary man who turns himself into an action hero within a short space of time in Alfred Hitchcock's wonderfully realistic world.Hitchcock's action styled direction is picture perfect for this fast moving thriller. The British director cements the realism down to the ground with his cutting edge close shots and the fast sweeping direction, most noticeable in the landmark plane scene in the fields.It is easy to overdo action in modern day films and Hitchcock has expertly managed to balance the action alongside the everyday events of the protagonists.This film is close to resembling a Bond styled genre, though obviously was made before Bond films were. The cocky yet sophisticated Thornhill is well directed by Hitchcock to create the ultimate action hero in a sharply written narrative that is more realistic and entertaining than the Bond spy genre.The reason this 1959 thriller works is down to all the genres it covers. Through Hitchcock's action and realistic direction, viewers are thrust into action sequences, romantic moments and crime sequences to, providing viewers with the ultimate adventure. Covering different genres is not a stroll in the park as recent films show and can be appreciated here with Hitchcock's wonderful balance.The balance of the action and romantic genres works well with the whole mystery concept of what is happening to the central character.The settings are well executed and further add to the intensity of the plot, particularly the field and the climax on Mount Rushmore.North by Northwest is a top notch action thriller, made so by Hitchcock's direction, great writing and a fine central character.",North by Northwest

145,jluis1984,Pure first class entertainment!,9,18 April 2006,"Together with ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds"", ""North by Northwest"" is among Hitchcock's most famous and praised films. It has been said that this movie marks the beginning of the action/thriller as we know it today, and not without reason as this film takes Hitchcock's favorite plot (ordinary man in unbelievable adventures) to the extreme in an epic adventure across U.S.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, an ordinary man who is mistaken for a spy and suddenly gets involved in a series of intrigues and adventures that will take him from Washington to Mount Rushmore as he tries to put an end to his problem. James Mason plays Phillip Vandamm, the international criminal who believes that Thornhill works for the U.S. government and desperately wants to kill him. Eve Marie Saint is Eve, a mysterious woman who helps Roger but has a secret agenda of her own.It is obvious that Hitchcock wanted to pleasure his audience after the mixed reviews he received in ""Vertigo"", as he gives thrill after thrill in this roller-coaster but always with class and elegance. Thornhill goes from one peril to another and the suspense is always on the rise. Also, his dark humor returns and Cary Grant definitely is the best man to deliver it.Cary Grant is perfect as Roger Thornhill, and it is probably the role of his lifetime. It is very well known the fact that James Stewart was the first choice but was rejected after the failure of ""Vertigo"". Even when personally I consider Stewart a better actor, Cary Grant was the perfect actor for the lighter Hitchcock; with his suave persona, good humor and classy elegance, Grant shines here as well as in ""suspicion"" and ""To Catch a Thief"". On the other hand, Stewart was more apt for the darker side of Hitchcock in films like ""Rope"", ""Rear Window"", and the masterpiece ""Vertigo"".Eve Marie Saint joins the ranks of the icy blonds in the Master's films, as the beautiful and mysterious Eve. There was clearly good chemistry between her and Grant, and the sexual innuendo is brilliant. One can really believe that they are a couple of lovers in the middle of the international intrigue. Martin Landau and James Mason complete the cast as the villains and they surely give brilliant performances. The young Landau was set for a bright future and he demonstrates it in this early role.Many things can be said about ""North by Northwest"", but one thing is true; while this movie is basically a series of scenes of danger and adventure, Hitchcock's masterful touch separates it from the rest and puts it in a superior place. His perfect camera-work and the score by the always effective Bernard Herrmann created immortal scenes. Sure, ""Vertigo"" is a superior movie, but it is easy to see why this one succeeded where ""Vertigo"" failed: ""North by Northwest"" was designed to please the audience.Honestly, ""North By Northwest"" is not a perfect movie, it has its flaws and it is definitely not Hitchcock's best film. However, it has a lot of something special that can only be classified as ""magic"" that one can't help but enjoy the 136 minutes of thrills and adventure that the Master of Suspense prepared for us. 9/10",North by Northwest
146,The_Movie_Cat,"""A little more polished than the others... but I'm afraid just as obvious.""",7,5 February 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS
One of the better efforts from Alfred Hitchcock, a man who directed extremely well but generally chose substandard material.There's a frightening lack of innovation on display here. There are the usual aerial shots, and some panning upwards, though nothing as groundbreaking as forward zoom/reverse tracking. Though as with Psycho, this is a film that doesn't need any such gimmickry.The humour involved in any Hitchcock endeavour  his English sense of detached irony meeting the players' American Vaudevillian  jars as usual, though Cary Grant does better than most with some witty lines. It starts almost like a comic version of The Trial, with Grant caught in a fight for his life and with reasons he can't fathom. Things soon touch on vague Vertigo territory, with a ""meet a duplicitous woman in a hotel room"" sequence. By the end, though, the whole thing has been wrapped up as one of the director's ultimately straightest  and therefore most accessible  works.Occasionally, the dialogue is a little trite  ""War is Hell, Mr.Thornhill, even when it's a cold one""  though generally the script is quite snappy and sharp for this kind of thing. The shorthand characterisation is exemplified by Grant saying to Eva Marie Saint: ""The moment I meet an attractive woman I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her."" Wouldn't it be great if lines like that worked in real life? They don't, I've tried it. Worst scene is the crushingly bad exposition where the FBI discusses the plot. ""Our non-existent decoy, George Kaplan, created to divert suspicion from our actual agent."" All the people in the room knew about this event, so why does the Professor (Leo G. Carroll, not a good performance) need to describe it, and the elaborate movements for the ruse? Okay, it's to relay the information to the viewers, we all know that, but it's so badly done. The only high point is that before the Professor starts this clumsy dialogue sequence his shoe squeaks on the floor and it sounds like he's just broken wind. Maybe that was Hitchcock's sly comment on the script? The situation is also redeemed slightly by having the Professor later explain the plot to Grant... only to have it drowned out for the viewers by the sound of an aeroplane. The revelation of the microfilm in the statue is also delivered less than plausibly, though this again may be Hitchcock's lazy sense of humour. Avoid the need for screen realism by presenting it as a joke.Yet despite these problems, it still largely stands up, though it's always a shock to see black actors cast only as porters or auction menials. The colour is also washed-out, and the use of filmed and scenic backdrops more than a little obvious. Though mere technicalities shouldn't prevent enjoyment of a reasonably fast-paced plot, and it does contain a passable recreation of Mount Rushmore on it's $4 million budget. This is a film that's over forty years old, after all. The crop duster attack is a sequence that has been ripped off/homaged in more films and television than can be counted, an infamous segment. And of course, the swirling, dizzying theme is brilliant. It's an enjoyable light thriller, but blown up to be hailed as a classic it can only disappoint. 7/10.",North by Northwest
147,gab-14712,Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Film!,9,6 October 2018,"Over the course of his career, Alfred Hitchcock has made many highly-regarded works and every film of his was treated like an event. After a very successful decade of the 1950's which includes famed works such as Rear Window and Vertigo, Hitchcock closes out the decade with perhaps his greatest work, 1959's North by Northwest. After the dark erotic film that was Vertigo, Hitchcock decided to make something more fun, action/adventure-oriented, and something light-hearted in general. This film is essentially the first James Bond film, even though the first James Bond film would be produced several years later. This is an incredibly tense and suspenseful spy thriller that boasts two of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history-the crop duster scene and the dramatic rescue upon the rocks of Mount Rushmore. This film has lots of incredible talent working on camera and behind the scenes. In addition to Hitchcock, we have great acting from the likes of Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. The film was written by one of the greatest screenwriters of the era, Ernest Lehman. The film has a distinctive look because of Robert Burks's camerawork and texture is given to the sound of the movie because of the eerie score of Bernard Hermann's. This movie is a tense spy thriller, a screwball romantic comedy, and a tale about the Cold War/paranoia/government spying all in one movie. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a successful Manhattan advertising agent who is abducted by two strange men at the Plaza Hotel. Thornhill is taken to the mansion of a foreign spy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) where he is believed to be an undercover federal agent named George Kaplan. Thornhill denies it, and he is forced to drink bourbon and to ride in a car down a twisted, winding road. He escapes the planned execution, and the police refuses to believe his story. He eventually gets framed for murder and now is on the run. He takes a cross-country train to make his escape where he runs into the mysterious, cold femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). It is unclear at first why she wants to aid him, but we later learn she may be more than meets the eye. From the train, we then head to those famous scenes involving the murderous crop duster airplane in the cornfields of Illinois and the harrowing escape from Mt. Rushmore. The acting is very good, but that really should not be a surprise given the names of the cast. To this point, Cary Grant had a very long career. This might be his best performance. The contributions he added to the film is wonderful. Eva Marie Saint, who made an impression acting opposite of Marlon Brando in 1954's On the Waterfront, adds elegance and class to the role of Eve Kendall. James Mason plays a convincing villain and he does seem like the prototypical James Bond villain. His henchman, Leonard is played by the wonderful Martin Landau. Landau would go on to have a wonderful late-age career, but let's not forget that he was in an Alfred Hitchcock film. There are so many Alfred Hitchcock films to choose from when it comes to naming his best film, but I can say without a doubt that North by Northwest is his most entertaining film. In addition to making the spy genre more accessible to the audience, Hitchcock and Lehman added a little bit of everything. We have quirky and funny dialogue, great action/chase scenes, and some lovely romance. Also, I really need to discuss the crop duster scene. That scene was made so well, and my heart wanted to explode because of how tense that scene was. I felt scared for Cary Grant's character. I am quite amazed at the technical achievement that went to making that scene, and even by today's standards. Are there themes/motifs behind the film? Both Hitchcock and Lehman said no. However, given the time of the film's release, there are some central ideas regarding Cold War paranoia and government spying. If you like James Bond films, you have this movie to thank. Come for the (multiple) twists, stay to see an entertaining spy thriller. My Grade: A",North by Northwest

More interesting works like 'Rope' and 'Birds' have daring elements that make them stronger.Cary Grant is a block of wood.  Heck all the acting is simple by today's standards.  The plot, too, is nothing remarkable since there have been so many other ""running man/conspiracy"" movies since this one.

152,jem132,"Thrill, Spills....and Hitch!",10,26 May 2006,"Cary Grant is THE James Bond who never was.He was approached to play the role in the early 60's but he declined, citing that he was too old. Sean Connery got the job instead, and was a huge success. But one feels that Grant would have been the definitive Bond if he ever played the role. This, and 'Notorious', are certainly his best films for Hitchcock, and this is certainly his best Bond-type role. He stars as Roger O. Thornhill, a suave, womanising, New York advertising executive who is drawn into a web of intrigue after suffering a case of mistaken identity. He ends up being pursued across the country, unwittingly embroiling himself further in the web with his dalliances with Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint, as the Is She Good Or Is She Bad? femme)and others.Hitchock's favoured 'Wrong Man' situation is utilised perfectly here, as Grant is caught up in circumstances that he has no control over. But Grant takes it on the chin, and his charisma and comedic timing as Thornhill are excellent. This is a most entertaining and humorous Hitchcock film that maintains it's pace and action for over two hours. The suspense never lets up, as we are treated with some truly amazing sequences, including the finale atop Mt Rushmore, a UN headquarters visit, and THAT pesky crop duster. And keep in mind that these are just a few of the many, many amazing scenes here.Eva Marie Saint is so different here from the innocent Edie Doyle role in 'On The Waterfront' that garnered her an Oscar. She's matured into a sweetly seductive woman of the world who Grant falls head over heels for. Their encounter on the train is filled with corny pick-up lines and rather silly yet juicy dialogue, but it WORKS. One feels cheated when the train affair actually ends; re-winding is essential.Hitch's love of trains is also conveyed perfectly here, with the train symbolising sexual attraction and mystery (check the closing shot especially- very overt symbolism!), as Grant and Saint ride on board. We also have great villains in James Mason and Marty Landau. The very charismatic James Mason is wonderful as the trademark very charismatic Hitchcock villain, Phillip Vandamm. His trademark mellifluous voice and dark good looks (is this man not insanely attractive?)are used to great effect here. He gets many great lines.This is a re-working of Hitchcock's British film, The Thirty-Nine Steps (1935) with Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll. Comparison is not really warranted, as they films from entirely different era's and made in different countries with vastly differing budgets. However, 'North by Northwest' jumps over the earlier effort when they are compared as just two Hitchcock films from the cannon.Made a year after 'Vertigo' bombed, 'North By Northwest' is seen by many as Hitch's safe, crowd-pleaser film. True in many ways, yet it is an unassailable classic regardless of any formulaic overtones. Grant is perfect in this rip-roaring ride full of suspense.10/10.",North by Northwest
153,TheNorthernMonkee,"remarkably fresh, incredibly intense, ends a bit too fast",8,9 August 2005,"SPOILERS Everybody loves Hitchcock. It's strange, but irrelevant of how many times you've seen his films, you always find something new in them. Whether it's Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, Jimmy Stewart in his wheelchair, or Cary Grant scoring on a train, Hitchcock has got some of the most famous actors of the time to confirm their legend status with his films. Hitchcock's films are also remembered for the forever spoofed or replayed scenes which we know and love. The birds on the climbing frame, the shower scene, the Mount Rushmore climb, all these and many more have been given tribute by Matt Groening's 'Simpsons' and in modern culture, you don't get many higher tributes.Written in 1959, 'North by Northwest' is one of Hitchcock's more memorable films. Remembered more for the already mentioned Rushmore scene, the film boasts some genuinely amazing performances, as well as some of Hitchcock's masterful tension. Intense and powerful, it also contains some absolutely superb lines and one of the finest train journeys of all time. It's a brilliant film, ruined ever so slightly by the final 30 seconds which feel rushed and incomplete. Still, at over two hours long, there is so much going for this film that you'll never grow tired of it.Roger O Thornhill (Cary Grant) is just a regular, financially secure advertising executive for a major film. Accidentally mistaken for a spy, Thornhill's life takes an unexpected turn when he is kidnapped and taken to see the evil Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Plied with alcohol and thrown into a car, Thornhill finds that staying alive has become a new chief priority. Chased by Vandamm and the police at the same time, Thornhill now must uncover the truth behind the mistaken identity and discover just what it is he is meant to know.Led by the enigmatic Grant, 'North by Northwest' is a brilliant film for two key reasons. Firstly, the entire cast are on top notch form. As the unfortunate Thornhill, Grant is exquisite and lights up the screen for every second that he is on screen. At the same time, both Mason as the bad guy and Eva Marie Saint as the love interest fulfil their roles perfectly. They add humour, they add intensity, and most importantly they add intrigue to roles which are stunningly created by writer Ernest Lehman.The second reason for the film's brilliance is the simple way that you are twisted and turned and completely stunned by certain key events. Times like the legendary plane chase, the magnificent realisation of the truth behind Saint's character, all add together to produce a film which is actually rather special.In fact, aside from one or two incredibly sickening lines, the only real problem with 'North by Northwest' is that ending. Rushed and confused, it feels like Hitchcock has cut ten minutes out of the end to reduce the film's length. This is obviously not the case and it's just been written badly, but the haste with which the film just stops is a mild irritation, if purely because your so hyped up on adrenaline from the rest of the film. In a way, it's a bit like watching live sport only for someone to turn off the match with ten minutes left and tell you the final score. Sometimes a calming down period and a proper resolution are needed, and sadly in 'North by Northwest' this never appears.In possession of some of the most famous film moments in history, Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest' is a brilliant film. Well written and acted, it is a roller-coaster ride which never lets off until it's disappointing rushed conclusion. With so much intensity throughout, it feels weird that the film does climax in such a way, but ultimately for the two hours plus before hand, you can forgive the creators for their impatience. Beautiful to watch, and powerful throughout, 'North by Northwest' is justifiably one of Hitchcock's finest.",North by Northwest
154,FilmOtaku,"A Hitchcock classic, but not among his best",7,25 August 2004,"`North by Northwest', written by Ernest Lehman and directed by Alfred Hitchcock, stars Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who finds himself embroiled in a particularly nasty case of mistaken identity. He finds himself being mistaken for a gentleman who is wrapped up in some dirty dealings with Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), his henchman Leonard (Martin Landau) and various other unsavory thugs under Vandamm's employ.  He also meets up with Hitchcock's requisite blonde femme fatale, Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and surrounded by this cast of characters makes a cross-country adventure where his life is threatened several times; all the while with Thornhill having to depend on his wits to keep him alive.
While `North by Northwest' is a good film, I don't consider it to be one of his best, which, at least in my small circle of rabid film friends/relatives, is fairly sacrilegious.  I enjoy the vibrancy of the script and the lush cinematography, but there are a couple of things that cause the film to fall short of excellence on my personal Hitchcock scale. Mainly, there's the matter of James Mason as the villain.  Mason is a great actor, and has been in some really good films, so his talents were wasted as the tepid Vandamm.  There simply really wasn't a part for him in the film; rather, most of the relatively `juicy' bits were relegated to Martin Landau. It seemed that the concentration was solely on Grant's character, which in most cases is adequate, but in a suspense film, I personally like to see the villain have a more pervasive presence.  Of course, there are some masterful elements to this film.  The infamous cornfield scene is truly masterful.  It isn't even the shot of the crop duster chasing down Grant  the image that gets me every time is the very quick shot of Grant standing across the dusty road from the gentleman waiting for the bus.  As he is sizing him up, trying to figure out if he is the man that he has traveled a long distance to see, Hitchcock frames the shot much like a classic western.  There are many shots like this that, if frozen, would make a compelling photograph.  I can also acknowledge, while I am not as much a fan of Hitchcock's comedic moments as I am of the more dark or horrifying ones, that the comic timing with which Grant delivers his lines is excellent.  His charisma certainly adds a spark to the film, and there are times when he is so smooth that even if something was completely unbelievable I had to laugh and say, `Hey, it's Cary Grant  what do you expect?'`North by Northwest' was made in 1959 and is more akin to the whimsical and much-eschewed `The Trouble with Harry' than his more story-driven films of the 1940's and his horrifying masterpiece a year later, 1960's, `Psycho'. While I acknowledge that `North by Northwest' is a good film, it doesn't even make my personal `Hitchcock Top Ten' on which his darker films dwell. However, it's kind of the way I feel about the Coen Brothers  even a simply `good' film of theirs is usually much better than the average film, so a slightly above-average Hitchcock film like `North by Northwest' garners at least three stars from me.--Shelly",North by Northwest

158,kenandraf,Classic but not Hitch's best,9,1 July 2001,This great Hitchcock movie delivers although not as great as Hitchcock's earlier works like Rear Window or Vertigo.Some scenes in this movie were over rated but still this movie deserves it's due respect due to the great great cinematography.This movie is more mainstream flavored than the usual Hitchcock classics so there are some annoying childish scenes and situations but the flow of great quality scenes one after another wins the movie watcher's forgiveness.Grant was good here but I have seen him perform better......,North by Northwest
159,Ben_Cheshire,I finally get how great it is: Hitch infuses his wrong-man caper with ironic movie language and reality-be-damned escapism and suspense.,8,24 July 2004,"Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront.  Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that"" - he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10",North by Northwest
160,tonypeacock-1,Hitchcock can do action!,10,30 April 2020,"Excellent Alfred Hitchcock film that really is ahead of its time. I say that in several respects which I will allude to.The film from 1959 is about an innocent man (Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill). Thornhill gets mistaken for a U.S. secret agent in a chase across the country that involves scenes of death, amazing action sequences of suspense and the love of an attractive female. I've heard of Cary Grant of course but I admit to never seeing any of his many films. He immediately reminded me of Sir. Roger Moore with his suave demeanour, one liners whilst under pressure and getting the girl.Hitchcock films are of course well known for their technical wizardry. North By Northwest doesn't disappoint in this respect. Simple scenes of cars and the interior of train carriages filmed in the studio look realistic long before CGI ever existed.The film has several dramatic action sequences that wouldn't have looked out of place in a modern spy film. I'm thinking of a chase sequence whilst being followed by an overhead crop duster and scenes in Mount Rushmore. The film has comedic moments intertwined with scenes of murder.Look out for Thornhill acting the fool at an auction. I never expected to be as entertained by such an old film.",North by Northwest
161,RonellSowes,Excellence on every level,10,3 November 2020,"While viewing Fargo for the first time celebrated film critic,Roger Ebert, turned to his colleague and said ""This is why I like movies"". Personally, I wouldn't describe Fargo that way but I feel that comment aptly describes how I regard North By Northwest.
Probably Hitchcock's most popular film behind Psycho, North By Northwest is a film that continues to thrill audiences six decades after its release and for one simple reason. It is excellence on every level.First of all just examine the title which is derived from Hamlet. As he starts to go mad, Hamlet describes that he's north-northwest; like a compass which points in the wrong direction he is off in his mind. In the film, you could say, Thornhill is mistaken for another man which fits with the theme of something being off target. It definetly takes a moment to full grasp the title and it speaks for Ernest Lehman's intellect. Of course Lehman's skill extends beyond the title and every aspect of the script is nearly perfect.There is just enough introduction and quickly after meeting Thornhill the story takes off. We are just as mystified as Thornhill about what's going on and why ? Then the stakes are raised by shifting from Thornhill simply trying to prove his story about what happened last night to him becoming a murder suspect and national fugitive who is trying to hide from the police,clear his name and find the real men responsible. The film is filled with twists that are timed perfectly, just when you're comfortable with the plot it changes on you and then rechanges.
The dialogue is humorous and witty and keeps every conversation fascinating with its fluctuating discussion.This is one of if not the career defining roles for Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Both were slightly miscast,though Thornhill's age isn't specified, he is probably supposed to be younger than the fifty five year old Grant. And Eva Marie Saint was eight years older than her character who is identified to be twenty six. However, the picture is unimaginable without them in it.This being the six hundred and twenty fifth review I'm not sure if there's anything left to say on the man himself...Hitchcock. Not to undermine their contributions in anyway but Grant,Lehman,Herrman and all the others are really just the tools Hitchcock used to craft this masterpiece. If you carefully study this film you will constantly notice the smallest of details which add so much to a scene and the entire film. Or notice how he is able to tell so much with a single shot and how he can perfectly convey every emotion in brilliant fashion.
Of course these are simply a few,brief words on the quality of this film and there is so much that is left out. Whether or not you enjoy classic films,thrillers,or mysteries you should watch this film.",North by Northwest
162,perfectbond,Outstanding spy thriller,9,18 March 2003,"This film is enjoyable on so many levels. In addition to being his usual dashing and debonair self, Cary Grant also plays being flustered very convincingly. Eva Marie Saint (who hosts a very interesting documentary of the film on the DVD) is elegant and graceful in the tradition of Grace Kelly which Hitchcock loves so much. James Mason as Van Damme and Martin Landau as Leonard wonderfully underscore their villainy thereby make its implication more threatening than the actual execution (no pun intended). Van Damme and Leonard also appear to have a homosexual undertone in their relationship. There are so many memorable moments in this film. My favorite is the encounter between Roger and Eve on the train. Superb film. Highly recommended, 9/10.",North by Northwest

One successful, suave, married and divorced expert on advertising is accidentally involved into an international spy network of intrigue and conspiracy. He has been replaced for an international spy. His quiet life has turned upside down...One nonchalant character is exposed to a serious spy game. He was pushed into a series of shocking and confusing situation at the beginning of the film. These situations are enriched with a large dose of a fresh humor. Hitch has presented a serious life situation or perhaps intriguing drama on a very entertaining way. The main character is not aware of the fraud. He is simply the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time.After that, Hitch has moved his protagonists to an exciting game between a search and pursuit. It is a strange game between cats and mice. An extremely rich scenery comes to the fore in these parts of the film.There is also an eight-minute scene, which I would describe as a masterpiece of cinema. The scene representing expectation through fear of the unknown, tension and excitement. It ends with the climatic action.Cary Grant as Roger Thornhill is a puppet, a charmer and a hero in this film. Mr. Grant is one of the most versatile actors of all time. It can be noticed, when he has created his own rules of the game. He is a somewhat clumsy, self-confident and foolhardy character. Eva Marie Saint as Eve Kendall is a seemingly fragile, mysterious and dangerous woman. Her character reminds of heroines from James Bond films. The chemistry between the main protagonists is quite good. Their interplay and romantic dialogues with sexual connotation are very favorable.Their support are Jessie Royce Landis (Clara Thornhill) as a silly Roger's mother, James Mason (Phillip Vandamm) as a smooth villain, Martin Landau (Leonard), who has a homosexual trait in his character and Leo G.

164,barryrd,One of Hitch's Best,9,23 March 2012,"Coming in the midst of Hitchcock's most productive and highly rated period as a director, this movie is definitely one of his best. To me, it is one of the most entertaining films I've ever watched. It is a double identity thriller involving a New York ad executive, played by Cary Grant, whose routine suddenly falls apart when he is suddenly thrust into the role of a decoy in an international game of espionage. His female counterpart is a secret agent played by Eva Marie Saint, who meets up with him on a train to Chicago. The movie is stylish, with a well written dialogue, stunning photography, humour and suspense. It has the picture postcard look of the 1950's in a series of settings that take the viewer from New York's United Nations and Grand Central Terminal to the Mid-Western cornfields and finally to Mount Rushmore in North Dakota. Leo G. Carroll is the mastermind of the espionage game that pits him against James Mason on the other side, although the two never meet. Mason's henchmen are led by Martin Landau, the star of Woody Allen's Crimes and Misdemenors 30+years later. The one flaw that I saw was that Grant was far older than the character he played; however, Grant's stellar performance and iconic presence is memorable. Always a joy to watch, viewers are treated to the witty dialogue and funny scenes that keep coming throughout the movie, not to mention the scintillating repartee among the main characters.",North by Northwest

Interesting that the film starts with the presence of the director Hitchcock in its first scene. Then Cary Grant became for unknown reasons a man (spy) called Kaplan, he was kidnapped at the restaurant and brought to a big house where the punishment was to get him drunk with whiskey and then left driving a car in the evening. I have no intention to give the whole story of the plot, but you may guess that after these first scenes the rest was very much complicated and if you leave the screen you risk to loose the coherence of the film and not to understand all tricky reasons given by Hitchcock. Grant had a good partner in then beautiful Eva Marie Saint, and to a lesser extent from experienced James Mason. If you wish to see an interesting film, I advise you to see this one, another Hitchcock's jewel.",North by Northwest
166,ofpsmith,A precursor to the modern day action films.,10,17 June 2014,"Alfred Hitchcock really shows his expertise in suspense with this thriller. But also his expertise in action too. Here's the plot. Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an advertising executive but is thought to be a government agent under the name George Kaplan. They force him to drink an entire bottle of alcohol and they put him an a moving Mercedes Benz so he is arrested for drunk driving. He goes back to New York but after pulling a knife out of a man that an assassin threw, the police think he is a terrorist. Roger goes on a quest with CIA agent Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) and finds out that the FBI planted Kaplan as a decoy. But now that he's assumed the role, he's actually enlisted to become Kaplan. He ends up talking with the lead criminal Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) at an auction who has assassins all around. Roger makes a scene so no one can attack him without being seen, and then punches a man so the police take him away. He eventually meets up with Vandamm and Eve again. Eve shoots Roger in the Mount Rushmore café to get away from him. She goes to Vandamm's country home but Roger saves her from being killed. At the end there's a spectacular chase scene on Mount Rushmore. It's one of the most famous movie scenes ever like the crop duster chase that happens earlier, in the film. I say go check this one out. But in my opinion it's not as good as Rear Window (1954).",North by Northwest
167,silverscreen888,"Epic Noir Thriller, Famous For Action Scenes and Smart Dialogue",8,16 June 2005,"""North By Northwest"", Alfred Hitchcock's mature masterwork of camera-work, is even better liked by the director's admirers than it is admired by film critics. It is long, expansive, filled with scenic and interesting changes of locales, and it is I suggest always an exciting cinema noir color adventure. The story was Hitchcock's, written as a film at his request by Ernest Lehman, and then extensively rewritten before production; at every point, I can attest, Hitchcock was increasing the realism of the treatment. The story, apart from its 'epic' feel and large number of characters, is another case of the""Rear Window"", ""Man Who Knew Too Much"" genre that Hitchcock mined so extensively but did not discover. The ""ordinary"" man drawn into a web of adventure, intrigue and danger in this case is Roger O.Thornhill, Madison Avenue advertising executive. Mistaken for a government spy, he is kidnapped and taken to meet a mysterious master criminal. What follows is a succession of scenes logically developing from this premise, and one more--the fact that the spy for whom he was mistaken never existed...The scenes for which this film is famous for comprise more than almost any other suspense film can boast--the Long Island estate series, the United Nations series, the Chicago train station series, the 20th Century Limited series, the Four Corners highway series, the hotel series, the auction gallery series, the Rapid City series and the safe house series. The acting is also above average, especially Eva Marie Sant as Eve Kendall and James Mason as Philip Van Damm. Others in the cast include Martin Landau, Leo G. Carroll, Jessie Royce Landis and Josephine Hutchinson. But the understated achievement of this masterpiece of music (Bernard Herrmann), art direction, lighting, sound, costumes and settings is the dialogue. Hitchcock often used dialogue whose purpose was aimed at something other than the main purpose of the ongoing scene. The great scene where Van Damm tries to get Thornhill to confess what he doesn't know, the dinner scene between Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant as Thornhill on a train escaping west, the hotel and auction house scenes and those involving the Leo G. Carroll as the devious Professor make possible much of the film's unusual power. Then there is the sheer physicality of the production's legendary action sequences--the car pursuit of an inebriated Grant, the crop-duster plane strafing sequence, and the final two scenes of Grant invading the enemy's house and then Grant and Saint escaping down the Mt. Rushmore monument have never been bettered. As Thornhill, Grant is more-than-adequate, since the director turned the story toward touches of comedy to relieve the tension he was building, though not ideal. The dozens of others in the large cast seldom have more than a few lines, save for Les Tremayne, Olin Soule, Patrick McVey and Ken Lynch in the auction scene and its aftermath. There are small errors in pacing several during the two sequences in the house used by Van Damm and elsewhere; and the line of development followed, though highly imaginative, was not always the strongest possible. But the artistry of this film is so well-realized that every scene, even the slightly imperfect, come near to being perfectly achieved, reinforcing their memorability. The love story involved incidentally is among the most interesting this side of ""Rear Window"". It is to be regretted that Hitchcock never again attempted a film as important, long or impressively mounted as this one, although ""Topaze"" comes the closest. I confess to watching even half this film every time that I can; from the opening allegory of city life--in the form of levels of human traffic involvement--to the final allegory of sex in a train entering a tunnel, I find this film to be masterfully presented and vastly entertaining on many levels.",North by Northwest
168,FlickJunkie-2,"Better than most, but not Hitchcock's best",9,21 April 2001,"This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that `The Master of Suspense' stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else. Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one. However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter. Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior. Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter, and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore is one the classic suspense scenes in the history of film.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he was refused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in `On The Waterfront', but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (`Psycho', `Vertigo' and `Rear Window'). I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question. Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.",North by Northwest
169,roedyg,Many ways to enjoy,9,14 June 2013,"North By North West was made in 1959. You can enjoy it many ways. Let me enumerate: 1. It a predecessor to the James bond films with oily villains with interesting accents, and questionable sexuality out to kill in imaginative ways, always toying with their victims rather that simply shooting them outright. Cary Grant plays a character who likes brave clever repartee with his captors, though he has none of Bond's lethality, just his confidence.2. it is a love story, with lots of clever repartee.3. it is a comedy. Grant's cleverness and unrestrained originality at getting out of scrapes is amusing as is the existential strangeness of the predicaments.4. It is a period drama. It was filmed in 1959 with a cast of tens of thousands, all in accurate 1959 period costumes, and accurate period cars, in accurate period hotels, restaurants, streets and taxis. All this was much cheaper to do then. It is a treat for the eye.5. It is an adventure story with a car chase, explosions and the famous crop dusting scene, but because the special effects are somewhat dated, this aspect would not have the punch it would originally.6. It is a mystery with all manner twists and terms making you guess who is working for whom. It would probably take at least three viewings to begin to figure out the motives for each character at each point in the film.It is an oldie but goodie.",North by Northwest

An advertising agent Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a non-existent and virtual government agent George Kaplan and chased around the country by agents and he finds ways to survive them all with a bit of humor and an affair with another mysterious agent Eva Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).This Alfred Hitchcock movie has the typical stamp of all Alfred Hitchcock movies. It is fast paced, it is set in urban areas, it has mystery and suspense, it has good humor and it has some good sets.Some scenes are memorable, the first when Alfred makes his cameo in the beginning of the movie when he misses catching a city bus, the glider plane scene that comes to attack Cary Grant, and the final action against the backdrop of Statues of Great American Presidents. All of them make great viewing. I could imagine with Hitchcock and Cary in their prime popularity would have raked great reviews when the movie would had been released.Today, after 48 years  the movie still remains watch-able, pleasant, and over-all a good cinematic experience; but surely it does not give the same amount of classic mastery feel that some other Hitchcockian movies has.The drunken driving scene of Cary Grant is so poorly executed with Cary overacting to the hilt of affairs and looks so artificial, un-natural and over-dramatic. Otherwise Cary Grant has charming personality. Seeing Eva Marie Saint reminded me of Julia Roberts  Julia Roberts rise to fame must have to do with the type of looks she has  typical American Hollywood heroines.The music as in all Hitchcock movie is very Jazz and Mozart type  especially in chase and action scenes.A good movie, but I won't agree it being a great classic by the master.(Stars 6.5 out of 10)",North by Northwest

He may have made better movies, artistically speaking, like Vertigo and Psycho. But for me neither surpasses the entertainment this movie provides.This is a chase movie and follows Cary Grant as a New York businessman, Roger Thornhill, who's mistaken by spies as a secret agent and is forced to flee from them while trying to get in touch with someone who will help him clear the mess he got into. It's pretty much nonstop action filled with very tense situations and sequences. The movie is famous for the amazing airplane sequence, but there is more to the movie than that.This is also a delightful romance movie, when Roger meets Eve (played by Eva maria Saint) aboard a train and she becomes an ally in his mission. Their relationship goes through many twists, but the chemistry between Grant and Marie Saint is perfect and the happy ending is one of the most deserved I've ever seen in a movie.Ernest Lehman provides the screenplay, which is one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. Legend has it that Hitchcock merely gave Lehman a few key scenes and Lehman built the entire story out of them. What he achieved was a funny, lighthearted thriller full of humor and hilarious lines and bigger-than-life characters.I've never seen Cary Grant this dashing and heroic and amusing before except in a very Hitchcockian movie called Charade. He was an amazing actor who brought lightness and invention to the screen with ease, and here he gives perhaps his best performance.As far as thrillers go, North By Northwest remains one of the masterpieces of the genre, showing just what the genre can achieve when filmmakers are only willing to be original and inventive.",North by Northwest

Along the way, Grant is ridiculed by his mother (Jesse Royce Landis, who is hilarious, if actually YOUNGER than Grant), seduced by double-agent Eva Marie Saint (in the sexiest role of her career), chased across a cornfield by a lethal crop duster (in one of the greatest scenes in film history), and recruited into the intelligence community (represented by future 'Man from U.N.C.L.E.' boss, Leo G.

Unfortunately, I'm not a cinematography graduate or anything...It's just a great old Hitchcock film, one that is still enjoyable to watch 55 years after it was made. One thing I liked in particular about the movie is how it showed a 1959 America that is sparkling and cool, functional and beautiful. Everyone was dressed up to the hilt. It's like a time machine.I was delighted by the seduction scene between Roger and Eve, especially Eve's sexy forwardness. No wonder Grant's character was bowled over. Saint's performance here was astonishing.Grant's too actually. A real old-school movie star, Grant carried the movie really well. He conveyed a suaveness, charm and sense of humour you just don't see anymore. Times have changed! The film had a fast pace and good story that made you wonder where it was leading and what was coming next. The dialogue is snappy, so you have to listen closely.The movie lacks the naturalness or realism you'd expect in a modern film (that doesn't involve superheroes or giant lizards). Every character was a character. It felt staged, as if every scene was meant to be iconic. There was a certain mannerliness and at times even a campness to it.

The point of the film was obviously non-stop action, a genuine sense of entertainment throughout, and for the time very impressive visuals, as the ending scene is an absolute token of; and while the dialog is very good and in parts superb, and there is enough to keep the viewer's attention with the various characters, the stakes, the mystery, the action and very good performances given by Grant, Mason, Saint... the film still feels a bit 'far-fetched', like it really wants to go somewhere and stops at nothing to, even if it may've benefited from strengthening the 'how' to get there.

176,oOoBarracuda,North by Northwest,8,2 November 2016,"File this one under a film that I am supposed to like a lot more than I do being a huge Hitchcock and movie fan. I am also not a Cary Grant fan, so maybe that's the problem. Anyway, in 1959, Hitchcock and Cary Grant teamed up again in North by Northwest, also starring Eva Marie Saint. North by Northwest involved the common Hitchcock theme of mistaken identity when a New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies. A thriller providing audiences with one of cinema's most well-known scenes, North by Northwest is a treat in Hitchcock's filmography.In the middle of a business meeting, Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) rises from the table to make a phone call when he is intercepted by a group of foreign spies believing him to be a government agent by the name of George Kaplan. No amount of urging will convince the spies that they have nabbed the wrong man, and Thornhill seems to be in inescapable trouble. After several murder attempts, Roger is able to escape, and while he is trying to make sense of the reason of his mistaken identity, Roger then becomes sought after by police as well. Seeking help and a place to hide, Roger comes across a beautiful woman called Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who helps him out of a jam and gives him an ally for his exploits. Soon after their chance meeting, however, Roger learns that Eve isn't the lily white innocent woman he thought she was, leaving Roger alone to evade capture along the crevices of Mt. Rushmore. Although, admittingly, no fan of Cary Grant's, I was more than overjoyed to see him play such a subtly funny character as he did in North by Northwest. It had been years since I had last seen North by Northwest, and I remembered not liking it much more than I did on this viewing. I quite enjoyed the first half of the film and the debonair yet comedic performance of Cary Grant's, I really don't remember him being as funny. It is interesting to note that the leading lady doesn't appear on screen until 45 minutes into the film. The pacing drops a little bit after that point, but the two principles interact well together on screen. Although I don't hold the prestige for this film as I should, being a student of Hitchcock's work, I enjoyed enough bits in the film to garner at least a viewing a year, as that's about all the Cary Grant that I can handle.",North by Northwest
177,garethcrook,Hitch at his best,10,19 April 2020,"The Bernard Herrmann music, the Saul Bass titles and as those names hit the screen, Cary Grant, James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, of course Hitchcock himself, the hairs stand up on the back of my neck, as we begin the next instalment of our Lockdown Hitch Retrospective. I adore the energy of this film. Yes it's packed with classic suspense, but it's also a thrilling ride at quite blistering pace. We start in the hustle and bustle of the city as Ad man Roger Thornhill (Grant), gets caught in a case of mistaken identity as the wanted spy George Caplin, wanted by Phillip Vandamm (Mason), he of most wonderful voice. In fact all the voices here are rather special. Right from the get go we're thrust into the murky world of Cold War espionage. Thornhill gets chased by goons, turns out to be an excellent drunk driver and in his attempts to figure out what's going on, only digs himself deeper, with one suspenseful scene after another.
The scenes, oh boy! That aforementioned cliff side night time car chase, the murder at the United Nations building. Literal back stabbing and all before we get to the Prairie stop. The crop duster scene is a stone cold classic, a beautiful contrast of starkness against the otherwise majestic backdrops. Like the cafe at Mount Rushmore, Vandamm's gorgeous home and Rushmore itself. I suppose the chase scene finale over Mount Rushmore is considered the centrepiece, but truthfully any number of locations here would be fitting of such praise. That they're all packed into one film and so cohesively is astonishing. It does feel like it relies a lot on the stunning locations, but the plot really is fantastic. Add to that some classic 50s dialogue and genuine stars delivering it, it's clear to see why this works so well. You forget how funny and charming it is too, Grant delivers some wonderful lines and his chemistry with Saint is pure Hollywood romance. Martin Landau as the sinister and rather bird-like Leonard, personifies the dangerous world this slick production inhabits and in any other film would steal the show. I can't find a single flaw and nor would I want to. North By Northwest makes you want to love it... and I do.",North by Northwest
178,christophe92300,Doesn't live up to the expectation,5,4 March 2013,"North By Northwest starts pretty well: it's intriguing, tense, captivating. Not for long unfortunately, because after barely about 30 minutes, the pace, suspense, tension, drop significantly and the movie becomes totally convenient and linear until the final outcome.Hitchcock piles up overlong passages such as the train trip and the romance between Roger and Eve that seemed endless, and questionable ideas like the plane scene or the final chase at Mount Rushmore, unrealistic and ending the film in the most abrupt way. And that is only a small part of the conveniences and incoherences that badly discredit the script.Under these circumstances, how can this movie be considered an all time classic ? Yes, the direction and mise-en-scène are good, if you put aside the dated special effects and extensive use of matte paintings, but that hardly compensates for a mediocre scenario.",North by Northwest

180,jhaggardjr,Spectacular thriller,10,25 June 2000,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a classic thriller. I think this is Hitchcock's second best movie (his best is ""Psycho""). It has everything. Thrills, action, suspense, comedy, and great performances. Cary Grant has never been better as Roger Thornhill, a man who gets in way over his head when he's framed for murder. James Mason is terrific as the head bad guy, Martin Landau (35 years before his Oscar-winning role in ""Ed Wood"") is scary as one of Mason's henchmen, and Eva Marie Saint is wonderful as the mystery woman who helps Grant out and falls in love with him. ""North by Northwest"" is a very exciting adventure that never gets boring for one minute. There are lots of great scenes in this film. From an intoxicated Grant driving a car to get away from the bad guys early on to the dust-cropping scene midway through to the Mount Rushmore scenes late, I was into this film from the fascinating opening credits to the thrilling climax. The Master of Suspense as made some classic movies. ""North by Northwest"" is definitely one of them.

181,SKG-2,Hitch's best,10,15 March 1999,"Hitchcock always called PSYCHO his ""fun"" picture.  It seems to me this film, which is my favorite of his, would fit that term better (though PSYCHO, a great film, may have been more fun for him, because it was probably less of a hassle physically to shoot, and because it appealed to his warped sense of humor), since this basically kids the genre he helped invent, the suspense thriller.  The plot, when you think about it, is a remake of his own THE 39 STEPS, and although I'm not a Hitchcock expert, others could probably point out echoes of other of his films in this one.  At the same time, it still manages to be quite suspenseful.Cary Grant was one of Hitchcock's favorite actors, and it's easy to see why; he lends a class and glamour to the film, yet allows himself to be put in all sorts of sticky situations which he is able to escape from, no matter how narrowly.  Eve Marie Saint is one of the best leading ladies he ever had, generating not only sex appeal but mystery.  Leo G. Carroll is quite good as The Professor, and I wonder if he was an inspiration for George Smiley.  Martin Landau is slimy as Leonard.  But besides Grant, the best performance here is by James Mason, who avoids going over-the-top to just ooze malice.  I especially liked his last line; ""Not very sporting, using real bullets.""  There are so many classic scenes it's hard to list them all, and Bernard Hermann's score is excellent as well.",North by Northwest

It was a real treat and I quickly caught myself enjoying every second of the movie and caring for the characters. Character of fatal blonde was done so many times to this day, but it's magnificent what Hitchcock does with it and how he really makes you care for the emotions of the characters. Nowadays, there are some things which stick out, but it can be forgiven given the time the movie was made. Overall, this movie is praised by a lot of people, but others give it less than 10/10 because the movie isn't as deep and thought provoking as other Hitchcock's movies. Well, I disagree there. It's a fun and enjoyable movie and even after more than 60 years it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat.

183,bat-5,Wonderful.,10,5 April 2001,"There are certain films in existance that you can watch over and over and they will always remain fresh and vibrant as the day they were released.  North By Northwest is one such film. Filled with the usual Hitchcock themes, the movie begins innocently enough when Roger Thornhill calls for a bell boy calling for a George Caplan.  From there, he's whisked into a world of murder, espionage, smuggling and late night romances aboard trains.  The suspense and plot build together as we, along with Thornhill, try to figure out what's happening, and try not to get killed along the way.  Among the films highlights is the infamous crop duster sequence, in which Hitchcock shows you that even in the middle of nowhere, there is still danger. Cary Grant is perfectly cast as the rather quick witted Roger O. Thornhill. Eva Marie Saint is the prerequisite blonde Eve Kendall who helps Thornhill in his quest.  The always wonderful James Mason is oily and sinister as Phillip Vandamm,  and Martin Landau hides a hidden menace behind his slightly crooked grin. Throw in a wonderful score from Bernard Herrmann, a top notch script from Ernest Lehman and masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, and you have a movie that you can never grow tired of.   Plus, you have to love that last shot.",North by Northwest
184,lagudafuad,One classic mystery that you must see,8,2 November 2012,"North by Northwest is an Alfred Hitchcock movie that is filled with twist and turns and counter twist that if you are not concentrating you will miss it all, it is known as one of his best mysteries.This classic 1959 American thriller film is directed by the mystery/thriller man himself Alfred Hitchcock. It was set to originally star James Stewart (Vertigo, Rear Window) as Thornhill, but as Hitchcock developed the script, he decided that Thornhill was more a Cary Grant type.The movie is based on a sixty page write up by a journalist named Guernsey. Hitchcock bought the write up for $ 10,000. He and Ernest Lehman worked on the script and Ernest Lehman further went ahead to develop the screenplay.What is so exceptional about this movie is that you never know what you will get or what's ahead; this movie will keep you guessing and wanting to see how it will end.The movie plot is centred on a man named George Kaplan. A certain Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) was mistaken for George Kaplan, and for that he was almost killed and spent the night in jail.Things took a turn for the worse when Roger could not prove to the police that he was kidnapped, drugged and was about to be killed. It didn't get any better when he became a murder suspect, for stabbing a man in the UN.Now Roger must find a way to prove his innocence and save the woman he loves.This movie is known for its scenes which have become popular, one of which is the cropdusting scene, where a Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canary chased Thornhill, that scene was named the best scene of all time in the August issue in 2009 of the British magazine Empire in their ""1001 Greatest Movie Moments"" of all time.The second popular scene is the shootout on Mount Rushmore at the end of the film which was filmed on a replica.The movie did introduce new trends, as fashion experts convened in the 2006 GQ rated the gray suit worn by Cary Grant throughout almost the entire film as the best suit in film history, and the most influential on men's style.The movie is ranked fourth in the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills, behind Psycho (1960), Jaws (1975) and The exorcist (1973). North by Northwest was nominated for three Academy Awards, which were Film Editing, Art Direction and Original Screenplay (Ernest Lehman) but lost it all to Ben Hur.This is a nice mystery, true and true one you will enjoy.www.lagsreviews.com",North by Northwest

Again, i cannot add anything which hasn't already been said, as this is a well loved classic. the set pieces that everyone knows are easily the best Hollywood produced before Bond, as are the double-entendres, and some of the dialouge is so sharp you have to rewind it to hear it again, write it down and wait for an opportunity to use it...Another film that it is difficult to find real fault with. 10 out of 10",North by Northwest

Purchased the DVD because it was rated so highly on IMDb and was on sale. Time hasn't deteriorated this gem too much, at least where it counted in the performances of Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint. This classy duo and their coming together seemed to be a Bond film in the making. And despite the espionage element, it was the humor and double entendre dialog that carried the action. The espionage in itself, didn't age well, but knowing the actors James Mason and Martin Landau, added some recognition excitement where the fake sets failed to stir a reaction. ""Roger...

192,Seamus2829,The Master Of Suspense At His Finest,10,6 November 2008,"If you've never had the pleasure of seeing an Alfred Hitchcock film (especially one of his best),this is the one for you to discover by the master of suspense,as he became widely known as. Cary Grant stars as a Madison Avenue executive who becomes a pawn by a spy organization,set up as a murder suspect,and skirts the country,hoping to find the answers to just why he's being set up. Toss in the requisite Hitchcock blonde beauty (Eva Marie Saint),and lots of plot twists, and you got yourself the formula for a white knuckled thriller. The film has some scenes that have become legendary,if not outright iconic (Grant being pursued by a crop duster airplane,the suspenseful scenes at Mount Rushmore,etc.). Hats off to musical director/composer, Bernard Hermann for crafting a music score that compliments the film nicely (as does his other musical scores for not just Hitchcock,but other films he wrote & arranged music for). The film is also a treat for the eye,filmed in the original Technicolor process & shot in the sadly now defunct 'Vistavision' process (another special wide screen process that Paramont seemed to have the copyright for,but allowed M-G-M to implement for this one film,only).

195,TheHonestCritic,Is this the best Alfred Hitchcock film? Check out my review below to find out!,10,3 November 2021,"""North by Northwest"" (1959), this was kind of a big surprise for me. For those who haven't been keeping track, I've reviewed over 200 movies so far, and I've never did one for an Alfred Hitchcock movie! I figured for my first Alfred Hitchcock film review, what better one to start off with than the first one of his movies I've seen? I first saw ""North by Northwest"" on TV when I was 7 or 8, I believe. When I first saw it, I was completely blown away! I haven't watched it that many times after that. But, I figured that I'd see it again before I wrote this review, so it would be fresh in my mind. Sure enough, it holds up brilliantly and I think it's even better than when I saw it for the first time! ""North by Northwest"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is, a New York City ad executive goes on the run after being mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies, and falls for a woman with questionable loyalties. The best way to define this story, is that it's simple, yet complex. For storylines such as this, that format is perfect. Being that this is a spy thriller, complexities on top of a simple plot is warranted, as it keeps the audience guessing and waiting in anticipation for what's going to happen next. ""North by Northwest"" has non-stop thrills and suspense in every scene. My personal favorite scene in this film is when Roger Thornhill, played by Cary Grant, is chased by the crop duster through the cornfields. Every time I see that part, it puts me on the edge of my seat. That's the mark of a great scene, if it thrills you the exact same way every time you watch it! I won't go into anymore details about the plot. But, I guarantee you that you'll be intrigued and invested all the way through from beginning to end. It may be over two hours long, but it goes by in a flash! As for the acting, it's just as fantastic as the storyline. Every single member of the cast nails their respectable characters, and then some! But, the shining star here has got to be Cary Grant as the main character, Roger Thornhill. His performance just adds to the excitement and you want to see him succeed in the end. The whole cast is phenomenal, and their on-screen chemistry is impeccable! All of the sets/locations are beautiful, and give the film a stunning atmosphere. The coolest thing is how much of it is shot on-location. It just makes the movie that much more memorable and a lot of fun to look at. I love when films shoot on-location, rather than in a studio and ""North by Northwest"" does an incredible job with that. There are a few scenes that are filmed in a studio. But, the balance between studio and location is executed so seamlessly, that it brings cohesive results. As far as the special effects go, they are very well-done, especially for it's time! They still hold up to this day. There are some here and there that do look a little aged, but at the end of the day, I still give them a pass. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Bernard Herrmann is exceptional and his film score sets the perfect tone for the story. ""North by Northwest"" is a top-notch spy thriller that fires on all cylinders. Alfred Hitchcock has made several great movies in his career! But, ""North by Northwest"" has got to by my all-time favorite one of his films. In my opinion, it's his magnum opus. It's one of those movies I can watch over and over and never get tired of it. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you're looking to get into Alfred Hitchcock films and don't know where to begin, start with this one, especially if you're a big fan of spy movies! I promise you that you'll be hooked and will want to check out more of his films. If you don't go see this movie, then you better watch out for the crop duster!",North by Northwest
196,zeekwunlau,Classics,8,26 April 2020,"The title of this film really defines the beauty and function of modern film titles:1. Integrate the film title in the form and the film itself (the early film titles only have the role of account and hint)The north-north-westerly opening title transitioned from an abstract grid background to a Manhattan building, and finally the impact focused on the crowd. This small paragraph itself is also a dismantling of the meaning of the building, that is, the conflict of people under the cross line.2. The first application of Kinetic Typography to movies (the text of the early movie titles is still)In the digital age, we have become accustomed to text animation. Personal computers can easily use AE to make cool effects. Films in the film age need to be realized with optical stunts.Saul Bass groundbreakingly made the opening text move up and down on the grid plane, and the text design merged with the grid, with a perspective effect, which took another big step for the opening text design.The most impressive is the scene of the plane chasing the male host and the final scene of fighting on the presidential hill. In the last scene, the male host takes the female host's hand, and the next second shot is on the train! (The hint that the train enters the hole is also absolute!However, the details are still very obvious.

With its dense script, perfect pacing, and sophisticated direction, ""North by Northwest"" is the synthesis of Hitch's style up to that point. It puts together most of his usual tropes: an ordinary person getting involved in a crime, mistaken identity, MacGuffins, alcohol, inept policemen, witty humor, a mysterious blonde, etc. In a way, it's also a precursor to the James Bond movies. Things get a bit too silly at times, but nothing we can't forgive if we consider the overall playful tone.I know it's not uncommon for old films, but the actress playing Cary Grant's mother was just a few years older than him.

198,Quicksand,"I'm Not a Hitchcock Fan, but this I like",10,16 August 2001,"After years of recommendation, I finally watched NXNW.  Over the years I have seen four other Hitchcock films-- ""Psycho"" (it felt 30 minutes too long), ""Rear Window"" (it felt at LEAST 30 minutes too long), ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (loved it), and ""Vertigo"" (2 hours, felt like it was six).  After a track record like that, I began to think that either a) Years of watching films from the 1980's and -90's has ruined me, or b) Hitchcock isn't nearly as brilliant as some people seem to think he is.  Turns out-- big surprise-- it's a mixture of both.""Vertigo"" was very stylish (in parts), but I don't think it holds up, as the story is told much too slowly to make me care.  With ""North by Northwest"" I was pulled in right from the very beginning-- the writing was wonderful. Plot structure and many of the one-liners were too much fun to watch and hear, and with the exception of some cleverly-used 1959 special effects, this screenplay could be remade today, as written, if only because Cary Grant can't open a film anymore (although with a script this great, it wouldn't really matter who the lead was).Whereas I marveled at screenwriter Lehman's work every few minutes, and Hitchcock's work only every 30 minutes or so, this is still an extremely watchable film and I loved every second of it.  It's almost enough to finally make me a Hitchcock fan... but I think I'll check out some Lehman films first.",North by Northwest
199,disinterested_spectator,Fridge Logic,9,24 November 2014,"Roger Thornhill is an everyman who gets mistaken for George Kaplan, an American spy, by a couple of foreign spies. He escapes from them, but in the process of trying to figure out what is going on, ends up being accused of murdering a United Nations diplomat named Townsend. Now the police are after him as well as the spies. Then we find out that there is no spy named Kaplan. He is the creation of an intelligence agency for the purpose of keeping the foreign spies from suspecting the real agent on the case. That agent proves to be Eve Kendall, the mistress of the chief spy, Phillip Vandamm. She and Roger fall in love, but out of necessity she betrays him. When he finds out she is a good spy and is in danger, he rescues her.Hitchcock is said to have formulated the principle of ""fridge logic"": if there is an inconsistency or absurdity in a movie, but you do not realize it until you get home and are looking in the refrigerator for a snack, then the inconsistency or absurdity does not matter, because you have already enjoyed the movie. This movie exemplifies that principle like no other movie ever made. The first time we watch the movie, we experience it from the Roger's point of view. Although there are a couple of scenes that we see where Roger is not present, giving us a little extra information, we are pretty much in the dark about things just as he is.But once you have seen the entire movie, it becomes possible to look at his situation objectively, or rather, from the point of view of the foreign spies. And that is when you realize that the movie makes no sense whatsoever. First of all, there is no reason why Vandamm would pretend to be a United Nations diplomat. After all, if Roger were a spy named Kaplan, he would know he was talking to Vandamm and not Townsend. So who is Vandamm trying to fool?Second, when Roger escapes, he comes back the next day with the local police, and a woman pretending to be Mrs. Townsend is fully prepared for this, pretending that Roger just got a little intoxicated and is confused about what happened the night before. Now, if Roger were a real spy named Kaplan, he would not have come back with the local police. If he came back at all, it would be with the F.B.I., and they would not doubt his story. More likely, Kaplan would simply report back to his superiors that the spies knew who he was and ask for directions on how to proceed.Third, after leaving the train, where Roger and Eve have met and spent the night together, he asks her to call Kaplan for him (he thinks he knows the hotel where Kaplan would be staying). She goes to a phone booth and starts talking to someone. In another phone booth, we see Leonard, one of the spies, whom she is apparently talking to. We do not hear what they are saying. When she comes out of the booth, she tells Roger where he can meet Kaplan.Just prior to filming the phone booth scene, Hitchcock shut down the filming for three days. He said that he was bothered by the fact that Eve would not have known the phone number of the booth Leonard was in, but he decided to let it go. That was not the reason. The problem is that what takes place in the phone booths is an impossible conversation, but since no one else on the set seemed to have realized this, he figured he could get away with it. To see this, we have to keep in mind that Roger does not know Eve is a spy. Furthermore, he believes Kaplan exists and wants to talk to him. Leonard, on the other hand, thinks Roger is Kaplan. And Eve knows that there is no Kaplan. Let's try a possible conversation:Eve: He says he wants me to call Kaplan and arrange a meeting.Leonard: What are you talking about? He is Kaplan.Eve: But that's what he says.Leonard: I guess he is on to you. After all, a spy like Kaplan, who has been following Vandamm for months, would know that you are Vandamm's mistress.Eve: So, what shall I do?Leonard: Tell Kaplan you talked to Kaplan, and that Kaplan wants to meet him to meet him in the middle of an open prairie. I know that doesn't make sense, but do it anyway.Not only does that not make sense, but if Roger really were a spy named Kaplan, he would not want to meet anyone. And if he did want to meet someone, he would not agree to meet him alone and in the middle of nowhere. Only if Roger is who he says he is would he believe that Eve talked to Kaplan and that Kaplan wants to meet him. In other words, when Roger gets off the bus at Prairie Stop, the spies should realize at that point that he really is Roger Thornhill, because the real Kaplan would not have done that.And thus we have the greatest example of fridge logic ever. The first time you see the movie, you likely will think it is one of the finest that Hitchcock ever produced. But with each subsequent viewing, the illogical behavior of the spies becomes increasingly evident, until it becomes almost unwatchable.",North by Northwest
200,brenttraft,One of the All Time Greats!,10,18 February 2006,"""North By Northwest"" is one of my all times favorites. It has romance, international intrigue, and comedy. It has a little something for everybody.This is a story of a mild mannered advertising executive who is mistaken for an international spy.

201,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Cary Grant steals the show,9,7 February 2020,"""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchcock's best movies. A funny, adventure-filled thriller about an advertisement executive, played by Cary Grant, who is mistaken for a government agent by some powerful unscrupulous characters and kidnapped. Eventually framed for murder then, he goes on the run, with the police, FBI and the criminals whom he has invariably crossed all hot on his tail. Cary Grant is fantastic. He delivers so many witty and sarcastic lines throughout the film, one of my favourites being ""I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives and several bartenders that depend upon me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed."" He was in good shape in this for a man over fifty. Hitchcock's direction is evident and as powerful as it ever was; the Mount Rushmore scenes are highly applaudable and were a fitting backdrop for a story that took us to many places and mad scenarios. Ernest Lehman is the one we have to thank for the story and script. Grant, Hitchcock and Lehman's work together help ensure that ""North by Northwest"" maintains a perfect balance between serious, high-octane thriller and comedy.""Something wrong with your eyes?""

The normal Blu-ray release packages the disc in the standard blue plastic case. The 50th Anniversary Edition packages the disk in an attractive Blu-ray book format. This special edition has an extremely classy presentation and is priced at an estimated ten dollars higher than the regular release. It is slightly skimpy in actual content, but one must admit that its 44 pages are beautifully rendered.ImageImageImageImageThe film begins playing when the disc is put into the player, but Warner Brothers does offer a menu that can be accessed at any time.ImageThe menu itself is rather soft and grainy and does not hint at the quality of the actual film's visual presentation on the disc.NBNW (1)Picture Quality:5 of 5 MacGuffinsIt might not be possible to adequately put into words just how amazing this 8K restoration transfer looks in high definition. Warner Brothers should be proud of this release and Hitchcock fans and anyone else who has a love for classic cinema should feel lucky to own it. The level of detail in this high definition transfer is truly astonishing. This film looks better than a few of the transfers of more recent films I have seen. The studio spared no expense on bringing us a fantastic picture.down shotThe picture is presented in an aspect ratio of 1.78:1 and is actually closer to the original 1.66:1 VistaVision ratio than the film's original DVD release. The color on this transfer seems richer and more cinematic. I would imagine that this is very similar to how the image looked in the cinemas. There seems to be absolutely no print damage. This might not be quite as sharp as a more recent film, but I can assure you that North by Northwest has never looked sharper than it does in this release. Even more amazingly, this seems to have been achieved without the use of any artificial edge enhancement. There is an appropriate amount of grain for a film of this era, but it is an extremely clean image. It is simply gorgeous.Cary and EveSound Quality:4 of 5 MacGuffinsPurists might find fault with the sound options on this release. A TrueHD 5.1 audio mix has been created for this release and the disc does not seem to contain its original soundtrack. It is unfortunate that this track is not included in addition to this new 5.1 high definition mix, but I have no complaints about this new mix. It is a modest remix that retains the essence of the original soundtrack. It is mixed at a low volume and it might become necessary to raise the volume on your television set, but it is a very nice experience. Dialogue is consistently clear and well prioritized. It is delivered mainly through the center channels but has presence in the left and right speakers as well. Bernard Herrmann's fabulous score has never sounded better than it is presented here and there are some wonderful panning effects during the crop dusting sequence that enhance the viewing experience without going overboard. This is a subtle mix that suits the film nicely.iconic cornfieldSpecial Features:5 of 5 MacGuffinsWarner Brothers offers a rather fabulous selection of special features. Even contemporary films rarely receive so many excellent features on home video. Many of these selections might have been preferable in high definition and included on a second disc (although a few of these features are likely from standard definition sources). However, this is only a small complaint.Cary in CornCommentary Track with Scriptwriter Ernest LehmanThis is an extremely interesting commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman. It is slightly slow getting started, but it contains a wealth of information that fans of the film will consider priceless. Some of the most fascinating moments of the commentary have less to do with factual information and a bit more to do with ego and conceit. There are moments in the film where the writer seems almost bitter that he has not received more credit for the film's success. This was recorded for original DVD release years ago and anyone who owns any of the DVD versions of the film will have heard it already.Isolated Bernard Herrmann Music TrackThis feature is essential for anyone who would like to experience Herrmann's score for North by Northwest without the distraction of other elements of the soundtrack. It illuminates Herrmann's profound contribution to the film perfectly. This track is a carry over from the original DVD release of the film.""Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest"" - (00:39:27) - (480P NTSC)This is a wonderful ""Making of"" documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. It is fairly comprehensive and always interesting. This feature is another carry over from the film's original DVD release.""North by Northwest: One for the Ages"" - (00:25:29) - (480P NTSC)Contemporary directors and scholars discuss North by Northwest giving their impressions of the film along with a few details about production and where the film fits into the Hitchcock canon as a whole. This is the weakest of the documentaries on the disc, but it is consistently enjoyable and interesting.""The Master's Touch: Hitchcock's Signature Style"" - (00:57:52) - (480P NTSC)This documentary utilizes interesting footage from a documentary made in the 1970s of Hitchcock himself discussing his methods. Even better, we see a few behind the scenes moments of the director shooting ""Blackmail."" Contemporary directors also appear to discuss Hitchcock's style and technique as film clips illustrate what the participants are saying. It is an interesting addition to the disc.""Cary Grant: A Class Apart"" - (01:27:12) - (480P NTSC)This feature length documentary on Cary Grant is surprisingly wonderful and fairly comprehensive. It does not ignore some of the more controversial aspects of Grant's life (although it has a tendency to play them down) and it discusses his career in more detail than some of the other documentaries available about the actor. It is consistently interesting and a welcome addition to this release. Many are likely to prefer this feature over all of the others on the disc.",North by Northwest
203,Eternality,"With this film, Hitchcock has nearly perfected one of the fundamentals of thrillers - the picaresque pursuit.",9,15 April 2011,"What would it be like if Hitchcock stop directing suspense dramas and work on a purely escapist flick? The answer is North By Northwest. The most entertaining motion picture ever made by the legendary filmmaker, North By Northwest has an immense influence on 'Hollywood chase films', making them significant fixtures in contemporary cinema, from The Fugitive to the Bourne trilogy. Nominated for three Oscars including Best Original Screenplay, this film ranks almost as highly as three of the director's greatest critical achievements - Vertigo, Rear Window, and Psycho. North By Northwest stars Cary Grant (The Philadelphia Story, Notorious) in a role that was written for James Stewart (It's A Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington) whom Hitchcock claimed was too old for the role (ironically, Grant was four years older leading to rumors of a professional dispute between Hitchcock and Stewart). In less than five minutes, Hitchcock remarkably establishes the plot and paints Grant's character, Roger, as a well-dressed but fiercely sarcastic man with a strong sense of self-respect and integrity. It does not take long for viewers to get acquainted with him, who plummets from one perplexing situation to another as he tries to make sense of what is going on. By chance, he meets an icy-cold blond, Eve (played by Eva Marie Saint) whose motives appear suspect. In a world of deceit and treachery, who is there to trust? North By Northwest is as much a comedy as a mystery-thriller. Its screenplay is a delightful blend of dark humor (most of the hilarious lines are uttered by Grant) and cliffhanger moments. Speaking of which, the film contains two of Hitchcock's most celebrated set-pieces - the tense crop dusting sequence, and the final Mount Rushmore climax. The pacing is just right except for an abrupt jump-cut scene at the end which makes the aforementioned climax a little short-lived. With this film, Hitchcock has nearly perfected one of the fundamentals of thrillers - the picaresque pursuit. Recommended!

204,rollernerd,That crop scene...,8,16 April 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's Hitchcock movie review Is North By Northwest (1959), an action thriller where we the story has the same elements as previous Hitchcock flicks - an advertising executive gets mixed up as a wrong man and soon is accused of a crime he did not commit. This New York executive is Roger Thornhill, played brilliantly by the suave Cary Grant. Thornhill is pursued by a pack of thugs after he is mistaken for a government agent spy known as George Kaplan and we movie goers found ourselves on a cross-country journey. But the question begins on who really is Kaplan and maybe Thornhill is Kaplan?The story of the movie is smart by keeping you on the edge, constantly giving us guessing games yet provides you a few answers here and there in a timely fashion while providing you a comic, adventure-caper type flick. And that is what Hitchcock does very well in this entertaining suspenseful flick, he balances out between seriousness and silliness. All this is largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant who not just plays your everyday man but also gives you his trademark jerky movements and exasperated facial expressions. Whether Grant is forced drunk and driving a car to get away from the goons while trying to avoid driving over the cliff's edge, or his expression when his mother asks the would-be assassin whether they want to kill his son which leads to the other people in the lift laughing hysterical - you see his expressions that summarises the film's atmosphere while beginning to question whether this bloke is who he says he is. It flirts with the idea of identity.The plot's MacGuffin allows the Thornhill to move seamlessly across iconic American landscapes by means of plane, train and automobile. There are so many great and iconic scenes in this film - the crop duster chase of course and also those at the United Nations and Mount Rushmore. Coming to the that crop duster scene...before this scene we see a man who comes across as slightly clumsy and under his mother's thumb, but he evolves once it is clear that he's been marked and is a target for a sinister plot. So what happens? He becomes more assertive in taking matters into his own hands.The crop duster scene...have to chat about it folks. As soon as Thornhill is off the bus, stood in the middle of nowhere, the music stops. The audience is alone with him in the vast space of this landscape which is in the middle of no where, which is a clever decision made by Hitchcock as it effectively boxes the character in with four shots; an invisible wall. And then you have the crop duster plane...what happens is a game of cat-and-mouse. When the plane turns its attentions towards him and attack and when Grant turns to the camera with the stuttered movements, you see his survival instinct kicking in is one of Hitchcock's strongest moments. Grant's performance is perfect in his change of running style. Throughout the film, his run has still been comedic, lanky, wide-eyed. Here it is an expression of bare-faced fear as he runs and takes brief cover in a crop. I wont tell you what happens next but wow oh wow.Another great element in this flick is Hitch's musical maestro partner, Bernard Herrmann whose score drives the flick's constant momentum. Smart as it reflects the tone of the flick. The femme fatale played by Eva Marie Sant is performed brilliantly as this alluring woman with a dubious and enigmatic nature - again you question who is she really?? I could literally chat about this flick on and on - do yourself a favour a have a crack, overall 8.5/10.",North by Northwest
205,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Hitchcock's Best Film,10,20 November 2006,"SPOILERSThis a great Hitchock film. It is actually my favorite Hitchcock film.A man named Roger Thornhill is taken by two men to a house owned by a man named Lester Townsend. At the house Lester Townsend, who is really a man named Phillip Vandamn, tells him that he's really a man named George Kaplan. Thornhill says he isn't Kaplan and Townsend becomes very angry. Townsend's men force Thornhill to drink a bottle of bourbon. When he is drunk they put him in a stolen car and drive it next to a cliff. It appears to look like an accident. Thornhill drives down the road but is arrested.The next day he tries to tell the police and his mother that they forced bourbon down his throat. They obviously don't believe him. To make matters worse, the police go to Townsend's house and a woman who is supposed to be Townsend's wife says that Townsend's a United Nations diplomat.Thornhill tries to find this so called George Kaplan. He goes to Kaplan's hotel room in which he finds a photograph. Thornhill gets a taxi and goes to the General Assembly building. Townsend is supposed to give a speech there. Thornhill asks to speak to Townsend the man who comes is not the man at the house. Thornhill shows Townsend the photograph that he had gotten. At that same moment one of the fake Townsend's accomplices throws a knife into Townsend's back. He dies. Thornhill takes the knife out of his back, which means people think he killed the real Townsend. He runs for his life. Thornhill gets on a train heading to Chicago. There he meets Eve Kendall. She helps him avoid the police. When they get to Chicago Eve finds one of Vandamn's accomplices. Eve just happens to be Vandamn's girlfriend.

The people look at the explosion while Thornhill steals their car. He goes back to a hotel. Kaplan is supposed to have a room. He checked out. He visits Eve's room. She tells him to stay away from him. When she leaves for a meeting Thornhill finds out that she is going to a art auction. At the auction Thornhill encounters Vandamn. Vandamn gets a Himalayan statue. He still thinks he is George Kaplan. Thornhill tries to leave, but Vandamn's accomplices won't let him. Thornhill makes a scene on purpose, to avoid capture. He is arrested. In the cop car he says that he killed Townsend. The cops take him to an airport. At the airport Thornhill meets The Professor. He says that George Kaplan never existed. He made it up to entrap Vandamn. He tells Thornhill to help him with his agency to help get Vandamn. Vandamn is smuggling microfilmed secrets out of the country. He also says that Eve is in danger because of Thornhill. At a cafeteria at Mount Rushmore Thornhill meets Eve and Vandamn. Thornhill tells Vandamn to leave the country for Eve. He refuses. Eve shoots Thornhill. She leaves and so does Vandamn.Thornhill is taken away by a stretcher in a car. The car is taken into a forest. Thornhill comes out of it, unharmed. He talks to Eve. The bullets in the gun were blanks. Eve then says she wants to go with Vandamn to get more information. Then the driver knocks Thornhill out.Thornhill wakes up in a hospital. His door is locked. He asks the Professor to get a bottle of Bourban. He goes out the door. Then Thornhill goes out the window. Thornhill goes to Vandamn's house by Mount Rushmore. He gets in the house. He overhears that one of Vandamn's accomplices found out that Eve had blanks. Vandamn then wants to throw Eve out of the plane window. Thornhill tells Eve that. When she is going to board the plane, she gets the microfilm and runs. Thornhill joins her. They go across the faces of Mount Rushmore. Vandamn dies. Eve then is knocked by Vandamn's accomplice named Leonard. Eve clings to the edge of Mount Rushmore. Leonard dies and Thornhill pulls Eve up. The film ends with Thornhill and Eve's honeymoon.

206,tcchelsey,"ARGUEABLY, HITCHCOCK'S BEST EFFORT",10,10 January 2021,"There's a heck of a lot of debate over NORTH BY NORTHWEST as to where it stands among Hitchcock's greatest films. To tell you the truth, it has to be at the very top of the list, if not the first. There are innumerable classic scenes in this one that have gone to be Hollywood lore and will undoubtedly live on forever. One gem of a movie that without question was meticulously assembled and cast by the master of suspense, an inspiration to present and future film makers hands down. The best thing about any of Hitchcock's productions is the storyline, generally pitting the main character against all odds and just watching what happens to them. In this case, Cary Grant is mistaken, and rather simply, if not humorously, as a gent who some nefarious spies are very much interested in. The rest is up to him to prove otherwise and hopefully survive his ordeal. Black comedy at its best with some excellent characters to give him a run for his money, including James Mason as his unrelenting adversary, and the lovely Eva Marie Saint as the ""mystery woman"" with a few skeletons in her own closet, and perhaps needing him more than he needs her. It gets complicated, but that's the genius of Hitchcock that we all will always remember. Notably, there are always some delicious smaller roles that are navigated by some fine actors. Case in point, Jessie Royce Landis as Grant's wise-cracking mom, still treating him as if he were in high school, Martin Landau as a cold-blooded associate of Mason's (who you know is going to get his one way or another) and Leo G. Carroll as the man with an exit strategy. After decades of watching this adventure, the cornfield chase scene remains a knockout and one you never ever get tired of, particularly Grant's arrival, stepping off a bus in the middle of nowhere. Hitchcock got it just right and that about sums up this whole neat adventure. One for the books and, yes, debatable as to whether it's Hitch's number one or number two, but let the record show that this is what a film classic should be, from beginning to end.",North by Northwest
207,ssssgelojun,North by Nor thwest,7,14 August 2020,"The main thrust of the film is a deep understanding of the moral relativism and intrigue of the Cold War. But the biggest significance is that Hitchcock's film from this point on is different from his earlier works only around a suspense operation, but began to use multiple layers of suspense transformation and superposition to structure the development of the same story.At the same time, the humorous, relaxed, rich erotic style and comic temperament of the film is also an attempt by Hitchcock to distinguish himself from other works.From today's perspective, in addition to the suspenseful layers of stripping and reversing and beautiful photography, the plot of the silly and logical details of the loopholes are really regrettable.",North by Northwest
208,michaelradny,Up And Upwest,9,20 October 2015,"Alfred Hitchcock dished something up more then fifty years ago that would change the way cinema looked today. North By Northwest was that film, and whilst at the time I can only imagine it was fantastical, it still holds up today, trumping most films that come out in the twenty first century. It's fast paced action, it's mystery and twists and turns and all the charm from its actors are what carry this film into cinematic history. North By Northwest is one of the greatest films ever made, both for its historic placement and it's utterly great story. It proves to be something more then a film, it's more of an adventure for the audience; we travel with Roger through this fantastic thriller, becoming apart of his venture. Possibly the greatest action adventure film ever made.",North by Northwest

This film reminded me of the type of summer blockbuster that is released every summer -- minus the special effects.

See this movie and prepare to be awed.",North by Northwest
210,bwaynef,"Hitchcock's ""blue"" movie",10,7 April 1999,"Picasso had his ""blue"" period, and blue figured prominently in some of Elvis Presley's recordings (""Blue Moon,"" ""Blue Moon of Kentucky,"" ""A Mess of Blues,"" ""Moody Blue,"" and so on).  But I don't recall hearing much about Alfred Hitchcock's blue period.  Yet, the great director's ""North by Northwest"" is awash in that color, so much so that it must have been a deliberate, and, therefore, significant move.Blue, and a rather unattractive pale shade of it at that, is everywhere in ""North by Northwest,"" so damn prominent that I found myself annoyed when watching what was once one of my favorite films on video.  Yes, there was so much blue that ""North by Northwest"" may not be one of my favorite films for long.  Blue, especially that pale shade, is not my favorite color.  But there's Cary Grant in a pale blue suit; the interior of the train he boards when fleeing the police is blue; the sky, of course, is blue; and, well, there just seems to be blue--that sickening pale blue--everywhere.  What was Hitchcock thinking?  The master of suspense was famous for planning his films down to the smallest detail, so unless I saw a bad video transfer, he must have had a reason for emphasizing that color.Well, ""North by Northwest"" is still one of Hitchcock's greatest films, although what stands out after repeated viewings is not that crop duster scene, or the escape from enemy agents across the faces of Mount Rushmore, or the naughty image at the conclusion, but the music:  Bernard Herrmann's score is one of the composer's most thrilling and unforgettable works.I must say that after my most recent encounter with the blue hues of ""North by Northwest,"" I appreciate all the more the fact that Hitchcock made his next film (""Psycho,"" of course) in black-and-white.",North by Northwest

214,Gubby-Allen,Great Hitchcock,8,5 March 2002,"Probably my favourite of the Hitchcock films I've seen to date, over Psycho, Dial M & Vertigo.Cary Grant's just brilliant as Roger. One of the most convincing & faultless pieces of acting you'll ever see, superior to James Stewart, in Hitchcock roles.I had problems with the casting though, not the acting or characters, they were all brilliant, but Cary was 54 when this was made, by my reckoning, yet played someone half that age, his Mum was a few months younger than him & Eve seemed far older than the character she played, which she was.
Ignoring Cary Grant's grey hair which slightly belittled his role & two or three aspects of criminal behaviour which don't really hold up in today's world, (why didn't the villains drive past in a car & shoot rather than a plane?) and a story dragged on 10 or 15 minutes too long, it's still a pretty awesome film with the usual superb acting, music & cinematography you expect from Hitchcock, but also with some amusing humour thrown in.8/10",North by Northwest

216,basrutten,The master of suspense forgot to put the suspense in,7,28 November 2006,"The ""old"" movies in the Top-250 seem to me to fall squarely into two categories: true classics (Vertigo, Casablanca), and movies that are probably mostly included for nostalgic reasons and have aged quite noticeably. ""North by Northwest"" falls clearly into the second category. While it's by no means a bad movie, it's also by no means a real classic.""North by Northwest"" can best be described as a very early attempt at an action comedy. It's a fast-paced, fairly light story that clearly goes for style over substance. As such, it succeeds gloriously. There's no denying that it's a very charming movie. The lead characters are excellent, the dialog is sharp, witty, and full of memorably quotes, and some scenes like the auction are truly classic. Kudos also to the excellent musical score.Yet, I was expecting a bit more from Hitchcock. For one, ""North by Northwest"" is sorely lacking in suspense. Although the main characters are constantly chased and put into supposedly hazardous situations, but they always get away easily and never seem to be in any real danger, thus killing most of the suspense.The plot also doesn't really help. It's got its fair share of twists and turns, but most of them are so predictable that you can spot them from a mile away, and curiously enough most of the mystery is revealed early on, further killing any suspense that might have been there. Also, expect a fair amount of plot holes, contrivances, and a very clear deus ex machina ending. The relatively complexity of the plot might have wowed audiences one day, but not any more.""North by Northwest"" is perfect as a light-hearted diversion, but I have trouble seeing this as the classic it is often proclaimed to be.***1/2 out of *****",North by Northwest

Cary Grant's protagonist may be an unwilling spy, but he is a natural one, bantering confidently with baddies in posh hotels and doggedly courting a mysterious femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint). The crop duster scene is perhaps the best and most iconic action sequence that Hitchcock ever filmed. James Mason makes an ideal antagonist, dwelling in a Bond-villain-style lodge atop a famous U.S. landmark. Twists and triple-crosses make for an exciting, complex tale.",North by Northwest
218,frankwiener,Mr. Thornhill's Thorny Ordeal,9,1 January 2018,"Wedged between the making of two very serious, psychological suspense films, ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", director Alfred Hitchcock created a very different kind of thriller, one consisting largely of comedy, both subtle and obvious, thanks in part to the talent of scriptwriter, Ernest Lehman. Hitchcock and Lehman started with three seemingly unrelated ideas, (1) a mistaken identity, (2) a chase scene through the United Nations, and (3) a spectacular finale at Mount Rushmore. They then wove these three events into one cohesive story, a fascinating creative process by itself.As to the acting, I have seen Cary Grant in many movies, including a number of mediocre items and even worse than that, but he provides the perfect Roger Thornhill with his dry, natural wit and suave, elegant appearance. Whenever I am faced with life's adversities, I only need to recall how Roger would approach the situation with his coolness and muted sense of humor. The fact that Grant did not understand Lehman's script only authenticates his genuine state of confusion as he is pursued from New York City to Rapid City, South Dakota by way of Chicago and some very dry Indiana cornfields. As the mysterious Eve Kendall, Eva Marie Saint is a very different woman indeed from her Oscar winning performance as Edie Doyle in ""On the Waterfront"", and she never ceases to intrigue us as a woman who is far more independent and sexually assertive than we would normally expect in 1959. And who could deliver those caustic, cynical lines as well as James Mason in the part of the deceptively ""respectable"" villain, Philip van Damm? Grant and Mason are an outstanding match, and they bring this film to a high level (no pun intended when you consider the ending) that it may not have achieved without their dynamic interaction.Throughout the film, subtle undercurrents flow beneath the surface, including Thornhill's curious relationship with his undermining mother (Jesse Royce Landis), which may by itself explain his previous two divorces. Then there is the quirky jealousy of van Damm's assistant thug, Leonard (Martin Landau). When I first viewed this film at the innocent age of ten, I didn't appreciate the symbolism of the speeding train through the tunnel at the end, but I was nevertheless very impressed by the overall visual power created by Hitchcock, not only here but in many of his other productions as well.There were many memorable cinematic moments in this film, including an extraordinary aerial shot of Thornhill escaping from the United Nations building, a sudden showdown involving a man, a speeding oil tanker, and a menacing crop duster, and several, breathtaking shots from atop Mount Rushmore, both real and manufactured. As was the case with the Statue of Liberty in ""Saboteur"", the power of the monument is enhanced even more by the director's dramatic camera angles as it stands as an invincible symbol of the freedom that the evil elements in the film want to destroy.The success of ""North By Northwest"" is shaped by a combination of winning attributes, including a very gifted director, a sharp, snappy screenplay by Lehman, superb cinematography by Robert Burks, an effectively moody musical score by Bernard Hermann, and some first-rate acting.",North by Northwest
219,ldavis-2,"Sorry to be a party pooper, but...",4,20 April 2003,"it's never explained how Vandamm was able to use the estate without poor Mr. Townsend's knowledge.

In his quest to rectify the case of mistaken identity, Thornhill assumes Kaplan's name and all but uses his credit cards? THAT makes no sense! Eve deliberately sends Thornhill off to his doom (the crop-dusting scene), yet a few minutes in her hotel room, and - after some barbs at the auction - all is forgiven? Give me a break!Hitchcock never could shoot mattes or studio ""action"" so they don't distract the viewer, made worse by the inconsistency in his exteriors (Eve at the plane was clearly shot in broad daylight, even though it's supposed to be late night.) And the Mt. Rushmore sets are so phony-looking. The script repeats information: Thornhill proposes to Eve as they cling to Mt. Rushmore, then calls her ""Mrs. Thornhill"" as he pulls her up a few minutes later. And Thornhill allowing two thugs to muscle him out of a crowded restaurant without so much as a struggle?

220,krational66,The Great Alfred Hitchcock,8,23 April 2020,"I was patient enough to see the 136-minute North By Northwest. I expected it to be a little boring. It was an old 1959 movie. However, as The opening music progressed, I began to realize that this film must be worthy of his title of The Master of Suspense. Sure enough, I sank in slowly, like a sponge. Oh, no, it's a bounce bed. It's thrilling and fascinating.I want to admire this work which has integrated almost all shooting techniques, one unit continuous and jump.Close up!The lead actor, Cary Grant, is often seen in close-up. He has a handsome edge. So you see particularly for him, in the play of Roger's encounter and worried, a Russian spy targeted, was mistaken for an FBI member, is actually not there, the intelligence agency coined the ""Mr.Medium shotUsually in Hollywood movies, men are shot in this way. Oh, the mid-shot stays on the waist, which makes the man in the camera appear larger.Medium long shotSeveral gentlemen were talking in the bar with the picture frame above their knees. It has the same meaning as a medium shot.POV shotIt's a wonderful scene where the hero is drinking and driving after being given a big drink of bourbon. We could only see through his eyes in the headlights. The black water lapping against the shore reef, the extremely narrow coastal road, the oncoming cars, the enemy following behind, created a scene of horror. For fear that an accident might happen if he was not careful. Our hearts are gripped by Hitchcock's subjective lens.It is interesting to note that the heroine Eve is often presented with a glance from Roger. So implicit and secret. Blonde, delicate cloud dress, such a distinctive female body is also a trick to catch the eye of the audience.Shot/reverse shotPositive and negative shots are used in conversations between two people. Roger&Eve had a good time talking over dinner in the train car. This kind of technique builds sweet atmosphere for them namely.

221,PetarNeo,Incredible piece,10,14 December 2016,Man gets mistaken for another guy finding himself in difficult situation but that didn't stop him in his pursuit for truth and love. Once more Alfred brings us a masterfully dramatic movie with so much great moments and many twists and turnouts of events that pushed limits of movie. Roger managed to survive attempts on his life and now goes through extremely hard times maintaining pace with guys that want to kill him. On his journey he encounters women that is mysterious but has some unspoken intentions and every scene with Eve and Roger was quite charming. Now they have fallen in love but she's a secret agent that is spying on Vandamm but Roger is persistent in getting to Eve. Thereafter Roger now went through all kind of events and faking but everything that he was doing payed of when he found himself in situation where he was saving Eve. Roger and Eve are now driving again in train and movie ends in place where they met each other. It was very powerful and tricky picture with some serious and incredible action scene but also deeply romantic and quite pretty. Cary Grant who played Roger was great with his charm and determination in finding truth but also very emotional performance. Eva Marie Saint was Eve and she was extremely loving character with so much emotions and passion. James Mason as Vandamm was very calm but gave dangerous and dark view on his character. 3.5/4,North by Northwest
222,HelloTexas11,tremendously entertaining,10,26 May 2008,"I'm something of a latecomer to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. For some inexplicable reason, I had it in my head for years that I wouldn't enjoy most of his work. Even sillier is the fact that the two Hitchcock films I HAD seen, 'Psycho' and 'The Birds,' were two of my favorite movies ever. Go figure. A few years ago, I rented two of his lesser offerings, 'Rope' and 'Marnie,' which seemed to confirm my suspicions. (Loved the giant backdrop of the battleship at the end of 'Marnie,' though.) Then this year, I have watched three bona fide Hitchcock classics- 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' (both commented on elsewhere) and last night, 'North by Northwest.' Need I even point out that I am now a full-fledged Hitchcock devotee and am really looking forward to seeing the rest of his catalogue. As with 'Vertigo' and 'Rear Window,' I had no preconceptions about 'North by Northwest' and it, like those other two, took me very much by surprise. It is an almost perfect blend of thriller and comedy, neither aspect overwhelming the other. In fact, they compliment each other beautifully. A favorite Hitchcockian theme is the misunderstood main character, in this case Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill (the 'O' doesn't stand for anything), and there has probably never been a more misunderstood character in the Hitchcock canon, maybe in all of cinema. Through the most casual mistake imaginable, a group of foreign spies come to believe Thornhill is actually George Kaplan, an American secret agent on their tail. Naturally, Thornhill's protestations to them (after they abduct him) that he is not Kaplan only serve to reinforce their conviction that he is hiding his true identity by pretending to adopt another. It would be an understatement to say Thornhill's life is never the same from that point on. James Mason and a very young Martin Landau portray the foreign (Soviet?) spies and they are perfect choices for their roles. Mason's character, Phillip Vandamm, reminds me quite a lot of one he would play over twenty years later, the defense attorney in 'The Verdict.' Both are well-spoken, quietly threatening, and absolutely cold-blooded while appearing very mannered and reasonable. Nobody does this type of role as well as Mason. After a point, it is revealed that in fact, there is no government agent named George Kaplan. He is a purely fictitious character created by US intelligence to provide cover for another, flesh and blood agent working the case. Thornhill accidentally and unintentionally being mistaken for Kaplan provides the US agency both risks and opportunities; in any event, they are not at all inclined to come to Thornhill's aid and clear him as that would endanger the real agent. Yes, it's complicated and I'm even leaving a lot of stuff out! The head of the intelligence unit, 'The Professor,' is wonderfully underplayed by reliable old Leo G. Carroll. Nothing surprises The Professor anymore, everything the agency does makes perfect sense... this is a man who long ago resigned himself to doing whatever is necessary to achieve, well, whatever is necessary. Because there's nothing else you can do, really. Carroll's conversations with Grant are priceless. The final piece in this convoluted puzzle is a strange woman named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) who Thornhill meets on a train as he tries to evade both the spies and the police. Eve helps him and for a while her motivation is unclear; it seems as though she may just be a thrill-seeker who likes living dangerously by picking up strange men. There are some wonderfully provocative exchanges between her and Thornhill; I suspect these are about as far as a mainstream Hollywood film could go in 1959 but aside from that, they are beautifully written by Ernest Lehman and just as well-acted by Grant and Saint. There is a real chemistry between them and... what's the old saying? 'Sparks fly?' Cary Grant himself seems like an odd choice to play Thornhill. With his cultured mannerisms and one-of-a-kind manner of speech, he's hardly the Everyman James Stewart specialized in portraying for Hitchcock (Stewart was originally to play the role but was dropped in favor of Grant.) It is an unusual character for Grant, but one thing is for certain- he is much more convincing as a ladies' man than Stewart ever was. And a funny thing about the character of Thornhill is we really don't get to know him well before the identity mix-up, other than he's a fast-talking ad exec who's twice divorced. Everything else that we learn about him, we learn from his reactions and responses to the situation he finds himself in. He's far from being perfect or brilliant, but he is resourceful and seems to surprise even himself in the degree to which he is attracted to and cares for Eve. Lehman and Hitchcock have thrown everything including the kitchen sink into the plot of 'North by Northwest' and somehow it all works magically. No doubt this was a real crowd-pleaser back in 1959 and it managed that without compromising Hitchcock's talent and vision one iota. A wonderful, wonderful film.",North by Northwest
223,manendra-lodhi,"""Not the best thriller but one of the best chases.""",8,23 October 2012,"No introductions. You get directly into the subject. There is a man Mr. Thornhill. He has been misjudged as a spy. The police and a group of people are trying hard to get to him. There are a lot of things in the film. There is no dullness. New and interesting things happen every now and then. While it misses the usual charm of the Hitchcock thriller, it has some of the best and authentic chase sequences I had ever seen. This is again one of the Hitchcock films, not to be missed.PROS:The screenplay is awesome and does not have the glitches with which old films suffer when seen by today's generation. The lead actress Eva has shown mind blowing performances. The same what had been seen by Tippie Hedron in The birds. The cinematography as usual is good in this film too. The opening title sequence was kind of grabbing attention. The good thing about the film is the authentic way that they show how a common man gets involved in all the hassle. While the outline of the film matches that of The Wrong man (1956), the tone of both the films is entirely different. The wrong man was more of a depressing type where you feel sad about him, whereas here you have a cheerful tone all the time. Neither the accused nor the people related to him look tensed. While this thing gives a feel that the characters lose some kind of authenticity, but then it completely changes the tone of the film also. And during the entire viewing of the film, the audience will not be sad and emotional. This thing generates a good feeling all the time. The role of the mother of Mr. Thornhill was short but too impressive. She did not bothered much about her son's safety and took everything so casually that it generates question, whether she was the real mother or not. The ending is particularly notable. Cons:The way I see it, Cary Grant was not impressive. It was the story and the supporting cast that has saved the film. His acting was mediocre. MESSAGE: ""Do not lose your calm.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",North by Northwest
224,ags123,A towering achievement.,10,23 April 2008,"This is Hitchcock's best film  quite an accomplishment, considering how many great films he created. And after half a century, ""North By Northwest"" holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains? And Eva Marie Saint's allure is multi-faceted. Movies just don't get better than this.",North by Northwest
225,rhinocerosfive-1,"Cary Grant and America, looking very well",8,14 September 2007,"There is none of the depth and gravity of ""Notorious"" here, but in this case the spy/whore love story is just a device to propel the real show: a Ray-Ban world of blithe sophistication. Cary Grant looks so good in that suit, and the architecture is so slick, and the images are so crystalline, that it's as if Ernest Lehman and Alfred Hitchcock had made a whole script and movie out of a Cadillac layout in Life magazine. Every detail looks designed by Arrow Shirt style engineers, from the monogrammed matchbooks to the immaculate train stations to the Brylcreem haircuts. Comfort food for American eyes - it was never like this, but this is how the Atomic Age dreamed next year would be: blue skies, sharp creases, big tailfins. In a couple of years the freaks were going to shoot Kennedy and start taking acid, but here we have a beatnik-free VistaVision tour of the American panorama as it never was, a moving picture album by Norman Rockwell, with good and evil simplified in living color.""North by Northwest"" is a spectacular stage for Mr Grant's urbane comic everyman. He loves this - equal parts ham and cheese, washed down with bitters and Vermouth. Grant plays a smart, rich guy like Peter Lorre plays a dirty child molester; that is, with alarming credibility. The wonderful James Mason is almost as tan and suave as his nemesis, but beside Grant's heroic, well-tailored figure, he photographs like a furtive rodent. Eva Marie Saint is at her least simian, and so strikingly eager to go to bed that we forgive her ridiculous convenience to the plot, and Grant for not noting her transparency. Martin Landau does more with his malevolent queer than the role deserves, and Leo G. Carrol is if anything more droll than Cary Grant, who defined the pose.Hitchcock is at his most superficially playful - the story is ludicrous, the emotion contrived. The whole thing shines coldly like burnished steel. It's so shallow, it shouldn't work, but it is a consistently delicious thrill ride: they mug the drunken car chase for all Grant's worth, then manage to get genuine danger out of it too; Grant's chummy relationship with his mother should be cloying but it's full of wit and charm; the idea of murder by biplane is absurd in intention, but somehow not in execution. The movie works because it plays to its limitations - the dumb laughs are breezy, the set pieces are massive and aerodynamic, the stock femme fatale is as hot as a Packard engine coasting at 100 mph. We're just along for the ride, anyway, and the scenery's exquisite.And the scene at the UN, with the photographer flashing a shot of an innocent man standing with a bloody knife over a murder victim - the stakes rise so fast, the set-up is so quiet, the choreography so clear. Brian DePalma wishes he had such chops.",North by Northwest
226,JaydoDre,Awesome.,9,12 December 2014,"There is one problem with this movie: the plot. It is too convenient and far-fetched. Characters are a little too stupid for the sake of the plot, mostly the main character, whenever it suits the movie. There is a scene where the main character gets attacked in a manner that would fit a James Bond film but this particular occasion does not call at all for such an attack, except for the show of course.Some movies like L.A. Confidential have too many minor layers that may end up losing the viewer, while this film goes the opposite direction, as far as to make its characters clarify out loud what had just occurred when it is not at all necessary.However, you will not care about the contrivance issue because the general structure of the film is so nice, it is so well shot and the performances are so great that the rest does not matter.The tension can be cut with a knife, and once it starts, it continues with barely a break until the end. Even though the movie can be a bit predictable, you cannot wait to see what happens next anyway.This is one of the more original and better looking movies. There are neat little tricks Hitchcock with the camera that keep surprising and this is all done in the 1950s may I remind. The mood of location is conveyed with excellency, like showing the vast middle-of-nowhere by shooting from a hight with a good long perspective.Perhaps a minor note, but this film also has quite a few good looking night scenes for the time. Many of the movies of this era use the day-for-night technique where the scene is shot in the daylight and then darkened in post-processing, which always looks really fake. North by Northwest does this much better, through a variety of techniques.Perhaps one visual issue is that it tends to use a lot of matte paintings to fill out the background and unfortunately some of them are quite noticeable.A brief word on the music: it goes a long way to help the movie feel tense. You hear those careful brass tunes pulsating and keeping the pressure at the surface.In addition this film has good actors all round, especially the villains, who aren't full of anger or fake laughter like in so many films, but polite, intelligent and sharp looking. Especially the young Martin Landau has a brilliant expression on his face, which can turn very devious while hardly changing at all.North by Northwest is, despite its plot issues, a very very good movie. This is the sort of film that makes a person want to find and watch every Hitchcock movie there is out there.",North by Northwest
227,Larry41OnEbay-2,Hitchcock and his favorite actor Grant have a field day in this cross country adventure of the wrong man!,10,31 December 2009,"NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a suspense film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason, and featuring Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau. The film is one of several Hitchcock movies with a film score by Bernard Herrmann and features a memorable opening title sequence by graphic designer Saul Bass. This film is generally cited as the first to feature extended use of kinetic typography in its opening credits. Kinetic typography—the technical name for ""moving text""—is an animation technique mixing motion and text.NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a tale of mistaken identity like previous Hitchcock films; THE 39 STEPS, SABOTEUR, VERTIGO and of course THE WRONG MAN. It also contains two MacGuffins. A MacGuffin is a plot element that catches the viewers' attention and drives central focus of the film in the first act and by the end is nearly forgotten. Like the money that Janet Leigh steals in the beginning of PSYCHO.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill = He was Hitchcock's favorite leading man and they made four films together. Hitchcock thought of Cary Grant as an actor's actor — considerate, pleasant to work with and able to make creative innovations that improved the appeal of any movie. Hitch once commented to an interviewer, ""...Look at me. Do you think I would have chosen to look like this. I would have preferred to have played a leading man in life. I would have been Cary Grant.""In 1986 I was lucky enough to meet Cary Grant in Cleveland Ohio at An Evening With Cary Grant which was a tour of personal appearances he made around the country... ""Why is someone as famous and wealthy as Cary Grant traveling to different places speaking to audiences?"" and he answered.... ""To build my self-assurance."""" I asked him two questions: first who would he want to play him in a biographical film on his life, and he said nobody would want to see a film about him. I then asked if he ever met Greta Garbo, and he was stunned, he said had never told that story to anyone... turns out he had met Garbo and it was one of the most embarrassing and charming moments of his life. He died while on tour 6 weeks later.Eva Marie Saint appears as Eve Kendall = Eva Marie Saint (was born July 4, 1924) She won an Academy Award for her feature film debut in ON THE WATERFRONT.James Mason plays sinister Phillip Vandamm (Mason was a British actor who is best known for David Lean's ODD MAN OUT (1947), the 1954 version of A STAR IS BORN & Stanley Kubrick's LOLITA. )Leo G. Carroll appeared in 5 Hitchcock films, more than any other actor. After this film where he plays ""the professor"" he went on to TV's THE MAN FROM UNCLE playing a very similar role.)Jessie Royce Landis plays Clara Thornhill. Landis, who played Thornhill's mother, was actually only eight years older than Grant. She also played his future mother-in-law in Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF just 4 years earlier.Martin Landau as Leonard (Martin Landau is now 78 years old, is perhaps best known for his roles in the television series Mission: Impossible for which he received a Golden Globe Award and two Emmy award nominations, it too could have been influenced by this film. In 1994 he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Bela Lugosi in ED WOOD.)Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In NORTH BY NORTHWEST it happens very early so he could get it out of the way and he could get back to telling the story. Script writer Ernest Lehman and Hitchcock worked very well together right from the start. When Lehman suggested they do the ""Ultimate"" Hitchcock film, Hitch said he always wanted to do a chase across Mount Rushmore. Some of the other ideas they came up with included a murder at a Detroit car plant, a man stranded in the middle of nowhere chased by a tornado, a murder at United Nations Headquarters and a final showdown in Alaska. Originally the story was to travel from New York to Alaska. That's where they came up with the original title of ""IN A NORTHWESTERLY DIRECTION."" Hitchcock wanted to call it ""THE MAN IN LINCOLN'S NOSE.""The idea about the decoy secret agent was actually based on a true story, Otis C. Guernsey a reporter who sold the idea to Hitchcock. During World War II a couple of British secretaries created a fictitious agent and then watched as the Germans wasted time trying to follow him around. After the serious psychoanalysis of VERTIGO Hitchcock wanted to do something fun, light-hearted, and free of the symbolism permeating his other movies. What he created is a masterpiece of deception, the central theme is that of theater and play-acting, wherein everyone is playing a part, no one is who they seem -- even the lead character, Thornhill is a successful advertising executive (a man who makes his living by distorting reality and deceiving the public.)FINALLY, there are two fun goofs to look for, one of Eva Marie Saint's lines in the dining car seduction scene was redubbed. So after Cary Grant says ""Is that a proposition?"" watch Eva Marie Saint's mouth carefully and you will see her say ""I never make love on an empty stomach"", but it was dubbed in post-production so you hear ""I never discuss love on an empty stomach."" It is said that the censors felt the original version was too risqué. Another goof is just before the shooting in the restaurant at Mt. Rushmore; watch the kid to the right of the post in the blue shirt",North by Northwest
228,ctowyi,Masterclass Cinema!,10,24 March 2016,"I have seen all those iconic scenes in snippets but have never seen the film in its entirety. By iconic I mean the scenes where a plane swoops down to attack Cary Grant like a hawk to a prey and the climatic foot chase at Mount Rushmore. Nowadays, the weak CGI might cause a frown on your face and they would probably feel too familiar, but you must remember they are first done here; this is the genesis. It's because of Alfred Hitchcock's North By Northwest that so many action scenes are possible. This is where it happened. I knew all that plus the taut suspense, the economically drawn characters, and the music score, but I never counted on such an awesome screenplay. The dialogue is simply amazing. Just the foreplay dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is the stuff of so much conversations. It is erotic and playful enough to make me grin like a monkey. It is filled with eroticism, yet subtle, never high-brow, with a cheeky know-it-all tone. The suspense coupled with the comedy and romance is almost a template for movies of this type nowadays, but no one can direct like the master. The film may be 1959 but it feels so on the beat even today. This is masterclass cinema.",North by Northwest

So to say long story short; I enjoyed in this movie and I'm 'only' 19 years old (this movie was made almost 50 years ago!!!). Why?

""North By Northwest"" was devised as entertainment, not art, which ""Vertigo"" is quite possibly is, so, trying to read meanings in this film is pointless. ""North By Northwest"" is the most enjoyable film the Master of Suspense ever created, finding the perfect hero in Cary Grant, who memorable encounters including the now iconic crop-duster scene and drunken drive along Long Island's coast.

Remind yourself that this is made in 1959, almost half a century ago. Then when you are watching Gary Grant running away from the plane, don't forget to close your mouth. You will probably say ""wow!"" There is so much to say about the movie. In the very beginning we see two old man--the 60-year-old director Hitchcock and the 58-year-old Gary Grant. But neither of them seemed dumb as Roger Moore in A View To A Kill. You will not sense the danger until Gary was forced to drink, and you will probably even develop a feeling of ""silly"" in the movie. But the plot was so brilliant that it will keep you concentrating to the end of the film.The encounter with Eve was not bad, but not better than the former Hitchcock movies either. Fortunately the script didn't corrupted on the beauty. The part that the plane chases Gary was unforgettable. So does the Rushmore climb.There aren't many special effects to support the fun of optical.

232,patryk-czekaj,A one of a kind Hitchcockian experience,10,29 April 2012,"Having seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's works I must admit that North by Northwest has quickly become my favorite, even though it may not possess the typical Hitchcockian motives. What's more, It could as well be placed in the same box as the James Bond franchise, because it may in some aspects remind of the well-known spy movies (Cary Grant could have been a perfect 007, with his elegance, handsome face and fantastic overall presence). However, I must say that it combines a better-developed structure, more wit in its dialogues and greater suspenseful sequences than any Bond movie does. Also, personally I thought that Eva Marie Saint was much more appealing than all of the Bond girls combined.The main plot introduces the whole movie as a serious and thrilling mystery of a man, who is mistaken for an agent and embarks on a journey to clear his name. Still, apart from that, there are various comedic aspects of the film, along with my favorite scene in the first few minutes, when Roger Thornhill (played brilliantly by Cary Grant) is being held captive, forced to get drunk and then ride a car. As for the romantic section, there is the ongoing chemistry between the devious Eve Kendell and Thornhill.All those aspects make up for an amazing and most enjoyable plot. The ideal mix of all the conjoint, yet rather opposing, factors marks the true genius of the director himself. Even though all of Hitchcock's pictures are undisputed masterpieces, North by Northwest captivated me the most. I haven't really seen a movie that offers so much - perfect plot-subplots combination, intelligent script, memorable scenes, many distinct sceneries, tremendous acting (great supporting roles by James Mason, Leo G. Carroll and Martin Landau) and, most importantly, the building of suspense until the very last minute. It is also the best Hitchcock- Grant collaboration you will find. Even though the picture didn't win an Oscar in any of the three categories that it was nominated in, it surely could have won an Award for the best picture of the year. Or the decade. Or the century. Because every time you watch this fantastic movie you will be able to find a new part that will catch your attention. That is the true genius of Hitchcock. He made a movie that brings out everything that is the greatest about the motion picture industry, that is the ability to develop a masterwork that can be interesting to every single person in the world.",North by Northwest

234,Scaramouche2004,Suspense in its purest form,9,6 June 2005,"This film is absolutely superb. A classic suspense thriller, with traces of romance and comedy, North by Northwest is a stylish and well executed film which doesn't seem at all dated or irrelevant despite its 46 year age tag.Alfred Hitchcock was a past master at bringing us movies in which an innocent victim is caught in a web of intrigue and danger. The Thirty Nine Steps to name just one is a classic example of where the central 'Average Joe' character becomes a 'Rabbit in Headlights' as he tries to our run and out smart his would-be assassins. It is a formula so successful, that it is still being used today, more recently in films like 'Paycheck.'North by Northwest, although similar takes Hitchcock's formula to a higher level, as innocent advertising executive Roger Thornhill runs into kidnappers, gunmen, knife wielding assassins, kamikaze crop dusting planes and a beautiful femme fatale, as he tries to piece together why his life has taken such a dramatic and dangerous turn and who is trying to kill him and why?Cary Grant, is outstanding in the role of Thornhill and given to a lesser actor the film, I'm sure would not have achieved the iconic status or success that it did. It was obvious from the beginning that this was going to be Grant's shining hour.Martin Landau, Grant's co- star once remarked as how it became completely un-necessary to introduce Grant's character in a any great detail, for as soon as the opening credits ended, and we saw Grant and his secretary depart from a Madison Avenue elevator, we knew exactly who he was. He was dapper and debonair Cary Grant and that was all there was to it.I also like this film as it is probably the only film in his illustrious career, that we get to see ALL of Cary Grant's facets in the same film. We have wonderful comedic moments, like the drink driving scene and his subsequent arrest. Here we see Grant akin to the Grant of The Awful Truth, Bringing Up Baby or His Girl Friday. Then we have the action and suspense scenes, which bring to mind his performances in Suspicion, Notorious, To Catch a Thief and even Gunga Din, and of course we have the romantic leading man straight from An Affair to Remember. It is rare for Grant to show us so much in one film. We all know he was capable of making us laugh or cry in any given performance, but not all at once. It is this fact above all others that makes this film sensational.Add strong support from the scene-stealing Bond-style villain James Mason, creepy evil henchman Martin Landau, a beautiful but deceitful Eva-Marie Saint and ruthless federal agent Leo G. Carroll, have them chase each other across middle America and Mount Rushmore add an unexpected twist or two and just a pinch of romance, you have one of the most exiting thrillers ever filmed.This film is a tour de force, for Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock. It was the forth collaboration between them and undoubtedly their best.Unmissable.",North by Northwest
235,Elizabeth-328,Suspenseful masterpiece!,10,25 February 2000,"I think ""North by Northwest"" is great!  Cary Grant is his charming self as Roger Thornhill, and Eva Marie Saint is delightful as Eve Kendell.  I also think James Mason gives an excellent performance as bad guy Vandamm. 
My favorite part is the auction scene.  Roger knows that Vandamm's men are surrounding the place, and that he would never get out alive.  So the only way to escape is to create a disturbance, and be escorted out by the police. This is exactly what he does, and it's hilarious!Although everyone has seen the famous and climactic chase scene across Mount Rushmore, there is a great movie before and after that.  I think that this movie contains one of Hitchcock's best ""Mac Guffins"", which is an extremely slight reference to what makes the enemy so bad.  As the Professor says, Vandamm exploits ""government secrets"".  Hitchcock always said that this wasn't important to the plot, because we only need to know that Vandamm is after Roger.

237,ryangilmer007,Don't Miss the Bus,8,18 May 2000,"North By Northwest is classic Hitchcock and is a moive not to be missed. 
There are only a few minor mishaps--> I rank the movie a little lower than perhaps it deserves because the video version has some faded colors.  This may be fixed if re-released in a remastered version.  However, it may also be due to film deterioration (as color movies shot on one real of Kodak) rather than 3, fade over time).The other minor goofs are caused my the time period of the 1959 and the recent jumps is special effects technology.  The actors over blue screens are very obvious in parts.This mistakes cause this not to be a perfect movie, but it is still a classic.  There is great acting and a great story.  You should be engaged and intrigued, and always surprised and what will occur next.  It is also very non-predictable as nobody is safe at anytime, so basically anything can occur in the story.At the same time, the story flows easilly and logically from place to place. (unlike Hitchcock's earlier ""Secret Agent"" were locations are not fully explained, North by Northwest fully utilizes the locations and uses them to add to the story).Other little idosyncronsies further add to the story as art, airlines, the UN, Mt. Rushmore (plus the fact that 100 pines were planted on an MGM sound-lot to make it look like the surrounding ""Rushmore"" woods), and a reference to Shakespeare (the title) all add to the story.Originally known as ""The Man in Lincoln's Nose"", North By Northwest will not disappoint.However, don't miss the bus as Hitchcock makes his appearance before the appearance of Grant, whom the role was written for and whom shows valid reasons for why the James Bond producers wanting him for the James Bond role. (he did not get that role because he would only do 2 or 3 bond movies)Rating: 8Viewed: on tape",North by Northwest
238,dkncd,"""War is hell ... even when it's a cold one.""",10,18 September 2007,"""North by Northwest"" is Alfred Hitchcock's film about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive who is mistaken for a secret agent and becomes entangled in a web of intrigue. The film shows the world of espionage as dangerous yet glamorous, making this in some ways a precursor to the James Bond films which would come soon after. However, ""North by Northwest"" has a stronger degree of intrigue and characterization than is seen in any Bond film.Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill with all the necessary charm and Eva Marie Saint is likewise perfect as the enigmatic Eve Kendall and the chemistry between the two is extraordinary. The supporting performances are also strong: James Mason as the forceful Vandamm, Martin Landau and Vandamm's other lackeys and even Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's generally unimpressed mother. Leo G. Carroll also deserves note as his look and demeanor fit very well with his role as ""The Professor"".The story is effective at being enticing early with its tantalizing premise and developing with enough intrigue and characterization to keep it engaging. The action scenes, in particular two famous ones, are well-staged, tense and unorthodox to a degree that keeps them interesting. There is also a lot of well-placed humor injected into the film in between the moments of intrigue and action. ""North by Northwest"" should satisfy those looking for those seeking a spy film with a strong amount intrigue and characterization and those seeking a spy film well-paced with notable action scenes.",North by Northwest
239,LuboLarsson,Classic Hitchcock,9,4 January 2004,"This is a very entertaining Alfred Hitchcock film, it has all the twists and turns you would expect from the director and is great escapist fun. Cary Grant is pretty good in the lead role but personally I would have preferred James Stewart as I think his films with Hitchcock are superb especially Rear Window and my favourite Vertigo. Still thats a minor quibble as this is film is excellent in every other way, James Mason and Martin Landau are especially good as the bad guys and the music is excellent. This film also contains one of the finest scenes in cinematic history as Grant waits by a roadside apparently waiting to meet someone. Also the Bond films seem to have been heavily influenced by this film especially From Russia With Love. I highly recommend you get your hands on the DVD as I picked it up quite cheap and the picture quality and extras are superb ***9/10***",North by Northwest
240,quinimdb,North by Northwest,9,3 April 2016,"""North by Northwest"" is one of Hitchcock's best films, and I'd even say it is his most purely entertaining.The film starts off with a tracking shot of Roger Thornhill walking and talking quickly in a large crowd of people who all seem to be in a hurry. Right now he is simply a face in a crowd, but thanks to an identity mix up, he is soon a national criminal and has to constantly avoid not only the police, but the criminals that believe he is a government agent. And... that's pretty much the movie. But thanks to Hitchcock's direction and a constantly entertaining, tense, and surprisingly funny screenplay, this is now one of the all time classics.And it completely deserves that status. The best way to describe why it does, is to use an example from the film. So, I will use the most famous scene. First, some context. So Roger Thornhill is instructed by Eve Kendall to go to this one area in the middle of nowhere in order for him to meet this secret agent so he can figure out what is going on. There are 2 things Robert doesn't know however: this secret agent doesn't exist, and Eve is setting him up. The audience knows both these things at this point. So Roger arrives at this location and it is completely empty. We see a lone crop duster in the background, but that's about it. Suddenly, we see a car coming, and while Roger thinks, ""Will this be the man that will help me?"", the audience is thinking ""Is this man going to try and kill Roger?"". A few more cars pass, each time the audience (and Roger) expects it to be the man. Finally, we see a car coming slowly from a route we haven't seen before. He comes closer and closer, until finally, he stops. Then, the door opens. A man gets out. The audience is held in this suspense for a little while. Then, finally, Roger approaches him. He begins to talk to him, and it becomes apparent that this is not the man. They both start talking and begin to notice the crop duster. The man then points out that the plane is not crop dusting where there are crops. Suddenly, the audience realizes, what is about to happen. The man gets in the bus, the bus drives away, and the plane begins to fly directly at Roger.This scene continues, and it's the best and most suspenseful scene in the whole film, but many other scenes in the film aren't far behind. And that is saying something. The situation that Roger gets into, where no one is on his side and he constantly has to think on his feet, means that there is constant tension and threat in this film. And the fact that each scene in this film (that one in particular) is shot, edited, and blocked to perfection, means that this film contains some of the most suspenseful moments in any Hitchcock film, scratch that, any film in general.",North by Northwest

242,C22Man,A Personal Favourite,7,14 July 2016,"North by Northwest is a personal favourite of mine. It is Hitchcock's most light and purely entertaining film, a smart change of pace after the darkly psychological 'Vertigo'. It takes his signature wrong man storyline and simply sees how much fun it can have with the idea. It makes the characters as charming as possible, the action grander than ever before, the locations exotic and the situations as exciting as you could want them to be. It's a film that succeeds in its aim magnificently, give the audience a thrilling adventure. It revolves around suave advertising executive Roger Thornhill who is kidnapped after being mistaken for 'George Kaplan' and interrogated before almost being killed by the shady Vandamm. Nobody believes Thornhill's story so he sets out to find Kaplan himself. However he has to go on the run when he's framed for murder, which draws him into a world of deceit, spies and simply trying to stay alive. This story is not only brilliantly entertaining, but it twists and turns all the time. You don't know who Thornhill can trust or what's waiting around the corner for him, making him a vulnerable hero. A good example being when he meets Eve Kendell, we don't know whether she's a kind stranger, a spy herself or working with the enemy. It is great at keeping you guessing like that. What always impresses me about the film is how it blends genres so easily. It is a thrilling adventure at heart of course. Yet there are smatterings of mystery, action, romance and comedy throughout. It leaps between all of these without any feeling out of place and without losing sight of the plot. Most of the characters actions drive the narrative forward in that sense, what we initially think is only loosely connected may end having a larger bearing. Almost everything that happens on screen has leads to something else. In fact the humour in the film is something that really stands out. The situations are dangerous yet they can also be wonderfully absurd and the film finds genuine laughs with the idea of a normal person being forced to risk his life in such a way.The performances are great all round. Cary Grant is delivers one of the most stylish performances of all time as Thornhill. He makes the character so debonair and charming, seemingly unfazed by the deadly situations he finds himself in, with a sharp wit and wisecracks at the ready. He's clearly enjoying himself and is a magnetic screen presence. Eva Marie Saint is effortlessly appealing as Kendell, probably the most humane of Hitchcock's icy blondes. James Mason is just wonderful as Vandamm. He's the perfect villain. Subtle, mysterious, cunning, strangely charismatic, all with a smooth voice and expressive features. The notable supporting performances come from Martin Landau as creepy heavy Leonard and Jessie Royce Landis as Thornhill's sardonic mother. The film is filled with memorable sequences and imagery. The romantic playfulness of the scenes aboard the train. The brilliant scene where Thornhill deliberately sabotages an auction. The truly spectacular climax that takes place atop Mount Rushmore. One of my favourite sequences in all of film is when Thornhill waits for 'Kaplan' on a stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. The way Hitchcock manages to build a sense of tension and isolation is simply masterfully. It also leads to the noteworthy crop duster sequence. This is how you do action. It might not seem like much, but we really do feel as if Thornhill's life is at risk and that gives it so much more impact than any fancy effects or choreography could.Hitchcock's direction is as good as ever. The camera-work is very fluid here, it moves gently around the screen at times, almost as if it's surveying the area. His staging of the action sequences and moments of important dialogue help immensely in giving the scenes the weight they need. This is also a handsome looking film. Everything from The hotel interiors to the train carriages to the UN building looks fantastic and is lit well. Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and it is a brilliant one, full of witty dialogue that roles off the tongue exquisitely. Apparently he was attempting to write the ultimate Hitchcock thriller, I think it's fair to say that he succeeded in doing so. Bernard Herrmann's dynamic score, and its wonderful main theme, is just the icing on the cake. In many ways North by Northwest is like the prototype Bond film, except it's unrestrained by any formula and contains Hitchcock's trademark thrills. We have a dashing main character, the beautiful female for him to latch on to, a diabolical but charming villain, a surging plot and visually interesting locations. Of course the difference maker is Hitchcock himself. He has a plot and script that allow him to do what he does best to the most unrestricted level he's ever done. The thrills, the suspense, the action, the excitement, not to mention the subtle comedy and romance. It's all here and it's even grander than before. This is Hitchcock's exercise in escapist fun. It gives us pure thrills without any pretensions and I wouldn't change a thing about it.",North by Northwest

245,Kubris,Classic thriller! With a plane!,9,29 August 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 39 ""They said I lived a dull life."" says Roger Thornhill, hero of the Hitchcock classic, 'North by Northwest'. And for 2 hours and 11 minutes it's most certainly not true. 'Northwest' is an essential thriller, and one of Hitchcock's best.Cary Grant stars as a Mad Man (advertising agent) who is mistaken for a spy. Things don't go his way, and he becomes wanted for murder too. He goes on the run to find out what's going on, aided by Eve Kendall. Unlike many other thrillers, even Hitchcock's own quintessential 'Psycho', events are set into motion right away. And then you can't let go. There are many twists, some small, some large, but right until the abrupt end, a viewer cannot call this film boring.It starts with the leading man. Cary Grant looks the part of a New York businessman. His surprised expression isn't the most convincing, but his charm is. His chemistry with Eve Marie Saint chemistry makes the dialogue-laden scenes, namely the remarkable train scene, interesting and charming to watch. They're a great couple.Speaking of scenes, Northwest has several notable and famous ones. The aforementioned train sequence, the art auction, and the lunchroom are cute, funny and shocking, but two steal the show. The very famous plains with the cropduster, and the chase on Mount Rushmore. The duster is just so out there it's fantastic, and the most iconic part of the film, and the chase is grand and nailbiting.Worth noting, the title sequence is really cool, and the musical score is fitting. On another note, two things bugged me: *mild spoilers* why Thornhill would pull the knife out and turn to a camera is beyond me and unbelievable- I understand it moved the plot, but Hitchcock's a smart guy, he could've thought of a more reasonable scenario. Also the ending, while involving everything necessary, was very abrupt. We went from danger to 'The End' in less than 10 seconds. But these are acceptable issues in an otherwise outstanding film that as stood the test of time and aged very well. 8.7/10",North by Northwest
246,joelgodinho,"""Games, must we?""",10,29 November 2020,"North By Northwest is a 1959 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint and James Mason.This was my second viewing of this masterpiece and only now have I come to really apreciate how great it is since on my first watch I didn't enjoy it all that much, I was expecting a mesmerizing film visually and story wise that would make my jaw drop like Psycho or Vertigo and I don't think NbN is quite like that, but that doesn't really mean that it's necessarily worse then the previously mentioned.I feel like this is more of a laid back film to entertain and have a lot of fun with.It's probably the funniest Hitchcock film I have seen particularly the auction house sequence is hilarious, the cast is nothing short of perfect, starting with the main actor, they originally had Jimmy Stewart in mind to play Roger Thornhill and, while Stewart is easily my favourite actor of all time, I'm happy they chose Cary Grant for the role because I could not see anyone else playing Thornhill, Grant just has a certain charm and coolness to him that make him the perfect choice for Thornhill's character and needless to say he plays him incredibly, I would even argue that Grant's Thornhill is the ultimate action movie hero, his dialogue is super funny and memourable and he makes even simple sentences sound iconic like ""Hey, what's that suposed to be?"".Eva Marie Saint is also really great as Eve Kendall and James Mason is just incredible as the main villain, he is both menacing and very charming with his absolutely magnificent voice, I would willingly sit trough a 6 hour audiobook about the history of door knobs if it was narrated by him and Martin Landau is just as great as the more sinister and menacing right hand of the villain.North By Northwest has some of the greatest and most iconic set pieces in cinema, the most memourable among them (and arguably the most iconic action sequence ever) is the Crop Duster attack, there are few scenes in the history of cinema as unforgettable or as thrilling as this one in fact it might be the most memourable scene from an Hitchcock film (aside from the shower scene from Psycho which may be the most memourable moment in cinema history) however it would be a mistake to ignore the other fantastic moments of this film, I have already mentioned the auction house part but there is also that last chase sequence on mount Rushmore which is just incredible and the perfect way to finnish the film.Bernard Herrmann's score perfectly complements the film and is one of his best, maybe even my third favourite from him, behind only his works on Psycho and Vertigo.10/10.",North by Northwest
247,dtb,From The Master of Suspense Came the Daddy of the Modern Adventure Thrillers,10,7 February 2004,"Many feel this is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest American movie, and I agree! NORTH BY NORTHWEST is the Hitchcock film to end all Hitch films, with all his pet themes covered with maximum wit, panache, and suspense, as well as a romance between Cary Grant and a soignée Eva Marie Saint that's as tender as it is sexy. Grant has never been more engaging and dashing (literally and figuratively :-), though the smoothly villainous James Mason nearly out-suaves him. My husband and I have joked that if Mason had played Thornhill, the film would have been over in mere moments. With all due respect to Grant, if the imperious, unshakably confident Mason asked the Glen Cove police, ""Do you honestly believe that this happened the way you think it did?"" they would immediately reply, ""No, sir, you must be right, you're free to go, sorry we bothered you."" :-) Also boasts a great early performance by a reptilian young Martin Landau as Mason's possessive henchman, as well as one of Oscar nominee Ernest Lehman's best screenplays (in fact, he borrowed liberally from it for his script for the film version of THE PRIZE starring Paul Newman) and one of Bernard Herrmann's finest scores.

248,steven_torrey,Is that plane really after me? Kafkesque,10,22 July 2018,"Like all absurdist theatre, this is suffused with comedy. It is absurd like Gregor Samsa turned into a cockroach. Absurd like the prophet Job tested by God at the behest of Satan to test Job's faith. And we all know by now, that the Book of Job should be read with a laugh track: Eliphar, Bildad, Zophar, and Elihu provide irrelevant (and hence unintended absurdist comedy) commentary to Job's affliction. Absurdist like the twists and turns of Oliver Twist... You get the idea.Cary Grant is not playing Cary Grant, he really plays a man bewildered by the chain of events that have beset him. Watch his facial expression as he is drunk driving the car and drunk in the police station; that is acting. He plays the role of absurdity straight, unaware till the end of the parameters of the absurd. And there is nothing more absurd than the spy agencies with the numerous twists and turns in the defense of a nation's integrity. And in the end, the assertion of love (Grant & Eva Marie Saint) is an assertion of sanity and denial of absurdity.But there is unmistakable and intentional comedy in the auction scene where Grant seemingly channels Leo G. Carroll's TV Cosmo Topper's vocal cadences in making irrelevant bids which end up as absurdist non-sequiturs just as Cosmo Topper did. And Grant played the role of ghost George Kirby to Roland Young's Cosmos Topper; while Leo G. Carroll was the TV Cosmo Topper; now that is Hitchcock comedy at its finest!How long should the drama be? As long as it takes to explain something. And sure enough, each part of the unfolding drama contains the needed time for the suspense: the endless road in the corn field adds for the cinematic suspense as does the lone individual waiting for a bus. (""Waiting for Godot"") The scene in the Restaurant where Eva Marie Saint shoots Grant with a fake gun. (""The Sting"")The scene with Eva Marie Saint in the Hotel Room. The scene at the house just before he warns Eva Marie Saint, that she has been found out. And so on. Each of these scenes have suspense from beginning to end. Even as they harken to other dramatic performances encapsulating absurdity, even if planned absurdity as in ""The Sting.""
This may be Grant's best and finest performance; this may be Hitchcock's best and finest film production, to rival ""The 39 Steps"". the cast of Grant, Mason, and Eva Marie Saint give the proper balance; Leo G. Carroll is a plus.",North by Northwest
249,robb_772,It's impossible to praise this film too much,10,28 July 2006,"Arguably director Alfred Hitchcock's best-loved film, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is an insanely skillful blend of action, romance, comedy, and intrigue that never feels contrived or strained. The film was almost instantly embraced by critics and audiences as a film masterpiece, and it has since only grown in reputation as one of the all-time great films of any era. Amazingly, this is certainly one case where such high ended praise is completely deserved, and, in fact, this is one of those rare films that have been heralded as a ""classic"" for decades that truly meets such impossibly high expectations. As a matter of fact, it very well may be impossible to say too many good things about this picture.Alfred Hitchcock is always a director that typically placed technical film craft over the importance of such necessary dramatic devices such as plausible plot twists and significant character development. As a matter of fact, the 1946 film Notorious (which gets my vote as the master's best film) is probably the only truly character-driven film of his career. However, the artificiality of the plot and strictly two-dimensional nature of the character is absolutely not a problem in this film, and may even be one of its strongest assets. This is because NORTH BY NORTHWEST, as with Hitchcock's 1955 picture TO CATCH A THIEF, is a total farce from beginning to end, and typically strong storytelling elements such as a clear narrative and believable characters would have only bloated the picture.Further cementing the film's status as an unquestioned masterwork is the jaw-dropping number of eye-catching set pieces that retain in the memory even years after the picture has ended, yet somehow manage to gel into a coherent whole. Hitchcock was in the absolute peak of his technical prowess here, and each and every scene plays out with the seemingly impossible professionalism that only a truly skilled and inventive filmmaker can achieve. Sure, the now-landmark crop duster scene and the Mt. Rushmore finale are now as permanently etched in the public's collective conscious as the Nation Anthem, but virtually any other scene in the film (no matter how minor it's significance) is nearly as stunning. And Hitchcock also pulls memorable performances from Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Jessie Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, Phillip Ober, and Martin Landau  all whom are perfectly cast and play their intentionally thin roles with an alarming exactness.Yet even more than Hitchcock's film-making mastery, the real reason the film is an absolute gem from beginning to end is none other than Cary Grant. At age 55 and still unnervingly handsome, Grant is perhaps Hitchcock's perfect on-screen hero as he jump-starts even the most under-developed roles with magnetic charisma, dapper humor, and an disarming sex appeal that remains absolutely effortless even in his third decade as actor. The film basically calls upon Grant to venture into practically ever screen personae that he had personified up to that time, and the dashing actor impressively never misses a beat. Although NORTH BY NORTHWEST is a film that has completely earned the title of masterpiece for many reasons, watching one of the silver screen's ultimate stars work his uncompromised magic is reason enough to hold it in high esteem.",North by Northwest

The plot is pretty solid too.Roger Thornhill gets roped into all sorts of unexpected activities, firstly reacting with indignation but then gradually adapting as he comes to accept the circumstances and understand his role.Hitchcock uncovers the plot twists on a gradual basis instead of confusing us by going in too heavy or too deep, inviting us into the film by gently pushing forward the intrigue and not bamboozling us by making us think too hard. I didn't second guess the plot at all though, which is a sign of a really great film, afterwards feeling as though I'd witnessed something worthwhile, feeling happier with my day and overall disposition in life.An unexpected film with strangely subtle James Bond, albeit action-free undertones and a few minor implausibilities, but which grabbed me within the first few minutes and kept me there throughout.",North by Northwest

255,Don-102,Hitchcock's Most Entertaining Thriller...,10,23 March 1999,"The 1950's was an amazing decade for Alfred Hitchcock.  Year after year, he churned out some sort of a classic: STRANGERS ON A TRAIN, REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, etc..  He capped it with the most exciting film he ever directed. NORTH BY NORTHWEST is sheer escapist entertainment, a non-stop ride across the country, with Hitch dealing out his usual cards.  Innocent man (Cary Grant) in a crazy situation which he is wrongfully drawn into, and the beautiful leading lady (Eva Marie Saint), who always seem to be blonde.  I also have to say that musical composer Bernard Herrmann has produced one of his top 3 scores (the other 2 being TAXI DRIVER and PSYCHO).  Right from the opening title sequence, we are souring into this story of international intrigue, decoys, and constant pursuit.The film barely lets up as Grant, in his own dashing manner, plays it cool as an advertising exec who becomes surrounded by the bad guys before we even get settled into our seats.  This is the mother of all modern action/chase films, with pitstops at the UN building, Grand Central Station, Chicago, a vast cornfield, and finally, Mount Rushmore.  Grant's scene on the field has become one of the most famous sequences of all-time.  That dust-cropper definitely had a mind of its own.  The great thing about the scene is that about 90% of it was shot on location.  Again, listen to that music.  It explodes with the suspense of the scene.You never know what side of the fence Hitch's characters are on at times. Is there a real ""Kaplan""?  Why did the bad guys pick Grant as their target? Eva Marie Saint is not so saintly as the alluring blonde who has some kind of angle on the events herself.  You're never really sure what she is up to. This is the greatness and originality of the ""worlds"" Hitchcock and his writers create.  Things are never as they appear.  It is up to the viewer to pay attention or let him play you like a fiddle.  Either way, you come out satisfied.This is not his 'best' film.  It is his most thrilling flick, and it also has the refreshing sense of humor that enlighten Hitch's best pictures. In terms of action and adventure, this has no equal within his library of films with perhaps the exception of 1940's FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT.  Great dialogue, slick and stylish directing, and a sense of pure fun makes this one better.RATING - 10 of 10",North by Northwest
256,marissas75,Across America and into Movieland,10,8 March 2007,"""North by Northwest"" is surely one of the most purely entertaining, gripping, and flat-out fun movies of all time. From the moment some nefarious men mistake Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) for a CIA agent named George Kaplan, the movie is a chain of dangerous situations each more suspenseful than the lastwhich keep you wondering ""How in the world is he going to get out of THIS one?""But at the same time, despite the fact that the movie is about a man running from people who want to kill him (the French title translates to ""Death At His Heels"") it's all done with a light touch. After all, there's a strong escapist element to Thornhill's story: visiting the UN, Chicago and Mount Rushmore under bright sunny skies, running from an office job to help protect valuable government secrets, getting propositioned by a seductive blonde (Eva Marie Saint), and always wearing a spotless gray suit. (OK, it does get mussed-up in the justly famous crop-duster sequence.)The little details of ""North by Northwest"" are, for the most part, spot-on. Casting James Mason as the main villain is extremely cleverhe's one of the only actors who can match Grant for smooth elegance and charisma, and it's fun to see them go head-to-head. And even though Grant's role mainly consists of narrowly escaping from danger during a cross-country journey, the film also gives him a little emotional journey too. In the beginning, you like Roger Thornhill because he makes wisecracks and looks like Cary Grant. In the end, you like him because he's discovered that he is actually a good, honorable man.Eva Marie Saint is not quite a natural for her role as a mysterious, glamorous woman (she'll always be the shy girl from ""On the Waterfront"" to me)she seems to imitate the character rather than embody her. But this doesn't ruin the movie; indeed, ""North by Northwest"" is all about artifice and imitation. It acknowledges that it exists in Movieland, not real life, then devotes itself to providing more than two hours of pure cinematic delight.",North by Northwest

Maybe it's cause the final half hour drags way more than it should, but I just can't see myself ever really revisiting this in the future.

259,moviemattb,A Suspenseful Spy Thriller by The Master of Suspense,10,4 May 2014,"""North by Northwest"" is definitely one of my favorite movies by Alfred Hitchcock. He is a pretty darn good filmmaker who knows how to tell a story and where to point the camera at. The movie is about Roger Thornhill, an advertising executive, who has been kidnapped by Phillip Vandamm and his men by a mistaken identity George Kaplan who doesn't exist. So Thornhill has been wrongfully accused as a fugitive and pursed himself across the country. I thought the cast in this movie did wonderful. Cary Grant does a remarkable job for his performance for being funny, confused, and being likable. Eva Marie Saint was lovely in this movie and she was fascinating. James Mason and a young Martin Landau were terrific for playing their roles as the villains. Bernard Herrmann's score was outstanding for creating music for suspense, romance, and excitement. The cinematography in this movie is beautifully shot, and the cornfield scene where Thornhill is being attacked by an airplane is well done. Give thanks to the Master of Suspense for making such an exciting movie. I give ""North by Northwest"" a 10 out of 10.",North by Northwest
260,IamROCKAS,One curve ball after another just doesn't give this movie a chance to be boring.,10,15 January 2021,"This movie is great because for the majority of its run we know just as much as our protagonist, Roger Thornhill, played by the late Cary Grant. Finding out bits of information while great action instances, saboteur plots, and plot twists lead us by the hand makes the movie feel really fresh as it flows like a smooth river, taking us unexpected turns along the way. The juxtaposition between Mr. Thornhill not understanding what the hell is going on and dealing with the situation like an experienced spy is a joy to watch and experience as Cary Glant's performance is exceptionally good. I praised movie from this era for having wonderful dialogues before and the witty remarks Mr. Thornhill throws out every other scene is no exception - he uses words to great effect and when you add Eve Kendall, played by Eva Marie Saint (who is still kicking and is three years away from turning 100 years old), to the mix, you get the James-Bond like charisma before James Bond and Bond girls even appeared on the big screen. Overall, Albert Hitchcock did a marvelous job creating a confusing situation that only got better by the minute, and let's take a moment to appreciate his little cameo in the movie too.It's no surprise that I really enjoyed the movie. It makes me want to watch the original James Bond movies from the '60s and see how they did spy thrillers back then. If they're at least half-as-smartly written and witty as North by Northwest, I'm going to have a good time.",North by Northwest
261,Koundinya,A timeless thriller which mixes romance with suspense in equal proportions.,10,23 December 2012,"What makes this movie stand apart from the modern day thrillers- the story that leaves us bemused for more than an hour from the commencing of the movie, Hitchcock's direction and the wonderful camera work that by all means bolsters his way of presenting a story and not just telling a story, or is it a great actor who never caught up with age and exemplified a gentleman as a man in a tuxedo? I'd say, all of it.Just as you think the movie is headed in no particular direction, Hitchcock steers the swerving vehicle first towards North by train and then Northwest by flight.Anyone who has watched the film cannot simply remain silent about the fact that they witnessed the best typography ever, a work from the master of it, Saul Bass. And like every other Hitchcock's films, Bernard's soundtracks adds to the suspense in the story.",North by Northwest
262,tmpsvita,Simply a cult,8,6 July 2018,"Hitchcock is undoubtedly one of the greatest, more visionary and brilliant directors of all time, he had made films that are still admired and studied in schools for their incredible technical quality to say the least in the vanguard.
Among the various cult that bear his signature one of the best known is this ""North by Norhwest"" a film that deserves to be remembered as such but which suffers, perhaps more than its other major films, of an aging fairly felt as far as it affects the rhythm and fluidity of it, unfortunately this affects the general vision, especially in our days when we are accustomed to extremely fast thrillers to appear almost exasperated.
It is incredible, however, that despite this great obstacle due to its age (about sixty years) the film manages to transmit, in the first half in a more fluctuating manner and in the second in a more diluted and concrete way, a strong suspense, element that distinguishes virtually all movies of the master, which allows the whole story to be followed with great interest, fundamental aspect in a film of this kind.
To make this possible is the excellent screenplay that, among ingenious narrative cues, sought-after twists and iconic and intelligent dialogues, makes everything an amiably elegant and fascinating package in full spy style that is still envious today. Also giving away the excellent characters interpreted in a particularly natural and credible way by names such as Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint, which make them irresistible and absolutely pleasant to see.
Hitchcock, in addition to its tasty initial cameo, gives the film an admirable direction: each shot is chosen with great attention to detail, especially those concerning the environment, each functional and peculiar, and shows a genius in always choosing the 'angle that can enhance the scene at best.
Unfortunately, as I said the film is not light, although this is really subjective as an aspect, and because of this it fails to reach its full potential and losing a bit of its charisma and character that would make it a film easier to remember and, in a sense, to be seen; but one thing is certain any cinephile should see it just to learn something more about the cinema.",North by Northwest

264,joshuafagan-64214,Best Hitchcock Movie,10,26 September 2015,"If anyone has doubts about the power of mistaken identity and its place in fiction, look no further than this film. The many hokey takes on it through the years have diminished its very real power as a storytelling device. As a comedy trick, it is cheap and dull. But as a dramatic trick... there is real force behind it. Everyone dreads being alone in the time of a crisis and not having anyone believe them and feeling like they are sinking further and further into a pit that's growing ever deeper and deeper. A good filmmaker can use the idea of mistaken identity in a tense situation to tackle these fears. And Hitchcock most certainly is a few steps above a good filmmaker.In fact, he is at his best here. Vertigo may be his best shot film from an artistic point of view. Rear Window (which I would have done a review of for this series of critical takes if I had seen it in time and is quite excellent) is his most interestingly shot movie perspective-wise. But this is Hitchcock showing his truest colors. All the tropes of his directorial style are on full display and are in fine shape. I often joke to myself (I'm alone a lot) about Hitchcock's love of his use of his specific style dashboard cam no matter the situation, but it can be an effective cinematic tool to increase tension, make the area feel more claustrophobic, and increase focus on the characters.To give a one-sentence synopsis: An advertising executive is mistaken for a secret agent from the authorities and must go on the run. What follows is a wild yet deft 136 minutes of what I believe to be Hitchcock's most obviously entertaining film. Pulses pound as the characters move like chess pieces around a well-written, twisting and turning storyline that causes many iconic scenes, the most famous of which being when Thornhill (The protagonist) runs from a crop duster craft. It is everything an action scenes should be, and the isolation kicks every element up a few notches. It is the favorite scene of many, including me.Every element, from the action to the mystery, is well-executed. The dialogue is interesting, as it is in many Hitchcock movies. In fact, one of Hitchcock's most underrated talents is writing-dialogue. He may not be a Sorkin or a Woody Allen, but he knows that dialogue is the key to making interesting characters that are more than just pieces in a puzzle. He may have believed that actors are cattle, but one can tell from watching his films that he knows the importance of characters. His dialogue is natural yet profound, and while depicting catch phrases and fads from that era would make the movies seem dated, the intelligent, understated way he talks about the issues of his time here and there make the movies seem like they are proudly representing their time. The difference is the difference between decay and grandeur, between the many ephemeral leaders of Rome and the never-fading Roman culture.The acting is more than fine. Cary Grant, one of the legends, puts on a believable and thorough performance. In some of the quieter scenes, it is what makes the film work. Eva Marie Saint, another legend (and a blonde, as most women are in Hitchcock movies) adds spice and edge to a role that would have been ordinary had it been performed by a less actress.On a side note, I don't think I'm the only one who finds it just a bit creepy to watch someone act on the screen when they're now dead, like Grant, and even more bizarre when they're still alive but have aged quite a bit since their role, like Ms. Saint, who is alive and in her nineties at the time of this review.Hitchcock is known as the Mater of Suspense and this film shows you why; it takes all sorts of twists and turns. One of the trademarks of Hitchcock films is their ability to appear like they're one type of film before seamlessly yet starkly transitioning to another. The Birds went from a screwball Pythonesque comedy to a horror film, Psycho from a heist film to a dark twisted thriller. I have seen no other director that can pull off this trick so well. In this film, we go from a more mysterious psychological movie to more of an espionage adventure tale; it's not as jarring of a shift, but it is a shift nonetheless.The score represents Hitchcock's best on that front. Scores like this are the reason why an unscored movie like The Birds or a softly scored flick like Rear Window come as such a shock. This score is big and booming and dynamic. Yes, the fifties were riddled with over the top scores (it's actually one of the best ways to identify a film as being from that decade) but Hitchcock knows how to use it in a way that cuts the through the inherent cheesiness of the idea (though I still can't stifle a chuckle every time it gets real intense) and turn it into an impressive cinematic tool the underscore the many important moments of the film. Give the soundtrack a listen; it is perhaps even more impressive when give a listen away from the film.If I was given one word and only one word to describe this movie, I would choose iconic. This is the sort of movie that deserves to be watched, to be passed down from generation to generation and held up as one of the hallmarks of great cinema. Watch and take in what has been honored for generations and has, like landmarks of many other sorts, affected the lives of many, including me, during that time.",North by Northwest
265,alexdeleonfilm,The coolest movie ever made: Hitchcock's Ninth Symphony,10,21 July 2017,"image4.jpegAction and suspense: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies.Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth). The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of. Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the slickest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the slickest pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived. Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheat fields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger. Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him. So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89. NBNW is frequently rerun on TV so it's not hard to catch up with but it never gets old or fails to make you hold your breath even when you know what's coming next. An ultimate classic.",North by Northwest
266,commandercool88,Hitchcock Goes Mainstream,10,14 January 2009,"'North by Northwest' is not as experimental as 'Psycho'. Nor is it as confined as 'Rear Window' or as disturbing as 'Vertigo'. What it is, however, is a mainstream Hitchcock presenting an endlessly entertaining effort. One of the most satisfying spy thrillers, this case of mistaken identity plays out like an intelligent and explosive cat and mouse chase.Hitchcock was always one to maintain tight control over every set, every shot. He loosens his reigns in 'North by Northwest' by making the United States of America his playing field. From New York to Chicago to Mount Rushmore, this captivating thriller is a grandiose and ambitious picture from the master of suspense. The result is a brilliantly realized picture whose entertainment value could rival today's Bond.Cary Grant is electrifying as Roger Thornhill, an unsuspecting man mistaken for a mysterious Kaplan. His journey to keep his life becomes a mad dash to escape the hands of the law, and around every corner Grant faces a looming threat. Eva Marie Saint is fantastic as Grant's romantic interest who has much more invested in Thornhill than he ever suspects. The chemistry between the two is unmistakable, making every twist and turn along the way a brilliant sleight of hand only Hitchcock can deliver.From a heart pounding chase in the middle of a cornfield to a thrilling climax on the face of Mount Rushmore, 'North by Northwest' provides many memorable moments that make this classic a wild ride from start to finish. Sweeping cinematography and vivid imagery only adds to this thrilling, funny, and romantic adventure that span across amber waves of grain and purple mountain majesties. 'North by Northwest' may very well be Hitchcock's most mainstream effort, and you'll savor every moment of it.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",North by Northwest
267,Det_McNulty,It's The Irony That Makes The Script Have So Much Originality and Intelligence,9,3 September 2006,"I've always considered Hitchcock one of the finest directors in the way he can retain such versatility and have consistent quality of film throughout his entire career. Hitchcock was a master at creating and reviving genres; this personally never ceases to amaze me. North By Northwest could have so easily of been a ""run of the mill"" thriller that had no elements of comedy or any kind of style. Luckily it makes a fast-paced piece of weekend entertainment.North By Northwest turns everything upside down. The quirky story of the film reacts to the surroundings so well and the famous locations are great choices for chase scenes and adrenaline action. This was action before action was really a genre and the classy script will make the viewer feel extremely satisfied. The script adds the comedy to the film and Cary Grant's tremendous style and class A acting ability is something one can never tire of. For example, the scene in the lift where everyone is laughing, Cary Grant's expression is just priceless. Cary Grant's acting ability impresses throughout the film and remains cool and collected. Cary Grant makes a clumsy/un-predictable ""James Bond"" in North By Northwest and it remains one of his most iconic films that he starred in.Some may find the film hard to take seriously because it is very different to how you'd expect a Hitchcock film to be, yet it still has his trademark written all over it. The reason for this is the fact the story is goofy. The chemistry and added romance in the film works very well with the surrounding and creates a great atmosphere. The obvious sexual tensions that are scattered throughout the film show that North By Northwest was ahead of its time. The sexual innuendo is a high point for the film and the script's fast paced rhythm is what keeps the film moving so well.Hitchcock's direction works perfectly with the film and the vast variety of skills shows in some of the action scenes prove to be very exciting. The ""mother"" attitude that is scattered throughout the film remains one of Hitchcock's trademark styles, which he then uses in his latter work ""Psycho"". Bar none one of the highest octane and entertaining films ever made, slick, stylish, sexy and downright thrilling.",North by Northwest

269,alexx668,North by Northwest,8,28 December 2006,"One of the best Hitchcock films, ""North By Northwest"" can be interpreted on many levels. On one hand this is a suspense extravaganza, with the plot featuring more twists and turns than a roller-coaster ride, and with some of the most impressive sequences ever, particularly the airplane scene and the chase at Mount Rushmore. This is impeccably shot, and it shows. Even the love affair between the 2 protagonists takes advantage of the settings, displaying irony and cynicism.On the other hand, as a character study this is even more interesting. Roger Thornhill, your average middle-class advertising executive leading a dull life, out of a twist of fate is mistaken for a government spy, and becomes the target for the criminal group of Phillip Vandamm. The film's intense pace takes the form of a dream, a person that loses control of his life and then transforms to the person he's mistaken for. Roger Thornhill, half by accident and half by his own will transforms to spy decoy George Kaplan.The board of government spy directors, led by the Professor, represents the forces that control destiny. They control both Eve Kendall's and Thornhill's fate. And they choose to dispatch with Thornhill altogether since he doesn't fit the general scheme of things. Thornhill gets entangled in a Kafka-esquire nightmare. Kendall, the femme fatale, is a government spy herself trying to uncover Vandamm by working closely on his side and being his lover. A Freudian labyrinth.Thornhill manages to be in charge of his own destiny, to the point where he gets to play a vital role to the people around him. The government now wants to use him, Eve Kendall falls in love with him but he also jeopardizes her mission, and ditto for Vandamm, now sure that Thornhill really is Kaplan. The surprising ending also contributes to the film's dream-like feel, with a sudden switch from a near-death scene to a generic happy ending. It can be translated two ways, either an ironic take on film endings, or Thornhill's fantasy. A fantasy within a fantasy.",North by Northwest

271,Gambitt,Good movie but needs some work,7,5 November 2003,"North by Northwest is a fine film, but hey, did you notice that it's over 40 years old?  I say it's due for a good ol' Hollywood remake!  Just think what can be achieved and how much better the movie can be with modern CGI and fresh, young talent.First off, casting is vital.  Cary Grant may have been an uber-stud back in the 50s, but he's way too Ward Cleaver for today's hip audience.  I recommend Will Smith or the Rock.  Replacing Eva Marie Saint would be an accomplished actress like Cameron Diaz or Jessica Simpson.  And for the villainous Vandamm, go with Agent Smith from the Matrix.  Also, I don't know what role they would play, but squeeze DMX and Jet Li in there somehow. Cause I mean, you put those two together and it's like gold every time!Now Hitchcock's plot is involving enough but it might be a bit too slow for today's kids.  Fortunately I have lots of great ideas.  In the drunk car chase scene, replace the pursuers' car with an M1 Abrams tank and instead of a convertible, Thornhill should be in either a hovercraft or a Hummer H2.The scene where Thornhill is being attacked by the cropduster is perfect; just use a stealth fighter instead, have it happen in Times Square, and have Thornhill shoot down the plane with a bazooka; oh, and it should be done all in slow-mo.  Finally, the last scene should end with Mt. Rushmore exploding as Thornhill/Kendall jump off the top screaming ""COWABUNGA TO THE EXTREME, YO!""But otherwise the movie is perfect as is!

Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is kidnapped by two thugs working for a crafty criminal, played by James Mason; Grant is mistaken for purely someone else. He finds himself soon taken with Eve Kendall, a beautiful-yet-cold woman played excellently by Eva Marie Saint, who is a double agent for all practical purposes, working for the CIA(?) and the crafty criminal who must be caught. Grant is his suave self, and Eva Marie Saint is very appealing.Yes, it is easier for him to solve the mystery into which he is unvoluntarily absorbed than to win Eva Kendall's affection. The three settings (New York, Chicago, and Mount Rushmore) contribute to the intrigue of the movie. The climb around Mount Rushmore is tense, though, of course, it is not the real mount itself, just a large, convincing replica. The South Dakota scenery, however, is beautiful, the comical aspects of the movie are entertaining, and the well-constructed a la Alfred Hitchcock plot maintains well the viewers' (viewer's) attention. An outstanding cinematic feat for Mr. Hitchcock.",North by Northwest
273,andrewmerritt-31652,One crazy roller coaster,10,8 December 2019,"North by Northwest stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film revolves around an advertising executive named Roger Thornhill who is mistaken for another man named George Kaplan who is forced to go on the run from the government as well as a secret organization who is out looking to kill him. There are two ways of looking at this film. One is just looking at this picture as your standard plot with your typical protagonist and antagonist. But the second way is looking at this in a psychological way. Meaning did all of this actually happen or did he create this fantasy just to escape his boring mundane life? Or another way you can look at this is Roger Thornhill and George Kaplan the same person? And this movie isn't built or structured like a psychological thriller like some of Hitchcock's other movies. But this is Alfred Hitchcock were talking about here. And no other director can take this concept and turn it into a psychological film. Only he can turn a simple concept into something that will make you question your own sanity and have you dissect each frame and shot of the film. That's why this movie is so brilliant as we journey down the rabbit hole inside of Roger Thornhill's warped and twisted mind as he tries to solve the mystery that makes us never leave. I never found myself bored or irritated because I didn't want the journey to end as Alfred Hitchcock hypnotizes the viewer into joining him on this crazy adventure. And the adventure never stops as we have different genres like action, adventure, romance, and comedy all wrapped up in a nice bow. And all these different genres fit so perfectly together that you can sit back and relax without ever scathing your head in confusion. In the end this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time that it has become the inspiration for movies that borrow the same plot, but they will never live up to this. What makes this North by Northwest so brilliant to watch is that you forget your watching a two and a half hour and that the studio and everyone on board put in their sweat and tears to deliver an entertaining movie. And it's no surprise that this film is listed in AFI's top 10 mystery films of all time. So overall, this is by far one of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movies that is definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it.",North by Northwest
274,cafescott,Grant's nightmare is our gain,10,16 July 2014,"***Nycritic has an interesting discussion comparing NXNW with the James Bond franchise (""What an Action Thriller Should Be"", nycritic, 11 April 2005). Also, Ian Harrison has a good discussion about identification with Cary Grant (""Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!"", Ian Harrison from Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, 25 December 2000).***""North by Northwest"" (1959, Alfred Hitchcock), a travelogue, has inspired many. This includes Ian Fleming who created the character of James Bond as a derivation of Cary Grant's Roger O. Thornhill. Many young filmmakers have also studied this film to unlock its secrets. Despite its ludicrous plot (which is a Hitchcock characteristic), it is overflowing with style. NXNW is exquisitely fine art with strong appeal to the masses. Someday, Alfred Hitchcock may dislodge William Shakespeare in public regard.As with every film by the Master, each image was carefully designed before the filming. The sequences are dazzling with precision. The sublime crop-duster, auction, drunken-driving and Mount Rushmore scenes all reach a level of quality that is hard to believe. NXNW is of course, best viewed on the big screen. Since the Charles Theater has completed renovating its showcase theater this is a great opportunity to luxuriate in the new seats and experience a real gem.There are sight gags aplenty. We know from Francois Truffaut's famous interview with him that visually Hitchcock was mocking Grant's sexuality. Ergo, making Cary appear uninterested in women is a prominent visual leitmotif. (Although he always denied it, Grant was widely believed in Hollywood to be bisexual. He shared a house for a decade with fellow actor Randolph Scott, and the two were often observed relaxing as if they were lovers. It seems worth noting that the media of the 1930s largely let ""sleeping dogs lie""; i.e., Grant suffered little exposure in the press. It may be difficult for people living in this Peeping Tom era to imagine the privacy people in the 1930s enjoyed.)Here, Cary Grant is never better. The rest of the cast is noteworthy. Silky-voiced James Mason (as Phillip Vandamm) is wonderful to listen to. Hitchcock's villains are always charming, but Mason's particular voice is so sonorous it is the perfect antidote to Grant's mega-watt charisma. Eva Marie Saint (age: 35) is also very effective as a sultry spy. Martin Landau plays the obviously homosexual assistant to Van Damm. Leo G. Carroll, the actor with the most appearances in Hitchcock films (5), is the sympathetic spy master. Jessica Royce Landis, (believed to be) only 8 years older than Grant, plays his mother with comedic flair. Bernard Hermann provides another great film score.Studio executives quarreled with Hitchcock over NXNW's running time (136 minutes). The bean counters wanted to trim scenes, particularly Cary and Eva Marie in the woods. Hitchcock had his way because his contract granted him final cut. Good thing the brief hospital scene was not left out. When a startled female patient immediately falls in love with passing-through Grant, the moment never fails to bring laughter. Even today, Cary Grant will likely poll as the most handsome actor in cinema history.The last time I saw NXNW screened in a theater I was very surprised how much more thrilling and emotionally warm experiencing it is instead of watching it on a TV screen. The next time this appears at a movie house near you, do not hesitate to arrive by bus, cab, train and airplane to experience it; avoiding offensive crop-duster pilots on the journey.",North by Northwest
275,Mike_Yike,One Of The Greatest Movies Ever,10,28 December 2018,"I remember seeing this as a kid in 1959. I do not remember the venue (it was a long time ago) but it may well have been at a drive-in with my sisters and parents. I thought it was a great movie then and I still do (I watched it all the way through last night for about the 10th time). It has a couple of iconic scenes. One is the evil crop dusting plane on a lonely country road. The other is of course the chase on the Mt. Rushmore monument.
About 10 years ago I found a couple of minor snafus that, to be honest, bother me a bit. One is that Cary Grant decides to take a train to Rapid City to root out his adversary. Somehow Eve Kendall, played by Eva-Marie Saint, happens to be on that train. She is the love interest/government spy of the protagonist. What are the odds of such a thing? A little too slim for me to find it acceptable. The other minor problem I had was that the head of the secret government operations, called The Professor (and played by Leo G. Carroll), was constantly in plain sight in a number of scenes. Would the same man be at an auction in Chicago and then appear again in the visitor's center at Mt. Rushmore?Anyway, a few tiny things have to be dismissed. No big deal. It is a remarkable film with a remarkable cast and director.",North by Northwest

Reluctant in finding the real agent, he goes on a quest. As the plot unravels and gets more complicated, he finds out the agent never existed (spoilers), and it was a decoy planted by the FBI. But now that he's assumed the role of the agent, he's enlisted to become the agent he was trying to prove he was not. It will make your head explode!Cary Grant is phenomenal in the role, making quick comebacks and speaking rapidly; you would believe that someone with his personality would get in such a mess. It feels like a precursor to a James Bond movie or an Indiana Jones movie in my opinion: a suspenseful thriller that works as a comedy all rolled into one.The screenplay, written by Ernest Lehman, keeps the viewer guessing but also provides answers in a timely fashion. For example, when things start going wrong for the protagonist near the beginning, we aren't forced to wait until the closing scenes to uncover the plot against him. Enough clues are provided early that the intelligent viewer can deduce what's going on and move to the next mystery. Such intellectual participation, always a Hitchcock hallmark, is sadly lacking in most of today's so-called ""thrillers.""As is the case with many of Hitchcock's films, the director sets up his hero as the only one who knows the truth. His story is so preposterous that no one else believes him without a great deal of convincing. We, of course, sympathize with the hero immediately, because we know that he's sane and is the victim of a conspiracy - even though we don't understand what that conspiracy entails.Of course, the hallmark of North by Northwest is the way in which Hitchcock develops tension. It only takes one introductory scene - the one with Thornhill and his secretary in a cab - for us to lend our sympathy to the hero. From that point, with a lone exception, we see things through his eyes. There is only one scene in which we are given information that the protagonist is not privy to - when the camera takes us into a government office to shed light on Thornhill's situation while adding deeper layers to the mystery. In fact, it's the complexity of Thornhill's trap and the seeming impossibility of getting out of it that builds suspense.Hitchcock introduces strong comedic elements into this film. The result doesn't diffuse the tension, but offers an occasional break from it. For a '50s film, North by Northwest is also surprisingly forthright when it comes to sexual matters. There aren't many euphemisms or double entendres in the interaction between Thornhill and Eve.From the brisk strains of Bernard Herrmann's opening-title fandango to its concluding gag of a honeymoon train speeding into a tunnel, North by Northwest is the apotheosis of Alfred Hitchcock's exploration of the wrong-man-pursued comic thriller and functioned in 1959 as a summary of the Master's career to date. Few films can be a showcase to the art of great film making (considered from a purely entertainment perspective). North by Northwest is one of them. I recommend renting it and watching it on as large a screen as possible",North by Northwest
278,nnnn45089191,"Playful,exciting Hitchcock thriller",10,5 August 2007,"Hitchcock's most entertaining masterpiece is a delight to sit through. The 2 hours + running time moves so fast,you're surprised when the movie is over.Hitchcock keeps the pace going and it never lets up.If the suspense might drag he inserts some clever comedy relief. Cary Grant is absolutely fantastic in the lead-role.James Mason makes the perfect gentleman crook,Eva Marie Saint is sexy and wonderful and Martin Landau is deliciously sinister as Mason's gay henchman.The movie is full of great set-pieces with the famous crop-dusting scene the most spectacular. My favorite scene is at the auction. How Grant gets out of his predicament is one of the movie's highlights.Although Hitchcock's themes repeated themselves ,his best films were always original and exciting. In a way he had made this movie earlier. ""The 39 Steps (1935)"" and ""Saboteur (1942)"" have similar story lines. But this is really one of the classic masterpieces of the cinema.",North by Northwest

Not only does it star Cary Grant--still (at age 55) and always one of the best-looking leading actors ever, it's directed by Alfred Hitchcock, co-stars Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Martin Landau, and has a brilliant script. I'd expected something scary and suspenseful in an atmospheric way, and I *did* get that--but 'North By Northwest' is so much more. It has incredible dialogue, for one thing, played to the hilt by Grant (surely the best and most subtle comedic actor ever). And that's still not all! Comedic element aside, it's also a romance film (check out the scenes between Grant and Saint: some of them border on pseudo-funny, but most of them are electric), an action flick (the scene on Mount Rushmore, the exhilarating cropduster scene), and a good old-fashioned spy thriller. Definitely two of the best hours I've ever spent in a cinema (I didn't want the film to end, and when it did, I didn't want to leave!), and hours I will happily spend again in front of the television, rewatching this film on DVD. 10/10!",North by Northwest
283,richard-wheeler,A 50s classic.,8,17 October 2005,"This was a film we were studying in English this year to do with film, film shots , what the music represents and angles. Film, it interests me so much. That is what I am going to get involved in once I have finished school.It was about a man named Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) who got kidnapped and was taken to a residence called ""Townsend"" to meet Mr. Lester Townsend (Philip Ober). And from there, the people who he met thought he was ""George Caplin"". A person who did not exist. Roger noticed some other strange things : being asked questions that he cannot answer and doors being locked from behind him. And worse, he was forced to gulp down a full glass of a "" Burman"".Later on in the evening, Roger was put into a Mercedes-Benz when he was totally out of it, the car was started up for him and he was about to go over a cliff. Ooh! That point of view shot freaked me out while Roger looked down the cliff. Jeepers! I sure am afraid of heights! And then, he woke up, took hold of the steering wheel and he did his best to drive. I am too afraid to drive when I am drunk because, I know I will CRASH! IT'S BLOODY Frightening!!! There was a scene that amused me when Roger crashed into the back of a car and followed by a cop's car crashing into the back of the stolen car he was driving! Everywhere where Roger goes, no one believes him that he was about to be killed by a bunch of madmen; not even the police. They just think he was a drunkard misbehaving.The next day, Roger went to Townsend's with the cops and his mother Clara Thornhill (Jessie Royce Landis) to prove what happened at Townsend's place. Fortunately, the evidence had vanished. And soon, at Roger's hotel room, he received a call from the man who tried to kill him on the previous evening and he saw him and his gang where ever he went. Spooky. And everywhere he went, he was known as George Caplin.After the strange call, Roger approached the General Assembly Building (United Nations) where he met the real Lester Townsend and Townsend told Roger that his wife had been dead for years and the house had been closed up leaving the gardener and the housekeeper to look after it. Then, Roger showed a photograph to Townsend, he gasped and Roger's killer vanished when he was observing the situation from far away. And now, it had gotten WORSE! Roger had been accused of theft, murder and violence.There was another scene that crept me out, that was when the people who tried to kill Roger were cleverly disguised as cops. And Roger was seen on front covers of newspapers everywhere due to all the trouble he accidentally caused . For example, when the ticket officer saw him asking for a ticket, he called security. Then Roger suddenly disappeared and sneaked into a train and bumped into a woman named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). She did not believe that Roger was a criminal and then she fell in love with him. How sweet.Soon, Roger disguised himself as a cop and he got onto a bus and he was dropped off in the middle of nowhere. Suddenly, a plane appeared out of nowhere and it tried to attack him. THAT WAS NASTY! And all the cars on the road ignored the event and then; Roger dived into a corn patch and the plane came flying down pouring out pesticides. As quick as a flash, Roger made a run for it,he stopped in the middle of the road, stopped a truck, the people who were inside the truck got out and the plane crashed into the truck. It was quite an explosion! And while no one was looking , Roger took off in a truck and drove to go see Eve. Ans suddenly, Roger noticed everywhere that every article was talking about the plane crash incident. Gosh! When will it end? Roger soon bumped into Profeesor (Leo. G. Carroll) and he was going to find out that it was the Professor who stared this Caplin business. Anyways, Roger and Eve took off to a house that was close to Mt. Rushmore and there , they got caught by a servant with a gun and were forced to come inside and sit down. And outside the house, [ full shot], a gun shot was heard, Roger and Eve ran out , got into the car and drove off into the woods with a strange statue.Now here, was a moment filled with action, suspense and full and medium shots as Eve and Roger climbed down Mt. Rushmore with the crooks after them. And from a high angle full shot, Roger attacked one of the crooks and they fell down Mt. Rushmore. WOW! And suddenly, Eve was attacked by another crook and Roger came to her rescue with all the crooks and cops watching. And to end this review, Roger and Eve took off on a train, kissed and made up.North by Northwest was a movie filled with suspense, scares, the unexpected and hectic music which explains insanity. This was a very entertaining 50s action thriller classic. I would like to thank the English department of my school St. Peter's College for sharing this film and movie techniques with us, the Grade 11s (standard 9s). I am sure they all appreciated it.

Initially i thought, that due to their age, they would not fare well against more recent movies. I could not have been more wrong.North by Northwest on a big widescreen in Dolby 5.1 surround is simply great. Sure some of the dialogue seems clumsy and dated, but you have to consider the type of censorship that would have existed when this film was released in 1959. The sort of ""colourful"" language we take for granted today would never have been allowed. Also some of the ""special effects"" are lame by today's standards.

293,donuthaters12,It's Age And Influence Has Impacted This Film's Strengths,9,3 December 2013,"Hitchcock is highly praised by critics and the general public as one of the most influential directors of his time and they are not wrong. I have not yet seen all of Hitchcock's work but I have seen most of his films that are commonly regarded as ""essential"". North By Northwest is one of those ""essential"" films and it was the one that I felt was the weakest. I am sure that most people will disagree with me but this is how I perceived it after viewing the film three times.North By Northwest is written by Ernest Lehman, who has worked on highly regarded films like The Sound of Music, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and a personal favorite of mine Sabrina. Lehman has written very ambitious films, showing off things that other writers have not yet thought of. North By Northwest is a prime example on how grand his vision was for the action thriller. The film's premise is quite funny and it does get you intrigued. The film starts small, then it gets bigger and bigger as the film progresses. The set pieces in the film are daring and at times ridiculous (though not entirely in a bad way). My main issue with the script is the way the protagonist is written. Roger Thornhill is too self-centred and at times cocky for his own good which many may appealingly engaging, I found it to be difficult for me to show any empathy or sympathy of his unfortunate conditions. Towards the end of the film there is a moment where Thornhill and Eve Kendall discuss about being together and this is the first time where Thornhill showed some sort of emotional vulnerability and had me caring and started to see the side of him that was not shown earlier.Alfred Hitchcock is not shy in pushing the boundaries once in a while, and this one is definitely a huge push. This Hitchcock film has definitely inspired many action/thriller films in the future and still being used as inspiration in modern filmmaking. I do admire the fact that Hitchcock wants us following a man who in most situations is helpless to do anything. North By Northwest is a film that contains the most memorable action sequences, but ironically the main reason that these set pieces lacked the impact for me is the influence it has made on contemporary films. These scenes have time and time again been replicated and taken inspiration from it that when I actually give this a watch, it loses the magic that these scenes can give off. The effects that are used in this film are very ambitious, and because of this ambition it has aged poorly as time passes. Though these is heading towards late Hitchcock, he still has not lost his touch to create mystery and suspense.Robert Burks is a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock starting from Strangers on a Train and ending with Marnie (The only film between that he did not work in was Psycho). The relationship between Hitchcock and Burks are an example where both members are in tune with one another. Burks understands Hitchcock's vision, this is why the films they work together are very different from one another and each one has their own style. North By Northwest may be the biggest film that they both have worked on, second being To Catch A Thief. Burks has chosen very wide and huge shots of the environment that the action is taking place, which is one of the key factors that makes this film feel large and ambitious. The crop duster scene or the climax are the key moments where his photography shines. Personally, I much prefer Burks' work on Rear Window and Vertigo but North By Northwest is a force of its own that it cannot be dismissed.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who has worked on the most iconic of films delivering the most iconic of scores. North By Northwest's score is an example of that brilliant craft with an upbeat and tense composition that sticks with you throughout the movie. The score often builds up throughout and then the action and suspense occurs then it comes in full force. It adds on to the sense of desperation to survive which is something Roger Thornhill constantly has to go through.Cary Grant is the protagonist of this film and I'm just going to say that currently I am not a fan of him. I am not sure whether it's the roles he picks, or that I just haven't seen enough of his films. Grant comes off here as a hero or invincible even though he is meant to play a man who is very vulnerable and lacks the skills to survive in the face of danger. Grant constantly has an answer for everything and has a sarcastic joke to say with every response, but this may be more due to the writing than his acting abilities. Eva Marie Saint is another member Hitchcock's list of leading ladies but if I had to rank them, she isn't up there with Grace Kelly and Janet Leigh. Saint still does her role well though, able to project that sexuality that many actresses cannot do and still maintains to be just as equally witty and as Grant. James Mason was a treat to see, he brings this class in his role as the antagonist of the film. The accent and delivery of his lines make gives him a unique quality that other actors of it's time just lack.North By Northwest will stand the test of time as a classic but in a personal level it just didn't impact me the same way as Rear Window or Psycho had on me. I came into this film open minded with every time I watch it and it does get better with each viewing.",North by Northwest

He gets in a car, goes to a meeting, excuses himself to make a phone call and is abducted and taken to an estate, where he's accused of being someone else. He protests (vainly) and is then forced to drink down until drunkenness and nearly run off a cliff before taking the wheel itself; at this point one starts wondering if Grant would have done a passable 007, but I digress...Thornhill spends the rest of the movie on the lam, running from the police after being mistaken for an assassin at the United Nations and mistaken for an CIA decoy as well.

298,barevfilm,Hitchcock's Ninth Symphony,10,22 November 2018,"Action and suspense: A hapless New York advertising executive is mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies,
Asking which is the best Hitchcock is something like asking which is the best Beethoven symphony, but if pressed to the wall I would call NBNW Hitchcock's Ninth (and Psycho, his Fifth).
The coolest of Grant and the hottest of Marie Saint is simply
the coolest film ever made from every angle you can think of.
Few people would contend that Cary Grant was not the coolest leading man of Hollywood's golden age but this pic is the peak of his coolness, along with that the coolest James Mason ever as the smoothest polite villain of all time and the slinkiest Eva Marie Saint ever, all adds up to one of the most satisfying pieces of celluloid entertainment ever conceived.
Most Hitchcock movies have one unforgettable white knuckle cliff hanger sequence but NBNW has two -- the chase out in the wheatfields by a poisonous crop duster biplane and the final chase across the faces of the four presidents at Mount Rushmore, which ends up literally ... as a cliffhanger.
Even a third if you include the comical auction scene where Grant keeps making outrageous bids to attract the police and thus escape the clutches of the killers lurking in the room waiting to get him.
So much has been written about this picture that there is no need to recount the plot other to say that it is a towering masterpiece of the romantic suspense drama genre with all players at the top of their game - and don't forget a young menacing Martin Landau as Mason's cold blooded sidekick, another great actor who just passed away on July 15, 2017 at age 89.

299,tripper0,doesn't entirely hold up today.....,9,22 June 2002,"Most of this film holds up entirely well by today's standards.  There is excellent suspense and some extremely memorable scenes, specifically the one of the plane chasing Cary Grant.  The only real problem with the movie is the famous Mount Rushmore sequence.  Most of the time Hitchcock never relied on special effects to create suspense, and it doesn't stand the test of time here. We've been treated to some amazing looking things as of late, and its hard to believe that the characters are in any real danger while they are supposedly on the face(no pun intended)of the mountain.  Its a shame, because up until that point the film was perfect.  Cary Grant plays his part well, a very suave man, and his usual fast talking self.  Eva Marie Saint is a great partner for Grant.  Of Grant's Hitchcock movies (including 'Notorious' and 'To Catch a Thief') I feel that this was the best chemistry he had with the lead actress, and I mean no disrespect to Ingrid Bergman or Grace Kelly, who are both brilliant.  Hitchcock's direction is superb, which should come as no surprise.  The beauty of this film is that it is Hitchcock on autopilot.  'Vertigo', made the year before this film, was a movie that you really had to pay attention to to get all the details.  It's nice to see that he made complex movies as well as great suspense movies that are extremely well paced and very entertaining.  It was what Hitch liked the best I think, a wrongly accused man involved in an international plot he knows nothing about.  Would have been perfect if not for the Mount Rushmore scene.  9.5 out of 10.",North by Northwest
300,SendiTolver,They said I led too dull a life.,10,12 September 2018,"One can argue about is 'North by Northwest' the best movie in the long list of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, but it is definitely his most entertaining one. Escapist and unrealistic, sure, but all the characters, their motivations, actions and events depicted on the screen are believable in their own universe that Hitchcock directed based on Ernest Lehman's screenplay. The dialogue is witty and filled with amusing innuendos, and although it might seem that it is all game for the characters, the imminent threat is always present, and doesn't give the viewer (or the characters) too much time to rest from head spinning action. One aspect that is truly amazing (especially for a film like this) is that none of the characters were irritating, especially those who were totally ignorant for the obvious - the police officers and main character's mother (Jessie Royce Landis - what a wonderful performance), who didn't take seriously one single word that Roger Thornhill said about his situation. Cary Grant, who mostly played himself in his later movies (he did that wonderfully, I might add), gives one of his best performances as Roger Thornhill, a man who is mistaken as government agent and later falsely accused of crime he didn't commit. Eva Marie Saint equally shines as Eve Kendall, a woman whose intentions are unclear. Chemistry between the two leads make the screen sizzle (take that implication how you want) and it is pure enjoyment to watch these two playfully overcome all threats and obstacles.

301,bull-frog,A bit disappointed,7,13 April 2007,"Just finished watching Hitchcock's ""Signature Collection"" which comprised: Strangers on a Train / North by Northwest / Dial M for Murder / Foreign Correspondent / Suspicion / The Wrong Man / Stage Fright / I Confess / Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Knowing that North by Northwest was the highest rated movie of the lot, I save the ""best"" for last.I was a little disappointed as I thought the plot, while probably original for it's time, seemed quite ordinary by today's standards. However, the strongest suit of this film is the artistic quality. Hitchcock does an extraordinary job. The camera work is fantastic, the backgrounds are stunning, and the color schemes are beautiful.I watched this movie twice. The first time I rated it a six and this time a seven. I understood it better the second time but still couldn't help notice holes in the plot. I still couldn't understand Thornhill's obsession with Eve, even though she almost got him killed by directing him to the cornfields. And I couldn't determine what was the purpose of the microfilm that fell out at the end.The villains play a confusing role in this film. I actually had to read other posters comments in order to figure out why the villains wanted Thornhill so bad.There are also some obvious continuity errors. For example, the movie starts off in New York City. Yet in the car chase we see sharp jagged mountains right next to the coast. The setting looked more like the West Coast than NYC.",North by Northwest
302,mitch-bulfin,NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) - 18/10/2019,8,10 March 2020,"I don't know if the film is busy enough to be a real wild ride, but for its time, and even now, it really is really fun, and while you shouldn't really expect the dramatic weight found in many of Hitchcock's other thrillers, style, intrigue and entertainment value converge tightly enough to make this one of, if not the legendary filmmaker's crowning achievement. When the run is done, the final product goes worn down by dramatic limitations, as well as tonal unevenness, believability lapses and, of course, an overblown structure, but through excellent score work by Bernard Herrmann, sharp cinematography by Robert Burks, thoroughly clever writing by Ernest Lehman, an electrically charismatic lead performance by Cary Grant, and a lively directorial performance by Alfred Hitchcock, all behind a grandly adventurous and intriguing story concept, ""North by Northwest"" stands strong as a thoroughly entertaining affair that may be Hitchcock's most realized classic.Mitchell Bulfin",North by Northwest

Yes this movie longer than other Hitchcock films but it felt longer than 3 hours, probably because of the ever growing plot lines and characters switching sides from 2nd or 3rd agent.I loved when the movie shifted to a smaller settings, train scene was well crafted.It is in a sense a action movie but I started watching Hitchcock to the escape the current blockbustery action films.The making of crop-duster sequence deserves all credit it can get and it was fun well it lasted but the movie as a whole felt it drag a lot.",North by Northwest
304,michaelheiser-25099,Powerful film,8,8 November 2021,"Powerful film with many twists and turns. These conflicting traits are all found in ""North by Northwest"". It's at once Hitchcock's most famous thriller, and his longest, most lazily paced. Its at once an expressionist nightmare, and a slapstick popcorn comedy built around Cary Grant's own slapstick past. Its at once a lean silent thriller, and a bloated big budget production. These contrasts lend the film an interesting quality, but would also negatively influence over a century of copycat Hollywood thrillers which trawl for demographics and try madly to be everything to everyone all at once. Every year ""Northwest"" is released a couple dozen times under a different name, some new running man wrongly accused of something whilst tracking down a McGuffin in an attempt to solve some completely arbitrary problem. In each case the objective is the same: to construct a roller coaster plot which exists solely to facilitate action scenes.Francois Truffaut picked up on this decades ago: ""The most appealing aspect of these sequences is that they're totally gratuitous. [...] It's a scene that's been drained of all plausibility or even significance. But it's precisely that gratuity - which you're criticised for - that gives the scene all of its interest and strength. How can anyone object to gratuity when it's so clearly deliberate?",North by Northwest
305,Speechless,Great but FLAWED (some mild spoilers),10,5 March 2001,"I won't bother with any of that nonsense about how this is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Everybody knows that, and if anyone tries to tell you otherwise, let me know so I can stamp the word IDIOT on their forehead.  But the movie has a terrible, terrible flaw that needs to be addressed.Simply put, Hitchcock should have cut that early scene where the intelligence agency members discuss what they are going to do now that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan.  It's an awful scene.  For one thing, the scene is incredibly poorly written in comparison with the rest of the film--the characters say everything over and over again, in the simplest terms possible, as though they think we're all too stupid to figure anything out.  More importantly, though, the scene completely ruins the mystery of George Kaplan way too early in the film.  Imagine if that scene were removed.  Then we'd be closer to Thornhill's plight throughout the entire movie--when he sees that guy at the cornfield, we'd think that was Kaplan, just like Thornhill does.  And then when the professor guy shows up at the airport, we'd all be like, ""Okay, now that HAS to be Kaplan.""  And we'd learn the truth about Kaplan right along with Thornhill.  But that dumb scene at the beginning spoils the mystery, and unfortunately that keeps us from relating with Thornhill as much as we otherwise might have.Don't let any of this stop you from seeing the movie.  It's wonderful.  But while you watch it, think about what it might have been.",North by Northwest

Cary Grant is wonderful in this part, and so are the rest of the cast. Mason was never better than here and Saint has her best part since On the Waterfront. The cinematography is masterful, especially during the legendary crop duster sequence. The musical score is memorable and the editing is also very good.
The plot can get a little convoluted at times, but it does not falter this otherwise great experience.
North By Northwest may not be better than some of Hitchcock's other films such as Rear Window or Vertigo, but it deserves its duel title of classic and masterpiece.",North by Northwest
307,mikepwong,A good action thriller,8,27 October 2001,"I gave North by Northwest an 8 out of 10. This is a really entertaining movie by Alfred Hitchcock. It keeps the viewer glued to the screen since you don't want to miss any key moments. As always with Hitchcock movies, the casting is excellent. Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason are all great to watch. I've read that the Mount Rushmore scene was an actual movie set since Hitchcock was not able to use the real thing. That was a very impressive set they made, it's too bad that the set designers did not win the academy award for set decoration. They were nominated though.From the user comments on this website, it does seem that North by Northwest is a fan favourite. I suppose that's because this Hitchcock film is a bit lighter and comedic compared to the others. I really did like this movie, but if I had a choice to watch a Hitchcock movie again, I'd probably pick Vertigo or Rear Window instead of this one.",North by Northwest
308,movieman9,Top-notch suspense /adventure film still looks great after 40 years!,10,25 December 2000,"For Christmas this year, I received my first to-own DVD: Hitchcock's classic, NORTH BY NORTHWEST. After over 40 years, this rip-racing adventure-thriller still packs a punch and looks great on widescreen. This movie came along during a renaissance period for the Old Master, between masterpieces like VERTIGO and PSYCHO, but this excursion into the world of suspense is so different from anything else Hitchcock had created up to that point. Never did he challenge our endurance to keep still in our seats for such a long period of time, and yet the film's 135 minutes go by so fast it could only be explained by movie magic itself.Cary Grant is one of those actors that a filmgoer either falls in love with or deeply envies. His debonair manner is displayed to the full in this film, even though the peril that his character goes through would cause any normal dude to break into a maddening sweat.  The dialogue Roger Thornhill delivers alongside Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) in this film is sometimes too hilarious to be true, but wouldn't any woman fall for it? (I'm merely guessing here)  Ernest Lehman's screenplay is so lighthearted and yet very ominous. With all the traps and pitfalls Grant goes through in this film, you would have to find comedy in it. Grant does and to great appeal. I absolutely love the sequence at the auction when Roger tries to get himself arrested by yelling out flaky bids and accusing the auctioneer of selling junk worth no more than $8.  I also admire the scenes with Saint on the train to Chicago; I was tempted to jot down some of his pick-up lines, but then I realized it's just a movie (or is it?)Hitchcock was famous throughout his career of setting up death-defying sequences with major landmarks as backdrops. Here, Mount Rushmore will never be looked at the same again afterwards. We may never enter the United Nations again without peering behind our backs for a notorious knife-thrower. And, I dare say, I will never walk alongside a highway where a cropduster could swoop at any minute. I love the line during the Rushmore incident when Grant says his two ex-wives left him because he lived too dull a life. Go figure!It has been said that Hitchcock's many films each contain a personal side of the director inside them. The archetypes of the Master of Suspense are here amid the chasing and running across the U.S. The mysterious blonde, played to a tee by Eva Marie Saint, is a common fixture of many Hitchcock jaunts. Saint joins Grace Kelly and Tippi Hedren in this feature. The protagonist is again awkward when faced with  the opposite sex, but unusually casual when wrapped up in danger. The hero has an attachment to his mother, continually under his nurturing wing. And of course, the macguffin has fun with us again (government secrets my foot!)Whenever I see action-packed epics today like ""The Fugitive"" or the James Bond series, they all seem to quiver in comparison to this film. It amazes me that Hitchcock is able to hold the audience in the palm of his hand throughout the whole length of the journey. We become Grant as he runs away from the police and the secret agents who have chosen him as their dupe. But throughout the squabble, we sense that Grant is getting off on the whole jaunt, just as we want the chase to continue, not looking at our watches for a minute. However, it's fascinating to note that Roger Thornhill is not a born adventurer, nor is he an archeologist with a flair for escaping impossible situations. We are experiencing the Cary Grant in all of us, running away from an enemy we do not know they are or what they want. Is this symbolism of some kind? I say who cares; just watch the film and have fun!",North by Northwest
309,dave fitz,Classic Hitchcock,10,10 May 2000,"North by Northwest was the last of 4 films Alfred Hitchcock made with Cary Grant, the others being Suspicion, Notorious & To Catch A Thief. These two were a great team. Hitchcock's movies with Grant are among his best. This is a classic suspense film, exploring a popular Hitchcock theme: mistaken identity and a man struggling to prove his innocence. A very young Martin Landau plays a small supporting role, several years before he hit it big on ""Mission: Impossible"". Eva Marie Saint is sexy, although she doesn't compare to other Hitchcock actresses like Ingrid Bergman or Joan Fontaine. There are some classic moments here and the climactic scenes of this movie are among the most exciting I've ever seen.North by Northwest is one of the great suspense films of all-time and ranks with Vertigo and Rear Window among Hitchcock's very best films.",North by Northwest

Let me assure all you Hitchcock lovers that I also love Hitchcock. Some of my favorite thrillers are Psycho, Rear Window, and Family Plot. I realize you have to ""suspend your disbelief"" to a certain extent. But I found most of the story in North by Northwest absolutely unbelievable. Spoilers follow. I don't understand why the bad guys jumped to the conclusion that Cary Grant was the spy they were after, a spy they'd never even seen. I don't understand why Cary Grant didn't just start yelling and screaming as they abducted him in front of a big crowd of people. I don't understand why the bad guys decided to kill him, not by merely shooting him, but by bothering to force booze down his throat and putting him behind the wheel of a car, or how he was able to drive at all (rather than passing out). I don't understand why the police didn't find out whose house it was (the U.N. diplomat) and then wonder why anyone was there. I don't understand how the blonde knew which train Cary Grant would take, how she knew who he was (so she could pay someone to have him seated at her table in the club car), and why she helped him at all. I don't understand how a large crowd could witness a diplomat being stabbed by someone throwing a knife, then conclude that Cary Grant did it, or why Cary Grant (the ultimate stupidity) would pull the knife out of the diplomat's back and hold it up for everyone to see. Or why, once he was a hunted man, he did absolutely nothing to alter his physical appearance. I don't understand (skipping forward a bit to shorten my review) why the blonde sent Cary Grant to what should've been his certain death, and why, when he survived and saw her again, it didn't even bother him. I don't understand why the bad guys used such an absurdly contrived means of attempting to kill him again, having a crop duster fly at him, instead of (again) just shooting him. I don't understand why the crop duster pilot couldn't avoid flying his plane into a truck. I don't understand why the bad guys were hanging out in an open house that anyone could get into. And I don't understand how Cary Grant and the blonde (or anyone else) could possibly cling to the monuments with nothing but their bare hands and not fall to their deaths.

However, he felt in love with a very beautiful woman. At times it seems that he wanted to really escape, but also he was in love with her. Throughout the film, the chase of the plane was captured magnificently. A suspenseful film with also a great romantic touch to it. What was the ending? Did they really escape?

I won't spoil anything but he essentially gets thrown into an extremely dangerous situation where he is forced to save himself. His romantic interest played by Eve Saint Marie complicated things further. North by Northwest has some of the best cinematography of the time.

And then Townsend's eyes suddenly bulge... and - well, I won't spoil that scene just yet.I just wished that the fact that Thornhill was divorced by his ex's because of his living a dull life was foreshadowed more extensively. but I guess they couldn't have because as they say: START WHEN YOUR STORY STARTS. And I don't think it can count as a plothole or a flaw.You can see how Lehman crafts his story with care, precision and how he waits for that scene in the end where Eve reveals why she works for intelligence, and why she decided to cooperate. -- ""Has life always been like that?"" Very interesting to see Thornhill's character arc. Watch how he pretends to have forgotten about Eve in the hospital. Watch what he does when CIA old man steps out to get him his drink. There's also a quick, funny scene where the woman in glasses goes ""STOP...... I mean.... Stop."" I especially like Bernard Hermann's thrilling score. It has such an exhilarating, and sometimes hypnotic mood to it --- It's played in the beginning, in the scene where the intoxicated Roger tries to drive thru the hills, and in the movie's finale in Mt.

Added to that, i have never really been a Hitch man fan ! His stories for me are complicated intricate spiders web confusions.
Rebecca did hold my attention throughout and i dare say there are other Hitch offerings that are clever and worthwhile .
That said his thought processes and psychological forays invariably escape my narrative comprehension !
Intricate ( no doubt well constructed ) as I suppose they always are , land me in exasperating confusion mounted on more confusion ?
In my opinion THE BIRDS in its entirety was an unequivocal waste of my time , A truly one fact story which groaned on till a welcome
long awaited finale ! Even writing this review is a painful reminder of tiresome blah blah blah. Rear window was watchable and even
acceptable as an interesting and possible real life occurrence , great acting and cleverly executed . North by N W seemed to have so
many unanswered details, which the viewer can decide on for themselves ? After the crop scene, who informed him which hotel to
go to and was that a hick town or not, as judging from hotel lobby , furniture , decor etc. that was at least an expensive venue, which
on a sweltering hot night he still had his suit, shirt unruffled and tie in tact after what surely would have been a pretty long walk ?

322,Cue-ball,The Best of the Guilty Pleasures,10,13 December 2004,"Although I don't think this is Hitch's best film (IMHO that's ""Rear Window""), it's my favorite, partly because it features the Century Limited (which also has a featured role in ""The Sting"") and partly because the cast is so deep -- besides the top drawer stars (Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, and Martin Landau) it has great supporting character actors -- Leo G. Carroll, Jessie Royce Landis, Philip Ober, Edward Platt, Ed Binns, Les Tremayne, and the uncredited Malcolm Atterbury.The plot's merely a device to put together a string of unlikely set pieces involving Roger O. Thornhill (Grant), an advertising exec who is mistaken for a secret agent by two thugs, and taken off to meet the evil Jonathan Van Damme (Mason) masquerading as a UN Diplomat. The purpose of the charade is never explained; nor are Van Damme's contrived methods of offing Thornhill, none of which is successful. In a series of unlikely coincidences, Thornhill finds himself wanted for murder and fleeing from the police on the Century Limited, the train from New York to Chicago that saw thousands of passengers a day in its prime. Thornhill meets and seduces a beautiful young blonde on the train, who remarkably agrees to hide him from the authorities; mirabile dictu, she's Van Damme's girlfriend. But we don't care about the improbably confluence of events that drive the picture to its remarkable conclusion in South Dakota.The first among many excellent off-screen contributions is the Bernard Hermann soundtrack, whose frequent hemiolas paint an aural picture of the jagged angles suggested by the title and the opening credits set against the facade of the UN building.I agree with the many reviewers who put this movie at the top of their lists, and pity those who can't see the humor or suspense in this Hitch classic.

Just for an example, the crop dusting scene is suspenseful enough on DVD; the last time I watched it in a theater, people were ducking in their seats to get away from the plane.",North by Northwest

Fortunately, he comes to and tells this story to the police, who investigate but find that the facts Roger give them are no longer true.

The principals end up almost defacing a famous monument (somewhere near Rapid City) toward the end of this flick. Hitch's funny-bone is working well, as the very-drunk Cary tries to save his life while careening down a twisty mountain rode in a convertible...it's actually a very scary scene as Cary narrowly escapes injury and death several times, but it's also hilarious.

330,EdwardCarter,"Slow, dated and boring",1,30 September 2014,"Cary Grant, who lived with Randolph Scott for twelve years from 1932 to 1944, was far too old at 55 to be playing the romantic lead. It's hilarious that he looks the same age as the actress playing his mother - horrendously bad casting. This movie is a slow, overlong, dated and boring and it certainly cannot be compared to any of the Bond movies. In contrast to what some other reviewers here have claimed, Grant was never offered the Bond role, because he was far too old at 58. If this rubbish had been half an hour shorter, filmed on location instead of on fake-looking studio sets, and if it hadn't been so slow then maybe it would be watchable. William Holden would have been far better as Roger Thornhill.",North by Northwest

The brilliance with which Hitchcock develops the tension is the hallmark of the movie and it has so many quotable script lines and remarkable scenes. It just had an out-charming impact on me in 2012 which makes me wonder the kind of impact the movie would've created in 1959!!! The action scenes are as fantastic today as they ever were. The movie boasts some of the famous Hitchcock scenes, like the plane scene in the Indiana fields and the cliff-hanging ending scene on the Mt. Rushmore.Hitchcock definitely is the master of mysteries. He very well knows how many unanswered questions to have on the go at any one time, how many of them can the audience handle and when & how to answer them.

Only one instance listed below: Phillip Vandamm: Has anyone ever told you that you overplay your various roles rather severely, Mr. Kaplan? (hear Mason as Vandamm comment on Grant's ""acting school""etc...!)See Mason and Grant--observe their similar wardrobe and physical resemblance in their Mt. Rushmore restaurant...Mason played Shakespeare well-- see his Brutus in Mankewicz's great 1952 Julius Caesar. Yet he sometimes got roles Grant had rejected...the most famous being Norman Maine in the great ""A Star is Born"". I bet Hitch sensed this and encouraged Lehmann to hype up the actor rivalry in N by NW script.This real life ""competition"" only enhances the on screen N by NW movie.And the ""Slight to Chicago""? Here, the greatest movie crime N by NW commits! Chicago offers so many sinister possibilities and great visuals in its skyscrapers and shore line, etc, etc. But no! Only a quick train shot of Chicago in the daylight...all the stellar skyline is shot in the dark!

As far as this concept is concerned, this movie is no different from other Hitchcock's but what I like about this film is that it is also very funny which makes it an excellent 'comedy thriller'. Hitchcock had a very good sense of humor as well, which is very apparent in this film.Of course that crop duster sequence is marvelously shot and I loved that scene in the auction house and who can forget that famous climax at the Mt.

340,dlpburke,Failed My 30 Minute Test,1,1 November 2015,"This film is the latest to fail my 30 minute test. I give every film 30 minutes and, in that time, if the film has promise, I watch the remainder. The only films that fail the test are those that are very poor, for one reason or another.In the case of North by Northwest, the issue is blatantly clear: The script is ridiculously contrived, and the story is totally unbelievable. I cannot watch a serious film when it disregards reality in such a casual, off-hand manner. The premise of a man on the run because of mistaken identity is not too shabby, but there are so many insulting things the writer does to force the story. I'll give you one example, of many, in the first 30 minutes:Protagonist is abducted at gun point from a busy public building (already, that's absurd) by two men, who then take him elsewhere. He meets their boss, who tells him that he may as well drop the innocent act, and that his identity is known. After he unsuccessfully tries to convince the abductors that they have the wrong man, they force bourbon down his throat, and then attempt to crash him off a cliff, in an effort to make his death look like an accident. Even though the quantity of alcohol he has ingested would render him completely helpless, he somehow fights off one of the abductors and takes control of the car, managing to drive it for a long while before the police apprehend him. He is arrested and tells his story to the police and judge. So far, the writer wants us to believe that these professionals have:1. Abducted someone in this ridiculous fashion 2. Made a massive mistake with one of their targets 3. Been too stupid to realize after the protestations that the protagonist is not the man they are looking for 4. Have chosen a ridiculous method to kill their target. Seriously, if they were as organized as we're led to believe, the protagonist would just disappear. No professional would drive someone off a cliff.The level of realism is already rock bottom, and it only gets worse from this point on (sigh... for example, the protagonist decides to do his own investigation work, which involves entering the hotel room of the intended target, even though he has come close to being murdered. NO-ONE WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THIS. HUMANS DON'T BEHAVE THIS WAY.Everything that happens is totally unbelievable and against how real people think and operate. In order to make the film work, the writer has had to cheat by making everyone act like a moron. I absolutely guarantee you that if you take the initial incident and apply it to real life, it would end with the villains apologizing for mistaking you for someone else, your own death, or the villains being arrested. With a foundation that is SO rotten, nothing of worth can possibly grow.I love some of Hitchcock's films (especially Dial M For Murder, and Frenzy), but this is just absolute nonsense.",North by Northwest
341,jwayne_24,Another winner,10,31 July 2015,"Once again Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock team up to create a gem of a film, this time with Eva Marie Saint as leading lady. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, who is mistaken for another man and pursued by Philip VanDamme (James Mason) and his henchman, Leonard. Along the way, Thornhill is framed for murder and falls in love with a beautiful blonde Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), who may or may not be who she appears. Leo G. Carroll is excellent as the Professor, with his completely stone faced wit and dry sense of humor. The crop duster scene and the final showdown on Mount Rushmore are not only the highlights of the film, but two of the best action sequences of all time.

342,charlywiles,THE master director's master-work,10,7 February 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock was, in my opinion, the greatest director of all time and this is my favorite of all of his films. It's hard to argue against anyone who wants to claim either ""Vertigo,"" ""Rear Window,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Rebecca,"" ""Strangers on a Train"" or ""Foreign Correspondent"" as their favorite, but for sheer escapist entertainment, this film is hard to beat. It is the perfect example of the director's favorite plot - that of an innocent man wrongly accused who seems to dig himself into a deeper hole when he desperately tries to exonerate himself. The film has everything - mystery, suspense, adventure, international intrigue, romance and comedy.In their fourth film together, Cary Grant perfectly exemplifies why he was one of Hitchcock's favorite leading men. He is wonderful in the role and is at times funny (his drunken scenes and the scenes with his mother at the beginning of the film are as hilarious as any scenes in a screwball comedy), romantic (sparks fly in his scenes with Eva Marie Saint) and a man of action (this film, along with ""Notorious,"" To Catch a Thief"" and Stanley Donens's ""Charade"" demonstrate why he would've made a great James Bond).The supporting cast is wonderful, with Eva Marie Saint excellent and alluring as the femme fa-tale, if you will. Her sexual innuendo with Grant practically melts the celluloid. James Mason and Martin Landau make great villains, with Mason's smooth urbanity masking his devious nature. Leo G. Carroll (another of the director's favorites) is good as the officious government agent and Jessie Royce Landis is a howl as Grant's archly disapproving mother.Ernest Lehman's script is witty and clever with crackling dialogue and Bernard Herrmann's score is among his best. They both add so much to the excitement of the film. The art direction-set decoration is also exemplary, with a mock Mt. Rushmore set built inside the studio.Many scenes in the film are memorable, including Grant's drunken arrest, the killing at the United Nations, the iconic chase scene with the crop dusting plane in the cornfield (check out the brilliant editing here) and, of course, the literal cliffhanger atop Mt. Rushmore.It all adds up to being one of the director's most enjoyable and fun films. It's also amusing to try and figure out why Hitch considered this his most ""pornographic"" film. (hint - it has to do with the film's final scene).",North by Northwest
343,lowefreddy,"""Patience is a virtue."" ""So is breathing.""",10,15 May 2021,"Yeah, love it. What Hitchcock fan doesn't?North by Northwest is generally considered one of Hitchcock's more agreeable works across his fandom, and one understands why. James Bond fans will certainly love it (in fact you'll recognise one of its scenes that was later used in 'From Russia With Love'!). It defies symbolic or metaphorical interpretation and invites you to enjoy a whirlwind of off-the-wall adventure.(The title is, after all, ""north by northwest"". North by northwest does not exist. Rejection of realism is the point of this film. This film is supposed to be escapist entertainment, no deeper meanings required if you are not so inclined.)Cary Grant is hilarious as the baffled everyman caught up in a spy network. Eva Marie Saint does not disappoint either as the feisty, calculating, double agent sidekick. I love the scene where she has him hidden in the fold-up bed in the train compartment so the police don't find him:""Patience is a virtue.""
""So is breathing,"" Cary Grant's muffled voice murmurs from behind the wall.The final act is also entertaining as a high-adrenaline, soundtrack-heavy, final climax to your typical spy adventure. That obviously also pleases my inner 007 biases. Above all, Hitchcock's main USP is his ability to tell a satisfying story, and North by Northwest is one of the very best examples of that.I love it.

346,Danielpotato,Disappointment. But still a good movie to watch,7,19 November 2017,"When he went to Hollywood, Alfred Hitchcock made the movie Rebecca, which cost just over $ 1 million, and had a good box office run. Alfred Hitchcock just wanted to sell a ticket for the people to enjoy a good movie in a good section. After Rebecca, Mr. & Mrs. Smith also had success with the public, however it was with Strangers on a Train, Dial M for Murder, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Vertigo and obviously Rear Window that Hitchcock had its biggest hits in his Hollywood career until the mid-50's. With that Alfred Hitchcock gained a lot of strength within Hollywood, and he got a big budget for this movie, North by Northwest. North by Northwest was another commercial project that Alfred Hitchcock embraced in focus in the espionage. North by Northwest was successful at the box office, but it was not on the same wavelength as his previous projects, which I mentioned here, especially Rear Window, and the film did little more than double its own budget. So Alfred Hitchcock returned to Psycho on a more modest budget.North by Northwest, it's a good movie. It has a good suspense, the direction is very good by Alfred Hitchcock, and the performances are solid, especially Eva Marie Saint, who is perfect here. The great sin of this movie, for me, are the characters of this movie. Considering the important ideas and techniques that Alfred Hitchcock developed that could fill some books. I always expected more from this project. The problem with this film is how some of these characters were written, in this department I particularly blame Ernest Lehman. Ernest Lehman, wrote the characters in an amateur way, in which these same characters do not look anything like humans when confronted with the same situations that appear in the film. Particularly the scene with the mother of the main character, when she confronts one of the ""supposed"" hijackers in an elevator. From this moment, I completely lost the notion of a film with a serious focus. And to be honest, the characters surround the comedy tone many times and in many situations, particularly in some situations with the main character at a mid-train station. From that moment, I completely lost interest in this film, and I just went to look at the movie just to pass the time. And waiting for the movie to end. For a film that wanted to be serious, and this was its initial proposal with the public, the movie was loses much coherence as a film. It was a disappointment, for me.",North by Northwest

349,vinnieboards,"War is hell, Mr. Thornhill, even when it's a cold one....",10,12 October 2012,"The best 'mistaken identity' movie of them all, Hitchcock's masterpiece North By Northwest is a roller coaster ride from start to finish.Hitchcock originally wanted James Stewart to play Roger Thornhill and I'm convinced that with Hitchcock's direction we would have got much the same result. But Cary Grant is absolutely superb as the office exec who gets mistaken for George Caplan (who doesn't actually exist), and subsequently gets embroiled in a cold war plot where he has to fight to survive without having a clue what is happening around him.Grant plays his role with aplomb offering a mixture of anxiety, humour, sarcasm and disbelief. James Mason (Vandamme) is the man who wants Caplan dead and with his main henchman (an ice cold Martin Landau), they think they've achieved this by loading Thornhill up with Bourbon before getting him behind the wheel of a speeding car on a cliff top road. If only it were that easy. But Thornhill is a resilient man and after being framed for murder, looks to clear his name by discovering the truthNow Miss Kendall appears in the film, (Vandamme's mistress played by the excellent Eva Marie Saint) who leads you to believe that she has it in for Mr Thornhill but all is not what it seems.The plot twists and turns at relentless pace with a number of wonderful set pieces including crop dusting, Mount Rushmore and a hilarious confrontation in an auction room.But the crop dusting scene is the stand out moment and is where Hitchcock shows off his directorial genius. He makes great use of the landscape and the power of silence (intertwined with the odd car or bus noise) to leave you in no doubt that Thornhill is on his own. Then, in the distance, the faint, insignificant hum of a crop dusting plane emerges without giving the audience any realisation that this is actually the weapon Vandamme has chosen to rid him of his supposed adversary for good.Further twists include a fake shooting and the film culminates in the battle for survival on Mount Rushmore - epic stuff.North By Northwest is escapism at its very best and Grant plays the role in part for laughs which adds to the the movie's charm. His sarcastic sparring with Vandamme and Leonard, and his unashamed flirting with Eve all conspire to make a top notch thriller which you will want to watch again and again.It may not have the shocks as Psycho, the terror of the Birds, the taught tension and hopelessness of Rear Window. But as a thriller and piece of entertainment, this is one of Hitchcock's triumphs and gets a worthy 10 stars from me.",North by Northwest
350,jackhamel1987,The Thirty Nine Steps by any other name,10,30 August 2011,"North by Northwest set the standard for nearly all action/adventure films that followed its release in 1959. Raiders of the Lost Ark, Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and many other huge action films owe their existence to this exceptional piece of work. Even the well known 'British villain' can be accredited to this film. Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, Tim Roth, Gary Oldman etc all owe their careers to the wonderful James Mason in his role in this.North by Northwest is the big budget 'innocent man suspected of a crime he didn't commit' plot that Hitchcock was so fond of. And, in fairness, it's the best of those particular films.Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a marketing executive with two ex wives, a mother and a bartender relying on him. Then, one day, he's kidnapped by two men working for the mysterious Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Vandamme accuses Thornhill of being a spy, and threatens him with death unless Thorhill comes clean. Of course, Thornhill says he has no idea what Vandamm is talking about and he's almost killed. He escapes and starts to investigate his own kidnapping, only to then be accused of the murder of an important UN worker. He goes on the run as he attempts to clear his name, and as he does he meets a woman (Eva-Marie Saint), becomes embroiled in a CIA plot and is almost killed in two of the best action scenes of all time (the unforgettable crop dusting scene and the final climax on Mount Rushmore).This film sparkles because everything in it works perfectly. The script by Ernest Lehman is very sharp with some brilliant dialogue. The cast is perfect. The directing is, as with most Hitchcock films, breathtaking. The musical score by Bernard Herrman is, as always, perfect for the film and is now a classic.In terms of directing, this is Hitchcock at his best. In particular, the actions scenes are so well directed that there are very few films that haven't borrowed from this. Certainly the crop dusting scene is one of the best action scenes in history, and is iconic as the shower scene in Psycho. And the final scene at Mount Rushmore is a hugely worthy climax. The pace is nothing but breathtaking, and Hitchcock uses the camera cleverly to show us different emotions.The acting equal the directing in this. Cary Grant is wonderful as Roger Thornhill, the man on the run. Eva-Marie Saint is elegant in her role as the woman being used. And Leo G.Carrol is gives a solid performance as the CIA boss who uses many people to get his way.But, as with any film, there is a stand out performance. In this film, that performance is given by James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, the villain. Mason absolutely purrs through this movie, never raises his voice, is always in control of everything he does and his people do. He set the standard for all villains in film, and in particular gave birth to the 'British villain' that we have all become so used to.There are two points that hold this film back from being perfect. The first is that I think sometimes the motives of other characters are not explored deeply enough. Certainly Eva-Marie Saint's character is never entirely explained. And in some ways, Vandamm's motives are unexplained too. You don't notice this right until the end, where after the Rushmore sequence, the film ends a little too abruptly.The second point is that this film isn't original, yet claims to be. This film is in fact a very clever adaption of John Buchnan's The Thirty Nine Steps. Read the book, see a few of the other adaptions, and you'll realize that this film is The Thiry Nine steps in all but name. And because it gives no credit to that original plot, I can't say that it's perfect.But, overall, those two points won't detract too much from what is a fast paced ride across America, with some exceptional action sequences along the way.",North by Northwest
351,Oceans17,Ultraperfect synthesis of romantic comedy and metaphysical thriller,10,15 July 2007,"Until the 50s millions of elegant romantic comedies were produced, with tons of wit that screenplays seem to lack ever since. Since the 60s, millions of action thrillers have been produced, with tons of high octane fuel we can even get tired of. And in between, namely in 1959, Hitchcock placed the more than perfect merging of the two genres.The ultimate blueprint for lighthearted adventure, with subtle metaphysical overtones such as identity without existence, overlapping layers of lie, truth and ambiguity, and not only one but two consecutive enigmatic endings, one in a stylish house (with a climax where the hero is mostly off screen, while we hear gunshots that are not even real fire, as we know later in a quite humorous way) and the other with the backdrop of the presidents' giant faces, epitomizing the whole film: a meaningless pursuit under cold, great powers that largely surpass the characters.But even against this stone-cold backdrop there is place for a real cliffhanger and some romance, concluding with a funny visual metaphor... Summing up, Hitchcock at his best. I prefer this playful Hitchcock over the solemn (""Vertigo"", ""Torn curtain"") or scary one (""Psycho"", ""The Birds"") although his films always have an humorous undercurrent, again lacking in most contemporary films, that provides a necessary distance between both sides of the screen: too many films today pretend to be serious and real (in a shallow sense, of course).A 200% perfect film, with an unforgettable Cary Grant and the beautiful Eva Marie Saint, top class villains James Mason and Martin Landau, elegant title sequence and extraordinarily thrilling music by Bernard Herrmann.10 out of 10.

352,ecarle,The Midpoint Movie,10,13 November 2003,"The great ""North by Northwest"" comes at the mid-point of entertainment film history.  When Alfred Hitchcock made it in 1959, it was the culmination of thrillers he had made:  30's British spy chase thrillers like ""The 39 Steps"" and 40's American World War II spy chase thrillers like ""Saboteur"" and ""Foreign Correspondent.""   ""North by Northwest"" was Hitchcock's greatest chase, part self-homage, part self-parody.All those chase movies came BEFORE ""North by Northwest,"" and then this midpoint movie influenced every action thriller that came AFTER it: ""North by Northwest"" led to James Bond which led to Indiana Jones which led to ""The Matrix.""  But besides being historic, ""North by Northwest"" is as good as a classic gets:   three classic action set-pieces (the car, the crop-duster, Mount Rushmore), some of the wittiest dialogue in the history of movies;  Cary Grant at his best, James Mason at his best, Eva Marie Saint at her best. Spectacular modern fifties credit sequence by Saul Bass with Bernard Herrmann's exciting score (launched by the MGM lion's roar.) 
It's not ""The Matrix,"" but take a time machine back to 1959 and enjoy the most influential chase thriller of all time.And remember Cary Grant, as Roger Thornhill, delivering this great line:  "" I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex-wives, and several bartenders waiting for me, and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed.""",North by Northwest

The best thing about the film is its screenplay. It is very exciting and full of twists. I felt surprise at every moment just like Cary Grant's character. Romantic sub-plot isn't as striking as Hitchcock's other films but everything is overshadowed by its engaging story. It is kind of thriller you can watch with ease, it keeps entertaining you. About the cast Cary Grant was quite convincing and so was James Mason. But I really loved Eva Marie Saint. I'm a big fan of her and this time also she stunned me with her fantastic performance.

Carroll(He was in every Hitch movie it seemed), and Martin Landau(in his first film role--he was brilliant as Leonard).  I love the way Cary Grant says things in such a deadpan way like when he says early in the movie, ""Don't tell me where we going, surprise me!""  Although long, you will not be bored for a single second.  It is really hard for me to believe that Ben-Hur was that great. This movie should have won several oscars.

One curious note is that Jessie Royce Landis, who also appeared with Grant in To Catch a Thief, plays Grant's mother although Grant is 10 months older than her! Also, make sure you pay attention to the kid in the cafeteria who sticks his fingers in his ears a tad too early!  It is a shame that when people mention Hitchcock's name, they think of the horror stuff like Psycho or The Birds or they think of the taut thrillers like Vertigo or Rear Window.  Not that there is anything wrong with these movies, it is just that nobody thinks he can direct such a non-stop action picture like this.  It may have been the most atypical Hitch movie ever in terms of style, but I feel it is his greatest ever.  If you have never seen this movie, you got to go see it now--you'll be glad that you did.  I'll leave with another one of my favorite lines in the movie that Cary Grant says to Eva Marie Saint, ""How does a girl like you become a girl like you?""  WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!",North by Northwest
358,nofear1012001,Perfection,10,31 October 2002,"This movie is perfect. I would almost like to leave it at that- a one sentence review but that wouldn't seem right. So I will just make some brief comments. Hitchcock outdoes himself on this film, Eva Marie Saint is absolutely gorgeous, Cary Grant is spectacular in this film and I don't think I have ever seen a better movie. This is a movie about Russian spies and American spies but BELIEVE me, you don't have to have a clue about spies to enjoy this movie. This is also Hitchcock's longest film (2 hours 20 minutes) but this moves so fast, you won't even notice. In fact, thats one of the greatest things about this movie is how fast it moves- there are no dull parts here. Nothing more to say- buy this NOW!",North by Northwest
359,ChristophCinema,A fun film for everyone,10,26 October 2012,"When I was a kid, I was a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan. Even though most of his films were complex and I didn't understand a lot of the big words the actors were using, I just always loved watching them. As a child, I wasn't into older movies. I loved the classic Disney movies, I loved the Universal monster movies, but anything else, I didn't care for. It wasn't until I was about 12 that I began getting into all the classics. This is when my obsession with Hitchcock films began, and continued for years to come. It's hard to pick a favorite film of his because he's made so many classics, but I'm going to ultimately say that North by Northwest is my favorite. Why? Well there are many reasons. First of all the characters are just classic Hitchcock. When I was a kid, I really looked up to Cary Grant's character. I love how he comes off as so smooth, yet so over his head. It's been said that Grant's performance had a great influence on the character, James Bond, and I'm not surprised. Cary Grant just steals the show here. Just the way he talks, and the way he handles things, you believe that something like this would happen to him. The villains are kind of cliché, but that's what makes them so great. And of course, there's Eva Marie Saint as the beautiful female lead. Hitchcock's female characters were always awesome, because on the surface, they just seemed like a pretty face, but as the films unravel, we find out there's a lot more to them. You never know what to expect with these women, and that's what makes them so addicting. The last thing I must mention about this movie is how big it is. Every Hitchcock film has a certain look to it. They're all visually appealing (which is one of the reasons I liked them so much as a kid). Vertigo has a surreal, dream like world. Rear Window has an enclosed, claustrophobic world. North by Northwest just has this grand scope. From the city, to the fields in the middle of nowhere, to Mount Rushmore, this film just has a grand look to it, and goes perfectly with its grand story. Like I said, North by Northwest is just a fun movie. With its great characters, great story, great comedy, great suspense, and great visuals, it feels just like a comic book. I think this is a movie that anyone can get into. If you've never seen a Hitchcock film, North by Northwest is a good place to start (it's what got me into Hitchcock). And one last thing; this movie has my favorite Hitchcock cameo. That is all.",North by Northwest
360,RossLikesMovies,Nothing special,4,15 June 2005,"In the good old days of movie making,the fifties and sixties, thrillers and horror were reliant on suspense and incinuations rather than the gore and hide from the killer type formula of today. This is, what the 'master of suspense', Alfred Hitchcock did so well. Not so with this film I'm afraid.Cary Grant is the leading man who is mistaken for somebody else. Causing some crooks to pursue him for, err a while. Grants love interest comes in the form of Eva Marie Saint. A rather implausible and predictable twist rears its head. If you think about it, you can probably guess it without even having seen the movie.Talking of suspense this just lack suspense. Compared to hitchcock movies such as vertigo. The bad guys just aren't threatening. They're just like cartoon monsters, they chase but they don't kill. This being pg entertainment and for the films time its understandable. Though bad guys shouldn't have been drawn in this way anyway. Surely Hitch realised that? I think that the films main downfall is that the bad guys are shown to much. Early on we know they're not threatening pursuers. Theirs no suspense damn it! The thing Hitchcock does so well in other films is disguising the miscreants, rather than showing them so much, which leaves little room for incinuations and the classic who done it question. Also the fear of what we the viewer do not know.The fact also remains that Cary Grant isn't that good an actor. He may have been good for romantic roles but here he feels out of place. Sure, he has some good lines, Which inject humour into his character, but unlike hitchcock regular James Stewart he can't do serious that well. He just comes across as bumbling, stupid and unable to solve the films final resolution. Making things more implausible.To conclude I'm surprised that the film is so highly acclaimed, as it really isn't a patch on the likes of psycho, vertigo or rear window.",North by Northwest
361,Aldri7,fun to see again,8,28 August 2006,"The greatness of North by Northwest may be measured in part by its imitators. Two of my favorite movies, both made since 1959, are ""Silver Streak"" and ""The Sting"". Both were very popular movies that borrowed heavily from it. It is easy to look back now, see the scenes with Cary Grant on the train, and say "" I've seen this before"". Sure, in ""Silver Streak"", which had Gene Wilder and Jill Clayburgh trading sexual innuendos across the dinner table (""I give great phone"" was one line) just as Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint did. Or to watch the climactic gun battle between Robert Redford and Paul Newman in ""The Sting"" and have the same reaction. Both of these movies, made in the 70's, were big hits, but how many people knew that Hitchcock deserved half the credit? As I watched this movie again (hadn't seen it for a long time), I was also struck by Martin Landau's understated but captivating performance. Based on his work in this film, he would have been just right for the part of Mr Spock in Star Trek, a role that Gene Rodenberry wanted him to take. Cool and emotionless playing next to James Mason, one can definitely see the Spock in him.",North by Northwest
362,shafatqadri,One of the best of Hitchcock,8,23 January 2008,"The 1950s was a mixture of successes and failures for Alfred Hitchcock. Most of his successes are classic thriller films such as Rear Window, Vertigo and Strangers on a Train. Hitchcock did have some failures such as I Confess and To Catch a Thief, but I think by the end of the 1950s, his successes definitely outweigh his weaker pictures and he finished off this decade with the critically and commercially acclaimed thriller, North by Northwest.North by Northwest follows Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a 'Madison Avenue', advertising man from New York, whose life is turned upside-down when he is mistaken as a government spy by the name of George Kaplan. He is mistaken for being a spy by a man named Lester Townsend (James Mason), who also seems to be a spy and is paranoid that this so called Kaplan figure has secrets about Townsend's organization. Along with his bunch of thugs, who are led by Leonard (Martin Landau), they attempt to turn Thornhill's life upside-down.Now a man on the run, Thornhill runs off to Chicago to find the real George Kaplan, who he thinks knows what is going on. However, Thornhill realizes that even when he is on the train, he is being chased. However, a beautiful blonde named Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is willing to protect him. However, is Thornhill safe with Kendall? Just watch the movie.Like all Hitchcock films, there are hundreds of things that aren't realistic though set in the real world and lots of highly improbable stuff going on everywhere, but if you give it a chance you'll enjoy it and won't care. North By Northwest keeps the winning streak going, and enjoys a well cemented stay in IMDb's Top 50",North by Northwest
363,cmantafounis,North by Northwest,8,22 September 2021,"Pure movie magic: Hitchcock at his pulpiest, an exercise in sheer entertainment. Comparisons to James Bond here are not just pertinent in regards to the genre and characters, but all the more so in style - this exists on the same plane as Raiders of the Lost Ark in its elevation from any semblance of reality. On this level, Thornhill being forced to drink a bottle of bourbon and then to drive a stolen vehicle is not out of the ordinary. A plan to kill him involving a deserted road and a crop duster is perfectly logical. His dialogue with Eve Kendall, mostly consisting of explicit innuendo, is completely natural in this heightened world exclusive to films. Led by a charming Cary Grant performance, an ecstatic Bernard Hermann score, and plenty of Alfred Hitchcock's visual flair, North by Northwest is designed solely as a moviegoing experience. At 136 minutes, this lacks the sleekness of his earlier spy capers (e.g. The 39 Steps) but more than makes up for it in craft. Any pacing issues in the second act - and occasional instances of clunky exposition - are paid back tenfold with a dazzling final half-hour. A suffocating masterwork of suspense in Vandamm's house (note the ""fake gun"" reveal used here, successfully, *three* times), an iconic chase scene down Mount Rushmore, and a sudden cut so perfectly suited to the tone that one smiles just thinking of it. And, of course, that marvellous final shot. A climax indeed. This may not be as artful or as flawlessly executed as some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, but I'll be damned if it isn't his most fun.",North by Northwest

This is as suspenseful as it was then as it is now, and those who don't appreciate that don't deserve to either.James Mason steals the show as the class act villain of the piece, and Cary Grant plays his part to perfection as the high powered businessman who gets mistaken for someone else, and suddenly all the baddies are out to get him.You will have many chances to view this film, as it is on the TV regularly, you can find it at any decent rental shop, and there has also been a well deserved DVD release as well, so you can't make any excuses for not seeing it.Honestly, this is one of Hitchcock's best films, so you'd be stupid to miss it!",North by Northwest

This movie doesn't bore for a second and keeps on going with one classic bit after another. The acting is outstanding, there is great humor in the script, the locations are unique, and the special effects are seemless. Cary Grant is at his absolute peak in this one and I would highly recommend it. As a side note, in the past year I've seen three Hitchcock films on the big screen (Rear Window and Vertigo, recently restored) and they've all been great. Hitchcock's work is so visual, it's great on a big screen and of course his soundtracks are worth a theater as well.",North by Northwest
366,barrwell,"its an action movie, a road picture, a romance with espionage thrown in...this is a movie with universal appeal",10,15 December 2010,"Alfred Hitchcock has certainly made scarier movies (Psycho, The Birds), and he's made more suspenseful movies (Notorious, Shadow of a doubt), but I don't think he ever made a movie that was as purely entertaining as North by Northwest. What I mean by universal appeal is this; you could put anyone (who likes movies) of any age and sit them down in front of North by Northwest and they will likely enjoy themselves. This movie has something for everyone, it has excellent pacing and sceneryand of course it has the old master at the helm.North by Northwest certainly doesn't look like it's over 50 years old. That's something that a master like Hitchcock adds to a film; his expert use of lighting, camera positioning and sound give this movie a crispness that defies its age. This adds to that universal appeal I mentioned, alas many movies from the 1950s don't look near as good as North by Northwest. It amazes me how many recent movies have forced me to abort due to inferior camera techniquesexcessive camera movement (this can actually make me dizzy), too many close-ups and weird angles, and poor lighting and editing. Heres the deal; many of todays film directors have NO CLUE how to make a truly watchable and lasting movie...and the bigger problem...most of the dumbed-down audience of today can't tell the difference.Speaking of masters, does any actor today really carry a movie with such grace as Cary Grant? Grant plays Richard Thornhill in this movie, a wall street exec who has been mistaken for someone else by a group of international Art collectors who are also into espionage (what secrets they are transporting is irrelevantwhat Hitchcock called the 'Mcguffin'). Grant moves through the film with his typical easy charm that maybe today's young actors should study, indeed Cary Grant is a natural and this is a perfect role for his style. Thornhill is befriended by the lovely Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint, also well cast) on the 20th century limited, but Kendall may or may not be what she appears to be.The story takes us to Chicago where Thornhill is supposed to meet a man at a dusty crossroads in the middle of corn country as (in case you don't know) one of the most famous scenes in movie history unfolds. Eventually we end up at the Mount Rushmore memorial for one of Hitchcock's patented climaxes in or around some famous, exotic locale.It's a wonderful ride... I think the best test of a classic movie is the test of time. I first saw (and fell in love with) North by Northwest in a hotel room in Utah while on vacation when I was about 15 years old. I've watched it many times since and it always seems fresh. When a master is on the mark it is something to relish a gift from the movie gods.Hitchcock was once asked what he did for a living to which he replied ""producer"", when asked what he produced he answered ""Goosebumps"". Enjoy the ride!update: -3 thumbs-down and no 'likes'? KISS MY ASS...I'm not wasting my time anymore doing this, the American movie watching (and internet surfing) public of today are a bunch of frkin morons anyway and the only film they know is what is on their teeth",North by Northwest
367,Percivalx,Hitchcock's thrilling game of cat-and-mouse!,10,13 November 2005,"Exhilaration, anxiety, and tension all describe North by Northwest, Hitchcock's masterpiece about mistaken identity. Manhattan advertising executive Roger Thornhill is kidnapped by a gang of spies led by debonair Phillip Vandamm. Vandamm believes Thornhill is George Kaplan, a CIA agent supposedly working to stop him from exporting a valuable statue full of top-secret microfilm. After his first attempt at murdering Thornhill (or Kaplan) fails, Thorhnill is chased across the Midwest in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse. What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. The action unfolds seamlessly, no scene is wasted, and even has comedic touches. This is in partly due to Ernest Lehman's rich screenplay. He wrote other films full of great dialogue ( Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf, Sweet Smell of Success) but in North by Northwest, he is at his peak. The dialogue between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint at the train dinner table, for example, is full of awesome sexual innuendo. The Master of Suspense uses his mastery of direction by creating yet another suspenseful story full of excitement and mystery. The luscious photography and tension-building musical score are attributed to the masterminds of Robert Burks and Bernard Herrmann, respectively. Be on the look out for many unforgettable scenes--the auction scene, the crop duster scene, the Mt. Rushmore sequence and many more in between. Highly Recommended!",North by Northwest
368,Fpi,"Excellent, although slightly dated",8,9 February 2007,"An unpredictable plot such as this will never look dated, but the stiff acting, some of the humour and the written-style dialogue has a certain flavour of the 1950s. Also, I thought some of the characters behaved rather unrealistically, but all this is easy to forgive when the movie is so much fun overall. The visuals are great, and the intriguing plot is beautifully unveiled by master director Hitchcock.I'm slightly surprised that this at the time of writing is considered amongst the top 25 movies ever. I can easily pick 25 movies I like even more - still, there's no denying that this is an exciting and very entertaining movie that everyone should see!",North by Northwest

And after half a century, ""North By Northwest"" holds up beautifully. This film has it all: suspense, glamour, humor, and images that capture the imagination and remain etched in memory. The legendary crop-dusting sequence alone is a master class in the art of pure cinema. Like the rest of the film, it's brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed. All the elements come together to produce the finest form of entertainment. Bernard Herrmann's frantic fandango captures the complexity and pace of the action. Ernest Lehman's script is full of sophisticated dialogue. Performances are spot on. Has Cary Grant ever been more engaging? Is James Mason the ultimate in charming villains?

370,JoshuaHarryMurphy,Very Good,8,12 June 2014,"In Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 spy thriller film ""North by Northwest"", Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill – a quick-witted advertising executive who is thrust into the world of spies, deception and murder as he is mistaken for a man named George Kaplin and is framed for murder. On the run from the police, Thornhill meets beautiful blonde Eve Kendell (Eva Marie Saint), who aids in Thornhill's misadventures across America, concluding in a spectacularly constructed action set piece set atop Mt. Rushmore in South Dakota. A change of tone and pace in comparison to his previous film, the dark psychological thriller ""Vertigo"", Hitchcock masterfully blends elements from the action, comedy and thriller genres here to create something seemingly familiar, but with enough bite to give its own sense of uniqueness and personality. An intrinsic factor for this film's grip on its audience undeniably from Ernest Lehman's charming and imaginative Academy Award nominated original screenplay, which effortlessly breathes life into characters through the use of unanticipated humour and genuine sincerity which allows the relationship between Grant and Saint's characters to bloom. Both leading actors are stunning, and the supporting cast are as equally adept, with James Mason stealing the show with a subtle and classy performance as Phillip Vandamm, the film's antagonist. Coinciding with the cast is the instantly memorable soundtrack by Hitchcock's frequent collaborator Bernard Hermann, who crafts the audio so precisely and in such a measured manner that within many sequences the soundtrack seemingly transforms into an individual of its own, having direct interaction with the characters. The most emphatic aspect of this film however; is its direction. Gloriously imagined by Hitchcock, every shot provides masses of magnificent imagery to indulge the audience, especially within 'the crop-duster sequence', which is perhaps one of the most challenging, inventive and yet wonderfully simplistic shots ever filmed. Perhaps the greatest testament to this film is how its imagery, performances and soundtrack have been etched within millions of people for generations, and fifty four years after its release, its legacy is showing little sign of coming to a close. The film may not be Hitchcock's most recognised piece, but it's truly a masterpiece.",North by Northwest

Needless to say, expectations were high. How could this film possibly compare to ""The Birds"", ""Marnie"", ""Notorious"", or ""Rear Window""?? I am happy to say that my expectations were not only met, they were surpassed. This is another GREAT Hitchcock film. Cary Grant's talent is especially showcased here. His dry wit and delivery of his (well-written) lines made me literally laugh out loud in places. I am becoming convinced that Hitchcock is the modern equivalent of Shakespeare- that his work is perpetually as timely and appealing as it was at the time it was produced.

372,jasonsurety,More Hits than Misses,8,3 May 2004,"North by Northwest is a highly touted Alfred Hitchcock film.  Ranked among his classics such as Vertigo, Rear Window, and Notorious, N.b.N. is generally thought of as one of the suspense master's all-time greats.  It is an overall appealing film but is not on the same level as the aforementioned flicks.  There are terrific moments, but the film doesn't come together as well as these other Hitchcock thrillers.  The ending is not quite up to par, either. The movie deals with Roger Thornhill(Cary Grant) as a cool, witty advertising executive in Manhattan.  He is wrongly identified as an agent for the government by a crime organization.  He is setup and narrowly escapes his first brush with danger.  The police do not believe his story, and everyone, including Thornhill's own mother, thinks he is out of his mind.  From here, Grant goes on a wild ride to clear his name and find out what the hell is going on.
This ride involves planes, trains and automobiles and he meets up with Eve Kendall(Eva Marie Saint) who is very forward with him, and we can tell right away that she's up to something.  Their conversation reminded me of a conversation Frank Sinatra has with Janet Leigh in The Manchurian Candidate. Unlike the latter, which can be seen as having several different meanings and subliminal messages, Grant and Saint have chemistry in their teasing, but it stays rather one dimensional and more formulaic.Scenes like the one where Grant intentionally gets arrested at an auction to escape a couple henchmen are comical and clever.  Even now with computers and high-tech special affect the cropduster and Mt. Rushmore scenes are exhilarating, to say the least.  The cinematography is wonderful throughout the picture, and except for the 50's automobiles and attire, looks remarkably fresh and modern.
While Vertigo's ending was one of the most shocking, Rear Window's the most suspenseful, and Notorious' perfectly fitting, N.b.N.'s didn't thrill me quite the same.  Perhaps I am being overly critical because of my expectations.  The three Hitchcock movies I've compared to North by Northwest are all 10's in my book, while this one gets an 8.

But my goodness will you enjoy the time your butt is in your seat watching this film.If Hitchcock can be used as an adjective I'd describe North by Northwest as one of the most Hitchcocky films he made. The imagination and talent behind each shot is suburb. This movie was shot during the wild west of movie making and Hitchcock used the camera in many outstanding and creative ways during this film.Cary Grant, my goodness, I couldn't tell if I was watching acting or if that was just him. Grant truly embodied his character and had fun with it, pulling the audience further into the compelling plot.Talking about the plot, this movie tells a story where if I was to describe any bit of it, it would spoil everything. So I'll just say that it felt fresh, new, and exciting. Even 60 years after this movie was released.Now my beef. The female protagonist isn't introduced until almost an hour into the movie. It felt as if this film had been holding in all the romantic commentary and substance-less conversation and just exploded as soon as the female character was introduced. Though a lot of it plays into the plot, boy was much unnecessary and dragged on for an eternity. Adding to the already too long run time of 136 minutes.Overall, a fantastic movie that keeps you quite engaged throughout the run-time.

Actually suggesting a sexual relation in her first sentences to our hero, played by Cary Grant. In the year of 1959 I am certain that this was not something one did every now and then, as it is not even yet practised in our own time.

Cary Grant is very funny as Thornhill (the once mooted Jimmy Stewart would've been a more interesting choice though), while James Mason's slimy villain is memorable without resorting to gimmickry.

Like most Hitchcock films, this one is loaded with suspense and is credited as one of his best plots. It starts out seeming like a typical man wrongly accused where you think you're going to have to wait until the end for him to prove his innocence. Then the story takes multiple twists and turns including weaving in a love story that has its own unexpected surprises.

This movie demonstrates a lot of camera angles including close ups, establishing shots, tracking shots, over the shoulder shots, high shot, and many others. The action portrayed in this movie is amazing and the editors did a great job with what they had to work with. The scene that sticks out to me most is obviously the scene where they're on Rushmore and the men start rolling down the mountain slowly mid fight, the music starts to pick up loud and cause a dramatic feeling as you witness a near death fight. Where finally one of the men throw the other clean off the mountain. The effect of the mountain and backgrounds look amazing fir a film this old and showcase the great editing skills on the people behind this film. The movie uses many different lighting effects with the mountain scene being dark with a singular light source being the moon which is well done. The music in the background of this movie goes a long way and really strengthens the emotions of the viewers while watching this.

The dramatic music by Bernard Herrmann greatly added to my overall enjoyment of the film.  This is a fast moving witty thriller in magnificent Technicolor with Cary Grant as Roger O. Thornhill giving the performance of a lifetime. Grant is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan and is thrust into one life threatening situation after another on the run from both the police and the bad guys!

There are some spectacular set pieces in unusual locations such as the United Nations Building, New York's Grand Central Station, Mount Rushmore and who can forget the famous crop dusting sequence at Prairie Stop on deserted Highway 41.  Cary Grant wears the same suit throughout the film but stil manages to look as elegant as ever despite the many tricky and dangerous situations he finds himself in!  James Mason has never been better as the sinister Phillip Vandamm intent on eliminating Cary with the help of his two menacing associates Adam Williams and Robert Ellestein who played their villainous parts very convincingly. Eva Marie Saint was the usual Hitchcock ice cool blonde heroine while Jessie Royce Landis was excellent as Cary Grant's mother although in reality she was only a few months older than Grant! (They were both born in 1904). This actress was also with Cary Grant in another Hitchcock film ""to Catch a Thief"" in which she played Grace Kelly's mother. Martin Landau was impressive in his first screen role as the vicious Leonard trying to get rid of Cary at every opportunity! Veteran actor Leo G. Carroll was making his sixth appearance in a Hitchcock film as the CIA/FBI Agent known only as the ""Professor"". One of my favourite actresses Doreen Lang had the small part of Grant's secretary Maggie and can also be seen in other Hitchcock films such as ""The Wrong Man"" and ""The Birds"". Surprisingly, ""North by Northwest"" did not win any Oscars and Hitchcock, Cary Grant and the film itself were not even nominated which in retrospect was a regrettable oversight. It was unfortunate that this was the year when ""Ben Hur"" scooped the awards and won an amazing total of 11 Oscars. The films nominated for Best Picture that year were ""Ben Hur"" (the winner), ""Anatomy of a Murder"", ""Diary of Anne Frank"", ""The Nun's Story"" and ""Room at the Top"".  Looking at these titles today it is unbelievable to me that ""North by Northwest"" could not have been included in the nominations.  The best actor Oscar went to Charlton Heston for ""Ben Hur"" and the other nominees were Laurence Harvey (""Room at the Top""), Jack Lemmon (""Some Like It Hot""), Paul Muni (""The Last Angry Man""), and James Stewart (""Anatomy of a Murder""). Ernest Lehman's Oscar nominated story and screenplay was full of gems including Jessie Royce Landis asking the would-be assassins: ""You gentlemen aren't really trying to kill my son are you?"". And Grant to Leo G. Carroll: ""I'm an advertising man, not a red herring! I've got a job, a secretary, a mother, two ex wives and several bartenders dependent upon me and I don't intend to disappoint them all by getting myself slightly killed!"".  A Hitchcock masterpiece. 10/10.  Not to be missed. Clive Roberts.",North by Northwest
384,TabithaNoel,A Very Good Classic Film,8,15 April 2021,"This film is another great film by Alfred Hitchcock. The acting is good, cinematography is good, and the costumes are good. I like how when they're climbing down Mount Rushmore how the camera is filming not straight but kind of at an angle. I think the color looked nice and the picture in general; it looked crisp and clean. The outfits are nice; one thing I have learned is Alfred Hitchcock and Eva Marie Saint went shopping for her characters clothing to make it more authentic and more of the actress's style. I thought the acting was good; at some point in the film when Eva Marie Saint's character is in danger or is feeling guilty, you can see that feeling in her face and eyes even if she's not talking. I give this film an 8 out of 10 for being a classic and how well everything was put together.",North by Northwest

After being told my whole life that this was a really good movie and it was so good and so on and so forth, it was a real disappointment. I would hardly call it a suspense movie, but maybe it was never supposed to be suspense. There is a lot more romance and talking than chasing bad guys. Like most films, however, its not without it's good points. Cary Grant is , as usual, quite dashing in the lead role, even though he is obviously aging by this point in time. It was fun to watch the crop duster sequence and Mount Rushmore scenes, which were every bit as exciting as I had hoped.So while this movie is not quite what I would call Hitchcock class, it is quite satisfactory as a Friday night Fun Flick, or to watch with older kids.",North by Northwest
386,Gov_William_J_LePetomane,"Frankly, my dear, it's disappointing",6,12 April 2019,"What I liked: The acting was good. Some of the dialogue was good. The Mt. Rushmore shots were fun, by and large, and the final shot of the train barreling into a tunnel is just too hilariously suggestive not to like. What I didn't like: well, there sure are a lot of far-fetched a-goin's on, aren't there? Thornhill does precious little objecting in regards to his kidnapping. And attempting to get rid of Kaplan by pouring bourbon down his gullet and crashing a car? That's the best they can do? And Vandamm and company simply commandeer the Townsend manse? Is it that easy to do, to just waltz into the home of UN diplomat and take it over? Thornhill gets on the train to Chicago without a ticket too easily. And why not just do a drive-by while Thornhill is waiting in that Indiana cornfield? Killing him from a plane is easier than that? And the final sequence of switching from the scene with Eve dangling from Mt. Rushmore, to Thornhill pulling Eve up into bed - at first I thought it was awfully hokey. But I can also see another side to it: Hitchcock perhaps snubbing his nose at the usual damsel in distress being saved finale that everyone was expecting. Oh, and the laughter of everyone in that elevator to the line ""You aren't really trying to kill my son, are you?"" was bizarre and nonsensical.",North by Northwest

At the time, Hitchcock's films, while great, were beginning to be considered a little stale and repetitive. That is, until ""North by Northwest"" (1959). In this film, many different genres come together to create a film that goes down as one of the all time classics.

Hitchcock incorporated comedy, action, and romance, with a heavy dose of action. He transfers between scenes very smoothly, and he seems to cut at just the right moment. The cinematography uses lots of zooming shoots, that come into focus on one thing. One of my favorite shots of he film was when the main character was walking through a packed train station. Even though there were tons of other people, the camera seemed to track the main character perfectly so you stayed focused on him.

391,falconer99,Why not Hitchcock's best?,10,13 August 2005,"To summarise, let's just say this is over two hours long and yet seems to last only minutes. You just wish it were longer.And all the clichés in it were there for the first time: we've just seen them so many times since. I think it was in his conversations with Truffaut that Hitchcock said that, when a character is on the run in a film, he is always shown as walking down rain-washed cobbled streets, hiding in the night, but Hitchcock wanted to change all that and make it as light as possible, hence the crop-duster scene ... as every director has done ever since.Back-projection has never been that good in Hitchcock's films, I'm sorry to say. I think that film-goers were just expected to accept it at the time. But I think the special effects in the finale (now where was it set?) are superb, and I really feel that the actors and stand-ins are really there (I was surprised it wasn't actually filmed there) ... apart from the studio inserts, that is.But the plot is entirely original (or so I believe, but you always find something in the archives ...); Lehman's lines are very witty (and sexy!); the casting is superb (Grant never turned in a bad performance, and Landau, Mason and, especially, Carroll, setting himself up for his long-term role in his later acting career, are outstanding); and, like all Hitchcock's films, it's a fine comedy (and Psycho is the biggest joke of all). So why do all the critics always favour Vertigo, Rear Window, Strangers on a Train, The Trouble with Harry or Psycho? Well, North by Northwest is my favourite Hitchcock anyway.And I'm sure I don't have to mention Herrmann's massive contribution.In fact, my only objection is James Mason's cardigan.

393,james-t-sheridan,Cary Grant: The Original Running Man,10,20 July 2012,"For me, it is difficult to see North By Northwest so closely after recent viewings of Vertigo, the film preceding it in Hitchcock's canon, as there is no way that it can match Vertigo's emotional and evocative power or legacy. Yet, consider this: in a three year span, Hitchcock crafted Vertigo, North By Northwest, and Psycho, each film a distinctly American classic, each film a template for all subsequent films of the genre to follow and imitate, each film still eminently watchable and compelling. What director has ever had such a prolific burst of filmmaking? Consider Roger O. Thornhill (the O stands for nothing!) as a Mad Man of Madison Avenue advertising, a contemporary to Don Draper who dictates his letters to his secretary as he steals cabs, frets about his theater tickets, fusses over his mother and his two ex-wives. By raising his hand at an inopportune moment at drinks in a restaurant, Thornhill is mistaken for spy George Kaplan by some tough guys. A gun is drawn, Thornhill is spirited away to a remote mansion where the elegantly ominous Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) grills him on what he knows. And true to his middle name, Thornhill knows nothing! So, Thornhill becomes wrapped up in the life of his double, George Kaplan, finding himself in deadly situation after deadly situation, as he becomes embroiled in a tale of international intrigue. The character of Roger Thornhill is the precursor to many classic movie heroes: John McLane in Die Hard, outwitting the terrorists verbally and physically; The Fugitive's Dr. Richard Kimble, the accused man out to clear his name, shunning eye contact with people on the CTA who are reading papers that have his picture on them; The Big Lebowski shamelessly cribs two key moments from this film as The Dude deals with the Chief of Police in Malibu (Very reactionary!) and finds a phone message on a notepad from Jackie Treehorn; both Ethan Hunt from Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol and the man from Man on a Ledge, two quick- thinking heroes who stand outside buildings high up in the air contemplating escape routes as well as death. Sequence after sequence in North By Northwest is groundbreaking and still with us today in the echoes of modern action and chase films. Thornhill evading the police on the train. Disguising himself. Sneaking up to the house and eavesdropping. Finding an address. Dropping his matchbook. What I like most about Grant's performance as Thornhill is his conveyance of genuine annoyance of the confusion caused at times by the double George Kaplan, his exasperation at his circumstances, his sense of righteousness in clearing his name, and his elegantly graceful movements and style. ""But I have theater tickets! Tonight! With mother!"" he tells his captors at one point, and Thornhill's annoyance converts brilliantly to bitterest gall at his betrayal. I haven't seen many other Cary Grant performances, but this one is brilliant. Hitchcock's confidence in his storytelling allows there to be stretches of silence where Thornhill creeps around, listening and climbing around a Rapids City base for Vandamm and his Communist camp. Hermann's score drives these scenes, but not in an overpowering way. Rather, the score is the pulse of the film, driving and insistent and full of scary wonder. The centerpiece of the film is the bravura sequence involving a low-flying crop duster plane about ninety minutes outside of Chicago as a confused Thornhill awaits his supposed meeting with George Kaplan. The crane shot of Thornhill standing at the desolate, almost desert-like crossroads of rural Indiana farmland is classic, existential, and evocative (referenced in films as wide as Cast Away to O Brother, Where Art Thou?), and as Thornhill wanders and wonders about, the engine of the crop duster cuts in and out of the soundtrack in the background. When the plane finally does what it does, the result is terrifying and must have been even more so in 1959. What a perfect image for the hunted man in the wrong place at the wrong time! What surprised me was how long this sequence was. Hitchcock took over ten minutes to set up the scene before the madness started. His patience is one of the things that make him the master of suspense. Even though I knew what was coming this time, it was upsetting and moving to see it play out. And the end to the scene is a classic action film trope still with us today. And Eve Kendall and Roger Thornhill's flirtatious banter on the train to Chicago has to be a cinematic high point. Both actors are so comfortable and appear to be having so much fun with the provocative lines and coy propositions. The lines caused great laughter in my audience at the Sundance Theater in Houston in 2012, so I have to imagine the forwardness and frankness they must have evoked in 1959. The conversation's context, the traveling of the pair west from New York, is important; Hitchcock slows the film down to give us at least twenty minutes on the train, moving with the characters, savoring the journey and the chase.And the film's final shot? One of the greatest innuendos of cinema as well. The blast of the train horn and the imagery? Brilliant.",North by Northwest
394,author-49568,Incredulous Movie,4,2 September 2016,"While I enjoyed the visuals in the movie purely for escapist reasons and also watching the coolness of the late 1950's (looks a lot like the 1960's to me) I kept thinking, ""How plausible is this really?"" and if one is constantly thinking that despite a desire to have fun watching, that's not a good thing.Basically, my problem is, ""Why is everyone behaving that way?"" For example, the bad guys going after Thornhill at first instance just on the basis of a very flimsy move--just standing up really at the wrong time. You'd think experienced spies would look for far more clues, like following him home, checking his statistics in official records, etc. I know there was a paging at the time, but still.... I think in real life, the bad guys would have let him go after just a few minutes after realizing they were acting incredulously.Secondly, there was no reason for the femme fatale Kendall to be so friendly to Thornhill... okay, maybe she's attracted to him regardless, but a lot of the time she helps him and at other times she totally forgets him, even sends him to certain death (by the crop duster plane). What? There wasn't consistency. It was hard to believe she worried about him at all, and at the end she loves him? Please.Thirdly, it was so complicated for the bad guys to send Thornhill in the middle of barren countryside. Huh? Just gun him down in a dark alley, why go to such trouble. It seemed the entire movie was written just for visual effects, not on the basis of reality. Yeah, yeah, I know movies aren't reality, but still, this was so unbelievable that it left a hollow feeling inside me, wondering why it couldn't at least make sense. Another problem with sending Thornhill so far out in the middle of nowhere... the female agent Kendall tells him to go, right? Obviously the bad guys want him to go there to meet his end (complicated way of doing it, but anyway...). But at the same time, (spoiler, but it's been decades since this movie was out) she's a double agent, so why would under her ""government agent role"" she send him to his doom? She would at least pretend to fumble the instructions, but no, she cruelly and callously sends him to certain death (does anyone really think he would have escaped if this wasn't a movie?). And why wouldn't the government, if it wants to keep Thornhill alive, know of (through Kendall) or instruct Kendall to not send Thornhill to a fight he can't win? Baffling.Fourthly, I know security was far less in the ol' days, but Thornhill could go inside a United Nations building and meet a diplomat there, and the diplomat says yes right away instead of channeling through staff? Surely in the history of diplomacy in hundreds of years were far more professional and sensible than that. And the diplomats would stick around in waiting rooms where there's a crowd and anyone could have emerged from the gritty streets? They work in offices, and they're very busy, usually with weeks booked in advance.Fifthly, why did Thornhill keep going and seek the answer to all this? I know without Thornhill, the movie would have ended right there, but he doesn't have any personal stake in the outcome (true, he becomes attached to the safety of the female Kendall near the end, but that comes in pretty late in the movie) so I felt as if he was detached from what was really at stake in the movie. He doesn't passionately believe in saving America from secrets, nor is anyone in his family threatened, nor is he seeking fortune, so what was his motivation for hanging in so long at great danger? With him going through so many situations, with so much danger already happening in different ways, I couldn't understand why he kept going. All he had to do was hide out and stay with family or something. Yeah I know, it's a movie, so he has to keep going. That's the plot problem of using a main character as disinterested bystander who still discovers no personal stake as the movie drags on (as opposed to other movies where the unwitting hero starts to learn about and feel strongly about an injustice against a person or a group, or finds out secrets that could lead to personal fortune, or avenges someone close to him).Okay, so the scenes in the barren farmland and at Mount Rushmore, (Really? You can own a property on top of Mount Rushmore, just a ten minute run away from the famous faces!) okay, they don't make sense, but I think people like the movie because of these two scenes, without them, I think this movie would not be as famous today. I agree these scenes are exciting and original, and fresh to watch, but I have to cast aside disbelief to enjoy these (and I do enjoy). The problem is I can't cast aside my disbelief for the other scenes of the movie, about 90% of it in fact.Well, there's more, and I could go on and on, but those are the things at the top of my head. And why in some scenes do the bad guys hold back (crowds sometimes stop them, sometimes the crowds still don't stop the bad guys from extracting Thornhill away) and in other scenes do the bad guys act foolishly in eagerness. Very selective motives if you ask me. To please the writers.The movie was written for its visual effects and to make the story continue no matter what to make sure it was slightly over two hours. That's all I think it was. Excellent visuals at times (and the 1960's colour and ""cool"" styles and historical reference) and thrilling showcases of famous landmarks that aren't overused in other movies, though.",North by Northwest

The plot had interesting twists that left me puzzled with a constant cycle of trying to figure out who's good and this not. There was a healthy balance of romance, comedy, and the most important, explosions.I think the idea of having his mother as a sort of comedic character as well.

398,Rikichi,North by Northwest proves that great art can also be entertaining.,10,25 April 2006,"Alfred Hitchcock made this film at the height of his genius and also at the height of his popularity, when his television show gave him the kind of exposure and face recognition usually reserved for only the biggest stars. Hitch always maintained that great films should also entertain, North by Northwest being presented here as our star witness to prove his assertion to be correct.Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill as the slick Madison Avenue advertising man who is mistaken to be George Kaplin, a spy hot on the trail of Phillip Vandamm, played masterfully by James Mason. All we really know about Thornhill is the statement he makes to Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) on the train from New York to Chicago that he has a mother, several bartenders and two ex-wives dependant upon him for support. The ""O"" used to initial his middle name stands for ""nothing"" and his initials, R.O.T., sum up his life. These details are revealing and the scene is beautifully crafted, showing us the apparent emptiness of his life prior to this adventure. Ernst Lehman's script is loaded with these types of gems throughout the picture.If you're really not into excellent dialogue and clever acting and prefer that the story get on with it, this also is the movie for you, as it has two of the most memorable action sequences in the history of motion pictures. Of course I'm referring to the crop dusting sequence and the finale on top of Mount Rushmore. Those are enough to put this movie near the top of anyone's must see list.Kudos are also due to Leo G. Carroll in one of his best character roles as The Professor, who's humble appearance belies the fact that he is the one who is responsible for manipulating much of the action behind the scenes. A young Martin Landau, as Leonard, Vandamm's ""right arm"", shows us in the few scenes that he's in what a capable actor he was. The music by the great Bernard Herrmann is one of the classic pieces that made him famous, starting from the clever opening title sequence to it's conclusion.If we view this movie in its historical context of 1959, we see that it was made in the middle of the Cold War, and much of the suspense is reliant upon the audience's reality of living with the knowledge that everything could end with the press of a button (I know this is too simplistic, but many people's perception at this point in history was just that). The Professor, Vandamm, Ms. Kendall, Leonard and others are Cold Warriors, and it is Thornhill's misfortune to become swept up in it's intrigues, but our very great fortune to be able to get swept up with him and let Hitcock, the ""Master of Suspense"", be our guide in one of his masterworks.",North by Northwest

And at the Mount Rushmore cafe, as Grant slowly walks around the room he passes a man in a red shirt, at the entrance, then a lady with a red blouse cuts in front of him as he buys coffee, and lastly when he sits down right next to a blonde girl in a brilliant red sweater. Of course, he gets shot by Eva Marie Saint a few minutes later.

405,pietoso,Only Ad Men Have Wings,8,16 November 2020,"Adeptly balancing the essence of a thriller with a frequently lighthearted and comedic tone, North by Northwest displays the famous craftsmanship of its iconic director, Alfred Hitchcock, while serving as an ideal showcase for its considerably talented star. Cary Grant is perfectly cast in his role as advertising exec Roger Thornhill, a man so wily and even slimily credible that he is easily mistaken for a spy, and soon manages to actually fulfill the part as events demand. His love interest is played by Eva Marie Saint, excellently opaque and mysterious as long as the script requires, although less enjoyable as she becomes something of the reformed maiden in need of our hero's deliverance. Unfortunately the film seems to make something of a minor habit of this, presenting genuinely compelling ideas and playing with them to our torment, only to abandon them for convention once a conclusion is called for. Overall though, the film generates a considerable degree of excitement and certain scenes, one involving a crop duster and another a famous national monument, carry a great deal of momentum and form a lasting impression. The former especially shows the genius of Hitchcock at work: an innocuous thing becomes conspicuous, then ambiguously threatening, growing on the horizon until it's revealed as the image of death itself. A shot of Grant running like a madman through desolate farm field, imminent doom swooping down from behind him, is as immediately real in our sensory experience as any. But at its best, the film seems to insert subtle commentary through philosophical vectors: is there such an incredible difference between the manipulations of an ad man versus a government spook? Is the American system as benevolent as it suggests, or is it sometimes disturbingly inhumane in its adherence to pragmatism? Thornhill certainly approaches these issues as he flees from each progressive threat, but ultimately the film seems more interested in asking such questions than answering them; doubtless it thrives on this uncertainty by its very nature. For a film addressing the complexities and frequent ugliness of Cold War intrigues, it manages an impressive feat by maintaining a humorous composure despite its realistically uncomfortable premise. Although it avoids further depth, it presents a dreamlike odyssey across '50s America without losing sight of its paramount function: to entertain.",North by Northwest
406,pablofuray,Great Hitch film,9,4 April 2002,"Another super classic Hitch film, great suspence, with typical Hitchcock camera angles. Cary Grant is mistaken for someone else, ending up being in the wrong place at the wrong time, where someone murders a UN representative, Grant is seen as the murderer and a mass manhunt ensues. The famous low flying airplane scene is in this film also, keep an eye out for it. Cary Grant is in the middle of nowhere and a plane starts to chase and shoot at him. The ending is equally famous ending at Mount Rushmore.A truly great film from start to finish.",North by Northwest
407,alg11297,"Over praised, small shaving brush and small razor",1,11 September 2018,"I saw this film a long time ago on tv and finally watched on computer again. What a disappointment. No only is the music bad, but the dialogue is terrible, and Eva Marie Saint, who looks likes she has flashbulbs in her eyes, speaks so slowly and in such a monotone it's hard to believe Hitchcock would consider her for that role. The plot keeps getting stranger and stranger and all about two spies who don't seem to walk around with bodyguards or are armed themselves. Too many coincidences, and not enough intrigue. Sorry.
IN ADDITION, there is a point where Grant goes through Eva Marie's personal stuff and musingly finds her very small shaving brush and very small shaver. He later uses them in the bathroom of the Rail Road station and it seems to take him an extra amount of time to shave. Is this a reference to the fact that Eva Marie is such a hot woman that she shaves her ladies' parts and uses these small instruments? Does that make her hotter. Or is my dirty mind just rolling away with me.",North by Northwest
408,mjb0123,The Leader of the Pack of movies--imitated but never exceeded,9,3 April 2005,"At first, North by Northwest, directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant from 1959, has the feeling of ""I've seen it before."" That's because many moviegoers probably have seen it many times--in other movies since 1959 that were so inspired by it that they put their own spin on it. You feel like you've seen it before because it was the first of its kind, spawning many rehashes, rip-offs, and remakes.Cary Grant gets abducted under mistaken identity as a secret agent. He gets away but nobody believes him and he alone searches out for the truth. But the truth puts him straight into a secret agent world of death and secrets and he gets blamed for knifing a top official in the United Nations. That scene alone is marvelous because as it enfolds, you shout at the character not to touch the thrown knife. ""No! They'll think YOU did it!"" That is precisely what the bad guys want, but anyone in that situation would probably act just like Grant does, clutching the man to help, figuring out what this thing is in his back.Amazingly done throughout the movie is the suspense that this normal man is thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Some of his escapes are just cerebrally cool, as he causes a ruckus at the auction to be taken out by the police instead of taken out back by the bad guys. The scene where the famous biplane tries to chase him down in the middle of a field is the antithesis to noir classics where a dark alley conceals death. The open field is scarier, in that the world is open but there is nowhere to hide. The climax atop Mt. Rushmore is a cinematic gem. You will always remember it when you see pictures. Visiting the monument in 1999, I said to myself, ""Look! Cary Grant!"" Go see this movie. I give it my highest possible recommendation and this is one of Hitch's best.",North by Northwest
409,kfurnas,ahead of its time,7,27 May 2000,"It's interesting for a younger generation to watch movies such as ""North by Northwest"" to see just how much recent movies rip off original ideas.""North by Northwest"" is a spectacular suspense movie (I would not classify it as a thriller or action), with a keen script and even keener delivery of the lines. Cary Grant is commanding in his role as a fugitive from the law, while Eva Marie Grant is captivating as the femme fatale.I did have my problems with the film. As with most movies of the period, it dragged on at points. While Grant and Saint have a nice on-screen chemistry, Hitchcock at times dwells too much on the duo and not enough on the intriguing storyline.Plus, the movie has unnecessary exposition. There is a lot of emphasis on making the viewer realize Grant's character is a fast-thinking businessman at the opening of the movie, but the story never gets back to that. Grant's character never really has the chance to evolve, he just simply changes.But overall, this movie triumphs because of the pace at which the viewer learns interesting details. Unlike most current Hollywood flicks in which the viewer has to wait until the end to learn anything (and the rest of the movie is spent trying to guess its secrets), ""North by Northwest"" lays down all its cards well before the movie's climax. The result is a story that is interesting throughout the entire film, as well as proof of Hitchcock's genius in direction.",North by Northwest

I plan to buy the DVD and see it a few more times to make up for all the years I missed it. I loved the train scenes; I miss the old beautiful passenger trains. I thought the house in South Dakota was magnificent; it looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright house, or a Mies van der Rohe possibly. Eva Marie Saint was lovely in the movie.

411,gmc1-823-758803,"Looks great, but is a confused, less than shallow film",4,21 March 2017,"They had great cameras in those days, and from this comes the best points about this film - the cameras and how they were used. Very atmospheric, the cinematography is very well done and the visual editing very good.It's possibly better today at home in its excellent transfer to digital. (I rented the streaming film in SD, which was great quality on a computer monitor which is not large.)For me, though, that's nearly as far as it goes. The acting has a lot to commend it at times, and Cary Grant pulls off well what is very demanding - trying to tie the script's lack of conviction and film genre identity together.North by Northwest must be the most contrived of all spy films.It also fails as a typical Hitchcock entertainment piece, I think because the subject is always on the verge of real seriousness. But the film can never devote itself to such seriousness in the way that classic spy films do and in the way these subjects really deserve actually.Too far away from Sunday apple pie movie land to be endearing, too bitty, flimsy, theatrical and unsatisfying to be effective in basic thriller terms, and too unserious and kid glove hewn to be worth its salt amongst the lexicon of classic spy films.North by Northwest was a probably an impressive showpiece for cinematography and the potential of atmosphere and brilliance in the track from camera to cinema screen.

413,Danarella,Grant and Hitchcock's best collaboration,9,10 May 2010,"Cary Grant is just so darn charming! In everything he does, he creates a memorable character, but none of his roles are better than the ones he has when he works with the great Alfred Hitchcock. North by Northwest is arguably Grant's best role, as well as one of the best from Hitch. It is a case of mistaken identity that leads Roger O. Thornhill, played by Grant, from Manhattan all the way to Mount Rushmore. Two goons are lead to believe that he is a Mr. Kaplan, and this mistake leads Thornhill to a meeting at the United Nations where he is framed for murder.Besides the leading man, the best part of this film is the engaging script. The story came out of a few interesting ideas that Hitchcock wanted to use for a film. A screenwriter was hired to put the scenes together, which is how we get this film that moves quickly and travels through major monuments of the country. In spite of all the fantastic settings, I consider the scene at the auction to be one of the most impressive scenes in the film. Thornhill confronts the villain, Phillip Vandamm, in which neither of them can fight.Eva Marie Saint does a great job as Thornhill's romantic interest with a secret, Eve Kendall. She is a classic Hitchcock female foil, with blond hair and an icy stare. Even before her identity is revealed, the audience senses that she is more than just a woman sitting at a table on a train. The sexual tension between Thornhill and Kendall is palpable in every scene, which makes the finale all the more climactic.I highly recommend this film to anyone. It has action, romance, suspense and humor and is crafted by arguably one of the greatest directors of all time.",North by Northwest
414,cutsman-2,The Best Hitchcock Film?,10,1 May 2010,"It's touch to pick a best Hitchcock, because you have to look at the whole spectrum of films and categorize them. You have your thriller films, smaller films, and mainstream ones. Or at least that is how I could divide them. North by Northwest would most certainly belong in his mainstream films category and would most certainly be his best easily within that respective category and possibly his best film period. NXNW finds Hitchcock at the top of his form. No doubt he showed early technically impressive signs, most especially with the film Rope, which was made up entirely of two takes. Here though Hitchcock is at this most confident, his most steady. It's had to imagine the story came from the idea to use a bunch of different set pieces because the story is one of the best parts of the movie. Again he uses his staple of mistaken identity, but Cary Grant goes above and beyond the call of duty being particular awesome as Roger O. Thornhill a New York Mad Man. A run though of the plot would be a little dumb at this point, but just know that Grant gets framed as a murderer and has to track down the killers and clear his name. Along the way we runs into Eva Marie Saint, who may or may not be someone to trust. The two share some real chemistry, which sort of grounds a film that is a bit ridiculous (in a good way). Some may say that it is a little long, but the pacing is perfect, there is never really a dull moment, plus wasn't that abomination Transformers 2 longer, and everyone seen that.The film is full of iconic scenes, the crop duster scene, Mount Rushmore, etc. What is most interesting is that I've heard of comparisons of this to James Bond, but the first Bond film didn't come out till the following year. North by Northwest may very well be Hitchcock's best film, if not it is right up there with Vertigo and Rear Window. I think the fact that he made those three brilliant films alone amazing enough.",North by Northwest
415,manjavhern,"Alfred Hitchcock, enough said!",10,10 May 2010,"I saw this film for film history class, and I am not addicted to all Alfred Hitchcock films! Ever since I can remember I heard of films by Alfred Hitchcock and barely saw his film North by Northwest, and now I know why he is considered a master of film. The film was top notch from beginning to end. I could not get enough from the brilliant story and characters. The comedy was so great in the movie that I could not stop laughing the whole time with so smart and witty dialogue. The movie was suspenseful and entertaining, one of Alfred Hitchcock's areas of perfection. A case of mistaken identity, witty characters and humor, throw in a love interest and you have a great movie done by a wonderful director. The scene on top of the U.N. building was a beautiful spectacle and should be viewed on the big screen in high def. Even today the film is held with high standards and referenced a throughout many TV shows and films. The infamous airplane scene is still paid homage today. The protagonist is a regular guy who just happens to be at the right spot at the wrong time and be mistaken for someone who doesn't exist. The ending did seem to drag on a bit, then just end abruptly, but other than that I had no complaints about the movie. I loved how Alfred Hitchcock stuck it to the man by having the train enters the tunnel in the end, to reference sexual activity between the couple, when the production company did not want a love scene between the two in the end; a masterful loop hole found and used to the advantage of the director and audience. Everyone should see the movie at least one time, and guaranteed you will enjoy this fun filled comedic ride of a movie. From there you will be addicted to all Alfred Hitchcock movies and beg for more.",North by Northwest

In the beginning, it's as if you are Roger Thornhill because you become just as confused as he about why he is being kidnapped. When Eve is introduced, I didn't really think much of her, I just thought she was a love interest. Her role as a spy seemed different for the time because not many women were put in such a powerful role. The look of the film is very pleasing to the eye, the costumes and the colors are very vibrant and kept my attention. The suspense of the film was very captivating, it kept me wondering what was going to happen next. Even when Roger gets ""shot"" in the cafeteria, I was afraid that it was over and that he wouldn't make it. Alas, it was a trick and that same trick gun would end up saving him again later in the film.",North by Northwest

Eve Kendall although absolutely gorgeous is clearly not 26 years old.
Roger Thornhill mother was played by a lady only 6 years older than him.
Also during the film.
Eve is completely smitten with Roger Thornhill, but sends him off to get killed and he doesn't seem to hold it against her.

420,CinePhile-istine,"Now, quite firmly my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie",10,10 August 2015,"I watched my first Hitchcock movie, Psycho, in my last year of high school and I immediately became a fan. Over the following 25 years though I have noticed that my favorite Hitchcock movie has continued to change. It was Psycho for many years, but sometime in the mid- 1990s, it became Vertigo (coincidentally a time when a new restored print of that came out). Apart from the beautiful new print (which I also saw on the big screen), I was probably somewhat also swayed by the Sight & Sound critics poll where Vertigo had just displaced Citizen Kane as the greatest movie of all times. But, for the past ten years or so, North by Northwest has become my favorite Hitchcock movie of all times. It is the one I find myself watching over and over again (just caught it on the big screen, for a change). It is also the one I find myself recommending to others, when they ask what Hitchcock movie should they start with. I guess the reason for this is that it is the most ""perfect"" Hitchcock movie. It has all the elements: the Macguffin, the wrongly-accused leading man, and the blonde woman who may or may not be who she claims to be. More than that, it has in one single movie everything that you will find in separate Hitchcock movies: a great screenplay (by Ernest Lehman), fantastic score (Bernard Herrman, obviously), great title sequence (Saul Bass), crackling dialogue and humor, and great chemistry between the leads (similar to 39 Steps). The interplay between Cary Grant (at his best - and more than Jimmy Stewart, the perfect Hitchcock lead) and Eve Marie Saint when they first meet on the train is an exercise in great writing and acting - it could be from any great romantic movie. But most of all it has some of the great set-pieces assembled in the movies - the crop-dusting and Mount Rushmore sequences are already classics. Yes, it doesn't have the psychological complexity of Vertigo, the shock and horror of Psycho, but it is what it is: the most ENTERTAINING movie that Hitchcock ever made, and the one I can watch over and over again.",North by Northwest

This time around, as much as I loved the mystery and thriller elements (that plane scene! who is Mr. Kaplan?), I noticed the chemistry beween Eva Marie Saint and Cary Grant far more.The scene in the restaurant carriage on the train is a treatise on how to flirt on-screen and, I confess, I had to check the date of the film. Yes, this is from 1959 and not some swinging Sixties free-love frolic. Watching two actors of the calibre of Saint and Grant spar with each other is truly wonderful, it all feels so real and therefore it sells the rest of the film to us, including famoust Mount Rushmore pursuit. Without the sexual tension that Grant and Saint portray, all of Thornhill's actions to save damsel-in-distress Kendall would seem un-warranted at least and, at most, a little bit stalkery and bizarre.As it stands, North by Northwest is a practically perfect film of the genre romcom spy thriller.

Hitchcock used this plot device before in many of his films; the innocent man caught up in circumstances beyond his control (""The Wrong Man"", ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"").

Add James Mason as the villain (Mason has a great voice... close your eyes sometimes when watching...chilling!), Martin Landau as his henchman, and Eva Marie Saint as the cool blonde equals a great film.What other Hitchcock film can boast of not one but two famous suspense scenes?  Cary Grant being chased down by a dustcropper will be talked about and studied in film schools for years to come.  The chase across Mt.

431,LibertyValance27-1,Hitchcock once again proves why he is the master of suspense!,10,16 February 2005,"North by Northwest is a suspenseful spy thriller Hitchcockian style! Watching the film now, years after the arrival of that other spy master, James Bond, comparisons can be made between the two. Many of the elements that made this film a success and enjoyable to watch become staples in the later Bond movie series. A beautiful yet mysterious femme fatal, exciting chase sequences, masterful escapism, and ruthless villains. All are here and several years before the first Bond film, Dr. No was released in 1962.Of all that is said for how great this film is, and it is GREAT. I think that the suspenseful nature of the film is overlooked. I think that may be because it has much more humor than most Hitchcock films do. But this film is a real nail-biter, especially the famous finale that takes place on top of Mt. Rushmore! But all throughout the film is very suspenseful and full of Bond-like escapist action. Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a New York advertising agent, who is mistaken for super spy George Kaplan. He is suddenly thrust into the world of danger and espionage. After Thornhill successfully survives an assassination attempt(a rather ludicrous way to murder someone, but this is the movies, suspend disbelief.) he then attempts to find out who his attempted killers are and who it was they mistook him for. Along the way he meets a beautiful agent Eva Kendall, played convincingly by Eva Marie Saint. She tries to help Thornhill, but he is not sure which side she is on. Thornhill finds out that Kaplan, the man he was mistaken for is actually a decoy created by western intelligence in order to confuse and shift suspicion away from their real agent Kendall, who is working under the nose of the eastern agents. Thornhill does something that could potential out Kendall to the eastern agents, and then he feels obligated to save Kendall. It is actually a healthy mix of love and obligation and perhaps a desire for a little excitement that leads Thornhill to assume the fictitious role of Kaplan and help rescue Kendall and assist the western agents in capturing the eastern agents.With the great locations, chase scenes, and great story, North by Northwest is another triumph for Hitchcock, and an all around entertaining film.",North by Northwest

Here's some parts of this motion picture I want to point out some interesting moments in this movie: In the mid-to-end part of this movie, Cary Grant's character gets stuck in the desert and gets chased by a crop duster plane into a wheat field. Why did the crop duster chase him? Well, he became a wanted man when he drove a stolen automobile under the influence of Alcohol. What else can I point out in this movie that I'm sure no one else will: When Eva Marie Saint's character falls off Mount Rushmore, Cary Grant's character rescues her from the evil motorcyclists who don't like him.

Hitchcock wasn't content with any ordinary house to be the villain's headquarters -- it had to be a specially-constructed Frank Lloyd Wright house, on a studio set. And why Mount Rushmore? I've spent years thinking about why he chose that one. Did Ernest Lehman write a script and submit it to Hitchcock, or did Hitchhock go to Lehman and say, ""Write me a script with these elements""? Or did they meet in a room and collaborate? There is lots of money being spent in lots of places. Hitchcock couldn't just film in a grove of trees -- again, it had to be on a perfectly-controlled studio set, where I would imagine every tree was placed exactly correct. I can think of entire movies being shot on the budget it must have taken to create that forest. So sit back and relax and be entertained.

And the character development perfectly goes along with the plot, throughout the movie you'll see Thornhill as a stuck up guy who thinks he knows everything, to a man who figures out he knows nothing, to a man who knows enough to help himself and his newfound love get the life he sees they deserve. The added scenery is far more advanced than the movies of the era because it was taken across the U.S, from New York to Chicago to South Dakota. This movie seems so well throughout and every scene flows perfectly into the next one but the only thing that doesn't flow is your train of thought because none of the outcomes can be scene if you were given a clue. Amazing movie, amazing cast, and amazing plot, I highly recommend it.",North by Northwest

437,butler-britney,North By Northwest,10,4 May 2010,"Let me start by saying Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute genius. North by Northwest is one of his best and encompasses everything that is Hitchcock. Hitchcock once stated a director has to tell the audience what is about to happen to create suspense. If a bomb is about to go off, the director needs to show them the bomb about to go off, but then never delver. Instead of the expected action one must provide an unexpected action instead. North by Northwest (Alfred Hitchcock, US 1959, 131 min.) definitely uses this idea. Roger O. Thornhill, played by Cary Grant (A very attractive man) is an advertising executive who is mistaken as George Kaplan, a government agent, by a criminal gang. As he tries to clear his name and find the actual George Kaplan he experiences many adventures and is introduced to the beautiful Eve Kendall, actress Eve Marie Saint. Throughout the entire story one adventure leads to another and each one provides and unexpected turn of events. George Kaplan, whom Roger is searching turns out to be made up by the government. Eve turns out to be working for the gang, but then turns out to be a double agent. Roger's life depends on the success or failure of the Government obtaining needed information from the gang, which possibly will cost him the new love of his life. Hitchcock's techniques and creative decisions never fail to impress. The detail and artistic direction are superb. The cinematography, the locations, and the mise en scene are beautiful. The development of each character through story, dialogue, and artistically is something to strive for. It is said Hitchcock would accompany his actors to find their costumes because he wanted every detail of the character to develop him or her. As a filmmaker I definitely look up to Hitchcock and strive to accomplish what he has. So far I have discovered it is all about the details.",North by Northwest

I really have no idea how this film is in the top 20. If this film was released today, it would be an average action movie with every cliché in the book. Wisecracking male lead, sexy blonde in leading lady role, devious secretive villain, and climactic ending in which guy and gal barely escape, and fall in love. Where is the brilliance here? The fact that its 50 years old? Just because it was original then doesn't mean it was good. I didn't feel any glaring suspense in this one, and I give it a 5/10 Line# 10",North by Northwest

440,Himadri,"Fine set pieces, but little sense of pacing or structure",5,9 June 1999,"The opening sequences are superb, but, for me, it all goes wrong after the scene in the UN lobby. Just when Hitch should have been tightening the screw, he inserts a scene where a committee of FBI agents reveal to us that they know our hero (Cary Grant) to be innocent. This robs much of what follows of any real tension. Just when the pace should be hotting up, Hitchcock slows things down with that long sequence on the train, which, surprisingly, lacks any sense of danger. As so often with Hitchcock in the 50s, he seemed more interested in glamour than with anything else. And glamour doesn't mix very easily with menace.The famous scene where Cary Grant is attacked by a plane is fine, but it isn't integrated with the rest of the plot. (If someone wanted to kill Cary Grant, why didn't they just hire a gunman instead of a plane?) The plotline is perfunctory: Cary Grant makes his way into the villain's house, and instantly discovers what one of the best FBI agents has failed to uncover in years. The scene at the auction and the final chase on Mount Rushmore are, once again, memorable. But overall, this film appears to confirm my view that while Hitchcock was superb with individual set pieces, he never gave much thought to the overall structure or pacing. Even at his best (e.g. ""The 39 Steps"" or ""Rear Window"") Hitchcock doesn't give an impression of having an artistic vision to impart, which makes his reputation as a great director rather puzzling. No doubt his admirers see more than I do.",North by Northwest

Originally written with Grace Kelly in mind, Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of his game from planting a McGuffin (a device in a movie to serve as the catalyst for the plot) to the side winding twists and turns that keeps the audience guessing and on the edge of their seat.
The visuals are equally as impressive from the crop dusting plane chasing Grant or the ending leading us on top of Mount Rushmore.

Following our title character, Roger Thornhill (played by the late, great, Cary Grant), as he is roped into what may well be the worst case of mistaken identity ever, which then blossoms into a story of international espionage at what would soon be the height of the cold war. But after watching it Some of my favorite things about this movie include the shot that was taken from the outside of the U.N building, since Hitchcock was not able to get permission to film inside of the building itself, and the famous crop duster scene, which will go down in my memory as one of the more unusual encounters from any movie. And furthermore, the ending was a surprisingly happy one, which I was not expecting from the tone of everything else.

449,mcnimitz04,Great Film,9,11 May 2010,"The film,"" North by Northwest"" was released In the United States on July 17 1959. The film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. In the film Roger O. Thornhill is mistaken as a government agent. He is pursued across the country by people trying to kill him. This film is very well made and the director was one of the best in the business. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to make a movie. He paid attention to details in his movies. He knew how to make the audience have the reaction he wanted. The main character in this film, Roger O. Thornhill, was played by Cary Grant. He plays his character very well. His character comes across as the type of person that is trying to figure out what is going on. This film is filled with suspenseful scenes. An example is the many chase scenes of the movie, the audience doesn't know if the police or secret agents will catch him. The audience will always be engaged with the movie during these types of scenes because they can't look away during one of these chase scenes because if they do, they might miss something. Hitchcock is able to keep the audience interested the whole time, which is a big accomplishment even in today's Hollywood. The Female lead in this movie was ale excellent. The leading female character, ""Eva Marie Saint"" did an amazing job with her role. Her along with Cary Grant have great chemistry on the screen. Overall, this film was an amazing display of the talent that Alfred Hitchcock has. He manages to keep the audience interested in the film from start to finish using suspenseful scenes.

It starts at a kinetic pace and never lets up.  Many before me have described the plot outline so without rehashing, let me just say that believability is not the movie's strong suit.  In fact, it is about as ridiculous a storyline as you can imagine.  That's not the point.

453,jonas-adolfsson,Old equals good?,4,8 January 2005,"One of the big IL' movies. Hitchcock. Cary Grant. 8.6 here at IMDb! This move, along with a lot of other ""golden oldies"", are given much too high ratings at IMDb. I argue that the reason for this over rating is that people review movies as if it was sports and not art. Let me explain ;) When you review a world cup soccer match from the 50:s you must take into consideration that the game was much slower, the tactics simple, and that the players were not very well trained, compared to today that is. The world cup final between West Germany and Hungary in 1954 was top quality entertainment, performed by world class artists, if you looked at it 1954. If you look at it today the first thing that strikes you is how much everything has improved. Put simply,the world cup winners of 1954 would not win one match in any division two series in Europe today. But still we can look at the cup final from -54 and say, yeah that was a great game, considering it was played 50 years ago. With art, it's another story. You don't consider, or rather, shouldn't consider, age as a factor. You won't hear anyone say - Yeah, Picasso painted some good shiit back in his days, but he could never compete with today's artists. The same goes for Mozart, Beethoven, Leonardo, Michelangelo etc etc. My argument is that the movie art should be treated as any other art form. Let's apply this to the movie in question. Acting: I would like anyone that gave this movie a rating over 6-7 to look at the car chase scene one more time and tell me what they think of Cary Grants acting in that scene. I can tell you all that one of my friends, at age 15, acted drunk better than old Cary did here. (And nobody even believed that my friend was drunk.) It pisses me off when someone says that the acting is superb in this movie. It is an insult to all actors of today. Plot: I won't bore you with an analysis. Lets just state that the plot is unbelievable and some scenes ridiculous. Script: Hitchcock is said to be the master of suspense. In North by Northwest the suspense level is so low that not even a ten year old would get a pulse from watching it. The dialogue is however smart and funny. Conclusion: Bad acting. Unbelievable plot. Pretty funny. Extremely overrated. 4/10. If you are hungry for a Hitchcock flick, watch Rear window instead.",North by Northwest
454,kevinschwoer,A timeless thriller and a showcase of Hitchcock's film-making power,8,29 October 2008,"A gut wrenching, on the edge of your seat thrill ride is more of an experience than a film. Hitchcock's North by Northwest is a masterful adventure film which throws the audience right in with the lot of the character which reverberates with a tension so thick that you would need a chainsaw to cut it. The film builds off the issue of stolen identity and what Hitchcock does is leave the viewer with just as little knowledge as his main character played by Cary Grant. The film takes no time to pick up the story literally throwing the character into something bigger than him, a very much over his head. The time is so short from when we see the character about his daily life to when he is accused of being someone else that the viewer isn't quite sure who he really is. Hitchcock leaves the viewer lost just as Grant is, giving the plot a forward momentum to find the truth. Later Hitchcock reveals that the government knows about the whole mix up and will do nothing about it which will lead to Grant's death. This is the classic Hitchcock: letting the audience know about something that the character doesn't know, especially something which effects said character. Grant's acting is stiff yet the array of colorful characters around him, and the lighthearted screenplay, allows this to go relatively unnoticed. Instead, Grant's adventure is positively enjoyable especially the electric chemistry between Eva Marie Saint and Grant. The lighthearted elements really come out n their early scenes together which allows Grant to flex his witty, comedic muscles. The climax of the film is set against a history landmark, Mount Rushmore. Hitchcock, who is known for such set pieces, uses the famous monument to show a side which audiences have never seen, literally right up the president's noses. In the end North by Northwest proves to be one of Hitchcock's greatest thrillers highlighting corruption in the government and throughout the world. It will keep audiences on the edge of their seats even today, showing that Hitchcock's genius transcends time.",North by Northwest

North by Northwest may be the most entertaining movie Hitchcock ever made, and that is a big deal when you consider how thoroughly entertaining all of Hitchcock's movies are.North by Northwest is not the most artistic endeavor from the master; in fact, Hitchcock had deliberately set out to make the movie as commercial as possible, without of course compromising on the quality. And that brings us to the question: does quality equate to being artistic? This movie proves that the answer is no. The production quality is crisp, the acting is very competent, and the direction is, as always, great: in short, it is an extremely well crafted movie that leaves the audience fully satisfied and content. The thing that I love most about this movie is the incredible humor, one that reflects the personal sense of humor of Hitchcock. The movie gets into bouts of extremely tense and thrilling moments, and the humor comes in at the perfect moments to give the audience a sense of relief. The movie is a roller-coaster ride of thrill and laughter, but it is entertaining all the way throughout.Ian Fleming, the writer and creator of the James Bond novels, is said to have been inspired by this movie, having based the character of James Bond on that of Cary Grant in North by Northwest.

I'm not complaining that the film is dated (1959 ... nope, no problems with that) or that the film is full of plotholes (only a newspaper film critic will complain about that), but I can't see how the film is interesting. I take it that Cary Grant is playing an unrealistic character, someone who's ordinary but thrown into extraordinary situations, but still doesn't flinch when a crop-duster comes after him or when he's escorted out by strangers with guns. Fine - but where's the charm? Where's the suaveness? Where's the style? I don't feel it. In fact, it came across as VERY fake. I don't see Roger Thornhill - all I see is Cary Grant. I can't understand why the cropduster scene is so memorable - is it because it's the first time there was a movie with a man being chased by a plane in it? I take it that the Mt Rushmore scene is memorable because it's the first time it's been done and no other film has really gone to do it again, but didn't think that was outrageously original (not saying it's not a creative idea, just don't get the hype). Eva Marie Saint is pretty and plays the complicated Eve subtly well. But I don't see Hitchcock's 'master' direction - I can't see what's so unique ... or ... or incredible about it.

His suspense-filled plots, daring situations, and twists were carried throughout North by Northwest. I absolutely LOVED this movie, but then again, it's hard to NOT like any Hitchcock films. Every time you think you know what is going to happen, Hitchcock works his charm and completely changes it. Throwing out twist and turns during the course of the entire movie, he keeps his audience on the edge of their seats. He installs fear into the average person, something commonly seen throughout a lot of his movies. Setting up the plot for an innocent man being wrongly accused for something he had nothing to do with. Hiring a great cast, Hitchcock wanted only the best. Cary Grant portrays his character very well to the fullest extent. Eva Marie Saint also held true to her character. Although this movie has an intense plot filled with suspense, the comedy evens it out pretty well. It is the one-liners from Grant and the predicaments he gets himself into that has the audience laughing. I believe Hitchcock does this in order to relieve the audience from thinking too hard into the plot. Overall, this was an extremely good movie!

461,allamericanpsycho21,Hitchcock's Best,9,11 November 2007,"One of the most interesting elements I found in ""North by Northwest"" was the way that Alfred Hitchcock toyed with the audience with the role of Eve Kendall. Here is a strong, sophisticated, and independent young woman that is neither played as a bitch nor merely eye candy for the hungry male audience. I have found that the crucial weakness of many movies of the 1950's and 60's is the fact that the strong woman must be punished for her independent instincts. In fact, this could easily be argued of many films today. A strong leading female character is just as rare in Hollywood today as it was fifty years ago. If the times have changed, many of the movies surely haven't.One of the many things that I found intriguing by the character of Eve Kendall was her ability to show empathy while, as the same time, staying true to herself. For example, take a look at the scene in which Roger Thornhill tells Eve, in a heartbreakingly real speech, just how much her deception has betrayed him. Even in this scene, where Eve is the ""bad guy"", she is able to show just how much she deeply cares for this man. Maybe it's a sign of great acting or exceptional directing (the close up shot of her just as he leaves is incredible) but, either way, this is a character that we rarely see in movies today.Here is a character that is not only sexual but innocent. She is neither exploited for her actions nor is she looked down on for being a female of carnal needs. If Roger is unsure and wary about sex, Eve knows exactly what she wants and what she shall get.

465,onzehans,classic masterpiece,10,23 November 2000,This one keeps its power so well on tv. So many scenes are Hitchcock originals and copied by so many directors in later years.

466,trickynicky72,Please excuse me while I commit cinematic sacrilege,5,6 June 2001,"As it is clearly demonstrated even in this forum, many, many people love this movie. I just finished viewing it myself for the first time, and frankly, I can't say that I agree. Am I nuts? Maybe. All I know is I'd like to put my two cents in, for what it's worth.For an espionage tale like this, I would have preferred an approach  more based on grim realism. Instead, the narrative seemed a bit too convenient and contrived, as if Old Hitch was trying to make the ends meet at the last minute. Somehow, I never felt the `taut' tension of his other films that I've immensely enjoyed (Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, Psycho, The Wrong Man, Vertigo, to name but a few). It certainly doesn't help that the film contains too many scenes that verge on the `fantastical' level. For example, there's a scene in which a gun goes off in the living room of a house. Eva Marie Saint comes out of her room and asks, `What was that noise,' to which James Mason replies, `We were just wondering about that.' Martin Landau just gives a little shrug and all is forgotten. I mean, come on! I'd say it's pretty hard to mistake a gunshot for, say, somebody dropping a glass on the floor. As I mentioned, there are many more scenes like this during the course of the movie, and every single one of them acts as a decelerator' of the narrative. Also, the overall performance of the cast struck me as rather underwhelming, especially when we're talking about some of the finest actors ever to grace the silver screen. James Mason, in particular, sleepwalks his way through, though I can't blame him, given the fact that his character was so painfully underwritten. The bit when Cary Grant acts like he's drunk was pretty difficult to sit through. Humor is fine when it works on, again, a believable level.I like the idea of having a normal Joe get tangled up in a case of mistaken identity/international espionage. Also, it does feature some memorable scenes, especially the famous crop field/airplane sequence (it really does deserve all the praise it has received) But again, it just proves to me that even a seemingly sure-fire combo like Ernest Lehman-Alfred Hitchcock can still come up short on the goods.The second 007 adventure, `From Russia with Love', received some hounding because people thought it was basically a rip-off of this movie (there are some obvious similarities), but in this madman's humble opinion, `From Russia with Love' is the one that achieves a better telling of a spy story.",North by Northwest
467,CelluloidTape,A wonderful classic,9,15 February 2009,"North By Northwest is one of director Alfred Hitchock's most popular movies. it is a classic and has proved itself to have endured over the years, pleasing new generations of audiences.The story about an advertising executive, who is mistaken for someone else by foreign agents, (and they chase him) was wonderfully written by Ernest Lehman and directed with great style by legendary director Alfred Hitchcock.Hitchcock's direction is, as always, sophisticated. The dialog is smart. The acting by all of the cast members is also smart and sophisticated. Cary Grant plays the male lead and he is sharp, fascinating and a pleasure to watch. In the female lead role, Eva Marie-Saint, as one of Hitchcock's cool blonde ladies, is excellent and sexy in an understated way. James Mason is also an excellent bad guy, as is Martin Landau, who plays a killer.There are some great visually composed scenes that now have become classic images, whenever the history of movie making is discussed.I would recommend this movie to anyone from any background and at any age from young adult to seniors.",North by Northwest
468,Panthro83,Cinematic Gold,10,29 March 2006,"If only all films could be as rewarding to watch as this, I was hooked from start to finish, and would definitely not hesitate in watching it again.This is one of those films that has it all, intricate and well formed plot, likable main character superbly played by Cary grant, and a magnificent all round cast.The chase of Thornhill from place to place, as he in turn is chasing the man he's been mistaken for, keeps you occupied and attentive, waiting for each new problem, new twist in the tale that arrives as Thornhill proceeds.The direction and settings for each scene were sublime, including a fantastic piece of camera work when grant's character gets dropped off in the middle of nowhere by bus to meet the elusive George kaplan. The shot begins with him getting off the bus, and switches to a wide view of the emptiness and bleakness of his current surrounds, as the bus pulls out of view. Then it switches to grant, with the road running next to him, into the distance. The versatility of the direction and camera-work is something sometimes lacking from films, and certainly stands out in this one.The locations were perfectly chosen, from the UN building in new york, to mount Rushmore for the climax. The grandeur of the background only serves to enhance the experience.As far as favourite scenes go, I'd have to go for the dining car on the train, with the banter showing the attraction between thornhill and Kendall, or perhaps the auction room scene, an inspired way to evade capture by thornhill's pursuers.Apart from me being a film geek, north by northwest gives you a fulfilling ride through the frustrations and experiences of Thornhill as he is mistaken for a spy. Wit and humour pepper the dialogue, making you laugh and smile, with Cary grants rough charm accentuating everything.Surely as close to film perfection as it gets. A must see.",North by Northwest
469,zabikhan09,A Trip always worth the ride.....,8,23 November 2011,"Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, the style of film making is composed of a few key traits that results in the movie being ranked so high.The plot is novel and there are plenty of plot twists that keep the audience constantly engaged. The film is a great mystery thriller that has inspired countless films over the years, but remains the gold-standard in classic star vehicles: imaginative, romantic, exciting, funny, and endlessly entertaining. It incorporates a number of Hitchcock trademarks, from visual striking camera work, humour, and his often used technique of keeping the hapless hero in the dark until the end of the movie.The film begins by dropping us right in the middle of confusion: Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), a Madison Avenue business executive, is mistaken for a George Kaplan, supposedly a government agent, by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), a spy. Thornhill insists that Vandamm has the wrong man, but Vandamm is unconvinced and decides to kill him anyway. Thornhill escapes, but ends up on the wrong side of the law. While trying to clear himself, he digs himself deeper into the hole resulting in both the police and Vandamm's thugs hot on his pursuit, resulting in a 3000-mile cross-country chase. While on the run, he bumps into Eve Kendall (Eva Mary Saint) . Thornhill is caught between feelings for Eve, risk of death from Vandamm's goons, and a U.S. government agency with a vested interest in continuing the charade. How all this is resolved in a clear and consistent manner is what makes this script and direction so great.However, writing and direction alone, as imaginative as it is here, do not make for the greatest movies. All of the actors do an excellent job in realizing the potential in the script: Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint offer rock-solid performances. Martin Landau is a great villain as Vandamm's henchman. This is acting at its most brilliant.The dialogues are amazing, they stay in your memory for time to come.The movie is so action-packed that it is easy forget some of the holes in the plot. These are minor quibbles - the plot twists are so numerous, and lead our attention in so many directions that we don't notice Hitchcock's sleight-of-hand.To conclude,NBN is filled with sly humour and many memorable scenes including the unforgettable crop dusting scene and the finale atop Mt. Rushmore, North by Northwest is a trip always worth the ride.",North by Northwest
470,VanceB-275-867175,Great!,9,20 July 2017,"I've finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront. Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock ""as if he'd keep driving"" or ""as if she'd do that""he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10",North by Northwest

It's an interesting and fast paced plot that has plenty of turns, but is never anywhere near convoluted or distracting. It's got pretty much everything you could want from an action movie, and then some. Cary Grant is entertaining as ever, and fills his role perfectly.

But it lacks Hitchcock's taste of macabre,human satire and depth but that's mainly due to the fact that North b n was intended to be different from the earlier Hitchcock movies by having more action and less mystery and drama.this formula pleased the audiences back then but i believe that this is NOT Hitchcock's masterpiece,it has none of that subtle haunting mystery of vertigo,psycho...eva marie saint has a really great character,while cary grant can be annoying sometimes...North by northwest is more like a commercial blockbuster that's really enjoyable to watch but doesn't really linger in ur mind forever...",North by Northwest
478,mccolvil,Translation,9,8 December 2008,"Of all the Hitchcock movies I've seen North by Northwest translates the poorest into my generation. One could speculate that this is because it's been ripped off as much as Chuck Berry. Lucky Number Slevin is your obvious example, but that might not be why it translates so poorly. I think it's the classic shot of Grant and the CIA man with Mt. Rushmore in the background. Most of my peers saw Richie Rich before they saw (if they've seen) North by Northwest and the cheesiness of the older and often wiser generations. I hate to be the kind of guy that doesn't think of technological ability as relative. Especially since it's so often misused in modern cinema to craft a movie with less than 50 pages of a script.I'm holding the position that it doesn't translate well because of this: a) The crop dusting scene is ridiculously suspenseful but can we really imagine how crazy it was in '59? b) same exact story for the Mt. Rushmore cliffhanger scene. c) Grant's banter, if not monitored closely, falls on deaf ears to the people of today, even my parents couldn't catch all the wise-cracks. We just speak a different language. d) Eva Marie Sant's lines are littered with innuendo's that would make a middle schooler's toes curl. Her sexiness has been forgotten by time and slang.So, in short, the reason that North by Northwest doesn't translate into my generation (.com generation if you were wondering) is because it's simply too good, it's shocking and will alter the way that anyone thinks about what constitutes a good movie. It isn't that we don't have the taste, I think it's more that we never had a chance to witness the awesome power of cinema contained within. Don't be offended if you are of equal age with me and plaster pictures of Cary Grant on your wall, I think you would agree with me if I said that this movie was beyond modern comprehension and stood up with some of the greatest artistic works of the last 50 years.",North by Northwest

It's almost impossible to make a good movie from a bad script but very easy to make a bad film from a good script. And here we have 2 of the best joining together to make a film that only asks us to enjoy. But unlike other films that do that this one stays in the memory and will be talked about as long as we talk about film. I hope. It's also a lesson in the importance of strong direction. Mm - a strong director. I understand that Cary Grant was not shy in putting forward his ideas. A big star with a weak director can easily ruin a movie changing everything to make their part bigger. Or simply imposing bad ideas because they are a big star. Let's face it, most actors can barely sign their own name. The suit has been talked about at length in other places and in a brilliant essay taking the suits point of view. The very best thing I think is the wonderful use of colour in every frame. There are lots of scenes where you can hit the pause button and just marvel at the colour and the composition of the frame. And of course one of the most enduring images in film - with Cary Grant running from the plane. Only bad part of that sequence is where the plane crashes into the truck. Doesn't quite work.",North by Northwest
480,superdavein78,Arguably Hitchcock's best,10,24 December 2004,"If there had been no Psycho than this would have been the film Hitch was best remembered for. It has been 46 years and it still grabs me has hard as any great thriller. ""The film that paved the way for Harrison Ford's career "" might be an apropriate epitath for this masterpiece of the genre. The wrong man is accused and he is an everyman who must become a hero and save the day. Chosen by the American Film Institute as well as SuperDave as one of American Film's 100 greatest accomplishments this film has a taunt spy thriller that doesn't require the mental engery and near PhD level intelligence (and caffeine high) that a LeCarre style spy film would require. However the screenplay original titled ""The Man in Lincoln's Ear"" is far from dumbed down. Hitchcock's favorite leading man looks suave and sexy in his suit and like all great Cary Grant performances he is appealing in his believability as much as the way he fills out his suit. Eva Marie Saint, an underapreciated actress of her day, is perfectly cast as the bad girl spy whom you never quite know which side she is on. Undenialbly James Mason makes his case for one of history's most underused villainous actors (before there was Alan Rickman...) While not as serious as some critics would like, it should not have to be. North By Northwest is a popcorn film, meant to entertain and thrill you and it does that in spades.

481,ladsontour69,an original and influential classic from Master of suspense.,8,10 February 2013,"Hopefully Alfred Hitchcock needs to introduction. he is one of the most influential directors of the last 100 years and has made some of the most original and daring films such as 'Psycho' and 'The Birds'. North by Northwest is a cross country caper and a well made one at that. Unlike the horror genre which he explored, this is an action film that stars Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint as the leading roles. its about a ordinary man who is confused as a government agent and is on the run cross country to prove his innocence.First let me say Alfred Hitchcock has a knack for casting strong male actors and beautiful female actresses. they both have brilliant performances and Grant as the charming Roger Thornhill no doubt makes you fall in love with him and his cheeky character instantly.The story is a joy to watch as it always is with Hitchcock. His style of making every scene suspenseful and intense makes this film an absolute rush from the first 5 minutes to the final scene. he manages to keep you entertained throughout the film with not a dull moment. this film has been a huge influence on other films such as 'From Russia with Love' with the famous plane scene.A lot of modern film makers continue to look at and be influenced by Hitchcocks work. His legendary camera shots are used in hundreds of films such as the final scene in this where he pulls the girl up from the mountain and it cuts to him pulling her onto his bed. a risky shot but works ever so well and can be seen in modern films. if you are yet to see a Hitchcock film, this is a great starting point, if you have seen his work, this is another classic from him and quite possibly his most memorable. 9/10",North by Northwest

Why do I think this is the greatest film of all time? (a) The plot is solid (b) The cinematography is eye candy (c) Not one hesitation in action.

492,rabidrobertfan,Northwest Passage,10,24 March 2014,"Confession-this is my favorite Hitchcock film but I do not consider it to be the best one. Nevertheless, North By Northwest, the 1959 suspense/adventure/thriller/romance/mystery starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint is still very worthy of the high acclamation it receives. It could very comfortably fit into any one of the five genres just listed and it is an incredibly fun movie to watch. Ordinary New York businessman Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is abducted and taken to a private mansion where enemy spies plotting against the U.S. government accuse him of being an American spy named George Kaplan. He repeatedly insists that he is not George Kaplan and after escaping, ends up running for his life through various states while being pursued by both the enemy spies and the police, who have framed him for murder. I will not reveal the rest of the plot as it would take me way too long to remember all the twists and turns. North By Northwest has some memorable scenes. The most famous one depicts Thornhill being chased by a crop duster plane. Also, the climax is pretty suspenseful as well. But I think what I love most about this movie is the way it has aged. It's fifty-five years old yet I still feel it could have been released last Friday and still have done as well financially as it did back in 1959. I guess if I had to say one thing against this film, it would be during the climb down Mt. Rushmore. Seriously, do you really think a man and woman could scale and climb down the steep sides of Mount Rushmore with any success while wearing dress shoes and high heels? But that's just me getting really picky. North By Northwest is so much fun to watch. The first time I saw it, I didn't even understand half of what was going on yet I still was enjoying the movie. I remember the second time I watched it, I had so much fun that when it was over, I just wanted to stick the DVD back in and watch it again immediately. Thankfully, I got the 50th Anniversary DVD for Christmas so maybe one day that will happen Oh, and one last note, the main theme to North By Northwest is probably my all-time favorite movie soundtrack theme.

But as with so many other 'classics', so many other pieces of 'perfect' film making I was horribly disappointed, and why? The film had so much going for it, but the fact of the matter is that by the end of the film I had lost 2 hours of my life that I will never get back and what is even more tragic is that Hitch lost months.It is easier to list the few good points than the masses of things wrong with this film so I'll start there: Cary Grant; James Mason; the direction (possibly; certainly not Hitchcock's best); the message that if you (the audience) value your masculinity you too will take the first opportunity to drink drive your way out of a perilous situation and let's not forget possibly the greatest moment in ANY Hitchcock film; train through the tunnel metaphor.But now for the rather more in depth list of terrible elements: I'll begin with the most prominent; the cheese, this film has cheese flowing out of the screen, and people argue that it spawned the stereotype rather than is part of it, but is that a good thing? Really? To have created a strain of films not only containing James Bond, but ultimately Tripple X. The direction, save for the crop duster scene is average at best.

The fact that it remains a much-loved film by all is enough to say it has stood the test of time. I much regret that I did not have the opportunity to see it when it first came out and was groundbreaking in its complexity and brilliance. It came out in a period where the vast majorities of mystery/thrillers were neither mysterious nor thrilling, yet this proved to be both, even today. Had I seen it when it first hit the big screen, I undoubtedly would have rated it 10/10, yet the reasons for the subtraction of points are minimal and probably anal. Firstly, while the ending on the obviously green-screened Mount Rushmore is thrilling, it came off as slightly cheesy, and not exactly the dynamic finish I have witnesses in some more recent thrillers. Secondly, I think that some of the scenes between Roger (Cary Grant) and Eve (Eva Marie Saint) drag on just a little too long for my taste, and although they are entertaining, they just don't fit in with the flow of the whole.

There he meets the femme-fatale Kendall, scheduled for him (? - how was this managed at such short hand ?), only a few moments before train's departure for Chicago.F. F. Falls for him (at least, a part of her - viewer would know that after 10 seconds, both sitting in the dining car, they two would finish the film as lovers, together. For the last idiot to grip that, sweet music sets in...)But then Kendall, after arrival in Chicago, sends our unlikely hero (her handlers have instructed her during train ride by notepad to let Thornhill act) coold-blooded to a certain deadly meeting-point out in the fields, where he is attacked by a crop-duster plane (!), with gunfire and spray. But - that quite complicated ""killing by strafing plane"" fails, as plane crashes into gasoline truck !Not that much of a problem for him, Thornhill makes it shortly after to Kendalls hotel-room, love-interested as before. Kendall wants their ways to part. While Thornhill fakes taking a shower, she runs out of the hotel room for a date with her handlers.At an auction - again in a crowd of people - Thornhill manages to catch Kendall with her handlers (Boss Vandamme is Kendalls Boy-friend, a very jealous indeed, soon we would learn. But, btw, he sent her to pick Thornhill up in the train, covering him from police officers searching for this murder suspect & allowing her to have sex with Thornhill in the sleeping compartment at the night ride to Chicago ??)Again threatened by Vandammes armed thugs, here, in this auction crowd, Thornhill employs a trick to get ""saved"" by two police officers (surely, Vandammes henchman would have finished him off, by gun or knife or sth., right in the auction rooms - what ? Please ? I thought, they prefer more difficult methods for eliminating people..suggestion: hit by falling balcony or sth. Like that ?) - Alas, cops bring Thornhill to the Chicago airport, where he learns to know ""the Professor"", a kind of US intelligence mastermind supervising the case (and permanently risking Thornhill's death, while doing this).At Mount Rushmore, instructed double-agent Kendall shots Thornhill with blanks, in a restaurent, dozens of people around being witness. Anyway, she can run out of the place, unimpeded by anybody, get to her car and drive away. Professor, Thornhill and Kendall meet shortly after in the woods. Problems arise between the elderly spare time pre-Bond & his 26-year old love interest !Professor now must conduct the operation somewhat harsher. Thornhill, knocked out by his driver, is brought to kind of Jail-hotel ? - a hotel room which can not be opened from inside. After a chat the Professor is out for a bottle of whiskey for the two of them. Meanwhile, it's practital, that Thornhill can espace from his secure ""cell"" out of the window ! Fine: there's a ledge at hand, so he can easily get to the neighboring window, climb in - pleasently surprising the lady in bed there - quickly gettin' out of her door & so escaping intelligent US security agency's custody !So much for that. Too long stretched. After two hours or so of this rubbish I was served and clicked TV out for good. May this super Hitch masterpiece rest in Peace.(won't bother too much about other laughable details as the casting of a some 8 years older actress as Thornhill's ""mother"")",North by Northwest
497,Gmanol01,Hitchcock keeps popping out the classics...,10,14 November 2001,"When you thought that he's all out of ideas and last minute rescues, Hitchcock comes back with more eye candy and great action. North by Northwest is sometimes called Hitchcock's last great film. Carey Grant and Eva Marie Saint have very good chemistry and the inclusion of not one, not two, not three, but severa plot twists makes this film one of Hitchcock's best.One thing not focused on in this film is the use of camera angles. When Roger is taken to make the telegram, the camera slides from a foreground view of Roger's lunch buddies, to the two standing men in a background view. Also, when Roger awaits George Kaplan in the field, there is a great establishing shot of Roger where there is total silence and calm until the eerie plane is spotted. One last camera technique that Hitchcock perfected was when, in the final moments of the Mount Rushmore chase, Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall were saved by the sniper. The body of the person shot was shown and then a tilt up to the sniper showed the detectives. Little snipets like these were just a few things Hitchcock did well.Overall, this movie was one of the best I've seen ever. For a 1950s movie, it is ahead of it's time and paved the way for future films to imitate many of the innovations that the flick brought to the screen. Go out and see this movie!",North by Northwest
498,alkemawitten,groundbreakingly gripping,9,23 March 2008,"Ever notice how Oprah is trying to pile great life-changing TV-moments on top of one another, time after time? This is exactly what Hitchkock was doing for cinema. The great thing about North by Northwest though, is that he's trying to do it all in one movie.I challenge the reader to name any other title that has so many groundbreaking suspense scenes: the abduction, the drunk driving, the UN-building scene (He has the knife: he's the killer!- oh no!-the paranoia!), the crop duster-scene, the crazy auction (Cary Grant bidding ridiculously high and then claiming the crap isn't worth a buck) and of course the very slow and gripping Mount Rushmore chase-scene.Watching this movie today, it feels easily as fast-paced and gripping as, say, Casino Royale or MI3. It's not overstating to claim that this movie is, in fact, the first Bond(-type) movie, still waiting to be topped.Of course, you have to love Cary Grant, you have to love Technicolor, you have to love the now firmly outdated cardboard characters. If you don't, it's your loss; I beg you: get over yourself!(you don't have to love Oprah) Having said this, I would like to end saluting Eve Kendall and Cary Grant: a match made in heaven. This may not be Hitchcock's finest film, but I think these are his finest leading actors. Eve Kendall is everything you want from a Hitchkock-lady. Women who, under the pretense of ladylikeness, are in fact a tad trashy. So matching the fifties.And Grant is the ideal Hitch-hero: fragile yet masculine, dull, but somehow fascinating.Go watch!",North by Northwest

Still, I'd change that pair of gray socks for a pair of black socks anytime.The plot is full of surprises and it's quite hard to predict anything until much later in the movie, so be prepared for quite a few twists along the movie.

500,sawakatoome,The Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures?,10,5 December 2003,"'North By Northwest' is not only one of Hitchcock's greatest films and greatest successes, its also one of his most influential, the influence felt on countless action flicks. Not least among them is the entire Bond franchise, at which has often been levelled accusations of 'ripping off' both Hitchcock in general and 'North By Northwest' in particular.Hitchcock and his screenwriter, Ernest Lehman, seem to have regarded this film as the ""Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures"". As a sort of compendium of Hitchcock's American work, this comment is fitting. Hitchcock practically invented the chase thriller (with heavy lashings of humour, sex and suspense). (Note- Lehman would subsequently work on the similarly-toned and paced 'The Prize' (1963) which had one major difference ... Hitchcock's absence. The omission is quickly made patently and painfully obvious.)Hitchcock, in his films, often examined the notion of 'the double' in his films ('Shadow of a Doubt', 'Strangers on a Train', 'Frenzy' among them). 'North By Northwest' is no exception. It seems to me that the character of Philip VanDamm can be seen as Thornhill's double, perhaps illuminating a darker, more profound side to the protagonist's personality. Comparisons are invited -- both men are English-accented, suave, sophisticated; both men mistake the other for someone else; both are in love with the same woman.Roger's life is under threat from spies because of a false assumption those spies make and the secret agency whose obligation it should be to help him.. refuse to do so. In fact, the film's two 'parent figures' (Roger's mother, Clara and the 'Professor') are of absolutely no use to Roger, underlining the basic fact that only Roger can save Roger.By 1959, Hitchcock was blessed with being able to use the same people on his films ... cinematographer Robert Burks, editor George Tomasini (who earned himself an Oscar nomination) and composer Bernard Herrmann. Its this that gives 'North By Northwest' its professional and satisfying sheen, never to be bettered.Fergal #.",North by Northwest

[the most recently released spy movies i have seen, 'Spy Games' and 'The Recruit', were abundantly better than this disappointing film, and they are not ranked nearly as high up.]why?  (1) in today's age, this movie's special effects (and plot) are sorely dated; (2) the plot is implausible, whether you look at it from a 2004 antiterror or 1950s Cold War perspective; (3) what some would argue are the film's strongpoints (i.e., the romantic interactions between hero and heroine, Cary Grant's numerous wisecracks, etc.) really contribute to its flaws (see (2)).  saying anymore would spoil the surprise for those who are still planning to see it.want to see the quintessential Hitchcock film?  see 'Rear Window'...i rented it only the day before seeing 'North by Northwest', and its superiority is immediately evident.  even the romantic chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly is better; in fact, i dare you to come up with a better pairing. but it's obvious that 'North by Northwest' isn't even comparable in quality, beyond the fact that it, too, is a Hitchcock production.from my interpretation of this website, anything rated above a '7' is worth seeing, and anything above '8' is a ""definitely see, now!""...for that reason, i have to give this movie a '6'.  this flick is a poor man's James Bond movie.",North by Northwest
502,Npcibrahim,The best 5 Hitchcock,9,1 September 2012,"If Vertigo is unanimously number one, North by Northwest ranks in the top 5, square with Rear Window,Psycho and Notorious in Hitchcock filmography.Why Vertigo? Because of the ingenious cinematographic technicalities of Robert Burks and the music score conducted by Bernard Hermann. Because of the novel D'entre les morts by Boileau et Narcejac. Needless to mention the Technicolor of red and gray of interiors and green and gold of giant sequoias. Kim Novak metamorphosis from a genuine brunette to a Hitchcock's placid blonde is disturbing to Stewart as well to spectators. The elegant silhouette of James Stewart marks all angles, plans and semi plans of Burks. The mysterious and unexpected thrilling drama crescendo contributes to the priority rank of this motion picture. North by Northwest cinematographer is also Robert Burks. Bernard Hermann is the music conductor . Cary Grant tall and elegant silhouette dominates angles and plans of action and exteriors. Eva Marie Saint is a Hitchcock's placid blonde . The theme is one of Alfred's favorite when an ordinary man is wrongly driven in an extraordinary situation ( as in The Wrong Man ,Rear Window,The Birds) is one of Alfred favorite's when an ordinary man is wrongly driven into an extra ordinary situation( as in The Wrong Man, Rear Window, The Birds).",North by Northwest
503,ender_wiggen,A contrived and unbelievable piece of swill that somehow became a classic.,4,26 March 2009,"Now, I like Alfred Hitchcock as much as the next fellow but I can't for the life of me, figure out why this is such a tremendous success and so highly rated. This movie does not make a lick of sense and every bit is so contrived and unrealistic that I was constantly taken out of the film. For example, Cary Grant is in the middle of a dirt road near some crops when out of nowhere a crop duster appears and tries to fly over him and kill him. This is a classic scene but makes little to no sense. Wouldn't it have been easier to run him over with a car or something?Another scene where he meets the heroin is simply laughable. The dialogue is corny (""whenever I meet a beautiful women, I must tell her I want to make love to her"" PLEASE!) and the plot twists are nothing short of offensively stupid. The movie has great sets, like the Mount Rushmore set, but seriously, if a professional knife thrower has a knife, why would he jump at you? Especially on a steep mountain.This movie is contrived and laughable the whole way through, the problem is that its a drama, not a campy 60's batman show.

504,gfarrand,North By Northwest,10,24 July 2005,"The movie ""North by Northwest"" is in my top 10 movies of all time. It combines great suspense, sexual tension between Cary Grant and Eve Saint Marie, Hitchcock's beautiful use of location, color, film angles and monumental scenery. It also wouldn't have been the great movie it is without the evil characters portrayed by James Mason and Martin Landeau and cold blooded government spy played by Lewis J. Carroll, who baby boomers will remember from the TV ""Topper"" series. North by Northwest is one of those movies one can watch dozens of times and still notice something new.

505,Cluey,"Wow, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen",10,24 October 2008,"I bought this on a whim, after someone made a joke about a drawing I'd done (of a man running away from something in a field) striking of Hitchcocks famous scene. After watching it, I am ashamed that I didn't see this instant classic sooner.The film starts off and instantly you are hooked, the snappy dialogue (the brilliant Taxi skit), the comedy (pretty much any scene with Mrs Thornhill Sr) and the thrilling ambiguity and intrigue. The answers come in just the right places, so you're never wondering longer than is reasonable, apart from the scenes where Hitchcock has dragged it out to an amazing edge-of-seat effect.Another thing I loved, apart from the great writing, story and direction, were the characters, a compound of the above three. All the actors do a brilliant job of filling the characters shoes, and Cary Grant is nothing short of irresistibly charming and brash as the troubled hero. Most film-makers nowadays would portray the characters as psychological train wrecks given their circumstance, but they exhibit the cool and likable persona's (even Mr Van Damme is a charming villain) that are sadly missed in most modern films.In fact, a lot of things in this film are sadly missed from modern thrillers, the charm is irresistibly and I've no qualms about giving it a 10 and saying it's one of the coolest films I've ever seen.",North by Northwest
506,brendanm194,The apotheosis of Hitchcock's film-making!,9,19 May 2005,"PLOT DESCRIPTION While having lunch, advertising executive Roger O. Thornhill (Cary Grant) experiences misfortune just as a ""George Kaplan"" is being paged. From this point on, Thornhill's life is turned upside down. He is abducted by three mysterious men and whisked away to the palatial home of enemy spy Philip Vandamm. Denying that his name is Kaplan, Thornhill is at a complete loss when Vandamm begins grilling him for information. Finally, Thornhill is drugged, tossed into a car, and sent careening down a treacherous mountain road. He escapes this death trap only when his car is stopped by a pair of motorcycle cops. Unable to persuade the Law that his stories of kidnappings and enemy agents is true--he can't even convince his own mother--Thornhill takes the cops back to the mansion where he was held prisoner, only to find that Vandamm and company have cleared out, and that house is really owned by a United Nation ambassador.Tracking him down at the UN building, Thornhill tries to get the man's attention--whereupon the ambassador is knifed to death, and the nonplussed Thornhill left holding the weapon! Now a fugitive from justice, Thornhill tries to escape via train. En route, he meets the coolly beautiful Eve Kendall, who graciously hides him from the police. The apotheosis of Alfred Hitchcock's Hollywood career, North by Northwest is fast, funny, and exciting. The film contains far too many highlights to detail in this limited space: favorite bits include the crop duster dusting where there aren't any crops, the riotous auction scene, the mid-film murder of a principal character (or so it seems), and, of course, that nail-biting Mount Rushmore finale.",North by Northwest

Trying to find who Mr. Kaplan was and why they wanted him had me at the edge of my seat. Hitchcocks odd use of color made the screen pop with color for example the taxi. The use of the different shots and angles show a little bit more of the directors technique and letting the audience infer more about the film. Some techniques were very clever for example using a painting instead of the real house and a treadmill for people who were walking. It had you on your toes and laughing at the same time.

Even though nearly every secret is revealed on the DVD, this only helps to enhance the impact of every scene and visual.  Incredibly, Ernest Lehman did not know how to end the movie at Mount Rushmore until he came up with the idea that Eve shots Roger in the dining room area.  Cherish every scene and every line of dialogue as Cary Grant delivers some very funny lines at the expense of the bad guys.  By the way, it's true, Martin Landau was a very strange looking guy at the time and an absolute perfect piece of casting in the role of the sinister and some would say homosexual Leonard.

516,roundater,Great film that has aged well in spite of a few minor flaws.,9,14 August 2005,"Great roller coaster ride of a movie with a few minor flaws. First, I can't imagine a more inept criminal justice system than in Glen Cove: (a) cops crashing their car into a fleeing drunk driver (b) detectives that easily could have exposed the phony Mrs. Townsend (hard to believe they did not already know that the real one was deceased) with a few basic checks, such as the supposed arrival of Thornhill by taxi, his companions at the Oak Bar, the time and circumstances of the theft of the Mercedes, the party guest list, etc. (c) a lawyer letting his client without objection to go to trial on felony charges only one day after the preliminary hearing, and (d) a judge permitting such a quick trial, then letting Thornhill out on bail if his story was supposedly so phony. Second, the scene involving the ""United States Intelligence Agency"" (staying so secret by being conveniently plopped right in the middle of the National Mall with the Capitol background shot) could have been deleted, leaving the mystery of Kaplan's identity for later resolution; the plot would have been enhanced that much more. Third, the scene in the Chicago train station with the cops checking all the red caps was a bit of a stretch; my recollection of 1950's America was that most of them were of a different ethnicity than that shown in the film.But in spite of these and the many other minor flaws and goofs that have been well documented, this is still a great film with superb acting, direction, photography, overall plot and suspense that has aged well, like fine wine. I especially liked the little non-verbal nuances, such as: (a) the expression exchange between Thornhill and the other man shaving in the train station, (b) the looks of skepticism by the New York state cop to Eve Kendall, (c) the flabbergasted look by the Chicago cop when Thornhill is suddenly whisked away by the professor at the airport, and (d) Thornhill looking at the farmer (thinking he is Kaplan) across the road, waiting for him to make the first move. The little snippets of humor in the middle of normally suspenseful or dramatic scenes further added to the enjoyment of viewing the film.

The scene in the elevator with Cary Grant and his mother and the scene at the auction are priceless. My wife and I still think that the man who Cary Grant steals the cab from later went on to play Les Nesmith in WKRP in Cincinatti. This is also a great chance to hear two of the most distinct voices in Movie history, Cary Grant and James Mason. This movie is a delight. Hitchcock also out does himself in picking of all places Mount Rushmore for the climax of the movie. It ranks right up there with the fight scene on the statute of Liberty with Bob Cummings in Saboteur. Hope you get hooked on Hitchcock like me. In conclusion, Hitchcock sets the pace for this non-stop thriller within 5 minutes of the movie and doesn't let go till after the credits. Throughout the entire movie, the one thread that holds it together is the composure of Grant through all the adversities thrown at him.",North by Northwest
534,ryanpillion,The perfect adventure (in my opinion),8,24 June 2020,"Going along with the time period, these pictures just keep getting better and better. The stories of the old films are so entertaining for a kid from future generations to watch and see what's changed and what has stayed the same. The cinematography in this movie is undoubtedly the best so far, but I couldn't really find a deeper meaning in it compared to something like 1917. However masing and the editing done in this movie (very obvious now) was done really good for 1959, you can compare a scene in the taxi where the back window is masked to see the streets even though the lighting is completely off the mask itself fits perfectly with the outline of the window to a scene in star wars a revolutionary film for its time.
The story itself is what kept my attention the most. I really felt for what the character was going through and what he did to overcome it seemed like he was trying to get out of a relationship in his home. When he met the girl on the train you could instantly tell she was involved even before she sent the letter to the antagonist. After getting almost killed by the plane and ending up finding her was very funny because he knew she set him up but he went along with it so he could get the most information out of her and eventually finding out that she works with the man who was chasing him. The only thing about the story that I'm opposed to is the ending, it was very abrupt and even though the transition from mount rushmore to the train car was seamless I would've enjoyed an ending where you see the characters get saved by the park rangers and the protagonist to get a reward.
Wrapping up North by Northwest, this picture has been by far one of the greatest movies I've seen especially for its age. I believe that it should get a higher spot on the list other than 95. Even though the ending wasn't ideal, maybe this one can because it is getting a 8/10.",North by Northwest

538,gouldr,NBNW forerunner to summer movie 'thrill ride',8,8 August 2020,"The Alfred Hitchcock catch me if you can classic, North by Northwest, was the film forerunner to the modern summer blockbuster.
North by Northwest was a distinctly commercial venture after Vertigo. Hitchcock had received some criticism in the '50s as too smoothly commercial, with his Grace Kelly movies, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and 1959's North by Northwest. 1960's Psycho would be his answer to THAT criticism!Here's the complicated plot of NBNW in a nutshell: Devil-may-care ad man Roger Thornhill is abducted by henchmen and taken to spy Philip Vandamm. He is convinced that Roger is an undercover agent. They then engage in a cross-country game of cat/mouse, when a cool blonde enters into the mix of this smart suspense thriller. The deeper Roger gets entangled into this espionage web, the more he realizes there's a thin line between the good guys and bad guys.North by Northwest was Hitch's double whammy with the plot device he called the ""MacGuffin."" This was an inconsequential object of a story that sets everything in motion. While the MacGuffin here is microfilm hidden in an antique, I think that George Caplan, a non-existent person who Cary Grant's ad man is mistaken for, is the real MacGuffin here.NBNW is the epitome of a mid-century movie: sophisticated yet totally entertaining; a clever plot and plenty of action; sexy yet classy; a star and director's vehicle. North by Northwest's story takes the audience across the much of the United States, from NYC to Mount Rushmore. This suspense film is what summer blockbusters call a ""thrill ride."" Unlike many modern versions, North by Northwest was meticulously thought out and filmed, with director Hitchcock at his height of storytelling talents.",North by Northwest

The innuendo's and the craft of it really sold the film for me. A great cast all around, but especially James Mason, whose Yorkshire accent makes anything sound great. Another note is the colors in this film, I really want to figure out what film stock they used because there is something about the coordination of all the colors in the film, from Cary Grants suits to the various McGuffians that propel the story forward.

This movie represents the glory days of Hollywood for me - each time I watch it, I wish that Hollywood made more movies like it today.  Right from the opening credits Bernard Herrmann's thundering score greets you, and you know you're in for a wild ride.  Cary Grant basically defines the term ""movie star"" in the best performance of his career.

546,kazawolf,Hitch's very best movie,10,28 April 2009,"I concur with those who consider North by Northwest Hitch's best movie. Yes, I love Psycho and Vertigo and the others as well, but N x NW has more dimensions and more intrigue and better pacing than any of his other movies.I've read a few comments here that seem to imply that N x NW is lacking in depth or missing some kind of transcendent meaning. It's only ""entertainment."" That seems unfair. If you want introspection or soul-searching, rent an Ingmar Bergman for heaven's sake! Hitch was always the master of surfaces, the perfect artifice. When an actor once asked ""What is my motivation in this scene?"" Hitch replied, ""your salary."" He had no use for heavy-handed meanings and morals, even in his dark fables.Still, N x NW is full of them if you look. The shallow ad-man discovers he's actually an intrepid hero. Truth be told, he's as world-wise as he is world-weary. Can you imagine forgiving and even pursuing a lover who has lied to you so she can send you off to be killed? Who seduced you ""just following orders?"" How romantic is that? He eventually realizes he's caught in a terrible game of moral relativity, with everyone out for themselves or their cause, so he might as well join them. It's in the forest reunion, after the fake shooting, where he pronounces judgment on it all: ""If you fellows can't lick the Vandamms of this world without asking girls like her to bed down with them and fly away with them and probably never come back alive, maybe you better start learning to lose a few cold wars!"" So Thornhill is a mensch after all. Who knew?That's why the earlier scene in Washington at the CIA building is so important, and, contrary to some opinions, needs to be there. That's where you first realize how ruthless the whole Cold War game is. ""We do.nothing,"" the Professor pronounces, about Thornhill's predicament. ""C'est la guerre,"" one of them intones ironically. ""Goodbye, Mr. Thornhill, wherever you are,"" says the last. It doesn't ruin the movie for us to discover that Kaplan doesn't exist. We had about 40 minutes of uncertainty. Now it's onto some other intrigue. Hitch gives us plenty. It was a favorite Hitchcock ploy to let the viewer in on a secret that the protagonist didn't know. From that point on, the viewer is subconsciously willing that inside information to him or her, and wondering when and how they will discover it.There are so many ironies in N x NW it's hard to list them all. Maybe the greatest is Vandamm. He seems like the epitome of cool and control and sophistication. Yet he's constantly miscalculating! First he nabs the wrong guy, then he fails to kill him on at least three occasions, in part because of a kinky predilection for exotic homicide like crop-dusting biplanes and drunken convertible driving, (and knife-throwers, if you believe as I do that Vandamm's thug Valerian was actually aiming for ""Kaplan"" and missed). How this guy got to the top of his game is a true mystery.But Vandamm's biggest screw-up is loaning out his girlfriend for the night on the train. She's obviously long over him and eager to move on, whether she knows it or not. And Vandamm's even met the intriguing, resourceful hunk he's turning her over to! And he's not worried? Talk about arrogance and vanity! So he loses Eve as well. Still, once Leonard informs on her, he could save his own butt if he just ""disposed"" of her in some normal Mafioso kind of way—like a bullet or something—but instead he has to fantasize about throwing her out of the plane over the ocean. That gives our hero the extra five minutes he needs to save her. One more irony.So think of Vandamm's dénouement: there he is, this suave foreign agent whose gig is undermining our government, busted atop the very icon of Americana, Mt. Rushmore, all his thugs dead, his mistress in love with someone else, and now probably about to be put away for life (and maybe even executed in those paranoid 1950's times), when just a few moments before he was happily sipping champagne in his ultra-modern Frank Lloyd Wright mountain retreat. Talk about reversal of fortune!At least he still has the panache to quip a final one-liner, as his ""right arm"" Leonard hurtles over a cliff. ""That wasn't very sporting, using real bullets.""Ernest Lehman's brilliant script and convoluted plot makes this movie one I can watch again and again. The acting is superb and nuanced, all the way down to the minor characters. And I haven't even mentioned Bernard Herrmann's masterful score. Another post!",North by Northwest
547,jay-allen792,A Great Movie,9,11 December 2011,"North By Northwest is a 1959 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason. It is widely considered a landmark in imagery and suspense, which had never before been done on such a scale as in this film.The theme of the movie is mistaken identity. The movie is about an advertising executive named Roger Thornhill, played by Grant, who is kidnapped at a restaurant when he leaves his table to try to make a phone call. He has no idea why the men grab him, but he is thrown in a car and driven to a mansion owned by the Townsend family, the head of which works at the United Nations. A man who he assumes is Townsend (James Mason) interrogates him there, and accuses him to be a US spy named George Kaplan. This series of events catches an unwilling Thornhill up in the events of the Cold War. He tries to solve the mystery of who Kaplan really is, and later uncover the true identity of the man who had him kidnapped. Along the way he meets Eve Kendall, (Eva Marie Saint) who is also not what she seems.The theme of the film really works well when one considers the time in which it was made. It was created during the fearful Cold War between the United States and Russia, where ""Red Scare"" suspicion ran rampant. The movie plays on these fears through its use of mistaken identity throughout. The villain is not who he says he is, and he thinks Thornhill, the protagonist, is someone else. This creates an environment of paranoia and distrust; where anyone can be an enemy threatening not only your life, but the way of life in the entire nation you live in. The motif of suspicion is the purveying feeling throughout. The suspense created in the movie was very real for people living in the United States at the time, which only bolstered the film's success.Color is used in the movie in a surprisingly ""normal"" way. The movie takes place mostly in the daytime, with the outdoor scenes using the natural lighting from the sun, and the indoor scenes doing the same, often with large windows. The climactic scenes take place at night however, both in a mansion and on the face of Mount Rushmore. It's strange how once the revelations are made in the film, the climax takes place in darkness. This lack of light seems to play on the themes of mistaken identity by almost hiding the characters whose identities the audience has discovered. I really enjoyed this movie, and had not seen it prior to viewing it for HUMN 246. Even though I am a fan of old movies, I was surprised at how it kept my attention throughout, even though most of the film involves Grant's character running around and trying to figure out what's going on. I compare it to The Bourne Identity because it deals with mistaken identity and trying to figure out who all the players in the plot are.",North by Northwest

The only problem I have with this film is the abrupt ending, thinking it would be climatic it changes to a completely different location and it ruins the suspense for me.

554,wal01,Action-Packed Thriller and Comedy,10,10 December 2011,"The theme of North by Northwest is one of deception and mistaken identity. This film is an action packed thriller with comedy mixed in. Everyone was acting out a character and no one is who they seemed to be. The main character Roger Thornhill was mistaken as a spy for the US Government at the Plaza Hotel in New York by foreign spies. Later in the film he pretends to be a spy to protect a woman that he had fallen in love with Eve, who was a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency. Eve was pretending to be interested in Roger Thornhill and the foreign spy Phillp Vandamm. This kept the viewer in suspense until the end when it is revealed that she was playing both sides in order to protect her identity while trying to protect US secrets. One element or motif is the reoccurring thematic element of deception. Everyone in the film is playing a part of someone else except Roger's mom. This deception is displayed by everyone in this film. This film keeps you guessing. The famous crop-dusting scene uses different camera angles along with dynamic sound effects that make this scene very exciting and suspenseful. This scene reinforces the theme. The elements of this story unify the plot and make this a credible interesting movie. Although this North by Northwest is suspenseful, it is also simple and easy to follow. North by Northwest has a chronological structure. It starts with the characters introduced in New York. It is followed by the complication or conflict of the mistaken identity and deception of all the characters while ending in the Climax. The climax occurred when all the true identities are identified and the reason for all of the deception is explained. This was when the foreign spies dropped the art object and microfilm containing Government secrets were exposed. The characterization of the film was through external action. The motivations of the characters were revealed throughout the film. Although there were not many symbols in the film, the irony was displayed with by the suspense and periodic humor from the characters of this film. The theme is repeated until the end of the film. Towards the end of the film Roger Thornhill said to the Phillip Vandamm, ""The only performance that will satisfy you is when I play dead.""

First is the chase by a crop dusting plane really shouldn't work. I mean it is big and noisy. Couldn't it be outrun? But Mr Hitchcock makes it electrifying. Second is the ending.

Thornhill completely fails to wonder how on earth this completely unknown miss Kendall is able to know and even make contacts with the mysterious George Kaplan.There is nothing impressive about most of the camera work either. Apart from an extremely elegant pan from outside to inside the train, most scenes are quite ordinary.This movie is for film buffs and others who prefer hidden references to other events above the actual story.

557,carmean03,"As entertaining as it gets!! Funny, suspenseful and romantic.",9,16 September 2012,"Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest"" is a pleasant deviation from modern day films, yet can still deliver powerful suspense and larger than life special effects. Set in 1959 (present day), New York City, Roger Thornhill (Carey Grant) is a busy, quick-witted advertising executive. After he is abducted by spies who have mistaken him for federal agent 'George Kaplan"", Thornhill goes on the run to find the real 'Kaplan"". While on the run, 'Thornhill' meets a beautiful woman, Eve, (Eva Marie Saint) who takes it upon herself to keep him out of trouble, but isn't at all what she seems to be. It isn't until later Roger O. (""means nothing"") Thornhill, realizes not only is 'Kaplan' a fictitious person made up by the FBI as a ploy, but Eve is deeply involved in his abduction and the man trying to kill him, Phillip Vandamm, played by James Mason. Because Vandamm is the target for the feds creation of 'Kaplan', he still believes this to be Thornhill and continues his efforts in killing him. After many tribulations and much confusion over Eve's identity, Thornhill finally learns of her undercover mission with the feds. Because it means death for Eve if Vandamm finds out his ""girlfriend"" is an informant for the FBI, Thornhill does everything he can to keep her safe. Eventually evading the spies after an adventure on top of Mt. Rushmore, Roger (Thornhill) and Eve rendezvous to the place they first met, a train car heading back to New York.As the ""Master of Suspense"", Alfred Hitchcock has outdone himself by creating another ""Mistaken Identity"" film (among at least 3 others of his biggest films) that has somehow managed to set itself apart from the rest. The hilarious wit of Roger Thornhill parallels with Hitchcocks own dry, but extremely good sense of humor. I found this film not only obviously suspenseful and entertaining, but much funnier than I ever expected it to be.Directorial Technique:Alfred Hitchcock, uses the scene transitions and cutting as a tool to control the tempo of the film. Through the majority of the film; a long, continuous shot is employed to create drama. Panning the camera to follow or find the subject to be focused on (specific character/s) created an attention demanding effect, and the fixed long shot allows the viewer to see what's going on in the background as well. Hitchcock likes the viewer to be stimulated even in less suspenseful scenes.The loudest and most deserving sound effect in my opinion is the Prop plan noises in the desert bus stop scene. In the distance a plane is heard but barely seen, as it gets closer, it gets louder, and louder. At one point I had to turn the volume on my TV down because it was giving me anxiety. It's THAT loud- almost like it's right outside. Not only is it loud, but as the plane flies around and comes back the volume increases and decreases creating a vibrating rhythm than can almost be felt through the television.I noticed towards the end of the film just how impressive Hitchcock's ability is to play the viewer's heart rate like an instrument...I just read a quote from Alfred himself that states ""You know, were not making a movie. We're constructing an organ...the kind of organ you see in a theatre. And we press this chord and now the audience laughs, we press that chord and they gasp, and we press these notes and they chuckle. Someday we won't have to make a movie, well just attach them to electrodes and play the various emotions for them to experience in the theatre"".",North by Northwest

Cary Grant was never better. And Alfred Hitchcock, some of whose work made me wonder why he was so celebrated, truly got it right in this movie. Some of the more memorable scenes: Cary Grant creeping along a ledge, high above street level, and slipping through an open window into a sleeping woman's hotel room. ""Stop!"" she cries out when she sees someone coming through the window. Then, as Grant hurries through the room toward the door, glancing at her and apologizing, she more entreats than commands, ""Stop!""

When one gets to see With North by Northwest, sets and does not stop. Because, unlike other films of the teacher, this starts at 2 minutes. And it's something as absurd as a mistake. The McGuffin elevated to masterpiece.As I said, based on the most absurd of all, an error in a phone call, Hitch builds a kind of parody spy film, based on one mistake after another, from one absurd fact followed by another fact even absurd. But the success of this film is not taking itself seriously. It is still a very great Hitchcock joke, a tease the viewer. Probably, if the great script by Ernie Lehmann had fallen into other hands, would have ended up as a mere spy movie, with good and bad clearly differentiated. but with the teacher becomes a comedy that borders on pure moments of surrealism, like the fact that Cary Grant's mother was only 10 months older than him, or the drunken scene at the police station or the auction are pure anthology surrealism and absurdity free. But none like the plane. With nothing to fumigate, Hitchcock gives us a plane in the middle of nowhere, the most absurd of killing someone, and get it is great, because another director would have made us stupid with this free sundries the image.With a prodigious Cary Grant, James Mason and has become the iconic bad Hitchcock movie, and Eve Marie Saint, who despite being less Hitchcock girl all his movies in the '50s, was never more seductive than here, Alfred Hitchcock once again proved that he is a master in the casting, and then replacing some of their concerns at stake, as the false mother guilty or somewhat peculiar, again proved he was the greatest coach in history. Each of his films has a unique touch that gave him both in the staging, as in the soundtrack, the main theme as indicated by where they air the shots, and of course, with Bass credits, which then would be exceeded in Psycho.",North by Northwest
560,christopherdtaylor1994,Dated - definitely dated (and descends into ridiculousness),5,25 August 2019,"Look, I understand this is a classic. I get it. And in the 1950s/1960s I'm sure it was great but my goodness it's hard to watch now and as much as I appreciate Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock, it's just really not that ""good"".My wife even said ""it's definitely the worst Hitchcock movie I've seen.""Stupid people should face consequences for being stupid and doing stupid things and yet this movie gets a pass for that exact situation.It boggles the mind that people watch this and consider it some sort of Hitchcockian master work.Spoiler Alert:The idea that our protaganonist somehow hooks up with a female antagonist randomly on a train is 50-60s movie plot making at it's worst.Watch this for the nostalgia but be prepared to be diappointed by it's lack of intelligence and sheer ridiculousness.",North by Northwest
561,bjdnycla,Hitchcock's best?,10,2 March 2005,"Most folks here rate Vertigo and Rear Window higher, but i always come back to this one. For sheer entertainment, i love North by Northwest and the 39 Steps. Maybe because Hitchcock's sense of humor is so evident, keeping the pace off-balance and relieving the anxiety every so often? Somehow i don't think Hitchcock found much humor or comedy resident in Jimmy Stewart, but he saw it and expertly tapped into it in Cary Grant--Archie Leach--Roger Thornhill. Maybe because they were both Brits? This is one of the few movies i was overwhelmed by as a kid and found even more fascinating as an adult. I don't know much about the life of Alfred Hitchcock, but it does seem to me that his view of human nature darkened later on --i am thinking of Psycho and the Birds as two obvious examples--and we gradually see much less of this sort of sly, almost parody of Hollywood's portrayals, in this case of the successful New Yorker about town. Hitch is also playing with us -- laughing at American sexual stereotypes, as he first profiles Thornhill as an aging mama's boy (fussing at his secretary, preoccupied with his mother while at the Oak Bar with his advertising buddies, using up his only phone call at the police station to call her), setting us up --so that we are somewhat taken aback when he starts pursuing Eva Marie Saint. My few disappointments with this film are that James Mason is rather under-utilized and one-dimensional, and that the last few scenes seem rushed so that one moment we are atop Mt. Rushmore and the next the film is over. But still....",North by Northwest
562,raymoloney666,amazing,10,10 December 2013,"i don't watch older films as much i should but this ranks easily in my all time top 10... highly recommended! I've recently watched a few of alfred hitchcock films but none so far still don't come as close to this in terms of acting and story. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a fussy advertising executive. He is then kidnapped by Philip Vandamm (James Mason), a foreign spy who has mistaken him for George Kaplan, a government agent. When Thornhill tries to make sense of the case, Vandamm and his men frame him for murder. Roger is then on the run from both the government and foreign agents as he travels across the country. He is helped along the way by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie-Saint), a mysterious blonde, but she may not be as innocent as she seems.",North by Northwest
563,i_rule07,"wow, i cannot believe how much i hated this movie....",2,4 February 2007,"before i begin, i will say that i understood every part of this movie. I had to study it for film class.Secondly, i've seen many BAD movies, especially in Bollywood, and those movies happened to be VERY similar.This movie cannot be any cornier. With each stupid plot point and the bad acting, the movie only has a name because Hitcock made it. If Hitchock did not exist, and if anyone else made this movie, making an identical copy, the movie would fail. The movie cannot maintain its position alone, it needs Hitcock.Movies considered the best of all time must be able to compete with those from anytime, past or future. Therefore, technology, color, and anything you can think of that has acted as a disadvantage towards Hitchcock because of time period does not matter, because these elements are not needed to make a great film--such as On the Waterfront. great film, made during the same time period.PLENTY of films made today are SIGNIFICANTLY better, yet are underrated because their directors do not have a name that compares to Scorsacce, Speilburg, or Kubrick. North By Northwest alone would be one of the forgotten movies of its decade, except the world is filled with Hitchcock fanatics",North by Northwest
564,danielhodgettsdh,Underwhelming...,5,14 October 2019,"This film must be one of the most overrated films ever! The plot is dull, the character development is lousy and its not just the age, it hasn't actually aged that badly and the production is fair to good even by today's standards.. I really do think it's peoples love for Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock that make the film so popular..",North by Northwest
565,toricatton-93773,Good just good,7,14 April 2018,"This one was good! I liked it a lot and it has a ton of charm. However, I feel like its reputation made me not like it quite as much. But that tends to happen with classics for me.",North by Northwest
566,phiya-1,Great Music,10,12 December 2005,"This is a great movie and while the direction, locations, acting and editing are fun they are second to one of the best film scores in movie history. Bernard Hermann is a musical master and genius and there has not been anyone before or since that compares to his consistent creativity and this is one of his best. Listen to the music from the first opening credits to the scene on the streets and you will hear some of the best compositions since Stravinsky and Beethoven. (He also did ""Psycho"", ""Twilight Zone"" and so many other fabulous scores.) You may think that John Williams music is great, and he is, including all the latest Harry Potter films, but the only thing that he did that comes close to Bernard Hermann is his music for ET, the motor cycle chase in Indiana Jones III, Duel of the Fates and the Droid battle in Star Wars I. Hans Zimmerman, another great film scorer, has tremndous creativity, often more than John Williams, but anything he did and, for that matter, anyone else to date, has never been better than Bernard Hermann; and this movie is one of his best. An essential ingredient to every great movie is an even better musical score and this one of the best examples of this. Musically, previous to Bernard Hermann was Max Steiner, who wrote the score for ""Gone With The Wind"", and before him was the most creative genius in all of film history, Charles Chaplin (who wrote, directed, acted, and scored all of his films! An unheard of feat these days!). See this movie but also listen to the music and you will hear one the best scores of all time.",North by Northwest
