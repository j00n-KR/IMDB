0,SnoopyStyle,run-on sentence of a gangster movie,5,8 June 2015,"FBI Deputy Director Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia), agents Richard Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Donald Carruthers (Ray Liotta) are using Las Vegas magician wannabe gangster Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) to bring down the last mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). Sparazza has issued a $1 million bounty on Israel. This brings in contract killers Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan), Sharice Watters (Taraji P. Henson) and Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys), Pasquale Acosta (Nestor Carbonell), and neo-Nazis Darwin (Chris Pine), Jeeves (Kevin Durand) and Lester (Maury Sterling). Bail bondsmen Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck), Pete Deeks (Peter Berg) and Hollis Elmore (Martin Henderson) hired by sleazy lawyer Rip Reed (Jason Bateman) who wants him back.This is a massive mess of crazy characters in a stylized gangster movie. It's nearly impossible to connect with any of the characters. The writing is all style and nothing too sharp. There are some crazy fun action as long as one can maintain attention long enough to see them.",Smokin' Aces
1,boblipton,Do People Actually Like This?,6,14 August 2020,"It's a typically muddled Joe Carnahan movie in which people are freely shot with what the film maker imagines is great style.A Vegas entertainer is working with the FBI to bring down the last of the Mafia mob bosses, but it's by no means a straightforward story, except for the large amount of stage blood that is spattered around. There's no real character to any of the characters, just a convoluted conspiracy amidst large amounts of bloodshed and shattered glass in a Vegas hotel.",Smokin' Aces
2,nogodnomasters,YOU WANT OF PIECE OF THIS?,10,2 June 2019,"In this film a contract is but out on ""Buddy"" Israel (Jeremy Piven). All the big hitmen are involved. The movie introduces them all to us except for ""The Swede"" who remains a mystery. Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds play FBI men assigned to protect Buddy. Buddy is the ""white whale of snitches."" He is also an illusionist, so immediately you wonder how that will factor into the film. Going after Buddy is not going to be easy. It will be like going after ""Fort Knox with a slingshot.""The humor is hidden and moves quickly. Ryan Reynolds talks about plastic surgery of a mobster to Ray Liotta and says ""Every has-been in Hollywood hasn't had this much surgery."" Liotta has been suspected of having a lot of work done, but denies it. I like the way the scenes blend into each other. For instance, two people will shake hands to seal a deal, this then moves into a scene with two people shaking hands greeting each other. The lawyer trying to act hip was funny. In order to get the million dollar bounty, the hitmen will also eliminate their competition. Buddy is held on a secret hotel floor and everyone knows where it is located.Good action/comedy. Quirky characters. Plot that moves quickly. The sequel is better. Major plot twist at the end, but who cares?F-bomb, nudity, no sex.",Smokin' Aces
3,kosmasp,Die Hard,7,27 March 2007,"I don't know where to begin with the movie, so first will explain the summary title I chose! :o) That has nothing to do with the movie Die Hard. If you've seen Smokin Aces, than you surely must have noticed, that some characters don't die off that easily ... Most of them actually, Die Hard ... Some of them might not die at all .. but that's another story! The movie starts off with introduction to the main characters. Some of them are introduced with a voice over, others just with their name and (former) job title. Ben Afflecks group is the first to get hit and it happens quick! Which is exactly how the movie is supposed to be like.You have one liners and some explicit violence (blood all over the place), which is something that one should expect. Nothing for the faint of heart then, but for everyone else with a taste for ... action!",Smokin' Aces
4,jboothmillard,Smokin' Aces,2,24 July 2011,"I will admit I did not pay full attention to this while it was on, and the only reason I've given it an extra star is because of the good amount of violence, from director John Carnahan (The A-Team). Basically Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin) is the head of the mob, and has taken out a contract on sleazy magician Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven) who is testifying against the gangs of Las Vegas in court. This is actually some sort of small con by the FBI to bring down Sparazza and the mob, and at Aces' Lake Tahoe hideout, Agents Richard Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Donald Carruthers (Ray Liotta), have been assigned and dispatched to keep an eye on him as protection. The price on Aces' head spreads around from word of mouth, and soon enough many ex-cons, cons-to-be, bounty hunters, thugs-for-hire, deadly vixens and double-crossing mobsters are joining the hunt. These people wanting the reward include master of disguise Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan), hit women Sharice Watters (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's Taraji P. Henson) and Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys), and the psychotic neo-Nazi Tremor brothers Jeeves (Kevin Durand), Darwin Tremor (Unstoppable's Chris Pine) and Lester (Maury Sterling). Getting involved in the plot as well are FBI director Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia), Aces has his second-in-command Sir Ivy (Common), bail bondsman Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) and his partners 'Pistol' Pete Deeks (Peter Berg) and Hollis Elmore (Martin Henderson), and Sparazza's under boss Pasquale Acosta (Nestor Carbonell), it is all becoming a big chase for the jackpot. Also starring Jason Bateman as Rupert 'Rip' Reed, Matthew Fox as Bill Security Super and Licence to Kill's Wayne Newton. I liked that it had so many recognisable faces in it, I liked as I said the high amount of inventive violence, and the explosions and stuff were reasonably exciting in moments, but the story was all over the place, and even though I didn't watch properly I got the feeling it didn't matter, not that good a black comedy action drama. Pretty poor!",Smokin' Aces
5,Tweekums,Action and violence as just about everybody go after Buddy 'Aces' Israel,7,23 May 2017,"Buddy 'Aces' Israel is a Las Vegas magician who had become a little too close to the Mafia; at first he just enjoyed hanging out with mobsters then he wanted to become one and finally he has a choice; go to jail or inform on the mob in particular Primo Sparazza the brutal leader of the Las Vegas Mob. Soon there is a million dollar bounty on his head and a variety of hit men (and women), bounty hunters and the FBI are converging on his penthouse apartment in a Lake Tahoe hotel. When they get there all hell will break loose.For the most part this is a fairly routine action film; it starts well with the explanation of the main plot and introduction of the numerous people we assume will be the main characters. A few of them don't really last long enough to be considered main characters though. They are a varied bunch; a pair of FBI agents who think taking Buddy into custody should be a relatively routine assignment; a pair of female assassins; a trio of somewhat insane killers; a few independent killers; a group of bounty hunters; Buddy and his entourage and mention of the mysterious 'Swede'. During these introductions we see flashbacks of some of their previous work. Once the action in Tahoe gets started it is quickly turned up to eleven and it is anybody's guess which of our protagonists will survive. The cast includes plenty of familiar names including; Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds they all do a decent enough jobs although for me the most memorable characters were played by singer Alicia Keys, on her acting debut, and Taraji P. Henson as the hitwomen Georgia Sykes and Sharice Watters this may have been aided by the fact that the latter's weapon of choice was a massive fifty calibre rifle! As the film reaches its end there is a twist that is a bit unnecessary but wasn't enough to detract from the film. It must be noted that this film isn't for the squeamish as there is a lot of bloody mayhem which is often brutal rather than just over-the-top. Overall though I'd recommend this to anybody wanting action, a degree of comedy and isn't easily offended.",Smokin' Aces
6,BA_Harrison,Tries just a bit too hard...,6,29 September 2016,"I like the basic premise for Smokin' Aces—hired killers competing to collect the $1m placed on the head of a mafia snitch. I like the cast, which features a raft of impressive names. And I appreciate the occasionally anarchic approach, the film throwing in random 'WTF?' scenes and going into cartoonish, hyperviolent overdrive for its action.What I didn't like was the very uneven pacing throughout, the overly complex plot which introduces way too many characters, and the unnecessary twist ending of the kind that might have seemed fresh the previous decade (when The Usual Suspects, Seven, Fight Club and The Sixth Sense pulled the rug from under the viewer's feet), but which soon became annoyingly trite.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for the karate Ritalin kid with the boner, who is so freakin' bizarre that I couldn't help but laugh.",Smokin' Aces
7,edwagreen,Smokin' Aces Should Burn Up. 0*,1,8 July 2007,"Positively an awful movie dealing with a plot that is revealed with about 10 minutes or less to go in this terrible, miserable, outrageous film.You know that a picture is in trouble when Ben Affleck is shot to death in the first half hour of the film. At that point, the studio should have shut this entire mess down.Jeremy Piven is given the thankless role of a comedian type mobster who is soon wanted by the mob.The film is outrageously violent and the shoot up scene in the hotel smacks of nothing else but pure disgust.How dare the makers of this garbage call this a form of entertainment.What kind of nonsense are we led to believe in at the film's end? The FBI allowed this massacre to take place so that the Piven character could participate in a heart surgery to save his father, the latter being someone who was out to get him throughout the film. The film never explains the various groups caught up in that hotel shootout. The bodies pile up and I was disgusted by this way too violent film. Some sort of code is needed to get this junk off the screen.",Smokin' Aces

9,Theo Robertson,Part Tarantino . Part Ritchie . All Crap,2,3 November 2007,"It's said that if you want to make a great film then keep the premise simple and SMOKIN' ACES has a relatively simple premise of the mob putting a million dollar contract on potential star witness Buddy "" Aces "" Israel and rival gangs of hit men trying to eliminate both Aces and each other to get their hands on the money . I'm sure we all agree that this is a fairly simple and effective idea for a film . Alas what can often happen is that a writer or a producer can throw a massive spanner in the works by making everything too over complicated This is certainly the problem with this movie . It confuses the audience as to where it's going , has totally ill thought out plotting and totally underdeveloped characters . There's too many characters which means we spend the first twenty minutes of SMOKIN' ACES being introduced to them in a very lazy manner with captions . THE DEPARTED has perhaps too many characters but at no point do we see captions saying "" Mob rat "" or "" FBI informer or "" Undercover cop "" letting the audience know who these characters are , probably because it's revealed in the narrative what their function is , as SMOKIN' ACES continues you start to realise that there's no cohesive story save for the central premise . What makes it so annoying is that many of the characters are written out of the film between 30 and 60 minutes of its running leaving the audience pondering why they were included in the first place . One character seems to be merely included to set up a "" hilarious "" scene with a hyperactive kid at some point in the movie . The more SMOKIN' ACES continues the more you realise what an incohesive mess the screenplay is Writer / director Joe Carnahan is more interested in incident rather than narrative which while not exactly making him an auteur could be forgiven if the incidents were well done but they're not and Carnahan seems to suffer amnesia . For example we're told about an international hit-man who is so ruthless he bites off his own fingertips in order to stop himself being identified . Do you get it ? Fingerprints can get you identified by law enforcement agencies and a good hit-man will do absolutely anything to stop themselves being identified or linked to their crimes by the law . Strange that a couple of scenes later we see possibly he world's greatest hired killer carrying out a hit where he leaves a wheelchair , mask , and weapons at the scene of the crime . I'f he's such a great assassin then why would he leave all that forensic evidence lying about ? If the screenplay owes a lot to Tarantino then the directing owes a lot to Guy Ritchie . We see lots of camera tricks , freeze frame etc but at least Ritchie is able to make a consistent film with a complicated plot . Like the screenplay the directing is often an uneven mess and can be summed in the last ten minutes which has an entirely different mood to the rest of the film . And don't be fooled that this may be a good film to rent due to the "" big name "" cast . Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta haven't had a big hit for years and SMOKIN' ACES ensures they'll be stuck in straight to DVD obscurity for a lot longer yet . SMOKIN ACES also heralds the death knell of Ben Affleck as an actor since he shows us what he does worst - Playing tough blue collar Irish Americans . I'm not sure how his directing career will go but anything that keeps him away from being in front of a camera will be a blessing . And I doubt if even he could direct a film as dire as SMOKIN' ACES",Smokin' Aces
10,Hey_Sweden,A fun way to kill 109 minutes.,8,23 May 2020,"Buddy Israel (Jeremy Piven) is a prominent Las Vegas entertainer who had been attracted to the criminal lifestyle and begun hanging out with the mob. Now, he's set to testify against them, and they are FURIOUS. A whopping one million price tag is put on Buddy's head, motivating a non-stop rogues' gallery of homicidal types to try to cash in on that reward.It's all about style and visceral effect in this hilariously trashy, over the top story, with a lot of attention paid to exposition and setting up characters in the early parts. Writer / director Joe Carnahan is clearly having a ball with this darkly comic ballet of bloodshed, and with the help of a solid cast, he created some truly interesting characters, some of them supposedly expert assassins. (The Tremors brothers are the most outrageous of the entire bunch.)Buddy is the kind of guy whom the audience will WANT to see meet his maker, so it becomes a real hoot as individuals keep adding to the body count as they aggressively compete with each other.Interestingly enough, the action fades in the stretch, with a quieted-down wrap-up devoted to laying some twists on the viewer, and they are real doozies. The whole thing pretty much amounts to nonsense, but when the nonsense is THIS lively and this nasty, it still manages to be entertaining.The cast is absolutely packed with name actors (Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Ryan Reynolds (who gives one of his better performances here), Ray Liotta, Jason Bateman), music stars (Common and Alicia Keys), and various other very familiar faces (David Proval, Alex Rocco, Peter Berg, Chris Pine, Curtis Armstrong, etc.). In cameo roles you'll see Wayne Newton (as himself) and Matthew Fox (initially unrecognizable as an incompetent security chief).It's not surprising that this was always intended to basically be a comedy; one can have some real fun with it if they don't take it seriously.But that one kid? He's got to be one of the most annoying kids that this viewer has EVER seen in a motion picture.Eight out of 10.",Smokin' Aces
11,poolandrews,I can see why some may like it but I didn't think it was anything more than average.,5,10 July 2010,"Smokin' Aces starts as mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin) puts a hit out on Las Vegas magician turned state informant Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven) with instructions to cut out & return his heart. FBI agent Donald Carruthers (Ray Liotta) & his partner Richard Messner (Ryan Reynolds) are assigned to go to Lake Taho where Israel is hiding in the penthouse of the Newton Hotel, the race is on between various freelance assassins seeking the one million payout, bondsman Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) after Israel for a skipped bond reward & the FBI as to who gets to Israel first. As people die it becomes clear to agent Messner that there is much more going on than a simple witness protection case...This American, British & French co-production was directed by Joe Carnahan & to me is a British gangster flick wannabe, Smokin' Aces felt like an attempt to make a Guy Ritchie flick the US & while it's not a complete loss I must admit I didn't like it as much as many seem to. I found the script unnecessarily complicated, not complicated because I couldn't follow or understand it but complicated because at heart Smokin' Aces is a pretty simple film. A guy named Buddy 'Aces' Israel who has mixed with the wrong people wants to turn witness for the FBI & as such it's straight race between the good guy's & bad guy's to who gets to him first, that's really all there is too it & the numerous subplots & character's just slow things down & get in the way. I wouldn't mind so much if Smokin' Aces had the humour & twist's of a Guy Ritchie flick but they don't, in fact I was quite surprised at how serious Smokin' Aces takes itself. The amount of character's is another problem, there are too many & there are too many unlikable ones particularly that awful black woman with the sniper rifle. There's a lot of early exposition that bogs the film down & it's not always clear who or what is being spoken about, the twist ending isn't that great with a rather lame surprise & like the FBI & hospital would leave those two alone in a room together unguarded. At over an hour & forty minutes Smokin' Aces is quite long with only one big action scene & even that is just a shoot-out, the dialogue isn't as sharp or cool or referential or quotable as say a Quinten Tarintino or Guy Ritchie gangster flick (you know the ones I mean) & I simply didn't care for anyone or anything on screen at any time.There are a few really silly over the top scenes & character's like the three Tremor brother's who surely wouldn't be that hard to track down & find if you were the police? The scene inside the house with the kid & Granny are also silly & feel out of place. The attitude of just about every character here towards everyone else is sheer callousness, even Agent Messner when all those FBI guy's get shot the only one he seem bothered about & tries to save is his partner. There's no soul or heart in Smokin' Aces & I found it hard to like & therefore care about anyone. Surprisingly short on action there's one big shoot-out otherwise it's fairly low key stuff & the film relies more on it's over complicated plot. As an action film there's not enough here & as a thriller it ties itself up in knots.With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 this was actually filmed in Lake Tahoe & Las Vegas. It looks nice enough the who feel of the film again tries to duplicate a Guy Ritchie flick with speed-ups, slow motions, frame skipping, split screen, people talking over other scenes, flashback revelations, impossible camera movements & the whole filming style just screams British gangster thriller. There's a decent cast here with singers Alicia Keys & Common making their acting debuts.Smokin' Aces is a film I didn't like that much, sure it tells a story & it has a bit of style but it doesn't add up to much & the lack of action & dialogue heavy exposition slow it down too much too often. Followed by the direct to video sequel Smokin' Aces 2: Assassins' Ball (2010) which I have yet to see.",Smokin' Aces
12,dbborroughs,Funny first half clashes with violent second as various good guys and bad guys all try to get their hands on Buddy Israel,5,10 February 2007,"Confused mess of a film is at times wickedly funny and unremittingly violent, two halves of very different movies that never come together. Adding to the films problems is a plot line so crammed with characters and so piled with plot lines that everything over shadows the main thrust of the story.The plot line has Vegas showman turned mafia wannabe Buddy Israel getting arrested by the Feds. Getting out on bail Israel runs to Lake Tahoe and holds up in the penthouse of a casino. The FBI knowing that a sick mafia don has an interest in the escaped show man watches his house and finds out that a hit has been put on the fugitive. As hit teams, bail bondsman and assorted other characters descend on Tahoe Israel begins to break apart.I could explain more but I don't understand enough of what I left out to be certain that I'd be getting it right. The first half of this film is very funny as all of the characters are introduced and are found to be an amusing, but deadly lot. From the three neo-Nazi brothers to the lesbian duo to the bail bonds men everyone has a story and a skewed way of looking at things. Everyone provides enough material to be the lead of their very own two hour action flick, unfortunately there are a lot of them and this movie only runs around 100 minutes. The second half, of this film is a really nasty action film that has the assassins all attempt to get to their target, while the police and the FBI try to figure out whats going on and to remove Israel from harm. Its an odd jarring shift that leaves you slack jawed as one of the nastiest films of recent memory unspools before your eyes. It doesn't help that amidst the carnage there are shifts back to the smart mouthed ways of the first half. I should also point out that the first half's pace is quite leisurely giving the impression that things will happen at a certain pace, however once the shooting starts things fly toward the end with logic, reason and plot points left twitching on the floor. (lets face it this film makes no real sense, or could only do so in a cut at least an hour longer. Even the big surprise revelation, foreshadowed though it maybe, seems to come out of left field just to provide a reason and ending to the film) The performances are really good across the board. Its clear everyone is having a good time and signed on for more than a pay check. Alicia Keys is fantastic and her section of the film is quite good and touching (Is there anything she can't do?). Actually everyone creates real characters that you care about. (The only one I don't get is Buddy Israel who remains a cypher, even after you know whats going on, he's a coke headed jerk and thats all he remains through out.) Its an odd almost film that might have been something with a better script or editing or something.",Smokin' Aces
13,zardoz-13,"Wham! Bam! Gun'Em Down, M'am!",8,20 May 2007,"Anybody that craves the sight of scantily-clad babes, blood splashed everywhere and bodies shot to shreds will drool over director Joe Carnahan's violent new serio-comic mobster melodrama ""Smokin' Aces,"" an erratically uneven but incredibly entertaining R-rated crime thriller that takes an abrupt left-turn from black comedy in the third act to self-conscious tragedy. Clearly, when Carnahan penned this overwrought, contemporary shoot'em up, he must have been inspired by Sergio Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" Tony Scott's ""True Romance,"" Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects,"" and Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels."" Carnahan's gritty often hilariously vulgar dialogue contains some of the most quotable lines since ""Pulp Fiction,"" with F-bombs scattered like fragmentation grenades throughout the action. Aside from smarmy comic Ryan Reynolds and Ben Affleck in a minor role, Carnahan's otherwise first-rate cast boasts Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta, Taraji P. Henson, Andy Garcia, young Zack Cumer, and newcomer vocalist Alicia Keys. The casting of Ryan Reynolds as a revengeful FBI agent is a major flaw and he nearly undermines everything in the third act with his lackluster performance. Although Reynolds is built primarily for comedy, he demonstrates that his range is not limited, and he looks believable as a trigger-happy Fed. Similarly, in a significantly smaller role, ""Pearl Harbor"" heartthrob Ben Affleck scores as a lowlife scumbag bail bondsman. FBI agents Donald Carruthers (Ray Liotta of ""Goodfellas"") and Richard Messner (Ryan Reynolds of ""Van Wilder"") are on a stakeout, keeping close tabs on the last of the big-time mafia bosses, elderly Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin of ""Prizzi's Honor""), as he lies ailing in bed in his luxurious mansion. Meanwhile, the Bureau is negotiating a once-in-a-lifetime deal with Las Vegas magician-turned-mobster Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven of ""P.C.U."") who knows enough about Primo's operation to destroy it. Initially, the FBI believes that the wiseguys in Primo's organization want to put a million dollar contract out on Buddy to silence him permanently. At the same time, a variety of hard-hitting executioners step up to compete for that million-dollar payday. Among them are two sexy African-American ladies Georgia Sykes (R&B vocalist Alicia Keys in her film debut) and Sharice Watters (Taraji Henson of ""Hustle & Flow""), the three insane neo-Nazi redneck Tremor brothers: Darwin (Chris Pine of ""Star Trek Into Darkness""), Jeeves (Kevin Durand of ""Real Steet"") and Lester (Maury Sterling of ""Hart's War""), a masochistic Latin hit-man masquerading as an FBI agent, Pasquale Acosta (Nestor Carbonell of ""The Dark Knight Rises""), and a deadly hit-man with a knack for disguises, Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan of ""Gladiator""). Everybody converges on the penthouse in a casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where Buddy has holed up with his bodyguards waiting on word from FBI Deputy Director Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia of ""Ocean's Eleven"") about his deal with them to inform on his mentor Sparazza who had embraced him like a son. Not surprisingly, all hell breaks loose when these gunsels collide with each other in several hyperactively staged shoot-outs that rival the intensity but not the duration of those in Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down."" Writer & director Joe Carnahan, known best for his first two American-made movies ""Blood, Guts, Bullets, and Octane"" (1998) and ""Narc"" (2002), knows his way around crime movies. The first half-hour of ""Smokin' Aces"" is brilliantly done with an abundance of exposition conveyed in minimal time that introduces all the characters and lays out the background of the conflict. Wisely, Carnahan juggles the exposition, spreading it among different characters so none of it becomes monotonous. His spontaneous, off-the-wall, earthy dialogue has an unmistakable underworld patois, while most of his casts— minus Reynolds and Affleck—have no trouble making this slangy stuff sound convincing in a repellent way. Furthermore, Carnahan has conjured up the most bizarre line-up of eight balls since Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch."" None of the characters in ""Smokin' Aces"" lack unique qualities. The best example is Warren (Zack Cumer of ""Necromentia""), a whacked out, motor-mouth teenager with ADD who forgets to take his Ritalin and practices his karate moves while behaving like an urban gangsta with a bad attitude. Cumer steals every scene that he is in for the brief period that he appears in the action. Carnahan gets a lot of mileage out of this colorful gallery of freakazoids. Several unsympathetic characters complicate the four-fisted action, and they get their just comeuppance by fade-out. Carnahan crams more plot into a nimble 108-minute movie than most could pull off in several. No matter how closely you pay attention to these convoluted shenanigans, including a backstory about an FBI effort to infiltrate the mob, will guess the major revelation before Carnahan unveils it in the third act.""Smokin' Aces"" emerges as an amoral, cartoon-like exercise in nihilism that the squeamish should shun but that fans of the crime capers will relish, particularly its interesting last-minute revelation about the object of all the hit men.",Smokin' Aces

Smokin' Aces was your annual star studded movie seeking to blow people away with names instead of actual content. Because hey... what's better than a movie about a single hit-man?? A movie about many hit men of course and they came from all corners of the earth. This movie was the many faces of the mercenary, and I think that's where the excitement and intrigue ended. The build up was rather nice and the shoot out was nice as well, but the ending left some to be desired. The movie tried to throw in a clever twist but it didn't have the ""gasp"" effect I think they wanted. Overall the movie was good; change the ending and it's a lot better.",Smokin' Aces
16,ferguson-6,3rd Rate Snatch,5,28 January 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. Evidently aimed at teenage boys who think pure violence is cool regardless of whether the story makes sense or is interesting, ""Smokin' Aces"" delivers very little other than violence. Writer/Director Joe Carnahan did a nice job a few years ago with ""Narc"", but aims above his talent here. Obviously influenced by the amazing ""Snatch"", Mr. Carnahan fails to deliver the snap, crackle and pop of Snatch dialogue. Instead we are treated to quite the body count and loads of strutting and posing.Jeremy Piven, in his never-ending pursuit of a leading man role, is literally wasted as the strung-out Vegas entertainer-cum-mobster who is attempting to save his own life by cutting a deal with the feds. Of course, the mob boss who he is going to testify against wants him dead and that's where the fun should begin. When word hits the street about the $1 million bounty on Piven's head and heart, all the ""professional"" hit men and women catch a ride to Lake Tahoe. After 90 minutes of shooting each other and the hotel, the back story that supposedly only the Feds know is revealed to any film goer who has never read a comic book.The supporting cast is interesting, although given little to work with. Fresh off his failed TV series, Ray Liotta is the veteran Federal agent partnered with the totally miscast Ryan Reynolds (Ryan Reynolds as an FBI agent ... whoever thought this was a good idea???). Ben Affleck has a brief role as a bail bondsman who is not up for the big time, rapper Common is very solid as one of Piven's guys, Andy Garcia is the ultra-secretive Fed in command of the operation, Alex Rocco is nothing but a voice on the phone and a shadow in the window, Curtis ""Booger"" Armstrong has a couple of nice scenes as Piven's agent and Matthew Fox looks like a cool guy trying to be a nerdy hotel security guy in glasses. The guy who flashes something here is Jason Bateman in what amounts to the little bit of humor flashed in the film.Very disappointing only because a little script work could have moved this one up a notch or two. There are some stylistic violent scenes, but mostly we are left watching a cheap card trick.",Smokin' Aces

Ryan Reynolds plays an F.B.I. officer who learns hard truths about Aces and his relation to an older mobster. It is a great serious performance from Reynolds who witnesses the dishonesty around him but his solution is questionable when he locks himself into a certain room. Alicia Keys is superb as a female hit-man posing as a prostitute to gain access to Isreal's suite. Ray Liotta plays Reynolds partner who enters the building with Reynolds yet meets tragedy. Andy Garcia is strong in key scenes when he arranges the whole assault then attempts to cover up guilty parties. Jeremy Piven plays Buddy ""Aces"", which is the Ace being smokin' out. The action is fast and fierce but the violence is extreme and too excessive. The film is well crafted and visually appealing for the genre. It regards the reality of one's evil deeds catching up and presenting its penalty. Score: 8 / 10",Smokin' Aces
18,FlashCallahan,The ho train has left the station...,4,7 January 2011,"Mob boss Primo Sparazza has taken out a hefty contract on Buddy ""Aces"" Israel - a sleazy magician who has agreed to turn state's evidence against the Vegas mob. The FBI, sensing a chance to use this small-time con to bring down big-target Sparazza, places Aces into protective custody-under the supervision of two agents dispatched to Aces' Lake Tahoe hideout. When word of the price on Aces' head spreads into the community of ex-cons and cons-to- be, it entices bounty hunters, thugs-for-hire, smoking' hot vixens and double-crossing mobsters to join in the hunt. With all eyes on Tahoe, this rogues' gallery collides in a comic race to hit the jackpot and rub out Aces....I was really looking forward to this movie, i mean it was directed by the guy who made the amazing Narc, and starred an impressive cast. And most of all, the trailer was a hoot and made it look like a treat.This is the sole reason why i don't trust trailers anymore. Sure the cast are good, and there are some good set pieces, but if there isn't a good story and script to hold it together, whats the point of it all.This is basically gun porn for the masses, and it ends up like watching a video game in progress. The groups in the film could be classed as a level in the game and we watch and wait to see how they progress. It's the same throughout the whole film, with a few 'clever' lines threw in, which are not very clever and add nothing to the film itself.Thank goodness for Piven, who actually raises this from actual trash and makes his few scenes a joy to watch.The rest of the film is pure piffle, and not very good.",Smokin' Aces
19,movieman_kev,Losing my faith,3,8 May 2007,"Joe Carnahan, the writer/director who showed such promise with Blood Guts Bullets and Octane. The guy who made a modern day classic with Narc. Threatens to destroy all the accolades heaped upon him by making the epitome of style over substance that's known as Smokin' Aces. The story dealing with numerous hit men and hit-women going after a million dollar contract on the head (or heart rather) of Buddy Israel (Jeremy Pivins from Entourage), has more plot holes in it than I can discuss in the 1,000 word cap that IMDb puts on reviews, and more brain numbing twists and turns than a rabid contortionist mid-orgasm. It tries in vain to be a zany, madcap, off the wall violent extravaganza but fails miserably. The a.d.d. kid could have been scraped in editing, as could the sight of Jason Bateman in womens' panties. The ending is one of the dumbest things i've ever seen as well. The MTV-generation that has such a short attention span that they won't remember the last sentence that I wrote (if they read it at all) might enjoy this movie, but too anyone else this is one to skip. I really hope that Joe rights himself with next year's ""Pride and Glory"", because I'm losing my faith a bit.My Grade: D+",Smokin' Aces
20,gradyharp,"Busy, Blustery, Noisy, and Overpopulated",5,26 April 2007,"Trying to keep track of the huge cast of characters, keeping their various allegiances to the plethora of participating assailants, requires a scorecard in the film SMOKIN' ACES. Writer/Director Joe Carnahan has style and the film's similarity to the many other cop/mob caper movies is evident, but Carnahan like to blitz the eye of the viewer with so much visual information (multiple tracks, quick scene flashes, unexplained flashbacks, etc) that when coupled with a soundtrack that is burdened with overlapping voices and very loud 'music' makes the story confusing.The last remnant of the Mafia lies in Las Vegas, and the FBI, various gangs, and detectives are out to either court the supposed willing informer, lounge comedian Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven), or kill him before he squeals his apparent vital information. Israel is hiding out in Tahoe in a penthouse papered with drugs, prostitutes, bodyguards, and pursing him are hired assassins, cops, FBI agents, and competing mobs. In the course of the film nearly everyone gets shot, tortured, killed, or maimed and the blood and set destruction are a primary ingredients. The large cast includes Ben Affleck (in a very quick role), Ryan Reynolds (who is actually the star), Andy Garcia, Jason Bateman, Alicia Keys, Ray Liotta, Peter Berg, Martin Henderson, Davenia McFadden, Loretta Wyman, Nestor Carbonell, Joel Edgerton and a host of others who parade by or die so quickly that their character names are difficult to remember.The script has moments of crude comedy, a lot of toilet talk, and an ending that tries to make the entire ride meaningful. It is worth a watch for the pyrotechnics of camera and sound work (and if the viewer has a high tolerance for violence), but renting it first to test your taste is advisable.

21,The_Void,Big borin' mess!,3,13 June 2007,"I didn't want to get my hopes up too high for this one since most films released nowadays tend to disappoint, and it's a good job I didn't as Smokin' Aces is a huge mess of a film and nothing like the entertaining thriller it's trailers lead you to believe it is. Smokin' Aces is, unfortunately, just another one of those 'cool' thrillers along the same lines as Lucky Number Slevin and Kill Bill which features a load of offbeat characters and a no good story that basically just throws them all in a melting pot together. Indeed, writer-director Joe Carnahan seems to think that having his ""actors"" sprout off a few cringe-inducing scripts here and there will mask the fact that this is a film with no backbone. The plot (if you can call it that) revolves around some guy called Buddy Israel who decided to rat on the mob. That wasn't a very smart idea as now he has found himself the target of a whole load of hit men from across the states. Sound good? Yeah, I thought it sounded pretty good too. What a shame about the execution.This is supposed to be one of those 'interlocking stories' kind of films, but not only are the stories not very interesting; they don't go together very well either, which just makes Smokin' Aces feel like a big mess. This also ensures that the film is boring too and watching it is a lot like pulling teeth. I often found myself struggling on, hoping that something good was going to happen only to find myself constantly disappointed. 'Big name' actors Ben Afleck and Ray Liotta appear briefly and don't improve the credibility of the film at all. I'm guessing their appearances were so short as they wanted as little association with this movie as possible while still being paid, and who can blame them? Joe Carnahan directed the highly rated, and overrated, Narc a few years ago and bearing that in mind along with this film, I doubt I'll see another of his. It's a shame as he's set to direct an adaptation of James Ellroy's ""White Jazz"", which I'd still like to see despite it being the worst book in Ellroy's fantastic ""L.A. Quartet"". Overall, Smokin' Aces is a film to avoid!",Smokin' Aces
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Smokin' Aces,8,15 April 2007,"I've enjoyed Joe Carnahan's earlier movie Narc when it was shown here years ago, a gritty undercover narcotics cops and robbers story with Patric Jason and Ray Liotta as a crazed unorthodox cop. Here in Smokin' Aces, a few of the same techniques are employed as to the presentation and style in which the movie was shot, and it makes this movie such an adrenaline rush.The movie's title refers to the the wanting to bump off Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven), an acclaimed Las Vegas magician with ties to the Italian mob, and who's about to squeal to the Feds and thereafter vanishing into the Witness Protection programme. Naturally, the mob has a contract put out, and all the bounty hunters and contract killers, from the likes of Ben Affleck to Alicia Keys (yup, in her first action movie), congregate in a Lake Tahoe hotel to try and lay claim to Aces' life.Standing in their way are two FBI agents Richard (Ryan Reynolds) and Donald (Ray Liotta again, from Wild Hogs and Carnahan's Narc), whose perspective of the case we take on, and journey together up until its revelation, with so many twists in store, that you can't help but to pay close attention. Loaded with plenty of guns and shoot em ups, Smokin' Aces delivers enough thrills and spills for the action crime thriller fans, especially when there are ample opportunities presented due to the presence of a large ensemble cast.What's interesting is to observe how professional hit men go about their business, in wheeling and dealing their way, inching as close as they can to the mark. With a deal as hot as this, two or more groups going in at the same time, in a speed race, will naturally set their gunsights on one another, intentionally or otherwise, and it's a blast to see how they wriggle in and out of such situations, in classic black-eat-black scenarios. Having battles on many fronts make this a never-ending roller coaster ride.But it's not the action that's top notch - violent, brutal and bloody, which is easy to degenerate the movie into a blood sport, but the ending which I thought is a bit unconventional, though nonetheless powerful. It's a sign to the authorities, who are always screwing up, tripping themselves with cock ups and protocols, that enough's enough, and to quit the bullshit talk. I've never been held breathless at an ending for some time already, and Smokin' Aces gets that credit.Highly recommended to those who like their thrillers take the necessary build up and assembling all the chess pieces, ready to strike at any moment, followed by the unleashing of plenty of mayhem right up until the end. Smokin' hot!",Smokin' Aces
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,This movie gave me such a headache,2,30 June 2007,"I'm not sure how this movie has a 6.7, seriously, I was so excited to see this film when I saw that it had a decent rating. I got it as a free rental, so I figured I would see what it was about, after all it had a very promising cast. Including Ray Liotta who is a very under rated actor and in my opinion didn't get enough credit after Goodfellas. But anyways, I just saw this film a couple days ago and I just really couldn't get into it, it just kept making these sudden movements and wouldn't stop with the loud noises or constant trying to be witty but not so much remarks. Whoever this director was, he is not Martin Scorcesse or Francis Ford Coppola or not even Michael Bay, I think he was trying to combine them.OK, from what I gathered, there is this guy, Buddy 'Aces' Israel, a former mafia member turned snitch, when he has to testify in court, he doesn't want too, but he doesn't get off so easy. He's pretty much got the whole world after him and they don't want him living. But only two detectives are protecting him and they are definitely going to have to be on their best alert for this guy since there is a bunch of bounty hunters also trying to get him.Smokin' Aces tries to be a hip new mafia movie that just very much misses instead of making it into a hit. The acting wasn't really good, the camera work must have been done by a guy who plays too many video games, and the story was just confusing, it was too distracting since the movie was just so loud and stupid, it gave me such a headache. This movie in no way deserves a 6.7 rating, I've seen soooo much better. I wouldn't recommend this for a watch, especially to those who have a great appreciation for true mafia films.2/10",Smokin' Aces

25,Buddy-51,a tone of viciousness undercuts the fun,5,20 July 2007,"Joe Carnahan's ""Smokin' Aces"" is a Tarantino-type crime drama with a cast of characters almost as extensive as the one in ""War and Peace."" The catalyst for the story is a Vegas magician named Buddy ""Aces"" Israel who's being targeted for assassination for turning state's evidence against the mob. As the plot advances, a vast assortment of professional killers and FBI agents, all determined to get their hands on the target, converge on the Lake Tahoe hotel where Israel is staying.With its absurdly over-the-top violence, smart-alecky sense of humor and broad narrative canvas, ""Smokin' Aces"" has clearly patterned itself after the granddaddy of all postmodern crime dramas, ""Pulp Fiction."" Shot through what appears to be an ugly yellow filter, the movie has a certain energy and style, punctuated by clever scene transitions and some occasionally witty dialogue. It's also riddled with some of the most gruesomely graphic - and surprisingly sadistic - violence this side of the ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"" franchises.Jeremy Piven and Ryan Reynolds are, more or less, the leads in the film, but the movie is crowded with such familiar faces as Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Alex Rocco, and an almost unrecognizable Michael Fox (""Lost"") in supporting roles.There's plenty for action film aficionados to sink their teeth into in ""Smokin' Aces,"" but it's the overall mean-spiritedness that spoils the fun of this one.",Smokin' Aces
26,FeastMode,my notes,5,26 July 2019,"Eh. it didn't know what it wanted to be. if this movie was done right i woulda loved it. shoulda been a don't-take-it-seriously awesome fun badass movie. but it tries to be serious and smart. the seriousness is okay but doesn't mesh with the movie, and the smartness just fails. there is some entertainment value here, and the cast is insane, i counted 14 actors i knew including plenty that i like. but as a whole it didn't come together the way i would have liked (about 2 viewings)
SPOILERS
they tried to make the story complex and have a big reveal at the end. but it just didn't fit. the rest of the movie was basically story-less, except when they would try to add these weird scenes that seem to be out of no where, until you realize they were trying to build to this twist ending. those earlier scenes only work if they fit in naturally with the rest of the movie. plus it was a pretty stupid twist. it was really his father who needed ace's heart to transplant so he can live longer, effectively killing his son, oh and also this is the former undercover FBI agent who had facial surgery to look different. fr? i loved the song they played in the final scene, but the gravity of that scene just didn't hit",Smokin' Aces
27,Robert_duder,Absolutely mind blowing action and a unique flare to the typical plot,9,5 February 2007,"Smokin' Aces wasn't my first choice to see...it was the only thing left to see and had a decent cast so I gave it a try and wow did it ever blow me away!! Smokin' Aces turned out to be an absolutely wild ride with a certain unique flare to what otherwise would be a stereotypical plot. One man...a rat to the mob and a price on his head...has a wide variety of ruthless killers and assassins merging on his hotel hideaway to kill him. The film is brutally violent...Tarantino violent...and some absolutely stunning stunts and fight scenes. The premise of the film gives the ability to have a variety of characters and plenty of violence. The film has a dark almost twisted humor to it and keeps you riveted beginning to end, Smokin' Aces is definitely the first really great movie of 2007.The cast is a mix of all kinds of actors and they are all terrific. Ryan Reynolds is sort of the lead playing F.B.I agent Richard Messner who has been sent to escort the mob witness to safety but ends up in the cross fire when the assassins all arrive to take him out. Reynolds is one of my favorite new actors of the last few years. He has such a versatility for drama, action and comedy and he definitely fits the bill in this film. He does an amazing job. Ray Liotta is Reynolds' partner and more experienced agent. Liotta gets in touch with his bad-ass self from the old days and even though he's playing a good guy we are treated to the Liotta of yesteryear. Ben Affleck briefly plays bail bondsman Jack Dupree and the role is so small that I think they cast him simply to put his name on the poster. Taraji P. Henson and Alicia Keys are brilliant as the mercenary girls for hire that are brutal and merciless when it comes to their marks. Jeremy Piven makes an outstanding performance as Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, the mob informant who is ready to turn over everything he has for his own freed. Piven is slimy, drug addicted, angry and just an incredible character. One of the best!! The cast is so huge I could list far beyond what this space would allow me but look out for strong cameo's by Matthew Fox, Peter Berg, and Andy Garcia and so much more.At the climax of the film bullets are flying, weapons of all kinds are blasting and it's a full on war!! Smokin' Aces could be compared to Kill Bill or The Transporter with it's unique blend of action, violence with this gritty old time feel to it. Any person who loves action films or just wants some mindless guns blazing will absolutely love Smokin' Aces. I don't know what holds me back from slapping a perfect score on this because this was the best film I have seen of 2007. Bravo!! 9/10",Smokin' Aces
28,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Impressively done thriller but one you'll probably have to watch twice to get the most out of,6,1 March 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Hot Las Vegas magician Buddy Israel (Jeremy Piven) got involved with the mob and was getting into the life of organized crime himself, but when things got too hot he turned to the feds and agreed to turn states evidence against some of the mob's top dogs. Naturally, before he knows it, a sizeable bounty has been placed on his head and, as he stakes out in an LV casino, every gun for hire, from neo nazi lunatics to typically feisty getto sistas, are out to kill him. Into this crazy mesh, some law abiding people are also out for him the shape of FBI agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta) and bounty hunter Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) and his team, all building up to one crazy, wild final showdown.This is just a basic sketch of Smokin' Aces's plot, which is actually far more intricate and clever, which you have to pay a surprising amount of attention to. It's definitely a film I'll have to watch again sometime to pick up things I may have missed before, or maybe it's just messy and, as a result, rather boring. Director Joe Carnahan has crafted a film very much in the style of Quentin Tarantino, from dialogue delivery to use of characters. As a result, there's a lively cast going on here, from Reynolds, Liotta, Piven, Affleck, Alicia Keys and Andy Garcia and all provide an essential role to the film.A film you come away from not sure whether to admire it's cleverness or see it as rather messy, Smokin' Aces is so bewildering your best bet is probably to watch it twice to see what you really thought. ***",Smokin' Aces
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Tries so hard to be 'cool' but unceremoniously collapses at every hurdle.,3,10 April 2018,"Despite a simple premise seemingly rife with possibilities, this fast-moving yet unfocused action thriller bounces around from character to character without any real through-line until it reaches a twist-ending that thinks it's more clever and important than it actually is (as it doesn't even impact anything really). 'Smokin' Aces (2006)' is a film that screams ""I'm cool"" at every chance it gets but rarely makes more than a whimper, especially when placed in a room with its much more effortlessly stylish peers. Unfortunately, the script features frequent expository dumps that overload the viewer, making it hard to retain any of the information, and the infrequent action is always brief and underwhelming. The movie really isn't fun and it's actually quite cringe-worthy, at times. 4/10",Smokin' Aces
30,bowmanblue,There's a good film in there somewhere,7,11 February 2015,"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was the first film I saw which involved multiple sets of characters going about their - murderous - business, independently of each other, only for their paths to eventually cross. There may be other movies before Lock Stock which have used a similar model, but I can't name them right now.Since then, both America and Britain have produced more of the same sorts of gangster movies. Smoking Aces is one such film. Only this time we add the FBI into the mix as they try to save potential informant Buddy 'Aces' Israel from being assassinated by several different contract killers.I've watched Smoking Aces three times now and each time I find I've forgotten what it's all about (or the finer details and plot twists). I'm not sure whether it's a good thing or not that a - quite complex - film leaves my memory so quickly. Either way, I do enjoy it, even though it probably could be better.With any film which utilises many characters, you can expect the story to never be able to do every last one of them justice. Many of the hit men are simply one-dimensional tools, used to move the plot (or what little plot there is) forward.Perhaps Smoking Aces is a victim of its own aspirations. It tries to be incredibly complex, but ends up being a bit confusing if you're trying to follow it too closely. Either way, it's a daft, fun film that shouldn't be taken too seriously. If you like your gangster films gritty and violent - and aren't bothered by a few plot inconsistencies - give it a go. It's not half as bad as some of the other reviewers are making out. It's no classic, but it's worth a watch nonetheless.",Smokin' Aces

I felt like I had seen this movie before because the set up of characters is just like other movies by Richie or Tarentino. The film has a lot of characters and gives them dialoge to set up their character. A lot of the conversations are humorous. From the 2 female killers to the trio of crazies. The main plot is Buddy Isreal whom is involved with the mob is hiding out in a penthouse of a hotel. He has a lot of people who want him dead and cops who want him to testify. The cops have to wait till a deal is reached before bringing him in. A lot of funny characters get involved whom are hit-man and come up with different ways to get to Isreal.And there is a big twist at the end with Isreal, Primo, and the Suede. My main complaint is we have seen this type of movie before and the writer/director is just not as original as Tarentino.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good and entertaining.

32,g-bodyl,Taratino-Style Shoot-Em-Up!,8,26 October 2014,"Smokin' Aces is an entertaining though incredibly violent action film that tries to replicate the success that were the works of Quentin Taratino. It comes marginally close, but if one looks closely, there is a difference. The dialog is usually spot-on in a Taratino film, but it's more choppy here. That being said, there is no lack of insane action and crazy deaths. I suppose the movie did its job with all the bullets flying everywhere.Joe Carnahan's film lacks a concise plot thus making the film a little hard to follow at times. But the gist of the plot involves the Feds and these contract killers who were hired to take down a mob target and in order to get to the target first, everyone starts a war with one another.This film actually has a stacked cast. We have Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta as our Feds. We have Chris Pine as a leader of the Neo-Nazis. We have Ben Affleck, who could have used more screen time. We also have the likes of Andy Garcia, Joel Edgerton, Jason Bateman, and Chris Pine. I think everyone did a good job and it's clear that everyone had a fun time.Overall, Smokin' Aces can be described as a ""B"" movie. It's not bad in any sense, but the film makes no sense whatsoever. It's funny, incredibly brutal, and well-acted. If you are the one to like Taratino-style gore, then you should be pleased here. It lacks a concise story, but we really don't care with this kind of film. All I cared were those bullets. I rate this film 8/10.",Smokin' Aces

Great script -- a crazy concept well addressed, with a script that even now is several notches above the stuff that JJ Abrams is currently peddling. Logic says that a movie about a bunch of idiosyncratic assassins converging on a single target should not work, should not make sense, but this story strikes just the right balance between sensible and nuts; 2. Cast? In this genre, probably the largest assortment of stars ever assembled. Credit for not merely trying something new, but front-loading it with talent to spare. 3. Direction? As good or better than any martial arts film, in other words, a very high standard, every bullet seems to go somewhere. 4. Ending? Clever, attention-getting and satisfying.

Instead the audience is presented with an extremely raw violent crime drama that has a lot of killing, explosions, and body parts. This is a gripping, seriously directed and photographed movie that hits its audience with a myriad of emotionally throbbing and heart pounding scenes with people dying, some of whom in typical movies would survive. The harsh reality and the decent twist in this movie brings to full steam the scalding brilliance of strange characters moving at full throttle. Probably too violent and insane for a number of people, this crime drama genre movie really hits home for its authenticity in parts and its cult weirdness in others (an American version of Snatch).

It also had a simple but interesting plot with some plot twists that I could not predict and that's also something that made it even more interesting. The interpretations of Ray Liotta who played as Donald Carruthers, Ryan Reynolds who played as Richard Messner and Jeremy Piven who played as Buddy Israel were very good and along with some other interpretations of the cast made this movie so different.

This film is an overload of multiple characters and it shifts from scenes very quickly. The story is relatively simple yet confusing and not too interesting for an ensemble of crew. The main problem is the ensemble of characters and very few to root for, which most of them are unlikable and not too interesting.

It's not really fluff, nor is it light or forgettable. It's incredibly well-made and intriguing in its unique qualities in terms of action cinema. Joe Carnahan, the writer and director of microbudgeted indie Blood Guts Bullets and Octane and the cop drama Narc, has always seemed to me a sort of director who is influenced by other contemporary directors with classic bodies of work, yet he does not really make films that influence. My opinion changed once I left the theater upon seeing Smokin' Aces. Its plot and the unraveling of it are very unlike those of other pure action films. The story builds in a differently nonlinear way, to a specific two very unconventional situations with a very creative similarity that intercut with each other, then blend in.Carnahan has made the best of his three feature films to date. It's a mêlée of creativity that builds upon everything you would ever want out of a shoot-em-up, slice-n-dice action movie. He may still carry his story a little too quickly as he has done to an extent with his previous films, but it's all part of the style. Smokin' Aces has maybe three scenes in the movie that are more than two minutes long. And they, like the rest of the scenes, are intercut with other strands of action occurring at the same time or with flashbacks that are repeated only to give away a fraction more than it did the last time. Is this really the best and most effective way to tell this story in a film? I don't know. Maybe it is. What it does is it sets a hundred-mile-per-hour pace, one that has every reason to be expected in an action movie. The movie is pure style. Carnahan is a good director, even if he makes it clearer than most filmmakers exactly where he is in his growth as a director and the stages of his career. He still, though, has not passed the point where he is showing the world what he can do and how cool it is. But that's just fine.Carnahan has created some of the most unforgettable, blood-soaked, clinically psychotic action sequences and scenes of violence in contemporary cinema. This is a gangster film, but that does not stop him from giving it dashes of what you'd expect from the Kill Bill movies, The Road Warrior, and anything from Hong Kong or Japan. The violence is particularly graphic and even at times a little disturbing. You mark my words. This film has set new boundaries for screen action and violence.It's hard to really judge the performances in the film. Hardly any actor gets very much time to act. Not a single character is developed to the point where you care whether they live, die or turn out. I can say that I was very happy to see Ray Liotta, being one of my favorite actors, I liked seeing Ben Affleck in the gritty role that he was in, I was glad to see Peter Berg is still around, and the rapper-actors Common and Alicia Keys were not hollow and detracting the way most expect rapper-actors to be. The one actor who does get to act, Jeremy Piven, is unforgettably great. If he doesn't steal the movie, he at least matches the violence. He is completely over- the-top in delivering the melodrama of his character. He very visibly enjoyed every single frame of playing his role. He could live and breathe this role for the next twenty years if given the chance. The incredible amount of show and pageantry jam-packed into his performance make it strangely remarkable.Smokin' Aces is an incredible, rock-music-blaring, testosterone-driven, blood-spattered entertainment. I feel cleansed having seen it. I didn't need to think too much, it didn't require any patience whatsoever, and it's a complete escape from reality.",Smokin' Aces
42,videorama-759-859391,Smokin',8,11 March 2014,"Buddy Israel (a wonderful Jeremy Piven) master magician, ex mafia, now turned Snitch (the one who'll give up anyone, but aren't they all snitches like that) doesn't realize how many people want him dead. Taking top floor sanctuary in a towering penthouse apartment in Vegas, his days are filled with boozing and whoring, one pro, coked up, who falls back through a glass table. Ensuring Piven's safety for one bloody good reason, are two agents (Liotta, solid, and younger Reynolds) This is all becomes an exciting, action, and extra bloody thriller. Some of the assassins are not only merciless but have scary intelligence, as we're given a little bit of background on em' in mini flashbacks, one of them a man of many faces, who obviously loves latex. The film also gives some Aussie stars a chance to boost the resume, Henderson great, part of a trio of ex cops turned assassins. You love how Henderson's fate works out, when surviving a shootout. Joel Edgerton, plays a Russian bad arse to A1 standard. I did love the film, but there's too many assassins/characters. They're are in excess, like everything else is in the film, but I don't really have a problem with the other stuff. Let me tell me you, there's an assortment of them too, including some ""you don't mess with black women sorts"". Also we have an anarchist trio, the ones who took down the ex cops at Lake Nevada, one of them looking much like Nick Stahl, you'll know who I mean. There's some great shootouts too, plus a priceless finale. Smokin' Aces has a great story behind it, I was amazed by how much went into it. Head of FBI, Garcia, very good, is now showing signs of aging. One of the guys who's been given up, is a crooked attorney, played by a face we haven't a long time.

43,GOWBTW,O.K. So who's the winner?,7,20 January 2008,"If ""Pulp Fiction"" was easy to understand, why isn't this movie? All you got is a magician/snitch who was joining the underworld in Las Vegas, only to get himself messed up and incoherent. Then he decides to help out the Feds and bring down the crime families. Just one thing; many hit men from every corner wants to ice Buddy Israel(Jeremy Piven). Guess getting more money wasn't all what's cracked up to be. Here you got ex-cops, hit men, contract killers, and the FBI. The question is ""Who'll will reach Buddy Israel first?"" Seems like everyone is out for themselves. One killer will cancel out the other. Or so it seems. Shoot outs erupt, and the Feds are caught in the middle. One Fed(Ray Liotta) is shot up by a mercenary. And some wild killers take on hotel security and Feds. One Fed(Ben Affeck) is fed up with lies and secrets, so he sacrificed his career by pulling the plug on father and son. That sacrifice is payment for his partner's death. Great cast this movie's got. Alicia Keys didn't do a bad job playing a killer. A lot of shooting was going on, but it was fine. 3 out of 5 stars!",Smokin' Aces
44,Chris Knipp,Cultish misfire still leaves some hope of better to come from Carnahan,7,4 February 2007,"The huge shoot-out around a big hotel suite that ends Smokin' Aces is a ramped-up version of the finale of Tarantino's True Romance (directed by Tony Scott). The elaborate and preposterous explanation that concludes this new movie is straight out of Brian Singer's puzzler put-on The Usual Suspects. There are numerous homages to the likes of Kitano and Sergio Leone. Carnahan's second major film makes his previous crime cop double-cross story Narc seem stolid and purist by contrast (though even Narc was pumped up and violent and began with a high-speed chase). Carnahan has seemingly decided to pull out all the stops and just have fun. His rapturously excessive tale of a bunch of competing tribes moving in on Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven), a coke-hound magician and Mafia sidekick turned FBI snitch holed up in a Tahoe palace while the feds strive to save him, is a free-floating hybrid of mainstream actioner, B-picture exploitation, midrange cameo-fest, and ultra-cynical Tarantino knockoff. It's a cinephile's sketch pad augmented by substantial technical means. Despite its obvious failings, which we'll get to in a second, Smokin' Aces provides enough eye-popping moments and odd characters and spicy dialogue to entertain, though the obviously inventive Carnahan (who wrote as well as directed) has neither the ear nor the organizational skill of Pulp Fiction's creator. The result probably could never have fared well with critics and certainly hasn't.Even if Carnahan revealed a tendency to push things too far even then, Narc had freshness and intensity. You can see that same quality in the hyped up opener of Smokin' Aces where FBI agents in a van (including Narc veteran Ray Liotta) argue with other operatives and even talk over the dialogue of the Mafia honcho they're watching and eavesdropping on. The flashy editing and grainy images provide a caffeinated buzz that makes you eager for more. One overall trouble with what follows is its subject is static: ""Aces"" Israel just sits there wallowing in his coke hangover and his self pity flipping cards as whores and bodyguards come and go and the Tahoe scenery radiates outside mockingly through the huge hotel picture windows. Another serious problem is that some of the would-be assassins moving in for the million-dollar reward, such a a bail bondsmen (Ben Affleck) and some sidekicks and some tattooed maniacs from a horror movie who off them, are just tossed in for flavor, when a little more depth in the main characters would have been far preferable. The competing gangs provide an opportunity for parallel action but like his critics, Carnahan has diced and sliced his sequences rather than organized them into neat groupings. There is nonetheless some suspense and excitement, but the action and the explanations are so busy it's quite impossible to follow and therefore hard to appreciate.Affleck, not tragic like in Hollywoodland, is amusing during his brief turn. Piven unfortunately has nothing to do but vegetate (however convincingly). Among many well cast and well-differentiated minor characters, I loved the maniacal but sweet-faced hillbilly methfreak who kills Affleck and then makes him into a reassuring ventriloquist's dummy, I liked the tough grandma who saves an agent from hypothermia and the hyperactive kung-fu monster kid she's caretaking. I liked the nasty-talking pair of black female hit persons, one going in for the kill as a leather-skirted hooker while the other, wired to her, watches manning heavy weaponry in the opposite building. I was less impressed by Wayne Newton as himself or Andy Garcia as a mushy-mouthed FBI exec, looking and sounding like a muffled version of some earlier role. When a nasty who's posed as FBI and now poses as hotel security clashes with Liotta's agent, and they both lie dead on an elevator floor and then slowly seem to come back to life, that's memorable. Elevators take on a life of their own in this movie, and some of the hotel action rivals Soderbergh's Oceans series.The thing about Tarantino on steroids and speed though is that one essential element is missing: the ability to stop the action and engage in some ridiculous but unforgettable banter like Samuel L. Jackson's with John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, or Dennis Hopper's speech to Chris Walken in True Romance, or the soothing professionalism that happens when Harvey Keitel as Winston ""The Wolf"" Wolfe comes in to clean up a blood-spattered car for Jackson and Travolta. It's the balance these calm moments creates that makes the violence sparkle. But maybe we all know that, and know that nobody writes dialogue like Tarantino in Pulp Fiction and True Romance, not even Tarantino. Carnahan can't do it, even though what he can do is maintain a consistent light tone and a sense of variety even if after a while you get too confused to altogether care. The overall impression of the entertaining but not quite successful Smokin Aces is of a squandering of obvious writing and directing talent. Let's hope he'll hit the target better next time, perhaps by exercising a little more restraint.",Smokin' Aces
45,elshikh4,Sophisticated and Noisy Vapidity !,1,14 January 2011,"After watching this movie, I kept saying: ""Idiot.. Idiot.. So idiot!"". So, let's see why.At first, through its trailer, I knew that it's a hip crime movie, with lust for violence and video clip style. And after the first 10 minutes of the movie itself, I knew it has many storylines, with different fighting teams (black, Italian, neo-Nazi,..). But as entertaining nonsense, nothing entertained me. And as smart movie with something to say, then it has a lot to say only about being not smart!The movie looks sophisticated, but that leads to nothing. In fact, it alleges being intelligent (a monologue about what's real while it's not). Or philosophical (We are all dying). Or - and that's the most pathetic - satiric (the police cheated its men to save the mafia boss). So with all the numerous characters, the on-screen boards to identify with them, the non-stop blood, drug use, nudity and profanity--the movie ran heavy, sick and truly trivial.Look at the end; Oh God!, the police officer (Messner), played by (Ryan Reynolds), is so mad due to the way how his superiors double-crossed him, which caused the murder of his older partner. And when he discovered that his superiors' purpose was saving the crime lord, to know his endless information about the mob, he KILLED the crime lord along with the last's son (who had the heart that his father needed to live) in one of the most stupid and adolescent idealism ever praised in a Hollywood movie yet!I thought that if the script made the police superiors save the crime lord because he bribed all of them earlier, then the whole system is corrupted, hence doing that move at the end would have been kind of desperate idealism anyway. Otherwise, what we watched was no heroic or noble deed at all, rather someone who reacted with anger that destroyed the superiors' plan, his own future, along with the whole case as well. More than clear how this movie is dead set to be idiot!Even the end's twist is weak and corny. ""Weak"" because it doesn't add much to the story. So that lord himself is an old governmental agent.. Big deal! Does that *surprising* info give the government a cause to arrest him?, and if it does; then what's the proof?! And ""corny"" because I predicted it long time ago, since the movie's insistence on repeating both the moment of killing the agent with dark faces, and the talk about the lord's plastic surgeries. By the way, how a piece of info like this was kept totally unknown for more than half a century, then got uncovered in that particular day?! And speaking about plot holes, originally who leaked the erroneous matter, about marking the magician for death and pulling out his heart, to the street's killers?!The intention to portray a world of killing with some wise reading was purely absurd. So 2 fighting souls fall suddenly in love, the police officer looks the other way to give these new love birds a chance to runaway!, a child takes Ritalin while wanting to play karate, and someone who couldn't be forgivable when it came to the one who cut off 4 of his fingers. What's the meaning of that? The answer is NONE. You know what I hate more than a sophisticated and noisy crime movie? A sophisticated and noisy crime movie that tries, foolishly, to look deep.What's bugging me though is the presence of many stars, some I respect like (Andy Garcia). How they agreed to be in this stupidity?! See how (Jeremy Piven) gives his Oscar worthy performance, as someone who lost everything including his life, living an inevitable tragedy. But alas, all of that was in the wrong place with the wrong script. It has colors, a bit sane pace, and strong direction. That's the only merits I found here. Director (Joe Carnahan) is better than writer (Joe Carnahan). This irony wronged the movie very much.So, why was the ""idiot"" remark repeatedly? I believe I meant the movie, all whoever participated in it, and all whoever thought that it might have an admiration the way it was!",Smokin' Aces
46,freemantle_uk,Was this film serious or a comedy?,3,22 March 2008,"I did not like this film when I saw it. If it was meant to be a serious film it's plot was radicals, if it was a comedy it failed badly. The plot of the film was Buddy 'Aces' Israel was a magician who tried to play gangster and became involved with the Mafia. He then turned on the Mafia and became the FBI's top informant. As you can imagine the mafia weren't to happen and play a $1 Million hit on his head. This leads to many assassins trying to get to Aces and they end up fighting each other, the FBI and Aces' bodyguards. I feel the film didn't work on this concept and it just turned into a violence bloodbath. My friends who I went with to this film felt the same. It wasn't a well written and the film was poor. They were attempts to add poor twists to the film but again these didn't what and made the film look worst.

49,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A rollicking fun action thriller,9,2 July 2015,"Joe Carnahan's Smokin Aces. Violent. Hilarious. Eclectic. Colourful. Brilliantly written. This film is one of many I bring up when I meet a film snob who turns their noses up at any kind of pulpy, below the belt, cubist action comedy that isn't a profound statement on the human condition blah blah. While I love discerning the ephemeral themes that high minded films have to offer, I live in the real world where films are there to entertain, first and foremost, and entertaining is an understatement for this movie. Carnahan reaches into his magicians hat and pulls out a loud, lovable, obnoxious bunch of cops, feds, femmes Fatale, assassin's, Vegas lowlifes and assorted psychos that would make a circus ringmaster blush. I won't get too much into the intricate plot, but it involves a whole bunch of seedy weirdos out to get an even seedier Vegas showman and small time thug who's about to turn states evidence. That's all you need. From there the film takes off into orbit from shootout to ridiculous wordplay to unconventional romance to surprising emotional hurt and everything in between. Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as an idealistic FBI agent who very quickly becomes disillusioned and jaded by his superior (Andy Garcia), and Ray Liotta is brilliant as his partner. Jeremy Piven is hilarious, Common gives his role an uncanny depth, and there are really memorable, star making supporting turns from Jason Bateman, Martin Henderson, Tommy Flanagan and Nestor Carbonell. Chris Pine is hilarious in a role so demented it's amazing he managed to top it in weirdness with his turn in Carnahan's excellent recent film Stretch. Ben Affleck shows up long enough to play pool and get ventilated by an MP5, and watch for Matthew Fox in an unrecognizable cameo. I love a good action film noir comic book style thriller. I hate when people get on their high horse, call it a Tarantino ripoff, call it brainless and void of any serious meaning. They seem to forget that movies, although apt to bring us serious brain food and existential weight, are there to make sure we have fun as well.

50,fertilecelluloid,Not quite the film its trailer suggests,7,27 January 2007,"Joe Carnahan's ""Smokin' Aces"" is not the film the trailer suggests -- it is, in fact, slower and more complex. The action sequences, which are a good reason to see the film, are bloody and graphic, but they don't appear as frequently as you might think. As Carnahan demonstrated with ""Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane"" and ""Narc"", he has a fondness for cop and crim jargon, so it's not surprising that ""...Aces"" is very talky and populated with chatty characters. The set-up is simple: When a large price is put on the head of a man who is about to snitch out his associates, a bunch of professional assassins descend on the Lake Tahoe hotel where he is holding up in order to take him out. Why a mafia kingpin wants to take him out is the film's lynchpin. My favorite scene was a quiet one: A black man, recently betrayed by his boss, carries an injured hitwoman down a stairwell. In a weird, nicely written way, they fall for each other within a two minute time frame. It's the most real scene in the film. As an action director, Carnahan knows how to serve up the goods. He goes ultra-gory in a couple of places and retains a strong element of nihilism. Although the action sequences in ""Running Scared"" were better, this is, overall, a stronger, more solid film with more on its mind than its marketing promises.",Smokin' Aces

It had it's problems, but it was still entertaining and it wasn't a brain-dead film. The basic plot is several groups of people are out to kill a mobster tied magician Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Piven). Chaos ensues as the plot thickens. I'll start with the negatives of the film. There is very little character development. We are introduced to the characters right away and all at once, and we are given their names and professions on screen in subtitles. Too much of the movie seemed like a plot setup, and not enough getting in to caring about what was actually happening. The movie lacked it's own style. The type of camera work would change from scene to scene which would get annoying. As for the positives, this was extremely entertaining! I was interested in what was happening every second, and even though they weren't developed, I still liked watching the actors giving great performances. Jeremy Piven was my favorite in the cast as the womanizing, cocaine addicted magician who in one scene was so stoned he was covering up sides of his face to the mirror. Jason Bateman gave a great, memorable cameo also. The dialogue was actually pretty good and I was interested just listening to them talk. Though there was no defined style, it was funny how bizarre certain parts were done, like the ADHD kid on Riddelin doing super fast karate and talking like a lunatic while his guardian just laughed and paid no attention. So in all, even though this film does have major problems, it's entertainment value, good acting and fun script keep this well afloat.My rating: *** out of ****. 104 mins.

53,Jonny_Numb,Smokin' the Competition,7,14 May 2008,"Done improperly, ""Smokin' Aces"" could have been one hell of a painful, mind-numbing experience; its pedigree and inspiration seems to be the flash-edits, CG gunshots, and over-saturated color schemes of Michael Bay and Tony Scott, mixed with the quirky tough-guy characterizations and middle-drawer dialog of current Tarantino. My preconception of ""Aces"" was that it would fall in line with the direct-to-video imitators of the latter, which littered store shelves throughout the mid- to late-'90s. Heck, writer-director Joe Carnahan (""Narc"") even carved a name for himself with the low-budget caper ""Blood Guts Bullets and Octane,"" a film many attributed to Tarantino's influence. And had ""Aces"" been released during that creative black-hole of an era, it probably would have been lost in the imitative flood; over a decade later, however, Carnahan's attempt at a jackrabbit-paced, narratively complex splatterthon stands out with surprisingly bold conviction. While far from perfect, ""Smokin' Aces"" moves with such speed and flow that the various narrative entanglements add to the suspense of just how the whole thing will end up (instead of provoking mere frustration); Carnahan knows what he's doing, and overlaps plot points and characters like a pro, while adding occasional notes of sheer outrageousness (a gang of neo-Nazis who apply a variety of power-tools to their victims, for instance) to spice up the already hyperactive plot. And what about that plot? All I can really say is that several gangs of trigger-happy people are converging on a Vegas hotel to rub out washed-up magician Bobby ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven), who also happens to be a protected mob informant. Carnahan's layout of the film is skillfully done: the first 20 minutes introduce the Rogues Gallery (lots of well-clipped dialog), the midsection is chaotic (but remarkably well-choreographed) violence, and the conclusion is a genuinely effective bit of straight drama (carried by, of all things, Ryan Reynolds' straight-arrow performance). That being said, ""Aces"" crashes whenever it tries to indulge its attitude too much--as with the Tarantino imitators (and Tarantino himself), it can be pretty pretentious at times, and the straight dramatic stuff works better than the mostly futile attempts at humor; additionally, a plot point involving an FBI agent with a Keyser Soze complex is introduced and incorporated so hastily that it never feels like much more than the narrative McGuffin it is. Still, this is a pretty fine piece of work, and unlike the films of Bay or Scott, you won't feel like your intelligence has been insulted by the end.6.5 out of 10",Smokin' Aces

It was actually the release of this film that got him recognized to direct The A-Team (2010) reboot.

While Israel hides in his penthouse suite, F.B.I. agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta), amateur assassins Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) and his buddies played by Peter Berg and Martin Henderson, a rogue trained assassin Pasquale Acosta (Nestor Carbonell), chameleon killer Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan), Neo-nazi hillbillies Darwin (Chris Pine), Jeeves (Kevin Durand) and Lester Tremor (Maury Sterling) and lastly fem fatales Sharice Watters (Taraji P. Henson) and Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) all converge on that point to kill him. With all that said, hardly any of these characters have development.For a two-hour film one would think some kind of story would occur. Instead, there's a subplot about as to why Buddy Israel needs to be kept alive but it's written as some kind of government plan that is unnecessarily convoluted. Without saying much more, the story will in fact waste the time of the viewer. It completely makes everything pointless. Imagine realizing that after the movie ended, sitting and watching two hours of nothing. Substituted for that is an overstuffed cast of personalities that are difficult to connect with in any way and the list of names mentioned continues. There's also appearances from Common, Andy Garcia, Jason Bateman, Joel Edgerton and more. There's just too much to go around. That's not to say the cast can't act or don't have distinct personalities, they just feel rushed and wedged in. Along with that are unresolved character threads that do not conclude the way they should; they just go missing. There are also inconsistencies with security being a thing. How does someone get into a hotel with a sniper?There are also comedic bits thrown in but that's a mixed bag. Seeing Alicia Keys being a complete tough girl and spewing manly lines is fun. Then there's also a couple scenes where a knock-off karate kid shows his moves to one of the assassins. By golly is he annoying; why was he even included again? It's just unfunny padding that makes no sense. However, even with all this said, the technical quality of the film still thrives. Action-wise, again director Joe Carnahan proves that's his genre. He doesn't rely on the shaky camera effect to make action look real. He films real cinematic action and it's very entertaining. The type of action to this movie are just gunfights but its rated R so there's decent blood effects. At some points it even goes beyond that to the point of demented horror action. That's mainly credited to the Tremor Neo-nazi brothers for their weird antics. Speaking of which, Chris Pine had a stupid comical scene. Not hilarious, just enough to create one laugh.The director of photography to this picture was Mauro Fiore. Fiore was also the guy behind the camera for Training Day (2001), The A-Team (2010) and Southpaw (2015). All of which these films did not involve much of or if any shaky camera movement and that's commendable. There's no particular scene that isn't well lit nor is it frustrating to follow what happens. Clint Mansell composed the musical score. The scores Mansell has produced for various films range in critical praise but some are movies like Requiem for a Dream (2000), Sahara (2005), Moon (2009) and Black Swan (2010). Mansell's Smokin' Aces (2006) score may only be forty-five minutes, but there are number of solid action and emotional cues. Soft electric guitar and strings highlight the action, which helps get the blood pumping. The softer cues that easily stir the correct emotion use more acoustic guitar, and more drawn out strings in a tragic key. Mansell shows that he is proficient at both ends of the spectrum.Joe Carnahan is naturally a well-equipped action director and his technical crewmembers hit the mark as well in music and cinematography. The actors can act in their roles but with little development, very few come out feeling likable in any way. The story wastes time and the plot is bloated with too many character threads.",Smokin' Aces
59,lemon_magic,"Definitely a mixed bag, but had its moments",6,9 June 2007,"If I had to hazard a guess as to what director/writer Carnahan was going for with this movie, I'd have to go with ""Elmore Leonard meets Reservoir Dogs and Guy Ritchie, only with a bigger cast of characters."" Potential viewers should adjust their expectations accordingly, and PC soccer moms should stay away entirely.There were individual scenes and individual snippets of dialog and screen action and camera shots that I thought were really snappy and well done here. Ben Affleck reminded me why I liked him in the first place in his minor part; Ryan Reynolds gave a very impressive (if somewhat one dimensional) performance; Ray Liotta was his usual compelling self; and there are numerous supporting actors playing funny and quirky and ""interesting"" hipster outlaw characters...and yet the whole thing just did not come together.The real problem, for me, is that the screenplay starts out as something of an outlaw comedy, but suddenly turns bloody and grim and gruesome and then ends up glum and fatalistic and depressing (with the exception of a wonderful ""kiss off"" scene between the surviving bail bondsman/bounty hunter and the remaining Tremor brother). I'm not sure why Carnahan decided to end the story on the note he did. It seems to me that if you're going to do cheerful black hearted nihilism for 2/3rds of a film, you have no business switching moods to sincerity and outrage 10 minutes from the end.The plot is, of course, pandemonium, with a dozen aggressively hip characters bouncing off each other like cats in a laundry sack, and the back story is so twisted and convoluted that it hardly seems worth the eventual payoff. To give the screenplay fair credit, though, it does play fair with the audience and I guessed the movie's big ""twist"" ending far in advance based on clues planted early on. So there's a plus and a minus there.I started out thinking I might buy this DVD for the first 30 minutes, (I'm a sucker for well done caper films) but decided by the end that I might keep a copy in my collection if someone gave one to me...or maybe not. It was worth watching once, anyway.",Smokin' Aces
60,eric262003,Terrific Movie In Action and Humour,8,7 May 2012,".""Smokin Aces"" is film that will be fully recommended to fans who love their action violent, their humour dark and their freedom to let their brains relax. For fans of the action comedy, ""Smokin Aces"" will likely inspire you to watch this movie a second time around. Some of the scenes were so memorable, it'll inspire you to rewind some of the scenes because it was such a crazy film that every scene yearns for it's viewer's attention. Sure at times it's hard to keep up with who's killing who, but it never falls flat on excitement and the endless action never once gets watered down with any moral scruples. The central plot involves around Buddy ""Aces"" Israel and Las Vegas magician who starts getting involved with the local mafia. While he is situated in a penthouse suite, the mobsters levy a staggering bounty towards his heart as the mob leader wants his more vital inner organ removed. This in turn leads up to every greedy, scoundrel gunning for the prize. Even though there is some comedy implemented into the story, the gratuitous violence is a great cover up to the comedic elements and outweighs it by around seventy percent. It was hard to find yourself in laughter or disgust as a lot of blood was frequently drawn. And the body count was at times overwhelmingly unlawful.As Aces Israel, Jeremy Piven succeeds to producing the reddest blood-shot eyes since ""Dracula"". Ben Affleck and Andy Garcia turned up some memorable performances, but the best turn around goes to to singer turned actress Alicia Keys. She just seems to chew up every scene she's in and she does it splendidly. Sure lots of movies had packed on the twists and squeezed out the blood, but very few has gone over-the-top as ""Smokin Aces"". With an abundance of dead bodies and a no-nonsense delivery of lines by the cast, for people who love this kind of movie will have a ball with this film. Sure the characters come off as unlikable and the violence will make you wince at times, there is seldom a dull moment and if you can sit through the whole one hour and fifty minute duration of this movie, you must've had a hell of a good time.",Smokin' Aces
61,Matt_Layden,"""Smokin' Aces Is A Blender Baby""",7,28 January 2007,"Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is being targeted after snitching on the mob. The amount on his head is a staggering one million dollars. Now every hit-man and woman want a shot at it.If I were to ever make a film, Smokin' Aces is the type of film I would want to make. Although in my mind, my film is also 100 times better and wins a crazy amount of Oscars. Aces is a film that is not really original, but it does what it sets out to do and that is entertain. Sure it's not the perfect film, but it never tries to be. It suffers from a poor ending, too many characters and it becomes too Hollywood for it's own good. With everything that's wrong with it, it's also good. Carnahan delivers the film with a unique style and the film will definitely entertain. The film is not original, it takes bits a pieces from many other films: Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, any Tony Scott film and last years Lucky Number Slevin. Throw those films into a blender and you get Smokin' Aces. While Aces never reaches the greatness of those films it is good and deserves a chance. Listen to me and not those other uptight critics.Aces does have too many characters, the film takes a good twenty minutes to introduce everyone, but once you see them and are given that brief back story you don't need anything else. Are you suppose to connect with these characters? Aside from Reynolds and possibly Piven himself, the answer is no. You don't try to get to know these characters, you know they are contract killers and that's all you need to know. Instead you root for one of them, whoever you think is the ""coolest"" or most ""badass"". The characters are indeed diverse and over the top, you have: Ben Affleck as a bail bondsman, his two friends who are ex-cops, Bateman as a sleazy lawyer, two femme fatals, three insane Nazi like guys known as The Tremors, a torturer who doesn't torture anyone in the film, a man who changes identity and masks, Buddy Piven Israel and his crew, Reynolds and Liotta as the two FBI agents and their superior Garcia. Seems like a lot of people and it is, but you won't get confused as to who's who at any point.If I were to cut out some characters, the film could do without the kid and his granny, along with Israel's manager/lawyer. Instead give that screen time to more action. There I said it, the film could use a little bit more action. Don't get me wrong, the film does showcase enough violence to please the usual film goer, but I couldn't help but want a little bit more by the time the film was over. Speaking of which, when the film ended, it seemed like they didn't know what they wanted to do. So they threw in that trying to trick you bit that fails so many times when not done right. Half way through the film you know what the twist is and when they reveal the real reason behind the hit, it kind of ruins the rest of the film. Carnahan and his crew could have ended the film with a wrap up for each character, it would have better suited the film, but we are left with no explanation of what happens to whom.Now onto the whole ""Too Hollywood"" bit. You know in films when something happens to a character and you think they are dead? Only to discover they live at the end? Well that kind of happens here. Granted it's not as shocking as the other films, but it does become annoying. In one particular scene, two character shoot the living hell out of one another in an elevator, yet they don't die at the time, instead they live for another twenty minutes. Another character gets shot in the face, yet he lives. Aces also suffers from the ""Hollywood Minute"". This usually affects films that deal with bombs that are about to explode in 5 seconds, but it last for 2 minutes. Well it kind of happens here with certain characters. For example, one character is in the room with Aces and it's his mission to take his heart, which is what every hit-man must do. Well, he gets in their and kills the one body guard, then the film cuts to every other character. Twenty minutes go by and the same guy in that room is just putting his gun away after killing him. Everybody in the film does a good job with their characters and it was nice to spot those familiar faces in the cast, such as Matthew Fox from Lost fame and the one hit-man who people will recognize from Suddenly Susan. While the comedy doesn't really last throughout the entire film, it's Bateman who steals the comedy with his sleazy lawyer role. He delivers every line with comedy gold.Carnahan, who's previous film was Narc, has a unique visual style and it's present here as it was with Narc. Now Aces isn't as good as Narc, but that's only because these films are so diverse. Aces isn't set in any reality, this is evident throughout the entire film. None of this would ever happen in real life, so you know to just sit back and relax and enjoy the mayhem that appears. Piven plays his usual fast talking dirt bag character, only this time he has a few card tricks to flash the audience. Reynolds and Liotta work well together and Reynolds is the real standout in the entire cast. I would recommend this film for anyone who wants a good entertaining flick in which they can just sit back and enjoy the action.",Smokin' Aces
62,denis888,Could have been better if shorter and not so brutal,5,10 June 2007,"This film is half good, half poor. The good side is a great array of good actors - Andy Garcia, Piven, Alicia Keyes, Ray Liotta - among others, they play well, very persuading and deeply. The poor half is the predictable array of blood, killings, deaths, car wrecks, gun shootings, blood stains and dead bodies. The plot is very trite - a mafia guy who is also an illusionist, wanna say the truth, then mafia wanna kill him, so FBI tries to be first there not to get Israel killed, and then there are many shoot outs, much blood and much violence. If this film were shorter an hour, if there were not so much blood and deaths, then it would be much, much better. Ray Liotta is very good here as well as always elegant Andy Garcia, but even they do not save the poor script from dragging down.",Smokin' Aces

64,dunmore_ego,It's a mad mad mad mad assassination.,6,11 February 2007,"Occam's Razor: ""The explanation requiring the fewest assumptions is most likely to be correct."" In other words, ""Simpler is better."" *Smokin' Aces* is a walloping actioner with way too much exposition.There is more unnecessary dialog here than in the Pam and Tommy sex tape.Plot is simple: a mobbed-up magician/card shark, Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven) is about to canary to the FBI. Holed up in a Lake Tahoe hotel penthouse, the mob wants him dead  thank you, Captain Obvious! - and puts out not just a contract, but a bounty on his head for one million dollars. Out to scalp him is every vicious criminal and gunslinger in the west - rustlers, cutthroats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperadoes, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, half-wits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, horse thieves, train robbers, bank robbers, ass-kickers and Methodists.And writer-director Joe Carnahan (bastard spawn of Guy Ritchie) is intent on giving us back story on each and every one. With jump cuts slamming enough to knock over an elephant, we are introduced to crooked cops led by Ben Affleck, goth-insane Tremor Brothers, a steel-speared Persian-looking guy, a Welsh master of disguise, various other pain-meisters and do-badders  there's even an Ambiguously Lesbian Duo! And all the while we're wondering - if these muthas are so publicly badass, how is it that they haven't been arrested/killed/given a reality series yet? For pure visceral entertainment, this is the movie for you  problem is it loses focus: is it aiming for a gut-level slam to the reptilian brain, or trying to unspool a complex story with a half-relevant twist at the end? I'm here for the visceral, please stop with the dialog  too much talki- stop the talking! There's just TOO MUCH TALKING! A discernible thread is that of the two cops, Carruthers and Messner (Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds), trying to stop the hit, with Andy Garcia (supersuave as always) their superior officer with ulterior agenda.Jason Bateman scene-steals as an alcoholic, cross-dressing sleaze bag lawyer (nothing new, I know), Tommy Flanagan is chilling as the *Leon*/Hannibal master of disguise, and Ben Affleck does some of his best acting while he lies dead and his killer works his mouth like a puppet (the same method that was used in *Gigli*).The most disturbing murder is the intimate one, when Nestor Carbonell (as the Persian-looking guy) spears Bill the Security Guard and almost sensuously embraces him 'til death.Aussie Joel Edgerton does such a fantastic job of assimilating first his Russian character and then Tommy Flanagan's assassin character (who wears his rubber face - in reality, it is Joel playing the assassin) that we actually believe he is first a klutz Russian and then a nerveless assassin.There are some well-directed, tense moments, the usual shoot-em-up melees, an emphatic, tear-streaming performance from Jeremy Piven, with a half-lame twist at the end that prompts  you guessed it  more talking, as Ryan Reynolds actually says to Andy Garcia, the mastermind behind the quasi-scam, ""Make it all make sense.""",Smokin' Aces
65,chrichtonsworld,The wonderful performances save this movie,6,31 January 2007,"The first hour i wanted to give up watching this movie. The story was going nowhere. Suddenly the pace picks up and things get interesting. In the beginning the story is a bit chaotic. It is clear something is brewing. You know there is going to be a climax. The great climax and the wonderful performances by the actors make up for the confusing first 80 minutes. ""Smoking Aces"" reminded me of ""True Romance"". It had the same ambiance,only it lacked the humor ""True Romance did have""!.This is a big failure in my opinion. Because the lack of humor makes this movie too damn serious! It is quite difficult to like or care for the characters because we don't really get to know them well. We get very little to none background on the characters. This is a shame,the characters seem to be very colorful. Maybe this is done on purpose to keep things mysterious. But for me it would have been more effective if we knew more about the motives from the characters. The reason the movie stays compelling is thanks to the actors who with some exceptions perform superbly.

67,lambiepie-2,Smoking Aces is all about the 'magic' of 'deception',7,11 November 2007,"I wont lie - it took me some time to sit through one complete watching of this film, but when I finally did - I got it. Smokin' Aces - it's not so bad. It does have flaws, but it isn't totally horrid. It just misses the mark with many on what it seems to have wanted to do: Play out a big 'Vegas style' magic trick with a gangster/FBI related story to us, the viewing audience.""Smokin' Aces"", the title of the story, sums up all of what you are intending to see. Many folks deem this as guys-guy movie. Others an over-violent snooze. I have to remark, if that is what you focused on then you veered away from the ""Smokin' Aces"" - the trick. Understand the title and its context. Once you've done that, and can also get to end of the film -- it might dawn on you that its not bad. And what makes this film go all over the place - I have to say lies with the uncreativeness of the film's editing - not the acting, actors and script.I want to stand up for the script: it is intelligent. The challenge is making such an intelligent script - entertaining and believable. Hiring a bunch of good actors is one element, not the ONLY element. And it seems like they might have put a bit too much stock into that element than others.The basic story is a simple one: Buddy Israel, a slimy, pretty much well hated in his own circles, Las Vegas illusionist/entertainer who has been entrenched with one of the most powerful families of the mob in that State has information up to his nose and decides to turn evidence. The government wants this info, the mob wants him dead before he can turn over this info. Once the mob puts out a contract on a life worth 6 or 7 figures - it brings out all those who think they can fulfill the contract: the most vile and horrid hit men - and women. Teetering on this are bail bondsmen and other law makers caught up on one end of this or the other - not to mention Israel's own personal guards/entourage and confidants being put into a position of loyalty or betrayal by Israel's selfish hands.The idea of ""every scum and their momma"" wanting to take down ""Buddy Israel"" for such a high fee is a good one, but there were just a few too many players in this bunch. But..it is all part of deceiving us, the viewer like any good magician should.If ""Pulp FIction"" has taught us anything, it taught us that editing (film and music)can be profound on the viewers enjoyment. Jarr you a little. Question sequence. Question time. Regardless, some folks cannot get beyond a normal start-middle-finish flow - but when you mix it up...and it WORKS...all of a sudden your intelligent story becomes entertaining. Here is a PERFECT example of where creative editing could have made this film quite the compelling piece of entertainment.But...what I would like to get across to anyone who has seen 'Smokin' Aces' or are planning on seeing it -- is take it for what I felt was going on: A Vegas-stylized magic trick that tries to deceive the audience in the same manner. Did it deliver? Somewhat - sure it could have been tighter, better. But as I a a fan of ""Casino-Vegas"" type illusionists...there are those that 'wow' you and those that you think could have 'wow-ed' you ...if only.....That's Smokin' Aces in a nutshell. You'll either buy into the trick/deception as the writer/director hopes you will -- or you wont. I kinda did, and in doing so, found a film - even somewhat flawed, that wasn't so bad.",Smokin' Aces
68,IonicBreezeMachine,Joe Carnahan does Guy Ritchie by way of Usual Suspects and fails hard,4,28 December 2020,"Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is a second rate Las Vegas magician/wannabe mobster who knows the ins and outs the mob. After he bites off more than he can chew he organizes an immunity deal in exchange for divulging the ins and outs of his knowledge of the mob. His actions attract the attention of bounty hunters, assassins, rampaging neo nazis, and the FBI leading to a tangled mess of complications in and around his safe house at a lake Tahoe hotel/casino.The movie has a great cast with Ryan Reynolds, Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine (in one of his earlier roles), Jason Bateman, and too many others to name and all of them give good performances. There's clear chemistry between actors such as Taraji P. Henson and Alicia Keyes or Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta, and their performances are clearly committed and energized. It's just a shame it's in service of a script that is muddled, busy, confusing, and tone deaf and direction that is overly frenetic and unfocused.Smokin' Aces makes a bad impression from the get go as the opening 20 minutes is a near non stop barrage of exposition clumsily conveyed via FBI audio surveillance or among different sets of characters who we know nothing about so Carnahan places title cards over them with their name and occupation, not that it'll do much good because you'll forget who they are minutes after introduction. The movie as it starts seems like it's trying to be a Guy Ritchie style crime comedy like Snatch or Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels, but it's never as funny as it thinks it is and most of its ""humorous"" moments feel more awkward than funny. Some of the highlights include an A.D.D. middle schooler in a gi speaking gangsta while doing karate and sporting an erection, and another involves Chris Pine as a neo nazi killing someone then making their mouth move up and down like a puppet. On occasion the ad libbing between Reynolds and Liotta would get a chuckle, and Taraji P. Henson has some reasonably funny lines here and there, but most of the film consists of mind numbing violence and drunken debauchery in Buddy Israel's safehouse that is more obnoxious than funny.To add insult to injury the movie makes an abrupt tonal shift about half way through the film and decides it wants to be taken seriously. The movie that was trying to make you laugh and failing miserably is now going to try and pull a The Usual Suspects on you because it can't tell the difference between ""messy"" and ""complex"". That's not to say this kind of movie can't have a twisty narrative, the cult film Suicide Kings showed that quite effectively, but Smokin' Aces is not only not as funny as Suicide Kings, it's also less clever and doesn't know it.Smokin' Aces is an awful movie with good performances. It's script is crass and juvenile with jarring tonal shifts, and it's not clever enough to justify its twists nor is it funny enough to excuse its overstuffed narrative. This is a bad movie that shamelessly steals from better movies.Joe Carnahan does tries to do The Usual Suspects by way of Guy Ritchie and stumbles hard",Smokin' Aces
69,mentalcritic,An exercise in frustration,5,6 June 2007,"In a pair of articles on the Filmwad site, Smokin' Aces is described as the most frustrating film in the history of cinema, and one in need of another hour of footage. While I disagree with one article in that I have seen films far more frustrating (X-Men 3 comes to mind), it would take a miracle of the most extreme proportions to convince me that Smokin' Aces is not both too long and too short. But I will get into that later. What is important to understand is that films based on stories and ideas with this kind of potential are an everyday event in Hollywood. A handful go to glory, a bigger handful live up to their potential, a larger handful fall short of their potential, and then a microscopic number screw it up as royally as is the case here. Yet, in spite of being so hideously flawed that it would otherwise be in the trash heap, Smokin' Aces also redeems itself with some great action sequences and awesome characters. The latter, however, becomes more frustrating for the editing reason I outlined earlier.This is going to take some time to explain, so I will start with the bad. The cast of characters in any film where multiple criminals are fighting one another for the same goal is the single most important element. Films like Snatch or Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels get this right by recognising that the support characters are every bit as important as the leads. Smokin' Aces fouls this up by having a couple of characters one wants to follow, a lot of characters who fail to make so much as a blip, and a handful of characters that leave the viewer wondering what the screenwriter was smoking. In spite of being the whole focus of the film, ""Aces"" Israel gets about ten minutes of screen time. I disagree with the other choice Filmwad made regarding the other good character. I find Ray Liotta's performance in the film far more compelling than Jason Bateman's, but since both characters are so underutilised they utterly frustrate, the difference between them is neither here nor there.It is the worst characters that count against Smokin' Aces, because they also happen to be those with the greatest share of screen time. Alicia Keys and her staff are sheer torture to listen to, and their every scene is accompanied by the audience wishing they would just shut up and get the hell off the screen. Not that they are alone in this. Zach Cumer's character is not only an incredibly bad stereotype that belongs only in the mind of a schoolteacher from twenty years ago, he constantly begs the question of why nobody is slapping the little moron so hard his eyes rattle. Of course, answering the question of what happened to Martin Henderson's character requires some footage, but there are far more economical and endearing ways to do this. Ones that do not require the screenwriters to add a pair of characters who are either vacant or just plain irritating. Like the Tremor brothers or Soot, Zach Cumer comes off as having been spliced in from a very different film that I would not even consider worthy of a rental.Adding to the problems is that the directorial style is, put simply, awful. The fight between the Tremor brothers and hotel security had all the makings of a gorefest on the level of RoboCop. But what RoboCop had that Smokin' Aces did not is a director who understands that audiences need to see clearly what is going on for the proverbial money shots to have any real impact. In other words, payoffs are wonderful, but only when the setup is sufficient to make them so. The setups in the battle between the Tremors and hotel security are confusing, badly edited, and badly shot. Hence, what should have been the equivalent of the raid on the drug factory is instead a series of cutaways so uninvolving they reinforce the fact that the film cannot decide what its tone is meant to be. However, it is not until the final act, when the film attempts a twist that fails to, as Ryan Reynolds so elegantly puts it, make it make sense. In fact, as a result of this twist explanation for the rest of the film's events makes it make even less sense than it does thirty minutes in.As a result of these severe plot holes, editorial goofs, and comparisons to films that turned out so much greater, it is hard to see Smokin' Aces as anything but a monumental blunder. It is fortunate, then, that some solid performances from Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia keep the whole thing from dissolving into total disarray. In spite of a plot that frequently fails to make sense from a logical point of view, a small handful of actors keep the audience invested in caring about the fates of their characters. That is a feat that, in a film as messed up as is the case here, takes talent. The initial explanation of Buddy Israel's importance to the Mafia and FBI alike also does a great job of hooking the audience with a compelling and layered fable, but it also promises so much that the rest of the film does not deliver. Hence, Smokin' Aces is not quite the most frustrating film that I have watched in my lifetime, but I would definitely put it somewhere in the top ten. Considering how many previous attempts Joe Carnahan has made to create a masterpiece, I suspect this really is the best he is capable of. Which is a shame.I gave Smokin' Aces a five out of ten. It is a good film to show to students in direction and writing as they attempt to list all the things Carnahan gets wrong and right.",Smokin' Aces
70,jaredmobarak,Call the floristSmokin' Aces,8,27 January 2007,"The 2007 film lineup has finally begun for me. Sure I have seen many movies thus far, but they have all been holdovers from last year. Joe Carnahan's Smokin' Aces is definitely a fantastic opener and a hopeful sign of things to come. A mixture of high octane action with some very surprising, emotional moments and true dramatic worth, this all-star cast has some fun and allows the audience to just ride the wave with them. Something like this has a big tendency to taper off, yet Carnahan had a vision to jampack every insane idea he's had the past 3 years or so and really keeps the adrenaline flowing for almost the entire run-time.Our basic plot involves a huge operation that has been going on to destroy every last visage of the mafia. Everyone is pretty much behind bars except one last don, Primo Sparazza. The FBI believes they have their snitch to finally bring Primo in, and his name is Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, Las Vegas' performer of the year for the past five. This magician had worked his charm into the crime syndicate and had gotten himself in far too deep. So, basically we have the FBI trying to keep him alive until he agrees to rat out everyone, thus granting him witness protection, a bail bondsman and his ex-cop friends trying to extradite him for their employer, and seven hit-man for hire on the case to take him out for a million dollars from the crime boss. Primo is on his deathbed and he wants to see the rat gone before he expires with his heart as proof.Right from the start Carnahan has us inside the action. All exposition needed, to understand the circumstances, is given to us as each player receives it. In a nice stylistic move, the director cuts between everyone around the world getting ready to travel to Lake Tahoe for Israel, making all the conversation match up as though they are all talking to each other. This maneuver enlightens the audience, not only on the plot, but also on the background of each character. So, in turn, we learn all we need while the action continues to play out, never getting bored or slowed down by characters of power dictating stories and plot points. The action continues to build and build, as a result, until finally reaching the climatic rendezvous of everyone at the casino's penthouse room, housing Buddy.A movie of this caliber can only succeed as far as the characters being able to keep the pace fast. As a result we have a collection of some of the best actors working today each with a quick tongue and the dramatic chops to stay realistic. Jeremy Piven is brilliant as Israel, using the comedic wit that has vaulted him to where he is today. The sharp timing allows for some memorable one-liners with his crew and his showmanship in flashbacks really makes you believe he is a skilled magician. What really surprises and excites is his ability to steal scenes with his dramatic acting. His is a man who is beaten into submission mentally and must turn on those he has trusted for the past years of his life. Not being able to get up the illusion of his own composure, we are treated to some great scenes of him breaking down under the pressure. This truly is a Piven we have not seen before and the combination of seriousness and comedy hopefully will get him some great roles in the future. As for the other crazy characters, we have Jason Bateman so far from his ""Arrested Development"" role that it is hilarious to just look at him, not to mention the words that spew from his mouthpriceless; Ben Affleck and Peter Berg acting cool and collected while dragging their partner Martin Henderson along with them, the rapport between the three is nice; Taraji Henson and Alicia Keys (yes the singer) are brilliant as hitwomen on the case, talking racial politics and ripping on each other while being just plain badass; and the awesome Zach Cumer as a Ritalin- addled karate kid, so hyper and little that the dialogue and action he gives is some of the best comedy I've seen in awhile. I won't even mention the Tremor Brothers, as you must see them to believe them.The film is not all violence and laughter, though, as it has some phenomenal straight men to counteract the comedy. Common is surprisingly very calm and collected for his first film role, Ray Liotta is great as always, and Nestor Carbonell adds some nice villainy to the mix of cartoon caricature killers. The real standout in the entire movie, however, is Ryan Reynolds. Who would have thought that Van Wilder would have the acting prowess to pull off a complicated role like this? He is the only one involved that seems truly affected by the violence and carnage happening around him. You watch his character lose all the cool he had and emotionally breakdown while being left behind by his superiors in the bureau. Once the dénouement commenced and the film slowed to crawl, almost taking me out of the film completely with its ""I'm so clever"" twist, relayed by Andy Garcia with the worst fake accent I've ever heard, that subverted all the success the first three-quarters of runtime had, I was shaking my head in disgust. Thankfully Reynolds' stayed true to his evolution as a character and redeemed the horrible ending with a pitch-perfect finally shot.",Smokin' Aces
71,Victor Field,"""Smokin' Aces"" is neither smokin' nor ace.",2,27 January 2007,"Someone help me - has Ryan Reynolds ever been in a good movie? ""Blade: Trinity,"" ""The Amityville Horror"" and now ""Smokin' Aces,"" a nasty, brutish but sadly not short movie that isn't remotely as funny or as thrilling as it thinks it is. And it can forget about stylish either.Writer-director Joe Carnahan's bid to give the movie style is its biggest problem; an essentially simple story of the FBI, skiptracers and assassins all after a Las Vegas entertainer-turned-snitch (Jeremy Piven) is subjected to endless stretching out, fantastically annoying touches - way too many connecting scenes have one sentence carried over to another, there are far too many characters and too few of them given any room to grow, and moments that want to be quirky but just grate (why do we have to see Jason Bateman wearing women's underwear? What is the point of a small boy giving karate chops and getting an erection?) - and utter, utter stupidity; ""Smokin' Aces"" is the kind of movie where three bad guys who look like a punk rock group manage to get into a hotel without anyone seeing them.Meanwhile, while Carnahan's indulging himself (note how many of the scenes go on longer than necessary, like Matthew Fox's cameo) the movie's few moments of interest are lost, and the actors are left struggling with their receptacles for profanity - as opposed to proper characters. All of which makes the movie both hypercharged and boring; it just doesn't matter whether or not they get to Piven's character, you just find yourself wanting to say ""Oh for goodness' sake just END already."" On the upside, Ben Affleck is pretty good in his glorified cameo (before getting abruptly killed off) and Alicia Keys does quite well as a sultry lesbian assassin. (Her contribution is entirely acting-related.) The movie's ultimate payoff would also probably be more effective had the movie been shorter, or better developed.But since it ain't, all this movie is is, as Chief Wiggum once said, ""Lots of flash - no depth.""",Smokin' Aces
72,hall895,"No plot, no point, no hope",4,5 September 2011,"Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is a big-shot Las Vegas magician with mob connections. When the feds close in Buddy cuts a deal, agreeing to spill mob secrets. Unsurprisingly this does not go over well with the mob. So a price is put on Buddy's head. Or more accurately on his heart. Yes, mob boss Primo Sparazza wants Buddy's heart. That's apparently one very angry mobster. As Buddy holes up in a Lake Tahoe penthouse suite a widely disparate collection of assassins descends on the hotel determined to collect the cash. There are also a couple of FBI agents as well as a team of bail bondsmen looking to collect Buddy alive and in one piece. Inevitably everything comes together in an over-the-top orgy of violence and the movie ends. Unfortunately the movie doesn't end nearly soon enough. Sitting though this entire movie really tries the patience.The movie has a threadbare plot which is stretched way beyond the breaking point. There's not nearly enough of a story here to hold the interest all the way through. The key character of Buddy, the guy this whole thing is about, is woefully underdeveloped. We never learn much of anything about him and thus never really have any reason to care what happens to him. From the fleeting glimpses we get of him the only conclusion we can draw is that the guy's a jerk and we really wouldn't terribly mind seeing his heart ripped out. The assassins are a largely bizarre collection of individuals, some too bizarre to take at all seriously. Speaking of bizarre if you don't already completely hate the movie just wait until the world's most annoying karate kid shows up. You'll certainly hate the movie then. About as stupid as it gets right there. Really the only characters to come away with any credit at all are the FBI agents, played by Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta, and their boss, played by Andy Garcia. As a young actor looking to make his mark you can see why Reynolds might have taken a chance on this movie. But you would have thought Liotta and Garcia would have known better. Did they not read the script? After the final bloodbath in which huge guns aren't enough, chainsaws are required, that lousy script has some more unpleasant surprises. After having really no story whatsoever to that point the movie finally tries to inject a little plot with a twist that makes no sense, is incredibly stupid, and fails miserably. At this point you realize the whole movie was built on a foundation of sand and the whole thing collapses. In truth though this movie fell apart long before the lousy ending. Not much of anything nice to say about this one.",Smokin' Aces
73,fwomp,Some Things Can Trump Aces...,8,26 August 2007,"This film is one of those guilty pleasures. Sexy ladies, blood splatter, guns a-blazing, and action sequences galore.But it's also much more than that. Jeremy Piven isn't really known as a lead actor. His drug-addled yet funny portrayal in GROSSE POINT BLANK (beside lead actor John Cusack) cemented him as a powerfully funny if somewhat despicable character, and this is something he uses to great advantage in SMOKIN' ACES.The story is that of Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Piven), a Vegas magician turned mobster who's out to get as much recognition and cash as he can and be damned the consequences. But when a hit is put out on him  and he learns of it  Buddy turns to the Feds for a deal; he plans to tell all of what he knows regarding mob business in Nevada before someone rips his heart out (both figuratively and literally).Enter agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta, WILD HOGS), two G-men assigned to protect Buddy and take him out of his Lake Tahoe safe-haven and into protective custody.In the meantime, the contract on Buddy's life has gotten great notice by those in the rub-out business (the price tag on Buddy's head is $1 million). A trio of demented and toothless brothers with a penchant for bloody ends, a master of disguise, two sexy ladies with some powerful guns, and even an unfortunate bounty hunter (played by Ben Affleck, HOLLYWOODLAND) get involved to no good ends.Eventually the deal with Buddy falls through, and the FBI renigs on its offer of protection, leaving Buddy wide-open to his newfound enemies. Unbeknownst to our two G-men, they come into Buddy's hotel with some hit men (and women) in front and behind them. Blood is sure to fly, and it does with little remorse and plenty of abandon.The big question is why did the FBI pull out its offer of protection. Old FBI plans and super-duper secret undercover cases come boiling back and threaten to spill over onto everyone's lap, especially onto Messner's who has to deal with the death of someone close to him and the possibility of corruption from within the very department he's dedicated his life to.It is Jeremy Piven's who carries a large part of Smokin' Aces. His sexually depraved and drug sniffing personae was spot-on and made watchers both love and loathe him in the same breath. We despise him, but love how he handles the terribleness of his new situation.This is definitely a great film to watch when you're in the mood for the spray of crimson and shoot 'em up action.",Smokin' Aces
74,joebloggscity,Complex but enthralling multiple contract killer film...,7,14 January 2007,"Smoking Aces is a film that tries hard, and in doing so is one that is not going to be easy to describe. The basic plot revolves around the central character ""Aces"" who is testifying against the mob, and in return has a contract out on his head. Locked away in his suite in Las Vegas, he is protected by the Fed, but there are multiple contract killers (all different from each as can be imagined!) out to get him.First hour seems to be stuck piecing the different contract killers together and their background, whilst the Fed are shown to be trying to figure out what is going on. No one set of actors though gets above the others, and in doing so you have multiple stories in the film tied into the whole premise of the film. Acting is great by the general assemble which includes fine performances by Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta.Problematically, the film tries to be too cool at the start, and reminds me too much of ""Things to do in Denver...."" and so on. In addition, the film is really confusing at points but is worth persevering with nevertheless. The complexity makes it very original, and you never know where its going, but it wraps up together in the last 30mins which are more than worth the cinema ticket alone.No classic, but enjoyable, original and interesting overall..",Smokin' Aces

With chopped-up bits of OUT OF SIGHT and THE USUAL SUSPECTS sprinkled inside for 'flava'? SMOKIN' ACES wants so badly to tap into the cool/hip factor of all three of those films, and therein lies the problem. Tarantino, Soderbergh and Singer already made those movies, so why make them again? Well, Joe's butt is certainly saved by the movie's biggest redeeming factor, and that's a game cast.Though there are some considerable twists and turns leading to a ""shocking"" ending that most of the audience I saw it with found completely confusing, the performances certainly helped temporarily cover up some of the Mack truck-sized plot holes.Look, if you want something that's loud, dumb, bloody, amoral and just fun to watch, you already know to check your brain at the door before you walk into this one. Leave it there, don't try to hash this out, and you'll be fine.About all you'll need to know going in is what the previews have already pounded into our subconscious with a ball-peen hammer: Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven), after becoming a ""mob mascot"" and something of a B-list crime figure himself, wants out of 'the life', and to achieve that goal, he's ready to testify against his old cronies for the Feds. That's when Buddy's ex-mentor, the Don of Las Vegas himself, Primo Sperazza (Joseph Ruskin) decides that the former show palace magician would look better imitating a bloody human wheel of Swiss cheese.He puts out a million-dollar hit on Israel with one stipulation: the successful assassin who completes the job must bring the stoolie's heart back as proof. Word gets out about the contract, and now every degenerate kind of bounty hunter, contract killer and just plain psychotic loonies are out to collect on the offer. So, think of this as IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD KILLING SPREE, with a more modern cast.For my money, the best (and funniest) standouts were Ryan Reynolds, reaching far beyond sophomoric comedies and glossy horror movie remakes with a performance that goes from drolly comic to explosively dramatic; Alicia Keys with Taraji Henson, who both play ""smoov"" streetwise hit women with a natural ease that the majority of the cast should take note of; Jason Bateman in a role that's far different from anything he's ever done before, (and that includes his career-topping turn on ""Arrested Development"") and Matthew Fox, completely trashing his heartthrob image on ""LOST"" by sporting big '80's hair that would make even Barry Gibb cringe.If you feel you must redeem yourself after having spent two hours on this, go see PAN'S LABYRINTH.

76,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Entertaining, if at times down right bizarre.",7,14 February 2007,"The FBI is on the verge of bringing down a huge crime syndicate and all they need is the testimony of one key witness. The problem is that the crime boss that they are trying to bring down announces a one million dollar contract on that vital witness. Various underworld parties vie for the prize and things may be more complicated than initially perceived.The black-comedy crime caper seems to be a genre all by itself by now. Lots of violence, lots of profanity, stylish visual direction and plot twists. ""Smokin' Aces"" is a decent example of just that. It is nothing stellar or classic, but it is pretty entertaining. There is a share of cliché here, but it is masked by the film's pacing, style and humor as well as some originality. That primarily comes from the characters some of which are down right bizarre. Also Jeremy Piven's role as Buddy Israel, the key witness, is much better than expected for an action/black comedy flick as this.However, the action comedy bits is also what throws the movie off a little. Some scenes are just plain old grim and really bloody. One of these scenes involving a chainsaw comes like a freight train out of nowhere. So the film is part comedy, part action, part violent excess, and part plot driven thriller - a bit of hodge-podge to be very good or feel complete in any one part. However the entertainment value makes it a fun movie overall. --- 7/10Rated R for strong violence and profanity",Smokin' Aces
77,jpschapira,The worst kind of bad,2,27 August 2007,"""Smokin' Aces"" is the worst kind of bad movie. It has a lousy argument which is badly executed; it has a huge number of characters that serve no purpose for this argument; it tries to be of several different genres and succeeds at none; it is poorly written, uncaringly directed, horribly lit and scored; it's not involving at all and I haven't even started.There are also several reasons why this film about a snitch (Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, played a bit over the top by Jeremy Piven) wanted by every individual in the world, waiting to be found and killed by a million people at the same time, while he's basically killing himself is worse than the worst television series; but we'll get to that. If you read that little plot explanation, that's nothing: it changes all the time, confuses even the characters themselves and makes no effort to keep the viewer informed.The characters are introduced by big letters on the screen and even when these are the important ones, we don't remember any of them but the freakin' ""Aces"" because everyone longs for a piece of his flesh. The big story also has smaller subplots and they are presented in a very bad use of flashbacks and we don't get nor care for any of them. Near the end, the movie goes back on a flashback and performs a twist (don't worry, you will not anticipate it): it's the most senseless and forced twist I've seen this year; and it's backed by a dramatic score (because it's a dramatic part of the film) to accentuate the momentI don't know but I think that's when ""Smokin' Aces"" goes beyond completely ridiculous and looses it. But don't get me wrong about the scoreIt's not bad because it sounds bad; it's bad because it doesn't know and where to put the sound.What I think makes the picture even more lame is that it actually believes it is achieving all of this dimensions: it believes in its embarrassing drama, in its false complexity and its action that doesn't generate anything (well, one loud shot did); and it believes in its inexistent timing for putting them all together. Talking about timing, the sense of time in this movie is worse thanYes! The worst television series. During one moment, two guys are going up an elevator of twelve floors; the camera changes and for five minutes we don't see the guysWhen we see them again, they still haven't reached the penthouseCome on! Moments like are all over the place.And not only there's no sense of time in the film, but also no sense of style. I'm not going to make a whole ""trying to be like Tarantino"" speech, but recently I saw ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and the use of cameras was perfect and stylish, and the deaths looked good. Never have I seen so many people killed for no reason and done with no style as in ""Smokin' Aces"".I haven't got to the part where I explain the wasted talent this movie contains, but I'm going to skip that because it's really shameful; and I'm just going to say the best thing in the film is a singer and Jason Bateman. You check out the cast for yourselves and do the math.The movie was directed and written by Joe CarnahanI'm so sorry for you man.",Smokin' Aces
78,deatman9,not bad but very convoluted.,5,28 May 2012,This movie was not all bad. It had a list of pretty good actors throughout and it had some OK action scenes. This movie really fell out for me though because the story kept going one way then the other. Its feels very convoluted and sloppy.This movie is about a bounty put on this mans head who has information that will put a crime boss behind bars. So criminal mercenaries from all over go out in search for this guy.They all manage to find him at the exact place at the exact time. So it ends up being a huge conflict between all the criminals as a couple of fbi agents try to rescue him.This movie in my opinion is not worth watching. Its confusing and all over the place not very well made.,Smokin' Aces
79,oneloveall,Just sit back and enjoy the convoluted carnage,7,16 April 2007,"Going into Joe Carnahan's follow up from the engagingly gritty Narc with this apparently flashy, over-stylistic ensemble piece highlighting a group of wacky hit men (and women) of all varieties duking it out for bounty gold, expectations were at a mediocre best. I am happy to say those expectations have been impressively surpassed. In Smokin' Aces, the plot, script, even certain shots, locales and characters reek of third-generation borrowing. It is as if the writer/director wanted to put his thumb print on the youth market, creating a potential cult hit by capturing, in heavily measured mannerisms, so many aspects of the popular violent hipster cinema young male adults have gravitated towards the past 15 years. It is a credit to Mr. Carnahan himself then, that this film rises way above the derivative sum of it's parts and becomes one of the more entertaining and fast paced action movies of the year.Essentially, it all boils down to one glorious showdown in Vegas, a true True Romance of a climax if there ever was one. Carnahan may have been a tad overambitious in his script trying to get us all situated to the tense face-off, but I'll admire detailed effort over bland coasting any day. Everyone knows from the first minute, nay, opening text, that this will be an overdone movie with script indulgences, so there should be no harm in giving that your all. Piling heaping upon layer of elaborative setup, the plot-intensive, purposely confusing screenplay may fly halfway around many action-craving viewers until all mayhem breaks through late in the game (Be warned, all desiring a blood-fest throughout may remain disappointed by all the mechanical buildup leading into the late action). Anyone would be able to enjoy Smokin' Aces simply based on the centerpiece shootout if it is high energy, bullet slinging battles they want, but without absorbing all or at least most of the convoluted sub-plots and back stories that are whisked through the finely calibrated work, a certain tension would fall flat. Which is not to say everything in this script is to be mulled over either! As long as viewers recognize the tone the script was going for (something I admit he struggled with late in the film) the absurd characters and situations are fitted with a precise entertaining accuracy that puts this guy miles above pretty much all who try to emulate this style.So sit back and enjoy the excess. With a group as varied as it's multi-colored cover art, sometimes the casting seems a little superficial (Alicia Keys), some take the project a little too seriously (Andy Garcia with yet another laughable accent) but mostly, the cast can be seen having a wickedly fun time that you know this shoot must have been -Jeremy Piven and Jason Bateman in particular steal the show with their madcap performances, let's not forget the fabulous cave-man charisma a delightfully dim trio playing the Tremor brothers exude, and Ryan Reynolds in the key role maintains an intense presence throughout the spectacularly silly affair). All in all if you are young enough to appreciate the visceral stupidity behind much of this mayhem, old enough to pay attention to the unnecessarily detailed script, and free of enough cynicism to not let any bitterness convince you that this is unoriginal tripe, Smokin' Aces is a highly successful guilty pleasure of an over-the-top action flick, paying worthy homage to some of popular cinema's more noticeably hip violence in a very competent and assured delivery.",Smokin' Aces
80,Carycomic,All the violence of CASINO ROYALE in half the time.,6,28 January 2007,"And, that is why I score this movie one figure higher than CASINO ROYALE.But, if the truth be told, this movie was more similar to the story of George Clooney's character in OUT OF SIGHT. Except Jeremy Piven is playing a criminal ex-magician with delusions of grandeur, rather than an egotistical bank robber. And, the cut-aways and flashbacks are far less frequent (Thank you, Lord!).Furthermore, there is a major plot twist involving the dying mob boss, Sparazza. It's glaringly obvious what the big secret is that Andy Garcia (as Asst. Director Locke) discovers. Yet, in keeping with the theme of magic, it misdirects you by centering your attention on how soon Agents Carruthers and/or Messner will discover it. Rather than have you concentrate on the real plot twist involving the mysterious Swede.On the downside, though? The oft-mentioned Agent Heller is described as having served in the O.S.S. (Office of Strategic Services) before joining the FBI. This would seem to indicate that Heller was a World War Two veteran, if for no other reason than the O.S.S. (forerunner of today's CIA) did not exist prior to June 1942.And, yet, Asst. Director Locke later claims that Heller's undercover operation (and I quote) ""PRE-DATED WWII.""

81,bopdog,"Much style, little substance. Mimics Tarantino and others.",6,15 January 2007,"'Smokin' Aces' has lots of style--- in fact, it reminded me of a Quenton Tarantino, Elmor Leonard kind of thing. Sort of like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Get Shorty', in the vibe, if not the actual set-up.The cast is first rate. And there are moments of movie-making skill. Certainly it is competent throughout, in fact it's probably 'pretty good' throughout. The thing is, does all that style add up to much? Maybe I'm too cynical, or am being too hard to please? But it seemed to me that a weakness of the movie was, in fact, its style. That is, because I kept noticing its Tarantino vibe, instead of being simply immersed in THIS movie--- maybe 'Smokin' Aces' was a bit of a trifle? A bit of a meringue, a fluffy piece of directorial muscle-flexing? I don't mean to say it is in any way bad. After all, a well done style exercise is hard to do, and it IS a statement of sorts. But by the end of the movie I was kind of not caring who lived or died.After 27 gun battles, some more, and some less, implausible than the others, I was certainly inured to the violence. I kind of didn't care any more. And that goes for the whole movie. At the end, I went, 'Hmmm. Yawn... got to get to the car park and get my car now'. A more impacting and meaningful movie would have had me pondering SOMETHING--- either the movie itself, or life, or hoodlums, or cops, or human ambition, or whatever.Some of the implausibilities are easily written off and forgiven as literary or artistic license. Hey, it IS just a movie, and some goofy stunts in the name of entertainment are fine. But some of them were silly to the point of being stupid, and distracting, like a kids' cartoon. For example, at one point a sniper is firing a BAR .50 cal rifle from the 15th floor of a high-rise hotel into the heroes' floor in the hotel next door. Fine. But then half a dozen FBI agents simply whip out their 9 mm pistols and blindly start blasting back, some of them shielding their eyes from flying glass, as they duck and dive to hide from the sniper's bullets. They are shooting blindly, some from over their shoulders, some from around their backs, ALL without aiming. And all of them were also shooting directly into the exposed windows of a 20-storey hotel, endangering hundreds of civilians. That just would NOT ever happen in the real world. Ever! Yet there were several such scenes in 'Smokin' Aces'.Small complaints, to be sure. But those, and other, gross illogicalities did distract me from believing in the scenes and the movie's story. And then, toward the end, when we are told the real reason for the interest in the Aces character-- I won't reveal it here, but it was so slim and implausible that the whole movie world kind of collapsed for me, and no longer made sense. It became a silly and half-baked fantasy of a movie idea, rather than a finished and professional movie project.So, bottom line: a well made, but ordinary, movie. Good escapism, if you can handle extreme violence, but nothing to provoke, or invoke, anything deeper or more meaningful than the 2 hours of the movie itself. I gave this a 6 out of 10, rather than an 8 or so, for being vapid.",Smokin' Aces

The film is shot in a way that might make it a bit hard to watch and confusing, but if one follows the intricate plot, i think carnahan has effectively weaved a good mafia/crime caper flick. I liked Piven here, as he hardly doesn't impress in mye eyes, but Reynolds was also very good, and is starting to grow on me (Van Wilder is stepping it up) and Ray Liotta was good as well. Overall i guess my one complaint was that some of the dialogues seemed a bit unnatural, but other than that it was very good and its one of those films i could watch again. IMDb Rating: 6.6. My Rating: 9/10",Smokin' Aces
83,DonFishies,"Stylistically well done, but the storyline just ends up being ridiculous",6,26 January 2007,"Watching the Smokin' Aces trailer recently, I was reminded a lot of last year's Lucky Number Slevin, which had style, smart-ass dialogue, and an intriguing storyline that ultimately failed on the whole. Of course, I held hope that Smokin' Aces, which appeared to have all of that as well, would be better. Unfortunately, it disappoints in the majority of those categories.The basic storyline of Aces is that Las Vegas lounge-act turned wannabe mobster Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven) has fallen under hard times. The FBI wants him to testify in a high profile case against one of the key members of the Las Vegas chapters of the mafia, Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). Sparraza, a friend and fan of Israel is less than pleased, and even worse in his health. So he calls in an assassin to kill Israel, and offers a million dollars to do so. Only thing is, other hit men, bail bondsmen and the FBI themselves want their hands on the guy first.This is the basic setup of the film, and is what is present in all of the marketing materials for the film. The opening twenty minutes sets this entire arch up, and introduces all of the players trying to get their greedy hands on Israel. But that is where the film stops being what it says it is, and completely changes direction (much like Slevin). Almost out of the blue, bizarre subplots begin to appear and completely change the film's thrilling race to the finish into something of that borders on becoming downright silly. The film turns into a drama about halfway through, and then tries to jump back and forth between that and being the action movie it made itself out to be. While Slevin at least stayed consistent with its characters and the direction it takes itself, Aces begins bringing in scenes and characters that are totally uncalled for, have the stench of being filler material and just end up becoming superfluous in the end.Joe Carnahan, the writer/director of the film, just seems totally unsure of what he wants to do here. Does he want it to be a non-stop thrill ride all the way to the ultimate finish of killing Israel? Or did that just seem too simple of an idea? Changing the movie to stop being about the ultimate goal of murdering Israel and collecting the one million dollar reward, but still focusing heavily on the hit men (and women) trying to knock him off just does not jive in the grand scheme of things. Hell, even after the hit men are out of the picture (either by death or making it out alive) and the film just becomes a fifteen minute explanation of the repercussions of everyone's actions, it just feels ripped out of another movie. It does not feel like it should have ever been a part of this one, and just stands out as almost totally nulling and voiding everything we had just seen before hand. It is an interesting story, but it just feels like it could have been written a whole lot better.As a result of the bogus screenplay, the characters really suffer. It is not that the performances are not very good, but just the fact that there are too many to keep track of, and their screen time decreases significantly as the movie goes on. It does not help either that you can barely identify or really get to know any of the characters, as the majority of them do not make it to the very end. Neither does the fact that the humour does not stay consistently throughout, but only pops up here and there. What does appear is blocked out in many cases by the blaring soundtrack.But the actors do their best with the little material they are given, and really attempt to be memorable. The hit men all have quirks, and they are all played out very well. Some may feel a bit overexagerated (like the nutty Neo-Nazis), but they all work out for the most part. Piven as Israel is a particular standout, as he does really good playing the strung out and defeated object of attention. His character is the only one who really gets explored; so watching him chew through the scenery makes for some great sequences. Ryan Reynolds is another standout as FBI Agent Messner, who ends up carrying the film through its last act and does a great job showcasing off the emotions that are going to win more than just critical acclaim one day.If the acting is not all that bad, then the thing that really shines are the visuals. The colours and actual set designs shown throughout are elaborate and well documented on the camera. They feel like more attention was given to them than the screenplay had. The editing is great as well, jumping from scene to scene with ease and sense. Unlike other recent action films (such as Domino), this one does not just jump randomly in an attempt to fulfill the wishes of someone with ADD. It stays on certain scenes just long enough, and cuts away at the perfect times (save for a scene involving a ""karate kid"" for lack of better terminology, where the camera dwindles a bit too long). It helps amp up the style of the film, and somewhat adds to the desire of its watchability. The graphic violence is also handled rather well, being gratuitous without quite being totally gratuitous. It felt tastefully done, with a hint of brutality here and there.On the whole, Aces is stylistically great and has some fairly well done performances. The overall story has a lot of issues, and on the whole, ends up being more ridiculous than anyone can possibly think it would have been. It is watchable, but should not be a high priority on anyone's list. Slevin is a lot better.6/10.",Smokin' Aces
84,nathanmanson,Good concept not very well executed,4,5 April 2020,I thought the concept for the film was really good and intriguing but in my opinion just was executed as well as it could've been.

85,rajdoctor,Smoking Aces,5,3 February 2007,"Smoking Aces Smoking Aces has reminisces of the film director  Joe Carnaham's earlier movie ""Blood, Gut, Bullets and Octane"" and an obvious inspiration from Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"". This blend results in a thin story line of good guys trying to protect a witness and bad guys trying to kill him packed with weirdo characters, twists and turns, over-laps of parallel events, moments just to shock the audiences, and lastly a suspense and a twist. Does not this sound a familiar formula for a try to make a ""Cult"" movie? Smoking Aces is all that. It is evident that Joe Carnaham looks desperate to make a cult movie that would be remembered as a classic. Does he succeed? Not really! But I should say that the attempt is good and could had been much more better  if there was a bit of restraint shown in every department of movie making; starting from the characters, make-up, sound, camera work, twist and turns, blood and gory.The star cast is appealing to watch  Ben Affleck, Andy Gracia and Alicia Keys are names I know and I think will attract crowds. But there are about 15 other characters in the movie. The first quarter of the movie is just set to unveil this cast and the story line.When I went to see the movie I had no idea of what the movie is about and that is why with so many characters  it took some time to figure out what is the story heading at. But once in the driver's seat  knowing the journey, the ride was a roller coaster one.The suspense in the end was a bit over-board and looked stupid and far-fetched.But yet, I think it is not a bad movie. It has some credits to attract some sections who love this type of movies. There are some minor editing skips that could have been helped to hide some camera angles on screen and timing of over-lapping events.While I am writing this review I am intrigue by the question  will this movie be remembered or become a cult classic? I think not! But the audience through year's memory has the final say to make a cult classic and I will live it to them to tell me what they think.(5.5 Stars)",Smokin' Aces

Yes, there is not a well-thought-out plot, but the action scenes turned out to be excellent. The ending is predictable, the main twist is read in the first half of the story.

87,Mr_Sensitive,Fail to Delivered,4,18 March 2008,"Well there is two side to this movie either you like the action and hate the story or you find everything in this movie is an utterly mess. I find everything in this movie to be an utterly mess. Good thing is there are loads of star to look at and they do give out a pretty decent performance.Synopsis: Buddy Israel is a wanted man, from the authority, and from every hit man as his price has gone up to 1 millions as the mob learns that he is turning against them to the FBI.At first I decide to ignore the negative review and decide to go straight to DVD. Now though did not fell fully rob but maybe I can buy the other movie that I like instead. I thought the movie was going to be like The Big Hit or Crank, I think the maker also think that it will be like that but he fail. This is not a non-stop action driven movie, this is a good wannabe. It was like the movie is neither this nor that.Smoking’s Ace doesn’t have true identity; I managed to get that past 1 hour mark of the movie to see something actually happening. In that first one hour there is only talking, setting up plans and introducing each character. Well this is not a series; you can not take 60 % of your movie introducing them selves, and what up with the complicated words and storyline? It doesn’t make this movie any cooler or look more professional, it was just complicated and hard to understand, it was really unnecessary.The story is totally inconsistence, the last 45 min parts of the movie, I get to see all the action, and that is when the word “fun” is seen. It was not stylish or anything just dozen of contract killers and FBI tries to kill each other. There isn’t much of adrenalin rush at all as I was hoping for.What I like the most and probably the only thing that attract the people to watch was the casting. It was truly out pass the movie. But I love Ace Israel the most, his character is the most complex and by far the best acting in the movie. Jeremy Piven gave is good bring out the best of Ace. Ryan Reynolds was also good.Like most of this type of movie there are some part that is humorous, unfortunately this movie seem a little force. Overall, it was so-so, the directing is kinda annoying at time, but still alright, but it was the inconsistence of the movie that drags it down. It was fun, but I do not plan to watch it again, I will wrap it up and send it for my cousin as birthday gift.Recommendation: Not Truly Bad, But … Just Skip It.Reason to Watch: Hollywood Stars of all ages.Reason Not To: Utterly messy story.Rating: 4.5/10 (Grade: D-) Please Rate Y/N only after read.",Smokin' Aces

89,Antagonisten,Not bad,6,2 July 2007,"The movies that are always the most difficult to review are the ones that are not bad, but that still has something missing to them. ""Smokin' Aces"" is definitely like that. While it's not a bad movie, it's still far from as good as it could have been.I think the movie started out pretty well. It's got an almost ""Lock Stock""-like quality to it where it presents all the main characters in different sequences. After that you feel the stage is set and the guns loaded. Unfortunately then you get the first dip in pace, and the movie never really recovers. Sure, you get a few laughs and some pretty well-done action scenes. But the pace really never picks up and lives up to the promise of the beginnings.It's difficult for me to put my finger on why i didn't really like this movie. Like i said before it's not bad and it was fairly entertaining. Perhaps my expectations were wrong? I expected something more fast-paced and hysterical, while this is a lot more sombre in pace. The good points are the actors, not that they're great but most of them are pretty good in their parts and many of them are quite funny. Also the action scenes are pretty well done. The negative parts is that i would have liked more action, a quicker pace and a lot less bewildering ending (without giving anything away).I think most people who like action movies might like this one. It works pretty well, although there are quite a lot of things to improve. I give it a 6/10.",Smokin' Aces
90,the-movie-guy,"If you like mayhem and carnage, this is a movie to see",6,24 January 2007,"(My Synopsis) Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, (Jeremy Piven), is a self-indulgent headliner magician at the MGM's main ballroom who grew up inside the Las Vegas mob, headed by mob boss, Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). ""Aces"" is a wannabe gangster who believes he has the brains to start his own gang and become his own mob boss. This move doesn't sit well with the real mob boss, who places a $1,000,000 contract on ""Aces"". When the contract hits the street, it brings out all sorts of psychopathic killers from around the country. ""Aces"" needs protection, so he is willing to turn state's evidence against the mob in return for witness protection and not going to prison. In the meantime, ""Aces"" is having a party with 5 prostitutes in the penthouse suite of the Nomad Casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. ""Ace's"" location must be an open secret, because all the hit men ascend to Lake Tahoe and converge on the penthouse to cash in on a big payday.(My Comment) This movie has a lot of stars (Ben Affleck, Ray Liotta, Andy Garcia, Ryan Reynolds, and Alicia Keys) usually with little screen time. The movie has a lot of action with a large body count by the end. The plot is far fetched with some strange characters. There are some scenes that are a little extreme and hard to believe, even for a movie. Some of the battles between the hit men/women and the FBI/police would not happen that way in the real world. The FBI/police would not endanger civilians by shooting into the windows of the hotel across the street without having a specific target. Besides, they were out of range with the small weapons they had (guns and shotguns). There is another scene where the armed hotel security personnel are in front of a smoking elevator waiting for the door to open and a trio of neo-Nazi hit men exit with guns and chainsaw and the security people don't open fire, unbelievable. The biggest flaw of the movie was the poorly written script that was a little hard to follow, too complex, and made no sense. The twist at the end was just bizarre. However, if you like mayhem and carnage with a bloodbath, this is one to see. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:48, Rated R)(6/10)",Smokin' Aces
91,MichaelMargetis,Action-Packed but Seriously Lacking in Plot,5,21 November 2007,"Hollis Elmore: Eh, f_ck this. There's no doubt about it, 'Smoking Aces' is a very entertaining film, but a good film? I don't think so. Take a huge complex plot that isn't very plausible and add a sh__t load of gun play, explosions and action, and you get 'Smokin' Aces', the new film by Joe Carnahan. The best thing about 'Smokin' Aces' was the practically non-stop action. The acting wasn't half bad either. The film is filled with very capable actors but none really get a chance to show off their abilities because the film isn't about the characters. It's about a couple of guys getting shot to death in an elevator or one hit man falling on a running chainsaw. If that's what you are looking for, I highly recommend 'Smokin' Aces', but if you are looking for something with a bit more substance -- you may be disappointed. The closest thing to a great performance in Smokin' Aces comes from 'Entourage' star Jeremy Piven, who nails the role of the obnoxious, sleazy, coked-out Vegas magician whom all the hit men in the movie are after. Piven is basically playing a grittier version of Ari Gold, and there is no doubt in my mind Carnahan based the character off of Piven's character Ari on Entourage while writing the screenplay. The film takes a couple of unexpected turns but for the most part it's sadly predictable. The dialogue is cheesy for the most part, but tries desperately to be innovative and quirky. Note to Mr. Carnahan -- you aren't Quentin Tarantino, so stop pretending to be. 'Smokin' Aces' is no Pulp Fiction, that's for f__cking sure. The ending I admit, or the final twist if you will, is unexpected, but it's completely ridiculous and far-fetched. Personally, I found Carnahan's last film 'Narc', a unsettling and gritty cop drama set in Detroit, to be a far better film. Actually, 'Narc' was one of the best cop films I've seen. 'Narc' sported top-notch acting and realistic dialogue, which is why I'm surprised with how cheesy and let's face it, stupid, 'Smokin' Aces' is at some parts. In conclusion, 'Smokin' Aces' isn't a bad film, it's actually very entertaining if you like this sort of shoot 'em up stuff. It just isn't a good film, but it's better than most of the crap that's been released this year. Grade: C+",Smokin' Aces
92,danielmanson,It just was not for me,4,4 April 2020,"I'm gonna start by saying I understand why some people would enjoy this film, but not for me and here's why:
First 10 minutes it absolutely blasts through the plot and characters, there's also a ton of characters to remember! And ultimately forget a lot of it because of how fast paced it all is.
Literally all characters have zero back story or anything, so when they die I couldn't give a toss. I didn't understand half of them either of their purpose in the film. Why are they acting like they are? Etc
It's just too complicated and it didn't need to be at all. This would work as a simple action film, but the direction it went in and the ending was so confusing.Positives?
The actual action scenes were really good, cinematography and music was also great and the overall violence shown was something I enjoyed. But beyond that this just was not for me!",Smokin' Aces
93,ClaytonDavis,It's an Ace,8,21 May 2007,"Smokin' Aces Smokin' Aces, I must say is one of the most clever, original action films I've viewed in a while. The film wasn't done in terms of editing and such but there was some great potential to come with it. This film leads an all-star cast ranging from Ryan Reynolds, Ray Liotta, Ben Affleck, Jeremy Piven, Peter Berg, Alicia Keys, Taraji P. Henson, Andy Garcia, and much more. This film is a multi-character story with many story lines going on, much like Ocean's Eleven but meets Lethal Weapon and comes out Aces. At the center of the story is ""Buddy 'Aces' Israel,"" played by Jeremy Piven, who was a Las Vegas performer turned mafia apprentice decides to turn in evidence and give all the information about his new buddies in open court and testify but not if Primo Sparazza, the head of all the mafia can help it. He puts out a $1,000,000 bounty on Israel's life and here enters many multi-fascinating characters. Liotta and Reynolds play F.B.I. agents racing against the clock to get to Israel and protect him before everyone else does. And the rest of the supporting cast is a bunch of different gangs of thugs and misfits trying to kill Israel for some money. We take this journey with them throughout the film and it becomes one of the best rides of the year.First of all, this film takes many turns throughout its approximate one hour and forty-five minutes of time. It starts off very confusing giving the audience a premise of what each character is up to and what their motives are. I couldn't follow that first fifteen minutes from anything and do you know why? Because it was being explained by one of the worst actors working today, Ben Affleck, who gets the worst in show honor. He only has about ten minutes or so of screen time but every moment he was on screen I started to wonder why do I watch films if all directors are going to do is hire a face and not at the very least voice train the man. His delivery is off tone and he possesses no character traits to give into the character he is playing. He's just the best friend from ""Good Will Hunting"" over and over and over again. I guess our Hollywoodland performance was a once in a lifetime shot.Phew, now that I have that out the wayThe performances except for Affleck are fantastic. So is there Oscar in the future for the ""Aces""? Well, would you believe me if I said there were Oscar worthy performances coming from two of the most unlikely in the cast. How about Ryan Reynolds for a supporting nomination? He plays an F.B.I. agent so well and unlike any I've seen before and at a very important twist in the film the audience witnesses his character come to life and brings us into a character downward spiral. Thanks to a sample score from ""Requiem for a Dream"" thrown in there it added greatly to the tone of the film and Reynolds brilliant performance and crowned this film a true gem. I couldn't believe my eyes when I was watching him. ""Van Wilder"" giving a performance that no one could have ever expected. If this can't be a nomination then this could be a huge stepping stone for him into some more serious, dramatic roles. He could very much be invited to a ceremony one day.The other best in show comes from ""Mr. Gordon Prichard"" a.k.a. ""Cheese"" a.k.a. for none of you Old School fans, Jeremy Piven. His dramatic-comedic turn as ""Aces"" is the best of his career. He is amazing and gets a laugh and a chuckle almost every time. He's a vivid scene stealer from his other cast mates and would be a lovely and different kind of contender to add to the race. ""Aces"" has so much going on inside him and we can't encompass all of him in a few sentences. You see the character come alive in his bodily movements, tears (yes I said tears) and everything else that could make a character three-dimensional.Like I said before, the cast is large and it's hard to pick other standouts but Alicia Keys surprisingly was very good in her first big screen role. Taraji P. Henson kept the ""Hustle and Flow"" broken woman image throughout the film which she better break away from quick before she becomes a type cast actress; we know she has a bit too much talent for that to happen. Liotta, Berg, Garcia, and rapper Common were all decent but nothing too exciting worth mentioning.A ""realistic"" nomination that I could foresee would be an Original Screenplay nomination for Joe Carnahan whom is best known for penciling the underrated ""Narc"" back in 2002. He both writes and directs this film and if the critics embrace the film and we can get a good campaign out of Universal with maybe a nomination in the Musical/Comedy category at the Globes than we could have a good thing on our hands. But just look at that list; a lot need to happen for this to get picked up. There is one flaw of the film though and it is in the screenplay and it's just the wrapping of all the loose ends. It becomes a little hard to follow and I wish it could have been brought together more smoothly. This movie was such a delight and I feel privileged to have viewed it but it doesn't have that Oscar flavor to it to become an Oscar contender. It would have to be a unanimous critical applaud for this film to make a dent. It's an Ace for the ""Aces""Grade: ***1/2/****",Smokin' Aces

95,Offworld_Colony,I get it. I get why people wouldn't like this movie.,6,17 February 2020,"I understand why it is bad. But I do like it a lot. I like the stings of heart, I like the strange blend of cartoon and realism of the characters and dialogue, I like Piven's sympathetic performance, I like that this is the first film where Ryan Reynolds proved he could be a dramatic action actor, I like that it's an example of how editing, sound and music can come together to make a potentially roughshod and budget-straining movie cohesive, and look and feel its best.Yes the plot is convoluted, some of the side stories are utterly pointless, it's a movie that's far too short and the ending explanation is far too lofty that it created rolling eyes. There's a lot of little bits seeded in, but it thinks it's cleverer than it is, you don't care about the story, and it's far too much like his first film, a sort of post-Tarantino, slight, action flick when action flicks weren't as well received as they are in the post-John Wick days.I first watched this highly anticipated. I had seen Narc when I was learning to love movies, and recently The Grey is an underrated modern masterpiece, so I was fully in to the potential of Joe Carnahan who likes to get to the meat and potatoes of man. Sometimes. And while it doesn't reach those highs, it's got a lot to like, Mauro Fiore's low-fi popping teals and golds and Clint Mansell's little zings of score.I really did used to love this movie and in the post-Wick world, it might have gone over better if it didn't take itself too seriously where it did, and had a bit more tongue-in-cheek winking where it didn't.

Well, I will try to be considerate and not waste your time with a lot of repetition then :)Suffice to say that the movie is absolutely fun and entertaining. After reading some reviews, I was hesitant to watch it because I got the impression that it was going to be just a vulgar and violent film for the sake of being vulgar and violent. BUT... I am VERY glad that I watched it. It was a frigg'n BLAST!In reading some of the other reviews here, I agree with most of the ones that really liked it. But, I don't feel that they quite have it right. Even though some have rated it very highly, like an 8-10, some of the accompanying comments I feel are not quite fully accurate.I will try to explain what I mean. For example, a couple of people do say how totally fun it is, but they also say something to the effect of, 'If you want a 'Deep' film, then forget it. Just 'Turn your mind off' and enjoy it'... Uh, NO... I absolutely do NOT agree with that part. YES, there is a HELL of a lot of wild, violent action. But, the difference, at least to me anyway, is that it is most certainly NOT mindless or dumb. Nothing of the sort... Just putting together the EXTREMELY complex plot, characters, timing, meshing of concurrent activities, just to name a few things, this film keeps a hell of a LOT in the air at the same time and I feel that it does it bloody masterfully!And Funny... DAMN is this movie funny. But, not in the same sense as Guy Ritchie's films, which I TOTALLY love, btw. It does have similar clever, funny moments, but Guy's films rely a LOT on the cleverness of the dialog, whereas in this case, the director (frigg'n BRILLIANT as he is) does not so much. There ARE some clever dialog moments, but the director's forte here with this movie is more with the visual elements, the outlandish characters, stunning creativity, and the absolutely BEAUTIFUL way he ties and blends them all together. Whereas Guy's films have much more of a deadpan, and VERY UK flavoured humour that fills the dialog. You could say that Tarantino does much of the same thing in his own way, with his characters heavily layered and dialog driven. But, in this case, it is more the total creative inventiveness of the IDEAS that Joe Carnahan comes up with how cleverly he puts them together.This guy ***REALLY*** entertains...There is depth here, but it is not 'Deep' in the usual way you see in movies. The maniacally complex plot and the way it is constructed alone gives this movie a profound depth that you do NOT normally see in 'Action' films. The characters in and of themselves are not nearly as deep or developed as Guy Ritchie's wonderfully written characters. But, in a much broader way, just the sheer BALLS of this guy and what he tries to do and actually accomplishes, is what blows you away. Without saying too much, there is this one scene with a completely over the top hyperactive boy and his Mom that was SO damn funny, I just about p*$$ed myself I was laughing so hard.If you end up liking the film, I also HIGHLY recommend listening to the commentary after watching the movie. I have probably heard literally hundreds of commentaries, but this is honestly one of THE most genuine, honest, self-deprecating, and PHUK'N HILARIOUS commentaries that I have heard in a very long time. The guy is stink'n FUNNY! But, at the same time he is not an arrogant D0VCHEbag; heh, once he even actually calls HIMSELF one because he had spontaneously used a French expression that is used for films; then he immediately said that he was being a pretentious D0VCHEbag. Also, the commentary is TOTALLY jammed with truly fascinating details about the shooting, dealing with changes, and especially the HUGELY complex editing of the film. It was honestly one of the most riveting and entertaining commentaries that I've heard.BTW... did I mention that these guys were FUNNY...?Anyway, my humble apologies for talking so much about the commentary, but it truly does help you appreciate what went into the film and SO much more.Bottom line... A DYNAMITE film that is so outrageous, creative, hilarious, and completely mind-blowing, that if you like those kinds of movies, you will frigg'n LOVE this one...(P.S: Keep an eye out for 'Boner Boy'...)",Smokin' Aces
97,pfgpowell-1,Treat it like a comic book and you might well enjoy it. Abstract's the word,6,18 February 2011,"Andy Garcia as the 'deputy director of the FBI' with a southern accent is by no means the least ludicrous thing about Smokin' Aces. The neo-Nazi Tremor brothers who cause carnage apparently for the fun of it demand equal billing. Then there is the vastly over-the-top mayhem of the hotel penthouse shoot-out, the pseudo-lesbian hitwoman couple, the 'master-of-disguises' killer, and the 'denouement' in which an incomprehensible storyline and an unbelievably far-fetched plot are concluded. None, of it makes any sense at all. But, inexplicably, it is rather entertaining.Watching it – and watching the first ten minutes twice (I saw it on DVD) - I asked myself why I wasn't appalled – and then I realised why: this is comic book film-making, abstract film-making. This is – and I hope I don't sound too pretentious – to conventional film-making what 12-tone composing is to rather more strait-laced music-making. And if you accept it on its own terms (rather like the equally – conventionally – quite ludicrous 300) it isn't half bad.Unfortunately, I am not persuaded that that is what writer/director Joe Carnahan actually intended. Watching the bonus features on my DVD, of which one is an interview with the guy, I rather suspect what he thought he was doing was rather more straight-down-the-line. And that puts me in something of a dilemma (and might even make me sound like a 24=carat idiot): if Carnahan really expects us to take Smokin' Aces seriously, convoluted and horribly contrived plot and all - if this is seriously offered as just another chase thriller - well then it isn't very good.If, on the other hand this was intended – oh dear, I'm being pretentious again – as an exercise is film-making for the sake of film-making, well, it isn't half bad. In a sense contrivance is the quintessence of art. I decided to watch this after seeing Carnahan's Narc, which also had Ray Liotta, and that was a very good film indeed. (It also helped that the DVD of Smokin' Aces was on sale at the Bodmin branch of Asda for just £2, which is my sort of price and always a compelling incentive.) Another intriguing aspect of the film was the number of name actors taking part – Garcia, Liotta, Ben Affleck and Peter Berg (who doesn't actually last very long – he gets bumped off pretty soon) and Alicia Keys with none actually getting star billing.At first I was rather irritated with the whole exercise from the start what with its rushed and garbled plot exposition and 'cool' banter between two eavesdropping FBI agents. Carnahan goes for the style of quick-cutting and more or less unintelligible dialogue which these days often takes the place of thought. But I settled in, intrigued as to what the bloody hell this was all about, and reassured that a director who can make his shots (and not least his choice of colour) consistently interesting can surely not be all bad.Well, he isn't, although the jury is out as to whether Carnahan actually meant to make what I have called an 'abstract film' or whether his film isn't quite as bad as some might think by sheer luck. I suppose the only way to find out is to make a point of seeing more films by the guy. My advice to anyone reading up on reviews before deciding whether to see it or not is not to expect your usual film. Smokin' Aces has something, but I'm really not yet quite sure what exactly.Give it a whirl.",Smokin' Aces

The very last scene was quite good but didn't fit within the context of the film - it was far too smart. The entire movie is shooting and swearing, and then there's a glimmer of character development set to some catchy music at the end. I liked it, but it felt off. Everything leading up to that was loads of big, dumb fun that's not actually that dumb.

Direction, editing, writing, fantastic music and brilliant score by the wonderful Clint Mansell, excellent cinematography and camera work (great steadicam work). And man, what a cast! Everyone gives Oscar-worthy performance. The characters are so unique and interesting that almost ANY of them could have had a spin-off by itself: Buddy Israel, the Tremor brothers, Rupert 'Rip' Reed (the lawyer, Jason Bateman), Hugo, Lazlo Soot, Pasquale Acosta, and even the kid and his grandmother - I would watch a movie about ANY of them. Brilliant weirdo characters and brilliant performance by all of them.I simply don't understand how a guy like Joe Carnahan can write and direct such a brilliant movie - and then come up with awful movies like ""A-Team"", ""The Grey"" and ""Stretch"".

101,dilbertsuperman,Convoluted crap that flows like an over the top graphic novel/comic book about cop stuff.,6,24 February 2007,"Ryan Reynolds is without a doubt one of the most unconvincing male impersonators. In this flick he plays an FBI agent and it is so awkward and not believable during any moment during the film. They should have cast a man in that role instead of light in the loafers Ryan.The movie itself has a very old plot of numerous hit men convening on the same location to get their target. Problem is they all have the same target so they bump into each other. This movie is definitely worth a peek if only for the karate kid scenes- those are priceless!Ryan was very very poor casting choice and this hamstrings the movie. His bad pretty boy wimp acting is eclipsed by Ben Affleck sporting a gay bondage handlebar mustache and still no ability to act whatsoever. He plays a bounty hunter and is also equally unconvincing as a tough guy as Ryan is. If they did a movie about those two dating each other they could be more convincing in their roles. But as far as tough guys?? These guys DON'T RATE.There are short fragmented scenes of brilliance here and there, basically this movie should be re-shot without ben and ryan and they would have a classic on their hands.One nice trick is the scenes flowing into each other smoothly- like one scene a guy will say ""key."" and the very next scene is someplace completely different with another character holding a key doing something unrelated. That had a very trippy 70's feel to it.There was one group of hit men that really spun this flick into comic book land. If you understand you are watching a comic book on film about cop stuff then this will be bearable.",Smokin' Aces
102,nobbytatoes,the bullet jammed here,6,8 February 2007,"""Make it make sense!"" On one simple line of dialog, Smokin' Aces rests on such a critical breaking point. The brains behind this action film of operatic proportions, Joe Carnahan, ditch to tie everything together and reveal relevance to everything that was previously beheld, explodes in his face, killing what was a highly indulgent romp. Before this moment to show the slightest of moral, a romp is all Smokin' Aces is.It's hard not to see an influence of Tony Scott (with a touch of Guy Ritche Snatch era). A man who seems to be leading the trend of hyperactive directing, over editing, bleached out and over saturated visuals. But an influence is all it is. Not reaching the epileptic levels of Scott, Carnahan controls the hyper activity, though still finishes with an end product that resembles something hap-hazardously mashed together; Carnahan's work on The Hire series a glimpse of what was to come. He tries to juggle to many characters on a pretty thin plot line. The plot in question, Vegas performer Buddy 'Aces' Israel wants out of the mob, turning snitch for the government to whip the mob out. Aces goes under protection, yet the mob want him eliminated, placing a one million dollar bounty upon Aces head, unleashing multiple assassins trying to reach that bounty first.Smokin' Aces is mind boggling in the opening scenes. Character upon character are introduced without much coherence, trying to set up the premise as quickly as possible. After time when who's who and what's what settles, it all becomes a straight ahead affair. Smokin' Aces runs at a hyperactive pace, yet the adrenaline doesn't kick in for quite some time. Not until the showdown starts, bullets flying, bodies dropping, blood gushing everywhere with the walls splattered red, does this gets some guts. Carnaham though isn't really trying to re-invent anything, just to deliver popcorn entertainment, which he delivers the goods.Boasting an impressive cast, too many cooks aren't spoiling the broth, disappointingly too many lye under par; most notably Andy Garcia and Joel Edgerton's Russian accent. Ryan Reynolds doesn't match to a tuff cop role, while Jeremy Piven is nicely over the top as Aces. Ben Affleck and Martin Henderson walk through without much energy. Ray Liotta rises to the top as Carruthers, along with Alicia Keys as Georgia Sykes. Matthew Fox and Jason Bateman are worth their measure in their cameo spots.Smokin' Aces may miss fire at times, and an ending that was better left unsaid, Carnaham executes this with exuberant energy that rivals a child in the world's largest candy store, his eyes were just to big for his stomach.",Smokin' Aces
103,glgioia,A Study in Stupidity,5,27 January 2007,"Vegas headliner Buddy Israel goes into hiding in a Tahoe penthouse because the mob has placed a million dollar contract on him. Naturally, the world's most notorious assassins all get wind of the bounty, and race to kill him first, in the penthouse, under FBI surveillance, bullets, redneck feminist witticisms....z...z....z...z.Up until the final Act, I would have been able to write, ...'but for all its stupidity, it was still enjoyable.' Cant do it! The last stage of this movie was a hitchhike back to town on the guano wagon after 16 hours of hoeing clay. Movies like this always turn me into an instant sociologist, maybe even anthropologist in that I keep pondering the question, 'how can I possibly be living amongst people who call this entertainment?'. There's a lot of star power to the movie, and it has some really funny moments and it is packed throughout with the right kind of dialog, Jason Bateman's scene is in fact, hilarious. Unfortunately for the filmmakers of Aces Eleven Smoked, the biggest laughs of the film come in the final 10 minutes when FBI chief Andy Garcia gives the obligatory 'revelation' 'expose the wizard,''Kaiser Cose' speech in what i think is supposed to be a Gulfcoast dialect/accent? He completely lost the audience to the point where people began giggling and talking amongst themselves, getting their coats, making dinner plans etc, by the time the credits began to roll most people were already standing. But it had lost me about 30 minutes earlier when the world's most dangerous and elusive assassin was strolling through the hotel lobby with his one distinguishing physical characteristic, chewed off fingertips, just dangling at his side for the GMan to see. Its not even worth it. This movie has a target audience, and they probably already know who they are. This film will not attract crossover viewer-ship period. Save your time.",Smokin' Aces

And some of the bad guys are not really wanting to kill the guy, but be there for the promised reward.I did like the role Ryan Renolds played in this movie. However, Ben Affleck was not a fit for this movie. In fact, he is a better fit for family oriented movies. Andy Garcia can do these films all day long and not break a sweat.The plot of confusion is played perfectly. But for me, the confused plot and misguided actors was not something I liked to see.

105,PoisonKeyblade,Smokin' the Competition,10,16 February 2007,"Who would've thought that an action film could be so grizzly and explicit and at the same time so engaging and clever? Smokin' Aces takes the action film to a whole new level with its brutality and no-holds-barred action. In fact, Smokin' Aces has already emerged as one of the best films of the year. Aces is written and directed by Joe Carnahan, and features a diverse array of fantastic actors. This is a character-driven piece, and not a single actor or actress manages to disappoint. Ben Affleck, Jason Bateman, Andy Garcia, Alicia Keys, Ray Liotta, Jeremy Piven, Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pine, Kevin Durand, Maury Sterling, Taraji P. Henson, Peter Berg, and Common star in this energetic, pumped, fast-paced film.When a Las Vegas performer (Piven) decides to testify against the mob, trouble comes a-knocking at the Lake Tahoe Casino where Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is hiding out. Three bail bondsmen (Affleck and others) set out to protect Israel and bring him safely into custody. Two FBI agents (Liotta and Reynolds) are also out to help Israel. Primo Sparazza, leader of the mob, is dying, and his final wishes involve the death of Israel, so he dispatches many various hit men: the lesbians Georgia Sykes (Keys) and Sharice Watters (Henson); the insane Acosta; the unpredictable Tremor brothers, Darwin (Pine), Jeeves (Durand), and Lester (Sterling); and a master of disguise (Berg). The result is extreme mayhem on the top floor of the Lake Tahoe Casino.The plot seems very fresh and new, and features just enough plot twists to keep things interesting throughout the movie. Despite slowing down in its final act, the conclusion hits hard with one final, piercing twist. An amazing script and the strange characters add a much-needed sense of realism to the picture, which makes for an ultimately enjoyable and sensational movie.The acting, along with the script, is what sets Smokin' Aces apart from the crowd. Ryan Reynolds shines in a very serious and difficult role, and his screen presence is undeniably addictive. Chris Pine is a stand out among the Tremor brothers in a role that is very different from his usual characters; he played Lindsay Lohan's love interest in Just My Luck. Ben Affleck is surprisingly engaging in his role as bondsman Jack Dupree in a fun little role. Alicia Keys does spectacular in her feature film debut, displaying just enough gusto and slickness. Jeremy Piven plays a combination of a sleazy magician and his spectacular character, Ari, from Entourage. He steals every scene he is in with little effort, and his acting is phenomenal. Ray Liotta works with what he's given, but he is probably the most underused of all of the actors in the film.Smokin' Aces also has great editing and camera work which is extremely reminiscent of the work of Quentin Tarantino. He should be extremely proud having inspired this master work of character drama mixed with non-stop action. Gallons of gore appear quite frequently in hotel scenes that integrate guns, chainsaws, and machetes things get very brutal as Aces approaches its conclusion. Smokin' Aces was a fun film that keeps you guessing till the end and is filled with quirky characters and bizarre subplots. Certainly one of my favorite crime films, this great movie sits right beside old classics like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and the new masterpiece Alpha Dog. Smokin' Aces is a sensational film with a perfect cast that should not be missed under any circumstances.",Smokin' Aces
106,barberoux,Maudlin Mayhem,6,9 February 2007,"""Smokin' Aces"" was a very uneven movie. I enjoyed some of its inventiveness but much was lost in the uninspired typical gangster story and the maudlin scenes with Ryan Reynolds. I thought many of the scenes didn't make sense like when Andy Garcia showed up at the hospital at the end of the movie he had changed his clothes and changed his glasses. The time line, as far as I could follow, wouldn't have allowed enough time for the change and the glasses were a huge continuity flaw. He wore these distinctive, and rather dorky, plastic frames in the beginning then he shows up with completely different rimless glasses at the end. It was just sloppy. The ending was just goofy and very disappointing. The rest of the movie was typical Hollywood. Drugs, women dressed as hookers and guns. Most movie goers have seen it all before. Watch any TV cop show and you'll recognize most of the players. There were some performances I enjoyed. Zach Cumer as the young karate enthusiast stole the movie. Alicia Keys and Taraji P. Henson were entertaining as the hired killers. Jason Bateman as the alcoholic lawyer had some of the best lines in the movie. Most of the other players were stock Hollywood types. The old Mission Impossible show was used as a template for some of the plot but the TV show did it better. Jeremy Piven hammed it up so much he should get the Spam award and go back to bit parts. Overall I think there were too many players and they weren't developed enough for you to root for any of them. The movie was fast paced and superficially inventive but it went nowhere. It kind of ground down to this goofy, overacted, nonsensical, emotional ending.",Smokin' Aces
107,Jacques98,"It's not Pulp Fiction, but it's still fun and fresh.",2,23 September 2008,"Let's face the truth here, guys: we live in an era when ""action"" movies pretty much consist of a man with a dying son/wife/mother/whatever and ¾ of the movie plays out as Lifetime TV drama, while maybe 5 minutes of the screen time actually have action. The days when ""action"" actually meant its own literal definition are dead. Writers and directors now think they have to characterize a cliché character in conventional ways or their movie is bad. They can't just create a character who actually has, you know, CHARACTER, they have to build an ""emotional"" (melodramatic) plot around a clichéd ""emotional"" situation, and put actual action on the side. If they're feeling risky, however, they have to make a complex plot about cliché terrorists and then spend over half the runtime with conversation scenes trying to force the audience to understand their cliché plot that we understood from the first trailer.Sadly, most of Smokin' Aces fits into the latter category. Instead of the word ""terrorist"" on the script they typed ""mob"", but the structure is still identical. It is very slow-moving, despite what the reviews on here want to say. The first half of the movie is at a standstill, where there is pretty much no action. The second half is pure straight-forward gunfights and explosions, and unlike typical action movies, once the action does start it does not stop for anything. At least the writer/director got most of it right. But more importantly, I can't point to a single spot in the film where I was bored.The reason I wasn't bored during the standstill time is because the characters are not clichés. They all do things you'd never think you'd see happen in an action movie, and they all have Character. I simply cannot say this enough: they are actually memorable, and not just something to drive the plot. The characters have CHARACTER. Why can't the rest of Hollywood understand that concept? As far as the action itself goes, it's pretty good. There are more deaths than I even though possible for this film, and some of the kills are just freaking amazing. Unlike all the reviews are stating, this isn't really a gory movie, though. The gunshots have little blood splatter, if any, and the more gruesome deaths are almost always done in ways to block the graphicness.The plot twist in the end made me smile. After so many walk-off-into-the-sunset endings, it was very nice to see a film that actually attempted to have a good ending. Really, I just can't think of any real major flaw the movie hadit was your perfect pointless action movie. Watch it.2/10",Smokin' Aces

I figure I'll just tell you that it's pretty bad. The cast is pretty much wasted here, though I actually did like Alicia Keys and Common as I thought they came off as pretty natural for two amateur actors. All these characters who are all image with no depth.... crying shame. The marketing blitz for the film was pretty nifty, to the point that there was no way the film could've lived up to it. It's violent but they show you pretty much what to expect in the commercials. If you want to see a better film that is more along the lines of what the director was going for only better, see 2006's ""Running Scared"" with Paul Walker.By the end of this film, I felt drained.

110,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"An unpredictable, exhausting, and original thriller",8,13 February 2007,"'Smokin' Aces', from writer/director Joe Carnahan (Narc), is one of those films that will infuriate you with its complexity and seemingly meaningless events to the point where you will want to exit the theater...until the end. The film is near unbearable due to how confusing it can get, which is its main fault. However, when the unpredictable ending rolls around, you will forgive Carnahan for messing with your head so much. With an all-star cast and an original and intriguing plot of interlocking stories, Smokin' Aces is a winner that should be watched carefully, because any missed details would turn this film from great to horrible. By all-star cast, I mean Ben Affleck, Jeremy Piven, Ryan Reynolds, Ray Liotta, Peter Berg, Alicia Keys, Andy Garcia, Taraji Henson, Martin Henderson, Matthew Fox, Common, and Jason Bateman.Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Emmy Winner Jeremy Piven), a comedian/illusionist turned mobster, has decided to turn in evidence against the mob when things start to sour. Now, the mob has a price on the head of Aces: one million dollars. May the best hit-man win. Soon, 2 FBI Agents (Reynolds and Liotta) are out to extract Aces and put him in federal protection before the contract killers come to ice the Ace.Each member of the main ensemble cast delivers a winning performance, with Piven and Ryan Reynolds leading the pack. In his best performance, Reynolds blew me away with his incredible ability to act conflicted, yet still portray a strong and powerful character. Despite all his hilarious comedic performances, his portrayal of Agent Messner is the best of his career. Kudos to Carnahan as well for writing such a great character. It's easy to see that of all the characters, Carnahan probably liked Messner the most, as he gives Messner most of the memorable lines and the most screen time aside from Aces. Aces is portrayed beautifully by Jeremy Piven. Once again, an actor known primarily for comedy delivers a winning performance with a wonderful character. Piven is phenomenal as the snitch Aces, conveying every emotion perfectly, especially hopelessness and fear. The other main roles were filled very well. Grammy winner Alicia Keys wasn't bad at all in her first film, portraying one of the killers very well. I look forward to seeing her in more movies. Taraji Henson as Keys' partner was another good casting move. With this and Hustle & Flow, Henson is really building an impressive resume of emotionally stirring performances. Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia both live up to their legendary expectations as FBI agent and FBI Deputy Director respectively. Liotta plays one of the truly moral and good characters in the movie (probably the only one in exception to Reynolds's character), and there is no doubt where his loyalties lie when he first appears. Andy Garcia gives a mysterious performance that is fully explained at the end, and he too commands the screen in what little screen time he has. Ben Affleck, in his second straight attempt to break his typecast, gives a good performance, but he doesn't have a lot of screen time at all, so it's not much to judge. He certainly doesn't hurt the film, and the same goes for Martin Henderson and Peter Berg. Jason Bateman is the comic relief of the film, and he accounts for some of the funniest moments of the film as a result. Another musician turned actor in the feature is Common, who gives a surprisingly deep performance. You really feel what his character is thinking when his character goes from obscure background character to main character.Carnahan directs the film well, but not great. His writing on the other hand...wow. This film will keep you guessing until the end...actually you'll still be trying to figure it out when you're leaving the film. The twists and turns are nonstop, and once you reach the end, it all comes together for a spellbinding finish reminiscent of the finishes of The Prestige, Fight Club, and Memento. Smokin' Aces is the action/non-racial version of Crash. The only faults I have with the film is that the first 75 minutes are infuriatingly confusing, and that there are a lot of unnecessary subplots, especially with Martin Henderson's character. However, the phenomenal ending overshadows all of this and makes this film highly enjoyable if you're the type that enjoys complex thrillers. I recommend this to ages 18 and older, due to the extremely complicated plot and brutal violence, not to mention some nudity and intense dialog.8/10 --spy",Smokin' Aces

It's just a 108-minute waste of digital bandwidth. Director Joe Carnahan, who also wrote the script and therefore has no one to blame but himself, carries to the max the modern school of film-making that holds that the teenage (straight) male audience has the approximate attention span of a gnat and therefore is not only uninterested in but positively put off by plot coherence or anything resembling it. And why on earth did Ben Affleck follow up his great comeback performance in ""Hollywoodland"" with this  does he WANT to remain a national joke? I couldn't even figure out whether this was supposed to be a serious action movie or a spoof; there are scenes in it that are evidently supposed to be funny but are in fact so appallingly tasteless they don't work either as gags or as drama.

112,Jerique,Underrated perhaps?,8,21 April 2010,"Smokin' Aces is not your typical action film. It's a completely different film after multiple viewings. It's not to say that there's a twist that has clues you see more clearly with more viewings. I'm merely stating on the first viewing, you will have a different opinion than your second.I saw this movie twice in 2007. I saw it in theaters and then later on in the year, I watched it at a house party. It's been three years and I finally viewed it again. While I retain the memory of the ending, I mostly forgot everything in between.Ryan Reynolds really changes gears and does something else off the books. I remember reading rave reviews about him doing something he's never done and it's what attracted me so much to Smokin' Aces in the first place. Ryan is mostly known for his comedic roles such as ""Definitely, Maybe"", ""Waiting..."" and ""Van Wilder."" With this film based on drama mostly and a small slice of action, Ryan leads an all-star cast into a gripping tale of assassination.It's not a typical ""kill this mob lord"" type movie. When you put a $1M contract on a person, nearly everyone who's got a gun will be fishing to take the score. That's the case here. Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) is targeted by over a dozen different people and it's the FBI agents of Messner (Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta) to see to it that nothing happens to Aces.It's really hard to choose just who shines the most, Jeremy Piven or Ryan Reynolds. While Piven is almost always golden playing any role, in a unusual role for Reynolds, he really puts on a powerfully intense display of passion and really shows his talent.I found on the first two viewings this movie was nothing really special, but after purchasing it on Blu-Ray and re-watching for the third time, this movie has shown me that it is special. It's a great action flick that shows off an amazing cast of talents. From Andy Garcia, Ray Liotta, Ryan Reynolds to Chris Pine, Ben Affleck and Jeremy Piven.It's such a rare showing of such talent all at once. It's not really a profoundly violent or profane movie. It's not for children, but they could watch it with a parent present, I think. It's a good film that can really entertain you for the entire runtime.

Buddy 'Aces' Isreal is a Las Vegas showman and Mafia syndicate turned informant, however the Mafia is offering a 1 million dollar fee to anybody who stops him from testifying! Que a load of hit men each with their own 'unique' brand of taking people out. The good thing about Smokin Aces is that despite not such a deep plot as one is led into believing, the film wastes no time in getting into the action but as well as move along at a fast pace but the director has managed to maintained that slick and stylish use of colours which make it appear cool (well it is Las Vegas after all!). As I said I was expecting a kind of Oceans Eleven type caper flick with lots of gags but the surprising thing was that was not the case with Aces as it changed gears quite suddenly and became a serious movie although there were laughs but that was unexpected and not really necessary for a movie like this . Stand out performances from just about everyone really but I was impressed with Ben Affleck, Alicia Keys , Andy Gracia, Jeremey Piven and Ray Lioatta (he does not get enough credit) however I felt the star performer was Ryan Rynalds.

The 200+ audience was silent nearly the whole film (and not in appreciation) and then left disappointed.This tried so hard to be 'hip' and edgy and wanna be Tarantino (who's a hack anyway) so badly you could taste it. It was incredibly well cast, nearly everyone was some famous actor - which made it all the more disappointing that it sucked. There were too many characters to keep track of.

The ""snitch""/rat. Thuggy Russians. Thuggy African-Americans. The mob boss. The mob lawyer. The corrupt FBI guys. The earnest/honest FBI guys.This wanted to be every gangster film ever. The plot was loose/pointless and the ""plot twist"" was painfully obvious from the start. Trite. Boring.Dialogue - when it could even be heard was uninteresting and served no purpose.I don't think I'm spoiling it when I say there's a huge bloodbath that was not even interestingly choreographed or filmed and that served no purpose If John Woo was dead he'd be spinning in his grave at this insult to bloody shootouts.Even who lived or who died seemed completely random.

God he is good and was the obvious yet smart choice for this role. Not to take away from everyone else they did a super job but this is Piven's moment of glory. The raw emotion coming out of this guy is unreal. This performance puts to rest once and for all any doubts I had as to whether he is a talented actor. He most certainly is. I wish every actor in Hollywood displayed the same kind of feeling and humanity that this guy does. The wild characters and a original storyline plus Piven make for one super film.

I liked the way that it was shot, liked the violence and the performances were all top-notch, but by the end, I couldn't help but feel as though I'd just sat through something that had tried a little bit too hard to be stylish and came across as muddled instead.Yes, it's enjoyable - better than a lot of other recent cinema releases - and has those three neo-Nazi brothers who are - though unoriginal - amusing, but could have been better had it played out a little bit slower and just... well, not been so tragically hip. Some people will probably credit Tarantino as an influence, but I found this to be more enjoyable than any of his films, though still flawed.",Smokin' Aces
119,kevin_crighton,"Good, but.... (possible spoiler)",7,26 January 2007,"I loved the trailer for this, having a little dig at the company that made it - Working Title. They are better known for making such movies as Love Actually, and Bridget Jones' Diary. However, they have made other movies, such as Thunderbirds (which I like even if no-one else does), and more tellingly, Romeo Is Bleeding. A brutal,funny movie starring Gary Oldman.I bring all this up as Smokin' Aces, to me at least has a feel of Romeo Is Bleeding in it. There is some funny moments, in Smokin' Aces, but when the action kicks-off, it really is well done.The cast are all impressive, but special mention has to go to Ryan Reynolds, playing against type as an FBI agent, Alicia Keys as an assassin, Jeremy Piven, as the title character Buddy 'Aces' Israel.The plot is set-up from the start. The FBI discover that a contract has been put on the head of Buddy Israel, for $1m, and also his heart.The film then follows the FBI, and a series of hired killers all trying to get to Buddy. The FBI, who want all his knowledge on the mafia he knows, the killers who want the money.I don't want to say more, other than there are some bloody, but impressive shoot-outs, and also some funny moments, either in the dialogue, or in a couple of deaths (at least the showing I was at).However...... while it is a very good movie, I was disappointed with the turn the story takes at the end. If you pay attention to what has been going on, you may figure out part of the end early, which I did. That's not to say the movie is bad or predictable. Far from it, with certain characters being killed off early, or others surviving who you may think should be dead.I just wish the turn in the last few minutes wasn't there. It turns a very good movie, into only a good one.",Smokin' Aces
120,lotekguy-1,Gore and Grins for the Guys,7,26 January 2007,"Here's another addition to anyone's list of definitive ""guy flicks"". Compared to testosterone treats like Jason Statham's pair of Transporter stints, this one offers a more complicated plot, fewer explosions and chases, but more gruesome killings. Plus some fine touches of grim humor, and a dash of eye candy. It comes from the fertile, if demented, mind of Joe Carnahan, who struck first with the cheapie hit Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane, before upgrading to studio-quality crime drama in Narc. Arguably, he's the US doppelganger for England's Guy Ritchie (Lox, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch - both also featuring Statham), since he's less arty and cinematically historical about showcasing mayhem than Quentin Tarantino.Jeremy Piven plays a Las Vegas lounge star and gangster wannabe, who first endears himself to the Mob, runs afoul of the local Capo, then offers his testimony to the FBI in exchange for protection and profit. When the Mafiosi put a $1M price-tag on his head, hordes of hit persons (solos and teams, male and female, foreign and domestic; the EEOC would be more than satisfied with this field's diversity), some hired, others freelance, converge on the casino penthouse in Lake Tahoe where their quarry is ""hiding"", while his agent (gifted, yet underemployed, Curtis Armstrong) negotiates terms with the Feds.The deep cast includes Ben Affleck, Ray Liotta, Andy Garcia, Jason Bateman, Alicia Keys, and plenty of other familiar faces. Carnahan careens among multiple arenas of plotting, with FBI briefings filling in the audience and their agents on some of the players they're about to face, building to the inevitable chaos of competing factions converging on Piven and his legion of bodyguards, in what promises to be a dazzling display of carnage and comedy. The reality comes pretty close, with a couple of cool surprises along the way.Unfortunately, Carnahan, like a certain US President who comes to mind, crafted his superb attack without a viable exit strategy. After the cosmic convergence, there's more exposition and anticlimactic wind-down than anyone needed, or the preceding frenzy deserved.Enjoy the movie, fellas. But for those who wait (or double-dip), expect the DVD's extras to include at least one alternate ending, and several bloody and/or sexy deleted scenes that were axed for optimal running time, rather than lack of titillation.",Smokin' Aces
121,Jakealope,"Clever, Fun But Not Profound",4,17 October 2009,"Like Carnahan said in the DVD extra, this is an over glorified drive in flick. The plot is so mixed up and convoluted it becomes just a reason to string the story along. It has plenty of time shifts to explain the story of Buddy & the FBI attempts to infiltrate the mob, Okay, Buddy Israel is a sleazy drugged out Vegas magician & mob hanger-on who wants to be a real mobster. But he screws up and ends up trying to turn the tables on his old mob boss Sperazza by ratting him out to the Feds. So Sperazza puts a million dollar contract on him that brings out a colorful bunch of movies-only professional killers, bounty hunters, and confidants to kill him or grab him. The two leads, the FBI agents played by Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds are trying to save Buddy from death. Okay, the plot is silly and tangled. But not only does this movie have tons of violent hyped up gunfire, it features a trio of neo-Nazi brother killers called the Tremor Brothers, some slippery Eastern Euro disguise expert, a pair of too hip black lesbian killers, one of them is singer Alicia Keyes. Throw in a scene of ultra sexy high class whores fighting it out in Buddy's penthouse, and a ho train of new ones to replace the surly old ones, as well as high class Vegas mob degeneracy of all sorts, and you have a pretty interesting movie that will keep you going. The gun battle are total overkill, with a 50 caliber semi auto snipers rifle causing havoc as well as a totally insane, movies only Tremor Brothers attack with cutting torches and chainsaws. Okay, there were a lot of complaints about weak plot, bad pacing, Tarantino-ism etc. So what? What were you expecting, Woody Allen with guns? Carnahan was the one who brought us the street gritty overwrought ""Narc"", with it's bleak character pathos in Detroit. At least this film is sunny and colorful unlike the spring blackened snow bank look of ""Narc"".

122,Benjamin_Cox,"Violent, old-school shooter but needs polishing - 59%",5,10 February 2009,"For reasons I can't quite remember, I wanted to watch this when I first spotted the trailer. But I've fallen for that old chestnut before and it looks like I've done it again. It's not a bad movie as such, filled to the brim with noisy gun fights, excessive language and colourful characters. But like ""Shoot 'Em Up"", this is a blokes film for a blokes night in - an ideal rental movie to be consumed with unsafe amount of beer and nachos and ultimately forgotten.Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven) is a Vegas stage magician who dreams of making it big - as a mobster alongside the dying mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin). But when Sparazza learns that Buddy is turning into an FBI informant, he takes out a million dollar contract on the illusionist which attracts the attention of a wide variety of hit-man, assassins and mercenaries. As they all home in on Buddy's penthouse suite hideout, only the FBI's agents Carruthers (Ray Liotta) and Messner (Ryan Reynolds) stand in their way...If you're looking for action by the bucket-load then chances are, you won't find much more bang for your buck than ""Smokin' Aces"". It rarely gives the plot much chance to be told amid the near-constant barrage of bullets. But at least it makes a decent stab at it, even if it is rather predictable - the ending didn't hold much in the way of shocks for me. So the plot's OK but that's really just the bones for hanging the flesh of the action on and it all looks mighty fine. Instead of going down the ""Die Hard 4.0"" route of near-total CG, this is a demonstration of classic wire-work and old-fashioned stunt work. It might lack the ambition of bigger budgeted rivals but that doesn't stop it from being an entertaining, if shallow blast. Acting is also merely adequate - some characters aren't as defined as others (Israel himself, as the film's focal point, is criminally under-explained and overplayed by Piven) and dialogue seems to be rushed through at times. By the end, I'd almost lost interest as the body count kept ticking over and the final scenes were somewhat disappointing.So is it a complete waste of time then? Of course not - if you like your action old-school then this may well float your boat, especially if you enjoyed the likes of ""Shoot 'Em Up"". Personally, I prefer ""Shoot 'Em Up"" - it's funnier and not confused by an excess of characters but still retains an extremely high of level of gun-soaked action and explosive set pieces. ""Smokin' Aces"" has all the ingredients but somehow finds itself falling short, whether due to limited ambition, budget or direction. Joe Carnahan isn't the most experienced of directors and this is a long, LONG way from ""Narc"". Hopefully, the forthcoming prequel will be better because there is enough here to believe that this could have been great.

The best films in the world are simple ones, like most other things in life. Great action sequences though and ben affleck being killed 30 minutes in is always a crowd- pleaser which was also helpful as he was terribly mis-cast in the role.

127,samseescinema,a work of style and violence and the colorful upchuck of the iconic hit-man character,8,28 January 2007,"Smokin' Aces reviewed by Sam OsbornThe eleven-year old boy inside of me, the one that glues glow-in-the-dark stars to his ceiling and watches Saturday morning cartoons, adores Joe Carnahan's new picture Smokin' Aces. It's a directorial release; an indulgence of the gag reflex, satisfying all the itching twitches of any filmmaker working in the action genre. It's riddled with contrivance and clichés from other, better pictures, but Smokin' Aces imitates with ingenuity and cunning. It's strong and dark in its humor, even managing to rend some authentic tears from its players. Mr. Carnahan lashes out with this picture, bloodying his resume with a work of style and violence and the colorful upchuck of the iconic hit-man character through all its iterations. The film works a little like Snatchor any of Guy Ritchie's pictures for that matter--but Snatch diagnosed with violent psychosis: about a dozen contract killers, none of whom are colorless, are hired to kill Buddy ""Aces"" Israel. The first to do so receives $1,000,000. The specifics of the deal are fuzzy, mumbled fast and spitfire like an episode of ""24"" with the volume down, but the basics find Aces (Jeremy Piven) mixed up with the wrong mob boss and an upcoming testimony. Working to protect Aces are Agent Carruthers and Agent Messner (Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds), woven into a red-tape FBI bureaucracy by Stanley Locke (Andy Garcia), their boss. Anyway, word about the hit going down on Buddy Aces Israel gets around quick and soon more flavors of hit-man than a Baskin Robbins ice cream shop are running around, all looking to remove Israel's heart (one of the conditions of the contract). And so the title is more clever and synoptic than we might've originally realized: the film really is just about smokin' Aces. It's too easy to rest on elitist laurels with a low-level January release like Smokin' Aces and write it off as cheap imitation. Any goof can see hints of Tarantino and Rodriguez, a sprinkling of Natural Born Killers, a dusting of The Usual Suspects, whispers of grindhouse projects from the seventies, and a full helping of Snatch. But how many space crusades or otherworldly enraptures can be deemed unique and bearing no resemblance to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings? Film-making is imitation; be it an imitation of reality or of the unreality of an action flick. Smokin' Aces is an imitation of the snaps, bangs, and bullet-wounds of the action genre, sometimes even doubling back on itself in realization of its shameless furor. The fun lies in its persistence. With all its characters and neat tricks for piling up body bags, you can't help but imagine Mr. Carnahan running slack-jawed through a toy store, plucking ideas and scenes from the shelves of earlier story lines, glomming them together into this furious amalgam. Anyway, the method works, if inconsistently. As in Snatch, story plays second fiddle to style, which is the big, mean ball-hog of the court. But as he proved with his earlier film, Narc (a much quieter, reserved cop picture), Carnahan has a thickened grasp of the medium. Without diving too deep into shop-talk here, he doesn't rely on the close-up or long-shot, doesn't colorize and over-saturate to annoyance, and essentially handles his camera like a sensible, dynamic filmmaker. The film's style is instead a product of the characters, drawing Hitler mustaches onto their faces with Sharpies, blasting off .50 caliber bullets between resort hotels, and fending off kung-fu crazed, backwater adolescents (justdon't ask). Problems arise when, in between all the satisfying nonsense, Carnahan drops neatly wrapped packages of storyline. Convoluted and unnecessarily complicated, the story loops about near the end and almost loses us in the backlash. Even more unnerving, however, are the affectations the characters have weaseled into us by the film's end. More than a dozen characters enter the resort Buddy Aces Israel is holed up in, but scant few manage to make it out. Their deaths are sometimes comical (one character has trouble wielding his chainsaw and ends up using it as an impromptu chair, for instance), but other times their deaths are troubling. Carnahan's script works best in its scenes of dialogue, which trickle almost to a halt as the bullets start flying through the extended climax; scenes with Jason Batemen as a self-deprecating lawyer, Taraji Henson as the lesbian assassin swooning over Alicia Keys, Ben Affleck and his band of reluctant barfly cronies, and Jeremy Piven spinning cards and pleading to his partner, Common. Smokin' Aces works like magic--original, unique magic--when it's not running guns blazing. And when the characters start dropping, and when Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds take spotlight, the tone turns from a blood-toothed grin to heavy-eyed sorrow. It's melodrama, and it's solemn enough to make some of the audience laugh in repulsion. But it's an intelligent step away from the exploitation material (genuinely satisfying as it is) that the rest of the film flings at us; and its end result is affecting and bizarrely human. And to make any character from Smokin' Aces seem human, if only for a scene or two, is something worth mentioning indeed.Sam Osborn",Smokin' Aces
128,liberalgems,Rivers Of Blood Ruins What Could Have Been An Entertaining Film!,2,12 February 2007,"I have strongly mixed feelings about Smokin' Aces. There is so much intense and unpredictable violence, I found it both mind-numbing and, at times, quite annoying. I had to frequently look away from the numerous brain splattering scenes because I find them disturbing - not cathartic, like most film goers do. This is a picture that relishes so much violent sudden death - there comes a point when you want to yell out to the filmmakers: ""enough all ready!"" But aside from the rivers of blood, what I found most troubling about this movie is when two of the genuinely decent characters - one an FBI agent, the other a bounty hunter - commits cold blooded murder out of revenge. One with great sorrow, the other because he feels like a sucker. When the good guys commit murder the message to the audience is that murder for revenge's sake is justifiable. Life is cheap. I find that quite troubling.Also the ending of the movie makes absolutely no sense, which is never a good sign! Why would the FBI Agent essentially throw his life away? At least he's a trained professional! Did it ever cross his mind to pick-up the phone and call someone in the Justice Department for help, like the Attorney General; or simply contact a large city newspaper, like the New York Times? His hopelessness is truly pathetic and ridiculous! Is there anyone in this movie who is not absolutely crazy or foolhardy? What a commentary on American society! The only reason I did not give this rather twisted movie 1-star is because, believe it, or not, there are a few genuinely hilarious scenes I found quite amusing. This is the direction I would love to see filmmakers take more often in the future! One can turn a profit on a movie without having to resort to rivers of blood!",Smokin' Aces

130,rabbitmoon,Awful awful awful truly awful,1,21 January 2007,"I don't think I have seen such a mess of a film before. I found myself thinking ""Will this movie pick up and get better... will something happen that will somehow resurrect this trainwreck of a film... perhaps if I just wait a little more..."". It never happens - the film continues to get worse until a final scene which is so embarrassingly bad it hurts. I'm amazed that some people like this film.Just to list some objectively bad points about this film: During the first ten minutes, characters names and jobs flash on the screen, again and again. They often flash too fast to read, and too often to remember how they tie to what is being said on screen. This is hugely irritating - you end up not bothering to remember and later wont have a clue who is referring to who.Ben Affleck is rubbish in everything he's in. Always coming across like a middle-class nerd boy pretending to be cool. Dressed up like a tough guy, trying to talk tough, with sparkling white teeth.So many ridiculous comic book characters are trying to kill the same person, you have no idea why, it doesn't make sense, and its so absurd that you just couldn't care less.The guy who everyone wants to kill is a disgusting, slobby, boring & dull. Who cares what the hell happens to him.The guy everyone is trying to kill is also a magician - part of me was hoping this would have some relevance somehow but it never did - was never used and another pointless idiosyncrasy thrown in for no reason at all.The final scene tries so hard to suddenly become meaningful it hurts. Its impossible to care about any of the characters. The final scene, when you think about it afterwards, makes the rest of the film totally pointless and IT Doesn't make sense. Basically the reason the kingpin wants the guy dead is for a reason that doesn't lend well to any old assassination attempt - so putting a bounty on his head is totally stupid.

132,frankwhat,"""Smokin' Aces"" Sets Off a Blaze of Its Own",7,26 January 2007,"WellI'm speechless. This is one of those instances where I don't think any person will have the same opinion of the film. It's pure contradiction in effect. There are some moments of pure genius followed by levels of stupidity that aren't even measurable. The clashing of clarity with insanity leads to one big jumbled mess. However when all was said and done, I liked it despite the many, many, many flaws.The first problem is the main part of the plot twist is very predictable but some of it is impossible to guess, so it's not completely pointless to stick around that way, as there is some element of surprise. Another blemish is there are some situations so far-fetched the audience would be left scratching their heads at the sheer idiocy of even trying to comprehend the plausibility of some of these scenarios. The envelope of utter ridiculousness was pushed on like no other standing before it. Lastly, this was a textbook case of style being focused on much more than the actual substance. While the coolness factor was, wellcool; it also took away from what could've been even better as a bunch of parts just didn't mesh together at all.What I liked most about ""Smokin' Aces"" was the comic relief. It was amazing and couldn't have been done better. However since it was so dominating, it far overshadowed the dramatic effect and almost canceled it out to the point where even the serious scenes became funny. Also despite some of the mind-numbing drivel that crept out of the screen, there were instances of complete realism that paid close attention to the tiniest detail which showed that a lot of effort was actually thrown into this production. Minute characters were written in and executed with perfection and generated an aura of confidence that sucked the viewer right in and held right on to your attention span for the entire duration.There's that old saying, ""nothing exceeds like excess."" After watching this film if you don't already know what that meansyou will. The violence meter was off the charts and had so much non-stop action that even the biggest craving of gratuitous gun fights will be satisfied and then some. Most shootouts don't even hint at being remotely possible and letting your imagination fly is definitely a requirement.As for the acting it wasn't Oscar worthy but suitable nonetheless. Ray Liotta probably did the best followed by Ryan Reynolds who really put in a great turn at his first real dramatic role. He vastly underestimates his potential as a dramatic actor. If this were the first time I saw him, I never would've guessed he always did quirky comedic characters before this. Jeremy Piven was fine but nothing new here as he's now probably forever typecast in the role of pompous jerk. Jason Bateman threw in the funniest performance since some of his lines had people rolling on the floor. The only disappointment was Alicia Keys. She did fill out the role well but didn't add anything else besides being a pretty face. While she was the worst that way, even she wasn't that bad as far as that goes. It should be also be added that Ben Affleck was surprisingly bearable and blended in with ease.In order to appreciate a flick like this, it's imperative you go in with an open mind. There are moments where you will be wowed and others that you'll find unnecessary. You'll most likely be right on both counts. Anyone can find out what didn't work right off the back, but at a closer glance there are diminutive displays of precocity flashed about. The basic formula has been done before but this was surely no copycat and did contain many strains of originality. Due to the how easily it is to write this film off it'll no doubt be overlooked, but don't be one of the ones that miss out. ""Smokin' Aces"" is by no means a classic, however love it or hate ityou'll be blown away wondering, ""what the heck just happened?""",Smokin' Aces
133,Derek237,"A lifeless, moronic mess",4,29 January 2007,"Joe Carnahan's Narc was such an impressive achievement because it breathed new life into a genre that was pretty much dead on its feet. The cops in the film (played by Ray Liotta and Jason Patric) were complex and flawed, and even though they were like characters we've seen in movies before, they exceeded their stereotypes and were fully realized, human characters. In Carnahan's new film, Smokin' Aces, cops play an important part in the story as well, but unfortunately they have about as much depth as extras lifted from a TV crime drama.This is a kind of movie I just hate: the kind where characters just drone on and explain and explain and explain. They speak lazily and monotonously, as if they want to seem cool and collected, when really just seem to be sleep-walking through a contrived movie. Think of a Quentin Tarantino script devoid of any lively dialogue or pop culture references, and you get the basic idea of what Smokin' Aces is. For a movie that literally spends more than half its time on build up, there is really minimal payoff. We're given extensive background information on nearly every single character but in the end they're nothing more than cardboard cut-outs. The out-of-their-league Bail Bondsmen/ex-cops, the black gangster girls, the sadistic rednecks, the master of disguise, and so on. That's about as far as we can distinguish them. It's a celebration of violence and carnage, but never once tries to have any kind of fun at all. There are very specific characters who are meant to be the comic relief, but the movie itself wants to be taken seriously, which makes it all the more laughable.This is such a dull, lifeless movie. Alicia Keys' and Taraji P. Henson's acting is about on par with a high school play. Ben Affleck constantly looks about ready to call it a day and ask for his cheque. Ryan Reynolds puts a ridiculous amount of effort into a role that is poorly written. The only role I even liked was Jeremy Piven's character. Maybe because his character is in varying stages of inebriation, he felt the need to actually display some emotion. Piven makes the movie better than what it deserves to be and is the only character in the movie I found to be at all convincing.Then there's the ending. Oh boy. There's a good way to distinguish good twists and bad twists. If there is some sense that a movie is leading toward this conclusion, like say, it has any importance at all, and perhaps the movie is always unraveling towards it or even dropping clues for it, then the twist is justified. Narc had a twist kind of like that. Smokin' Aces has a moronic, needlessly complicated twist that only exists because Carnahan probably couldn't think of an interesting conflict for the climax. It's not so much a twist or any kind of important revelation as it is merely a curtain call.Smokin' Aces is a complete mess. There is about 30 minutes worth of good action, and the rest, I guess, is filler. It's an idiotic, pointless movie that has no depth at all, which would always be forgivable if it weren't for the lack of a sense of fun, either. There are too few redeeming factors and there are far too many better movies out there.My rating: 4/10",Smokin' Aces
134,ereinion,Poor and unoriginal,3,14 March 2016,"This movie looks ""cool"" and ""smokin'"" as its title says, but the first hint that it's not so good is the fact that non-actress Alicia Keys is one of the main stars. And she simply can't act. She does a terrible job, even though some may think she doesn't, but it's obvious, sometimes painfully obvious, that she can't act and is not a real actress. Like in the scene at the elevator, when she meets the three over the top Neo-Nazi characters. Her response is so lame and she delivers it totally unconvincingly, like she doesn't quite know what to do. And its a major mistake, casting a non-actress in a LEADING role, even in an action flick. Jeremy Piven being there doesn't do enough to save this film from being just another in a long line of unoriginal movies that are clearly a rip off of Guy Ritchie's classics like Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. And one advice to the director: adding those running name titles to introduce each major character doesn't make a movie any better! Why? Because it's already been done, to death. You had it in Faculty, those two aforementioned Ritchie films and many others.Ryan Reynolds is another reason I hate this movie, because Ryan Reynolds is the most overpaid, overrated and over-you name it in the movie industry. He simply sucks and is annoying. All this movie is made of is shootout scenes and some scenes that aim at being humorous in a rather bizarre way, like the scene with the karate boy. Vladimir Kulich, not a bad actor really, is doomed to be in second and third rate movies it seems...poor guy. And here he doesn't get more than one line even, which is totally unjust, given that he has a cool voice. Really poor and unoriginal flick, I won't even call it a film because it doesn't deserve it. Action scenes are rather well shot and that is the only treat here, along with miss Keys appearing in a short skirt.

Also, the trailer makes the film seem clever, hip, and cool, when the film is completely devoid of any style or substance or humor. It's telling of a film when the only part that gets any laughs at all is a one-second shot of a grandmother's dildo.All of the characters are forgettable, unlikeable, and boring, and most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their role. While not extremely important to the film, this is probably Ben Affleck's best acting since Reindeer Games -- yes, I'm serious, and, yes, that's sad. Ray Liotta, meanwhile, is playing the same exact role he's playing a thousand times. Alicia Keys shouldn't have even been in this film -- just a completely pointless character.Buddy Israel is the only interesting part of this whole film, but the last half of the movie just features him staring at lights and mirrors from being too messed up on cocaine.So, basically, you're left with a movie with little to no action, no humor, no characters to cheer for, and a completely ridiculous tone-change near the end. Not to give away the ending, but let's just say that the last ten minutes of the film were completely different from the rest of the movie and seem to revolve around Hollywood scripwriters thinking they're just so amazingly clever. It's a ""twist"" that you could see miles away... and yet it's a twist you said, ""There's no way they're going to be dumb enough to actually use that twist."" Ridiculous.So, why a 5? Well, the Tremors were entertaining, despite stupid and cliché characters. Some of the music is decent. And the A.D.D. karate kid and the crazy grandma made me smile. That's... about... it. Another action movie that forgets what action movies are supposed to be. Go watch 'Crank' instead.",Smokin' Aces
136,Michael Kenmore,The adrenaline version of Pulp Fiction for the 00's decade. Wild roller-coaster ride of a movie.,9,4 February 2007,"** There may be minor spoilers, but nothing crucial ** Before coming in the dark screening room for Smokin' Aces, I was mightily unimpressed by Joe Carnahan's previous drab, No Doz caffeine pill-popping, stress-induced angry and depressing movie Narc (an amusing title considering I loved to play the particular arcade game as a kid). The opening intense sequence of that movie was the only mesmerizing part I remember. I vaguely recollect the overlong & overdrawn third act and the ending a major letdown despite numerous little twists piling on top of each predecessor that left the viewer mentally exhausted. I still don't know why Tom Cruise loved Narc so much as to press Paramount to distribute the movie, he must have eclectic taste as a producer.There is a rare exception. I was so impressed by Smokin' Aces' unique (perhaps self-consciously hip) marketing campaign -- the movie poster and physical cardboard promo (I love creative graphic design as an artist and a fan) -- that I just had to see the movie and see what the fuss is about.What a wild ride. It feels like I'm at Cedar Point or Six Flags in terms of visceral, no-holds-barred movie-going experience. It was ironic the trailer preceding Smokin' Aces is Grindhouse with intentional film scratches and all. Smokin' Aces is the combination of the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's clever, violent & sleaze film aesthetics -- Ocean 11 & Casino Royale, Get Carter & The Death Collector, 8 Million Ways to Die & Revenge and The Punisher with Dolph Lundgren and True Romance, respectively.This film is not for the faint of heart. The word ""excess"" comes to mind -- which in fact I thought several times during the most blood-&-guts violent sequences of the movie. ""Over the top"" comes close. There are unbelievably disturbing images that I'd rather not spoil with brief descriptions.While I was engrossed by the visually pummeling experience of the film, I kept in mind Smokin' Ace is a work of fiction, similar to reading Elmore Leonard novels. It's like the blender meshing of the ultra-violent elements of the sleaziest crime novels with lurid pulp detective novels from the 40's, throw in some favorite crime & twisted movies and violent thriller manga (shades of pulp crime masters Kazuo Koike & Buronson) and -- voilà! Yes, it appears apparent Joe swiped certain elements like freezing the images to flash the name and occupation for two seconds -- that's from Guy Ritchie (I never liked his Britishly smug & QT wannabe movies anyway) and Fernando Meirelles' mind-blowing City of God. I recall the quote - ""To imitate someone is to pay the person a genuine compliment -- often an unintended compliment."" Not to say it's bad to imitate, because it's harder to be original nowadays, so the reinvention of the crime action genre is in order to make the whole concept seem fresh. Which Joe did to maximum efficiency, to my amazed impression. Joe & his film-making crew handled the complexity of designing, filming, producing and editing Smokin' Aces with deftness with support of the ensemble cast to make the most kick-ass movie there is in recent cinema history.The sheer absurdity & audacity of Smokin' Aces make Guy Ritchie look humble and Quentin Tarantino hopped on crack-cocaine. I thought The Tremor Brothers sequences are ludicrously over the top in Mad Max meets Grand Theft Auto III characterization and their doling out masses of savage violence. The scenes with ADHD-suffering karate kid aren't funny -- in fact, flat-out pointless bordering on utter weird. I don't know what the heck was Joe's point -- yes, I get the 'Ritalin' joke but I don't know what was the point. Should've left on the editing floor but then that would've made the movie a block of Swiss cheese.But eventually these 'ker-crazy' screenplay blunders are redeemed by further intense character developments and insane-beyond-plausible-comprehension plot twists that may be stretching the reality but still boggle my mind without offending my admittedly average intelligence. The film goes by way too fast in rapid-fire dialogues and editing that would make Michael Bay beam with pride. And it was exhausting trying to piece together the intricate details of the dense plot like a jigsaw puzzle, which Joe takes the cheerful delight in tormenting the audience with mind-bending riddles. An insanely complicated screenplay like this would require using up hundreds of index cards to lay out in grids, and somehow Joe got it nailed to the precise pinpoint of the wall without destroying the fiber of the structure. I still can't believe Smokin' Aces works so fabulously to provide the slam-bang entertainment without collapsing under the weight of implausibility & excess.I haven't had so much visceral thrilling fun watching the ""action with smart-aleck dialogue"" movie since Pulp Fiction in the original theatrical run. Indeed, Smokin' Aces is Pulp Fiction of the new Millennium. It's one big friggin' roller-coaster ride of a movie.By the way, I cannot believe the MPAA gave this incredibly violent & totally vulgar film an R rating. I have not seen such a massively violent film since John Woo's Face-Off bordering on excess to induce groans & nausea. NC-17 rating doesn't seem to apply to violent movies, but rather artistic T&A movies. Yeah, good values, America! **** out of 4Postscript: I didn't even read a review before I went to see Smokin' Aces, which is a rarity for me owing to magnificent promotion. Of course, there are several negative reviews with the nerve to condemn Smokin' Aces as grossly violent & unoriginal while lavishing praise on The Departed and Pan's Labyrinth, which is hypocritical. Smokin' Aces is not for everyone but Joe & cast & crew did a fantastic job delivering entertainment. True about Joe's terrible attempt at humor but redeemed by twists & action. Screw the critics like Philadelphia Weekly's Sean Burns!",Smokin' Aces

138,rstef1,Could have been a contender...,6,18 May 2007,"The shame about this movie is that it could have been really terrific but like so many other movies of recent years, it just doesn't know how or when to end. Carnahan does a good job of directing the violence and mayhem, his camera really captures every bullet hit and knife thrust, and he juggles a large cast really well while keeping the story moving along at a brisk pace. It was great fun seeing all the good and bad guys put through their paces in the intricate storyline as they converge on the hotel in Tahoe where Jeremy Piven's character Buddy awaits in a clueless, coked-up haze.***Major Spoilers Ahead***The final act starts well in a hail of bullets as all the opposing parties square off, but at the 90 minute mark the film goes completely off track. Rather than contain the finale to a bloody denouement at the hotel, for some reason the script has numerous characters scatter after the initial shootouts/stabbings/chainsawings etc. I was particularly galled that two of the most vicious killers are not killed, one walks away scot free! Another appears to be ready to make his escape from a stretcher where his blade has been hidden up his sleeve. And Alicia Key's hit woman character gets carried off by another minor character, wounded but alive. Where was my cathartic release here? Where was the payback?!! The writers don't seem to care, as these dangling plot threads are ignored in favor of introducing an asinine twist ending that makes little sense.In his commentary on the DVD, even Carnahan mentions that people thought the movie should have ended at the hotel. He should have listened to them. If they weren't going to tell us what happened to the killers, they should have just stopped it there and not ruined it with a talky, convoluted monologue from Andy Garcia, playing the FBI head. And the final moment with Ryan Reynolds pulling the plug on Buddy and Sparazza at the hospital is ludicrous and out of character for him. I was left simply shaking my head. This film could have and should have been better, were it not for the final 15 minutes. Pity.",Smokin' Aces

Anything from obvious low-budget direct to video stuff to Transformers.There's the ""I'm an arteur, dammit!"" movie - the director and/or screen-writer insist on throwing into the plot some crap about the hero's divorce, or bad relationship with his father, or alcoholism or similar BS that wastes tons of screen time but no fan gives a damn about.There's the rare, but great, pure action movie. Interesting and non-obvious story; something on the side that adds to the action while not detracting from it (usually comedy, but on rare occasions like This Means War it can be romance) great sense of pacing, and not a wasted second. Think Crank, or John Wick, or most of the Marvel movies once they found their groove and realized nobody was interested in tedious origin stories.This movie absolutely falls into the third category.

Expecting a mediocre, dull film, I found myself laughing while viewing this film. It's in the style of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Lock, Stock and Smoking Barrel"". Written and directed by relatively unknown Joe Carnahan.A Las Vegas magician with mafia ties is targeted for murder and hunted by the FBI. Once word is out, a wild assortment of characters is out to collect the generous bounty to capture the targeted man.The whole film was obviously made just for fun. It's made by and for action film fans with an appreciation for dark humor. The only significant weakness and disappointment is the ending, which goes for serious drama after all the previous dark humor. Overall, I liked the style and technique of the film. There's some surprising creativity into how this story is told. I had a lot of fun viewing this film. I have to rank it as a new guilty pleasure.

142,dmasursky,A girl's point of view,7,25 May 2007,"I don't go for this genre in general, and haven't seen Snatch and all the other movies that this movie is compared to by other IMDb commenters. I saw this movie for one reason only - Jeremy Piven, who I just adore in Entourage. But the surprise was - he's not the best thing in it. In fact, he's not even worth going out of your way for. It's not his fault - his part is tragically underwritten, but I forgive, because I'm not sorry I saw the movie.It's pretty violent (the word ""gratuituous"" comes to mind), but not too gory, so I could handle it. The plot is definitely too convoluted and too self-conscious - I counted three characters ""explaining"" the movie's set-up in the first 10 minutes - needing that much exposition to get your movie going violates a prime directive of screen writing. And there's just too many characters, most that you don't get to know and don't care about. HOWEVER, there's quite a bit of sly humor, which makes it worth watching, and there's scads of great people being great, including Ray Liotta, who brings real humanity to what could have been a forgettable character, and Taraji Henson, who played the pregnant prostitute in Hustle and Flow and is a riot in this one. And the really big surprise - who knew Ryan Reynolds could act? He gives the movie a touchstone that it desperately needs. He may be someone to watch if he can pull off this kind of performance in other movies (and actually picks some parts that require him to).I saw the movie on video, and my husband and I were glad we hadn't made the effort to see it at the theater. If you're not willing to suspend disbelief, then you should skip it - it's not a documentary after all. But if you want to laugh and watch some good performances, check it out.",Smokin' Aces

The FBI want to put him under witness protection and a whole bunch of weird hitman characters try to get him before he testifies. That sounds neat and clear as a plot but the movie is nowhere near being clear. Unconnected scenes involving some weird, some silly characters flash one after another with incoherent dialogues (actually sounding more like monologues) with a techno soundtrack which almost never stops. The scenario is verbose to the level of making no sense at all. The only things that made sense were the commercial breaks (I saw it on a free to air channel).

And like many of them, Smokin' Aces is not half as good as it wants to be. But who cares!? It's a fun train ride filled with wacky assassins, stressed out feds and a Jeremy Piven that is doing what he's good at: playing an arrogant and narcissistic loser. The storyline is quite simple in the core, but they tell it in a way that makes it horribly complicated to comprehend what it's all about. I enjoyed its over-the-top atmosphere and its dark comedy. It doesn't do anything that we haven't seen before, but it's just a mix of cool elements of other movies in this genre. It could've been much worse.

148,RichardKleiner,The most disappointing final plot twist ever conceived,3,5 September 2007,"Trailers are a powerful tool for producers who wish their movie becomes a success. However, they can also be a cruel trick against movie goers, who expect a great film and sometimes receive crap.Smokin' Aces wasn't in any way what I expected. When you hope for a film with a dark humor by Tarantino and a visual style by Guy Ritchie, producers actually give you an incredibly pointless film.The intro was too fast, yet it was expected, although the characters names appeared so fast you couldn't even read them. Okay, so there's actually no character development. Let's see if it can improve.Ben Affleck (the biggest star in the cast, though not the best actor) gets killed after the first 30 minutes. I'm no Affleck fan, so I kinda liked the twist.But everything else sucked. It was over the top bloody (not enjoyable nor laughable). It was extremely and unnecessarily emotive, especially where ""Ace"" is about to be killed by the mask guy, or at least you expected, since he goes on and on crying and getting high for a whole hour and you almost pray to God for him to die already. The ""funny"" stuff was mostly unpleasant, including that stupid and annoying karate kid (I didn't know if he had a mental disease or was on drugs) and his also weird mother, or aunt or who-gives-a-crap-what-she-is.It was stupidly written and had the most disappointing plot twist ever conceived. That ""clever"" twist resulted in disregarding almost everything in the story. Supossedely, the movie intended a moral message or something like it, where you could see what corruption inside the FBI could do: A blood bath for nothing.Well, you didn't need two and half hours to make that point.When I expected better settings, including high speed car chases and different locations, the only location is a hotel with half of its guests being hookers and the other half being crazy, lunatic and excessively plotting hit men.Those neo-nazi monster brothers, what with them? It's take an hour for them to get to the final floor in the building. What kind of elevators were those? And why did that black dude take so long to kill Israel? I would have killed him even before he woke up. And is Alicia Keys' partner supposed to be in love with her? And how come Andy Garcia didn't tell Liotta and Reynolds that that mafia guy was really a fed from that start? It was painful to watch. I couldn't believe you could actually die for boredom (I survived 2001: Space Odissey and Manos). It was a waist of everything: time, celluloid, actors, music and my eyes.",Smokin' Aces
149,editor-299,'Aces' pays homage; but that's about it,5,24 January 2007,"In this newest release, ""Smokin' Aces,"" Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven, ""Old School,"" the TV series ""Entourage"") is a Las Vegas magician and low-level mob wannabe. He's threatened to turn state's evidence and expose various high-placed members of the American Costa Nostra. Thus, he is in big trouble.The other problem is that a million dollar bounty has been placed on is on his head, so every professional hired killer in the area is gunning for him. On top of all this, the FBI, represented by agents Donald Carruthers (Ray Liotta, ""GoodFellas,"" ""Narc"") and Richard Messner (Ryan Reynolds, ""The Amityville Horror""), is trying to corral him, as well.Some of the more cartoonish villains featured in this film include two black lesbian prostitutes, Sharice (Taraji Henson) and Georgia (singer Alicia Keyes), a trio of inept bounty hunters (led by Ben Affleck, ""Hollywoodland""), three redneck punks, a psychopathic knife-wielding assassin (Nestor Carbonell) and a violent master of disguise, Soot (Tommy Flanagan, ""Sin City,"" ""Alien vs. Predator""), among others.Even Israel's closest bodyguards are not immune to the big payday that comes with knocking him off. There are also some interesting cameos, including Jason Bateman (""The Hogan Family"") and Matthew Fox (""We Are Marshall,"" TV series ""Lost"") in a bad wig.The entire enterprise comes together like a blended mixture of ""Kill Bill,"" ""Sin City,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Kung Fu Hustle"" and ""The Usual Suspects""  all of which, by the way, are better movies than this one.Director Joe Carnahan (""Narc;"" ""Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane"") certainly pays homage to others in this genre; but there are so many characters coming, going and dying, no one can really relate to any of them. In fact, the only genuine pleasure this picture offers is to try and figure who will die next and how.However, there is no rhyme or reason for those who survive; and the director's impersonations of Tarantino/Woo/Scorsese leaves very much to be desired.And while there are some good scenes and decent dramatic moments, especially from Piven and Reynolds, the movie offers little new in this department and the dialog (also by Carnahan) is pretty stilted and clichéd most of the time.Also beware of the graphic violence which includes, shootings at close range, roastings, beheadings, slicings, dismemberments, stabbings and other various ways of expiration.Overall, this movie is entertaining enough to hold one's interest during its running time, but there's really nothing new here.",Smokin' Aces

I completely disagree in that I thought this was a very entertaining movie. The concept was very well thought out but it wasn't perfect, obviously.Basically, the movie was about several groups of assassins all gunning for the same man for the same price. The reason he is wanted dead is because of his snitching and deceitful ways. I'm not going to give anything away, but once you watch the movie you'll know there's a lot more behind that. Only thing you really need to do is pay as close attention as you can during the beginning, because it does get a little confusing. The story moves along pretty quickly, but you will get the gist of it.Overall, I thought it was very well done. The plot was good, the characters were amazing (especially Ryan Reynolds), and there were some nice action parts. Even though it dragged on a little bit during the middle, it was necessary to develop plot details. 9 out of 10 stars from me; it was very entertaining and thought provoking.

From the initial preview Aces appeared to be a hight octane action movie like Domino however as it turns out its nothing more than a hybrid of The Usual Suspects & True Romance. The only difference between these movies is that Aces uses its paper thin storyline kinetic pacing and multitude of characters as a smoke screen to hide the fact that there is nothing going on underneath all the layers. Aces is smug not clever the big twist at the end if your paying attention and not distracted by all the nonsense can be figured out within the first 1/2 hour. I wasn't expecting anything from Smokin Aces again maybe Domino or even the much underrated Running Scared pure junkfood but real where it counts but it falls in the typical run of the mill Hollywood action movie masquerading as something gritty and dangerous. This is far worse than a movie that is just awful from top to bottom because Aces has all the right elements but due to its principal motive its all rendered moot.

152,Aomalle27,Big Disappointment....****Spoiler ensue**************,2,9 May 2008,"Conceptually this is a perfect premise for someone the likes of Guy Richie, would truly excel at, but in the hands of Joe Carnahan, it fails miserably. A wannabe mobster, who's just a washed out magician, decides to testify against a major mob figure. Not wanting to be ratted out, said mobster decides to have him clipped. FBI hears of the plot and races to save their star witness from a Reno hotel. There's a convergence of several different hit men teams, leading to a terrific gun fight. Or at least that's how it should play out, instead we get a bunch of small shootouts, no spectacular finish, a silly plot that Aces wasn't supposed to be murdered by the Mob Boss, but rather the mobster needed an organ transplant from the stoolie who turns out to be his son. There's a convoluted plot of the mobster being an FBI plant who has lived the part of the mob boss for forty plus years.Complaints 1---The angle of mob boss as life long FBI agent is just ridiculous. 2---The angle of the organ transplant is equally silly. 3---Jeremy Piven looks like an actor desperate for an Oscar, and his performance is contrived, and overly melodramatic. 4---This film can't decide if it wants to be a dark comedy (ala Snatch, or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) or a serious drama (think something along the lines of Training Day) 5---There's no payoff. The trailers promise a big shootout, and we get the set up of several interesting killers, but they never meet up. Instead we get a bunch of little shootouts. Really disappointing.",Smokin' Aces
153,lekgolah,A high concept story ruined by unnecessary scenes that try to be funny.,2,10 July 2010,"This is a difficult film for me to to decide upon. On one side there is an interesting story that features Ryan Reynolds, Common, Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia but on the other side is what ruins this film. This includes scenes of stupidity, jokes that are not funny, characters who you have no attachment for, derivative violence, characters who are annoying and scenes that are so strange in a bad way, it will make you question if the film is worth seeing to the end.Unfortunately the bad outweighs the good dramatically here. I can tolerate the MTV visual style that is used here but there scenes such as where a child is swearing and acting rather crazy to a wounded person in a bathroom and it made me wonder what the script writers were thinking. There is more to that particular scene but I don't want to go into detail because it annoyed me how a good concept is ruined by scenes such as this.I could go into more parts of the film that ruined it but that would suggest that there was nothing good about it, which is not true. Ryan Reynolds is a great actor and is always likable in the roles he plays. Here he is working with Ray Liotta and the two work well together. Had the film featured more of these two, it would have been really enjoyable. The premise itself sounds great; two agents must rescue a snitch before he is killed by various crazy assassins. The film felt like it was made by two different directors. One director had an interesting idea of making a film that focused on telling a film about a race-against-time before a snitch is killed but then another director came in during post-production and decided that the film should focus on the assassins and include scenes of stupidity. These scenes are not offensive like in Transformers 2 but they do feel like they are insulting the viewers intelligence. Were it not for those scenes, the final action scene towards the end would have been a lot better. It was fun to watch as a sniper punctured holes into a hotel while the agents returned fire but due to everything before that it felt wasted. Without spoiling anything, the ending would have also benefited from a more serious tone that could have been applied earlier on in the film because it does become quite interesting. It is just a shame that the viewer must endure scenes that take you out of the film.What saves the film from being irredeemable though is the acting from some of the cast. Common has a great scene with Jeremy Piven towards the end where the script felt like it was from another film. Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta are also good and they have some nice dialogue as does Andy Garcia. Alicia Keys also does a nice job here in the film. If you really like MTV style films, crass humor and crazy characters then you will find something to like. Having seen the film several times, I can safely say that it is not for me. The unlikable characters were given too much screen time and therefore it felt like we were supposed to be supporting them but towards the end, we are supposed to be liking Ryan Reynolds and his team when the focus changes to them. If the structure is weak, then how is the film supposed to stay together? This is a similar case with The Spirit; I wanted to like the film so I tried to forgive its flaws but sadly once again I am unable to. High concept stories such as this have a lot of potential but a better editor is desperately in need because there are scenes where the film would have benefited had they not of been present, which sums up the film. Good dialgoue, solid acting, a strong cast, a fantastic soundtrack by Clint Mansell and a somewhat clever ending are all completely let down by scenes that were inappropriate and destroyed the flow of the film.",Smokin' Aces

It was a massacre of coincidental justice & injustice intertwined, where nearly everyone it seems claims some association to the FBI, real or imagined.It has just a couple of things going for it, the impressive settings & rooms/building about to be shot up endlessly, & the last 5 minutes of drama which held the attention of myself & the people around me.Typical of its lack of credibility was a shootout in a lift, where we are supposed to believe that a pair of crack-shooters for the underworld & the FBI, could fire an avalanche of bullets at each other that virtually destroys the lift & still be alive to contribute to the ongoing action for another 10-15 minutes. These guys were supposed to be trained marksmen & yet a hail of bullets from either of them at close range can't eliminate either. While outside the lift, a massacre is unfolding a few yards away, where one high-ranking agent is shooting out at another building, seemingly at random firing his bullets into a cityscape scenario of everyday life & then in frustration throws his gun out at the killer building away, who's mowing down the police & agents in the foyer around him.

Ben really has little acting skill. He comes off passably, barely, in a role he has played many times before, but with no improvement.

156,wereuat06-1,Excellent Action With style,10,4 January 2007,I went to the world premier of this movie and it was excellent. I was surprised at how they made a hit man movie with a great story so stylish. The action sequences were very entertaining along with Jeremy Piven smart style and elegant acting making this movie superb. It keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. It is a very hard hitting mob movie. With some unfamiliarly faces to the hit men. Then there is Ben Affleck who plays Jack Dupree in perfect fashion. I came to see a good crime movie and thats what they gave me. There is no way you cannot like this movie unless your under seven. It has everything suspense action violence sexiness and even comedy.This movie persists in a much faster version of a Goodfellas and Lucky Number Slevin. Every part makes you hope the next part is better and gives out the impression that the mob could be this hard hitting. All the hit men are played perfect looking to kill this one man who has snitched and they use there weapons the way any action freak would want them to. This movie is a great action with comedy. It is for the family 14 and up. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good crime movie with fashion. I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Make sure you see it when it comes out.,Smokin' Aces
157,garrettderose,Flat,4,25 September 2009,"This movie has an amazing concept. It's executed pretty poorly. I was so excited about this movie, and it was exactly the opposite of what I expected. Sometimes that's a good thing. In this case, it was bad. The only real redeeming thing about Smokin' Aces is Ray Liotta - and that's a stretch. One of the most overrated and skill-less actors in my opinion.I don't recommend this to anybody. The characters and costumes look great, the idea is fantastic - but it doesn't flesh out at all. There's a horrific scene with a little kid getting an erection if I remember correctly. Horrifying.Epic fail",Smokin' Aces
158,larry.launders,Very worth seeing,7,30 January 2007,"This is an enjoyable movie! Yes...it strains itself trying hard to be hip in both style and dialog, and it succeeds more than it fails. It does fail here and there, and I think those few places will be largely up to the tastes of the viewer.You also have to pay attention throughout, there's not many places that offer enough time for you to run out to the restroom without missing something somewhat important.The beginning of the movie starts off a little on the slow side, compared to the ride that is the bulk of the movie. I was disappointed in the ending, I thought it was clumsy...but it pace slows down like a roller coaster coming into the station for you to disembark.Within the movie, Ben Affleck, if he bothers you, isn't in the movie enough to detract from it, IMHO. I say this only because I've seen other reviews that lampoon his performance, and it is insignificant enough I don't think it warrants those comments. I had expected more screen time for Jeremy Piven, as he plays the primary character the movie is about, but at least equal time is given to the Feds and the other hit men.Speaking of, I thoroughly enjoyed the Tremor Brothers. I'd enjoy seeing a movie based around them they way they came off in this one! There's a good sprinkling of weirdness throughout to keep the scenery changing, and get you laughing in between some heavy action scenes.LLLVIS-Bob says ""Check it out!""",Smokin' Aces
159,ElmStreetsLastBrat,Awesome movie!,7,13 February 2007,"I finally got the chance to see ""Smokin' Aces"" tonight after wanting to see it since it was first released in theaters. And I was a little skeptical about seeing it because I had heard of all the graphic violence in it. But the trailer just made it look like it would be a fun, cool movie and that's why I had intentions of seeing it. And what you saw in the trailer is what you got. I loved this film. I think it's great. Of course it isn't Oscar material and it won't go down in history as a historical film, but it isn't a stinker. I have seen worse. Even though I had read all the bad reviews for this film, I never relied on them. I always seem to like the films that the critics hate anyway. Anyway onto the plot: Jeremy Piven, in an outstanding performance, plays Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, a Las Vegas magician who befriends the Mob and tries to become a part of it. But realizing that he doesn't fit in, he decides to turn in states evidence and testify against them. Therefore he is in protective custody and in the care of the FBI. Upon hearing of Buddy Israel's decision, Primo Sparazza, the Mob Boss, puts a price of $1 million on Israel's head to the one person who will kill him. And that involves dozens of hit men out to get Buddy Israel and get their hands on that money. And so the FBI has to fight to keep Buddy Israel alive so they can have that evidence. Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta play the two main FBI agents who are trying to keep Buddy alive. Alicia Keys, Ben Affleck, Chris Pine, Nestor Carbonell, and Martin Henderson are among the hit men who are out for Buddy Israel's blood. But there's a twist: Not only does Primo Sparazza want Buddy Israel dead, he wants his heart. But if I said anymore it would be a huge spoiler and I don't want to ruin it for anyone who reads this review before they see the film.This film was an adrenaline rush. It kept my heart pumping. Especially during the climax when all the hit men are in the hotel and they're trying to get up to the suite where Buddy Israel is staying. I was leaning forward in my seat and my heart was pounding so hard I could hear it! Some of the violence was cringe-worthy but it wasn't too gratuitous. I think all the actors did fine jobs. Especially Ryan Reynolds, Ray Liotta, and Jeremy Piven. I'm a Piven fan anyway and his performance was amazing in this film. He made you hate him and feel sympathy for him at the same time. There's this one scene where he's looking in the mirror at himself and he covers one eye with is hand and it's almost as if he doesn't even know who that is in the mirror. And he starts to cry. That was a touching scene. Jeremy was great. He played Buddy Israel perfectly. I don't think any other actor could have played that part better. Any fan of his should see this film. He's not on screen a whole lot but when you do see him he steals the scene. He should get the recognition he deserves for this film. Anyway this film was so great and I enjoyed it thoroughly. My only complaint is that I felt it had too many characters and I found it difficult to keep up with all of them and what their backgrounds were. But it didn't' distract me from focusing on the plot. Most of them are discarded before the film ends anyway. I loved ""Smokin' Aces"" and I will own the DVD! Thank you for reading my review!",Smokin' Aces
160,mikhalt,Smoking aces review,8,28 January 2007,"based on my view of the trailer several times I have come to the conclusion I will for sure see this movie because of its solid plot and a great cast of characters. One actor I believe is from Vancouver actually or at least got his career started here who knows. the story is based around this Israel character and people around him just wanting to kill him because of information he knows. Probably has to do with mafia or something underground, which makes sense to the hit men trying to put him out of commission. Maybe he was a runner, messenger or hit-man himself. The question is how well will this movie hit people, I think it will hit well, but wont hit the Oscar bored anytime soon.",Smokin' Aces
161,snow0r,Falls flat at the last hurdle,5,28 March 2007,"The Smokin' Aces you'll watch is a different film to the one you'll have come to expect from the trailer. While there are guns, explosions, jokes, and women, things aren't quite what they seem as it also comes with a misguided attempt to turn itself into an intelligent drama which unfortunately fails spectacularly at the film's close.That said, for 90 well-paced, stylish minutes, people make jokes and die in exciting ways, so you can sit back, switch off, and enjoy it. However, once the shooting stops, it self-destructs by trying to smarten up with a ridiculous plot twist, as if it's apologising for the guns and partial nudity we enjoyed earlier. The subplots fail to come together and it just falls apart, leaving you disappointed. Problems aside, Smokin' Aces is an enjoyable ride. Just make sure you leave before it forgets it's just an action movie and tries to become something it isn't.",Smokin' Aces
162,jon2005,Smokin' Aces,7,4 April 2007,"Watching Smokin' Aces is like watching a film you loved from your childhood many years later  it's entertaining enough but it's just not as good as you remember. Maybe it's because you've seen it all before or maybe because it's been bettered by another film. The problem with Smokin' Aces is the former; we've seen it all before. And whilst it is entertaining, its lack of originality and the troublesome serious streak that runs through it ultimately lets it down.The plot is fairly paper thin, and for the most part this is not a problem. Buddy 'Aces' Israel is a stage magician with ties to the mob. When he decides to turn informant for the FBI, head mobster Primo Sparazza puts a $1 million bounty to whoever brings back his heart. Several groups of assassins then decide that they all want a piece of that, leaving two federal agents (Ray Liotta and a surprisingly talented Ryan Reynolds) to try and protect Aces.Smokin' Aces is clearly a film of style over substance. The beginning of the film is all exposition, giving each group of assassins a reason for wanting Aces dead, introducing each character with Guy Ritchie-esquire 'names in big letters' style. It's a bit too heavy to start off with, but soon eases itself into a far more entertaining run of mini shoot-outs and chance encounters, each group showing the audience what its capable of (a trio of neo-Nazis with chainsaws; a man who starts killing Aces' entourage and stealing their faces). A top scene features an excellent Alicia Keys as a hooker-dressed killer with sidekick wielding what can only be described as a sniper-cannon. This central section uses the most tricks to keep its audience engaged as it can: slo-mo, tracking shots, and a powerful soundtrack all work together to make the film look as stylish as any crime thriller to date.However this is not sustained into the final act as, like Lucky Number Slevin before it, the film tries to become too serious as it introduces its twist ending. A bland Andy Garcia has the job of more last-minute exposition that, whilst resulting in an unexpected end, is fighting against the tone the film has just spent the last hour and a half creating. It's an uneasy shift and sadly the twist itself is not entirely unforeseen; pay attention enough and it'll be clear about half way through.The references to Tarantino and Ritchie are clear, but there are enough of writer/director Joe Carnahan's own touches to at least give the film its own identity. The cast are all excellent but Smokin' Aces still doesn't live up to expectations because of a lack of originality  it has all been done before, though perhaps not as energetically as this. Entertaining, then, but not the fresh take on an overused genre that we were hoping for.Rated: 7/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Smokin' Aces

I liked it more before I watched the interview with Carnahan in the ""extra content."" He comes across as a screaming, egotistical bunghole who can barely speak in complete sentences, he's so caffeinated. It's the kind of movie a 16 year old with a testosterone overload and ADD would make: not interesting, but fast, loud, and bloody. That the plot is full of holes the size of Dallas doesn't matter. In the end, Smokin' Aces is essentially a bore, and the only interesting question is how a frenzied, hyperactive boob like Carnahan got so many well known actors to put in cameos.",Smokin' Aces

Its really fun to see who's going to pop up next. The movie itself is stylish and fast, reminiscent of a Tarantino film, yet not quite as original or groundbreaking. Everyone does a great job in their roles, turning this caper into a wild rollercoaster of a film. The only real weakpoint is the ending. It's an eye-roller.

165,PhilipGHarris,"No Smoke, No Fire",1,13 January 2007,"Here we have Joe Carnaghan the writer/director of Narc? They say that human cloning has not yet taken place but this film may be the proof we were looking for. This just can't be the same Joe Carnaghan can it. He must be a doppelganger who has no idea about writing, direction and tension.There hasn't been such a jumbled mess on the screen since Revolver and unfortunately both Ritchie and Carnaghan have proved that too many characters doesn't help! However these actors are struggling with a garbled plot which has a twist at the end (two in fact) which were so see through that they were obvious from the beginning. Possibly the way the actors laboured over the ""heart"" line and following this the flashback story which was levered in for one reason and one reason only and therefore (although stylishly shot) must be relevant to the main plot.Performances are not bad given all these things but none of the characters are particularly likable for any reason. People die, you're not bothered. People predictably revive to do one last thing, you don't care. It's bloody, not gory, if you like that thing - which I have to say I don't mind - but I was so non plussed.I think you can always get some positives out of a film and the score wasn't bad at all and some scenes were passable.But did anyone find the karate kid just annoying.

166,CagedinSanity,Thoroughly Impressed,7,18 May 2009,"6.6 (The collective rating at the time of this writing) is pretty accurate.I watched this on Netflix (via Xbox Live) a while ago and haven't mustered up enough words to give this a sound review. So this will be one of my shorter ones. Or at least one of my least detailed, on par with some of my much earlier reviews.I remember a while ago, seeing the previews of this and knowing right off the bat that it was my type of movie. Mindless, violent, and awesome. NUMEROUS mercenaries and assassins are sent towards one guy for being a mob mole. A brilliant concept where they could have easily just made it a mindless slaughter-fest.I went in expecting that, and that's exactly what I got.What I DIDN'T expect is an entire back storyline detailing the history of facial disguises and how much of an important part it plays throughout the entire story - even though it's in the background and not revealed until the very end.So it started as a mindless ""ten versus one"" assassination but ended as a near-intellectual thriller. I was, as my summary tagline thing states, ""Thoroughly impressed"".I know I gave it a 7 but I honestly cannot think of any gripes, and the ones I do are way too minor and end up having a balancing factor.For example, the movie doesn't seem to want us to be sympathetic with ""Aces"". The balancing act? It later reveals that you're really not supposed to be.And that's pretty much the rest of the cast too. They act well, but you don't really give a damn about any of them; BUT THAT'S OKAY. Once again, you don't really HAVE to.So, I suppose I gave it a 7 (as opposed to 8 or 9, I almost never give out 10's) because it's raunchy and mindless and it's not really any kind of instant classic.Either way, it's worth seeing. Definitely. I'm glad I did.",Smokin' Aces

The final action sequence seems to last a half an hour. The story begins right away and its very important to keep all the names in mind for the final twist. To be honest, that is one minus for the film. It has a lot of characters and that makes it difficult to get the twisted ending. But on the other hand all the characters are unique and some you will never forget. So, the characters are the goods and the bads in this movie. The directing does not offer anything new and the story is interesting although everything seems to be waiting for the final action. Ryan Reynolds did a pretty good job. Never thought that he could play something serious like this. Now, action - yes, story - not much, characters - worth watching for the action, kinda bothering for the story.

Joe Carnahan was very wise to turn down the pedestrian MIA 3 in favor of this high-octane outing that delivered so much action,Gore,and comedy that will make ones head spin.But I missed the quiet and coherent intensity of Narc which has been jettisoned in Smoking Aces.Think Mad mad world or Cannonball Run but with Hit men instead without the lowbrow humor not that there's anything wrong with it.We have a Monster cast here while most are very good,some fail to register or get bogged down by the many subplots and stereotypes,From Redneck,Gangster,Crooked Fbi agents,Psycho,or bad-ass Lesbian.Its kind of a hollow but enjoyable outing for the action overkill and Jeremy Piven's Over the top run.Good to see Ben Affleck return for a little while.Andy Garcia,Peter Berg,Alex Rocco,Kevin Durand,and Nestor all make a dent here.What is up with Mathew Fox and that bad wig?

170,Xex-Arachnid,Not a bad movie despite the horrible comments about it,8,22 August 2007,"As the heading of this one indicates, I was turned off to the idea of renting it but then decided to go with my gut instincts for entertainment and took a chance on this.I must say that this movie isn't as bad as everyone claims it it to be. It wasn't bad at all.There's this guy who's a Vegas entertainer, who's going to snitch against the mob and we all know what happens after that. It's how it happens is what keeps my interest.The movie had it's funny moments but the overall attitude of the film was serious and therefore those funny parts to me where showing the darker humor of life. The kind of stuff that you'd laugh at because it's not you but tragic if it was.There are two points that I find are problems for this movie and they are: 1. The reason why everybody hates this movie or feel disappointed by it is because this movie is about 12 years late. Meaning that if this had came out exactly the way it was around the era of pulp fiction and the usual suspects, people would definitely have respect for it and it might be held up there as those two films. Because as you know, things were different back then where as now we live in a very information / communication accessible age and most people have the attitude of ""seen that before"" which makes it a shame for this opus.2. The second problem that I have goes along with my personal movie rule and that is, despite how good a movie is or realistic, there's always that one key element that deems unrealistic; a loop hole if you will that is there due to plain human error or to remind you that it's just a movie. For me in this case, it's the idea of a Cardiologist Specialist still seeing a coked-out heart in mild-cardiac arrest good enough to use for a frail, dying, 80 something year old man. Now I don't know a thing about the heart or medications or procedures that would save a coked out heart ready for transplant, in fact, I don't think that's ever been done before but I highly doubt it.",Smokin' Aces

The action scenes are all filmed extremely well also.After Agents Messner (Ryan Reynolds) and Carruthers (Ray Liotta) hear some news of a possible hit against an important witness (Jeremy Piven), the race is on to get to Lake Tahoe to protect him. But the FBI agents aren't the only ones who are hurrying to get to Nevada.

Violent and darkly humorous you find yourself rooting for whichever of the psychos portrayed you most associate with; the skilled assassin, the sociopath, the tag-team, the mayhem trio, etc. The plot is nothing to write home about (although it oddly spawned a sequel) and the ""big twist"" can be seen coming about a quarter of the way into the movie due to painfully obvious foreshadowing. The movie does ratchet up to a fun to watch final sequence that incites memories of Reservoir Dogs or The Wild Bunch, but in a high-school production kind of way.

173,quatermax-1,"Ah, the best-laid plans of mice and men",3,8 February 2008,"The premise of this movie is a good, albeit not a new, one. 'Aces' Israel, a Vegas cabaret magician, has performed one trick too many. He has decided to turn State's evidence against the mob. Mob leader Primo Sparazza puts a million dollar price tag on his head, an offer which drags a myriad of would-be assassins out of the woodwork, all bent on 'smokin' Aces' in his Lake Tahoe casino penthouse. 'Aces' is under the protection of FBI agents Messner and Carruthers, but even they are not prepared for the barrage of gunmen that come toting for 'Aces' blood and the million dollar prize. And these are not your run-of-the-mill assassins either. There are whacked out punks with chainsaws, hot babes with high velocity rifles, and imported European hit men. Sparazza also has other reasons for Aces' demise, as do others, and I will not spoil the reveal here.As I said, a good premise punctuated with a few surprise twists, and the whole thing moves along at breakneck speed. Needless to say, with all these hit men and FBI agents around they get in each others' way and many of their carefully laid plans go awry. Sadly the same was true of the movie.Convoluted plots don't faze me, quite the opposite; I like to give the little grey cells a workout, but this was just a mess, and a rushed one at that. There was no character development; no back-stories for anyone (except the one required for the final pay-off); the acting was makeshift with lines almost being delivered by rote between the shouting and the hectic action scenes, and at times the movie didn't seem to know whether it was an action-drama or a comedy.Do I care what happens to 'Aces'? Do I care what happens to anyone in the movie? The answer to both is no. Sure, it's exciting, dramatically framed and shot (a little like some of the characters) and well plotted, if somewhat unbelievable, but it has no soul.",Smokin' Aces
174,JonSnowsMother,I Expected a Mindless Fun Action Film Instead I Got a Mindless Pretentious Action Film,3,29 March 2012,"From what I heard about Smokin' Aces it was a hate it or love it film, some say it was a fun and smart film while others said it was shallow and pretentious, even though I understand the appeal of Smokin' Aces I will agree with the latter and I agree with this for three main reasons plus others.Firstly the script is poor, and if there is anything worse than a poor script it is a poor script that thinks it's clever. The dialogue especially, the dialogue at the beginning is ridiculously over exaggerated, it took me a good while too understand what the hell was going on, what was being described was that someone had a bounty on him and the FBI happened to know exactly who these 'top' assassins who were after him, but the film took about ten minutes to explain that. Also I wonder if anyone else noticed that when Andy Garcia is describing the assassin who chewed off his fingers, he is referred to being found in 'Northern Ireland' but when the line is repeated to remind the Ray Liotta character instead he say's 'Belfast', I believe this was either a flaw which never got noticed because everybody working on the film just didn't care or that the writer thought he was being realistic and clever because in real life when somebody remembers a sentence they are not always 100% accurate, if it was the latter then I would like to say this to Joe Carnahan 'It's not intelligent or realistic it's just being pretentious'My second problem can be related to the problem with the dialogue and it's that everybody talks so fast, i swear when Andy Garcia is giving the briefing at the start if you hold a speedometer towards him it will probably explode. But it's not just Garcia everybody speaks too fast, obviously Carnahan thinks he's adding a faster pace to the film but they speak so fast that at times it sounds as if they are speaking gibberish. And by the way the performances were poor, Alica Keyes playing a hit woman did not work and never will!My third and last problem is in a film that has so many characters revolving around the one story all the characters need enough screen time to make them and their story engrossing, think about a film such as Reservoir Dogs, all the main characters are each given their own screen time which makes them more engaging, or the work of the Coen Brothers who are masters at this. But Joe Carnahan is not, so many different characters were thrown into the story that it began to annoy me, it wasn't confusing at all but annoying.I do though have three good things to say about this film as well, firstly I enjoyed the cinematography especially some of the continuous shots, secondly it had far less Ben Affleck than I feared and thirdly it reminded how great characters the Coen Brothers can make as 'The Tremors' are just a take off from the three Nihilists from 'The Big Lebowski' and I would rather watch the Nihilists over Tremors anytime.",Smokin' Aces

And then it makes no sense that all these killers should have been sent after him. The order from the Mob Boss should have been ""Bring me Buddy Israel, in good health, and we'll take it from there."" So basically you sit thru this movie for nearly two hours and come out going ""That made no sense."" The other ""reveal"" at the end of the movie I had already figured out pretty early in. The filmmakers tipped their hand.Lots of blood is spilled. There's so much blood, people are slipping in it. I don't mind a bit of violence in the service of a good plot  but this was just ridiculous.Nobody in the movie is likable. So when they all start killing each other  who cares? A few people also live  but again, who cares? There's far too many characters and you'll get a headache trying to remember all their story lines.Almost every actor turns in a good performance. I especially liked Jeremy Piven as Buddy Israel and Jason Bateman in a very quirky cameo.But there's one very famous actor whose performance is so hard to watch that his early demise was the one bright spot in the film for me.If you like 'Mobsters in Vegas' movies, go rent ""Casino"". If you like mobsters and sudden wacky violence, go rent any season of ""The Sopranos"".

It's a bit quirky in places (such as with one of the teams of assassins that are reminiscent of Mad Max characters), but otherwise just good modern action. A lot of good genre-relevant actors in it too.But it's Ryan Reynolds and the character he plays that really helps keep you engaged. Without that character, it would be mindless, pointless action, but his character brings in some genuine human response to it all - helps the audience sympathise and thereby feel more involved in the story.Just a shame that there's no real twist. They set up this 'Israel' character as being some kind of clever magician, fiddling with his card tricks, and making comments about seeing something that's not really the case... but nothing ever happens with that. A bit of let down when everything else was really quite strong for the genre.",Smokin' Aces
177,superduperspit,"A fast-paced, exhilarating thriller!",8,17 January 2007,"At first glance the idea of a director Joe Carnahan helming a movie like Smokin Ace's seems a bit odd considering his previous effort, the low budget gritty NARC which delved into the less glamorous ends of crime cinema. Ace's trailer suggested something in the area of a Guy Richie or Quentin Tarantino movie injected with Speed, not something like NARC. Was this assignment the wrong one for the relatively new director to handle? The plot itself is standard movie mob. Buddy 'Aces' Israel is a big time Las Vegas performer who's got in to deep on the wrong side of the law and has decided to save his own skin by ratting out big time members of the West Coast Cosa Nostra. Needless to say this doesn't sit well with the individuals on the chopping block who put out a big contract on Israel's head. Cue a band of assassin's, FBI agents and bloody action as everyone moves for the prize who's ensconced in a hotel penthouse.A lot of Carnahan's touches from NARC do worm there way into the proceeding's his habit of close camera-work on characters faces and certain scenes doused on a washed out veneer but plenty more is from the Tarantino/Ritchie playbook. Frenetic cuts and camera-work litter large parts of the proceedings, everyone has highly memorable middle names and none of the assassins could ever be called dull. We get a collection of Sicilian mercenaries loopy neo-Nazi's with machete's and Chainsaws (one has to admire a movie which allows an assassin to use a chainsaw), and no nonsense fully armed females (which includes Alicia Keys in highly enjoyable form). We also get Ben Affleck making another appearance on the road to career rehabilitation as a bondsman and Carnahan favourite Ray Liotta as an FBI agent. All in all an entertaining cast even Ryan Reynolds gets to cool off on the comedy and act all serious as Liotta's partner.The trailer suggested non stop action but in reality we could never expect that despite the thumping Motorhead back-up music so instead we get a lot of build-up play but there is no need to feel disappointment as it seems Carnahan can do build-up pretty damn well. He teases out the chance of violence every few minutes after the exposition high first 1/3 (of which you'll probably only pick up half of what was said, which thankfully doesn't matter too much in the big scheme of the movie bar a pretty clearly telegraphed plot twist). Some suggestive music and players getting into position is enough to have you thinking the sparks will fly before Carnahan pulls back and allows the wait to continue. It's a true credit to the director however that none of this feels contrived or boring instead having the strange effect of making the movies pace seem faster. Last years Lucky Number Slevin had all the pace of a snail by comparison.When the action finally hits, it truly delivers, and then some. The stylised mayhem on display grips you in a way most action films have failed to replication in quite a while. All touches of slow motion, blazing gunfire and of course the previously mentioned chainsaw, in the relatively short time the action elements play. Indeed Carnahan makes a serious case for being the best man to direct an action movie in Hollywood at the moment. A big budget Hollywood blockbuster awaits this mans hands if the powers that be have any sense.But it isn't all sunshine and roses however. Liotta's and Reynolds characters are a tad to serious for proceedings compared to some of the assassins in the mix and the movies ending attempts to saddle what went before with something way to deep and meaningful for this type of movie, instead ending up doing nothing more then making a major character look like an impulsive idiot.For a January release however, a month usually reserved for the dregs and holiday cast-offs this delivers the goods. Carnahan can continue his rise thru the Hollywood ranks.Review written by Gulli, for film site Boxofficefanatic.com.",Smokin' Aces
178,darkraven_109,Pure entertainment,8,10 March 2010,"Basically, any action film shouldn't have an award winning script. You watch action movie for the explosions and massive gunfights, nothing else. The thing with ""Smokin' Aces,"" though, is that it manages to have an interesting story while at the same time being a hell of an action movie, which came to me as a surprise.The story looks very simple; a one million Dollar hit being chased by the deadliest assassins, bounty hunters and mercenaries to date, but there's actually more to it. I seriously didn't expect some sort of conspiracy to appear in the story, but it did. And the good thing about it was that it was actually interesting and relevant story wise; it was able to keep me interested in seeing the ending.Why critics are saying that this is a bad film is beyond me, but screw them. ""Smokin' Aces"" was made for entertainment and it does just that very well.",Smokin' Aces
179,slimjack,A shaggy dog story that goes enjoyably nowhere.,6,23 March 2007,"There is a new genre infesting our nation's movie theaters. With apologies to Garrison Kellior, let's call it ""guy noir"". Films aimed directly at the young, hip male audience. Movies that are an unholy combination of old fashioned film noir and the modern action movie, as directed by the class clown. They offer fast paced entertainment, great character actors, twisty plot lines, explosions and more spent ordinance than used in a typical week in Baghdad. Even new genres breed clichés however and the original freshness heralded by Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is beginning to smell the slightest bit stale. This brings us to Smokin' Aces, a movie that isn't so smug as to be intolerable or so brilliant as to be ground breaking. Rather it is good, competent, workmanlike example of its genre, which is bad news for a movie that wants to be hip and edgy.Smokin' Aces has the requisite twisty plot. Actually it has at least nine plots, all twisty. In fact it has so many plots the movie dissolves into a series of incidences strung together by a smattering of narrative glue. Aces, a card magician and mob nabob, turns federal stoolie and a dying Godfather posts a high dollar contract on him. Naturally every photogenic hit-man with the weekend free descends upon Ace's casino penthouse to do the job and collect the dough. Smokin' Aces tries hard and includes everything needed to qualify as guy noir. It even tries to incorporate the ""Tarantino Digression"". That is, extended expository flashbacks incorporated for no good reason except that they are fun to watch. Smoking Aces can't quite pull these off as they require a defter touch than the movie is capable of.There aren't any real people in Smokin' Aces. All the characters are strictly stereotypes played for effect rather than reality. Jeremy Piven as Aces is the self loathing hop head, Alicia Keys and Georgia Sykes are the hot lesbian hit team, Ben Afleck is the hipster bounty hunter and so on. Everything you need to know about these guys you learn in the first split second they are on the screen. There is no star in Smokin' Aces. Afleck, the biggest name, has a relatively small part and is upstaged by his hat. You might remember Chris Pine, Kevin Durand and Maury Sterling as the Tremor brothers if only because they were the loudest, most violent bunch in a loud violent movie. The only actor who rises above caricature is Ray Liotta, who invests his FBI agent with quiet dignity and a touch of pathos and in doing so sticks out like a sore thumb. It takes a strange sort of movie for a review to criticize the one genuinely good performance in it but Liotta just doesn't fit.Smokin' Aces manages to hold its whirly gig self together for the most part. There are a few problems. It goes on too long after the climatic blood bath wrapping up plot threads you probably didn't notice amongst the explosions. There is a denouement where a hero, brought in from way out in left field, makes an existential choice that is not nearly as agonizing as the movie thinks it is because we have no emotional investment in the fellow making it. Though the final plot twist is prepared for and makes as much sense as anything else in the film, still it feels flat and unsatisfying. Think of Smokin' Aces as a shaggy dog story. It's long, involved and fun to listen to but ultimately goes nowhere.",Smokin' Aces

There is a plot about around 5 different flavors of assassins and hit men competing for a $1m contract on an FBI informer Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, a sure recipe for carnage. There is a deeper plot than that but i wont go into detail as it will spoil the overall plot as there is a very major twist.There are a number of big names in this film so the acting is superb and there are many scenes which left me both laughing and intrigued.Again i must stress that if you go into this film expecting anything other than a fun, exhilarating action movie not to be taken seriously then you will miss the whole point as many other reviewers have, this is definitely a comedy.

It tries real hard - strange characters having strange conversations that have nothing to do with the plot. Lots of cussing and use of the N-word by blacks referring to other blacks. And even a teenage boy in a gi that curses like a gangster. The dialog is heavy-handed, but unlike Pulp, it doesn't have the velvety delivery and pithy direction. It just sits and screams ""Ain't I cool! Don't I look so much but not quite like Pulp Fiction!?""It's heavy on style and light on - well - everything else.Pulp Fiction, like Braveheart, was a one-of-a-kind film.

183,jp_011205,Something's Missing,6,1 February 2007,"Here we are folks. The real start of the year for films has finally begun. Director and screenwriter Joe Carnahan's shoot 'em up adrenaline flick, 'Smokin' Aces' starts it all. With its intriguing cast and premise it looked to be something to talk about. Although it has a few decent qualities, there's still something missing.Five time entertainer of the year Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, played by Jeremy Piven, has gotten himself into quite a pickle. Associating himself with the crime leaders of the underworld in Las Vegas he became delusional. He started believing he himself was one of them. After many failed schemes Aces decides the only way to get himself out of the mess he's created is to rat out his associates to the FBI. In turn, mob boss Primo Sparazza puts a bounty on Aces. One million dollars to be exact. Not only does he want him dead though, he wants his heart too. Once word of the bounty spreads, hit men (and women) from all over make their way to Aces' Lake Tahoe hideout hoping to get to him first and get their hands on the one million dollars.At the beginning, everything in 'Aces' is a bit of jumbled mess. Back to back flashback narratives explaining everything up until the present do not let up and may cause some viewers to stop and think twice about what was just said. The same thing happens near the end and comes off the same way. This is a film that can't be taken seriously, and there's just far too much storyline here. Carnahan tried a little too hard to make it more clever than it needed to be, which takes it down a few notches.Obviously though, we all know what everyone is going to see this film for; the action scenes. They range from good to excellent with none of them being amazing. Some of them are a little too well planned and executed to be seen as believable, but that's not an issue really. They're all pretty pleasing, and that'll be good enough for most people.What really makes everything all go together, and is the actual glue of the film are the characters. They're each interesting, entertaining, & fun. We have a torture fiend, chainsaw wielding brothers, a pair of sniper lesbians, & a master of disguise. Most appealing would be Alicia Keys'. In her acting debut, she demonstrates just the right amount of cool and sexy melded together to make her character Georgia Sykes the vixen sniper in one word, awesome. Also just as surprising and also a relief was Affleck didn't, I repeat didn't ruin the film. Now I'm not saying he was good either. Just go and see the film and you'll see what I mean Now with all that said, there remains to be something missing here. I'm not going to drag out with a couple of jokes what it is either. Plain and simple, it's Tarantino. 'Smokin' Aces' looks like it was made from some Quentin Tarantino movie kit. Apparently, Carnahan didn't follow the directions correctly. Had Tarantino been the director, I think it could've been great. He would have added that little something that only he can that made 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' what they were. At least 'Grindhouse' will be here in a couple of months. Still, if you're looking for some high energy fun, 'Smokin' Aces' is where it's at.",Smokin' Aces

All the reviews claimed this movie had NO good performances, but that is crap.

A magician turns informer, and lots of really interesting hit-man come after him. There's a twist at the end, but it doesn't matter. This is a fun movie.It comes from the screenplay. There isn't a huge budget for this film, but if the film is well written, it doesn't matter. There is a good ear for dialogue, and although there are a lot of characters, there is a separate rhythm and visual flair for each character so it is easy to keep them separate. Carnahan lets the scene stealers (Piven, Bateman) free to work, which helps the film. Common and Alicia Keys have actual on screen chemistry, which I haven't seen in so long, I was shocked to see it, in fact, Common is a superstar. We'll see if he gets neglected as the years pass. Carnahan also creates actual character arcs for Ryan Reynolds and Alicia Key's partner which is rare for a movie of this sort. Also he does a great job of creating tension and momentum. You can't wait for the ending in this movie.Its a pity the studio didn't a lot more money for this gem, they may have had an action classic. A real fun night out.",Smokin' Aces

Sure it has its moments that are meant to be humorous, and a lot of the characters are definitely very wacky and funny, but its also filled with a lot of death and loss. My piece of advice when watching it, don't take the move to seriously and don't go in with to many expectations. Just enjoy it for what it is...entertainment. Its a crazy movie with a lot of crazy stuff going on. So if you like action packed then you'll love this!",Smokin' Aces
188,mullaryn,"Thoroughly enjoyable, though not without it's problems.",8,15 May 2010,"I've read and heard many criticisms of this movie. Most people complain that there are too many plot threads which go nowhere, have nothing to do with the plot, or that are not explained. A lot of people complain that the movie is drawn out and that the ending is very cheesy and weak. I will not agree with these people. I think that Smokin' Aces is one of the most enjoyable action films I have ever seen. It is not ingenious, or a classic, but it provides a lot more entertainment than most action flicks do, and it avoids total idiocy.The best thing about this movie, I find, are the characters. When I first saw this, I thought that this was the work of Guy Ritchie. There was the same wry humor in it, the same multitude of characters whose stories intersect and twist towards the end. Of course, the characters are less deep than Guy Ritchie's works, and this movie sometimes descends to really banal and frankly boring jokes and puns, but this would pass as a really good imitation of Ritchie's works. Almost every character, however little he is on screen, is just great. I think the FBI agents could have been a little more lively and developed, but on the other hand they are more than made up for by the Tremor brothers (the most I've laughed in months was when they were being introduced), the two female hit'men', and the little kid on extreme drugs (One of the only instances of drug use in movies which I found truly hilarious).As for the ending being cheesy, allow me to disagree. It's not exactly in the style of the rest of the movie, but it has it's own charm in that it is interesting, far from stupid, and fairly good at explaining the rest of the movie's plot. Could it have been done better? Oh certainly yes. But what they have now is not bad at all.Should you watch this? Yes. It is a great action comedy, and unlike most movies in that genre, it actually manages to mix sense with strange and action-prone situations (That could have come out better, I know.)

189,Duellist,Fun action picture,8,27 January 2007,"Smokin Aces has the ""plot"" of a bunch of assassins trying to kill one guy staying in a penthouse at a hotel in Lake Tahoe. That ends all of the plot that you need to watch this movie. In fact, the ""plot"" is fairly thin, but don't let that scare you off. It's a fun ride of an action movie.The acting in the movie stands up fairly well for a shoot-em-up style movie and the cast of (seemingly) thousands all fit their role well, including the seemingly minor roles like the Tremor brothers and the security guards at the penthouse.But you're not going to see this for acting or plot. You'll see this for some great action sequences that are well directed, very crisp and very enjoyable. Even though this is Joe Carnahan's 3rd or 4th full-blown movie, he has a sense for the timing and camera work needed to make a great action picture. I'm looking forward to more good stuff from him.",Smokin' Aces
190,zv300,"This movie is an ACTION movie, stop comparing it to Mcbeth.",7,1 March 2007,"As usual I'm not going to go over the plot as a few hundred people here have done, suffice to say this movie is actually pretty good Sat night entertainment. Some people here are being negative because of it's unrealistic story and plot holes, what movie does not have those?? Uh HELLO, this is an ACTION movie and should be judged as such, especially with a title like ""Smoking Aces"". I judge movies on their merits in their category, I don't put action movies up against a Drama, Romance etc. Most of the assassins were pretty interesting but of course they were not investigated in any depth. I was a little disappointed in Alicia Keys and partners characters, using the stereo-typical ""Black Slang"" and using the ""N"" word thru-out the movie, but they redeemed themselves somewhat by having the best action sequences of the film. Keys partner is a chick with a 50cal sniper rifle, and she brings the HEAT by absolutely shredding some FBI agents in the next building. There were a couple of glaring Assassin and Police mistakes, like when Keys partner goes to another room for a better line-of-site shot and leaves the door open behind her, just in time for the FBI to come and shoot her in the back. (I'm pretty sure Assassins cover their back, that's Assassin 101) Also the highly trained FBI agents know they are taking fire from a monster sniper rifle from another building, yet they stand up and respond with mere pistols, and a SHOTGUN?? Do you know what the spread is on buckshot?? If your not standing right in front of a person, all that shot just spreads out, just dumb. Common and his typical diatribe was unnecessary, to say the least but at least some Black people survived. Anyway, the story was not bad but the action was some of the best gunfight scenes I have witnessed in awhile. Absolutely kinetic. You can tell the directors were trying to copy the standard of Asian action movie gunfights, and they come close but Asian flicks of even 20 years ago (See John Woo) are still some of the greatest gun battles ever committed to celluloid. Anyway, this movie is a good action flick and should not be easily dismissed.",Smokin' Aces

One of the plot twists is obvious, and the other is completely ridiculous.

By the end of the movie the body count is very high, but it feels like watching someone else play a violent, stupid video game -- you're detached, and don't react on a gut level.All in all, this genre has already been better covered several times by others.

Here's the big thing that bugs me. I waited until the DVD came out because well I'm a Ryan Reynolds fan and I knew I was gonna by the movie anyway so I waited...sigh... I mean sure the whole Ryan Reynolds only seems to sport a beard with the more serious of roles but he pulls this one off really well. I liked all the other characters and i think if there was a better script doctor (editor) on this project it would have been received a little better. The problem comes with the fact that Joe Carnahan was so fixated on making this an ensemble piece that he forgot to make a logical story. As cliché as it may sound if the story followed one character from beginning to end and rooted a little more for that one character I think people would have left feeling better. For example the end of the movie is amazing. i mean if you reedited the movie abit or just showed the ending, you could forgive Andy Garcias accent because Ryan Reynolds gives a very powerful performance underlined by a beautiful Clint Mansell ( Requien for a dream) score. If this scene where shown alone as the trailer and the movie in flashback or something like that then it would be a much better movie. But Joe Carnahan tries too hard to make a Lock stock barrel and two shotguns type picture that he gets lost with his point.Now lets say that the movies focal point was buddy israel like the trailers suggested. the action would have been greater annnnd it would have been easier to root for him. IN this movie he's just a schmo who got greedy.With all that being said I don't regret buying this movie ( I have coupons so i paid like 5 bucks for it) and I would recommend people to watch it if they want to see come mindless fun and some very powerful but lost in the shuffle performances.the 3 that stand out in my mind Ryan Reynolds, Chris Pine ( of Princess Diaries 2) and an unrecognizable yet hilarious Matthew Fox (lost)",Smokin' Aces

The role couldn't have been cast better. I wanted to reach into the scream and whack him personally. A pleasant surprise (although brief) was the appearance of Jason Bateman as the shady attorney Rip Reed. Bateman's dialogue was not only superbly written, it was equally delivered. Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta were in their typical typecast roles as ""stiffs in suits"". Garcia plays an uptight FBI supervisor who is hiding something. Liotta is far more toned down in this film playing a subordinate agent under Garcia's watch. Alicia Keys and Common are engaging and memorable in their roles as hit men/thugs. I won't say much about Ben Affleck's or Peter Berg's characters. To do so would be a spoiler. Let's just say it's good to see Affleck back in circulation. I always liked him more in smaller roles.The plot is complicated but in chronological order for the most part, so it flows. The dialogue is hysterical and fast pace.

Although slightly contrived, the story line shows realism and creativity. All of the actors and gorgeous actresses were convincing in their respective roles, and sold the story 100%.There were several features that made this a very entertaining movie, besides the plot, surprises, and twists. One of these features was the ability of each group of assassins to distinguish themselves convincingly as strong characters. Each characterization of an assassin showed his or her intensity and focus, both as plotting, fiendish and convincing, in addition to being the action characters they are hired as. Imagine, for example, these demented hillbillies being completely and psychotically irrational, and yet being so skillful and dedicated to the purpose of killing in a most brutal way. Then, the two incredibly attractive girls being incredibly skillful and mercenary like in their abilities as assassins. Along with the other assassins, the sequences involving them were top notch.Also top notch were the FBI agents, trying to protect their number one witness against this incredible deluge and onslaught of highly skilled professional killers. In the story line, the FBI's approach, and usage of their personnel, was very believable. Their delivery in working with the story left no doubt that they performed up to the task at hand, and as well as any team could have under the extreme circumstances they were faced with.It is recommended to anyone who wants to see this film that they pay very close attention throughout, so as not to lose the plot. In doing so, they will be very entertained, and satisfied with the conclusion of the story, and satisfied that each of the characters ended suitably for the roles they were given.

198,GodsPrototype,"These Flowers are wilted, call the Florist",5,15 April 2009,"The problem I have with this film is that we all waited for a big payoff (excluding the obvious twist) and we didn't get the action packed finale that we hoped for. When a gallery of the worlds most notorious hit men and killers arrive at the same time to knock off one person in a hotel you would expect carnage to be let loose It doesn't and this lets the image of the film down drastically. For example the Tremor Brothers who are more like characters from 'Mad Max' are introduced as violent care free psychos and are built up to cause mayhem when they arrive at the hotel but when they charge out of the elevator it results in a multi-second shoot & slash out and ends all too abruptly.I just feel that if you had the concept of a multiple contract killer story set in just one location at the end of the film then you would let loose wouldn't ya? Surely? But the writers of this film seem somewhat scared to make it into a full-blown action film and I hate to say this butfocus too much on the story and making twists happen.There are some good moments in the movie, I thought Alicia Keys gives a nice performance but like Aaliyah before has not found the right role yet, I hope she does, as she could be one to watch out for. The white Karate Kid in the Hillbilly hut had no reason to be in the movie whatsoever but refreshingly spiced the film up and in a sense made me realise how ridiculous the whole thing was.Ray Liotta just strolls through his part as usual & Ryan Reynolds isn't too bad and the other actors do a good job as expected from the high calibre of talent on display exceptAndy Garcia. Now, I'm English but I'm pretty sure whatever accent he was trying to pull off was not a well-known American one and he kept changing accent in different sceneswhat was that all about?! 'Smoking Aces' is a confused film and doesn't quite know what it wants to do with itself, by the end of the film after the incredibly & annoyingly short shoot out scene we are supposed to feel emotion for characters that we never really get to know and almost all of the contract killers walk out of the hotel alive which quite frankly, annoyed me even more.It is a cool film in parts but the sum of its parts adds up to a bit of a mess and it is merely an average addition to the action genre that drifts too far off into drama territory and contrived twists that confuses the outcome of the film.With a better script and more focus on the action as it should have been then 'Smoking Aces' would have been a quality action film but unfortunately disappoints in places where it was meant to be exciting. 5/10",Smokin' Aces

Ryan Reynolds has proved that he is one of the best actors working today,and made critics to change their mind (because I red bad reviews of him earlier). Jeremy Piven a.k.a. Cheese, as I like to call him, was excellent too. The thing I liked most about this movie is that it's one of the rear movies with so many stars and yet so good performance by each of them.

I'm a big fan of Jeremy Piven, and there were aspects of the movie reminiscent of 'Lock, Stock, and two smoking Barrels', a movie I loved. But Piven's part isn't large. All of the characters are terribly underdeveloped and not particularly likable. Many plot strands simply fizzle, never bothering to resolve themselves. The action scenes are OK, I guess. But Tarantino, this isn't.

Joe Carnahan must have been smokin something when he was directing this film. Smokin Aces has so many flaws its hard to list them all. The film was cast totally wrong, its as though the director let the actors pick who they wanted to be. Ben Afflack is a bad guy who gets killed way too early in the film and Ray Liotta is an FBI agent, thats as backwards as it comes? The story had very promising potential, although not even remotely original. It starts out fairly strong and just slides down the abyss as the story gets worse and worse. Piven gives a good performance as well as Andy Garcia, but the remaining cast just meanders thru one ""wish I was cool"" take after another with the same result being a truly awful film. Thru the whole film there seems to be very few FBI agents involved until the very end. Don't you think if the case of the century , that is gonna break the mob forever, was in the works , the govenment would provide a ton of manpower to it?? Hotel security guarding the witness of the century, please spare me. Thru practically the whole movie the government knows where Israel is, but has no one at his hotel, they would have agents all over the place as well as State police and local police.

205,Rooster9,A reprehensible stinkfest,2,24 January 2007,"Making a ""baddass"" movie in the shadow of Quentin Tarrantino is hard. Really hard. But you have to try harder than THIS. ""Smokin' Aces"" is an unruly mess of a movie that induces more eye rolls and fits of laughter than the final 20 minutes of ""The Black Dahlia."" And that's saying a lot.The script is top and bottom-heavy on plot. And, by plot, I mean the characters throw a lot of mob names at us and expect us to remember how they're related. And by ""top and bottom-heavy,"" I mean the movie's endless midsection is endlessly plot less. We get blood, cop clichés, melodrama, cursing, many pointless characters (what's with the annoying karate kid?) and Jeremy Piven being Jeremy Piven. Even worse are the jarring shifts in tone. One moment, we're laughing at three chainsaw-wielding rednecks hacking up a squad of FBI agents. The next moment, Ryan Reynolds is wandering dramatically down a busy street, covered in blood and bemoaning the death of his partner... with an orchestra swelling behind him. Is that a violin?What a reprehensible stinkfest. At least Ben Affleck does us the honor of disappearing within the first half hour. Although his post-mortem pantomime has to be the best acting of his career.I give this movie two stars for Jason Bateman who, sadly, gets only five minutes of screen time.",Smokin' Aces
206,discoelephant64,Smokin' Aces is an Ace,8,29 January 2007,"The trailer for this movie had me so excited. It looked like a Guy Ritchie film, with amusing characters, and heart-pounding action. Then I read the reviews.This movie was widely panned, and in turn almost made me not see it. Am I ever glad I did! Maybe it was me going in with little to no expectations, but the film surprised me. It wasn't what I thought it would be at all, and kept me entertained throughout.The story circles around Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, a down on his luck magician turned mobster turned witness and the various groups of hit men who descend on Lake Tahoe to take him out for the reward of a million dollar hit. The only catch: the man who put the hit on Aces wants to see his heart carved from his chest for all the trouble he's caused them.It sounds like a pretty generic plot outline and it is. Carnahan took a lot of heat for this movie thus far, and I don't think it was deserved. The lead up is fantastically executed, with the tension almost reaching unbearable levels.Sure, it's cool, and the characters are all one dimensional, but I wasn't looking for deep story here. In fact, none of the trailers even suggested deep story. What it was was an entertaining movie, and a great one at that.Some of the plot details could have been cleaned up better and, while the twist ending seemed tacked on, it still was a good ending.Also of note, Ryan Reynolds delivers a damn good performance by the end of this movie, and Piven really stands out as Israel.A great, entertaining movie that I will definitely see again.(NOTE: Not a good movie to take your girlfriend to, as the violence is graphic and gory.) 8/10",Smokin' Aces
207,keving4241,Fun movie with great moments,7,27 August 2013,"People giving this movie 1/10s need to lighten up. Not every gangster movie will be as great as the Goodfellas, Godfather, Casino or The Untouchables. This movie may not be in the list of legendary action gangster titles but what it does is provide a fun and interesting spectacle. The drama is done well, the action (while dragged on sometimes) is great and it has a decent twist at the end. They foreshadow it a bit too much but hey this movie reminded me of my favorite movie Lucky Number S7evin and now I have to go and watch that movie again.It may have a list of some pretty big stars but I hold no fandom over most of these people except for maybe Ray Liotta and Common. I think they may have tried to do a similar style in writing and direction as Quentin Tarantino does. But the dialog in his movies are always more realistic and colorful, also this went a bit too Michael Bay with the action.This is punk rock, gangsta shooting, LA Noire crime story with a dash of hip hop. That combination could of easily gone south had they not done it in light dosages. Too many themes can feel a bit unorganized and I can see the pandering to each stereotype here. Ben Affleck and his ground more of the Brooklyn regular average Joe's, the punk rock Mercs, the hip hop gangsta women, the psychotic Latino slasher and the Irish/European hit man playing the deadly assassin. Had this been branched out too much and did multiple lead roles from each group it would have been a failed wanna be Tarantino movie. Luckily... well most those groups aren't focused on too much. I don't want to get into the story more as it would cause spoilers.So is it a legendary piece of film? No, should it be branded a horrible movie because of that? No... this is just a fun action packed movie. Nothing more, nothing less. So easy with the criticism, I'd consider this to be a way better action movie than most of the junk in the movies theaters now.",Smokin' Aces
208,amacmillen,AMAZING movie,10,30 March 2007,"This movie delivers on every promise that the trailer made, and more. The basic setup is that FBI agents Carruthers (Ray Liotta) and Messner (Ryan Reynolds) get wind of a plot by ancient mob boss Primo Sparazza (Joseph Ruskin) to kill his longtime rival Buddy 'Aces' Israel (Jeremy Piven). The payoff for the job is so huge that all the best hired guns in the business want in on the job, and they will kill each other and compete to the max to get it -- all while the FBI is trying to stop them. The assassins include Georgia Sykes (Alicia Keys) and her friend Sharice Watters (Taraji Henson), the Tremor brothers, (Kevin Durand, Maury Sterling and Chris Pine), and Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan). This huge setup culminates in one of the most violent gun battle scenes in years, all taking place at the Nomad Hotel in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.What an amazing movie. The setup is perfect, the climax scene is amazing, and I really cared about some of the characters. There were times when I was rooting for certain people (even assassins) to make it out of the whole situation alive, and for certain other people to kick the bucket in a violent and/or disgusting fashion. If/when you see the movie, it'll be pretty obvious which characters you want to survive and which you want to see gunned down, which makes the movie even more fun. When I was rooting for these guys to go one way or another, I realized that this is an emotion that I don't really get when watching movies nowadays: I cared. Alicia Keys is spot on, as are Tommy Flanagan, Ray Liotta, and Jeremy Piven as the depraved, drugged-up and sexed-up target of all the assassins. But what I really want to talk about is Ryan Reynolds.I lost a lot of respect for Reynolds after I saw Waiting... . I could just see Reynolds beginning to morph into that Adam Sandler/Ben Stiller/Will Ferrell kind of comedy guy that never does serious movies and can't exactly act, but can just be funny. But here, wow...Reynolds demonstrates that he can carry and even steal the show as the conflicted and tormented Agent Messner who has to lose his partner in the shootout and has some serious psychological issues in the fallout. I won't say anymore here, but suffice to say the massive twist and dramatic ending of the movie as a lot to do with Reynolds' character and his ability to pull off such an emotional scene. If you saw Waiting... too and were sort of put off by Reynolds' role, this movie will restore your faith.Simply amazing movie, with great setup, exemplary special effects, likable (and hateable) characters, and an amazing twist at the end that will leave you thinking, ""Is this movie real, or just an awesome dream?"" It's that good.",Smokin' Aces

210,tsasa198,"Come for the Chainsaw, Stay for the Chainsaw",4,10 February 2007,"I don't care how many critics hated this film (as of this writing it is sitting pretty at 27% on Rotten Tomatoes), I was not going to be deterred. If they were promising a frenzy of all star assassins racing to capture the bounty on the head of some slime ball played by Jeremy Piven then I was in. It also looked like they were willing to throw in some over the top Tarantino-ish flair and the coup de grace, a scene where somebody sits down on a running chainsaw. So I went and now I wished I had listened to that darned tomato meter. What I found was one of the messiest, self-indulgent plots in recent memory. I fully expected sensationalism, but I certainly didn't it expect it served up without the entertainment value. There are brief flashes of fun, but mostly it is just one big waste. A waste of talent, a waste of film, and a waste of time.But really I don't mind the waste of director Joe Carnahan. Making ""Narc"" as good as it was was probably just a ploy to get to direct commercial garbage like this. I do, however, mind the waste of Jeremy Piven. It all starts off AOK with his character. Granted it is suspiciously similar to the one he plays on ""Entourage,"" but that role made him who he is today so why not. We see him living a life that can only be described as a sleaze ball's deepest fantasy. A penthouse filled with naked hookers lying on the floor grasping at their bongs with drugs, money, and guns fill up the rest of the space. He then gets to deliver some very Ari-like lines, but then disappears into a role that asks him to walk around stoned, unaware of the world around him. Alicia Keys is also there (much to the delight of Bob Dylan), and even though she is probably the most likable character she really is nothing more than the sum of her parts. The nonsensical plot races itself to the finish, trying oh so hard to give a 13 year old boy anything he could possibly want. So considering that I thought all movies tried to pander to that demographic I am surprised this one has only done so so at the box office thus far. In the end, I can only recommend this film if your idea of a good time is sitting in a theater and hooting at anything that tickles your reptilian brain. Other than that there is no real reason to even consider watching this crap.Sorry if this review feels a little flat, I just was left feeling incredibly uninspired by this film. The bright spot, for me, was the numb chuck wielding 7 year old and his cluelessly permissive grandma. I was left wondering what I would do if this maniacal little twerp was talking smack to me after I had just had my hand blown off and then left for dead in a lake. The film does get in some clever one liners but considering that it is trying to sell cool to the kids I would certainly hope so. It probably is all fun and games for Carnahan to take his victory lap by pretending to be Tarantino, but whatever happened to self control? The closest relative this movie has in the Tarantino library is ""Reservoir Dogs"" but that was actually a great film. It told funny jokes, paced itself, and earned its shock value. All shock value equals no shock value and is thus a waste of time. And I say all this as someone who wishes there was more violence in movies. **",Smokin' Aces

213,hallgrahamb,Just pure enjoyment,9,13 June 2020,"I've watched this film about six times over the past decade now and enjoyed it each time. Yes, the story and dialogue are written for a serious movie while the action and sequences are more over-the-top theatrics with random humor sprinkled in the scenes. But this does not make it a bad film. The seriousness of the tone seems to mesh, albeit it could be better, with the action and humor. The movie should definitely receive credit for an somewhat original plot and style. Additionally all the great actors in it give good to great performances, which is refreshing to see as some too tier actors, hmm Bruce Willis, may be inclined to phone it in for this type of movie.In fact, the best thing about my most recent viewing is seeing all the actors whose careers have taken off since this film. That alone is worth a viewing. And granted, a bunch of actors who later became does not make the film great in itself.What makes this film pretty darn good is how the story is unique, there is a good amount of action, it is serious but understands its place so as not to be too serious, and the score/background music is perfect for the key scenes.The one area where the film struggles is the end. Up to the end, it has blended a serious plot with humor and over-the-top theatrics, but at the conclusion of the film it becomes a suddenly very serious film with a somewhat depressing end. By the time you finish, you are almost expecting another scene just to resolve this stark shift in tone. But alas, there isn't.My advice, don't watch it with any expectations. And don't expect a overly serious film nor a pure action film. If you go in wanting or expecting either one, you may be disappointed.

Very snappy it was too. Although the technique works well when trying to sell a service in 90 seconds, in applying it to a movie the makers seem to have overlooked the fact that they are supposed to be telling a story. In fact what we are left with is a device for quickly, shuffling through a large number of plot points without really engaging the audience (unless they're on some kind of illegal stimulant). As a result we find ourselves unceremoniously dumped in the middle of movie and expected to pick up the numerous threads, concerning characters which have had scant development and for which we have little interest. In fact the whole raison-d'etre for this cinematographical hotch-potch is to quickly get us to the complicated gore-fest in the dying seconds of the show.A better approach would have been to hand out briefing-leaflets before the movie, explaining what all the motivations of the various characters are.

Constant disregard for women, illicit drug use and lots of gun play. Screen favorites are the pseudo-lesbian duo of Georgia and Sharice (Alicia Keys & Taraji P. Henson) as the most professional hit-man duo with Sharice leveling a hotel floor with a 50mm machine gun in an attempt to free her partner from a precarious situation. Humorous appearances by Jason Bateman as a coked-out cross dressing lawyer, and the most ridiculous little boy missing his daily dosage of Ritalin you'll ever see.Bullets and body parts fly, and bodies pile up throughout 90% of the movie, and then suddenly it all comes crashing down with an over-dramatic, albeit non-violent climax that seems that it was trying to send a message rather than continue to please us with violent eye candy. The ending tricks us into believing the most hideous act is about to take place by using close-up camera angles and building thematic music, only to just simply mellow out and the credits roll.Despite the ending, Smokin' Aces is a great ride, full of every vice that makes going to these types of movies enjoyable for adults.",Smokin' Aces
224,RevengeOfBobRoss,Great fun movie!,8,7 February 2007,"Smokin' Aces delivers exactly what the previews showed. It's a fast paced, frenetic, guns a blazin' action/thriller.Aces Israel is a famous Vegas entertainer who gets caught up in the mob. The FBI wants him to testify against the mob in exchange for immunity against his crimes. A hit is put out on Aces, and a plethora of colorful hit men race to get to him before the FBI does.Two gangsta sniper girls, three inbred neo-nazi brothers, a torture master, and a man of a thousand faces are all after poor Israel, as is a group of ex-cops led by a bail-bondsman.Needless to say, the fast pace leads to some ""what?"" moments, and lead me to wish for a rewind button in the theater. But if you can keep up, the plot and rich characters make for an insanely fun time. The whole film is basically lead up to a final showdown, which culminates in a surprisingly melodramatic ending. Probably the biggest knock for me is the last 15 minutes. It's a good ending, but it doesn't feel like it belongs with the rest of the film.Overall, it's a good action film with an amazing cast and some great shootouts.8/10.",Smokin' Aces

In first 2 minutes you get that ""There's a guy who should be dead!"" And thats whole point of movie. In last 10 minutes you got pretty lousy, and expected, turn over and pathetic ending! And rest of the movie, about more than hour and half, you got running, jumping, killing, explosions, blood everywhere, few good jokes and bunch of bad ones.... I know that there is a lot of people who can enjoy just in action but Im not that type of guy. I hate James Bond... At beginning I wanted to watch this movie because of Common, since he's one of my favorites rap artist, secondly... Alicia! I'm don't like to listen to her as much as I love to look at her... but I can't tell anything about their acting since there is no characters... Everyone just running around. So it's hard to tell anything about some acting! So if I would said anything about actors that would be probably something from their other movies!

The screenplay was fantastic. joe Carnahan, haven't heard bout him before, but this is one classy movie. Iam not a fan of blood and gore, but this movie's got an intellectual twist. Highly recommended.I mean TOTALLY TOTALLY RECOMMENDED WATCH. Ryan Reynolds proves once more his caliber in acting. He displays seriousness and the emotions of a cop quite beautifully.

227,red_hyro,Where's the beef in this story?,4,4 May 2007,"This film is not lacking in flash or skill as regards its editing, cinematography, or even performances. But where is the plot? I kept hoping something would happen, and there would be character development, but it just didn't occur. There is way too much time spent setting up the plot: a mob boss is going to snitch, and cops and killers are dispatched to the penthouse where he is staying in order to get him. That's over thirty minutes in which nothing happens, merely indications something eventually will transpire. Then the first act occurs: they all show up and shoot each other, while the snitch mopes around upstairs and performs card tricks. The second and third acts were apparently abandoned in favour of a super-neato twist which doesn't matter because it concerns people we don't care about. Same goes for the few betrayals and relationships formed in the course of the film: since nothing led up to them or happened after they occur, they don't mean anything.A good plot actually develops the characters, while the ostensible main character of the film, the FBI agent played by Ryan Reynolds, remains a cardboard cut-out. The director, who seems to be too busy trying to be cool (as opposed to just focusing on telling a story while being cool, ala Tarantino) with nifty cuts and one-note idiosyncratic characters to actually bother with the story, is clearly thinking that when Ryan's character is sitting in the hospital room at the end of the film, we the audience are suppose to be feeling his pain and turmoil. But why would we? He hasn't actually done anything but shown up to hotel, find out his partner has been killed and that their assignment was a moot point. Oh and he lets some injured killers go, because it's just one of those days and they seem like nice folk. Where are the choices and actions that define who this guy is and lead to consequences and problems he has to overcome? If there has actually been a plot, he could have developed relationships and undergone trials along the way, making us identify and care about him by the end. As it is, who could possibly gives a rat's ass about anybody in this film? I've had more intimate relationships with characters trying to get a nasty stain out of their favorite shirt in a thirty-second commercial.I would have been down for an entire story, with a beginning, middle and end, which at the pace of this director would have taken at least four hours. As it is, we have a boring Macguffin in the form of coked-out magician/mobster (always a dynamite combo), a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing, and an ending that reveals even the main character has given up on being in a good movie and decided to end the raison d'etre of whatever was motivating everyone to act by pulling the metaphoric and literal plug. What makes the film so interesting is just how horribly it lacks the basic building blocks of a story, which hasn't changed much since Aristotle wrote about it in The Poetics.",Smokin' Aces
228,MakoSucks,"2 hours of dramatic piano music, and men crying.",1,4 February 2007,"The trailer for this movie shows a dude firing off two skorpion sub machine guns . That was the only good part about this movie. The rest of this movie is talking! When the actual gunshots do begin, it comes off so lame.Here's an example. A sniper is firing from one end to the other on an L shaped hotel at FBI agents armed with usp pistols, with a 50 bmg rifle. The agents are about 2 city blocks away from the sniper. the agents, turn towards the shot out window, and fire their pistols, without knowing which window on this 50 story building the fire is actually coming from. What does one of the agents do when out of ammo? He chucks the gun at the sniper. A snipoer being two city blocks away from him.The rest of the movie is men crying to dramatic piano music, and everyone dying. There is only 2 characters in this movie who you may consider good people. The rest are just hit men, and they all die, including one good character.Now when some of these people die, it is presented in a very sad event, but none of this movie makes you care for any character, so its as if some random henchman died, and they are playing another dramatic piano score. Even Ray Liota dies in this movie, and you don't even feel bad about it. What a waste of a great actor.Basically though, the only good parts about this movie is the scene with the guy firing the 2 skorpion smgs and the 3 ""neo nazi"" characters, who look like they should of been in Mad Max, But all those things can be found outside of paying money to see this mindless Hollywood dribble. the Skorpion scene is in the trailer, the neo Nazis can be found in Roadwarrior.

229,johnfrancisco1987,Enjoyable - but doesn't quite come together,6,24 January 2007,"It's becoming increasingly difficult to make a slick gangster film without being, perhaps unfairly, measured against Scorcese, Tarantino and the best of the best. And while this movie does cover a lot of familiar ground, it also manage to pull a surprise or two - who honestly saw Ben Affleck getting it so early on? - and is far superior than last year's mystifyingly highly rated ""Lucky Number Slevin"".Perhaps the downfall of the movie is that it can't decide if it's a comedy (the Tremors etc) or a serious, slick, gangster movie with a twist. It ends up falling in that uncomfortable territory in the middle.The dialogue was patchy, but did manage a few good one-liners. Overall the cast did a decent job with what they were given. Ryan Reynolds was excellent, as always. He again showed he deserves much better roles than he's thus far been given. Jason Bateman's cameo was by far the highlight of the movie.Worth watching purely for Andy Garcia's attempt at a human accent. At least I think it was human.",Smokin' Aces
230,brimblemeister,"Decent Movie....Not great, but decent",7,15 January 2007,"Think the score sums up the movie quite well, not immense like the departed by all means but still entertaining for sure. The acting was decent, Reynolds although no where near Oscar worthy made a reasonable switch from teen comedy to the more intense action film. Liotta was consistent, as was Garcia as always.Granted there are a few plot holes in the story, without giving any spoilers away, but if you can overlook these then I think you'll find the film worth watching.Me and my friends think the writers may have got a little caught up with the complexity of the script which kind of made it little less entertaining, it wasn't direct enough for me, the Departed (sorry to compare all the time) was direct, simple and intense, this had some intensity, but seemed to get a little lost at times.If you love gun fights and brutal action then the shooting scenes will astound you! they are brutal and probably the best part of the film. Blood, bullets and Alicia Keys, she was piping in this film!!

Instead I got a train wreck with nearly no entertainment value.This movie is to action what showgirls is to sex. Even though this is one of the most violent movies I've seen, there is no ""action"" and I just didn't care about any of it, much the same way that showgirls could have naked women on the screen the whole time and make it boring.Every 5 minutes someone walks in and shoots every one in the room. That's the ""action"". Most of the time you have no idea why they did it and it doesn't seem to fit into the story at all. This is not cool, stylish, over the top shootouts, hong Kong style, it's just ""walk in the room and shoot everyone"".There is about 10 times as much plot as is needed and it's incredibly convoluted and dumb, and I'm talking ""WTF"" dumb. There are so many characters, and some of the people are in the film for 5-10 minutes. People die and I'm thinking ""who was that?"". Someone kills a dozen innocent people, for no reason that I can figure out, and then literally a second later there's sad music telling us we're supposed to sympathize with them, again for no reason that I can see.There is about 10 minutes of funny dialog, and the actors where all pretty good. it's just that there was nothing for them to do.",Smokin' Aces

It was like Crank meets the Departed (I liked both, especially the latter) but still... this movie was just too stupid at some points.I would have given this movie a 3 or 4 but my friends liked it a lot so I'm giving it a 5 because my lack of admiration could be because of taste.",Smokin' Aces

Unsure who is going to survive, unsure of what would actually stop the bad guys, unsure who is a good guy. Unsure of how much gore they are going to subject me to. I was covering my eyes half the time. It was great. I even felt it had a few throw backs to the genre. (The chainsaw, the torture, the Stephen King like family in the woods...) It has a twisted plot of sorts. A bit hard to keep up with, but they repeat nearly everything said. And smart people will guess the obvious surprises, but ain't nobody seeing the morally twisted end coming.Everyone was a great scene stealer.

The story is totally horrible. The movie cannot focus on any given piece of itself for more than a minute and that really does hurt it.Of course there are some laughs involved and acting is rather mediocre...Ben Affleck as ""star"" for this movie is pretentious as he has about 4 minutes of screen-time only.The only good thing is that Alicia Keys doesn't fail as an actress and does a nice job.3 out of 10.And yes I've seen it in English.",Smokin' Aces

The movie is full of twists and turns, surprising at every scene, totally edge of the seat. I was disappointed to see the IMDb rating and after I watched it I thought is as an injustice. The same happened with tears of the sun although i liked this one better than that. All the characters are awesome. The real show stealer for me was Martin Henderson. He doesn't appear more often but every time he appears, leaves an unerasable mark in the memory. If I would watch it for the second time, it would be definitely for him (although there are million other reasons). Another strong character was that of Reynold's. He proves his maturity at acting. Ray is as usual his best. All others have done a descent (spl reference to the neo-nazi group) job and full credit to the creators. Once in a while you see a film like this. There are small stories intervened, the connections between one and the other creates a way for others to connect.

236,Snowman_Mcknives,An entertaining bullet bonanza that over reaches itself,7,14 June 2007,"Smokin' Aces sounds like a dream come true: a plot that promises fast moving action, a quirky, interesting cast, a director that made one of the best crime films of recent years, and a schizophrenic visual style. does it work? more or less.Jeremy Piven is a tool: a magician who has run foul of the mob after taking his connection to them a little seriously. The FBI pick up on a plot to have him killed, as does the underworld. Before you know it, a bunch of assassins varied enough to make up two entire anime series are on the case: bumbling bail bondsman, psychotic crime commando neo-Nazis, black lipstick lesbians, masters of disguise, and a mysterious ""Swede"" (you always know the real badasses in action movies: they don't have real names). So all these guns are pointed at Piven, and for the first forty minutes, all is going well. The tension mounts as the various players place their pieces.Then, chaos steadily erupts on multiple floors of the hotel where Piven is staying, and staggering amounts of violent death occur in the second 40 minutes. There are some humorous touches (Jason Bateman as a cross dressing, STD ridden lawyer, a feminist rant by one of the assassins) and a bunch of hipper than thou cameos (most of which come across as fun rather than being simply for the sake of it) but ultimately, this is a nasty crime flick played for thrills. As the death toll rises, mostly in short, sharp encounters, the film keeps the pedal to the floor.Ultimately, the threads are tied off, and the gunfire subsides, and this is where the film flounders. If one stops at the last gunshot, one might be forgiven for thinking it is a simply a crime caper crossed with an action movie then pumped up on PCP. However, the film tries to turn socially relevant in the last few minutes, delivering a message. Though, with the script so focused on exotic types of bloodshed for most of its length, this comes across as forced, and tacked on. The emotional ending will more leave the viewer scratching their head, and sours the taste of all the hyper cool violence, making it look self conscious.Ultimately, good fun, but ends up wanting to be taken seriously, which doesn't work.",Smokin' Aces
237,bumbletbw,"Decent Premise, Schizoid Execution",3,26 January 2007,"Some big-mouthed, coke-head Wayne Newton of the American mob world is moving to make a coup on the king. So, on his deathbed, the ailing Don puts a million dollar contract on the schmuck to the person that brings him his heart. The FBI is looking to take the upstart, Buddy ""Aces"" Israel (Jeremy Piven), into custody to bring down the mob on this side of the Atlantic. Israel's lawyer hires bail bondsmen to drag him back to Vegas to negotiate with the feds. Meanwhile, word leaks of the seven figure bounty and several of the world's craziest and brazen hit men descend on Lake Tahoe and his supposedly discrete penthouse locale to collect, dead or alive. Mayhem ensues. Sound interesting? It isn't.What sounds as though it could have had the potential to be a slick, stylish mob and/or action film falls flat on its face because it has absolutely no idea in which direction it wants to go. Is it a mob film? Is it a shoot 'em up? Is it a comedy, or are we supposed to be in suspense? Are we just supposed to be awestruck by the various absurd arsenals of deception and large-calibre weaponry of our barely introduced assassins? Who is the focus of this picture? The dying Don? The FBI and its agents? The hit men? Buddy Israel? The answer? There isn't one.The movie bounces around between several dozen characters whilst everyone descends on Tahoe. Once they get there all hell breaks loose, and it ends in an incomprehensible, bloody mess and what little semblance of a plot looses all momentum. Then to top it all off, Joe Carnahan - the writer and director - tosses in a bit of a morality tale, trying to turn it all into an allegory of America's current foreign policy.The fact of the matter is that this movie tries to be so many different things simultaneously, that it isn't really anything. The story isn't clever, it certainly isn't cohesive, and the characters are flatter than the paper the dialog was written on - to no fault of the actors. There's a saying about a silk purse and a sow's ear that applies here. Jeremy Piven gives us the best performance in the film for two reasons: One, he's a talented performer. Two, he's the only one with enough screen time and background with which the audience is remotely able to connect.People want to compare this to Tarantino. Don't. Think more along the lines of Tony Scott on amphetamines directing a bad combination of Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World with a hackneyed Usual Suspects twist ending.The bottom line here is that no matter what you think you're going to get with this picture, you're probably only going to get about five minutes of it.

238,kkhannah,Best when the guns are blazing.,6,23 July 2012,"Some films benefit greatly from jumping genres and styles with every other scene; Kill Bill Volume 1 and Moulin Rouge (to a lesser extent) specifically come into my mind. However, when it comes to Smokin' Aces, the attempts at genre spanning only create a massive mess of bloody shootouts, humor and an attempt at a serious plot that seems to belong to an entirely different movie. The film is at its best when the focus is relatively simple, when the plot can really be summed up as, ""Kill Buddy Israel."" And the cast certainly has fun attempting to do just that, with Chris Pine putting in a hammy, campy performance as one third of a set of Neo-Nazi brothers and Common performing quite well in his first film. But with so many characters, it is all too easy to get confused or simply forget who each person is working for and what their motivation is. Quite simply, with so many assassins gunning for Buddy Israel (played to hysterics by Jeremy Piven), it gets hard to care about more than a few or, indeed, any of them. I'm the first to admit that my guilty pleasure is 'dumb' action films and as a result, I found Smokin Aces most enjoyable when the guns were blazing. The shootouts are completely over the top, occasionally bordering on the absurd, but they are a heck of a lot of fun to watch. If the film had stuck to this formula for more of the running time, I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more. However, by the time the film ended, I was wondering if I'd accidentally switched channels half way through. With a convoluted back story and a depressing ending, the genre switch is jarring. Overall, while the film is certainly an enjoyable distraction for awhile, it tries to cover too many areas at once, making half-hearted attempts at action, drama and violence and the mixture of serious and absurd moments make for a bad aftertaste. Watch once, then move on to something else.",Smokin' Aces

Jackson set out to make ""Snakes on a Plane"" he repeatedly expressed he wanted to make the kind of movie he would pay to see. ""Smokin' Aces"" is that movie. The pace is fast, the acting is always credible and solid, and the blood comes wholesale by the gallon. Yes there are minor flaws throughout the movie (mostly continuity, some plot holes) but the beauty of this film is that the audience is so wound up in wanting to see how all the players will catastrophically collide with each other that these mistakes can be easily overlooked.""Smokin' Aces"" is the ultimate guys film; it's the cracked-out offspring of methodically ultra-violent titles like Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Training Day and the like. Anyone who is sick of the cancerous spread of Hollywood's fat free cookie cutter PG-13 action and horror titles (The Transporter, The Ring...) should willingly devour every calorie filled bite of this obnoxiously violent bullet fest. The storyline is original but never tries too hard to be hip or smart, despite having more A-List actors than Paris Hilton's Blackberry no single character steals the show and, best of all, every single character is as likely to catch a bullet as 50 Cent's entourage.With any hope for the future of violence in Hollywood this movie will overcome the negative reviews of art house critics who only condone violence in the historical sense (like The Passion of the Christ and Saving Private Ryan). If viewers remain absent at the box office like they were for Snakes, then we might as well all be content to tuck it between our legs and rent The Notebook, because the bullets, blood and masochism which used to come synonymous with the action genre might as well have a million-dollar bounty on its head as well; it'll be as good as dead.",Smokin' Aces

The film doesn't try to be anything else but in the genre of lock stock & 2 smoking barrels but without as much comedy and capers. All the characters are straight forward and un-complicated, and are all armed with guns which is great since really its just cops v's baddies. Its not that slow to start with and all films with a build up to a big action sequence near the end follow the same route.

However, I can see where the changing in moods and style throughout the movie can aggravate some people. The movie has a very unique way of killing off characters that should have important roles, and the movie lets you see into those characters lives and then all of a sudden they vanish and never re appear in the movie..

And this doesn't address the many incidental characters who wander in and out of the flick, like the karate kid with ADHD.*SPOILER* But instead of being content with the wall to wall carnage that is the middle portion of Smokin' Aces, the writers unnecessarily complicate the film with a sub-plot about organ transplants and hereditary links. It's so foolish, even in what is essentially a foolish film, that it's distracting. The plot twists around in crazy directions chasing its own tail.But don't let that put you off. If you're an action film fan, even the ridiculous resolution won't spoil it for you.",Smokin' Aces
248,calloused_viewer,This movie rattles when you shake it,4,18 February 2007,"That's because it's pretty hollow! I wanted to see this flick since it came out because I like action films. I like blood and guts and killing and guns and machines like hot cars and motorcycles. And I can suspend judgment if necessary on cheesy characters or plot holes when there's going to be some other kind of payoff.The Movie started off slow, showed some promise around the time Affleck and crew get drive-bye-byed, but, then the film comes to a slow, clunking halt. The weird East German/Irish-scar-face guy just kind of stands around, waiting for other people to show up. Piven's character, Buddy Aces, spends most of the film crying into his hands. Alicia Keys' character stands around in a lobby, waiting for an elevator, when she could have just taken the stairs to go up to kill Aces, or to even go down to escape, at anytime. The security detail on Aces' floor stand waiting for an elevator, and, when it starts to come finally, it has smoke pouring out of it. And they just wait for it. I don't know: maybe this is a bad sign, people? And that's how I felt: I felt like all of these individuals were just waiting around. I've waited before: it's not fun. Watching others wait is not exactly fun either.",Smokin' Aces
249,harrywarren1998,A good action film,7,11 February 2012,"I personally enjoyed this film. A film about lots of assassins going after one man is a good action storyline. This film had a good cast and great action scenes. Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds are a good duo in this film and Jeremy Piven is great as his role. At times it can be quite cheesy and unoriginal .The biggest letdown for me was the last scene. I just don't understand why it happened and I thought it was a silly ending. I thought there were some good twists and shocks in this film and you don't know what's going to happen next. I was surprised to see Jason Bateman in this film, his role was good and left you laughing.Overall this is a good film and worth watching.",Smokin' Aces
250,zzmasta,"Fun, Exciting - Watch this Film",9,9 February 2007,"9/10 for Smokin' Aces, the new action/drama starring Jeremy Piven.This movie won't get onto the top 250, nor will it win any Oscars. It will be bashed for its ""copying"" of other movies' styles, themes, etc... but in reality, Smokin' Aces is a hip, cool and violent action movie that is told in almost a story-mode, and then extends itself into the usual movie mode where events are just told through seeing them. No spoilers, but I'll give the basic plot: Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is a washed up hotshot from Las Vegas who was in the mob and now is in trouble with the FBI. To ensure he is let off the hook, he offers to give up the names of some of his co-mobsters. The mob boss sends a universal contract to kill Israel and get his heart (literally). The prize is a cool million, and there are several hit men looking to get the job done.Jeremy Piven as Aces is perfect. Playing a dramatic prick (sometiems similar to his role as Ari on Entourage) and later on an emotionally battered, washed-up wreck - Piven shows his quality. This movie is in limited release, but I think ultimately Piven has made a good choice by taking this movie. He has a great range of emotion, everything felt authentic, and he made me laugh, cry, and everything in between.Ultimately, see this if you are into action movies, things like Sin City, Kill Bill - lots of violence but an intelligent plot to it as well (though some would argue that the plot was retarded, I found it cool). It is under 2 hours, the movie goes by at a blazing pace, and by the end you are impressed with a smile on your face. Definitely one of the coolest movies I've seen of late, and it's a shame directors don't have the snazz to make 'em like this anymore. The closest thing you can relate it to is Snatch/Lock Stock Two Smoking Barrels, but this one has a lot more blood, gore, guns, guts and naked ladies (hence the 18A rating, at least here in Canada).If you enjoy a good action flick, something fun, go see it. You won't be disappointed.",Smokin' Aces
251,sarahalub,"oh Ray, how you have stooped....",1,12 January 2007,"Ray Ray Ray....did 'Revolver' teach you nothing?? For a man who was once in a Scorsese movie, its hard to imagine he'd end up like this....sunk to depths of the lowest degree. Well hopefully the reviews this film will no doubt receive will teach Mr. Liotta a thing or two about 'money over credibility', because this film is enough to suffocate anyone's career. (And Affleck should be ashamed of himself... wasn't 'Gigli' enough of a lesson!!!READ the Scripts in future Ben)'Now thats what i call gangsters 2006'Possibly a more fitting title for such a dire film. Please allow me to elaborate Think of possibly every single 'villian' cliché in cinematic history, presented to us in a rapid 'MTV' style manner, all after one guy, and all introduced to us within the first ten minutes of the film.You've got Ace, (the guy they wanna kill because he double crossed the mafia, or something along those lines....it all becomes a blur after a while), the million members of the mafia (nice of them to explain what 'La Cosa Nostra' stands for right at the start, and then fail to explain anything else from that point onwards). and then comes the villainsIn no particular order:Some guy who takes on the deranged Hannibal lecter type character, (you gotta have the psycho), followed by the redneck Neo-Nazi brothers with the 'Mad Max' style attire, (and the inconspicuous chainsaws....discreet), Alisha Keys makes an appearance as the 'badass' street talking contract killer (thus bringing a more urban flavour to whole melting pot), you've got the eastern European master of disguise (who makes faces out of latex, and disguises himself as his dead victims...cunning)and a few other characters (who you soon forget about)...headache is the only way of describing this intro.After half an hour you're still probably as perplexed as you where within the first five minutes, because nothing is clarified (fine...a linear narrative, as we know is not the be and and end of all of films), but some kind of coherence is surely a must.Anyway in an over the top (being an understatement) way they all go to bring ace back to the mafia, trying to each get there before anyone else. The big twist (i say twist, although i really failed to care by this point), comes at the end when you find out the truth about why the mafia wanted ace really.OK heres what i don't get:The man who makes the faces from latex.....how on earth did he manage to kill Hugo, mould the guys face, let it dry, put it on, (powder it up with a bit of makeup), and get a wig identical to Hugo's actual hairdo...all in the space of what appeared to be no more than 10 minutes!Alisha keys' character.....runs off with that guy who worked for Ace, after about 2 seconds of meeting him, and allows her 'friend' to get gunned down by police, whilst shes outside with prince charming arranging a date location!rather unfair.. and WHY was she not arrested????why were there another lot of prostitutes coming to aces penthouse when about 6 had just left! has this man never heard of chlamydia!This whole thing was very very laughable,especially the last part of the film with the '90's action movie' style blowing up and gunning down of everything in sight.I'm sure this movie wishes it was a Tarentino, because it tries so hard to be cool...but we all know that when you try too hard it shows. It upsets me that people are even trying to find comparisons between this movie and 'Goodfellas', because its like comparing a Mcdonalds to fine French cuisine.In Liotta's defence however, he was possibly the best thing about this mess of a movie. He just wasted his talents on such a bad movie.",Smokin' Aces
252,hersh-mail,Beware the hangover...,4,12 June 2008,"When i saw Narc, i made a mental note to make sure to check out the next film of Joe Carnahan. I had got Smokin' Aces lying around since sometime but had forgotten about it, what it was about and who had made it. And as i do often, i just popped it in without even looking at the informations available, telling myself that if it was there, it's because i had gotten it for a reason. All this to say i just watched it through without knowing it was the ""next Carnahan film"". It hurts even more since it could make Narc now seem like an accident...All the reviews have given the plot, so there's no sense in repeating it, but i must repeat that it is a mess. The thing with stories as convoluted as this is that they better be bullet proof or otherwise it's just not worth it. If you can't keep it together and be awed by it even after a second time through, tone it down. Simplify. If you can't start a film without spending the 5 first minutes of it to explain everything that has happened which will lead to what will happen, simplify. The unpleasant thing is that here, you are first fooled by the amount of information given during the first minutes into thinking that this could be something intelligent, and after that it goes from excitement to deception up until the anti- climax that makes you regret the whole endeavor, like a bad date that you never really wanted to bring home for the night but just couldn't help yourself after a surreal evening of drinking, even though all the while *you just knew* that you shouldn't.I already felt cheated during the film : the Mad Max-Nazi trio that go around half-naked killing everybody and carrying chainsaws and generators while invisible to everybody in the world, the Houdini/Hannibal crossover who just *loves* to torture and who's capable of making real-life-defying latex masks of his victims on the fly, a couple of girls that seem themselves surprised to get a contract like this, and a bunch of losers that were there just to fill in the gaps. Liotta and Reynolds do OK as FBI Agents but seem pretty sketchy. The time-span problem in the scenario has already been mentioned by many, it's like scenes are just suspended in time so as to be able to come back to them and not miss a thing whereas it is supposed to be happening all at once. And then there're the unnecessary fillings (scenes that go nowhere - dialog that doesn't mean anything : the kid, the rant at the reception, the dancing Nazis that nobody shoots at, the last shooting on the roof etc.). All this without mentioning some way too easy killings and other unlikely survivals. But hey, i like all kinds of movies, and the photography was nice and Alicia Keys was hot, and a few scenes just really flowed (i loved the build-up to the big shooting scene with Alicia). So, OK, after the initial deception, i was ready to be indulgent and just take what was there to be taken, even if it would not add up to too much. Entertain me. But if it was to be a mindless action-comedy, it sure would have needed some more spectacular action, not to mention the humor. So there i was, nearing the end, waiting for it to go through the roof in a massive confrontation between everybody still alive, let's have it in the real over-the-top fashion shall we... except that it was already over and what i just saw *was* the final confrontation, and it was now time to explain everything, to make ""the end"" as intelligent as the beginning wanted to let you believe. And boy, even if i was dreading to have guessed the most of it, i just couldn't believe it. And that's when it all fell face-down, from crippled to clinically dead, from mindless to idiotic, from entertainment to abuse. It was worse a cheat than the ever-famous ""it was only a dream"", in that it just doesn't work in any level. And like this would not be of enough insult against the spectator, the final act of Agent Messner makes his ""friend's/partner's"" sacrificial death totally useless as well. Everything loses ground. The explanation given just sinks the film further down the drain, works against it, and denies it the little amusement that it had left. Unless of course the point was that there's no point. Or that i took it way too seriously. Or not enough. Or that i just didn't ""get"" it..?What i *did* get is that, in the end, it's not an action-comedy (not enough action nor comedy), nor it's a ""noir"" (not believable for a second), and it's not really cool (too air- headed and dumb) even though it has the photo and some cool moments, and to top it all i kind of felt insulted by it's cheap trickery to try and make me believe it was all of those at once. And this is when i saw the name of the Director in the closing credits. I won't go on any further, but needless to say i was shocked. I'll still give Carnahan a benefice of doubt (i really liked Narc) and will not tell you to avoid it at all cost, do have a look and make up your own mind. I've seen worse but i've seen a lot better as well, and am glad in a way that i discovered only in the end the name of Joe Carnahan because otherwise i think i would've been too sad to be able to finish it.4 out of 10, but 2 of it is in loving memory of Narc and in hoping that the next one will get Carnahan back on track, i'm sure he's still capable of great things.",Smokin' Aces

The premise of the movie is that there are a bunch of super-assassins trying to kill Jeremy Piven. The dialog is really bad. Jeremy Piven is a great actor, but even he couldn't save this thing. It was supposed to be snappy, but it all came off like it was trying too hard. The movie is really violent, but the action scenes aren't really that entertaining. The ending is awful and so contrived that I was surprised that this movie wasn't written by M. Night Shaylaman. The worst part of this movie is that there really isn't a hero to root for. Ryan Reynolds is just sort of getting shot at the whole time, and never really does anything notable. This movie is overkill. Too many villains who barely get developed before they die.

255,howerd,Quentin Tarantino has a lot to answer for,1,2 February 2007,"I won't say this is the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly the most annoying. With smug satisfaction dripping from every frame and a wholly unjustified confidence in its own (non-existent) cleverness, this is the cinematic equivalent of that pretentious art-school dropout who holds center-stage at a late-in-the-year graduate school party and makes you want to drag him out to the driveway and pummel him with rancid cheese. With action that's noisy rather than exciting, plot ""twists"" any third grade viewer of ""24"" could see coming ten miles away  (SPOILER coming up. It's right in the next line! Don't blame me if you actually want to see this movie. Blame yourself. --) Any chance that the two characters who are mentioned as having had plastic surgery might end up being the same character?! Also with fake cynical shocks (oh, wow big movie star killed in the first act  lucky for him), and attempts at humor that make Jar-Jar Binks look like Peter Sellers (The Tremor Brothers? Holy Christ, please pour the popcorn golden flavoring in my eyes before I have to see them anymore!), this is an mind-numbing exercise in everything that sucks about current cinema masquerading as an indie flick. And to make it even more offense, after all the fake hip Tarantino wannabe posturing (and don't get me wrong, I love KILL, BILL I even loved Neveldine and Taylor's CRANK) it actually expects us to take the characters seriously at the end and get all misty eyes about the fate of Alica Keys and about Ryan Reynolds' moral choices and getting misty eyed about anything to do with Ryan Reynolds may be asking too much for any audience.My favorite review of this one came from the Philadelphia Weekly; SMOKIN' ACES is ""the worst film of 1998.""",Smokin' Aces

Most films don't do a good enough job on character development, this happens to be one of this films strengths. That being said, the plot is so stupid that you'll walk away annoyed. The twist at the end is just dumb, and there were several scenes which could have been deleted without damaging the film. Apparently they never heard the phrase, less is more. They could have eliminated the ADD kid completely and they could have done without the useless rant about women at the hotel check-in scene.Another problem with the film was its pacing. The FBI are in a big rush to get to Buddy Israel before the assassins do, so they stop for lunch. Interesting sense of urgency to say the least. Also, they take the ""Company Lear Jet"" to get Israel, but land in Reno requiring a 2 hour drive instead of landing at the Lake Tahoe airport, which is designed for private planes and small commuter flights. A point I wouldn't have noticed if the rest of the film hadn't had similar plot problems.If the film makers had spent less time trying so hard to be hip they may have noticed the ridiculous flaws and been able to address them.

257,Diego_Flores,"""Smokin Aces= ""Smelly Feces""",1,9 February 2007,"Obviously from what I titled this review you can tell I hated the film. Just to let you know where I'm coming from crime/action/noir type movies are what I live for and are the only movies I enjoy watching. Whenever a new one hits theaters I greatly anticipate seeing it.Such was the case with Smokin Aces. I loved Joe Carnahan's last movie Narc. It was an amazing movie with a great script, great cast and great direction on Carnahan's part. Sadly Aces was absent of all those things.The script and plot seemed to come second to the action sequences, speaking of which didn't impress me either. What little plot there was reminded me of a cross between the Usual Suspects and True Romance. It especially seemed like Carnahan must have watched Usual Suspects one too many times and I saw several things he stole directly from other movies such as Mission Impossible III.As far as the characters go none of them were interesting. There was absolutely no character development of any kind or anyone to root for.The dialogue was absolutely forgettable and not one memorable line was mumbled throughout the whole film. This was a major disappointment considering some of the great dialogue in Narc.Don't even get me started on the cast. Ryan Reynolds was wrong for the role he played and Ray Liotta was underused. The two musicians he cast (Common and Alicia Keys) should have never been given a chance to act in the first place.I can't even believe the studio let him go ahead with this movie after reading the script. This is one of those films where a few years down the line Carnahan and the actors in it are going to admit it stunk.Let's hope Joe C. does something at least a little better next time.",Smokin' Aces

Think of Tarantino with a cross of running scared and lucky number slevin with a hint of guy ritchie-ness.Top notch performances by everyone. The film seems way longer than its running time.....mainly because the first hour is introducing all the characters and is abit long winded. The film is hard to follow and the story was far more complicated than it needed to be due to loads of talking leading up to the end and andy garcias mumbling...i didn't really know what was going on throughout the film apart from several assassins trying 2 kill this man. Half way through i thought it was going to be as boaring and over-hyped as Miami vice and the departed.This film isn't violent compared to others I've see......man on fire is more brutal than this there's a good 10minute shootout towards the end and one or two splats of blood along the way but nothing that shocked me anyway. Alicia keys stole the film in my opinion she was amazing and thank god she didn't play a singer. Also martin henderson was entetaining in this. Ryan Reynolds was amazing and seems to get better better in every film i see him in, although i prefer him in comedy.The last half an hour really saves the film due to the action and there's abit of a twist at the end.....but it didn't leave me shocked because i only just about understood what was going on but by the time I relised what had happened it wasn't bad.Apart from that just another forgettable over-hyped film, but wasn't bad.",Smokin' Aces

I could've accepted that this was mindless action movie if it weren't for the dialog. The movie will bore you to tears before it even reaches its first shootout (second if you count the flashback which was *talked* to death).Basically, the movie is mostly people trying to explain the plot to you over...and over...and over...and over again.

A fair bit of stylised action and gunplay but ultimately the story is a pretty weak one. The script didn't really seem sharp enough and doesn't compete with the likes of a Tarantino movie which it plainly is trying to imitate. There was far too much complex narrative both at the beginning and end of the movie to explain the set up and the conclusion ,with unfamiliar names being mentioned so fast and fleetingly that even Shirlock Holmes might have struggled to follow it.The ending I found was a little anticlimatical given the carnage that had gone before hand.

Throw in a few tight ass coppers and our hero and we have a movie.Yes parts of this film were stupid, parts were funny though they were not meant to be, but all in all the acting is strong throughout, the action scenes are pulled off very well and there are enough twists to keep those looking for a decent plot happy (including the death of big main character early on).

Or is this the racist reality projected onto the screens which then feeds the stereotype? Which came 1st African Americans calling themselves these stupid racist names or the names? In any event the dialog tries to be hipe and is just some white guy trying to dialog AA and profit from it. Keys doesn't belong in a film she belongs on a stage. her screen presence, unlike Common, in non-existent. It is also getting tiring see rappers and R&B artist in films, they r real AA actors out there, Please find them. The dialog I think is the worst, the AA with the big gun is just boring with her diatribes.

But this ain't it, it is pure wanna be without having the punch, the script to deliver anything that could be enjoyed. And I have more respect for original garbage than middle of the road copycat.

265,Terminator552,A Shoot-'em-up with a Cool Twist,7,21 April 2007,"I did not get the chance to see SMOKIN' ACES in theatres, but I did catch it on DVD, and it's a fun movie to watch. With all the loud music and cool cinematography, I would have liked to have seen this on the big screen. Nevertheless, it's still pretty good at home (if your home theatre owns like mine).Basically, this movie is about a washed-up Vegas performer named Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, who is making a deal with the FBI to snitch on a mafia he was a part of in exchange for protection and a new name in the witness protection program. Now, the dude in charge of the mob doesn't like this, so it's a race between a bunch of hit men to kill Israel before the cops can get to him. May the best hit-man win.This movie starts off pretty straightforward, but becomes very complicated. Each group of hit men have different back stories (many of them have really demented stories), and that adds to the plot. However, people talk quickly and things happen fast, and you start to lose track of who is doing what and why. But just enjoy it for what it is, you don't need all the details to totally get it.Now, this is a shoot-'em-up movie, so let's get to the action sequences. Surprisingly, there weren't many of them, and most of them occurred during the second half of the movie. But they were pretty awesome. Bloody, intense, and realistic, these scenes were what made the movie. They were very stylishly shot and if you're an action lover, it should leave you satisfied.This movie is not recommended for the little ones, as it contains a lot of profanity, some nudity, and some extremely brutal action sequences. For mature audiences, this movie has a lot to offer, including a really good twist ending that I did not expect but I really enjoyed. Recommended to all action movie lovers.",Smokin' Aces

Bad boys 2 was an action movie, completely predictable, but it was great. i am sure many of the critics here would love to see that movie a second time. but as for smokin' aces, like others before me have said, the attempt to wizen the plot just killed the hype and the grand finale, resulting with the following impression: Was that it?",Smokin' Aces

It also had a very well-rounded cast with a lot of familiar faces. Each character, and yes, even Ben Affleck, was interesting. I suppose if you're looking for a movie to shed light on man's inner search for meaning, or some other rhetorical quest like that, this movie might not be for you.

268,Drumski89,Good Action Movie,8,10 February 2007,"I thought it was a solid action movie, with some good unpredictability factors, with clever dialogue and good action scenes. However, it's a bit hard to follow and some of it needs to be explained if you miss even a few seconds of it. The movie started off well, and the standard showcasing of the hit-people was entertaining, especially the Lazlo Soot (Tommy Flanagan) portion. It progressed at a reasonable speed and when Jack Dupree (Ben Affleck) and his friend got wasted by the Tremors, I had to respect the fact that a star like Ben Affleck got killed early, it's not common to see that in a movie. The movie had a build up that didn't feel exactly right, as though there should have been more of it, but it seems to me that maybe it was cut for time reasons. Yet the ride up the elevators for all of the involved parties then seemed like it took too long to get to the top. It wasn't painfully long, but it could have had more lead up to the elevators, and less time in the elevators. The fighting scenes had good angles, and good realism in it, and the various fight segments all added well to the overall mayhem of the attempts on ""Aces""'s (Jeremy Piven) life. The twist that Soot was there only to kill the people there with ""Aces"" rather ""Aces"" himself was a clever idea, and then adding that to the fact the main bad guy had been betrayed by the FBI years early made for some good plot twisting. It seemed like they had to try to explain the plot to you too much, the film repeatedly shows the same information on a number of people, as though the filmmakers thought you'd be too stupid to follow the plot. The only part that's really tough to understand is keeping track of who everyone is, and who's dead and who's alive and who's dead. That's what you need to really pay attention to, because if you blink you might not know how somebody got where they got to, or how somebody died, or if they're even really dead. The only other flaw of the movie is the fact that there's so many characters that seem interesting, but they really don't get very much time in individually. This also contributes to the confusion that I previously mentioned. It's also why you're never quite sure who everyone one is. The movie is entertaining and exciting with all the other qualities I mentioned too, so these problems are too small to ruin the movie. It's a good movie; it's rather similar to Quentin Tarantino Movies and to Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and although it's not quite as good as those movies, it's certainly worth seeing in theaters",Smokin' Aces
269,malnatik9,"Comedy - NOT! Spoiler, Not sure, but do take heed.",1,27 January 2007,"This was by far the worst movie I have seen in years, and the trailer was wildly inaccurate as to what it would be like. Nearly everything in that trailer happened in the first half hour, and was carefully selected so as to not allow you ANY clue what you would be in for.I've never written one of these reviews before, but I feel completely ripped off, so I'm putting my warning up for your benefit. My husband and I have seen many violent movies, and we have no problem with some gratuitous gun play, but this movie presented itself as an Action/COMEDY! FUNNY?: This movie was many things, but funny was not one of them. It was incredibly violent. It was completely incoherent. It was sick and twisted - in such a way as to leave you feeling assaulted long after you left the theater. I saw it well over an hour ago, and I still can't wipe the grimace off my face. I very nearly left before it was over, but I kept waiting for the funny part, because my husband swore it would be funny.INCOHERENT!: At one point the movie cut from one scene on the highway, to another from a seemingly completely different movie (underwater) - without any explanation at all. I swear, I thought I fell asleep, because it made no sense at all to me, and even after the movie ended, my husband said he was lost as to what that was all about, too. I'm still lost.This may count as a SPOILER, I don't know, but DO NOT TAKE A KID TO THIS MOVIE! SICK!: You may like it if you're a pedophile, or a NAMBLA member, but for a brief while, completely out of context of the movie, the director seemed to want to insert a bit of child porn in there for some unexplained reason. It was completely unwarranted, and had NOTHING whatever to do with the plot. It was the kind of uncomfortable scene that just leaves your skin crawling. Not scary, just sick! That was when I wanted to leave the most, and I recommend you avoid this movie entirely, just based on those scenes.PLOT?: As to the actual plot, well, I suppose there is a plot - sort of, but really, the ""sort of"" plot goes off the rails pretty quickly, leaving you wondering what the heck is going on throughout most of the movie. The last few minutes attempt to tell you some reasonable explanation of why you were lost for the last hour, but frankly, who cares by then. As I said, this was supposed to be an action/comedy - not a mystery.The only mystery to me is why they bothered making this at all. This movie was bad, Really BAD, and do not assume the trailer bears any resemblance to what you're in for. That is not what this movie is about, and the only remotely ""funny"" scene in this whole mess is in that trailer. Not one person in the theater laughed out loud the entire movie, and by the time that one mildly amusing sight gag is played, you are so shell shocked, you will not likely laugh out loud, either.If you find yourself laughing at the trailer, save the money, you've already seen the best of it.Oh Yeah, if you're a fan of Jason Bateman (as I am), skip this movie. You won't be after, as his part is Infinitesimally small, and sickening.",Smokin' Aces
270,badvertisinguy,"Mean-spirited, dumbed-down Tarantino w/ no likable characters",4,1 February 2008,"Lukewarm Tarantino-wannabe without the wit or brains but lots of needless violence. Dozens of characters charge about, insulting and shooting each other, but there's really nobody to root for, and the climactic massive shootout is interesting to watch technically, but not involving emotionally, since we really don't care who makes it and who doesn't. Jeremy Piven is believable as the target, but is such a charismatic-free jerk that we hardly care what happens to him, and the larger scale import of his survival -- so he can testify against the mob -- never resonates. A few plot twists are tossed in at the end, but none of them make sense. In fact, the whole movie doesn't carry much logic, despite a number of overlong scenes of expository dislodge.",Smokin' Aces

I like the different personalities of the hitmans. I think this movie is underrated and it deserver's more credit that it got.

272,icanseehimrightnow,Smokin' Aces: Not quite there...,6,21 June 2010,"This review will definitely contain spoilers as I will go into detail. Just a warning if you missed the other one. I wanted to watch this movie because I wanted to take a break from what I usually watch and wanted some over the top action. Now I know that people can call me ignorant for not liking a movie for what I wanted it to be, but it did drop below my expectations. And if you don't like my review then don't read it.So, the movie starts and 2 guys are sitting in a van. What are they saying? I don't know, because I can't pay attention. I usually have a good attention span for films, but it just wasn't interesting and I lost track of where they were going with the conversation. I could not get my head around the story, it was way too complicated at first and new characters kept popping up. I personally didn't care for Alicia Keyes' character or her counterpart. They felt very separate from everything else that was going on. I was mostly interested in Lazlo Soot, he was mysterious and alone; so intriguing that I had to keep watching.There were parts of the movie that were confusing, but in the way that I didn't understand how they happened. Firstly, Soot shoots the man arresting him after some maneuvering, runs into a bedroom, and about 2 seconds later when the security runs in, he is already out of costume. This is impossible. How could he have run into the room, took the tracksuit off, wig and mask, stuff it under the bed, all in a few seconds? Another thing I found implausible, was when the last surviving Tremor gives his car keys to a man (who is he? I don't know) who then waits about 10 seconds to shoot him in the back about 20 meters away, or even further with a handgun. That is possible, but he would need to be very accurate. But even if I can accept that, he isn't even LOOKING at him! How can he just shoot something he can't see that far away? It makes, no sense. And why wasn't he looking? For dramatic effect? Now I know I'm nitpicking, and this is just a movie, but I found these parts irritating and actually rewound them to re-watch because I couldn't believe it. Now there's gotta be something good to say right? Well, right. While the action was lacking, and not much specific tone to the film, I admit that I was quite entertained in the last 20 minutes of the film. You didn't know who was really dead, what was going to happen to the characters, who was gonna make it out, and Buddy Israel, who's going to kill him? Now, if the whole film had been this way, it would have made for a decent, fun film. However, if only about 20 minutes of the movie were this way, is it worth watching? Well, I say it's harmless, but don't put your life out of the way or anything to watch it, only if you've really got nothing else to do or have watched almost every movie in the world except for this one. Now I'm exaggerating a little here, this movie is probably for a specific audience, and if you like Guy Ritchie films, this is below par, but still kind of in the same direction. Now when i say 'kind of', I really do mean that. People will be disappointed if they want Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and if you haven't seen those yet, make sure you watch them because they're great movies. My final word on Smokin' Aces; it's a slightly mediocre film, perhaps an acquired taste that I can see some loving and more than some not liking it, although I can't see anybody hating it. But watching a kid showing off his karate skills while getting a boner is something you don't see in a lot of films, so, give it a chance, but don't expect too much.",Smokin' Aces
273,tastethevapour,Not Quite Smokin' *SPOILERS*,7,20 January 2007,"I was looking forward to this film since I saw the trailer back in November for a few reasons. One, the cast looked brilliant as it brought in veterans of past gangster movies like Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta and mixed them in with some younger, fresher, hipper faces like Ryan Reynolds and Alicia Keyes. The other was that it looked like it could be a film that could match the likes of Pulp Fiction and Lock, Stock.However that turned out to be the films problem. It was a bit too Tarantino and Guy Ritchie and while the film was pretty original, I couldn't help but think I was watching an American version of Lock, Stock with more guns. Even with all those guns though, there ended up not being a whole lot of action after all even though there is a massive body count.I have a few other complaints that I'll just keep brief - it all seemed to get a bit too serious at the end and didn't seem to suit the tone for the rest of the film. Ben Affleck had far too little a role in it for being billed as the leading man (however his demise came as a shock. The whole thing seemed a bit pointless when the ending came about.Good points however - Ryan Reynolds really surprised me as he turned out to be the real leading man. Having only really seen him in comedy roles before, he was entirely convincing in his role here and cracked no jokes at all. Thumbs up to him. Alicia Keyes was also great for this being her first acting role and looked absolutely incredible. The action (even though there probably wasn't enough for a film of it's kind) was pretty spectacular while it lasted. There are also a lot of scenes with some pretty sharp humour especially with the three Nazis.All in all this is a pretty decent movie, not a classic by any means but worth seeing for sure.",Smokin' Aces
274,tblackwo,Great for what it is,7,26 January 2007,"Don't go in expecting something its not. This is just a great shoot-em-up action flick with pretty good acting, a decent story, and a decent twist at the end. Was impressed with Reynolds, he played the part (suprisingly) well, as well as Common, who had some pretty good dialogue scenes, but you could tell this was his first really big acting role. Ray Liotta is just good in everything he does, and this is no exception.The twist wasn't ground breaking, and the end shoot-out doesn't hold a candle to the True Romance shootout, but was still entertaining.Usually I like Garcia, but not so much here, his accent really bugged the hell out of me. Affleck I usually don't like, but here thought he did well with what he was.But I felt I got my money's worth and thats all I can ask for. You want something that can keep you entertained with action and a decent storyline, check it out, a lot of great build up to a bit of a letdown ending (but still enjoyable) You want a deep script, and Oscar acting, check out something else. Great one to catch with the surround sound and big screen.3.5/5",Smokin' Aces
275,Steyrvolt,Best crime film I've seen in quite awhile.,8,27 January 2007,"Smokin' Aces is the best crime film to be released in a long while, putting even last year's popular remake, The Departed, to shame with its intriguing plot, its dark humour, which is often off-the-wall and occasionally anti-climactic, and its memorable characters. It is not as funny, daring, or iconic as Pulp Fiction was, but the flick is still damned good, and it serves as an amazing start to what should turn out to be a great year for the movies.The plot synopsis is as follows: Buddy Israel, a Las Vegas magician, has a problem. A mob boss has put out a million dollar contract on his life. The FBI has a problem as well. They need to protect Buddy, who just turned snitch on the mob, and that's not going to be easy. A contract that big is going to garner the attention of quite a few bounty hunters.Jeremy Piven gave one of the best performances of his life in this movie. I was glad to see him in such an integral role, as he has often been stuck on the sidelines in the past. Hopefully this film will gain him the notoriety he needs to land some more starring roles. Nestor Carbonell's character should have had a few more scenes as he was the most interesting of the killers and also one of the better actors. The rest of the acting in this film is quite good with the exception of Ben Affleck's abysmal ""performance."" There is also a really annoying child in two scenes of the movie that can't decide if he wants to be a rapper or an easily aroused ninja. I could help him decide really easily if he were to have a third career choice of ""dead."" The camera angles used during the aforementioned child's scenes are ridiculously spastic and feel like they belong in a bad music video for an even worse hair metal band. If the director was going for humour by means of camera-work then he needs to either go back to the storyboards, or possibly just consult Sam Raimi who pulled it off with a gloriously timed pause during the musical montage in Spider-Man 2. Whichever way, I hope that scene is removed in a future director's cut or special edition so that this reviewer can give the film the rating it should have earned, but until then it's getting stuck with an 8 out of 10.",Smokin' Aces

I'm all about movies that are on the top 250, and would rarely see a movie like Smokin' Aces. But, as it happens, I work at the local theatre and don't have to pay for movies, so I figured, ""Why not?"", thinking that if it was terrible, at least I could have a few laughs about it.I went into Smokin' Aces with low expectations and came out extremely impressed! I thought it was an excellent action movie, and only found myself bored once or twice. Some scenes were downright hilarious, and the all-out bloodbaths that occur were exciting and occasionally had me cringing. Contrary to the majority of reviewers, I saw nothing wrong with the ending; in fact, I thought it was great! I agree that you need to be paying attention the entire time or you may miss some key points of the plot. The second time I saw it with a different friend than I had the first time and we missed the first ten minutes, leaving her completely lost through the rest of the film.Overall, if you like action movies - see Smokin' Aces. It's an extremely entertaining flick, with fun characters, a great plot, and tons of laughs as well as action!",Smokin' Aces
277,matrix_vs_badboys,"Smoke it up, quick",7,28 March 2007,"To be honest, it's been a while since i've had so much fun. Unlike others i know, i was anticipating this release for a while. A few months passed and i finally got my hands on it.It was very to close to how i expected it. Thus making it a thrill ride. The story never stopped, the movie kept jumping us from one scene to next keeping us fully emerged the whole time. The camera work was good, kind of seemed a little MCG-ish at times, but nonetheless, good direction and acting.The story Follows Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, who turned from doing card-tricks on stage to Being a high profile gangster to being a High profile Snitch about to blow his mob comrades to Jail. A bounty is Put on him and The most eccentric and hardcore of all killers from all around the world show up to Kill him and claim the huge reward. They end up crossing roads with another and the fun starts. The Story also includes an old fashioned FBI agent and his younger partner assigned to the case and eventually protect Aces.With Jeremy Piven Leading as the self-pittying broken down trickster/Gang member, he plays a convincing and quite unforgettable role. Following him is Chris Pine who made me laugh as he assumed his role as one of the tremor brothers, the loudest and scariest Killers to take on the hit. Also for her big debut, ALicia Keys does a moderate job at portraying the role of a sexy Lesbian Killer. Ryan Renolds also shows us some of his un-van wilder side as he throws at us his acting skills. To be honest, it blew me away how much he could act, never thought he could actually shake that Berg-characters off himself.Downsides are that the movie was not as action packed as i thought it would be, but made up for it with plot and comedic scenes. As someone else already commented, this movie does try hard at achieving something that could've been better if only done right with half the effort. The movie felt as if it had ended too soon. Definitely wouldve been much better if more was added.Intense, Fun, Action-packed, Funny, smart and leaves quite an impression. This is a movie im proud i waited months for to see.",Smokin' Aces

The Action was too short, un-forfilling and in short supply. Also they threw in a Chessy, un-necessary love story, Which sucked and it felt like that the script was re-written just so some of the more demanding, whiney Actors could get there way and have a cute, little, happy ending, while everyone else goes through a living hell or hell.

The overall look of the film is indeed classy, and Reynolds in particular playing his part well. There are some moments that did lead me to question the films point (as you will see, they are totally random), but over all it was an enjoyable film.

However having just seen this turgid marathon of faux-melodrama and tattered plot ribbons I feel compelled to speak my peace. You know the plot: Mob rat needs 'whacking', colourful cast intercedes and fireworks ensue, or at least as much is promised on the outset. The reality is charmless, devoid of any wit or grace and so frustratingly, relentlessly dull that just writing this makes me angry that I didn't walk out before the credits and get a refund on my over-priced ticket. The jaw-clencher is that the set-up is so irresistibly full of promise that it's almost as though two vaguely related films have been tacked together using a child's stitch work. The first hour is jammed full of stylish camera work and set-design with several scenes so hilariously over-the-top that it compensates mildly for the stilted dialogue and irritating characters. Scenes that were promised and focused plot-wise in the trailer. However, further into the film the suspense builds to such a level via the complete lack of action that as the plot slowly plods away from its forgone conclusion you want to scream and bite the furniture. The conclusion is so convoluted and stilted with banal, trite plot-twists that eventually it's a mercy blow when the lights come up. Bizarrely, the only participant who walks away with any real credibility is Ryan Renolds, who is utterly convincing in his role towards the end. And yet the fact that his role even exists is irksome due to its necessity in reaching the insipid final scene. This film really isn't worth your time and especially not your money.

I thought the movie was done very well. A lot of medium and big name actor's in it too. I can definitely for a first time seeing Alicia keys in a movie, she did pretty good herself.

I would also like to say being a huge fan of her music i was eager to see Alicia Keys in action, and i thought her big screen debut was great, she is a brilliant actress and i hope to see her in a lot more.

But his role in the movie was very small, in fact, as title character, I would expect more from him than just snorting coke and sleeping with women. Ray Liotta also gave a good performance, but much like Piven and every other character, there was not much there.The greatest flaw in the movie, is the one character the writers choose to expand on, was really lost in the rest of the story. I found myself wanting to know more about the Tremors, the lesbians, and the one-eyed kid more than the CIA agent.To make matters worse, the concept of the movie spent too much time getting to know characters that wouldn't be around long. Ben Affleck and the ex-cop, the man with the bunny hat, most of the assassins, and Jeremy Piven himself. The effective route would have had Piven more panned out, less of the kid, cut the trio that were shot and dumped in the lake, fill in the story of the assassins, and generally cut down on the scenes.

Ryan Reynolds - okay, yes he's so yummy I'd sop him up with a biscuit, but he can ACT. I've dug him in comedies, I skipped the horror stuff, and now I realized he is SUBTLE.Jeremy Piven - we LOVE it when an actor actually has to DO something (example: play an instrument - for REAL, cook - or look like they do) and wonder ""how much did they already know and did that help them get the part?"". Watching the cards fly through Piven's hands WAS pretty magical. Yeah, everybody thinks he's a prick in real life, but that's the kinda thing that gets you WORK, isn't it?

292,mrbiggmike,One of Joe Carnahan's best movies in my opinion,8,26 July 2019,"Left and right this movie has a lot of good well known actors. The plot is simple.... Various hitmen fight for the prize of One million dollars to Get Buddy Israels heart! Action, some comedy and good score. Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds were awesome. This movie deserves more than the current rating. Kudos Mr Carnahan",Smokin' Aces
293,rosiebenn3,A slightly confusing but overall great film,6,25 June 2012,"This is one of those films I have difficulty explaining how I feel about it. At the beginning I felt the movie went a bit too quick, putting in too much information in our heads to make sense out of. I'm the kind of person who watches movies carefully and make I sure I receive all the information right but I can tell this was too much. For example, them telling us many FBI agents, assassins names and their backgrounds and stories was hard to remember. However, I thought the ending was great. It revealed some of the main areas I was confused about and made sense. The little details were missing but the the main storyline of the film was understood.The actors was great and I'm surprised how this is quite a low tone film that not many people has heard of. This is better than many films I see nowadays. Ryan Reynolds was speculator. I was impressed of his serious acting because he seems to be in a lot of Romantic comedies nowadays. His comedic acting always makes me think of him as a funny guy like Ben Stiller or Steve Carrell but he truly pulled off his serious character well. I was disappointed how Ben Affleck was only in a bit in the beginning as I thought he was the main character to start with, him giving the other men information but then he got killed off? Oh well superb acting from what I saw of him and other actors such as Ray Liotta and Martin Henderson. I wished Affleck played the Henderson's character and appeared in the ending as that would have been better but hey, that's just my personal opinion!I'm a girl but I loved the gore, blood, guns and everything about the film. The gore gave an edge to the film which seemed exciting to me. I liked how they had two female assassins instead of having all boy cast to be the 'baddies' and the girls to be the 'save me victims'! The girls were quite funny to see in the film, which was unusual but it gave the film a dry humorous look without it looking less serious.Overall, I thought the ending was excellent. It was a good storyline that Ryan Reynolds had. It was a great effect when the director of the FBI looked so calm while telling Ryan horrible stuff about the past (I wanted to shoot that motherf**ker) but Ryan Renyolds' character held it well, having a dramatic effect of pulling the plugs (literally) and just sitting there while the was-calm director screaming at the door in slow motion.",Smokin' Aces
294,BretteReid,Smokin' Aces,4,25 January 2007,"I only laughed out loud two, maybe three times total. The highlight of the film was, in my opinion, Jeremy Piven's performance. The whole mob lure only slightly lingered in the background of the plot which, unfortunately, was riddled with holes.The hoods who were brought in as additional hit men were grossly akin to something out of Fight Club or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels; very disappointing. I felt that they were throw-away characters, adding nothing to the film. Nor did Ben Aflecks band of assassins, useless in my opinion. I would much rather have gotten to know some of the remaining characters better, such as Alicia Keys and Jason Bateman's persona's.Andy Garcia's accent came and went throughout the film and for me, it was a major distraction. Ryan Reynold's mellow dramatic end scene was absolutely nauseating as were the questions we were left to ask ourselves. Needless to say, those questions only lasted until the time it took me to get from the theater to my parked car, as it was largely, a forgettable film.Save a couple of bucks, wait and rent it on DVD.",Smokin' Aces
295,dad22js,Brilliant,10,8 July 2007,"Too many reviewers here are really over thinking the whole movie. It seems people want a film to be what 'they' want it to be these days, as if they can't just enjoy what a great piece of work this is. Being 60+ and having seen everything from the silents to all the new CGI stuff I love flicks and know what I'm talking about. ""Smokin' Aces"" is entertaining from start to finish with well acted and staged scenes photographed and edited very smartly. I was watching close enough to see the student/mentor relationship of the FBI partners and the mind set of the Piven character. Try watching this by just sitting back and taking in what's going on and you will have a great time. Your wish that every film will be exactly what you want it to be hampers your ability to be entertained. Kids, expectation is the open door to disappointment. Relax! Enjoy.",Smokin' Aces
296,Fraught,Oceans 11 crossed with Reservoir Dogs,9,15 January 2007,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film.Even though the story on the surface is really simple... i found the over complication regarding the FBI back story was a bit crap, and really could have been dropped. I found myself spending too much time trying to figure out what was going on outside of the main story line to the point of distraction. Especially whenever Andy Garcia was on the screen... not only did i not understand what he was going on about, i also found his accent difficult to understand.The only other moan i have about the film is the Clint Mansell score... it is indeed fantastic... but in some moments (and one crucial moment) the music is almost note for note the same as his score to 'Requiem for a Dream'. No real problem with that, because i love that music... but i just hope Clint wont do this for the rest of his scores! LOL.On the positives... this film is full of fun and interesting characters, played by tons of great actors. Alicia Keys was fantastic in her role, as was Ryan Reynolds. There are also a series of cameos and supporting roles that were fun to watch too... especially Matthew Fox's (Jack from TV's LOST) part.The editing is fun (very Oceans 11) with some good cinematography. The script is fun, but its so desperate to be a Quentin Tarantino wannabe script.The one thing to note here... is this film is violent! Very violent! Not a date movie as i found out! The lady was not impressed! LMAO! As i've said in my summary... this film plays like Oceans 11 crossed with Reservoir Dogs... and if that is your bag, then this is the film for you!",Smokin' Aces
297,omega23,Welcome to the magic show,6,23 January 2007,"Smokin' Aces was most certainly a bit of a magic show within itself, in that while you watched the evident plot go one way, you didn't notice the actual plot until BAM! it came out of nowhere. It wasn't the most coherent of plots sometimes, but for the most part it all wraps up in the end.As far as greatness goes, this won't be up there winning awards. Rather, it might be remembered fondly as ""that cool movie I saw a while ago."" Good drama, good action. Ryan Reynolds breaks out in a truly serious and compelling role.Definitely a movie worth viewing.",Smokin' Aces
298,OBrienman_88,"Sadly, predictable",6,3 February 2007,"Going to see this I was expecting a movie that had the same action and intelligence as The Departed.Sadly, it was predictable and slower paced than advertised, the NY Times review was wayyy off. The action sequences were but a short part of the movie and the twist (not twists) was discoverable within the first 30 minutes to anyone with a sharp ear. The director spent to much time setting up the movie's twist with out delivering a suitable pay off.Still, fun with viewed under the influence of Captain Morgan, with several friends or when paying less than $7.75",Smokin' Aces
299,kmajchro,Pretty dumb - I expected a lot more,4,29 January 2007,"What do you get when you a whole lot of mediocre actors and blend them together with a pretty corny plot? This crappy movie. I have to say that the best parts of the movie included:1. Ben Affleck dying quickly. 2. Jason Bateman's character - the theater actually laughed out loud. 3. When we got to leave.What could have been a decent mob movie turned really corny. If I have to see Ryan Reynolds try to act in yet another movie, I'll be done watching anything with him in it. He's terrible. The first 1/3 of this movie was promising, with the lineup being brought to the stage. From there, it went downhill. Too much violence, a sad attempt at various characters to develop (Pivens, his bodyguard, the 2 women killers, Reynolds strange devotion to his partner - where'd that come from?). And what the hell was with the ninja kid? If this is where action movies are heading, bring back Rambo II. At least it was obvious that it was a stupid action movie, not a sad attempt at something more.",Smokin' Aces
300,stephenson86,What was this film?,5,12 January 2007,"What was this film? I came out of the cinema one hour ago utterly disappointed. The many simultaneous story lines, jumps from comedy to intensity and poor explanation of the main storyline within the film did not work.This film can basically be split down into three obvious areas. The story explanation, the action and the character development moments. I will begin with the story, as soon as the film starts you are in the middle of the story. However the stories explanation is poor, which in turn switches you off to the rest of the film. This problematically makes all the other faults within the film even more visible. The twist at the end however was so poorly explained and unoriginal that the moments suspense that you receive when you hear the twist is stripped away. As for the action, this was great, original and had many different intense styles of attack from each group of hit men, which really impressed me. However this was often short lived and interrupted with the terribly dry character developments, which if I am being honest have no real depth too them.To sum the film up without really butchering it...It tried hard to be something but in the end it fell to pieces by not tying in all aspects of the story together. Not a film that I could watch again, because the plot twists and action never gripped me and never will.On a final note, some of the performances throughout the film were outstanding and its a shame they will be overlooked.",Smokin' Aces
301,usharif,lock stock and snatch American style,10,9 February 2007,"So I went into this movie with low expectations because of the reviews about this movie. Right from the beginning of the movie to the end its a non stop action ride. Very entertaining, the movie has a very simple story line that twists near the end. You will not believe the star cast and the cameos made by various stars in the movie. A lot of fun to watch. The only thing that I was worried about was that the story was too short, characters aren't given enough time to establish themselves because of the movie's fast pace. I would really have liked to see more development of character, definitely would have made this movie nearing to some great ones in the genre. Its not going to win an Oscar or anything but a few years from now it will be remembered. Watch it, I don't get why this one wasn't the box office topper on opening day.",Smokin' Aces
302,exceedthis,Fun shoot em up action.....................,7,31 January 2007,"I heard this movie was ripped by the critics. I think critics, and people, get too worked up over movies. They expect (no matter what kind of movie) to have an awesome script, the best acting ever, and to have some sort of great lesson to learn or something. This movie had none of the above, but it was still a Fun movie to watch. It was a freaking action movie. Basic story, with some good actors, but good acting isn't required in this kind of shoot 'em up movie. It's no thriller, no drama, just an action movie. This is the one genre where movies get more torn apart by people and critics, where it really isn't needed. Granted, some action movies are just plain horrible, but that usually happens when they try to be either too funny, or gear towards trying to be dramatic or having too much of story, or just taking the action sequences way too far and unbelievable (like in Pirates 2). Anyway, if you are looking for a Fun shoot 'em up movie with a some humorous moments than go see this movie.",Smokin' Aces
303,RealCritic78,This movie is a mess,4,29 January 2007,"This movie is a mess. The plot was an OK idea but not near groundbreaking. The style was a joke. It was almost a scary movie type film that mocks other styles. The director came off like an amateur that had no style of his own and cling-ed to and tried too hard to emulate the kill bill, gladiator and fast paced Chinese styles. The movie drifted from the plot and the acting got worse as the film went along due to the directors lack of attention to the important detail. I gave it a 4 and that was generous. This movie will be good for people that don't really think in a movie and just sit there and watch it. If you study or know film at all and you thought this was good...shame on you.D",Smokin' Aces
304,phd-3,"Not the best film, but not the worse, definitely worth it",8,28 January 2007,"I saw the film tonight not expecting much (other than it was going to be fun) - mainly because it actually looked good but I'd been getting too many passes for screenings (one was as late as Thursday - day before it opened!) for this and in *my* past experiences, when they screen a movie this many times - it is bound not to be well received.I'm also a huge Ryan Reynolds fan so I skipped the free screenings and chose to help its box office receipts.It's fast, packed with action, lots of gore (not too much though, but slightly excessive) but it kept you interested until the very end.Yes there were some slightly unresolved characters but if you consider the running time and the amount of characters involved, they accomplished and covered a lot in the film, and it plays out well.All in all, it's a pretty good and definitely a fun one to watch.",Smokin' Aces
305,ianboichat,Could have been so much better.,5,20 January 2007,"This film can't make up its mind, what could have been a decent thriller also wants to be a comedy and as a result fails at both. Some of the violence is just laughable and the attempts to be stylish don't really work any where near as well as other films that have gone before. I've seen some reviews comparing it with Goodfellas but its not in the same league.They did at least try to have some original if unlikely characters. I guess to sum up its not a film I found myself looking at my watch too often but not one I would rush to see once let alone twice.I see the mixed votes and can't believe the number of 10s being awarded, the fact that there was only a dozen people at the Saturday night screening should have given me a clue!",Smokin' Aces
306,mc560,I watched this and i ducked,10,28 January 2007,OK so Smokin' Aces is basically a movie about Buddy 'Aces' Israel a magician/snitch whose time is running out (he is so drugged out most of the time it's almost like your watching Crank) anyway Buddy is such a snitch that a mob boss wants him dead and the mob boss is proving how much he wants Israel dead he is offering a million dollars in bounty to anyone who kills Israel and brings him his heart (not gonna get into that) First off let me say this about the movie if you're an action fan or you love a good story watch this otherwise go watch a piece of crap like epic movie cause this could probably be the best action movie of '07 everything is great from the script (although it lagged in the middle) to the acting (especially Ryan Reynolds he really shows he is a good actor) Secondly try and see this with a crowd that way after the movie you can discuss All i really have to say is this was such a great movie with so much at stake GO SEE IT NOW!!!!,Smokin' Aces
307,donstheman,A great action film,9,13 January 2007,"To summarize Smokin' Aces I would have to use the word excellent.A film with amazing hooks, turns and character interaction scenes. Some people complain that some characters aren't ""serious"" enough, or will pick at another, what they believe to be, fault, when in fact thats the beauty of it.They look at the film and try to analyze far to much, when in fact Smokin' Aces, as the name itself would suggest, is mostly about style like the Kill Bill films and Sin City are, with some characters providing some comedy relief and others more serious aspects, all the while continuing their own personal story which tends to mingle with the others going on about them.Timing is crucial in this movie and it is pulled of superbly, I highly recommend Smokin' Aces, and is sure to be a smash in the box office and eventual DVD release.",Smokin' Aces

Jeremy piven (what a performance) he really looked jacked on coke lol, as for Reynolds and liotta they made a good team of FBI agents i would like to see them in a movie together.. as for the end of this movie was not what i expected what a twist , but even Ryan Reynolds had to shed some tears in this.. i loved watching this movie i watch it everyday Little hear little there.. anyway if you are a fan of ray liotta and Ryan Reynolds(as Hannibal king) than go check this out .. if not your loss..-",Smokin' Aces

It doesn't really succeed, but that doesn't mean it's not balls out entertaining. I mean, the beginning is a little all over the place and the plot is shaky, but seriouslyscrew plot. When these guys start blowing each others heads off plot is the last thing that matters. I literally laughed out loud during the build up to the big climatic battle (the one in which three separate gun fights are about to commence within a casino) due to just how ridiculous these guys have stacked the deckbut ridiculous in a GOOD way! The plot twists are a little ""meh,"" one I predicted in the first half hour and the other one you couldn't predict because you didn't have the information to predict it, but the whole movie is pretty satisfying.

I have spent 1h40 of sheer pleasure, thinking about the numerous friends who would share my pleasure in the watching of this funny and nervous movie. I couldn't stop thinking of the marvelous moment I was spending and that real theater were meant for : spending a crazy and intense moment with those kind of movies. Hélas! my dear friends, hélas! why, after succeeding in taking our breath for more than an hour, after making an entire theater laughing and taking so much pleasure in an simple but efficient plot, full of references (for movie-lovers), couldn't you resist in serving us another of those damned twist-plot at the end of this brilliant entertainment. Why? You had a sheer master piece, couldn't you be a bit less greedy, a bit less ambitious with your audience? It would have been so cool...and so...original. I (and I am not alone for that matter) am so bored with those twist-plot ending. Isn't it enough to give us some pleasure by taking advantage of our sanguinary instincts, and our taste for sadism? Do you really think, that we always also want to be taken for fools with those stupid endings that no you feed us since at least ""Usual suspect"",and so many other movies? I only have one wish, and that is maybe someone would realize that and would cut this part of the movie for a DVD edition. But, I know I am dreaming, for there is another fashion nowadays : always release a so-called ""director's cut"", always a bit longer, and as far as I know, never as good as the former one.",Smokin' Aces
312,theweaklandzoo,Hollywood needs to get a grip...,2,8 February 2007,"Well, this was your typical wannabe action/gang movie that gets too hyped up because there was a fairly decent cast. The plot line was obvious and predictable from the first ten minutes (no I won't say what happened)...and it was entirely too bloodthirsty for me. I think I might have had more interest in the movie if there wasn't so much killing and shooting - but that's a personal preference. The previews and commercials I've seen are pretty accurate ""blam, blam, blam."" Obviously this is not a movie for children, but I would even go so far as to say it isn't a movie for teenagers either. It really irritates me that the movie industry can't come up with better stuff than this - why do people WANT to see a bunch of people shooting each other? What kind of message are we sending our next generation? Good grief, don't we have enough problems without Hollywood glamorizing death and stupidity? OK, I'm off my soapbox. If you choose to see it, just be prepared for a lame story and a bunch of guns.",Smokin' Aces
313,dmray_1,Some really great performances,9,30 April 2007,"I have to say i was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Ray Liota was decent in it, but others really shined.Jeremy Piven was absolutely excellent as Buddy 'Aces' Israel, similarly Ryan Reynolds as Richard Messner was a total surprise. I really appreciated his serious acting, where going into the movie I wasn't sure he could hold his own and not ham it up in his typical comedic style.The movie and plot were overall decent, nothing truly amazing, but on par with other good action flicks. What really impressed me is the characters themselves. As mentioned, there are also other great performances. Thankfully Affleck really wasn't a major part of the movie, and he was the only sour point in my opinion.I'd buy this movie, put in my collection and rank it with Ocean's 11, and The Italian Job.",Smokin' Aces

The camera work was good, which is what I'm sure brought in many unexperienced fans who exonerated the violence and claimed that this film ""kicked ass"". However, true moviegoers know that this does not do the job and that more is needed to make a movie. In fact this movie makes me want to write my own piece of garbage that includes the necessary nudity and violence in order to make a trillion dollars at the box office.

The plot twists are completely predictable and I kept hoping the movie would be over quickly. There really is nothing positive to say about the film other than: ""At least it wasn't 2 hours long."" Some of the dramatic/climactic wind-ups were so long that they completely destroyed the tension or drama of the moment.Don't waste your time watching the film. There is nothing original here and the acting is mediocre at best.

317,Master_Rebellion,"Now, this is what I call superb.",9,19 June 2007,"Smokin' Aces is a truly profound film, and I wish that I had seen it in theaters when it came out. This review won't have any spoilers, because that would defeat the entire purpose of the movie.It was filled with intense action, mystery and suspense... it just doesn't get much better than this. To keep things simple: a mafioso named Buddy Israel has been targeted by a rival syndicate. Several contract killers and bail bondsmen all try to get to him simultaneously. Then, the fun begins.Smokin' Aces is full of twists and turns, but it never fails to satisfy. The beginning starts off a bit slow, with much dialog and the introduction of many characters. You may find it difficult to keep up with what is going on, but once the action begins, you come to realize that you hardly need to remember the characters' names. You remember their faces, who they are, and what they can do.The movie is slightly predictable, but only because of the extraordinary emotions you can feel through the characters and the hardships that follow. Some may find it to be slightly unrealistic as well, but it wasn't as if people were jumping off walls and dodging bullets Matrix-style.This is a must buy movie. Turn off the lights, grab some popcorn, invite some friends over, and get ready for one of the best 100 minutes of your life.",Smokin' Aces
318,Anonaman,"Good idea, Bad execution",3,5 June 2007,"What a mess. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't.The trailers made this movie look awesome. Unfortunately, the movie itself seemed to have been stitched together from trailers of better movies. This is what happens when people make a movie by ""committee"". I can almost hear the questions - ""Should it have a detailed plot like 'The Usual Suspects' or converging plots like 'Snatch'? Stylistic violence like 'Kill Bill' or gory violence like 'Saw'? Be filmed like a movie or a music video?"" Apparently, the committee decided not to choose. Instead, they threw all of these elements into the movie - and more. The result is a confusing mess.There are separate ""plots"" for each group  here is the tally: 2 hit men groups, 2 hit men ""lone wolves"", 1 group of bounty hunters, the FBI, Aces, Aces bodyguard crew, and Hotel Security . These apparently were supposed to be the ""convergent plots"" part of the movie, but none of the characters acts as a unifying guide. As a result, the movie feels rudderless  you just bounce from character to character aimlessly. They also tack on a ""complex"" plot that concerns the Mafioso who ordered the hit. It was supposed to be a gotcha, but you see it coming a mile away. It doesn't even feature speaking characters in real time (only shown in flashback), so your interest is non-existent anyway.There are plot holes big enough to drive a tractor through. For example {Spoiler Warning), early in the movie, 3 hapless bounty hunters are gunned down by the neo-nazi hit men. The ""gun fight"" is maybe 1 second long  literally. A car pulls up, a short burst of gunfire, and all three are on the ground without so much as a twitch. Considering none of the three were hit in the head, it's pretty strange they fell over like they had been given the ""Vulcan neck pinch"". Anyway, these bodies are then dragged to a lake and thrown in. The plot hole? One of the ""bodies"" springs back to life halfway through the movie! Turns out his only wound was to have the fingers of his left hand blown off (shown in gruesome detail). How this incapacitated him enough that the hit men dragged him to a lake without realizing he was alive (and relatively unharmed) is never explained. This is a simple example, don't get me started on the ""transplant"" plot. (End Spoilers) Also, for a modern action movie, the guns are poorly understood props. Most of the actors handle them badly, and the weapons are alternately fiercely overpowered or nerfed. Add to this, stilted dialog, poor scene pacing, bad acting in most cases) and you have a recipe for disaster. On the upside, the movie is pretty most of the time. Bright scenes, lush settings  and many elaborate set pieces. To bad it didn't have a brain to go with the beauty.",Smokin' Aces

The interspersed story lines kept me interested and fed into the imaginative portion of my psyche. The action scenes were absolutely amazing. Since each character was masterfully created the shock of their destruction with a click of the trigger had an even greater impact on the viewer.

I'm very sorry to anyone that has already had the unfortune of watching Smokin' Aces but I also would like to apologize for Alicia Keyes, she promised to be the most interesting character, but for some reason the director stuck to an already dead script.*SPOILER* The only good thing besides Ben Afleck getting capped so early was the trailer.

This movie is so much been there before & got the t shirt a la mode that it becomes overwhelmingly dull. Think of sub-prime Lock Stock, Snatch, Long Good Friday etcWhat keeps the attention is the adrenaline rush of murder after murder, slash after slash. Oh yes, it relies on any number of racial and cultural clichés to help the viewer navigate the plot - a bit like a Punch and Judy show except somewhat less complex Once a movie achieves cult status it becomes difficult for the comments of non adherents to be accepted but in a vain hope here's a bit of free advice to the non converted; please don't waste your time.

So once I've heard about his new project with ""guy-ritchie-wannabe-type-of-plot"" I was really looking forward to seeing it. I'm not saying the movie was completely bad.. it simply was not as good as it could have been. The movie changes both pace and mood several times.. and those differently paced pieces don't fit nicely with each other.

323,dave_mills,Smokin heap!!!,3,5 March 2007,"The film lacked good dialogue and the story felt slapped together and weak, which made me wonder what could attract such a cast to such a piece of cinematic garbage. Of course it has to be the wages because not one of the cast could have surely read that script and said to themselves 'thats amazing, I have to do it'. All the actors tried to make the best of a bad script but failed, you can mold a piece of turd into the statue of David, but it's still a piece of turd. The characters were good alone but together they clash terribly. Each character is more zany and unbelievable than the next and it's almost like a teenage comic book readers rendition of what the criminal world is really like, it should have been animated! If it wasn't for the good technical work (specifically cinematography and editing) and a superb performance from Jeremy Piven as Buddy Israel and new face Chris Pine as Darwin Tremor, I couldn't have sat this film out until the end. Then of course there was the twist which had about as much 'wow' factor as finding loose change in your old jeans.",Smokin' Aces

He should only be cast in comedies and no matter how hard he tried i couldn't take him seriously. Even Alicia Keys was a better actor. The story got sillier as it went on and no matter how hard you try it didn't make any sense. It couldn't really make it's mind up as to being a comedy or a gritty action film. I did like the fast that they killed high profile actors characters early on in the film. The ones you don't expect to die and for a while you think??? He can't be dead,must have kevlar,but no they really are dead and then they kill some more!!!

326,jakegot86d,"why, oh why did i watch the whole thing?",3,7 May 2007,"i was extremely disappointed in this movie. with all the high quality pulp that's been coming out in the last 4 or 5 years it's hard to believe they really screwed this up as badly as they did. not the actors of course. this movies only saving grace is a series of knock out performances from almost every single cast member. Jeremy Piven has long been a personal favorite of mine and he has never let me down. even in a movie like this where he gets limited screen time and only scraps of plot to work with he kills the part like it said something bad about his momma. The only characters i really could've done without where the female assassins. They're prattling jive talk did little if nothing to advance the plot. Speaking of the plot, W.T.F.? They gave away that the head mob guy was the undercover agent way way way to early. I had it pegged the second they showed the f.b.i. guy talking about plastic surgery. The commercial had promised 'plot twists' and the only one i could run down was that Ace's was the mob boss/f.b.i. guys son. That barely counts as a plot twist in my book. I thought the dike assassin was gonna have it out with the rapper and that the cop who got shot was going for Ace's. I gladly would've sat through another 20 minutes of this movie if only for a more satisfactory ending. the alternate ending on the DVD was much better just for the simple reason that it was short and to the point. the ending they went with drags and drags and it's probably only a minute and a half long. for people who like action movies with steven segal and van damme this is right up your alley but for people who like true pulp content and where hoping for the next coming of crime movies go watch grindhouse or rent lock stock and two smoking barrels cause this is garbage.",Smokin' Aces
327,arilius12,Aces Was Smoking,8,31 January 2007,"I thought that Smoking Aces' Was a brilliant feat. Not only was it original and not some cheap assassin movie rip off. I felt that It was wonderfully acted and awesomely directed. Alica Keys debut as an actress couldn't be better, She was strong and yet had been able to play off vulnerability when she was in the scenes with Common. Ryan Renyolds was able to pull off another brilliantly sexy and wonderfully strong character as in the Amittyville Horror. Andy Garcia was as always the strong yet silent type. And Who could forget Chris Pine we got to see him as the Good ol' boy in the Princess Diaries and the unlucky average Joe in Just my luck, But I don't think that We were quite ready to see him as a Redneck Hick Assassin, I thought that Pine's Character in the End was funny when alongside Martin Henderson, the half dead ex-cop. The one thing that Was the best was the fact that Ben Affleks character didn't go and screw up another movie as we saw in the Box-office Flop GILI or whatever the name of that movie was. But most of all was the Performance of a lifetime of Jeremy Piven, I think that he has once and for all proved to the world that he can play the funny as well as the serious, as a man on the edge he stirs up in our hearts that this guy can really act. Piven's performance gave the feeling that he was worth the 10.00 that we paid to see this once and lifetime honest to God good movie.

The only flaw i can even say would be that the twist is a little rushed at the end and may be hard to understand so pay close attention to it and you will be fine. Ryan Reynolds and Jeremy Piven deliver outstanding performances. Jason Batemen was hilarious in his scenes and the rest of the cast did their parts well and only added to the movie.

I found most of the movie pointless and slow.The story is about 7 hit men all trying to kill this guy Aces Israel. All the hit men have their own special trademarks which are pretty cool.This movie had a really awesome storyline which they could have made a whole lot cooler.

But DEFINITELY see it on the big screen!! Three big things, though: 1.) Ryan Reynolds does an excellent job with his big(hopefully temporary) switch to a ""drama"" role. He was great in 2 Guys & A Girl and Waiting, and did an amazing job in this... But do another comedy, dude, we love your funny side!! 2.)

333,Eviceratum,A Culmination of Gunfire and Great Characters...,9,21 February 2008,"Okay the story is this, Buddy Israel is about to snitch on the single most powerful mafioso in the country to the F.B.I. So the mob boss puts out a million dollar hit on him which has to be carried out in 24 or so hours. Naturally this attracts some very vicious heads and so the ultimate showdown of assassins versus the feds at a Sinatra type Lake Tahoe casino/hotel goes down. What do you think? Yeah I said it sounded retarded too, and when I saw the trailer I thought it would be something that would certainly entertain any idiot who gets his movie rocks off watching Rambo flicks where it just goes bang-bang-bang-line-bang-bang-bang. When my friends called me and said, ""Hey we're gonna drink some beers and watch Smokin' Aces"" I drank beer but neglected constantly to give the flick a chance, and when I finally sat down and watched it I was never so happy to be wrong about a movie.I was amazed at how well the story was actually constructed and presented to the viewer, the script was funny and in my opinion inventive, throughout the whole movie it seems like it is speaking from one character moving towards one ultimate objective while it's so many different characters. I also love the immediate introduction of the characters. That's another thing, the characters in this movie alone make it worth watching. I actually think each of the assassins could have their own movies on their own, you can't come out of this movie without a favorite character. My personal favorites were the Tremor brothers, that would be a funny movie. And back to one of the main characters, agent Messner. I had really underestimated Ryan Reynolds abilities as an actor, but like most things involving this movie I was pleasantly surprised. He did a spectacular job of portraying a hero with extreme integrity and intensity, whether he was sharing a scene with Ray Liotta or just standing on his own in a scene it was great to watch him in this film. Also another excellent and surprising performance from Jeremy Piven as the strung out coked out target Buddy Israel, he did a genuinely good job of creating a character you had very few reasons to like (seriously though he did great).Now on the action, I read a comment not too long ago about how there was a lot of gratuitous violence in this movie and that it made it not too good of a movie. I said earlier that's what I thought it was going to be, but in the case of this film it was all plot driven and not every two seconds was like being at a gun range like he'd make it out to be. The real intense fireworks don't even happen until around the end of the movie and before that it is all excellently maintained build up. When the action does kick it is a great combination of cinematography and sound, it's great fun to watch the way it all goes down.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it and still do every time I've watched it after. I suggest it to just about damn near anyone.It's fun, it's thrilling, it's even vaguely thought provoking, and ultimately just good cinema...",Smokin' Aces

335,cetunh,A movie that shoots itself,4,30 January 2007,"First of, for those who don't like Pulp Fiction, I wouldn't advise seeing this move, not because this is a Quentin Tarantino movie, but because it tries to emulate a Quentin Tarantino while managing to fail at that near the middle. For that same reason I would advise those who are fans of Tarantino to not see this as well. For those who don't know who Quentin Tarantino is I am sure you will enjoy it as it starts gearing towards Joe Everyman near the middle, in fact I know you will enjoy it.Second, I will have to say I enjoyed the movie up until a certain point we turn a gritty movie where we see good action movie turn into almost a drama. Almost a single point turned this movie, what the writers did was cram romance into it. Seeing the first half one would ask ""how could you make this a romance?"" well I will tell you, they took one man who couldn't dispatch a guy hoped up on coke and trapped in a bathroom, hand cuffed him and put three crazed assassins after him and he manages to kill two of them, ending what could have been another 30 minutes of bloody shoot outs with the FBI (I can see it now frag grenades and chainsaws) in exchange for him running away with Alicia Keys out the front door (I know, real action packed) after that the film lost it, as if they changed directors and someone else wrote the second part of the film, the assassins didn't shoot their way out, they just walked out unnoticed by the dozens of FBI surrounding the building.The end of the movie is half a surprise, you should know who Sparazza really is from the beginning as there is a lengthy discussion on plastic surgery by a deep under cover FBI agent in the mob, but you don't know why he really put a hit out on Israel, that comes out as a surprise.Over all if you don't care much for directing or writing in your movie, or your a big fan of Baby Geniuses 2, then you will enjoy the movie, I would recommend this to you.

The two black girls...well...what's the story there? The sniper was a lesbian in love with the hot one? So what? I didn't see any food for thought there...The disgusting neonazi trio? Wow, they surely were disgusting...and? The dramatic drunk, stoned, narcotized or whatever target was so...dramatic, drunk and narcotized! What's the story there? He betrayed his buddies...yeah...big deal...Okay, my point is that his moral battle was totally irrelevant because we didn't see anything about his greatness prior to the time of the action. I would understand his dilemma if I could see how loyal and trustworthy this guy was before the FBI bastards broke him. But in the end it was just a mystification! FBI cheated their own people, especially the poor young idealist, who in the act of desperation unplugs the bad guys...come on!

But as we all know, a secret never stays a secret for long. In an attempt to take down Israel and pocket an easy million, seven different men and women make their way to his hideout.The story takes off quickly, introducing over 20 different characters within the first twenty five minutes of the film. This becomes even more confusing when action ensues and the body count grows. Between hit men, mob bosses, and FBI agents, it is difficult to tell which characters should be focused on and who will have a minor role.Major headlining actor for the film, Ben Affleck, disappoints with a very bland performance of a meaningless character that is blatantly shot down within the first half hour of the film.Also headlining is Jason Bateman, who, while incredibly comical in his role, has a total screen time of no more than five minutes.Lack of originality in direction during the action scenes led to incredulous shoot-outs in hotel lobbies and elevators. It's almost as if director Carnahan tried unsuccessfully to emulate Tarantino films of the nineties such as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. While it was a valiant effort, this style of action was overused, which decreased the overall believability of the film.However, while many aspects disappoint, there is always an upside.Actor Ryan Reynolds plays the character of an FBI agent fighting for truth to perfection. Usually seen as a sarcastic character in many comedy films, it was a pleasant surprise to see him breaking out of the mold to try something new.While confusion and disappointment may occur throughout most of the viewing, attention can still be grabbed at times by the witty script and short comedic performances of the minor characters.If your mood calls for a violent and gory flick, Smokin' Aces may be for you.

Even so if you like a good gangster thriller you've got all the right ingredients lots of shoot m ups, blood and bullets and a variety of well known actors in some rather varied roles.

The serious and downbeat ending is at odds to the rest of the film, and the final twist of this tale can be seen a mile off.

Although there do seem to be loads of people after Israel, only about half are what they seem. Which is a cool twist. There are is also some very good acting, from pretty much the whole cast. Ben Affleck, Andy Garcia, Tommy Flanagan (why is the film not in his filmography?)and Alicia Keys to name a few. Check out the mental Nazis; also worth looking out for is the brief role of Matthew Fox (Jack from Lost) his make up is wonderful.

The other thing is that some of the characters feel surplus to requirements and do not really add anything to the plot. As a result, the characters are neither believable or actually likable. This means the plot suffers and character motivation feels highly flawed.***SPOILER**** Smokin' Aces also tries to have too many twists and the twist at the end involving Buddy Israel and Primo feels half baked and forced like the writer felt like he had to come up with one almighty twist or else.The films feels like one giant slickly shot TV commercial for a car or something. It's trying too hard to be cool, likable, smart, funny and edgey but in doing so ends up feeling really contrived.The film is still none-the-less watchable as a throwaway piece of action but at the end of the day, I don't think it has staying power or longevity and I'm not sure if anyone will really remember it 10 years down the line.",Smokin' Aces

IMHO, the true revelation here is Alicia Keys. The camera loves every angle of her being in this supporting role, and if her choices in the medium of cinema are as careful and discriminating as those made in pursuit of her musical career, she is destined to achieve a level of screen prominence that has eluded her female peers and forerunners since the 1980s.",Smokin' Aces

The vast array of bullets flying throughout the film helped to keep me interested when I didn't get my fill of Jeremy Piven's wit and verbal assault I had grown accustomed to from Entourage. But i was truly glad to see very little of Ben Affleck in fear that it would be another Gigli crapper. Allstar cast(excluding Affleck) kept the interest but eventually became a hindrance b/c the twists that you hoped for weren't realized just b/c of that.

The filmmakers set the stage for what could have been one heck of a shoot-out. Instead, it settles for a ""twist"" ending that REALLY disappoints. Many characters sub-plots are left unresolved. It's one thing to have a consistently bad movie, but having a movie that could have been great and blowing the ending is even worse. I couldn't believe Joe Carnahan (NARC) directed this picture.

Instead I got a fast paced snatch wannabe that actually kept me on the edge of my seat until the ending when it tried desperately to make itself far more complex than it actually was. It seems that every modern movie wants to gain the great twist award and so they shoot themselves in the foot trying to do it, this was the case with Smokin Aces, a decent action flick that tried to take on intellectual status towards the end. There is one actor that has to be mentioned though and that was Jeremy Piven, since i first saw him in say anything I've loved Jeremy Piven and he showed me a completely different side of his acting in this film and the entourage star actually was able to provoke emotion through a very genuine performance.",Smokin' Aces

This is it. It's over the top with scenes made especially gruesome when the point could have been made quite simpler.For example, when introducing on the hit men, trying to make the point that this guy is REALLY bad, they show a naked guy strung upside down by his feet having his genitals blow-torched. I couldn't figure out why they needed to do that. It was over the top. I almost stopped watching at that point. You expect this from the teenage ""Halloween"" type movies, but not in what was supposed to be a major release from a major label.But, you put all that on top of the fact that the movie has no story, no character development and very confusing dialog. Despite having no story we're thrown a major twist at the end.How major stars like Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia could agree to be in this is surprising. These guys are quality actors and they are sleepwalking through the whole thing (especially Garcia who tries to put on a Texan accent, again WHY???)

The trailer to this movie disclosed to the potential viewer precisely what he was in for, and to that extent it completely lived up to its billing. Any movie which incorporates into its soundtrack Motorhead, John Cale, and The Stooges is fine by me. The chronic gripers should stick to Hamlet or something. That's all I intended to say, but it's too short for submission, so I'll continue to berate the chronically unfulfilled. Sure, Narc was a better movie in that it was more realistic, but Aces was clearly intended as a comic book brought to life, not a navel-gazing or thought-provoking exercise, and for that I'm grateful to Carnahan.

359,carin_in_mtl,deserves some credit.,9,29 January 2007,"Let me say first, that my favorite film of all time is ""True Romance"". I have scarcely seen another movie which has compared at all to it, within the genre of action. ""Smokin' Aces"" comes on pretty strong though, and for those of you who can handle the violence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Kill Bill"", and love a great plot with fun twists and turns, it is most definitely worth seeing.Jeremy Piven, ""It"" guy of the moment is terrific as Buddy Israel a washed up lounge act, with a penchant for women, cocaine and walking the thin blue line. Piven has a depth of character that shines in all of his somewhat subtle performances. He is never over the top, but he delivers.Ryan Reynolds, well, Ryan Reynolds is so pretty that I could not hate him if I tried. Happily, I think his acting is credible and spirited, and despite some of his novice skills, he does a good job as a determined FBI agent.The rest of the cast is, well, perfectly cast. Ben Affleck plays the kind of role that he should ALWAYS play, the brother hatchet team are beyond entertaining, and even Alicia Keys, in her film debut works it out in her role as a Hitgirl wit ha heart.The action is ferocious, the violence graphic and the script, for the most part, sharp as a knife.

Is it a shoot em up, a comedy, a drama, a series of criminal events with a twist; it never could maintain a theme. Additionally there were too many characters and subplots. For all they had going on, you need a slower better paced movie, but this one was trying to be flashy and stylish too. There were a lot of interesting characters, but we never got to know them that well. Jeremy Piven's seemed like it could have been good with a little humor added they never took him that way. Overall, lots of good pieces, lots of interesting characters, lots of potential, but this movie tried to be a little bit of everything and ended up not being much of anything.",Smokin' Aces
362,bittersweetdreams,Thoughts on 'Aces',10,10 February 2007,"First off, I think this movie was released at a miserable time for movies. January is typically ""slums month"" for film releases so the really great ones are overlooked. And, if they aren't surrounded by idiotic crap they're dismissed by Oscar re-releases. Secondly, I adore a great ensemble movie that doesn't sacrifice plot or performance for CGI and gimmicks. I don't think I've given any spoilers, but I have gotten in depth on the characters so if you want to see this film, perhaps you should not read these comments until afterward.Smokin' Aces is a very entertaining movie, no it isn't an epic and it isn't impossibly weighty, but at its core it is a morality tale about balance and the preservation of ideals. Writer/director Joe Carnahan (Narc) delivers a thrilling, clever tale as seen through the eyes of multiple colorful, complex characters. The previews really don't give mention of how truly clever this flick is or lend credit to its diverse and deeply talented ensemble.Admittedly, I only went to see this because I'm a big fan of Ryan Reynolds. Ultimately, and deservedly so, he is our hero of the film and the moral compass caught up in a whirlwind of secrecy and kinetic energy. He doesn't have chance to administer his usual dose of hip cynicism and smarmy retorts, no, he really seems to stick to the idea of who his character is: an FBI agent sent to recover a mob witness known as Buddy ""Aces"" Israel.Joining Reynolds' in this pursuit is his amiable mentor, Ray Liotta, who was charming in a true under spoken good guy role. He has a great way of delivering dialog and lots of it, so to see him in this film (reteamed with Carnahan) was a delight and also interesting because we know there are going to be plot twists and mystery ""hitters"". With his film reputation behind him, it's never clear if we're going to get good Ray Liotta or maniac Ray Liotta.Advising them, the deputy director of the FBI, as portrayed by Andy Garcia, a once and former force of intensity himself. The trio of actors made sense as the guys who would be involved in this pursuit. Garcia has the lofty qualities of omnipotent conduct and the suave grace to also add some mystery to an otherwise throwaway role.The best performance, in terms of range, is given to us in the form of Buddy Israel, masterfully fleshed out by Jeremy Piven. This man seriously delivers! Anguish, torment, grief, despair and that seedy A-hole quality he's so good at playing. No, he never makes it easy for us to wish him well or ill. A Vegas illusionist and card shark living a life of depravity and gratuity, he is both comical and tragic when the plot requires.Aces' right hand man is an actor I had never heard of before, a gentleman who calls himself Common. As Aces' Sir Ivy, he is foreboding yet at the same time incredibly impeccable and distinguished. His scenes with the equally scorching Alicia Keys, as a contract killer, are an excellent subplot. Speaking of Alicia Keys, she breaks the mold for singers becoming actresses. She really becomes her character and holds her own as the lead female in a testosterone flood. Backing her up as ""momma"" to her ""baby girl"" is her partner in crime Taraji Henson, who was so good in Hustle & Flow.Henson is one of many second tier characters gunning for Aces. So many great, quirky performances were chocked into this film. Actors like Martin Henderson and Chris Pine create a very graphic subplot, while Matthew Fox, (a really creepy) Jason Bateman, Peter Berg, Tommy Flanagan and a surprisingly low key and cool  yes, cool  Ben Affleck turn in minor roles making this even more enjoyable. Also, to elevate my movie geekdom status, it was a thrill to see Vladimir Kulich in another film. He was the Viking King who led Antonio Banderas in The 13th Warrior.Great action/character movie, great look, loads of fun and whatever you do  DO NOT!!  take your eyes off Ryan Reynolds. The evolution of his character is the foundation of the tale and the mystery of why Buddy Aces is such a value to so many!",Smokin' Aces

Sure there is shooting, cursing, hookers and mafia, but it's all served in a vomit-inducing way. First - too much graphic violence. Chainsaw ? Machete ? Electric current on the testicles ? Fingertip munching ? WTH, producers ? Lack of balance and good taste - or trying to cash-in on violence in order to please mainstream idiots - either way you guys are guilty. Nothing more to say. U trying to shock the audiences ? FAILED. I wanna be shocked - I can look around and see whats going on in the world if I feel like it. Second - this movie is wannabe Snatch - It has no style, no humor, no characters that make us care. Introducing new characters as the film goes on with a freeze-frame shot and the name didn't work here - felt forced and lacked style.Third - actors. On their own - talented. Here - I can think of only one conclusion - bad casting. Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds ? Bad mix. Ben Affleck - getting killed of early on - kudos for showing us that Mr. Affleck can get a role where he is not the center of the universe, nice to know. As to Mr. Reynolds - well, he certainly tried to deliver. But honestly he should stick to comedy. He will ALWAYS be the guy that fed jizz-buns to some poor schmucks.Sorry, tough luck. Seriously sir, DO NOT ATTEMPT to take on roles in dramas, crime flicks or sci-fi (blade) because you work good in comedy. Accept it - temet nosce. I could go on - karate kid fiasco, characters that are neither likable nor real bad guys, ho ho ho jokes in overabundance, showing women in a totally degrading way, FBI that is as trustworthy as a pawn shop owner with golden tooth, UTTER IDIOTISMS like shooting with a handgun at a hotel across the street trying to take out a sniper... The best part of this movie is definitely the title character - Buddy ""Aces"" Israel. Jeremy Piven is worth watching here. Good lines, good tempo, good charisma and BELIEVABLE acting. Seriously Mr. Piven - I hope to see you in roles that are worthy of your talent. You have style sir, I applaud you. Now all you need to do is find projects that are tailor-made for you, because even though you did decent in this film, you shouldn't have participated in this project.Final verdict - worth watching if you get it on cable or on a flight.

The plot may be a little predictable and used, but it's forgivable. THAT is where it's shortcomings stop. The Acting is phenomenal (with the exception perhaps of Andy Garcia, who was supposed to be channeling a southern accent, but was miserably inconsistent); special nods should be made to both Alicia Keys and Common for some talented performances--and Reynolds is yet again wholly believable and surprising.

It was like a monochromatic display of gobblety gook---too much cinema greatness wanting to happen, without it ever materializing. Why does Ben Affleck have top credit? Should not his role have been mentioned as a cameo, also named Narrator #3? And why was Alicia Keys character so ghetto? Is that what Hollywood really thinks of Black women? Man, if so, I'd hate to be Black--those 2 broads were really yuck. But I'm not saying that to disparage on their acting abilities, only to say that when the writer created the characters for this film he used EVERY stereo-type to bring them all to life. How 'bout those Hillbillies? Is YUCK accurate or what? (Well actually the tall one had a nice body) Each character was as unoriginal as the next. To mention plot is hard, because the film has/had a good premise only this Joe Carnahan guy didn't know how to put it together. Then again after reading his bio and learning of his origins I see why he thinks this movie is good, though I did like Narc. But I must say this movie would have been 100000000000% better if it had been made by British or Chinese filmmakers, they seem to be able to make slick movies with many characters and multiple simultaneous sequences.

371,ChrisSucks,Disappointing but sporadically entertaining,6,3 February 2007,"How do you mess up a movie that has a full house of colorful characters, Jeremy Piven, and great action sequences? Ask Joe Carnahan. Whether it's poor marketing or weak writing, ""Smokin' Aces"" falls flat as a action film that gets bogged down by it's emotional elements. On the outside, it looks hip and cool - considering it's art direction, cinematography, and its in your face action cinema aspect. On the inside, it's boring and overall weak. The action sequences, while imaginative and highly engrossing, are too sporadic. Instead of a large final showdown (which is what this film truly needed) Carnahan releases his action in doses, which is a pure shame. Carnahan spends too much on emotional elements (usually involving Buddy Israel's downward spiral) and doesn't spend enough time on action. To be fair, and to repeat myself, when the action does actually happen, it is pretty entertaining. ""Smokin'"" is truly disgraced by it's own acting. Common, as Buddy Israel's bodyguard, is somewhat excused for his underacting, but Reynolds is not for his overacting - you would think he would eventually learn how to portray frustration and sadness without going completely over the top. Jeremy Piven as Buddy Israel is great, it seemed like a natural role for Piven that he portrayed without much difficulty. (And for the record, Alicia Keys, who hasn't done much acting before, wasn't too bad). My major gripe comes from how bored I was. This film had so much potential to be a super ""Crank"". If Carnahan had delivered a mindless hour and a half shoot-em'-up mêlée I would be in line to see it a third time. This is not the case.

Not one character has you feeling anything for them. Each personality about as shallow as a puddle. The acting is OK, the film having its fair share of Hollywood in there (Garcia, Liotta et al.) but the characters they've been given are about as hollow and cliché as they come. There seems to be no sense of direction and the worst of it all is that you've already figured out most what is going on by about half way through the film.There are so many points in this film that don't make sense. The biggest eyebrow raiser is the part where Alicia Keys' character is in a lift and is being watched over by her pseudo-lesbian partner in crime. When I say watched over, I literally mean watched from afar by a sniper rifle in the next building. When all hell breaks loose and the sniper begins shooting, we clearly see a FBI Agent in the background retaliating by firing his shotgun in the vague direction of the snipers position. I didn't need rigorous FBI training to tell me that a shotgun doesn't quite have the range or stopping power of a sniper rifle and I wouldn't attempt to shoot haphazardly toward an unknown snipers position with one either.The most annoying thing at all is that none of the so called Hit men/women actually act like one would. I'm pretty sure a hired gun would not go in all guns blazing and would be able to take out a target without causing so much mayhem.The only saving grace for this film is Jason Bateman.

Seriously, if anyone saw guys like that walking on the street they should have called the cops. But no, these guys can walk into a expensive hotel like that and get in an elevator without being noticed. somehow being able to bring some weapons including a CHAINSAW !!!-Then there's the stupid karate kid.... my god what the hell did he have to do with all of this and why was he such a moron.. seriously.. his part had absolutely nothing to add to the movie !! it was unrealistic and therefor not even funny. A kid , how crazy it might be would never respond to a wounded person lying at his front door steps like that ! if this was meant to be a joke, then it was a bad one !I could go on and on about this film, it's really bad and seriously not worth renting.

382,fao_66,The idea was good...,6,9 February 2007,"Surely the story of the movie lends itself very well to make a movie that is one big thrill ride. That was what I was expecting when I went to see it, but somehow the movie didn't quite turn out the way I hoped it would.What the movie does is play on safe a lot. You got your standard compassion moment, firefights with a small twist and hit men who all have a specialty, good looking female killers etc etc. Oh and Mr Goodguy of course. The characters are introduced in a basic way, and *big spoiler* none of the main characters (except the target) die so the sequel can be made as a cash in no brainer. (just switch buddy for some other dude)The acting wasn't of a high standard but it wasn't irritatingly bad either. Luckily there are a lot of things happening at the same time in smokin aces, so if you're bored with a particular scene you can be relieved by the fact that it will end in a couple of secs. Two things in this movie are of a ""classic"" standard, namely: *Buddy ""Aces"" Israel is a well written and splendid acted character (first time I really noticed Jeremy Piven in a movie) *The cut up scene where Sir Ivy (the rapper Common) confronts Buddy Aces.

383,sidyre,Stupid Fun,6,1 February 2007,"I don't think I've seen a movie as senselessly violent in my life. More or less everybody gets shot and most of them die. This movie would be great if it stuck to what it's good at: snappy one liners and casual murder for no good reason. Alas, this ridiculously over-the-top movie tries, most awkwardly, to be something it never had a chance of becoming: serious.One or two moments of sappy drama really destroy the continuity of the movie. And at the end, they throw in this crazy twist which, besides being utterly preposterous, is not at all germane to story. For it's all it's bumbling effort to be something more than a bunch of shallow characters shooting at each other, this movie ends up being less.When the movie resigns itself to being stupid, it is entertaining.

Maybe it was lost in the screen writing. There are a half dozen memorable, interesting characters in a day where you are lucky to find one or two in an average movie. There is a period of about 40 minutes in the middle of the movie where I was extremely interested in what was going to happen next, impressed by the wit and the style of the movie, and into each of the characters. Unfortunately, that is followed by a let-down of a conclusion and a long, dragging explanation scene that is supposed to be the ""Usual Suspects"" plot-twist. Unfortunately, the viewer hasn't been made to care about the character involved in the twist and the rationale for the swerve is barely comprehensible. If the best you can do to tie up the gaping holes you've left in your plot is to have a minor character enter stage left to explain it to one of the major characters in a five minute scene of dialog and flashback, then you need to go back to the drawing board with your screenplay.",Smokin' Aces

386,ianridd2,A movie you want to like... but just can NOT!,3,25 June 2007,"This movie should get high marks for its style, but everything about its style that is likable, was ripped off from Guy Ritchie. The plot is sooo out there, that I can only imagine that the writer, director... producers and pretty much every studio exec was doing more blow than the characters in the film. I got the distinct feeling that the ending was done in re-shoots. There are only two main characters in the entire ending. And the ending is basically Andy Garcia reading you the reveal, as one gigantic paragraph. Something tells me this was not the original ending.At its best, the movie is a psychedelic, post-modernist romp through the crime genre. All the usual wash-outs and degenerates from the Mickey Spillane novels are here, but they have a 21st century spin to them. High high marks for Jason Bateman. His cameo appearance is almost worth the price of admission. The violent scenes are pretty much the best part of the film, and some of them are genuinely tense. But they are filled with glaring holes. Time and again, cops and security guards fail to follow basic precautions and wind up getting killed for it. Alicia Keys and Ryan Reynolds are miscast. Andy Garcia! Holy cow, what does he call that accent? Southern/Boston.Most of the pivotal events of the film are based around happenstance and freak luck. Without getting into the details, the ending is unbelievably hack and unimaginative. Put it this way, the emotional core of the story is based around a character that we never meet, except in flashbacks. And the inciting incident of the film (the hit being put on Israel) appears to have been a giant misunderstanding. (the guy said they wanted ""Israel's heart"". They construed that to mean they wanted him dead. But who put the million dollars in a swiss bank account and told every hit man in the Western Hemisphere that they could have it for killing him? Makes no sense) What a rip off!!High Points: 1) Jason Bateman (is AMAZING, in fact I swear that when he is slapping high-fives in the hotel room, Ben Affleck is struggling to keep a straight face.) 2) The Neo-Nazi characters (even though it felt as though they had been lifted from Big Lebowski and The Road Warrior). Their malevolence is so gleeful that it's contagious. 3) Jeremy Piven's coked-out, paranoid Israel. If there is a shred of human emotional core to this film, this is it. He nails the character, both megalomaniacal and insecure. As his situation becomes increasingly desperate, he sinks further and further into self-delusion. The camera trains on his eyes and Piven somehow builds a universe of frailty inside. It's wonderful.Low Points: 1) Andy Freakin' Garcia (yeesh!). Speaking of a universe of self-delusion. Watching an actor slip in and out of an accent is like listening to a guitarist play out-of-tune. But it is clear that Andy Garcia is utterly convinced of his own prowess. Sad. 2) Guy Ritchie rip-offs everywhere 3) Movie begins and ends with tons of back story given in paragraph form. Always a bad sign. 4) The sense of time is extremely distorted (I swear the skinheads were riding the elevator up to the penthouse for twenty minutes) 5) The cops and security guards in this movie are only one step above Keystone Cops. Bumbling idiots who fall for the flimsiest deceits. 6) There are at least five characters who take a ton of bullets, and somehow live through it. And when I say a ton of bullets, I'm talk ten to twenty at point blank range. One is difficult to believe, but it happens over and over again. 7) Everything about Alicia Keys' exit from the building is contrived and impossible to believe. 8) The writer and director seem to treat story like style and style like story. The story behind this movie is confusing at best and ridiculous and contrived at worst and serves only as a silly excuse to get Nazis and Lesbians and coke-heads and cross-dressers together for an orgy of violence and cool dialog.",Smokin' Aces

It started out with a very cool idea but the arc was anti climatic and the gratuitous violence was really a mess. Ryan Reynolds rocks as does Jeremy Piven. I agree with others, we could have seen more Jeremy maybe even a jeremy v. Ryan faceoff. That would have been cool. Ray Liotta is always great, but mis-cast here. Was Ben A. just dying to be in a mob flick? Very impressed with Alicia Keys and Taraji Henson. Alicia has that sultry look for movies.

I searched for a thread of genuine storytelling in this movie and found nothing but confusion and gratuitous visual indulgence. I couldn't have sympathized with the characters even if they hadn't mostly been killed off. Let's hope the filmmaker got it out of his system so he can make something appreciable next time. And did anyone get anything satisfying or logical out of the undercover cop back story? I thought the best performance was Ben Affleck's posthumous speech from the pavement.",Smokin' Aces

Forget what the critics are saying (2 out of 5 stars) the diverse cast and Snatch like story line take the audience for a ride. Ryan Reynolds does not disappoint as he finally comes out of his comedy shell and provides a worthy performance as a serious character. The rest of the cast is star studded with some not so big name actors and actresses filling in quite well (Common, Alicia Keyes, Martin Henderson). I gave this movie 10 stars because the twisty plot keeps the audience thinking and the action is not thrown at you all movie but rather in small doses that give it that extra kick you were expecting.

Then you'll start to find yourself starting to care about characters, getting tense when you see one of the mercs on screen and laughing your ass off whenever you see another.

And then, like watching something die and not being able to do anything about it, I saw the story line dissolve. Action to action to action to absolute crap. How? The last plot turn was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. It was THE worst ending I have ever seen. It also was, without a doubt, a shock to the cerebrum in that the pure duality of the movie's greatness brings you down with it. The action is amazing and the acting is surprisingly amazing.

392,guyfish,Terrible,2,12 January 2007,"This film is TERRIBLE, but its almost worth seeing.Allow me to break it down...We are introduced to around 20 characters, in the first 5 minutes; by each character having a still shot of them with their name and occupation subtitled. In my opinion this is such a no-no for a film, as it means that the audience cannot properly connect with the characters and learn about them. Another problem that is immediately obvious is the amount of characters, once again impossible to connect with them.The film from this point is a downward spiral, with poor acting from all, including Ray Liotta and of course including Alicia Keyes, but worst of all being Ryan Reynolds. Cinematography is also poor with little innovative shots, sticking only to basics. However a birds eye shot (of the main character, Buddy ""Aces"" Israel) makes an appearance, for no reason whatsoever. What really shines through as being the worst part of all is the script, coupled with the direction. One particular scene sees around 20 armed officers waiting outside of a lift ready to fire, then suddenly three crazed men DANCE out of the lift with guns, chainsaws and so on, without being shot at once mind you... This part simply looked like a CIRCUS, it was a joke - you have to see it to believe it.The ending on the other hand is what made me give this film 2 stars instead of 1. From the outside it looks like a really, really poor ending... Possibly the worst you have ever seen! However, as Ryan Reynolds pulls those life support plugs from the walls I think that director, Joe Carnahan, was telling the audience that he was pulling the plug on the film.Quote of the film: Ryan Reynolds: (Angrily) Talk to me like a man!",Smokin' Aces

I thought that the *twist* at the end was pretty obvious to see, but either I have seen too many twist movies or it was that obvious. The music score that was accompanied with the movie was quite interesting and the ending scene was quite a nice way to finish it off.If you want to see a movie that is a lot different from what you see now a days then this will be a movie that you will want to check out.

This has one of those ""buddy casts"" like ""Ocean's Eleven"" and others where a bunch of actors get their friends cast and then the descriptions of who's who with captions and voice over's from other characters a la Ocean's 11 style and many others we've seen.Like another viewer posted, Jason Bateman is stellar. I didn't even recognize him until a few minutes into his crazed diatribe. That's always a good sign that an actor is doing a good job.Thankfully, somebody else noticed Andy Garcia's pitiful excuse for an accent. Where are you from? Brooklyn? Mississippi? Maine? Georgia? Halifax? Come on! Can't he afford a voice coach, or why not do it in his own voice. Where he was from didn't do anything to flesh out his one-dimensional character, so why not just leave it?! Reynolds did an alright job; Alicia Keys was cool, but her partner was much better as the insecure lesbian-in-love-with-her-beautiful-probably-straight partner. Tormented, but the characterization definitely seemed familiar.The torturer guy (another Lost star) was pretty good, but come on (!): DIE ALREADY! The worst part was the end. With all of those people around Israel and the other mafia dude in the hospital: the Swede, Garcia, security, nurses, etc. how was it that Messner could just waltz in, shut the door and sit down in a totally glass room and nobody notice??? Whack, I say and a bummer of a denouement to what someone else said was a storyline that could have been much less convoluted and still have been satisfying.

I thought that it was great camera work and the plot of the story was original as well as captivating. Go see this movie. I went to the screening and I'm glad that i waited the 45min outside in the 25 degree weather and then another hour inside the movie theater with a bunch of loud people next to me. Trust me...its worth your money and your time. One word of advice though. This movie is not for people with attention problems. You miss one second of this movie or even a word you might miss the whole object of the movie so just be careful. Jeremy Piven (Buddy 'Aces' Israel) was dramatic as well as freaking hilarious. Ryan Reynolds (Agent Richard Messner) was also a strong dual character. His comedic presence as well as his strong dramatic performance was enough to make this movie a hit in theaters. The rest of the cast are well known actors who each play there own essential role in the movie and make it that much better. I hope you like the movie and my review.

I'll try to put it a little more succinctly; good actors like Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta, and Andy Garcia had no hope of rescuing this film. After setting up some moderately interesting characters and what seemed a promising story line, the film quickly devolves into a muddled composition of shooting, screaming, and truly senseless violence. The characters quickly became moronic clichés, while the plot, losing all direction and seeming unable to find a natural resolution, sputtered and died. The last half hour of the film was close to unbearable, and my urge to applaud the long-awaited and ever-so-merciful ending was tempered when I reminded myself that I actually blew eight American dollars on this swill. I'd have been better served to save those eight dollars next to my toilet in case I ever found myself out of toilet paper. My real regret is that so many decent actors and actresses will forever have their names attached to what is, in effect, a movie highlighting everything wrong with Hollywood. My only advice is if you do decide to go see this film, bring a loaded gun with you...you may very well wish to blow your brains out before it's over.",Smokin' Aces

The plot revolves around Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, a Las Vegas magician who gets himself in trouble with the Mob. A 1 million bounty is put on his head and 7 hit men come after him to collect the bounty. Jeremy Piven (Israel) does a great job and shows how great he really is.

Take your favorite Tarantino movie, take out some of the humor and smartness, then push the limits of absurdity even further.The writing could've been better in this movie. A lot of the humor falls flat in my opinion, although the movie does have a few funny points. The storyline had some implausible points that can be forgiven in the greater context of the movie.The characterization of all the different personalities, although never delving much deeper than mere caricatures, was one of the strengths of this movie and lends the movie what humor it has. The viewer is left wishing to know more of each character's story.In general, the movie was overacted. Ironically, this wasn't a bad thing as the overacting actually plays into each character's cartoonish depiction. Ryan Reynolds is mediocre as the leading man, but had the dubious role of trying to fulfill the director's mistaken attempts to add drama to the movie, the writer's often witless attempts at humorous dialogue, and a self-defeating idea that any character could be taken seriously in this movie. Piven does fine as Buddy Israel, the Vegas showmen, but ultimately his character lacked the depth necessary for the audience to care what happened to him. In the end, Smokin' Aces will not leave its viewers pondering any deep thoughts, but succeeds as an overcaffeinated, ADD-inflicted 14 year-old's wet dream with guns blazing, machetes hacking, and enough crazy spirit to leave most moviegoers with a smile on their face.",Smokin' Aces

No, it's not quite as good as Narc- but it is a very different film. There are so many twists and turns, along with brilliant camera shots, and fantastic balance between action/comedy/and drama.Two notable performances include Jeremy Piven and Ryan Reynolds.

He is one of the best up and coming actors in Hollywood, and him as a cracked out magician is not much of a stretch for this multifaceted entertainer.Not to mention the beautiful and deadly Alicia Keys who turned in an outstanding performance as eye candy that could whoop some butt.

Im not a person who goes to watch a film for its action, but an hour in the film i just wanted some sort of entertainment at least! And people kept dying... then coming back to life! That happened too many timesThe dialogue is appalling! The writer has clearly watched a few gangster movies and a couple of sopranos (best series ever) and thinks he can write a mafia movie! well he cant! Its very annoying! OK, so the story. well in the first 10 minutes you learn that there is a man and everyone wants to either save or kill him. Then.... nothing, until the very last 5 minutes. I mean what the hell happened in the middle! it wasn't story, or action, or entertainment! it was just a build up to nothing (or at most some very dull, unimpressive scenes) !So the acting. ray liotta seriously needs a good script! he is really putting himself down with these movies. Affleck was good, as always, but once again he needs a decent script behind him. The good thing about this film (there are 2) is that ryan reynolds is doing something a little different to his normal gig. And he managed to do something i didn't expect at all, he impressed me. He proved that he has potential to be a good actor. The other good thing was a cameo from mathew ""jack from lost"" fox. Which i enjoyedAnyway, i don't want to end this review on a positive note, as i don't want to encourage people to see it at all. This is a boring, pointless, poorly written movie with no story or emotion that will leave you angry that you had wasted your time watching it",Smokin' Aces

410,e_v_i_l-1,"Top flick, dons't fail to deliver!",9,18 January 2007,"After seeing the trailer numerous times, my reaction was always ""Definately watching THAT movie!"" I wasn't disappointed. Many people have compared it to Tarantinos work, but I think this is slightly insulting. Tarantinos work, compared to this, is a clunky awkward mass of banal and pompous scenes.Smokin' Aces is slick, like the head of bald man, polished and rubbed down with baby oil. The main characters, both assassins and FBI agents, are both engaging and easy to understand. No convoluted reasons for involvement; they want the money, pure and simple.Starts out with a nice bit of plot establishment from a few of the characters perspectives and begins to get them in on the hit. The next section of the movie see the FBI slowly figuring out just how many people are interested whilst watching the assassins plots to get to Buddy unfold (And in some cases unravel!) The fighting is stylish, a fantastic balance of violence, one-liners, realism and just enough Gun-Fu to satisfy even the most jaded critique of movie gun-play.The plot towards the end re-establishes itself and begins to resolve itself as a few predictable and a good few not-so-predictable plot twists occur.The end, whilst some people have said is an anti-climax, fits perfectly and works well, wrapping up the plots and characters stories.Not really open for a sequel, but it would be possible. Personally I'm hoping they do, or maybe even a prequel for some of the characters.",Smokin' Aces
411,monkeytycoon,Smokin Ace's is The movie of 2007,9,31 January 2007,"I don't understand, Why do people bash this movie? anyone who thought it was ""Horrible"" is insane. This movie IMO is Far from horrible i myself easily would give it a 9.5/10, i really don't see what the problem is here the movie stands and deliver in all aspects (Loved the humor just as much as the action) How about for just one second we sit down and think about the movie ""Smokin'Ace's"" instead of starting with all the bad thing's let's start with all the good aspects of the movie.Action- Being a action oriented movie it is bound to have lots of action, True as this may be i have seen many more action movies that had a lot MORE action (Hence the word MORE people, More doesn't mean it is better)then Smokin Ace's but the fact of the matter is the action in Smokin Ace's is Stylish. Smokin ace's combines that of Style and Personality, These element's alone make the action fun and thrilling to watch. Each action scene is much different from the last for instance the ""Brothers"" fight is much more ""Steadfast"" and ""Agressive"" then the sniper fight where she calmly fire's from afar (Although ""calmly"" may be a bit strong since she was quite furious and Hasty in her killing) throwing the poor souls across the room. Smokin'Ace's action is very Top Notch.Humor- Honestaly the comedy in this movie is almost as good as the action, Never once could i stop laughing at the joke's that were so brilliantly implanted into the story line. The Tremor Brothers (Not positive if that is there real Alias) were by far the most funniest, craziest, redneck Assassins Ever. The humor was mature and vulgar just the way i like it.Suspense- Although not the strongest point in Smokin'Ace's most of the scenes had me waiting to see what was going to happen next, The part where the Assassin was in the elevator (Sadly i cannot remember his name) and had his poisoned razor still armed kept me guessing when it was going to pop out and kill someone. The ending was quite the tip of the ice cream as well, The music fit it really well and i think that really put me in the mood for the ending.Style- Personally i think this is the strongest point in Smokin Ace's if anyone here thinks that this movie lack's style, Then you obviously must have bin pussyfooting around while watching the movie. Buddy Isreal, Overflowing with style i couldn't get over his background and style, a Burnt out snitch that is currently in chaos, Not to mention the factor that he is a great card magician. The general background and individual style of all of the actors and there respective counter-parts are so slick and sly, they bring other Characters like ""Slevin"" and other ""Cool"" Characters to shame. (Don't get me wrong though i really enjoyed Lucky Number Slevin) Plot- Although i don't think i fully grasped the plot, it was quite a fantastic story. Although it would have bin nice if it showed a little more of what happened to some of the Assassins that seemingly ""Got Away"", And i wasn't to keen on what was with that ""Bunny"" suit. Only a few thing's i kind of wanted answered but never really got (That or i failed to put the pieces together)but all in all it was a great story/plot.Weapon(s)- Seriously i fell in love with the sniper rifle used in the movie and so did my friend's we were dieing to see that baby shoot, When it did we were just amazed(Accurate or Not it was impressive.)Although this woulden't really fall in the category for most movies the weapons in Smokin Ace's are fun and enjoyble (Yes we see gun's everyday in movies but the way they used them is what i enjoyed the most about them.) Also, i enjoyed buddy isreal's ""Weapon"" of choice Haha.Sound/Music- The Ace of Spade's is a personal favorite of mind and before i saw anything i knew that it would be in this movie, The sound effect's and music really fit almost all of the scenes perfectly. Somewhere i stated something about the end of the movie and how the music really put me in the mood, The music really helps a lot of the scenes flourish and i thought the general use of the sound effect's and music was very well picked and done.Smokin'Ace's a web tangled in that of a unique and strong Stylish-esquire of action packed fun, a Movie that makes all the characters fates interlock and compliment each others style and motive's, Smokin Ace's is far greater then i expected it to be. I can only say this if you did not like this movie, You must have bought a ticket to this movie and ran out after the first 15 second's and decided to go bash happy on it because this movie deserves far better then some treat it. I will proudly buy the DVD and re-watch it quite a few times. (Also can't wait to here the commentary) 9.5/10",Smokin' Aces
412,oxdvlshkssx,Just saw it and...,10,28 January 2007,"I thought it was amazing. Awesome cast, and I was absolutely amazed by Piven's performance. It was his character from Entourage mixed with a little mobster. Also I thought that the gore was awesome. Maybe its just me but its nice to see more than shootings and this movie definitely had it. However, it is not for the squeamish. This is a must see, regardless of how the Times or IMDb rated it. Since this has to be 10 lines I'd also like to warn people that it is a very confusing plot to follow in the beginning because the viewer is introduced to a lot of characters but as the movie goes on you catch on to their names and the roles they play. So don't lose interest because it is hard to follow at first, stick with it and you will not be disappointed.",Smokin' Aces
413,sfp5005,Pretty good overall,7,25 January 2007,"There was a fair amount of comedy, thrill, and action. Each element was delivered at the right moment. The premise of the movie is not too complex. The movie provides enough background information in order for you to enjoy the movie. You have to buy in to the contrivance that multiple people are going to try to kill one man on the top floor of a casino. If you get pass that, you will have a really good time. Character performances were great. It has an amazing cast. Wonderful performances are given to Ryan Reynolds in a serious role and Jeremey Piven.OVERALL...The story was good. This movie also had appealing eye-candy. You will get excited about this movie.",Smokin' Aces
414,jaredstrahorn,Waste of $,5,27 January 2007,"Absolute waste of a great cast. The premise is good, but the abilities of ALL the staring and supporting cast are wasted with a total disregard for character development. Chris Pine being a notable exception puts in a great performance in his supporting role of Darwin Tremor. The trailers and extended clips on the movies internet site contained the best parts. Certain portions should never have made it out of editing due to their irrelevance to the overall story. The film seems to be more devoted to gore and violence (fine if done for the sake of art). The camera work however is fantastic. I have nothing but respect for the the actors and director of this film. I only wish that they had a finished product worthy of their abilities. Smokin' Aces is like watching a video game as opposed to a movie.

Ryan Reynolds has been a favorite of mine for quite some time, and he played his role well, right to the end. the add karate kid in the shack was...hiflippinglarious. and i'm not very eloquent today, and this review isn't doing the film justice. but hey- both my girl and i were surprised by how good the movie was, and we plan to buy it. i loved it. kudos.",Smokin' Aces
416,ubergeak,I'm avoiding Joe Carnahan like a plague from now on.,1,14 February 2007,"This movie sucks. I must lack the genius and imagination of Carnahan, because I cannot, for the life of me, think of a way to make this movie worse. From *sharp* dialogue such as ""how bad is it?"" ""mortal"" ""what?"" ""mortal..."" to the completely over done and uninspired camera work that people have some how compared to lock stock and two smoking barrels. seriously folks, lets not insult good movies. the camera work was a joke. Carnahan is a joke. I have no idea how he went from Narc to this load of crap. When I walked out of Ultravoilet, I thought nothing could be worse than that movie. Then I went to Epic Movie and that lowered the bar of film going. To be honest I haven't seen that many horrible movies, except for the odd Sagal movies ...and Virus, so I can't say for sure, but at this point in time, Smokin' Aces has got to be The Worse Movie I have ever seen. I walked out of the theater thinking I would have rather sat through Epic Movie again...This movie was so bad it inspired me to write a comment on IMDb. This is the only movie which made me write a comment ..infact this is the only movie I've voted on in years. THAT'S HOW BAD THIS MOVIE IS. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. TRUST ME.Everyone who liked this movie is stupid. Everyone who thought the dialogue was smart, or the plot twist surprising is a MORON. The inane writing basically spoon fed you the ending. You people should be ashamed of yourselves for thinking this was something that remotely resembled intelligence.I gave this movie a rating of 1 because: a) IMDb won't let me give it a lower score, b) Ben Affleck died early on in the movie and c) Jason Batemen's performance was brilliant.The last two reasons are the only reasons why this movie shouldn't be thrown out with the trash.",Smokin' Aces
417,ak-ttfs,Cast Speaks for Itself,8,27 January 2007,"F.Y.I. This is my first movie review Every few years a movie comes out that i like to call a ""MAN-MOVIE"" Films such as Pulp Fiction, Gladiator, Casino, Fight Club, and the newest edition, Smokin"" Aces.I saw the trailer for this sometime in November and i have been looking forward to it ever since. I ever went as far as to put the trailer on my ipod so I could show it to my friends and get the hype up.Personally, I have a few basic rules that i use in order to judge a movie, and the most important is...Characters. If there are two or three enthralling characters, call me happy, but in ""Aces"" that number gets jacked up. Already being a huge fan of Ryan Reynold and of course Jeremy Piven, due to the ""Entourage"" Series, and anxious to see what Alicia Keys and Common could come up with due to the fact it was their first movie, i was not let down.I am the type of person that believes that a movie should go on as long as i has to in order to reach its full potential. Unfortunately 109 minutes will not cut it, with such strong bonds that these characters have formed i would have liked a few more ""Flashback"" scenes in order to feel what they felt when a strong emotional moment occurred.After the movie i was not let down, it was the kind of movie where anything could have happened, and in this particular movie, probably did, it was fast paced, funny, sad, and entertaining. With an exquisite performance by Jeremy Piven, and remarkable debut by Common and Alicia Keys.Overall i give ""Smokin' Aces"" an 8 out of 10",Smokin' Aces

419,saulegal,altogether a winner,9,28 January 2007,"it has been a long time since I have seen a good movie like this. It is full of everything i look for in a movie, comedy, violence, drama, and twists. The characters were well developed or at least developed to the point they needed to be. The plot was good, the setting was good, and the acting was good. It was worth every penny.It was a wonderful mix of real life situations and movie magic. some characters were a bit over the top, but as the movie goes on they became a little more refined or acceptable. There were also some parts i thought were excess but the nice part was that those scenes did not last long enough for it to bring down the rest of the movies overall show and plot.

420,iamchuckb05,"Wow, what crap",1,28 January 2007,"This is the dumbest movie I have ever seen. I came into it expecting something along the lines of Ocean's Eleven or Snatch but much more violent - clever and stylish, with a decent to above average story. Instead, I got ""Yogi Bear and the Spruce Goose"", but much more violent. Still, the movie could have been salvageable as just a shallow action movie; what really sent it over the edge for me was the ending. Without giving anything away, I can safely say it was so mind numbingly stupid I left the theater with my jaw hanging. It was not so much a plot twist as much as it was a plot sabotage. I am still debating whether this was actually meant to be the ending for another unrelated film and the directors just spliced it in and photoshopped the lead actors into it.

If I hadn't seen it at a fund raiser for a good cause, I would have walked out. 85 percent of this movie was spent explaining the plot, except basically there was none. The cartoonish, stereotypical characters were also presented with narration, because there wasn't anything resembling dialog to flesh them out. The ridiculous amount of violence served no purpose, both because it was so unrealistic and because the viewer doesn't care about any of the characters.

I know i couldn't act like i was that coked out as well as he did. It really made me believe he was in that situation.

The last half of the movie struggled through a bunch of unrealistic shootouts and obligatory explosions that were both predictable and redundant. I left the theater feeling embarrassed for Ray Liotta and Andy Garcia. Not so much for Ben Affleck - it was par for the course for him.One thing that I did like - when Pistol (Peter Berg) does the cartoony thing with a gunned down Jack Dupree's (Ben Affleck) mouth.

Yes, it was that bad. Basically, the whole thing made no sense. Throughout the film (I watched it at The Grove in Los Angeles), you heard sighs and moans from disgruntled movie-goers. Frankly, I was disgruntled when I walked out of the theater, as was everyone else. To its credit, the explosions and violence, albeit unbelievable and beyond any suspension of disbelief, was impressive. Leave it to Hollywood to make a a piece of crap movie but lure in the unsuspecting masses with fancy pyrotechnics and stunts. If you REALLY must see it, wait for it to come out on DVD.

However, this movie is about loyalty. Loyalty to your friends. This seems to be the biggest problem with most people I have spoken to.

It's not bad enough that the film is littered with heaps of gratuitous violence but just when you think it can't get any worse a young boy is shown getting an erection as he wields his numb-chucks in his underwear, directly in front of one of the ""bad guys."" Why you ask? Who the hell knows. It's a disgusting sight that serves no purpose in the story. It's irresponsible film-making. But it's not just irresponsible, no, no, no: it's also TERRIBLE film-making on top of that. The film doesn't know what it wants to be; it's at times over the top and then tries to get ""dramatic,"" especially with the shooting carnage that takes place at the end. This misguided approach heightens the bloodbath in a way that's almost disgusting. And lastly the ""reveal"" in the end is idiotic to say the least. Vile films like this give politicians in Washington ammunition in their plight for movie censorship.

My problem with the movie is that you don't really get that kick of excitement, the movie wants' you to have. It could be a lot more exciting if there wasn't so many damn names, and if the case on Israel where faster and with a little more shooting. Another problem with the movie is the scene where a man is getting shot, with a red Cadillac. Now it's of course not because there is a Cadillac in the scene, because i love Caddies, it's because the scene is in black and white, but the only thing that has a color, is the car. And the color is RED, exactly like Sin City, with Dwight and his red Caddie. That is so bad I think, because the scene is kind of wannabe Sin City. I love Sin City, and i think it's a brilliant movie, but people shouldn't steal ideas from the movie, even if it's brilliant, they have to come up with their own ideas!!

As you can see from the cast, there is a lot of quality actors, and Piven delivers his role almost surprisingly good. As the movie goes however, it changes too much in its genre. It starts as a hip ""snatch"" type with cool comments, but ends in more of a drama. But this change does not hurt the movie too much though. The movie also tries to make too many of the actors the main character, and the focus swaps to much. This can be confusing, but also ends up with some surprises.

The story moves very slowly to begin with--character introductions. Half of the characters were just for show. Poor Ben Affleck could've been an interesting part of the movie but they killed him off in the first half. There should have been only two sets of people after Israel--the heart removing assassin and the bounty hunters. Everybody else was fluff. Lots of good effects, but Ray Liotta lived far too long.

Ray Liotta stars as perhaps the most un-convincing Federal Agent in the history of film, Ryan Reynolds looks confused the entire time, and Jeremy Piven's character is poo. In the plus column, Alicia Keys provides the booty factor (effectively), and some skinhead characters provide giggles, but we're still WAY in the red as far as recommending this flying Rhinoceros of a film. Anyhoo, its actually worth renting, because Jason Bateman plays drunken, drugged up lawyer 'Rip Reed'. He's in two scenes, totalling MAYBE 4 minutes, but its just so good that its worth watching the whole film. Once his scenes are over, eject and throw away.",Smokin' Aces

The only thing that i hated were those Nazi German Hicks and most of the bounty hunters, they could have been a lot better. I mean, two chicks, i weird guy who makes masks and some Nazi German guys with chainsaws and shotguns and a screwed up car. Ryan Reynolds did a very good performance and so did Piven.It had a good plot and storyline and a very good script.Piven made a great performance and Reynolds made a great performance too. I hated that Karate kid, i wish that guy just punched him in the f'in head, and what was up with him getin' a boner while the guy was in the bath, that was really messed up. I don't know what you's guys are talking about, this was a great movie except for some mistakes that don't change my opinion on the movie too much. And you guys who said who it was predictable. During that scene where Ray Liotta was in the elevator with that Spanish guy, i did not expect both of them to shoot each other up like that.",Smokin' Aces
439,deadrogue-1,Time you'll never get back. If only it were 1/10th the movie it thinks it is...,1,30 October 2007,"This movie is absolute garbage. First 10 minutes: we're given a rapid-fire who's who of all the characters, notably Primo Sparazza (the mob boss), Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, and some guy no one knows anything about, called ""the Swede"". Not much is given beyond what you read here and it never really appears to matter.It's apparent from the writing that this film thinks it's a Tarantino-style romp, complete with interesting side-dialogue and compelling characters. The problem is that the side-dialogue (featuring such gems as ""you jizzed on my 12 thousand dollar jacket"") is puerile, contrived and hideously over-written while the ""compelling characters"" are implausible to the point that it's distracting and annoying.For example: two female contract killers (Taraji Henson and Alicia Keys, the latter is gorgeous throughout, but that won't save this lemon) are among the cast of assassins looking to cash in on the ""get Ace"" contract. We're given the background that they are up-and-coming pros whose last gig was to take out ""the Triad"". Tee hee.On to the Aces job: from a different hotel, Sharice Watters (Henson) targets Georgia Sykes (Keys) with a sniper rifle, presumably finding the range for her shot(s). Inexplicably, we see her hover the sight over Sykes' heart and head while she talks about her love for her... Was there some hidden tension? A Rivalry? It doesn't matter. Like the rest of the film, nothing meaningful will come of it.Later, when Watters believes Sykes to have been killed, she starts shooting up the hotel with a massive 50 calibre rifle. This is the kind of professional, emotionally-detached behaviour we expect from an elite contract killer... Yeah, no.After some more farcical action sequences and lame-duck efforts at character development, we learn that ""the Swede"" is not the enigmatic, master assassin we've been led to believe he is. No. He is an expert cardiologist who will perform a life-saving transplant on the mob boss (we've now learned the boss is actually a deep-cover FBI agent), using Aces' heart! This ""twist"" would be clever if it wasn't so utterly stupid. Even worse, you see it coming from about 40 minutes away and spend the last half of the movie hoping you're wrong.After the whole story (in case you were asleep and needed a recap) is rehashed by Andy Garcia (Stanley Locke, FBI chief) for the benefit of confused (no wonder) and angry Ryan Reynolds (Richard Messner, FBI peon), we're treated to some more ridiculous dialogue and inadvertent situation-comedy: Messner has just made a death-threat against Locke and demanded to know the whole story. Once he's filled in, he's then left in the hospital room with Sparazza and Israel in their beds on either side of him, comatose or sedated before the coming transplant. He unplugs both from their life-support. Not only is it unclear as to why either is even on life-support, it's more annoying and implausible that this unstable agent is allowed to be alone in their high-security, bullet-proof-glass-enclosed room. Have I used the word implausible yet?More lowlights: Aces plays with a deck of cards all the time. ALL the time. And he can flick a card so hard that it will stick in your furniture or your eye! Don't laugh until you see it...One of the assassins kills people and then pours latex on their heads to make a mask that he will use to impersonate them. Here's the thing, when you pour latex (or whatever the compound is, into a box containing your victim's face/head, you get an imprint of their head, not a mask. You would then need to use this imprint to pour a second time, making the mask. Imagine trying to do all of this in 10-15 minutes...Normally, these weaknesses could be dismissed with the ""it's an action movie"" wink. Thing is, Smokin' Aces takes itself so seriously that you just can't.Someone owes me 108 minutes.",Smokin' Aces

And as good as Alicia Keys is too look at, and listen too, her skills are not on the silver screen.Who would this appeal too?, hard to say.

The build-up to the main action of the movie was interesting. It almost reminded me of ""What's Up Doc?"" (a classic comedy with Ryan O'Neal and Barbara Streisand, among others) in that there was a convergence of some quirky and intriguing characters, all moving toward the same objective, but none being immediately aware of the others. This could have and should have produced an exciting, chaotic and wild ending with all these wild, crazy people ending up in the same place at the same time. It also began and developed as something of a dark comedy. But then came.....what? A stupid plot twist, a useless, pseudo-dramatic ending, completely out of sync with everything which occurred previously, all of which was centered upon an annoying, boring, brooding character about whom I couldn't have cared less. Great promise as it began, utterly stupid as it wrapped up in a cheap and disappointing fashion.

The ensemble cast is killer - Piven is superb as Buddy Israel, Jason Bateman and Chris Pine steal their scenes with their comic relief, and Ryan Reynolds and Ray Liotta are solid as the ""straight"" guys opposite all of the degenerate lowlifes. The ensemble cast - also including Ben Affleck, Martin Henderson, Peter Berg, Matthew Fox, Andy Garcia, and many others - really flesh this movie out and keep it moving at a break-neck pace. The plot is somewhat far-fetched and some of the characters are more like cartoon caricatures, but it's a fun movie with a lot of peaks and valleys that keeps you guessing.

Nothing made sense, there was no cohesion, and it was in no way believable. Jeremy Piven was not believable as a magician, much less as a mobster. If I ever see any of these actors on the street I'm asking them for my boyfriend's 8 dollars back. I'm disappointed that IMDb wont let me give it a rating of less than one.

I especially liked the ""Kung Fu Kid"".. where and why he was in this I don't know, but he was certainly a good foil here.This isn't a Chick flick, and neither is it a great detective story... from start to end it is continuous setup action.. sometimes you see it coming, sometimes you don't...

447,drnrg31-944-103219,A smoking roller coaster ride,9,8 January 2011,"First off I can't see why some people don't like this movie? It has everything, Action, blood, mafia, some drama and great story line. I'm guessing they are all haters of this kind of genre film? I see some of the stupidest comments about why this and why that? If you really pay attention to the film, you will realize that every scene is exactly how it was meant to be filmed. It could best be summed up in one phrase. ""Over the top""..and that is what makes the film so enjoyable in the first place. It's all those quirky unbelievable scenes that make a usual Tarrantino or Guy Ritchie film ,what they are. Exciting.The plot line is simple. Buddy ""Aces"" Israel, Vegas entertainer of the year and wannabe ""wise guy"" is being kept in a Taho luxury suite, because he has now decided to turn on the very people that made him a starr;. The Mob. The word gets out that they have put a 1 million dollar bounty on his head and this causes every hit-man/mercenary/bounty hunter to show up and try to collect the prize money. This is where the fun begins. Ina very hip narrative fashion, FBI Director ;Andy Garcia(Locke) and sleezebag bondsman; Ben Affleck(Dupree)introduce the audience to the uncanny array of Hit men. You got ""El Estrago""; the central American Torture specialist. The Tremor Brothers; Three whacked out Neo Nazi killers, who also supply the film's comic relief at times. You got ""Soot"", The European disguise artist and finally Alicia Keys and and her wanna be lesbian friend; Sharice to round up the crew of rogue Mercenaries...and if that isn't enough, then you can throw in Bailbondsman ,Ben Affleck and two ex cops into the mix.For the feds, you have two of cinema's finest with Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta ,playing Lock and Carrathures, respectively. Both portray their roles flawlessly, though I didn't quite agree with Garcia's New York/southern accent. You also have the hero; Ryan Renolds. He gets the hardest part, because he is the one who ends up picking up all the broken pieces and tries to put them together. It's also interesting to see him play a serious role rather well and hopefully he can continue to explore similar roles in the future...and last ,but certainly not least, is the title role of Buddy Israel, aptly playing the card mechanic/Illusionist/magician. I say aptly, because he pulls some impressive acting skills out of a hat. His character is on a an emotional roller-coaster ride throughout the film. Much at times, being completely wasted on coke, but still manages to cope with the hardest decisions a human being can make in a lifetime. I compare his role a lot to ""Scarface"". Once an top of the world , now slowly falling apart at the seems right before out eyes.Once the viewer understands the ""Players"" and their roles; the rest of the film makes perfect sense. The Over The Top scenes are completely in sync with each character's background. Hence, the Tremore brothers charging from elevators with machetes and chainsaws and feds and mercenaries dueling it out in elevators ala Resorvoire Dogs style. all this Over the Top fun is strictly old school Grindhouse, just in a different time frame. The comedy is in the fact that all these hit men look completely out of place in Hotel uniforms, yet they somehow inconspicuously blend in with hotel employees. Check out the Tremor brother with a Mohawk blending in with hotel staff or ""El Estrago"" posing as a fed and for eye candy; Alicia Keys as a high class escort. Its all meant to be ridiculously out of place and yet somehow feels just right.Not to spoil the fun, but this movie really impressed me the way that the characters go through several metamorphoses throughout the film. Sometimes even in a one scene. I'm guessing it was meant to be this way and surprises like these really remind me of Michael Madson's role in Resoviore Dog's.To round it off, you get the anticipated Explosions, blood and action that every action movie should have, but you also get a very ""I didn't see that coming"" twist endings that should at least make you wonder how valuable a man's life can really be and is it worth sacrificing your life for. That there, would be the drama part of the movie.I closing, I recommend the movie to all Tarrantino and Guy Ritchie fans. It does a fine job capturing the vibe of said directors. It might not be the next ""Pulp Fiction"", but it holds its own as a cool action guy flick, best viewed on a wide plasma screen with 5.1 surround sound.",Smokin' Aces

""Smokin' Aces"" is definitely like that. While it's not a bad movie, it's still far from as good as it could have been.I think the movie started out pretty well. It's got an almost ""Lock Stock""-like quality to it where it presents all the main characters in different sequences. After that you feel the stage is set and the guns loaded. Unfortunately then you get the first dip in pace, and the movie never really recovers. Sure, you get a few laughs and some pretty well-done action scenes. But the pace really never picks up and lives up to the promise of the beginnings.It's difficult for me to put my finger on why i didn't really like this movie. Like i said before it's not bad and it was fairly entertaining. Perhaps my expectations were wrong? I expected something more fast-paced and hysterical, while this is a lot more sombre in pace. The good points are the actors, not that they're great but most of them are pretty good in their parts and many of them are quite funny. Also the action scenes are pretty well done. The negative parts is that i would have liked more action, a quicker pace and a lot less bewildering ending (without giving anything away).I think most people who like action movies might like this one. It works pretty well, although there are quite a lot of things to improve. I give it a 6/10.",Smokin' Aces
451,reelbigloser19,the movie was just as great as i expected...,9,4 February 2007,"First of all, anyone that is going to dismiss the film as crap should at first explain WHY (with solid, valid, concrete reasons) the movie is crap rather than re-state how ""terrible"" it is in 20 different ways. By claiming that it was overindulgent on violence is a completely idiotic summary for a movie WITH THE TAGLINE ""MAY THE BEST Hit-man WIN."" Are you kidding me? Were you expecting pillow fights? Were you expecting gunshots with no blood and gore to follow? It totally delivered, killing off good guys and bad guys in unforeseen ways.The movie immediately immerses the viewer into action, hardly wasting a second. The first hit-man is killed within maybe the first 30 minutes. There's such a variety of characters (and INTERESTING ones at that -- hardly a bland one in the bunch) and such nonstop action that the fact that I refused to go to the bathroom until the end of the movie despite the urgent need to do so about halfway through.There's definitely and underlying suspense throughout the entire movie that keeps building until the end. Towards the beginning of the movie you're wondering why there's a hit on Israel. Halfway through you're wondering which hit-man's going to get to him. Towards the end you're wondering what the truth is. So to say there are twists within Smokin' Aces is quite a valid statement.Perhaps the strongest aspect of this movie is the strength of its characters. It's no secret that Smokin' Aces has a great cast, but you should at least know that that shows up on the screen as well. With such a large list of characters, you don't get that much time to spend on any particular one -- so you have to make each one interesting, unique and dynamic and do so quickly -- to leave the impression. my favorites? the tremors -- with rip (jason bateman's character) close behind.the dialogue is also great. the crowd was definitely laughing at quite a good handful of moments throughout an action-packed flick. it's a solid blockbuster.if you're expecting an underground indie-sensation that tactfully deals with off-ing a decent amount of its cast ... well, then you weren't paying attention to the trailer, the cast, or the tagline.",Smokin' Aces

Fine....I can deal with an easy plot twist.The hit men were a bit far-fetched and outrageous and very unrealistic, but that made things fun. What really made me hate this movie is the way it ended. The ending made the entire sequence of events throughout the entire film absolutely pointless. If the ending was better I could deal with this movie just being a fun action flick....but alas, the ending....which was filled with an overly attempted try at surprise outcomes and meaningless turns of events really ruined the whole thing.

454,ChristianOskam,Great cast... such a shame,6,27 January 2007,"I had high expectations for this film originally because of the cast: Jeremy Piven is brilliant in ""Entourage"", Andy Garcia is an old favourite of mine, Ray Liota has had some great roles, and i'll even admit that Ryan Reynolds films are somewhat a guilty pleasure of mine. However, as is usually the case when hopes are too high, I was quite disappointed.I cannot say that this is an utter stinker because a few scenes are quite good and at times entertaining. Piven is still captivating playing the role of a showman foreseeing his end, but he is not involved enough for my liking; same goes for Liota. The unnecessary gore of one scene where a chainsaw and machetes are used by an assassin group instead of conventional (yet much more effective) guns left me asking if this is what really passes for entertainment these days. Reynolds, despite my earlier statement, is too mechanical for any serious dramatic scenes, and when these came it was almost painful to watch.The numerous subplots, of which this film is basically made, are edited well enough and the sense of pace they produce does create a feeling of excitement, yet i am not sure that they were all necessary. Psychotic Neo-Nazis, a pseudo-lesbian duo??? Again, is this supposed to be entertaining? Maybe it is, and i'm sure many men would agree that a close-up of Keys groping herself is not a bad thing, but it was still superfluous and, i felt, below both of the actresses involved in the scene.Still, despite it's flaws, this film could have been saved by a good ending, yet what was provided was fairly obvious and almost nonsensical. I won't go into it but the final scene is a disaster. If you want to see a movie similar to this without most of the flaws rent Lucky Number Slevin.

The plot was very well thought out, but sometimes loses the audience if they're not paying close enough attention. The hit men were almost flawlessly played out.

If this record is not already in the favour of Hollywood, then Smokin' Aces does another attempt in making it so, with the combination of mobster and hit men movie, and of course the common enemy, FBI. So the main plot is about some old mobster, who is slowly dying, meanwhile some other mobster is about to cut a deal with the FBI, and some third group of mobsters put a 1mio price on the second guys head. So, all the ingredients for a movie accounted for. Unfortunately the writer seems to think, that meanwhile prior mobster movies has been successful just focusing on the power play, and hit men movies on the violence, this movie shall have it all, at the same time, and not just 1 hit men, but loads of them! The result is a predictable movie, where the biggest problem is making heads and tail on all the people, rather then actually solving the mystery.Add to that, in 2007 there are certain standards for good action movies. One being that the entire cinema must be on the edge by the complex action plot. Plots where nobody figures out who is goanna die, and who's not, until the last bullet have been fired. Granted, it is hard, if not impossible, to tell in this movie, but in this movie they missed the ""complex"" part, trying to be thrilled by the killing is like watching dices being rolled, without any apparent stakes, it seems completely random and pointless anyway. Some people gets killed, and so what, since the director couldn't be bothered to give a serious introduction to anyone, then why should I care? Instead I spend my time being amazed by the lag of brains in the various characters. I expect that the characters actions do not seem clearly motivated by the director. I want to be tricked into believing that these people actually could exist, and I am very easily tricked, but when the new James Bond did a better job on this, then it's simply not good enough.So who to blame for this? Writer or director? Well I'll be damned; it's the same man",Smokin' Aces
461,rexmantlepiece,God this movie is awful!!!!,1,19 August 2007,"This movie is terrible. Complete waste of time. Characters were two dimensional, I couldn't care less about any of them. The story was weak. I saw the ""twist"" coming a mile away. The look of the movie was cool and editing very well done, but the rest a total waste. You know the era following Pulp Fiction in the nineties when you saw all these Tarrantino rip- offs? -- Well that's this, about ten years too late!I don't get the whole fascination with Joe Carnahan. Was Narc really that great? Never heard it was that good. It totally slipped under my radar. I wish this did.",Smokin' Aces
462,EmperorPilaf,"An incredibly fun, horribly misunderstood piece of film",9,2 August 2013,"I want to start by saying that I understand why the reviews for Smokin' Aces are so bipolar. With a cast full of so many familiar faces - Reynolds, Affleck, Piven, I could go on - it's easy to see how more critical moviegoers might have expected some sort of artistic finesse to be nestled into the chaotic free-for-all that is this movie's plot. And, to be fair, there is none; but was any really promised? I've seen many reviews compare Carnahan to Tarantino, but I fail to see why that's called for. Sure, Tarantino can be called the grandfather of gritty and gratuitously gory action flicks, but does that really mean every movie that falls into the genre needs to be compared to him? Not every rock band is Led Zeppelin, and not every adrenaline-filled bullet fest is Pulp Fiction. Leave it alone.As far as the movie itself goes, Smokin' Aces does a terrific job of keeping the viewer entertained by using a simple, yet brilliant plot scheme; introduce several different factions full of wild, exaggerated characters, pack them all into the same building with the same objective, and watch as a series of mismatched encounters ultimately leads up to an explosive finale. And yes, maybe Carnahan should have stopped at that; some might say that there was no need for the twist ending, but I think it added a certain flavor. Without going into too much detail, it actually gives the story a nice context, like a soft- serve ice cream cone after a long day of splashing around frantically at the beach. I don't think he was trying to blow our minds with some Fight Club-esque turn of events, he just wanted some mildly thought-provoking punctuation to end his thrill ride of a sentence.What I truly loved about this movie was the fact that it almost forces you to pick favorites; it shoves the diverse cast of competing gunslingers in your face, flaunts their dysfunctional personalities and cutthroat techniques, then hurls them at each other so violently that it's a wonder anyone survives. The resulting heptagon of a plot is almost sure to leave you cheering for one of the cold-blooded killers, or maybe for the FBI agents played by Reynolds and Liotta as they struggle to keep up. From the rogue tactics of Lazlo Soot to the guns blazing approach of the redneck neo-Nazi Tremor brothers, there seems to be a psychopathic personality that corresponds to every type of viewer.The bottom line for me is that Smokin' Aces is a film that is meant to be fun; it's messy and unrealistic and contains about as much depth as an above-ground pool, but it does a DAMN good job of being fun. If you're looking for a rabbit hole plot or a breathtaking performance by your favorite actor or a ten-layered masterpiece of cinematography and visual art, then this is not the movie for you. If you want to kick back and enjoy a roller-coaster of muzzle flash and blood splash injected with an amped-up soundtrack and laced with reckless comedy, then Smokin' Aces should be right up your alley.",Smokin' Aces
463,Clinically_Inane,Smokin' Aces (Kinda Spoilers),9,5 January 2007,"Little prelude to this - I've been waiting to see ""Smokin' Aces"" since my friend downloaded the trailer on his X-Box 360. So you can imagine my thrill when my friends from UW managed to finagle some passes to a special pre-screening. You know, the pre-screening where the press has 4 rows reserved for them in the back of the theater.So this movie was, as we all expected from the trailer, violent as hell.That being said, it was damn good. A lot of people will expect to be a wham, bam, thank you ma'am action. I went in not expecting much more than a ""Transporter"" type movie. A lot of fighting and not that much story.But very much to my surprise, while it did have a lot of really good action, the storyline was quite well done. There was also a good amount of humor.Basic plot line goes as this: There's this wannabe mob boss who gets targeted by a rival family after making some stupid decisions and getting busted by the FBI. The movie revolves around 4 or 5 different groups of Hit men (and Hitwomen) who have heard about the $1 Million bounty on Buddy ""Aces"" Isreal.My personal favorite of the hit men were the Tremors. These southern country-bumpkin hit-family reminded me a bit of the Reavers from ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" just because of their ruthless brutality (and a bit of how they looked). They were hilarious and awesome at the same time.I'm a big fan of Jeremy Piven from his character Ari in Entourage, and he does a great job as Buddy ""Aces"" Isreal. He looks strung out as all holy hell and you can just feel sleaze oozing from his pores, not to mention he can do some pretty rad card tricks.The real scene-stealer, though, is Ryan Reynolds. It's a kind of different role for him. He doesn't really have a lot of the snide banter that we've come to expect from him after movies such as ""Van Wilder,"" ""Waiting,"" and ""Blade: Trinity."" He does a great job as an FBI agent who gets caught in the middle of this entire ordeal.This movie got my respect in the first 30 minutes after they just killed off one of the main name actors. I'm not gonna tell you which one, but it was awesome.A fantastic movie that you should all see. Don't get me wrong, it's no ""The Departed,"" but it will definitely get your adrenaline going and you will be on the edge of your seat.Check it out in theaters January 26.P.S. 50 cal. sniper rifle = rad as hell",Smokin' Aces
464,malbrigand,"Predictable, pointless, pathetic",3,28 January 2007,"God only knows what the previous reviewer was on about; perhaps he saw a different film to me. Smokin Aces is an abysmal example of cinema. The premise is actually decent, but the plot is horrendously predictable. The majority of the characters are poor and, while some of the action is impressive with decent cinematography, ultimately it's a mish-mash of action scenes that are completely and utterly pointless. This movie is one for the mid-teen playstation brigade.The only reason this movie gets more than 1 star is Ryan Reynolds who actually puts in a very solid performance; the rest of the cast however are clearly just going through the motions, Ben Affleck in particular was awful.",Smokin' Aces

The actors are lame, Andy Garcia saves the day, the rest sucked big time. The movie it's very explosive trying desperate to impress, it does at first but in the end it's disappointing. Characters are copied, the story is not original and the director is clearly a fan of the English director(Guy Ritchie). Alicia Keys, please, Ben Affleck is worse than her, and Ray Lliota is finished, he can retire in peace.If you don't have anything else to see, u can try this movie, some will like it, others won't.",Smokin' Aces
466,Brainiac138,Too many characters not doing a whole lot,5,26 January 2007,"Here is a movie that is a bit like a remote control car running out of battery power, sometimes it gets a nice spurt and goes for a second, but most of the time it just kind of putters around. It is not the fault of some of the actors, as I was impressed with Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck, Jason Bateman and Alicia Keyes. Others who usually blow me away, or at least keep me entertained- Andy Garcia, Jeremy Piven, and Ray Liotta, just seemed not interested in anything of the scenes they were in, this is especially bad for Piven, as the movie revolves around him.Piven plays a Vegas illusionist, who has learned to make great weapons of cards, that in itself would make a great movie, but in Smokin Aces he is a mob informant under protective custody so he can turn states evidence and get a new identity. The idea of new identity is a theme that comes up throughout the movie, most dramatically with a chameleon hit-man who has the fastest drying mask mold in the history of mankind. Anyway, when a million dollar bounty is put on Piven's character, Buddy ""Aces"" Isreal, seven of the most colorful hit men and women in history come to collect.And this is where the movie falls apart. It seems writer/director Carnahan had too many great ideas for great characters, but not a clear enough idea of how to make them fit in the story. I have read that Carnahan considers this an homage to the great early films of the Coen Brothers, and with a group of redneck, psychotic, Neo-nazi hit men called the Tremor Bros., well they could have easily came from Raising Arizona. But where the Coen Brothers are exceedingly consistent with maintaining crazy colorful characters and dark humor, Carnahan falls short. This forces a very phony sounding speeches that I felt were trying to hard to heighten dramatic tension-as well as a very predictable ending that any fan of the likes of Usual Suspects will pick up on.This movie had the potential to be something special, but too many characters hurt it, especially hit men such as the Blade, who seemed to fit in the movie just to have a shootout with Ray Liotta. The movie was not entirely a mess, there are great moments of dark comedy, the Tremors and the bailbondsmen scene in the parking lot comes to mind, as well as some decent enough action scenes. And even though Carnahan seems to despise this comparison, it did seem a bit lifted from a few Guy Ritchie films and that made the film seem tired. Had he stayed with the same tone of films like Barton Fink and Raising Arizona then, well, it would have been a totally different affair.",Smokin' Aces
467,christopherpoulopoulos,Very poor,3,11 April 2007,"There is a painful lack of depth on all levels, but from my point of view there where two things that stood out as the major flaws in this film. Firstly, the characters, so two-dimensional they might as well have used cardboard cut outs. Stereotypes can be entertaining, but I think they need to be extremely fresh and original if they are to be used as more than a simple supporting/comic relief type role. In this film they are used to the point of exhaustion and they are nothing that has not been seen time and time again. Secondly, the storyline. The storyline seems to serve the purpose of creating a suitable stage for the characters to ""shine"", by creating opportunities and circumstances that allow the use of clever dialogue and general cool behaviour. Despite the tediously over-stereotyped characters and average dialogue, this would still have worked to a certain extent. Unfortunately, not content with this, a series of bizarre and pointless twists where added (as an after-thought it would appear) in an effort to make this film something more. The end result is simply confusing and my personal opinion laughable. Consider a 15 year old teenage boy that has spent all his life in an isolated air bubble being introduced to Tarantino and Guy Richie movies, hip hop videos and a little bit of Goodfellas in the space of a weekend, then giving him a fairly large budget and free reign on making a film.The result would not be far off from Smoking Aces.",Smokin' Aces
468,Chiefbarba,Not What You'd Expect from the Previews,4,17 February 2007,"The film was a disappointment. It's not the film you would expect from the previews. There were some funny lines, some good action, and the soundtrack was at times engaging. Oddly, there even were a few scenes that were strangely dramatic. And while the drama was moving, it felt misplaced in what is ultimately supposed to be a suspenseful action film. Like all of these types of films, it promises a lot in the beginning with the fast-paced introduction of multiple characters, but by the end you're not sure for which character you want to root. Also, the ""twist"" in the plot is predictable. Halfway through the film it ceases to be what you likely went to the cinema to enjoy. Maybe if my expectations had been different, I might have enjoyed the film. Nevertheless, if you expect a decent plot that delivers solid action and developed characters, then you're likely to be let down by this film.",Smokin' Aces
469,Tonka_Deejay,A stylish mess up,1,11 June 2011,"The first time I watched the movie I rated it six stars outta ten, mainly because I thought the action scenes looked kinda cool, but the story and pacing were a total mess up. So recently I watched the movie on TV again, and I just couldn't believe how badly this has aged in a retrospect second view. I couldn't help but stare in awe how messed up could be a decent story idea be adapted into a movie.The story tries to be clever and complex, but the bad pacing, editing, and miscellaneous weird directorial decisions make it very confusing and leaves a vague feeling.The acting is good, but there are so many notable actors here, and they all get so little screen time overall, and this consequently also hurts the movie! Also, the decisions and how the characters react in certain situations is really weird a lot of times, but I'll add this to bad screen writing.Overall the biggest flaw is the editing - it aims for the stylish way of 'Snatch' but it fails mid way through the movie. So the stylish clever action movie fails and tries to redeem itself with a huge twist in the ending, but it fails again because its loose ends.Like I said, I've seen it twice - the first time I kinda liked it, or forced myself to like it. But with a second view years later the movies flaws quickly point out, and they'll leave a bad taste.Great story, nice characters, good actors, great director. But bad editing, pacing and executing - makes it almost unwatchable (except the action scenes, those are still kinda cool).",Smokin' Aces
470,guitarist_joseph_king,A good movie to watch with your pals.,10,26 January 2007,"I went to theaters with two friends and got to watch it for free, and I was not disappointed. It has an all-star cast, interesting story, and lots of plot twists. The story was fast paced but if your not careful you could miss key points of the story that could throw you off completely. By the end of the movie you really feel for the characters, even the less developed ones. It has a very Shakespearian feel to it. The soundtrack was brilliant especially the ending song & Piven is great as ""Ace"" and Ryan Reynolds provided a masterful performance in a very dramatic role, it was also nice to see Liotta back in a major film, he was sorely missed.The movie clicked fairly well, and hopefully will get some credit for the amount of effort put forth by the cast and crew.I must admit, that although Nestor Carbonell's character Pasquale was my favorite, the audience enjoyed mostly Chris Pine & the rest of the Tremor brothers as well as Jason Bateman's ""Reed"" character.All and all it did what it was made for. It provided a few hours of solid entertainment. Though it was bombed by critics I hope that ""Smokin' Aces"" will be one of those films that go on to acquire Cult classic standing.Superb.Also this film gave me a little taste of the same feeling that Reservoir Dogs did when I first saw it.One word.Excellent.It is totally worth your money.",Smokin' Aces
471,DigItAllAnalOG,...Could have been two different movies. Enjoyable Overall.,6,31 January 2007,"I'm not going to trash this movie, but I'm not going to really praise it either. Smokin' Aces was an interesting movie, but it felt sort of thrown together. I'm a fan of a good sub-plot, but there was WAY too much going on. I feel like it could have been two different movies entirely. One moment you have this awesome, zany action-comedy and all the characters work really well. On the other hand, you have pseudo-seriousness action drama going on that is polar opposite to what the movie was portrayed to be. The two tones clash, and they clash hard.The cast overall was great, although most of them turned out to be pointless. The only really problem I had with casting and performances was Andy Garcia, who is usually stellar. I mean, when Ben Affleck's accent is more convincing then Andy Garcia's, that leaves something to be said. Some of the quirks in the characters fell a little flat. Alicia Keys was hot and sexy as usual, and her performance was executed well, not surprisingly. Jeremy Piven, Ray Liotta, and Ryan Reynolds definitely were my favorites throughout the movie. Jeremy Piven continues to surprise me because let's face it. The man can act. I used to wonder if he used to just practice being a dick because he really is so good at it. Also, I have to show my love for the Tremor Brothers. I mean, they were just insanity personified.All in all, if your a male, have a pulse, and like a good time, Check it out. Some of its flaws are forgivable and some aren't. Worth seeing.",Smokin' Aces
472,MaroonSecret12,Smokin Aces and Everyone's Brains into Mush,2,29 January 2007,"This had to be the most pointless movie ever. The actors are completely B-list, no one does a great acting job, and the ending could have been way better. Jeremy Piven is hilarious on ""Entourage"", no one can really deny that, but seeing him as yet another big hot-shot was disappointing. Buddy ""Aces"" Israel could have been funnier, but instead was a drug addled pathetic loser. I had no sympathy for him whatsoever, which is probably not what you're supposed to think seeing as he has a group of vulgar, overly violent hit men (and women) after him. As much as you would want to root for several would-be assassins, they too are pointless and blatantly stupid. The Neo-Nazis are disgusting and just plain insane, the lesbian hit-women's relationship isn't clear, the FBI agents are flat and emotionless, and the rest of the hit men can easily be confused.While the movie did have it's okay parts (I say okay, because nothing in this movie is actually worth quoting let alone remembering) it is overall a jumbled mess of vulgarity, stupidity and over the top violence that tries to hard too hard to get the audience to really care about anyone.

It sported such an ensemble cast that it seemed like every scene in the first half of the movie had me thinking either ""HE'S in this too?!"" or ""Where the heck have I seen HIM before?"" Fittingly for a movie in which the title (but by no means main) character is a magician, the plot had a bit of misdirection to throw the viewers off its true motives.

Watch it a few times to get the whole story before you make a stupid review. How many years did it take humanity to recognize Van Gogh and some other painters and writers? Some times it took decades. So remember kids cinema is art not an excuse to eat popcorn.Now the Smoking Aces: It goes through almost all the emotions. It's funny, it's sad, it's annoying, it's cool, it's hip and it shoots up the place. Good story, cool characters and a few great actors.

475,LibbyLuWho,WOW! This was definitely worth seeing!,8,28 January 2007,"I was blown away by how this movie surpassed my expectations. Aside from the stellar casting, and great performances, the plot was complex, and it had a bit of a twist at the end that you really didn't see coming. I expected this to be a little more campy, kind of a comedy, but it wasn't at all. There were some humorous moments throughout that made me laugh out loud, but it was heart pumping action all the way to the end. I give major kudos to Ryan Reynolds, who I thought was outstanding in this dramatic role. We're so used to seeing him play the funny man, but this turn was phenomenal. Ray Liotta, and Andy Garcia were, as always, great in there respective roles. Alicia Keys held her own, and did a very good job, as did Common. I'm not really very familiar with him, but was impressed by him. Ben Affleck had a minor role, and made the most of it, but the best cameo by far was Jason Bateman. He was great!

Once the lights went down and I saw Ray Liotta and Ryan Reynolds in a stake out, the film just grabs you.The story is multifaceted, but in a way that flows together perfect. Echoing Guy Ritchie's 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', 'Smokin' Aces' has a diverse group of characters (including Alicia Keyes in her first major film role - by the way, she did a great job) who are entertaining to watch. The first is Buddy Israel (played to a drug binged T by Jeremy Piven), who is the hit, which might cause a coo in the Mob. You feel sorry for him as his time is running out and he has to make difficult decisions that might end up leaving him without anyone to protect him.Ben Affleck is surprisingly amusing as ex-cop Jack Dupree. Depsite his Fu Man Shoo, he is fun to watch for the 30 minutes that he is on screen. Chris Pine, from 'The Princess Diaries 2', is a great lunatic hit man. I was surprised by his performance since he has been in two tween movies and he had not impressed me that much (other than the fact that he is a adorable).Ryan Reynolds finally proved himself to be a serious, heart wrenching actor. I was extremely impressed with his acting in this film since I'm pretty sure everyone is used to his comedy roles. I never pictured him in a serious film, but he has gone well beyond my expectations.Just see this movie! I don't want to spoil it for everyone.

Booger(from ""Revenge of the Nerds"")was good in his small roll. You can't really go wrong with this cast.2. The Music - the music was great. It kept a cool feel throughout the movie, almost like a Tarantino movie. 3. Post Production - Post production really saved this movie. Being that they didn't have much to work with, they did a great job making this chaotic movie watchable and enjoyable.CONS: 1. The Directing - His inexperience in directing these types of movies really showed. You kinda got the feeling that he wasn't sure what type of movie he wanted to make. Sometimes it was like a cool Tarantino flick, then it gets serious like his ""Narc"", then he throws in a funky plot twist reminiscent of ""Lucky Number Slevin"".2. The Script - To put it bluntly the script a little too square for this type of movie. There was no creativity with the way the words were put together. It was very normal and adequate. In this type of movie you want fresh, hip slang and the characters talking circles around you so that you want to rewind it to hear to again and again. ALL in ALL it was pretty enjoyable.

I understood roughly half of the dialogue and roughly a quarter of the scenes. There is nothing for anyone in this movie. There is no decent dialogue, no decent action, no decent comedy, no decent sfx, and no decent filmmaking. Those who enjoyed this film unironically are most certainly are the same people who cut you off in traffic and act like you were the idiot. 1/10. There is almost nothing worse.

Everything from the slang-speaking semi-lesbian Sharice to the Ritalin child to the behavior of the savage Neo-Nazi mercenary trio is painfully lame and groan inducing. Many scenes and moments seemed to be either pointless or an ATTEMPT to appear profound. The action and special effects were respectable, but the utter lack of realism (with respect to gunshot wounds) was laughably bad.

From Piven to Affleck to Common to Keys, there were some pretty decent performances...my personal favorite being Jason Bateman's (man I love that guy). There were also some cool bullet effects and such....but... ~puts megaphone to mouth~THE ACTION SUCKED, THE STORY SUCKED, THE MOVIE SUCKEDIf you see this movie anyway, but end up agreeing with me, donate $10 to some sort of charity for children or rainforests or something to clear your conscience. I'm done with this nonsense.",Smokin' Aces
488,thuperthamxtreme,Jeremy Piven rocks your damn face off!,8,30 January 2007,"Alright, I'm gonna start off by saying, yes, I am extremely biased when it comes to bloody action movies and the one-and-only Jeremy Piven. I think he's an INCREDIBLE actor with a great wit and a lovable, jerk charm to him (haha, Jeremy, if by any chance you're reading this now I LOVE YOU).That being said...I actually really, really liked Smokin Aces. I'm no movie buff, and I guess you can say I have strange tastes in movies, but I'll be damned, I was very entertained by this. I thought the humor was definitely there, and Alicia Keys and Common totally proved their acting worth. Jason Bateman, of Arrested Development fame (FUNNIEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN END OF STORY), cracks me up with the self-loathing dialog that he sneaks in at any possible moment, while the Tremor Brothers add their own brand of wacky and violent comedic relief.I will admit, however, that the hurried wrap-up of the plot in the last was rushed and a little sloppy. It took me a couple minutes after the credits were rolling to really get what just happened. But still, even with the rushed ending, I thoroughly enjoyed Smokin Aces, and I suggest you go see it as soon as possible! Take the kids! ...wait...",Smokin' Aces
489,crazyfingers75,Don't Listen to the Nay-Sayers,8,26 January 2007,"Now, I understand that everyone has their own personal preference. But this movie gave me everything that I expected. I was not expecting an Oscar winning script, or Oscar winning directing. I was expecting a fast, brutal action movie. I got more than I expected.The action was better and way more brutal than I thought it would be. The acting was AMAZING. I have to say that Common and Alicia really surprised me, and they both did great jobs, Common especially. Ryan Reynolds really brought his acting up, along with other obvious's like Piven, Liotta, and Garcia.Also, the movie was way more emotional than I thought it would be. Not like cry your heart out emotion, but at some points, it really just gets hits you. I don't want to add spoilers, so I will just say, see the movie to understand what Im talking about.I don't know why people are comparing this movie to Tarantino Films and The Departed. Don't go into Smokin Aces thinking its anything like any Tarantino movie, or expecting the prowess of Departed.Great movie, not as fast as the previews make it seem, but still great action, good acting, some comedy.",Smokin' Aces
490,ichi-the-killer1,Cult classic - 5 stars!!!,10,28 January 2007,"From the director of Narc. Should I even say anymore? This movie is so good! You know American's have horrible taste in movies when this movie is second and Epic Movie is in first place. Epic Movie should be in 100th place, come on America grow up!!! Guns, knives, Nazis, drugs, ho's, gangsters, mafia, and a one eyed karate kid on Ritalin!!! Keep an eye on this director because he is going places. There are so many good actors in this flick. The list is HUGE! I saw this movie on the Ultra Screen and it was booming with wonderful DTS sound and the picture was swell. Do not wait for this to hit DVD, it must be viewed on the BIG screen.",Smokin' Aces
491,mikotnt,Boring aces,3,31 January 2007,"Some of you are gonna call me a LOSER or an idiot for hating this movie..But remember this first .I love Scarface,Crank,King of New York,all of Guy Ritchie movies,Quentin Tarantino movies,and this movie never got close to True Romance.the gun fire was OK,but nothing compared to the hotel room shoot out in True Romance.Best thing about this boring movie was Ryan Reynolds ,Common and Alicia Keys.too many worthless characters,who would even consider hiring a desk clerk with that much acne to greet people,give me a break.You idiots need to see some of the movies I named before you GO WOW! OVER STINKIN ACES. It's worth watching as a rental but i do want my money back from the theater.",Smokin' Aces
492,waw89,Great movie but for different reasons than you would think,10,27 January 2007,"Yes, the story is confusing, however, what makes this great is the character interaction. Its about relationships, Common and Piven, Reynolds and Liotta. Its a character movie and has messages underneath. The one word to describe this movie is balanced. Before in cinema only Tarantino had been able to balance: extreme violence, comedy, sex, and underlying messages. Joe Carnahan while maybe not as good as Tarantino in this aspect, shows promise with this entertaining flick. My only advise for those who badmouth this movie, is to see it again and try to keep up with the story, that is if you're not too stupid. Great powerful performances by Reynolds, Keys, Common, and Piven. Good Film",Smokin' Aces
493,haquinn,This movie is sweet,8,11 February 2007,"I was expecting a pretty ballsy action filck, what i got was a pretty ballsy action filck on acid. There are so many characters that get a pretty equal amount of screen time (if they don't get killed). I loved this movie, from the start right through to the end, there was nothing boring about it at all. When you have a mix from the Smokin' Hot Alicia Keys right through to the neo Nazi industrial looking Tremors how can you possibly go wrong. 2 stand out moments - Jason bateman's thanking god speech and the kid with the nunchucks. I couldn't stop laughing. This have every genre in there, Action, Thriller, Drama, Romance (it's in there if you look). This movie kicks ass!!!",Smokin' Aces
494,dawnzap,LOVE!,10,25 April 2018,"I love how y'all are calling this movie ""guy noir"" and acting like it's a movie for guys when I am all girl and this is one of my favorite movies. I just love everything about this flick. It's good fun and the cast is to die for. Y'all need to loosen up a little ;)",Smokin' Aces
495,pjbull,Mayhem and Violence at it's Best,9,9 February 2007,"The movie is violent, sure. It's about hit men, mafia and such. You take the intricate layout and twists of Ocean's Eleven and combine that with the brutal mansion destroying force from Scarface and you'll have the product that is Smoking Aces. The characters have enough depth to be intrigued and understand where they're coming from without having it draw out for hours on end. The movie wraps up character depth, action sequence and manages to throw in a few twists & surprises along the way. The names in the story are big names and lot's of recognizable faces. When there are such different factions going after one man, it's interesting to see how each new hit-man or hitwoman attempt to take out one man. From neo-Nazis to Columbian torturists to a pair of gun-toting femme fatales it's a must see.",Smokin' Aces
496,belappin,baaaadaaaasss,7,27 January 2007,"Great movie, great acting, lots of action and great plot line, better than the previews look and the previews look awesome so...definitely check this one out. Despite all the bad reviews that I saw on this movie and the low rating on this site my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unless you are morally righteous and not a fan of action/mobster films you will like it. I guess the other reviews don't like hott women, guns, violence, drugs, and booze....personally I think those are the finer things life has to offer. Every one in the film is after Buddy ""Aces"" Israel and things get really intense and exciting leading up to the final shootout.",Smokin' Aces
