0,Leofwine_draca,"Dark, brooding, violent action...top stuff, in other words",9,18 October 2016,"While the 1989 adaptation of the Marvel comic was a cheesy, action-packed, B-movie starring Dolph Lundgren, the 2004 is a big-bucks Hollywood blockbuster which stands as a great example of its kind. Instead of being clichéd and tired, THE PUNISHER kicks backside from beginning to end, charting an unlikely path between human drama, comedy and balls-to-the-wall action, and succeeding admirably. The first half-hour of the movie – which sets up the events which are to follow – is absolutely tragic, and had me reaching for the hankies on occasion; afterwards, the film turns into a dark vigilante thriller, very violent in places yet touching and funny in others. A witty script and excellent theme tune really help to add to the proceedings.Thomas Jane (who has never had his chance at the limelight before, after appearing as one-dimensional characters like the hero in DEEP BLUE SEA), is outstanding in the role, not only massively muscular, but a quality actor too. Bad guy duties go to the tag-team of Will Patton (who looks like Ron Perlman in BLADE II) as a sadist and John Travolta, overacting to the hilt and remaining utterly enjoyable, as only he can, as the family man/crime boss. Director Jonathan Hensleigh also elicits some very good roles to the supporting likes of the three actresses, Laura Harring, Rebecca Romijn, Samantha Mathis, and also Roy Scheider, who really has been away from our scenes too long. Finally, there's Ben Foster, who seems to be carving a path for himself with slightly psychotic characters, in this and HOSTAGE.Of course, this is an action flick at heart, and there are some great scenes. The climatic shoot-out, complete with bombs disguised as champagne bottles and a wicked bow and arrow, is top-notch stuff, and you've gotta love the car-dragging sequence which follows – how perfectly cinematic can you get? Meanwhile, the over-the-top (but yet so cool) battle between Jane and a hired Russian assassin is one of the most brutal and exciting I've witnessed. Also watch out for one of the most painful sequences put on film, which shows you don't need gore for effect – all I'll say is that it'll put you off piercings for life! All in all, THE PUNISHER is a dark and brooding action flick, expertly directed and with real style. Bring on the sequel.",The Punisher
1,SnoopyStyle,flat directing style revenge movie,6,13 October 2013,"In the last undercover operation of FBI agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), corrupt businessman Howard Saint's (John Travolta) son Bobby is killed. The Saints seeks revenge against Frank's family. Only Frank survives and sets out to avenge his family. He becomes The Punisher, a one man war against Howard Saint and his associates.John Travolta doesn't look old enough. It would probably be better to have an older don or a younger son. Thomas Jane is monotone acting except when he was undercover. The style is rather bland including sound and music. The directing skills involved is limited. At 2 hours long, it could use quite a bit of trimming. It does have kills. The shooting and fighting is all there. The action is real not CG. It's a good action movie with limited directing skills.",The Punisher
2,claudio_carvalho,"It is not a Vengeance, It is Punishment!",7,16 July 2005,"The undercover agent Frank Castle (Tom Jane) kills the son of the powerful mobster Howard Saint (John Travolta) in Tampa during an FBI operation. Howard orders his gangsters to execute the whole family of Frank, who is on vacation in a family reunion in Porto Rico. He miraculously survives the attack, and becomes ""The Punisher"", executing the criminals without trial.This version of ""The Punisher"" is a good action movie, supported by a great cast with names such as John Travolta, Will Patton, Tom Jane, Rebecca Romijm-Stamos, Roy Scheider, and an enjoyable story. There are some good lines, such as when Frank says: ""-It is not a vengeance, it is punishment!""; or when the man who saved Frank says to him: ""- Go with God"", and he asks to leave God out of his business. I personally prefer the Dolph Lundgren's version of 1989. The 2004 version is a higher budget film, with a constellation of stars, but the other version is darker and with more action. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Justiceiro"" (""The Vigilante"")",The Punisher
3,classicsoncall,"""God's gonna sit this one out"".",7,1 April 2016,"I watch a film like this in the same way I watch films with Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal in them; it's to see the bad guys get what's coming to them. Truthfully, I had no idea this movie even existed, I saw the Dolph Lundgren film a long time ago and can't even recall it now. Thomas Jane makes for a worthwhile anti-hero, but if there's a critique to be offered for his take on the Marvel Punisher, it's that he's too, what's the word - sanitary?, clean cut? All-American? - I don't know if I can come up with the right word but hopefully you get my drift.This is the second time within about a week I happened to catch a picture with Kevin Nash in it, he was 'The Russian' in this one and had a role as a prison guard/football player in the Adam Sandler remake of ""The Longest Yard"". So that intrigued me enough to look up his other film credits and I was surprised to see he's got over a hundred. Upon closer examination though, the majority have to do with his day job as a pro wrestler, which come to think of it, IMDb seems to recognize as another type of acting role. That should sober up some minority of folks who still think wrestling is on the up and up.Well at least this wasn't all just straightforward mindless violence and mayhem. I thought the way Frank Castle/Punisher set up Howard Saint (John Travolta) was pretty innovative; instead of coming at him head on Castle created a pretty nasty web of deceit around the man's gangster connections. The business with Livia Saint (Laura Harring) and consiglieri Quentin Glass (Will Patton) left both of them clueless as to Howard's sudden irrationality. What gets the job done I guess.As for Howard Saint himself, that was a nasty way to go wasn't it? I think I like Travolta in his villain roles more so than the Vinny Barbarino type characters. Compared to his Tony Manero in ""Saturday Night Fever"", you just had to know that going up against The Punisher would end up a disco inferno.",The Punisher
4,gavin6942,A Different take on the Punisher,6,28 January 2016,"An undercover FBI agent becomes a vigilante assassin and sets out to unleash his wrath upon the corrupt businessman who slaughtered his entire family at a reunion.The Punisher has had a rough ride in Hollywood. So far as I know, the first Punisher film was in the 1980s and is all but forgotten. Then this one came along, and is probably the best known and most successful. But apparently not successful enough to have the star (Thomas Jane) appear in the sequel, which brought in Ray Stevenson. And what is the deal with John Travolta as the bad guy? Was he still riding the wave from ""Pulp Fiction"", or maybe this was a small hump after ""Swordfish""? Anyway, what they did here was a strange departure. You have the very core of the character -- a man avenging his family -- but that is about it. The FBI agent angle is a bit lame. Sure, you can't have him be a Vietnam vet anymore, but why not Desert Storm? It will be interesting to see how well the Punisher blends in to the ""Daredevil"" TV series. I feel like that will be the best incarnation yet, and who knows... maybe we will someday get the film we deserve. Though it is not likely, since we're still recovering from an endless stream of ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Ghost Rider"".",The Punisher
5,jboothmillard,The Punisher,6,6 February 2011,"I recognised the title because of on of the leading stars, I knew it was based on the Marvel comic books, and the recognisable skull logo, I was most interested in watching. Basically Frank Castle (Deep Blue Sea's Thomas Jane) is the special agent on his final assignment, undercover in an operation, where he unintentionally kills the son of corrupt businessman (and gangster) Howard Saint (John Travolta), Bobby Saint (James Carpinello), before retiring. Wanting revenge for his son's death, Saint sends a group of hit men to go and kill not just Frank, but Saint's wife Livia (Mulholland Drive's Laura Harring) the whole Castle family, including Frank Castle Sr. (Roy Scheider), his wife Maria (Super Mario Bros. star Samantha Mathis) and his children. After the hit men failed to kill him, despite being shot and almost blown up, Frank now wants revenge himself, and he starts by moving into an apartment with three young outcast neighbours, Joan (X-Men's Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Spacker Dave (Ben Foster) and Bumpo (John Pinette). After kidnapping Mickey Duka (Eddie Jemison) he frightens him (fakely torturing him) to get information about the Saints, and Mickey admits he hates them himself, and offers to help in anyway he can as mole. Frank, with the help of his son's cool black tee-shirt with the skull, and a long black leather jacket, becomes the new vigilante against the Saints and some other thugs being judge, jury and executioner as 'The Punisher'. He knows the only way to bring them down is to make them inadvertently have their world collapse on them, so he finds out one of Howard's right hand men Quentin Glass (Will Patton) is gay, he blackmails him with revealing photos to look like he is going a hotel with Livia, having an affair. There is a point when the Saints do find where Frank is hiding, and they get The Russian (Kevin Nash) and one or two other hit men to come and kill him, and the three friends in the apartment building are willing to sacrifice themselves to protect him. Eventually Frank is ready to have Howard bring down himself and his entire empire completely, making him kill Quentin and Livia thinking they are indeed having an affair, and finally going to the Saints mansion to kill Howards's son John (also Carpinello), and of course the kingpin himself. In the end, after finally getting the revenge he wants for the death of his loved ones, Castle vows to fight against many other criminals and killers in the city so that no-one else goes through what he did. Also starring A. Russell Andrews as Jimmy Weeks. Jane makes a good dark hero, Travolta is a nasty villain, and Romijn-Stamos and Harring do their best as the female characters, there is plenty of action, chases, many explosions and quite a bit of blood, it may have some unrealistic stuff involving near-death, but it is a very watchable action crime thriller. Good!",The Punisher
6,ccthemovieman-1,A Pleasant Surprise,8,4 November 2005,"I was surprised how good this movie was, not stupid as I figured. It's another one of those based-on-a-comic book hero films that seem to be popular nowadays (Hellboy, Batman, Sin City, Spiderman, Superman, etc.) However, this was the not the cartoon-like film I expected. It was more of a pretty brutal revenge-crime movie. It's a rough movie, pure and simple.Believable? Of course not. Some of the action is ludicrous but the most ridiculous of all - the fight against the huge Russian, is actually the most fun of the action scenes. The rest is just plain mean as the hero's entire family gets wiped out by gunman and ""The Punisher"" (Thomas Jane) goes after them after almost being killed himself.A smart aspect of this film was inserting a bit of humor in it, such as the two nerds down the hallway who befriend ""The Punisher."" The sometimes-juvenile but interesting action scenes, the diverse characters in here and the humor all combine to make this better than anticipated. No, it's anything but a thinking man's movie, but it IS entertaining and harmless if you look at everything tongue-in-cheek.",The Punisher
7,rmax304823,This is murder.,3,12 September 2005,"I can't really think of who this movie is aimed at. I suppose (1) people who have been living in a tree house and have never seen an action flick from the 1980s or (2) people, whose ages I expect to be in the single digits, who love seeing people being offed in spectacular ways.I will mention one way in passing. The guy has just been stunned by an explosion and is limping away. The hero follows him and shoots him in the chest. The the guy is still alive, lying there with a hole in him, so the hero in his hoarse whisper spells out all the rotten stuff that he, the hero, has ALREADY put him, the heavy, through. ""You killed my son,"" gasps the wounded heavy. ""Both of them,"" says the hero dispassionately, ""and I made you kill your best friend and made you kill your wife."" Then he ties the dying man's legs to a remote-controlled car and sets the car rolling through a massive parking lot, dragging the heavy behind -- as if he hand't been hectored enough. Then the hero begins blowing up some of the parked cars so that from the air the fires form the shape of a mean-looking skull. The explosion blow flaming gasoline all over the place so the man being dragged behind the car catches fir and begins screaming and kicking. He finally dies.Now, I'm not familiar with the comic book these material is supposed to come from but I kind of wish it had remained in its own medium. Once in a while the script slips in a few wisecracks in a pitiful imitation of an already pitiful genre, but it's gore and the bodies slamming around, though cartoonish in their very nature, are painful to watch, unless you enjoy seeing people suffer.I wonder if I can make this clear. In ""Reservoir Dogs"" there is a scene in which Michael Madsen is left alone in a garage with a captured police officer who is tied helplessly to a chair. Madsen strolls quietly around while explaining to the bound and gagged cop that he doesn't really care about any information the cop might give him. He's going to torture him anyway. The scene generates a frisson. The audience shivers, half in disbelief, half in disgust, and half in perverted pleasure at what they're about to see. I know -- that's three halves, but I don't care. This WHOLE MOVIE is like that one awful scene in ""Reservoir Dogs."" I can't say I've seen the comic book that was the source for this material, but as a movie it reminded me a little of ""The Crow."" Or -- let's be honest -- it's not much more than any other revenge movie, only taken to excess. The heavies do something awful to the hero, and this gives the hero an excuse to wreak an awesome and merciless punishment on everyone he suspects. (This is beginning to remind me of the current international situation.) The hero is one of those taciturn bemuscled figures whom no one can outdraw. He can be outnumbered ten to one, or his adversary can be three times his size, but no matter. He always wins anyway. I forget who played the hero. John Travolta and Will Patton have become pretty good actors but there's really nothing for them to do. Throughout the movie a toothsome blond keeps trying to wean the hero off his revenge kick. ""Good memories can make the hurt go away,"" or some equally penetrating bumper sticker. At the end, when he is through slaughtering everyone and blowing up cities, the hero puts a gun to his throat. (I mean, how can anyone since Hitler live with himself?) BUT -- at the moment he's about to pull the trigger, he has a vision of his deceased wife waving good-bye and, Lo, the realization comes to him in a blinding flash that -- YES, Virginia -- Good memories CAN make the hurt, etc. He runs back to the blond who's been helping him and trying to reform him. That, at least, is a sensible act because she's cosmetically pretty sound.Want to see a good movie about taking revenge on others for doing a terrible thing? See Ingmar Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring."" But be warned, kids, it's not in color.",The Punisher
8,ma-cortes,Violent movie upon a bloody vengeance,7,30 June 2005,"The film talks on a police agent G man(Thomas Jane)called Frank Castle whose family(wife Samantha Morton and dad Roy Scheider) was wiped out by a mobsters (John Travolta,wife Laura Harring and son Ben Foster, besides Will Patton) retaliates,thus he executes an incredible revenge originating a bodycount about numerous baddies.He's helped by a freaks group (Rebeca Romijin Stamos and others). The final confrontation amongst the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and groundbreaking .In the picture there are thriller,frenetic action ,drama suspense, emotion and a little bit of blood and gore. Runtime film is adjusted about two hours and isn't bored because is fast moving but happen amount events and for that is entertained and funny. The motion picture has a certain resemblance with Charles Bronson films of the series ¨Death Wish¨for the matter, the avenging, thus one personage ,¨the vigilante¨ makes of judge,jury and executioner. The yarn is an adaptation from a Marvel Comics character created by Gary Conway.Previously was realized the first version with Dolph Lundgren and Lois Gossett JR that was a flop and attained lukewarm reception by the public . However this rendition has obtained many success in the box office in spite of the violence is extreme and some scenes are crude and cruel. The interpretation of the principal actors are nice but the secondary cast with the quirky bunch are magnificent. Cinematography by Conrad W.Hall(Son of the mythic photographer Conrad L.Hall)is excellent. The pic is well directed by Jonathan Hensleigh. Rating: Above average. Well catching",The Punisher
9,edwagreen,The Punisher is Hardly Rewarding **,5,12 November 2006,"Violent film with John Travolta and Thomas Jane starring about a smuggling job going awry and the gangster's son getting killed as a result.In their anger, the victim's parents swear to get the agent they blame for this. Unfortunately, they succeed as the latter's family is totally wiped out in graphic violence.The rest of the movie is devoted to the agent getting revenge on the family.John Travolta, as the gangster, really has little to do here. He becomes effective towards the end of this film when Thomas Jane, the agent, makes it appear that Travolta's wife is having an affair with his accountant. The film actually descends into a bloodbath in the order of Rambo.Jane, who was so effective in the Billy Crystal film dealing with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, plays a violence consumed person. Even in the end, he is now totally dedicated to destroying all forms of evil. Despite the tragedy he has endured, it's the old question: Does the end justify the means?",The Punisher
10,sunwarrior13,A Dark Film That Serves As A Guilty Pleasure,7,28 October 2011,"The Punisher is an action film that is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.It stars Thomas Jane as the antihero Frank Castle/The Punisher and John Travolta as the villain Howard Saint,a money launderer who orders the death of Castle's entire family.It also stars also stars Rebecca Romijn-Stamos,Laura Elena Harring,Roy Scheider,and Kevin ""Big Sexy"" Nash.The story of the movie involves an ordinary lawman goes outside the law to carry out his own brand of justice.It was directed by Jonathan Hensleigh.In this dark-themed action/thriller,Frank Castle is an FBI agent who deeply loves his wife and son,but is also strongly devoted to his work. Castle's investigation of a powerful crime cartel leads to a gunfight which claims the life of a young boy,whose father is underworld kingpin Howard Saint.Furious and eager for revenge, Saint arranges for Castle and his family to be murdered in retaliation. However, while Castle's wife and son are killed, he somehow survives, even though he's believed to have perished. Bent on stopping Saint once and for all, Castle remakes himself as The Punisher, a ruthless and heavily armed killing machine who will not rest until Saint and his crew have been wiped clean from the Earth. The Punisher is a dark film that tries to present itself as a guilty pleasure.Unfortunately,the movie isn't engaging but a motion of exercise. The talented cast fails to elevate this violent and revenge flick.The ideas in the movie are not refreshing nor original as most of the elements contained in it were borrowed from other film features.Aside from that,the special effects are somewhat lacks style and were never astounding.Overall,The Punisher is nothing more than an action entertainment.",The Punisher
11,Theo Robertson,Mean Revenge Thriller,6,9 September 2013,"This is supposedly based on a comic book series . Having no knowledge or interest in the source material I can only judge THE PUNISHER on its own merits having never even seen the original 1989 film based upon the strip . I do hold a rather morbid interest in vigilante /revenge thrillers and one problem with these type of stories is bringing something new to the sub-genre In its favour THE PUNISHER ups the ante . It's not enough for John Travolta's bad ass bad guy Howard Saint to take out his revenge on FBI good guy Frank Castle , he has to wipe out his entire family before killing Frank and almost succeeds in his mission . It's rather nasty the way the mafia hit team coldly and clinically wipe out a family get together . What happened to the good old fashioned mafia manta of "" It's business , we keep to our own , we don't hurt women and kids etc "" . This sequence alone makes the film slightly more darker and mean spirited than the usual fare . After this the film becomes fairly routine with Franky boy hunting down the scum who killed his family . One can't help noticing however this might have influenced Christopher Nolan's reboot of the BATMAN franchise however",The Punisher
12,jotix100,Comic book relief,6,5 July 2005,"""The Punisher"" which surprisingly didn't last too long in its original release, was shown recently on cable. Not having seen it, we decided to take a chance. We had no idea about what to expect, the film is typical of the comic book genre. We find a hero that seems to be made of rubber because he can take whatever punishment is thrown at him and come out of it much better than before. Jonathan Hensleigh directed the film.Frank Castle, the former FBI man, is the target of Howard Saint, who has a vendetta because of the death of one of his sons at the hands of Castle. Saint, a nasty character, goaded by his wife, orders the elimination of Castle and his whole family. The occasion presents itself when Castle is having a family reunion in Puerto Rico. Saint's men track them down and eliminate everyone in the family, but of course, little do they know that Castle, who seems to have more lives than a cat, survives.The rest of the film is predictable and it relies totally on special effects to make up for a lack of ideas. The film is full of clichés, as we have seen all of this before.The main problem with the film is Thomas Jane, who as Castle, plays the role with a stone face that never changes after the loss of his family. John Travolta plays the bad Howard Saint. Will Patton has some great moments as Saint's right hand man.",The Punisher
13,preppy-3,"Bleak, depressing and sadistic",6,18 April 2004,"Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an FBI undercover man about to retire with his wife and kid.  During his last job the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), a powerful, rich crime lord is shot and killed.  Saint orders Castle killed and his evil bitchy wife orders the whole family killed!  The orders are carried out yet Castle survives (after being punched senseless AND being shot point blank in the chest!).  He sets out to avenge his family.Based on the Marvel comic book character this IS true to the spirit of the comic--very grim and dark.  It also ups the violence and adds some real sick sadism to it.  And it takes itself VERY seriously.  What you're left with is a very dark movie with not even a little humor to lighten the mood.  They do add an obese man, an overly pierced man (for unfunny comic relief) and a waitress (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos has NOTHING to do) but they're just annoyances and serve only as victims.  Also, Castle is beaten up multiple times, shot at, tortured yet is always fine.  The guy isn't even super human yet he survives beatings that would kill any man.  It throws credibility out the window and it gets kind of sick--it seems the filmmakers enjoy torturing this poor guy.The acting isn't bad.  Jane is actually very good in the title role.  His dyed black hair takes some getting used to (he's a blond in real life) but it works.  Travolta nicely underplays the role of the main villain. Everybody else is just there to be victims or menaced.  And it IS nice to see Roy Scheider again--although he's killed off almost immediately.So, it's true to its source but way too dark and needlessly violent.  I'm giving it a 6 though.  I was never bored and Jane WAS good.",The Punisher
14,LeonLouisRicci,Only The Punisher CAN Bring a Knife to a Gun Fight,9,1 September 2014,"Underrated, Violent, and Grim, this R-Rated Marvel Comics Movie is Fairly Accurate in Tone to the Comic Books that have been Around Since 1974 when the Character Debuted in the Amazing Spider-Man Book.The Punisher Became a Relentless Vigilante with Little Remorse and Used Stylized Ultra-Violence as His MO. In this Movie Thomas Jane Manages to Brood with Believability and is Stone-Faced Serious, just Like His Comic-Book Persona.The Film may be a Tad Too Long with John Travolta's Villainous Character and Assorted Sub-Plots, but it doesn't Manage to Detract from the Power of the Revenge Story and the Part with the Neighbors, Highlighted by Ben Foster's Gen-X Slacker. This and a Few Other Satiric Highlights do Lighten the Film just a Bit, Like the Hired Killer from Memphis.There are Other Outstanding Scenes like the Hard-Nosed Fight with the Russian, and the Ending as The Punisher is just Nasty and Brutal in a Movie that is Brutal from the Beginning.Fans of the Comic will Most Likely Like it as will Action Movie Junkies that Appreciate R-Rated Comic Book Movies that Don't Hold Back.Note...If you liked this there is a follow up Movie, Punisher War Zone (2008) that is even More Violent and is an Over the Top Treat for Frank Castle Fans.Note 2...The First Appearance of The Punisher in Film was done in (1989) starring Dolph Lundgren. An Ultra-Low Budget Affair that didn't have a clue. The Producers didn't even bother to have Him wear the Trademark skull logo. Unforgivable.",The Punisher
15,poolandrews,"Nothing special, I prefer the Lundgren version from the late 80's.",5,21 August 2007,"The Punisher starts as an illegal arms deal goes bad & Bobby Saint (James Carpinello) is shot dead by Federal Agents, it was all a set-up & poor old Bobby has ended up in a body bag because of it. The operation was set up by FBI agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) & Bobby happens to the son of a powerful & wealthy underworld banker named Howard Saint (John Travolta) & when Howard learns of Castle he orders his men to kill Castle & his entire family. Howard's men manage to kill Castle's family but not Frank himself who decides to become a vigilante & go it alone in order to punish those responsible for the brutal slaying of his entire family, it's a long dark, bloody & death filled road but it's one Frank is determined to walk down in pursuit of justice...This American German co-production was co-written & directed by Jonathan Hensleigh who manages to turn in a film that is strictly average, it should be noted that since the theatrical version was released an extended by 20 odd minutes cut has been released on DVD & I will be basing my comments on the shorter theatrical cut as I haven't seen the extended one. The script by Hensleigh & Michael France is based on the Marvel comic book character & strangely doesn't feel like a comic book film at all, the Punisher as a character has no superpowers like say Spider-Man or Superman & even the action scenes are relatively low & disappointingly un-comic book like. I was hoping for huge over-the-top set-pieces & action scenes which never came, as a whole The Punisher feels very much like a routine 'one man army on a revenge mission' action thriller of which there are countless examples out there. The only distinguishing feature of the Punisher himself is his skull motif on his shirt & that's it. The film is utterly predictable as well with the viewer knowing from the first frame that Castle will kill all the bad guy's & avenge his dead family. The character's aren't great, the three comedy relief teenagers who live near Castle feel out of place, Howard Saint is given no background & Castle himself just doesn't seem that cut up about his family.Director Hensleigh does alright but there's nothing particularly special in The Punisher, the action scenes are well choreographed & there's plenty of blood & dead bodies flying around but there's no 'big' comic book action scenes here & apart from one or two cool looking guns, a bow & arrow & a butterfly knife the weaponry is also rather dull & routine looking. I personally think The Punisher (1988) staring Dolph Lundgren is far superior to this, despite the lower budget the action scenes are better, it's better paced & less boring, the villains are better, the weaponry from ninja throwing stars to samurai swords to sawn off shotguns to deadly razor sharp earrings are much more fun & feels much more like a comic book as is the film as a whole. In fact I can't think of one aspect of the new Punisher that I liked more than the Lundgren one, I even preferred his beat up old motorbike he drives around on rather than the car he has in this. The violence isn't that excessive, there's plenty of dead bodies, someone gets a knife stuck under their chin & someone gets an arrow through their neck.I was a bit surprised to learn that The Punisher only had a budget of about $15,500,000 which isn't a lot of money, in fact until recently Steven Seagal's straight-to-video efforts have had higher budgets. Shot in Florida this is well made but not particularly stylish & the only time it tries to be when an explosion caused by the Punisher causes flames in the shape of his skull motif just look silly. The acting is OK, I'm not sure what Travolta is doing in this & I'm not sure how much he was paid as for his previous film Basic (2003) & one of his next Ladder 49 (2004) he was paid $20,000,000 each which is more than the entire budget for The Punisher!The Punisher is a bit of a disappointment, this could have been a entertaining & ultra violent action flick with a cool comic book feel but instead it feels like a standard average budget revenge flick. Watch the '88 Punisher instead as it's a better film in every respect in my opinion. The sequel The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank (2008) has been made & will be out soon, probably straight-to-video.",The Punisher
16,dbborroughs,"Hey, This is Pretty Good",8,7 May 2004,"Up until the commercials that ran a couple of days before the opening everything I was seeing of or on this version of the Punisher made me think this was going to be horrible. Still not wanting to waste my cash I waited and then when two key opinions said it was a good film I decided to try it.And despite all my misgivings I have to say that this is a very good film.Is it the Punisher?Occasionally. There are times when it has the gritty sense of violence that the comic had. Unfortunately at others it has a humor that doesn't quite work with the explosions of violence. Its not bad, it just comes across as the film not knowing if its real or not. A case in point the battle with the Russian that leads into the torture of David. There are also key problems with the adaptation in that too much of the back-story is removed (Castle, at least early on, was suppose to be dead to the world, here everyone knows he's still alive---and easy to find)I freely admit I was wrong about this film and while I think its a good film (8 out of 10) I will withhold saying that its a real version of the Punisher.",The Punisher
17,zardoz-13,An Imaginative But Gritty Marvel Action Movie . . .,9,6 December 2008,"The second Marvel Comics movie about their anti-heroic character ""The Punisher"" resembles those popular Charles Bronson vigilante thrillers from the 1970s. This straightforward, old-fashioned, formulaic, but suspenseful revenge epic looks incredibly realistic compared to most Hollywood pulp blown far out of proportion with special effect ad nauseam. You know the kind of movie that I am talking about, blood squibs explode like tomatoes, bullets fly in lead swarms, and life has no value. Director Jonathan Hensleigh stated on the commentary track of ""The Punisher"" DVD that the works of Sam Peckinpah, Don Siegel, and Sergio Leone inspired him. People perish by the dozens but you don't see a lot of gore so he must have been channeling more of Leone and Siegel than bloody ole Sam.Indeed, ""The Punisher"" so singles out its objectives that anything beyond the hero's grim retribution appears disposable. The supporting cast in the apartment section of the film gives the story most of its heart that its vengeful, hard-drinking, stoic hero cannot. Nevertheless, ""The Punisher"" ripples with considerable imagination for a hardcore, balls-to-the-wall actioneer. Our obsessive champion lives only to savor the moments when he can settle a score in blood and he can see no farther than the next target on his hit-list. After he wipes out the opposition, Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) thrusts a gun down his gullet. Without his wife and young son, Frank finds no meaning in life.Happily, ""GoldenEye"" scribe Michael France and writer-turned-helmer Jonathan Hensleigh have loaded a lot of wit into this otherwise nondescript, down-to-earth, kill or be killed payback yarn. Delete the distinctive white skull T-shirt scene and then tone down the violence, and you'd never guess that this shoot'em up was based on the thirty year Marvel Comic protagonist who appeared initially in 1974 as a ""Spider-man"" nemesis. Again, Hensleigh has noted that the movie is based closely on the Garth Ennis ""Punisher"" from 2001. The Dolph Lundgren ""Punisher"" ignored the protagonist's ""Spider-man"" origins, too.Conversely, ""The Punisher"" doesn't drum up those anti-social sentiments. Hensleigh shows a lot of shooting, stabbing, and killing, but he doesn't celebrate the hero's violence behavior. ""The Punisher"" shows the consequences of violence. Death and killing alter both people and events. Second string tough guy Thomas Jane, so wonderful in ""Stander,"" makes his bid for the big-screen as the eponymous character and succeeds for my money. Jane spends the bulk of ""The Punisher"" baring his Bo-Flex physique when he isn't braving a gauntlet of obstacles that would stagger ordinary mortals.The major complication is that one of Saint's sons; Bobby (newcomer James Carpinello in a dual role) has decided to cut himself in on one of his soldier's deals and accompanies him to the buy. Unfortunately, poor Bobby Saint takes one for the team during a shoot-out after the authorities stage the bogus death of one of their undercover operatives. Predictably, Howard Saint is not amused. Saint's trophy wife Livia (Hispanic actress Laura Harring of ""John Q"") demands retribution. Eventually, Saint's resourceful, right-hand minion, Quentin Glass (the vastly underrated Will Patton of ""The Rapture"") learns that Saint's son died in an FBI sting. In no time, Saint sends Glass and an army of gunsels to annihilate the Castle clan, including Frank's father, Frank the Elder, (Roy Schneider of ""The French Connection"" and ""Jaws.""), during a family reunion. Ironically, Frank had no idea who died on the docks the night of his sting or that his old FBI buddy with a gambling debt sold him out. Glass' thugs run down Frank's wife (Samantha Mathis of ""Broken Arrow"") and his young son Will (first-time actor Marcus Johnson) as they flee the family reunion in a futile gesture. Bobby's vengeful brother delivers the last rites to Frank on the dock, but you cannot kill an action hero. Frank survives under mysterious circumstances that defy logic. Nevertheless, the hero is so miserable that his only consolation flows from a bottle of Wild Turkey.Along the way, Frank establishes his headquarters in a remote apartment complex where three other tenants abide; Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos of ""X-Men""), Dave (Ben Foster), and Mr.Bumpo (John Pinette.). When Saint's killers visit Frank, anybody else would have called the landlord and demanded his eviction. Instead, this try to help our hero, and they pay for their interference. You'll spot the ""Othello"" homage when our wily hero turns Saint against Livia and his second-in-command. A bone-jarring, close-quarters combat scene erupts between Frank and another assassin. Frank's assailant is a Russian about three times bigger who nearly destroys not only him but also the apartment complex.As the chief villain, ""Pulp Fiction"" star John Travolta is incredibly creepy in a restrained performance as Rome emperor-like mobster Howard Saint, and Travolta's death scene alone justifies watching this gritty movie. As the hero's sworn enemy, Travolta isn't afraid of getting faux blood on himself. He establishes his villainous credentials from the start when he personally executes a wayward mobster minion involved in the death of his son. Incidentally, Travolta's death scene provides the movie with its signature money shot. Not only is it by far the most over-the-top scene, but it also is truly unforgettable. (Mind you, there are other great scene, for instance, the Popsicle and steak interrogation scene is probably the most memorable.Hardcore ""Punisher"" fans may quibble about some of the alterations in the comic book's transition from page to screen. Our redoubtable hero Frank Castle is working undercover for the FBI where we first meet him in Tampa, Florida. An FBI agent rather than a U.S. Marine (watch the extended version), Castle poses as a ""Stander"" type Euro arms dealer selling contraband weapons to a small fry Mafia solder, Mickey Duka (Eddie Jemison), an errand boy for notorious Saint crime family. Altogether, ""The Punisher"" doesn't look like a comic book movie with its R-rating, but Thomas Jane cuts quite a figure as the merciless but anti-heroic protagonist.",The Punisher
18,Boba_Fett1138,Brutal action flick.,7,13 May 2006,"This is a very straight forward action flick with lots of violence and tough characters. Fans of the action genre will most definitely not be disappointed by this movie.From the start on, you know that this movie is a violent one that doesn't hold back. After we've seen the entire family of Frank Castle being killed (and I mean every single last family member, both young and old) you know that this movie is going to be different from most other action movies. It's a movie that is very straight forward and doesn't hold back but at the very same time it doesn't try to force, or go too much over-the-top. I think this is most probably thanks to the directing skills of Jonathan Hensleigh and the talented cast that was involved with this movie that makes it a very enjoyable, cool and still somewhat credible, summer-action-flick.The story is basically very simple and is set around one very simple good old fashioned concept; vengeance, or maybe even better said; punishment. It's not really a sort of action movie that needs much story. The characters, both the main 'hero' and the main villain are interesting enough to carry the entire movie and make it a very pleasant one to watch. Even though the main 'hero' is pretty dark and brutal himself, you still root for him because you understand him.Thomas Jane is pretty good as the leading man and he proves that he is a great and perhaps somewhat underrated action movie star. It's always a pleasure to see John Travolta in a villainous role and he certainly also does not disappoint in this movie. Same goes for Will Patton, who also was really great in this movie (he's beginning to look old and fat now by the way.). Roy Scheider also shows up in a small role, or better said cameo as Frank Castle Sr. Kevin Nash plays a pretty cool role as a Russian hit-man. The fight sequence between him and the main character was one of the highlights of the movie to me.But seriously, were all those sequence's with the Punisher's neighbors really necessary? I understand that they were put in the movie to still give the main character an humane and more soft side but the sequences just didn't worked out good enough and perhaps only were distracting from the main plot line. The sequences also are really a waste of Rebecca Romijn's qualities. She doesn't get to do anything good or interesting in the movie. Why did she even agreed to be in this?It's nothing too memorable all and the action and story themselves are nothing more than average but it's the straight-forwardness of the movie that makes me regard this one as an above average one, that has more to offer than the average, simple action flick. The style of the movie also ain't bad and hopefully we'll hear more from director Jonathan Hensleigh (who already is a successful writer of many well known action movies) in the future.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Punisher
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Better than I expected, and that says a lot",7,23 February 2005,"Watching this movie after waiting for the chance to do so for so long, I was more than a little excited to see it. I have read The Punisher comic books for a few years, and have loved him ever since I first read a story with him. My favorite story of his would have to be the Welcome Back, Frank series, so I was naturally thrilled when I found out that this movie was so heavily based on it. I've watched the trailers so many times that I can repeat all the lines and I've read everything I could find about the film. Clearly, I was looking very much forward to seeing it, and I expected quite a bit from it. Amazingly, it surpassed my expectations and proved to be far better than I could have ever imagined. The plot is great. It's a mix of various The Punisher story lines, mainly derived from Welcome Back, Frank coupled with some new, original stuff(I think... I haven't read all the comics). The pacing is solid and the film takes off pretty much instantly. The direction is clearly inspired by Sergio Leone and westerns in general, which only elevates it even more. The film stays in the viewers mind for much longer than the recent action-flicks that seem to appeal mostly to teenagers with low attention spans(Van Helsing, Blade: Trinity). The acting is mostly good, in a few cases great, and in one or two cases bad. Thomas Jane is The Punisher. I don't mean he plays him well, I'm not saying that he brings the character alive, I'm saying he is him, he becomes him. I haven't seen the Dolph Lundgren version of the film, but I'm willing to bet an astounding sum of money that it's nowhere as good as this film. I can't see Dolph as Frank Castle. I just can't. He has the muscle, but he hasn't got the brain or the charisma. Mark Collie makes a great Harry Heck(though he wasn't a big character in the comics). Kevin Nash was a great choice for The Russian, though he didn't really have to do much acting... but his fighting was excellent. Ben Foster makes a credible Spacker Dave. John Pinette made an OK Mr. Bumpo. I didn't entirely buy Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Joan, though. She was too sexy and sensual to be Mousy Joan(who was a fragile, nervous, tender girl in the comic). Some of the villains and minor characters are slightly over- or underplayed, but it didn't really bring the movie down, I think. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The action is intense and brutal. Very brutal. Perfect for The Punisher. I won't tell you what exactly you'll see in this film, because it would be a sin to ruin the surprise for any of the fans. Suffice to say, if you like the violence in the comics, you'll enjoy the action scenes. Without a doubt. The whole things is a treat for any fan of The Punisher... the one-liners, the humor, the action... all perfect in style and mood. Now, up until now, I've praised this movie, and you might be wondering why I didn't rate it higher than I did. But here comes the one negative thing about the film; the budget was clearly not big enough for the film and for what the director wanted, and it shows. It will definitely discourage some from seeing the film that the action doesn't have enough cuts and isn't always as intense as it should be, not to mention how much of the action just screams ""we didn't have enough money to do this properly, but here it is anyway"". I have a philosophy on things like that... ""if you can't do it right, don't do it at all"". Unfortunately, the director was either stubborn or just didn't care, so he didn't do anything to really hide this. The scenes are presented as if they look exactly like they are supposed to, which really takes the viewer out of the illusion, makes it seem less real. It felt like El Mariachi, only with better actors and without the tight editing that made Robert Rodriguez' low-budget action flick work. Keep in mind, this is the only complaint I have, and it doesn't make the film unwatchable, not by a long shot. It might make you want to watch it less times than you typically would an action piece like this, though. All in all, definitely worth watching if you're into vigilante/revenge films. I recommend it to fans of The Punisher comics, particularly the Welcome Back, Frank series as well as anyone who enjoys a solid action film and/or a vigilante flick, not to mention a good western. An unusually realistic comic book movie, and definitely one of the better of the bunch. 7/10",The Punisher
20,view_and_review,Comic Book Hero Overload,3,2 January 2005,"I think Marvel Comics main guy Stan Lee should put the brakes on making movies out of so many comic book characters. We've had Spiderman, The Hulk, Daredevil, X-men, Blade, and of all of them, Punisher is the only one I stopped watching midway.This is the classic tale of vengeance, ala sooooo many movies before this one. So if you are going to be unoriginal with the plot, you better be very creative with the dialog and the special effects. Well, you won't get any of that. The Punisher is a mediocre hero at best with no special abilities besides being able to luckily survive being killed, and after a while you begin to wonder if it's good luck or bad.The Punisher can't compete; all of the other comic book characters have more to offer. Even Batman (although DC comics) has a terrific costume and plenty of gadgets. The Punisher has NO disguise/costume and NO special gadgets, not even particularly good fighting skills. It's just weak. Someone tell me how it ends, although I'm sure I can guess.",The Punisher
21,neil-476,Entertaining,8,20 October 2018,"After Frank Castle's family are slaughtered by vengeful crime lord Howard Saint, and Castle himself is left for dead, he plots revenge, or possibly suicide, while drinking heavily in a seedy rooming house in the company of several lame ducks.This film is partially adapted from the Garth Ennis/Steve Dillon Punisher comic Welcome Back Frank, and is done very well. Essentially a dark revenge story, Castle is a tragic character, well played by Thomas Jane. Yet Ennis' sly black humour is alse here, particularly in the form of Ben Foster's Spacker Dave, an apparently worthless character who acquires an awareness of his own worth during the film.John Travolta is vile as Saint, and thoroughly merits being punished.This is on of the better pre-MCU movies.",The Punisher
22,anaconda-40658,Watching This Film is Punishment Enough.,1,3 June 2015,"The Punisher (2004): Dir: Jonathan Hensleigh / Cast: Thomas Jane, John Travolta, Laura Elena Harring, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Will Patton: Viewing this dreadful garbage is punishment enough. It is a film about those sins that go undetected and the justice sought but unlike the Kill Bill films, which broadens character, it acts like an applause to revenge. Thomas Jane plays an undercover cop whose operation ended with the death of the son of a mob boss. In retaliation Jane's family is murdered by henchmen leaving him for dead. When he survives he seeks revenge. Ugly film presents one brutal act after another until revenge is achieved. Director Jonathan Hensleigh rushes his shots and the production is lousy. Jane is unsympathetic and we never care for the carnage he reacts too. John Travolta is miscast as the mob boss and when he gets his just desserts, it is never satisfying. Laura Elena Harring plays Travolta's prized wife who also meets a nasty end. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos plays a waitress. She is basically the good girl who takes him in and will be better off, despite being in this crap film. Will Patton is basically a heavy arm whose purpose here is to get into a bully physical confrontation with the Punisher and get his ass handed to him. Rather than address revenge it is exploited for the sake of entertainment. This film should be punished with several blows of a baseball bat. Score: 1 / 10",The Punisher
23,AaronCapenBanner,Remade Adaptation.,5,25 August 2013,"Thomas Jane takes over the role originated by Dolph Lundgren, in this new version of the Comic Book favorite as Frank Castle, whose family is wiped out in retaliation by a ruthless gangster(John Travolta), and who is left for dead, but survives to embark on a campaign of revenge against organized crime, taking on the familiar mantle of the death's head as his symbol.Quite stylish and energetic, and Thomas Jane is very effective and well cast, but it is a shame that this film goes on far too long, with too many characters, subplots, and strange touches(singing assassins, friendly neighbors, etc.) Still, it does have a satisfying climax and closing scene, it just falls short in my view, though the potential for greatness was there...",The Punisher
24,FlashCallahan,We have more guns.....,6,13 September 2012,"Frank Castle is a man who has seen too much death. On his final assignment, Castle plays his undercover role perfectly, but the operation spins out of control and a young man, Bobby Saint, is inadvertently killed.Inflamed by the death of their son, the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance.Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true, as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion.But Castle, to his everlasting torment, survives. Until this moment, he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law. However, experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalise the people who murdered his family.Drawing upon all he has learnt in twenty years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers....Although in many ways it's better than the Lundgren version, this version does tend to drag a little. And when it drags is the most important part of the movie, the first act.I really don't feel that we need half an hour of bonding and pouting before the execution of his family. We know they are going to die, so why not reduce it to around fifteen minutes before we get to see the titular hero? Other than that, it's one hell of a ride. Jane is fantastic as the lead, and Travolta is doing his Face/Off schtick right down to a tee.A lot of the support gets way laid a little, and the comic relief feels a little too forced, but otherwise it's probably the most faithful version of the Punisher yet, and a lot more satisfying than War Zone.It's just a shame about the saggy beginning.",The Punisher
25,movieman_kev,"We can rebuild it, make it stronger",10,16 April 2004,"Being an avid reader of ""Punisher"", I was waiting to see this film for quite some time. Opting to see it over going to the second half of ""Kill Bill"" (which I'll wait for video as I don't like being out 15 bucks to see ONE film, but that's a story for a different day). Thomas Jane does do a pretty good job at playing Frank Castle (an ex-FBI agent who is out for revenge when everyone of his relatives die),. MUCH better then Dolph. And Travolta wasn't THAT hammy, but having such high expectations, I couldn't help but be let down a bit. Now, I'm not one of those nuts who whine when any little thing is changed from the comic book character & Frank's background being different didn't bother me. I was off-put by Castle's wisecracks, some of them cringe worthy. The sequel still holds big possibility, and I'd still implore you to see this one, so another one can be made. Just don't expect anything more than a slightly above average action flick & you'll be fine. I DID love the fight with the Russian though and it's easily the highlight of the film.My Action Movie Grade: B-",The Punisher
26,Aaron1375,"Better than Dolph's 89 version, but still could have been better.",8,29 April 2004,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie quite a lot.  However, it was not without its flaws.  It doesn't follow the comic to much, but that is forgivable as is the fact they totally changed the Punisher's history.  Still, this movie just needed something else.  Maybe a bit more action or something to that effect as the movie builds up to one heck of a conclusion.  Though the fact that it builds up to a very good conclusion is more of a strength rather than a weakness.  I thought Thomas Jane and Travolta were both good and it was nice seeing Roy in a movie again.  This was also not a movie that was loaded with a lot of cgi as most of the action looked like it was actually staged unlike a lot of other action movies these days.  So I just can not place my finger on what it needed other than a different release date.  This movie should have stayed clear of Kill Bill and opened in the summer or fall.  I do not care to ever see Kill Bill, but it is a sequel so most of the Punisher's audience wanted to see how it turned out which is understandable.  This movie was a good movie, a bit of a throwback to a time before computers and well worth the time spent watching it.",The Punisher
27,Wuchakk,"Odd rendering of Marvel's The Punisher, but not bad",6,16 April 2015,"Ever since The Punisher appeared in the Spider-Man comic and, later, Daredevil, I've been a huge fan. I continued to follow the character through his first mini-series and then his own titles, The Punisher, The Punisher War Journal and The Punisher War Zone. The character was so popular at the time that he inspired a black & white magazine as well. The first movie version was 1989's ""The Punisher"" with Dolph Lundgren, which was a disappointment. Lundgren was good, but the movie was too Grade B cartoony and it took too many liberties.The reason The Punisher was and continues to be so popular is because he's essentially ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Deathwish"" over-the-top: Frank Castle's family is killed while on a picnic in Central Park due to the crossfire of rival mob gangs and Castle declares war on all criminals wherein he becomes their judge, jury and executioner. Unlike Daredevil, a lawyer who utilizes the justice system, The Punisher just kills 'em all.This 2004 movie with Thomas Jane in the eponymous role transfers the location of the character from New York City to sunny Florida, specifically the Tampa area. While this is an odd change from the comics it's an acceptable deviation because the origin of the character is basically the same, except they upped the ante by having Castle's entire extended family murdered.There are other oddities, like the inclusion of a misfit non-family at the apartment complex where The Punisher takes up residence. I think these three bizarro characters came from one of the later comics, but – while likable – I would've preferred to see Microchip, The Punisher's computer-whiz assistant.In addition, the tone and flow of the movie is odd for a superhero flick. Some quirky aspects work, like the out-of-nowhere folk minstrel who's also an assassin, played by the Johnny Cash-like Mark Collie. The song he plays, ""In Time,"" is great. Unfortunately, the character's screen time is limited to like seven minutes! The lame comic booky Russian is given about the same screen time, but at least the sequence is action-packed. John Travolta as the villain, Howard Saint, is pretty good, but I would've preferred a villain from the comics. Saint's pretty-boy son seems miscast, but I guess there are pretty boy mobsters. Other aspects don't work, like Quentin Glass' overlong interrogation of two of the misfits, which struck me as marking time.On a positive note, Jane is excellent as The Punisher with his bad-axx vibe and deep voice; it's just too bad the movie he got strapped with is so uneven, quirky and deviant from the excellent source material. I also don't think Castle's heavy drinking fits the character as The Punisher is too professional in his mission to waste time sitting around drinking away his sorrows, but this may have simply been an element of his origin and not meant for later films, which never surfaced (except for the 2012 10-minute short film ""The Punisher: Dirty Laundry."" Check it out on youtube). Thankfully, the real Punisher emerges in the final 20 minutes. If the movie had more of this it would've been better IMHO.On the female front you have Samantha Mathis as Castle's wife, Rebecca Romijn as one of the misfits and Laura Harring as the wife of Travolta's character. Mathis is underutilized while Romijn is sweet and pretty, but she strangely never tripped my trigger. Harring is great but, again, not enough is done with her.The bottom line is that this version of ""The Punisher"" is a mish-mash of good, meh and odd qualities and so the end result is somewhat mediocre, but it's still worthwhile if you're a fan of the character or you like kill-the-thug type movies such as the Dirty Harry and Deathwish franchises.The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in Tampa and St. Petersburg, Florida.GRADE: B-",The Punisher
28,The_Void,"Not great, but fun enough",6,6 November 2005,"You just don't go into The Punisher expecting to see anything like a great film, and it's a good thing because a great film this ain't. However, you can go in expecting some brainless fun; and, living up to expectations again, the film definitely delivers on that front. Pretty much every Marvel comic book had been adapted already by 2004, and I'm guessing that 'The Punisher' was one of the few comic strips left. This one is different from the rest of the comic stories, however, because the central figure doesn't actually have any superpowers. The story has it's roots in film noir and the classic revenge thrillers, and it sees government agent Frank Castle on the warpath after a gangster whose son he killed takes it upon himself to violently dispatch his family in revenge. As Castle explains, the law is flawed and in order to expose those flaws, sometimes the law needs to be taken into your own hands. Cue lots of fight scenes, explosions, car chases and cheesy banter as Castle, now calling himself 'The Punisher' takes grisly revenge on those who destroyed his life! I've never seen the original film version of this story, but I'm pretty sure it's not very good just because Dolph Lundgren is in it. This film relies more on Thomas Jane's impressive form than acting abilities; but that's no bad thing, as he really does look the part and does a good job in carrying the film. Much of the dialogue is the same trite, silly stuff that you would expect from this sort of film; but on one hand, that's actually not a bad thing. It has become customary these days for films to try and avoid clichés; and this is getting to the point where it's a cliché not to have any clichés, so seeing a true to style, cliché-ridden action thrill ride is sort of refreshing in an odd kind of way. John Travolta provides the movie with an ample amount of 'bad guy' as the sleazy gangster responsible for killing Frank Castle's family. Travolta has a dark side that should really be tapped into more often, and while his performance here is hardly great; it's good enough considering the material, and hints, as ever, that the actor probably has more ability than he's showing on screen. Overall, The Punisher isn't a great film. It's not going to change cinematic history and, to be frank, is probably going to be forgotten soon - but I enjoyed it, and most fans of comic to film adaptations will too.",The Punisher

My wife liked it, but this film is not for children. I found the build up took too long.  The first 10 minutes were great, but the movie's build up gave little room for character development.  I do not know if the director intended on the viewer knowing little about the Punisher, but I wish the director gave us more.  It has good action sequences.

Mostly, this is just a really long two hours. There are explosions, bullet hits and brutal beatdowns, oh sure, but it's shocking how afraid the filmmakers are to go to Frank Castle lengths. He's Charles Bronson in four colors, but I've seen more sickening violence on TV (and that was back then, not now).This is the Punisher. Think Batman without a moral compass. All I know of this character is what I read during Garth Ennis' run in the early 2000s (from which this draws heavily). So it's not like I've got fanboy levels of hard-to-please.

Now it is Frank's turn for vengeance, as he shakes off his grief and methodically plans the elimination of all those responsible for his tragedy.""The Punisher"" brings absolutely nothing new or original to this tired old rehash of ""Death Wish,"" especially when compared to Quentin Tarantino's fresh and stylish take on the subject in the recent ""Kill Bill"" films. Although some of Frank's score-settling is clever and even mildly amusing at times, the film itself is overlong, derivative and very poorly acted, with Thomas Jane sleepwalking through the part of Frank and John Travolta looking like he'd rather be anywhere else than doing his umpteenth version of a one-dimensional clench-jawed villain. The film also has more unpleasant scenes than one is accustomed to in run-of-the-mill action movies, starting with the cold-blooded murder of a terrified young boy.Come to think of it, from the audience's viewpoint, ""The Punisher"" is a pretty apt title for this movie.",The Punisher

37,Robert_duder,Perhaps amazing but shouldn't be The Punisher,8,8 March 2005,"Don't worry...I'm not a comics fanatic...I'm not gonna sit here and discuss why this movie didn't match the comic book, or how Frank Castle would never do this or that because of Issue 179, Part 4, series 2. In fact I'm not sure I've ever even read a Punisher Comic Book but nonetheless I do know the story and the characters and a little about it and when doing a film such as this you don't have to please the comic crowd or satisfy what everyone knows about the character but it also doesn't hurt to not stray too far from the common perceptions of the Characters. I think that's what made Spiderman so enormously popular was they didn't stray too far from what the average person already knew about Spiderman.The Punisher is the story of former undercover cop Frank Castle. He's done his last job and is now taking his son and wife away from the world of crime fighting. On Castle's last mission, the SWAT team inadvertently shot a young man who turns out to be the son of master crime lord Howard Saint. Saint, mad furious tracks down Castle, and at his wife's request sets out to murder not only his wife and son but Castle's entire family. Castle has flown his family to a Castle family reunion in the Caribbean and Saint's henchman track them down and murder everyone...including Castle after he watches his family die. But Castle doesn't die, he is nursed to health by an Island man and returns to the U.S. hellbent on revenge against Saint and his mob. Despite Saint's constant attempts to get rid of Castle for good, Castle will stop at nothing to get vengeance.The storyline is there and the action is full blown. The setting is gritty and gory although not as gory as I might have expected. If this film had been called anything else but The Punisher and kind of had it's own little story it would have been amazing. But the whole time I was looking for The Punisher. They lost out on portraying Frank Castle as a man completely mad with vengeance. The Punisher is not someone who wants a little play time because his family was wiped out, The Punisher is gone...he's over the edge, he's insane with anger and this Frank Castle didn't have that. Sure he had a melancholy, dark side and was very broody but he still have the razor sharp edge they could have given him. I didn't get the vibe of him being blood thirsty for criminals. Tom Jane definitely pulls off his role as the leading action actor and this will probably open a lot of doors for him. He does a great job and looks the part. He does some great stunts and the action is just non stop. The supporting cast does well, including (surprisingly) John Travolta as the bad guy. Not that I don't like Travolta but I had my doubts about him in this film and I thought he was perhaps too big of a screen presence to go with this film but I was way off. He was a great bad guy, and was completely crazy!!! They've gotta bring him back for a sequel. No matter how you feel about The Punisher, this film won't disappoint as an action flick and I would be all for future sequels. Great flick!! 8/10",The Punisher
38,bowmanblue,Loosely based on some comic book or other,7,25 November 2014,"Whereas everyone knows Superman and Batman, some may be unfamiliar with the (slightly more violent) comic books of the seventies, The Punisher. The titular character is Frank Castle, an FBI agent whose family is murdered by the mob and so he seeks to reek vengeance on all wrong doers.The Punisher was made into a movie in the eighties (starring Dolph Lundgren) which was met with mixed reactions. It wasn't much like the comics, but it was a fun ride. Now, in 2004, they tried again. This time setting a darker tone (in line with Batman Begins) and casting Thomas Jane as The Punisher.Again, the film was met with mixed reactions. Personally, I don't think it's that bad, but then it does have its faults. First of all Thomas Jane - fine actor he may be, he just seems too small and weedy to be this unstoppable killing machine. Fair play to him for beefing up for the role (he is annoyingly buff!), but still he's too small. If you know the punisher from the comic books, you'll know he's about 6'2 with a Schwarzenegger-like body, plus a craggy, gritty, lived-in face. Thomas Jane is just too much of a pretty boy! However, he does his best (at least he has the voice for it somehow!). Incidentally, Thomas Jane was not in the (semi) sequel 'The Punisher: Warzone.' Instead, Ray Stevenson was cast as the main man. He too was too small (body-wise), but his face - literally - suited the part more as he was uglier (sorry, Ray!).So Thomas Jane goes on a violent killing spree, despatching all those who wrong his late family, right? Wrong. Actually, there's not all that much 'punishment' in the film and it comes across as more of a 'How Frank Castle Became The Punisher' movie, almost like it's actually a prequel to Dolph Lundgren's eighties outing. This lack of constant action may well irritate the fan-boys, denying the film a warmer reception. Perhaps this lack of action may be down to the budget? Normally, 'Marvel' superhero films get a really big budget to play with (think Iron Man, Thor, Avenger etc), but this one is pretty scaled down. It attempts to show the Punisher's 'human side.' We see him having dinner with neighbours, dressing in casual clothes etc. Somehow it 'humanises' a character that is supposed to be colder than your average human (more like the Terminator).But The Punisher did have reasonable success on DVD sales, meaning it wasn't all bad. This could be because it may not have been the most faithful interpretation of the comic, but it was pretty mainstream, i.e. appealing to as many people as possible.I found its main faults were, for one, The Punisher's 'comic relief' neighbours. I hated them. I wanted to see them 'punished' more than the villains. And, secondly, there are a few plot points which left me rolling my eyes. The Punisher is a wanted man, known in the media for illegally slaying people (bad people, but still people). However, he simply lives in a block of flats, spends his days out front tinkering with cars and wandering round the streets, yet no one seems to ever find him. Even the bad guys seem to know where he lives, yet only come for him at home after he's done away with most of them.Anyway, I digress... parts of it annoyed me, but, ultimately, what you have here is a pretty solid 'revenge movie.' You don't have to know or like the comic to enjoy this. If you want some gritty, revenge-based violence, then give this a go.",The Punisher
39,dromasca,"quite well made, but standard B-movie",7,24 October 2004,"'The Punisher' is is a first time directing try of Jonathan Hensleigh the writer of 'Armaggedon' and 'Jimanji'. While the film is quite well made, and scales well within its genre, it lacks exactly what the two scripts I mentioned were good at - a more original idea or approach. It almost looks like the script writer Jonathan Hensleigh did not want to give a too daring script to director Jonathan Hensleigh.It's a genre confusion overall - that originates in a classical comics story, gets a realistic treatment - even brutal sometimes, and ends by being mainly a revenge story. For a change the landscape of the comics action is not some retro-future created with computer effects, but a very realistic contemporary Tampa, taken out from some TV action series. The comics effect is left to the actors, and all of them are quite good, especially Travolta and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, who slightly exceed the level of the film. The acting disappointment is Tom Jane as the main character, he lacks charisma, and if the producers are serious about making a series they should consider replacing him. Overall, it's a well paced action film, it does not feel long despite the two hours, has many good moments, and never a really bad one. Certainly worth a rental. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Punisher
40,g-bodyl,"Bloody, Gritty, and Entertaining!",9,10 October 2014,"Marvel Films, up to this point, has found enormous success with the X-Men and the Spider-Man franchises, but there is one film that is not often on people's radar and that happens to be the Punisher. Marvel films are generally family-friendly, but this film is far from it. It has an enormous amount of action and blood, but it's cheerless and gritty which I like to see every once in awhile. Frank Castle aka The Punisher makes Batman seem like a ray of sunshine. But if you're in the mood for a good, old-fashioned action film, you probably will not be disappointed with this film.Jonathan Hensleigh's film is about a man named Frank Castle who has just witnessed his entire family being murdered and is injured himself. When he recovers, he changes his persona and becomes a man seeking vengeance. He plans on going after Howard Saint and his cronies, the men responsible for the death of his family.The film is full of fine performances. Thomas Jane ""shines"" in his role as Castle. John Travolta makes a capable bad guy and he shines towards the end. His number one henchman is played by the always good Will Patton. We get some good comedy relief by Ben Foster and his pierced character. We even get a cameo by Martin Brody himself, Roy Scheider.Overall, The Punisher is very entertaining despite the high body count and an abundant amount of carnage. The story may not be the greatest, but the film matters most when the bad guys start flying. Marvel never really got popular until the first Iron Man film in 2008, but this is one of their earlier greats. Too bad it doesn't have the popularity it deserves. Lots of action, violence, and blood. Nothing wrong with that. I rate this film 9/10.",The Punisher

When Frank isn't drinking his days away, he is a one-man vigilante to get revenge for the death of his loved ones. I dug this movie, there I said it. I love a good revenge movie, and it's an entertaining revenge film, albeit, overlong. The original Punisher movie bombed. It stars Dolph Lundgren, isn't that great in my opinion. I'll have to give it another look, as I haven't seen it a long time. The first half is a bit better than the second half. The second half involves a lot of psychology which ranges from good to mundane. I felt the second half was a bit too talky at times. I wasn't overly fond of some of the supporting characters in this one, mainly Rebecca Romijn. They just felt kinda there and I got bored quickly of the stuff they did. The lengthy chase scene where the baddies are after Castle's family was really riveting and suspenseful stuff. I was despondent when it was over, which was the reaction it was looking for. The murder of Castle's family isn't easy to watch. There is enough action and violence to please everybody, including some grisly torture scenes. The acting is solid. Thomas Jane is excellent as Frank Castle. He conveys all the proper emotions and I loved his portrayal as the anti-hero. This was a perfect bit of casting. Not many can do bad guys like John Travolta. He was great with his screen time. Roy Scheider is given precious screen time as Frank Castle's dad. WWE legend, Kevin Nash has a role as a giant Russian. The rest of the cast does fine, aside from some of the pointless supporting characters. Final Thoughts: It slows down in the plodding middle section, but the finale makes up for it. It's entertaining overall and I recommend it.7/10",The Punisher

Cast wasn't tempting, I never heard of its director and The Punisher from 1989. was lousy, so I even thought of skipping this one. Fortunately I didn't. To date this is one of the best Marvel movies. Story is well developed but it's not too long or stretched, acting was very good (Travolta's performance was pleasant surprise), directing and music are good, it holds attention from the beginning to the end and it's easy to get involved with the story and characters. I never rated any Marvel movie higher than eight and this one is strong eight. So far, top 5 for me are Howard the Duck (1986), Blade II (2002), Daredevil (2003), The Punisher (2004) and maybe Spider-Man (2002).

This odd superhero (actually an ordinary but special ops) Marvel character movie moves with some difficulty between action, drama, comic figure, and comedy. The graphic, hard violence balanced against the lighter moments almost tear this movie apart...while the typical martial arts build up with the wretched misery our hero must go through are balanced with the more eccentric characters that he finds himself surrounded with. John Travolta has a rather leaden performance while the good guy and bad guy dichotomy make this movie less than impressive movie than it could have been. Yet the movie is consistent, the action compelling, and even the relational connections more intriguing than the usual syrupy stuff the audience is used to.

I quite like Thomas Jane as an actor, and think it's a shame what happened to him over the Stallone movie ""Bullet To The Head"" as I think he would have made the movie better. He does a superb job of all of Frank Castle's various emotions. He deserved to be getting he bigger and better roles than he is. Will Patton does OK as Travolta's right hand man and best friend. For his brief time on screen, Roy Scheider brings style and panache to the overblown violent proceedings early on. But I thought Travolta was at his hammiest.

This new version of the Punisher is awesome in My opinion! Tom Jane was perfect as the Punisher. He gave an all business attitude! His muscular physique is amazing and he put a lot of emotion into this great character. John Travolta arguably had the biggest spotlight. In My opinion he played a great villain and performed greatly! Will Patton also had a great role and performed really well as a villain. The three actresses Romijn-Stamos, Harring, and Mathis all performed well. Roy Scheider performed well and looked great in his brief role. But the one that really surprised Me was none other than Kevin Nash as The Russian! I am a huge Kevin Nash fan as I have followed most of his years in Pro Wrestling. He looked excellent as this incredible character. He has become one of My most favorite villains in a movie! For the action and the violence, there is plenty of violence and all of the action is top notch! In fact, there are many scenes that made Me say ""wow"" and other things out loud and one of the scenes for example is when The Russian appears and fights The Punisher! The music is good and the movie is filmed differently. So if you are a Marvel Comics fan and like Thomas Jane, John Travolta, Will Patton, Romijn-Stamos, Roy Scheider, and want to see Kevin Nash in one of the most spectacular scenes ever and also want non-stop top notch action and surprising violence then do what I did and buy this movie now!

50,johnnyboyz,A Hard and tough action/revenge film that has good grounds for a sequel yet feels like a prequel to something I've not seen.,6,29 May 2007,"Before being made into a film, The Punisher was actually a graphic novel and when I learnt of this, I was slightly surprised at the way in which the filmmakers approached the material. Although it was a whole year before the film that was Sin City graced our screens; The Punisher more resembles that of a typical cartoon action film adaptation; think Spider Man or Schumacher's Batman films.While this isn't a bad thing, the film does feel like it's one big build up to the closing scenes in which the hero is due his revenge. Like most comic book heroes, Frank Castle (Jane) oversees a tragic event that really messes his life up and must now turn absolute rebel in order to fix things. This remake of a 1989 film staring Dolph Lundgren plays out more like Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1985 outing: Commando and this is evident through its presentation of hard, sweaty bodies, numerous guns on display, montages and working out scenes as Castle trains for the final showdown.What makes it different to Commando, and on the whole; quite good is its attention to its subject matter. Early on when one character has lost his son to a shooting; the locations he inhabits with his wife are very dark, bleak and damp  resembling his emotions whereas for our hero, everything is all fun and games as he hasn't a care in the world and is living it up in a hot, sunny utopia that is the Caribbean. Also, the fight scenes and action set pieces are actually quite impressive, initially. The feeling of chase and realism are present as we see Castle and some of his family members shoot and miss numerous enemies just as we see them shoot and miss on occasion in return. This not only draws out the impressive fight scenes but adds a sense of realism that it's not always 'one shot kills' for the good guys.The Punisher is also consistent in its violence. The film gradually gets more and more gory as Castle nears his goal with knifes and bows and arrows coming into the equation as well as a torture scene half way through but the film sticks to its roots and includes everything it needs to.Sadly, when you look at this film from the wider angle it's nothing more than a typical revenge film with a feint love interest, a moody and emotionless anti-hero, and since the director doesn't add anything particularly special to it that makes it stand out there's nothing going for it in that particular department labelled 'auteur'. This is big budget, grand scale epic violence that pulls no punches and that happily substitutes an original maybe witty script, standout acting performances or anything else in favour of it.The Punisher left me with an odd feeling that, really, it was just a pilot for a sequel - which can't be a good thing. What's promising though, is the fact that now we know about his back story, how he deals with his enemies and what kind of a character he's like  the sequel can press on and become something rather memorable. It has the opportunity to do so, after all.",The Punisher

Not only does it have someone who can act, unlike the older one, it's so much more exciting. This one's been peppered with so much more. It's as if the original has been given a whole new makeover. This one, more lengthened out, is a darn sight more exciting, colorfully as with it's baddies, especially Will Patton, where again Travolta shows us he can play bad just as good as playing good. Where as the original had Lundgren also taking out other trash, unrelated to the people, responsible for taking out his family, what we have here is vigilante (Jane) sticking to one plan, retaining the same name as in the original, disposing of every single body responsible for executing his whole family, including wife and kid. It was in retaliation for a sting operation, where one of Travolta's sons were killed, where his wife implored him to kill Jane's whole family, (a beefy Roy Schieder as his dad) where of course Jane survives. No one loves revenge more than me, and here we lap it out, where it's not always pretty. I'm never gonna forget hit-man, Harry Heck, or a few other characters like Jane's new found neighbors and friends, one girl who's sweet on him, another one played by comedian John Pinette. The end of the movie, leaves it mark too, 'a have to see' moment. As with other remakes, we can be sure they'll be livelier, and gorier, if sometimes overindulging. Hey that's not a problem, where here, it works splendidly, with a great choice of lead, in Jane as the hero vigilante.

55,generationofswine,An Honest Review,5,18 November 2016,"It wasn't bad, at least it wasn't as bad as the critics say, and let's face it, the Punisher is a pretty hard thing to translate into film. It has to walk that line between comic book movie, mafia movie, and serial killer movie and that is a hard line to follow.Punisher: War Zone leaned far too much towards the comic book angle and the film really stank because of it.The Punisher 1990 found that balance, but it did it in only the way a B-movie in the 1990s could.The Punisher 2004 tried to find it, but it got lost somewhere in the shuffle. What it got instead was a little too jumbled to be really good.For starters it suffered from origin syndrome. People walking into a movie like The Punisher already know the origin story. They know it as well as they know Captain America, the Hulk, and the Fantastic Four, so for the comic book audience, which is probably the majority of viewers, a big part of the plot is revealing something that we already know is going to happen. We are forced to watch it all ply out before we can get to the plot.Conversely, those walking in completely fresh can easily be told the origin in a less painful way for Punisher fans.Besides the movie already got a solid ""R"" rating, there is no way you can show how Frank actually became the Punisher and keep it under NC-17 for violent content.In the case of the Punisher, the origin is something we'd all rather be told than shown. No one wants to watch that, even when you cut away to keep it rated R, we still don't want to see it.So the first chunk of a movie is a set up to watch children get murdered, and then we finally get into the story.Where the movie wins is the blood and violence. They keep it adult action movie enough to stay true to the Punisher comics. it wins out there and does it with a stylistic tone that helps redeem the film.The only problem is you have to sit through the set-up, watch material you already know by heart, only to see the disgusting act of violence that pushes Frank over the edge before you get to the redeeming parts of the film...and by then it's a little too late to completely salvage it.",The Punisher

If gangsters didn't run down his wife and child, shoot up his family reunion in a storm of gunfire, Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) would not dawn the skull and arsenal and would not endure hell (and at the same time raise it) to exact revenge on Howard Saint (John Travolta), the man who ordered the hit.Castle is unique amongst Marvel's cavalry of heroes because he's a loner and a vigilante - a particularly ruthless vigilante at that. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a hardcore ""Punisher"" fan, but Frank Castle is the most human of heroes that I've seen. He has no superhuman abilities like his MANY contemporaries, but instead survives on his will and desire to see those that are guilty, punished.I was first introduced to the ""The Punisher"" when I was 8 years old back in 1993; my mom had made a run to the local comic book store at the mall and purchased ""Venom: Funeral Pyre - Part 3 of 3,"" and in it, Venom and The Punisher were attempting to bring down a powerful villain with pyrotechnic abilities.And just last year, I purchased a hardcover copy of ""The Punisher,"" which featured the ""Welcome Back, Frank"" story that was written by Garth Ennis, and the storyline of the 2004 film is partially based on this line.Jane, whose most notable credit was that of the shark wrangler in 1999's ""Deep Blue Sea,"" hits all the right notes as the psychotic Frank Castle. There was much debate about how he would not be able to pull off the role and all those criticisms can be dismissed with a wave of the hand.Travolta is an excellent choice to play the main villain, Howard Saint. Saint is a ruthless killer himself, who also seems to put forth a little too much trust in his employees, as this is what inevitably leads to his demise at the hands of The Punisher. Both Saint and Castle are motivated by the same thing: revenge, which makes them equal adversaries.""The Punisher"" is different from most Marvel adaptations as of late, and I think that the ""R"" rating had a serious impact on its overall performance at the theaters. The action scenes are brutal and bloody, and I congratulate director Jonathan Hensleigh for remaining faithful to the spirit of the comics by not toning the violence in favor of box office profit.8/10",The Punisher
58,alindsay-al,An above average unique comic book film,6,4 September 2015,"These last few years there have been a number of great comic book films. There have been a few punisher films and this version was decent but could have been improved. The premise of the film sees retired cop frank castles family get killed and he decides to take the law in his own hands and get revenge as the punisher. Thomas jane plays the punisher and I think he did a great job in this film. I truly felt the pain in his character and he did a great job of portraying a damaged vigilante who wants revenge. John travolta plays the villain in this film and I actually enjoyed his character more then I would. He delivered a good performance even though there wasn't that much to his character. There are some characters like castles neighbours are annoying and completely pointless characters. I really enjoyed the personal revenge story as castle goes through his plan of revenge. However, there is this forced story with his neighbours and it takes up such a large part of the film that it comes across as pointless. There was a deleted scene story arc that is ten times more interesting then this. The script has some pretty good dramatic dialogue in it but sometimes the dialogue is awful and it just comes across as the wrong type of cheesy. There are some good action scenes in the movie especially the one involving Kevin Nash as it feels truly heavy hitting. Sometimes the action doesn't hit the intensity that you want which hurts the film. Also there are some times where the effects are lacking and it hurts the film. Overall this is a decent comic book film that is pretty unique.",The Punisher
59,iquine,Don't Anger John Castle,6,10 January 2019,"(Flash Review)This man produced the most brutal revenge punishment I can recall. And what else would one expect from a movie called The Punisher; derived from the bloody comic book series. He dealt oodles of creative and gruesome vengeance. Castle was apparently wrapping up his career as an undercover agent in which a mobster boss's son gets killed. Boss = Angry and goes all out to kill not only Castle but his entire family during a family reunion; children too. Yet fails to snuff out Castle. Now Castle = Angry and while the Boss's henchmen are still trying to kill him, he begins to exact his own dark and cold revenge. The movie is full if what you came for; distinctive, bloody and vicious killings all free of CGI. Yet it does mix in some light humor to cut the heavy mood. But overall, the story is expected and rather general but fun if you are in the mindset for it.",The Punisher
60,jimbo-53-186511,The Saints go marching in against an emotionless robust and immovable Castle,9,5 May 2020,"Undercover FBI agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) becomes a target from the mob after mob boss Howard Saint's son is killed amongst the crossfire when the FBI move in to make an arrest. Blaming Castle for his son's death, Howard orders his heavies to kill Frank's family and they also leave Frank for dead. Unhappy with the way the police are handling the murder case surrounding his family (and being powerless to intervene having recently retired) Castle takes matters into his own hands and seeks revenge against the Saints...Whilst The Punisher generally delivered in the areas I expected it to in some areas it actually exceeded my expectations; for one thing The Punisher has a bit of heart and feeling about it. We get an insight into Castle's life; his wonderful home life and the lovely family that's he's surrounded by. This is an excellent way to set the story up as it really helps to turn the thumb screws when Castle's family are killed and he decides to seek his revenge. Like Charles Bronson in Death Wish, this is just an ordinary guy who is unhappy with the justice system who decides to take the law into his own hands. Of course Castle's actions are morally wrong, but it's clear he had so much to live for and to have everything that meant anything to him taken away from him was devastating and as he references at one point in the film 'He has nothing to lose' which acts as a driver for his vengeance.For a film based on revenge The Punisher is quite long (clocking in at just shy of 2 hours), but it never feels like it's a long film. From start to finish pretty much every scene has both point and purpose and the film at a very early stage settles in to a satisfying sort of fluidity making The Punisher feel like one of the shortest 2 hour films that I've seen. I did have my concerns when our 3 inquisitive neighbours arrived in the story, but despite them being annoying for around 5 minutes even they served some purpose in the story and showed that they were actually good people.One other thing I liked about this film was some aspects of the narrative; there is one section of the film where Castle plays Saint and one of his loyal henchman off against each other (I won't say how he achieved this, but let's just say that Castle isn't all braun - he's actually pretty damn smart). There's plenty of action in this film and Castle's vulnerability is shown at one point when he's forced to fight a massive Russian (WWE's Kevin Nash) which was one of the many highlights in this film.The acting here is top drawer as well; Thomas Jane is absolutely superb as Frank Castle (at every stage of the narrative) being very convincing going from a man who had everything to live for to nothing. Travolta is also really good here (one of the best performances I've seen from him). Ben Foster was also good here in a very early role as a whacky hippy type who proves his worth in the film. The rest of the supporting cast were good and a special mention to Laura Harring for just being impossibly attractive and I have to say I did appreciate the figure hugging dresses that she wore in this film.Of course the film has a couple of shortcomings; villains 'leaving someone for dead.' - why are they always 'left for dead'? Does nobody ever check for a pulse?' I get that this is not limited to this film, but it's just one of those things that annoys me in films. Also Castle confirming to the Saints that he's alive was a risky strategy as it naturally means that they would know he would come looking for them and it gives them time to plot a counter-attack. Wouldn't a smarter move have been to let them think he was dead and then plot a surprise attack?In the interest of suspending some disbelief I really didn't care to be honest. The Punisher entertained me for 2 hours and not only that but I also thought elements of the narrative were clever and it also had some heart to it as well. All round it was brilliant stuff.",The Punisher
61,juneebuggy,Better than I expected with (fun) OTT action scenes,7,16 October 2014,"This was better than I expected, especially if you watch it as ""based on a comic book"" and not so much as an action film. The beginning is very good -dark- as we watch 'Frank Castle' lose his entire family (including Roy Scheider) in a mob hit. John Travolta plays the mob boss and was great, meeting his demise in a totally violent ending as ""The Punisher"" destroys his life. Wow he really gets his revenge! The fight scenes in general are pretty over the top but in a fun way, especially the one with the large Russian hit man. That was awesome. The three nerdy neighbors (including Ben Foster) provide some humor and humanity. On a side note the guy playing Castle/Punisher (Thomas Jane) looks so much like Christopher Lambert that it must really suck for him getting roles. I thought it was Lambert until I checked IMDb. His sorta love interest also resembled Rebecca Romijn. 04.13.14",The Punisher
62,lukem-52760,TOM JANE IS THE GREATEST PUNISHER OF ALL TIME MY BEST MARVEL FILM STILL.,8,4 March 2019,"Thomas Jane is still the best Punisher aka:Frank Castle in my opinion I've loved this violent revenge action Thriller since buying it on video way back in early 2000's & still love it now in 2019!!!!
It's a comfort watching this even more so now as this world is so lawless & violent & full of evil that watching ""The Punisher"" brutally take out scum is a pleasure to watch & i enjoy it so much & completely agree with his vigilante ways!!!!
The Punisher has become my favourite ""Action"" movie of all time, it's also become my favourite ""Revenge"" film too as this superb dark Thriller ticks all the right boxes for what i love about old school vigilante/Revenge films as well as old school Action flicks & yes i love ""Schwarzenegger"" & others i grew up watching but this one extremely underrated Comic book based Movie is the best blend of all that I've seen in a film!!! I love the Action genre & The Punisher fits right into that genre perfectly, it even feels old school.
I loved the performances especially from ""Tom Jane"" & his arch nemesis ""Travolta"" who is an evil piece of work,
I found this movie to be so entertaining & exciting so i don't understand the ridiculous Hate this film got? Yet fools loved the Terrible Deadpool?
There's alot more depth & emotion rooted in to this take on the Punisher, i really liked how ""Human"" he was as he bleeds & gets hurt alot, he's no Superman & he's not a super hero, he's a depressed & broken man who lives only for revenge & Tom Jane nails the part!!! It's still his greatest role in my opinion & i would've loved a sequel.We won't get another Marvel movie like this again as ""Disney"" owns Marvel now so the gritty violent stuff will only be available as say a t.v series on Netflix like the Punisher is now, but it doesn't compare to ""Tom Jane"" & his Punisher movie in my Nostalgic opinion.
Tom Jane gives an excellent raw, brooding & angry performance as ""Frank Castle"" who loses his family to gangsters & becomes the tortured vigilante known as ""The Punisher"".I love this movie so much because it's made very old school in the mould of those old 70's & 80's revenge Thrillers that would star tough guy legends such as ""Charles Bronson"" or ""Lee Marvin"" & Tom Jane fits into that type of role perfectly, he beefed up for the muscled Marvel vigilante & he looks fantastic.
This is an extremely dark vigilante film, in ways it's as dark & aggressive as the 70's ""Bronson"" Classic ""Death Wish"", the ""family slaughter"" scene is still a savage & shocking sequence even by today's ultra violent standards!!!
The Action is brutal & bloody & doesn't hold back, the long fight between ""Frank"" & ""The Russian"" is as much a fun scene as it is a brutal & violent one!!!
The Director obviously knows the old school action-Thriller genre well as his movie is paced like those old 70's films.
The look & cinematography is excellent & the ""Punisher"" theme/score is fantastic, it's sad & heroic at the same time!!!This also one of the greatest revenge movies ever made, right up there with the classic's ""Taxi Driver"" ""Death Wish"" ""Dirty Harry"" ""The Exterminator"" & ""Mad Max"" this movie is drenched in that mould of hard core revenge fantasies.
Yes that music score is beautifully haunting & the family beach massacre is still so cruel,shocking & upsetting it's a powerful movie not just a comic book movie, it's way deeper & more emotional, some scenes are truly amazing in there shock value & excellent gritty direction!!!The Punisher is filmed really well too with none of that messy flashy c.g.i crap all over the place like all of todays Marvel movies, oh no this looks like a proper old school movie with grit & brutal action & it's glorious, in fact the movie looks very 90's.
Also it's great to have the legendary iconic ROY SCHEIDER r.i.p from ""Jaws"" fame playing frank castle's old father it's a nice little important role & i think one of his last & i love ""Roy Scheider"".I truly believe ""Thomas Jane"" will become legendary in his later acting years & will have a huge cult following just like veteran legends ""Charles Bronson"" & ""Tom Atkins"".
Tom Jane is a great actor & can do everything from sci-fi action Horror to comedy & old school revenge he's fantastic, by the way he completely steals the show in the new ""Predator"" movie!!! I'm a big fan since ""Deep Blue Sea"".
The Punisher is one of my favourite movies of all time & still my absolute favourite ""Marvel"" film to date!!!
An action packed cult classic, this is one of my favourite Comic book films ever & sits right next to the masterpiece ""Dredd"" both outstanding",The Punisher
63,Enchorde,Disappointing comic-book-movie,4,18 September 2004,"**HERE BE SPOILERS**Undercover agent Frank Castle (Jane) has done his last job. Unfortunately that included the death of Bobby Saint (Carpinello), son of Livia (Harring) and Howard Saint (Travolta). They want revenge. The whole Castle ""clan"" is to be wiped out. So, most trusted henchman Glass (Patton) is sent and the clan is wiped out, with one exception, Frank Castle. Now it is time for punishment. Not revenge, Castle clearly states that, but he's just delusional. Of course it is about revenge, why else openly declare war on the Saints. And then one by one, he kills (or make the Saints kill among themselves) those responsible for the murder of his family.And therein is the major flaw of the movie. He is never really opposed. Even if he holds some sort of press conference outside the police headquarters to announce his quest. There is only one time he seems to be in little trouble. The Saints have no trouble finding out his hide-out, and sends ""the Russian"" (Nash). I've always wondered (in most movies) why well organized mobsters always send only one to do their dirty work. I guess they do have some sense of honor and fair play even if they otherwise is the cruelest person ever to walk the face of earth. Me, I would have send an army. Well the fight between Castle and the Russian is plain stupid. Here you can see the comic-book origin. The Russian is virtually indestructible, not caring if being stabbed or beaten with crow-bar, until he tumbles down the stairs with Castle (who himself has been beaten through walls, stabbed etc) and drops dead. In the end comes the major disappointment, the final fight. Howard has finally gathered a small army and one expects somewhat of a shootout. But no, Castle manages to sneak a grenade/bomb into their midst, killing or incapacitating everybody, including the boss Howard. Even though he actually manages to limp out into the parking lot before being shot, and never ever fighting back. Now that may actually be realistic, I doubt many could fight back after being in the same room as a bomb went off. But why introduce this realism at the end, where I guess most people expect a great and a somewhat unrealistic fight, is beyond my imagination. Castle somewhat makes up for this by setting of an enormous amount of explosion showing off his artistic nature (you'll see what I mean).I haven't mentioned his friends and some other cast, including Rebecca Romjin, because to me they we're mostly not important to the story.So, otherwise than the odd flaws this movie shows, it is entertaining in its own way. If you like some action this might enjoy you, but to me, never reach any heights.4/10",The Punisher
64,Jonny_Numb,Cinematic Punishment,3,21 October 2007,"""The Punisher"" sits in some weird limbo between ""Death Wish"" and a Saturday Night Live sketch (note that I would be citing Monty Python if it were carried out with any flair or originality); it's based on the long-running Marvel comic and, according to a good friend of mine, is a faithful cinematic rendering of its roots. The hero is named Castle (Thomas Jane); the villains are Saint (John Travolta) and Glass (Will Patton), and what may come across as tongue-in-cheek irony on a page translates dumbly to the screen. Director/co-writer Jonathan Hensleigh presents events with little imagination, and draws the simplistic story well beyond what most viewers will tolerate. Vigilanstim has always been a hit-or-miss subject in movies, from the successful (""Death Wish""; ""Dirty Harry"") to the failed (this year's ""Death Sentence""), and ""The Punisher""--despite a great potential that often threatens to break the surface--brings nothing new to the table. Thomas Jane plays our stoic hero, who leads a prominent gangster's (Travolta) son to be killed in a sting operation; shortly after, his family (including wife and son) is massacred; as with most vigilantes, Castle forgoes the tearful mourning and becomes The Punisher, a broken man hell-bent on dishing out extravagant, eye-for-an-eye justice. With the comic-book as reference, this should have been a stylish work, but Hensleigh's direction goes straight to cable with sluggishly edited chases and shootouts (never has vengeance been less thrilling), and once-credible actors (namely Travolta and Roy Scheider) delivering lines well beneath their talent. In one badly conceived sequence, our hero scuffles with a towering brute who randomly shows up outside his apartment, crashing through walls and taking hits as the neighbors listen to a festive song--a clumsy juxtaposition that offers neither laughs nor thrills (and really just attests to the film's tonal inconsistency overall); there is another sequence involving an acoustic musician who sings a song before making an attempt on Castle's life that is just as absurd. And a subplot where Saint's wife and partner are set up by Castle is poorly executed, in part because we're ahead of the characters the entire time. The only thing ""The Punisher"" really has going for it are the 3 stereotypes who share the hallway with Castle--Waitress (Rebecca Romijn), Meek Dork (Ben Foster--""3:10 to Yuma""), and Overweight Chef (John Pinette) who have a genuine chemistry that would have been more endearing in a better film. As it stands, this comic-book adaptation is merely punishing the intelligence of film patrons.",The Punisher
65,rbverhoef,"Dark, brutal",6,22 November 2004,"Here is a comic book movie that never really feels like one. It feels like the darkest revenge story possible. Compared to this 'The Crow' is a happy movie. This does not mean the movie itself is that bad, there are some terrific moments and its hero played by Thomas Jane is quite interesting. He becomes the Punisher because his family is slaughtered. The man responsible for this is Howard Saint (John Travolta), although his wife (Laura Harring - 'Mulholland Drive') is the one who suggests to kill the whole family instead of just the Jane-character. (Who is named Frank Castle by the way.) Saint wants Castle dead since he is partly responsible for the death of Saint's son; he died in a weapon deal and Castle was the undercover cop. So Castle's family is killed and Castle himself is shot a couple of times, he is literally blown away, lands in the water and survives.Time for revenge, although according to himself vengeance has nothing to do with it. This is punishment. Jane makes sure we believe him. He moves into a building where we meet three others: Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Bumpo (John Pinette) and Spacker Dave (Ben Foster). Although Castle is always on himself and strange noises come from his place the three try to involve him with things. Although the characters are well put it seems especially one of them is there for just one horrific scene. When Saint finds out where Castle lives one of the three is tortured to make him speak. The guy has quite some piercings in his face; you do the maths. If the scene wants to be horrific it succeeds. It is the more visual version of what Michael Madsen suggests to Uma Thurman in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' and that scene was quite horrific already.The plot continues the way you expect a plot like this does. Of course things are implausible but since Jane, Travolta, who always makes an excellent villain, and Will Patton, who is Travolta's sidekick and the one who does the torturing, make their characters more believable you would expect in a movie like this, you take things for granted. That the movie is so dark and brutal is a reason a lot of people will not like it. Compare it to the fast paced, colored, comic book films like 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' to realize how dark this movie really is. In colors and in tone.I have to mention one sort of happy scene. Castle is fighting in the building with a Russian guy, a brutal fight, but the way this is handled makes sure you will laugh more than once. Touches like this make this movie entertaining enough to give it a try.",The Punisher

67,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A decent action revenge film with its flaws,7,25 July 2012,"Besides Ghost Rider, The Punisher is another one of my favorite Marvel characters in particular. I liked almost everything about it except for some minor areas. Like most superhero or anti-hero characters, the background of The Punisher is a tragic story. It is the piece of the title role's life that is taken away from them that makes them who we know them as now. Peter Parker loses his uncle (Spiderman), Johnny Blaze loses his father (Ghost Rider), and for Frank Castle's case; his entire family (The Punisher).Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), is a well renowned FBI agent. Unfortunately, things go awry when his family gets caught in the cross-hairs of his job and are slain right before his eyes. It is from there that Frank Castle becomes The Punisher. However, I would like to know how a group of gunmen find the EXACT whereabouts of Castle and his family and are able to creep up on them, UNDETECTED, and get away with several murders.Pam Dixon's choice to cast Jane as Frank Castle was an accurate decision. Dixon, who also was in charge of casting for The Mask of Zorro (1998) and Tremors (1990) seems to really have a knack for picking the right actors for each character role. Jane's grungy voice makes The Punisher sound like he really has no remorse for anyone or anything. Also Jane's ability to make Castle seem like he has an endless amount of firepower is just too good to watch.The selfish mobster who has Castle's family killed was by Howard Saint, played by John Travolta. Travolta plays the character of Howard Saint fairly well. However, I think Travolta could've been much more sinister with his character, but he never takes it in that direction. On a side note I like to say that even though I knew that Castle's family was going to do die, I never thought I would feel so much emotion when it occurred. I really felt bad for Jane's character when he was rushing to save his wife and son.As stated before, The Punisher's arsenal is wicked. Nothing but the best here. This makes the action sequences a lot of fun to watch. I loved how director Jonathan Hensleigh filmed the driving sequences, much of it was almost out of control and I was surprised the actors didn't fall out of the cars! I also loved the noises that were made whenever The Punisher was loading all his weapons; what fun! Yet somehow, at the end of the film I felt like I didn't get my eye-full's worth and that disappointed me.A few other things I didn't seem to understand was that actors need to be louder when they talk and some of Howard Saint's emotional moments. At first, I didn't understand the random cameo of Mark Collie as Harry Heck. He pops into a diner to sing Castle a song, almost like he pities his pain,...just to show up in the next scene trying to kill him. Um what? What did we accomplish here? Turned out I missed a significant line by one of Saint's henchman saying they hired a man from Memphis to kill Castle because it was mentioned last minute in a specific scene with little to no defined moment.I also wasn't fond of Castle making this huge plan of getting back at Howard Saint. I liked how he carried out his plan but it dragged. Seriously, for a character with a much darker personality, I was expecting something quite quick and brutal. Instead the audience experiences emotional moments where Saint confronts his issues with tears. The musical score by Carlo Siliotto was good though. The piano in the background really pulls on the heartstrings. Overall, it was decent, it just needed a few things tightened up.Thomas Jane gives a great performance as Frank Castle but the fact that the plot drags can get a little tedious. Besides this though, the music and action sequences are a guilty pleasure.",The Punisher
68,lemon_magic,"Comes close to the gallows humor of the revived series, but has pacing problems",6,16 July 2005,"There was quite a bit to like about this updated version of ""The Punisher"",but it couldn't quite make the leap to greatness like the X-men and Spider-Man franchises. Some of that is due to the nature of the character himself (Frank Castle makes the guy from the ""Death Wish"" movies look like Dudley Do-Right) and some of it due to the obviously smaller cast and budget. First of all, Thomas Jane was very, very good in the role. He fills out the Skull-shirt extremely well - he's even buffer (if not as tall) than Dolph Lundgren in the earlier version. And his gravelly voice and deadpan delivery are one-dimensional in a good kind of way. He's got just enough humanity left in his eyes to let the viewer discern the pain of the character underneath the muscles. I've heard mixed reviews of Jane in other movies, but since this is my first exposure to him in a leading role, I am impressed. Secondly, the director took a chance and included one of the highlights of the original Punisher Maxiseries that revived the character in all his Garth Ennis/Steve Dillon glory - the brutal fight with the Russian. In some ways, this is the absolute best scene in the movie - there is a hilariously over-the-top slapstick quality to the brawling as Frank tries to hit the Russian with everything short of the kitchen sink, and the Russian proceeds to beat the living hell out of Frank with everything else in the apartment, including Franks own bathroom toilet. Horrifying yet screamingly funny, this fight has more energy and inventiveness to it than any other scene in the film, or fight scenes in most other films. Thirdly, when Castle finally gets rolling and comes after the Saint family for the final showdown, he goes through the bad guys with merciless élan and finality - it's a lot like watching field mice get chopped down by a rotary mower. But the timings and the staging of the violence is brief, invigorating and cathartic, unlike many other films in the crime-revenge genre. Arnold, I'm pointing at you and your movie ""Raw Deal"", with a final showdown that seemed to take a full hour. But I claimed this movie didn't make the leap to greatness, and I stand by that claim. For one thing, Saint just isn't a big enough target for the Punisher's wrath - sure Saint has some soldiers at his disposal, but he is pretty obviously a small time wheeler dealer. You never really believe that he is an actual match for Castle once Castle becomes the Punisher. And Saint is an idiot, too - he falls for the most transparent ploy imaginable to drive a wedge between him and his main man. The actors who play Frank's neighbors - and who provide romantic interest, human involvement and comic relief - seem to exist in a vacuum, and there is both too little and too much of them in the movie. Too little, because they are sketchily written caricatures, and the actors don't have enough room or time to make the characters interesting or believable. Too much, because the time spent farting around with these characters in a seemingly abandoned old apartment building kind of robs the plot of much of its forward momentum. The situation and the characters worked in the comics because Ennis and Dillon had 12 issues to spread their story arc across and plenty of time to get everything in, but it doesn't work here in a two hour movie.But there aren't any bad performances here - everyone is at least B-grade professional; and there is enough humor, energy, and mean-spirited weirdness to make ""The Punisher"" stand out from all the other urban vigilante stories out there. If there is a sequel, and Jane is in it, I will try to go see it.",The Punisher

I still gave this one a change, mainly because a friend of mine is a fan of this movie and he normally doesn't like all this movie all too much either. I watched it and it was better than all the movies that I named before, but in my opinion it certainly wasn't as good as Spiderman.Frank Castle is an FBI special agent. During his last undercover operation, in which he tries to sell guns to the local mafia, the FBI wants to arrest the buyers, but something goes wrong and shots are being fired. Frank Castle gets hit, as well as one of the mafia guys, who appears to be the son of an important money launderer. Frank Castle survives, but the other one dies. Because the father is so upset that his son died because of Frank Castle's operation, he wants to punish Castle. They decide not only to kill Frank Castle, but his entire family. Castle's entire family gets killed in a huge gunfight, but miraculously he survives. Now he will not rest until he has found the ones who killed his family and justice has been done.To my taste the story is a bit too predictable. Of course he had a wonderful family which is taken away from him by the bad guys and of course he wants to take revenge, although he doesn't call it that way. He calls it justice, because revenge is some kind of emotion in his opinion. But even though it is a bit predictable, the movie isn't all that bad. The acting was decent, but not exceptional, but especially the action scenes were nice and I'm sure many people will love all the pyrotechnics. All in all this isn't such a bad movie and that's why I give it a 6/10",The Punisher

The fact that Frank's entire family is killed and a lot of his friends were as well was enough for me. John Travolta was really good in this as Mr Saint. But a SAINT he was not! He was ruthless and shot people for no reason. Also, he talked in a REALLY FUNNY accent. The ending of the movie is really funny when John Travolta gets dragged through the burning cars and screams as he burns to death!

In this second attempt to adapt one of Marvel Comics' iconic vigilantes 'The Punisher' after an unsuccessful outing starring Dolph Lungreen, this film follows FBI agent Frank Castle (played by Thomas Jane) who busts a violent arms dealing duo, one of which is Bobby Saint (played by James Spinello) who happens to be the son of crime boss Howard Saint (played by John Travolta). The ambush results in their deaths as they are both gun down by Castle and his team of FBI agents. Angered at the death of his son, Howard Saint orders his goon to execute Frank Castle. In attempt join to enjoy a peaceful weekend with his wife and son, Castle vacations to Puerto Rico for a family reunion. The weekend quickly turns into a harrowing nightmare when the family is paid an unexpected visit by a gang of hit men lead by Saint, who launch a brutal massacre that leads to the death of his family, and him severely wounded. Upon recovery, Frank Castle vows revenge on Saint and adopts his alter ego 'The Punisher', sporting a black shirt with a skull on it and a jacket full of firearms. This film is directed by Jonathan Hensleigh.This is not your average Marvel Comics superhero flick. This film, following an antihero who sets out for revenge a violent mob boss, retains an R-rating with its dark atmosphere and extremely violent nature So if you go into this movie expecting light-hearted superhero actioner that Marvel superhero movies are typically known for, you are in unpleasant awakening. Although this movie resents from Marvel's typical cheery atmosphere in favor of a more dreadful atmosphere that never seems to light up, the biggest suffering of this film is some mediocre action scenes, poor pacing, and a villain who is less than memorable. Going into a superhero flick, or vigilante thriller for his matter; you would expect to see some exciting action sequences to keep the plot pacing. The action here is a rather infrequent, and when it occurs, its not entertaining. The fight scenes here are so boring and slow that at times, it gets pretty frustrating. The first action sequence which takes place at Frank Castle's family reunion on the beach is nicely shot, and really set the (dreary) tone of the film. The final shootout in the end however, is the only action scene that really stands out above the lifeless venture the film endures. When the action lets down, the film is constantly building with overblown exposition to the point when it becomes so mundane. Furthermore, the main villain Howard Saint who is played by John Travolta is one of the least memorable ever put to Marvel comics film. His character is so uninteresting and wooden that it hard to care for him. Travolta's performance is not bad, but it certainly doesn't redeem his character by much. Thomas Jane plays the titular role fine, and much like John Travolta's role the depressing nature of his character give very little to speak of.The Punisher is an vigilante action thriller that had some much potential, but wasted it on a poorly paced plot, mundane characters, and the action scenes that simply do not hold up. Most importantly, the atmosphere of this film is so mean and depressing that it is hard to enjoy, and those who are unfamiliar with such a mature territory like this one will mostly likely feel less compelled by this one. This is not a Marvel film I recommend.",The Punisher
74,pyrocitor,The real punishment is trying to keep a straight face,5,30 December 2004,"Spoilers hereinWith a title like ""the Punisher"" showing a guy with a skull t-shirt holding a couple of guns, it's fairly easy to predict the plot of a movie like this. Tough guy takes on most of the mob by himself with the help of a ridiculous arsenal of firearms, or something along those lines. Well, that happens to be exactly the plot of the film ""The Punisher"": ex-marine Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is after top smuggler and mobster Howard Saint (John Travolta) for having his family slaughtered in revenge for Castle accidentally and unwillingly killing his son Bobby (James Carpinello) while on assignment. Problem is, Castle was supposed to be killed as well. But through some miraculous circumstances, he survives being shot in the heart... and the chest... and the leg... and thrown into the ocean... and probably various other injuries to absurd to be remembered. The movie is (presumably) meant to be serious and thought-provoking (something around as deep as ""was Castle justified in killing all those people just because his family got murdered?"") but it's hard to view it as such when Castle keeps surviving worse and worse injuries. The laughable and tremendously cheesy and clichéd dialogue doesn't make it any easier (""God's gonna sit this one out"") and most of Thomas Jane's scripted lines were clearly ""(manly grunt)"". Sadly enough, Punisher doesn't stop with the old ""shoot through 'em all and occasionally change weapons for variety"" plan which could have worked a lot better. (there are a couple of good fight scenes here and there, but nothing that we haven't seen before) But no, instead, he has to try to be an intellectual. So his 'thinking man's master plan' to trick Howard Saint into killing his own wife (Laura Harring) is something along the lines of placing a fake fire hydrant next to her car so she gets a parking ticket. Then he keeps tricking Saint's second in command, Quentin Glass (Will Patton) into being at the same place at the same time as her. So, when Saint finds this out, he will assume that his wife is having an affair with Glass, and kill them both, which is what he does. (he's an angry guy!) Clever, eh? Actually it somewhat is, but they lost me (and most of my fellow audience) after the bit with the fake fire hydrant from laughing so hard. It looks really, really ridiculous seeing this grim looking guy with a skull shirt placing a fire hydrant next to a car. Oh, and did I mention that the Punisher has a Punishermobile? Well he does, a painfully ugly green bulletproof car. I'm surprised it didn't have a skull on it; it wouldn't have seemed much stupider.Despite the fact that he barely gets to say anything other than grunting all the time, Jane isn't at all a bad action lead, doing his best to provide his shallow character with some depth, silently musing over whether his actions are the 'just' thing to do considering his circumstances. Unfortunately for Jane, all the character depth director Jonathan Hensleigh seems to want is for Jane to spend most of the film with his shirt off to show the audience that he spent some time working out for this role. (which is almost certainly why most of his lines are simply manly grunts, as long as he keeps his shirt off, the audience is satisfied... right?) Surprisingly, John Travolta isn't tremendously disappointing either in the role of mob baron Howard Saint, but he is restricted to one mood throughout the entire film (he's an angry guy!) which really slows down the villainy element. Roy Scheider also appears in what is little more than an extended cameo as Punisher's dad, who also gets killed in the mass execution of Castle's family.Then we get the array of supporting cast with names like 'Bumpo' and 'Spacker Dave' who are supposed to provide comic relief, but most of the movie provides an unintentional comic tone, so this really isn't necessary. Rebecca Romijn- Stamos plays Joan, the woman who at first glance appears to be nothing less than a second love interest for Castle but finally turns out to be the obligatory person who gives him the inspiring speech that he can choose the course of his own life, and pursue an ordinary, blood free life if he wishes. Naturally, Castle completely discards everything she says and becomes vigilante 'The Punisher' who swears to fight evil and protect the innocent. Right, right, right, we've heard it all before. Just never in such a cheesy fashion.5/10",The Punisher
75,oneguyrambling,"Don't be so quick to write this off, it's better than you think.",7,17 December 2010,"Apart from one baffling and totally infuriating scene (one that was simply lousy and poorly conceived), The Punisher totally defied my initial expectations (that it would suck), and is actually quite good.Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an ex soldier and undercover cop, completing one last job before he leaves the force permanently to spend more time with his family. The job of course goes a little awry and results in the unplanned death of one of the criminals. No biggie, he shouldn't have been a naughty boy in the first place. Only this naughty boy happened to be the son of one Howard Saint (John Travolta) who is a local underworld kingpin and drug-lord. Saint swears revenge on all and sundry and what revenge it is.At the behest of his trophy wife Saint orders the wholesale execution of everyone that ever bought Castle a Christmas present. Luckily for them Castle is attending a family reunion so the bad guys can save petrol, and as requested they drop the entire family, Mum, Dad, cousins, Aunties and Uncles on the spot in cold blood. Castle wife and young son are left for near last for dramatic effect, and after a chase it is obvious that they will not appear in any sequel. Castle himself is left for dead, riddled with holes on a burning dock And this is where the bad guys screw up. Everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE ELSE at the soiree, are left deader than Lindsay Lohan's career, yet they have the primary target at their feet and neglect to put one in his temple just to make sure? Haven't they seen Zombieland? Some mysterious black guy (whose significance I just couldn't get) saves Castle and brings him back to health, and in a cheesy moment Castle just ""happens"" to find his son's T shirt with the Punisher skull logo on it, weeks after the shootings, on the beach.Castle somehow gets back to the US unnoticed and sets about plotting his revenge and hitting the bottle, and not always in that order. He moves into what looks on the outside to be a squatter's residence but inside seems to be fully furnished and well maintained apartments. His neighbours are basically three, a fat guy, an ""alternative"" guy with a bunch of piercings and a chick who might scrub up well after a shower (it's Rebecca Romjin so we know she will).Castle spends a while coming up with a way to ensure his revenge is particularly sweet, and above all convoluted and largely unnecessary seeing as how in the end he still walks into impossible odds with guns blazing. But it seems there were 60 odd minutes of screen time to fill so let's just go with it. The plan involves working through the chain of command up to Saint via his money, business, 2IC and finally his trophy wife.Once the wheels are in motion Castle goes public and more or less tells everyone what's going to happen, but for ages neither the cops or the bad guys seem to be able to find him. When he does show up he invariably ends up killing people yet again no cops can catch him, and the forensic guys obviously don't look that hard for DNA or basic evidence.There is some ""more violent than usual in comic book films"" action, a great one on one stoush involving an indiscreet and frankly monstrous assassin and a pretty funny faux-torture scene (as funny as torture can be I guess).Travolta is a pretty good bad guy in this, largely because I think he is no longer a likable good guy unless you're a middle aged woman with recurring Grease flashbacks, and as Howard Saint he is always angry and seems to be talking with a mouthful of cotton wool. Jane is more efficient than I expected, he is pretty solid and believable in the action and fight scenes, plays the gruff p*ssed off loner well and spits out some pretty good, albeit dry, one liners. The final showdown between Castle and multiple bad guys is very entertaining and sees him exacting the appropriate level of revenge So that's the good bits, but a 7.5 can't be all good.The bad:* - The fat supposed comic-relief neighbour who mimes opera is terrible and annoying.* - In one scene Castle must swerve to avoid the most clichéd reason in cinema, the kid running onto the road chasing a big red ball.* - The cheesy way they decided to shoehorn the Punisher logo into the climax of the film, forced and distracting.The awful:* - A hired assassin comes to kill Castle, only he shows up at the diner where Castle is eating, pulls out a guitar case and sings him a song first!! Worse than terrible - f*cking annoying is more to the point. I squirm every time it comes up and reach for the remote. Removing this scene and opera-miming fat guy and this is an 8.This was a pleasant surprise aside from my above whinges, a low key comic book movie with realistic violence and great character foundation. After all what could be more inspiring than watching everyone that features in your personal photo album being butchered in front of you.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Don't be fooled by your pre-conceived opinions, this is better than you might think.",The Punisher
76,sarastro7,Kinda interesting...,6,19 July 2004,"The Punisher was better than I'd feared, but not as good as I'd hoped. It's an interesting movie, because it had plenty of really good performances, good engrossing emotional content, and an almost too likable lead. Thomas Jane was pretty good in this role. He was a ""soft macho"" guy with an appropriately deep, threatening voice. He starts out as an FBI agent, who emphasizes that killing people is a bad thing. The entire first half of the movie is spent setting us up for the assassination of his family (not just his wife and kid, either, but his parents, and his wife's family), so the pain of his situation is sufficiently believable. The movie does a good job of this - and yet, Jane is never really believable as a cold-blooded killer. He's too nice. Strangely, there isn't much gun-totin' in this movie. The Punisher concentrates his efforts on the specific people (Howard Saint and his criminal operation) responsible for his family's death, and uses cunning plans instead of gun-slingery. He claims it isn't vengeance, but punishment. And while it *is* punishment, it certainly is also pure, emotion-driven revenge.The movie is not much like the comic at all. I haven't read the Punisher comic since 1998, but I gather there were a few nods to the recent stories (such as The Russian), including part of the tone of the film. This is one aspect that is problematic. There is a good deal of comedy in this movie, and it toes an uneasy line with the violence. The violence is not as bad as some would allege - the only really disturbing scene is integral to establishing the supporting characters' loyalty to the protagonist, and so is quite justified. But overall, this Punisher/Frank Castle is never really quite consistent in his attitude, swinging back and forth uneasily between a nice guy and a vigilante assassin out for blood.One of the best things in the movie is the supporting cast, which stylistically are much like they would be in the comic books. My respect for Rebecca Romijn-Stamos has increased ten-fold, as she demonstrates that she can actually act, and in an unglamorous, un-made up role, too. For a long time, I doubted it was even her, because she had somewhat less than supermodel-perfect skin.She and the two guys living in Frank Castle's building are very good characters, because they insist on making Frank their friend, looking past his ""mission"" to get at the genuine person. They sort of convey the revival of Frank's vitality and desire to live, which a lot could (have) be(en) done with, also in eventual sequels.The Punisher ends up doing even worse to Howard Saint than what was done to himself. This is a bit over the top (and not at all like the character's style in the comics), although we don't feel sorry for Saint, who's a complete bastard. Still, Frank Castle's pledge to henceforth pursue crime as ""The Punisher!!"" in the final scene is more comical than intense. Especially now that he's gotten his revenge. It's hard to believe that his heart will be in killing off criminals on a regular basis from now on.Overall, the movie is uneven and could have been better, but it also had some good elements, and the story was coherent and captivating enough for even a comic book fan not to care that it was completely different from its original four-color inspiration. Although it had very little to do with the comic book version, this was a much, much better movie than its nearly unwatchable 1989 predecessor starring a certain Mr. Lundgren.6 out of 10.",The Punisher
77,emasterslake,Another Marvel Comic Movie (woopie freak-in do).,5,5 January 2007,"I'm not entirely familiar with the series this movie is based off of. But I do now after seeing the movie.It all begins with a cop named Frank Castle who's a family man and had to move from place to place due to his ever growing list of enemies. He even has a fake tombstone to make them believe he's dead.Mr. Saint, a Florida Kingpin who wants Castle to suffer the consciences for what Castle's done to his son. So he sends out some hit men to kill off his family including him. But he survived it, and lost everything that meant a lot to him.So he swore revenge on Mr. Saint, and will do it with all the custom made guns and tactics he knows of to get even with the S.O.B.The movie has some good moments to it, including some use of weaponry and fighting skills. But if I was a die hard fan of the comic series, then I would consider it cool. John Travota, was the only actor I could recognize out of the bunch, but he was way better in ""Pulp Fiction"" than this movie.Recommended to the obsess Marvel fans who know it better than me, not recommended to those who have less interest in the comic.",The Punisher
78,mentalcritic,Who's really being punished?,3,29 October 2004,"When X-Men 2 rolled into theaters, I was optimistic that perhaps a new era of comic book adaptations had begun. One where purists and idiotic commercialisations alike were ignored, and a unique, interesting spin was put on the characters. The recent Hulk adaptation left me a little more guarded, but still optimistic. This new version of The Punisher, on the other hand, confirmed all of my worst fears about Hollywood's dearth of ideas.In contrast to the very low-rent 1989 adaptation, sequences in this film were scaled back to the point where they probably look nothing like what the screenwriter had in mind. That would be okay, since the sequences work in their own right, but when you compare this modern, ultra-slick film to one that was made for what amounts to lunch money by comparison, it comes off as very safe and restrained. The sanitisation of Hollywood action is getting to a point where cinephiles are giving up and turning their sights to the Orient. This, in turn, can only be blamed upon the death of the independent studios.Thomas Jane does not make a very convincing Punisher. Were I to meet Dolph Lundgren in a dark alley, I'd be very certain that I was in the last few minutes of my life. When I look at Thomas Jane trying to get the same effect, I start to think that I could kill this guy with a curtain rod. As a result, The Punisher circa 2004 is another adaptation where the titular hero is overshadowed by the villain. In this case, it's even worse, since Batman's Michael Keaton at least knew how to act.One sequence that sums up the film for me is when the Punisher hides in an elevator shaft after being beaten senseless, and does nothing while one of the goons pulls out his neighbors' piercings. Some hero. Adding to the problem is that the earlier fight with the Russian seems totally one-sided. The Russian is utterly wiping the floor with the Punisher until the last moment. Not that I am in favour of a hero that always wins, but I was under the impression that Frank Castle was supposed to be quite a massive guy with impressive combat skills. Thankfully, this is made up for in advance by an earlier assassination attempt. Although it shows the Punisher helplessly struggling to get out of a car, the use of a trick knife to kill the would-be assassin is a highlight.This new film recognises the value of investing time in making its characters seem three-dimensional, in contrast to some other overpublicised adaptations I could mention. As a result, the deaths shown in the film seem more consequential than was the case in the 1989 film, which could have just as easily been retitled Yakuza Holocaust without anyone noticing the difference. The problem is that some of the exposition seems downright silly at times. The attempts on the part of the other squatters to get to know Castle are downright silly, at best. That they actually bond with him is outrageous. The worst thing is that there are constant cuts to them during Castle's fight with the Russian. Again, to draw a comparison to the 1989 version, if this sequence were shot with the same sensibility, it would show Frank Castle and the Russian pounding one another mercilessly. With no breaks, for comic relief or otherwise. And that's the biggest problem here - for a film about a character who has no remorse or hope, this effort just isn't hardcore enough.I gave The Punisher, circa 2004, a three out of ten. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos has appeared in far more compelling comic-book adaptations, and you can often see it in the look on her face. Like its low-budget predecessor, this Punisher just doesn't seem to know how to capitalise on its strengths.",The Punisher
79,jeremycrimsonfox,Underrated Film From Before The MCU,7,19 September 2019,"Frank Castle is not a happy man. He is almost killed by hitmen hired by a crime boss Howard Saint when Frank's final undercover operation results in the death of his son Bobby. But his family is killed in the attack, and when the police and FBI reveal they can't do a thing due to Howard's power and influence, Frank decides that the only person who can deliver justice is himself, and becomes The Punisher, with the aim of getting revenge on Howard and his mob.Yeah, it was not well-received when released, but I sure like it. Said to be done as a throwback to action films from the 60's and 70's, The Punisher is actually a good film. Yes, it can be dark, but that's why it has the R rating, and let me tell you, the rating fits, especially if you read the comic series of the same name. This may be a Marvel movie, but parents beware, The Punisher is not a story about a man getting superpowers and decides to don a full body spandex suit and a mask, this is a story of a man without superpowers, and his dark quest for vengeance.The characters can be hit or miss. Two of Frank's apartment mates, Dave and Bumpo, are there mainly to add comic relief (which is different from their comic book incarnations), but Thomas Jane really nails the part of The Punisher well. However, John Travolta is not a good fit for Howard Saint, the main antagonist.The story is good, as it has a mix of dark and comedic scenes (one comedic scene is where Frank fakes torturing Mickey, a disgruntled member of Saint's mob, in order to get him on his side, as well as Frank's battle with The Russian, who is portrayed by professional wrestler Kevin Nash, who is a good fit for the character). This is an underrated movie that is exciting, and is worth watching at least once.",The Punisher
80,fmarkland32,Bringing the punishment. Too.,6,31 July 2006,"Thomas Jane stars as Frank Castle, who loses his family to viscous mobster John Travolta, who to really leave his mark kills Castle's entire family (Cousins, uncles and in-laws) however when he is the lone survivor of the attack, it is time for punishment served (particularly severed) the coldest way possible. Reading the various comments between people, one saying this version is better or the Dolph Lundgren version is better, the truth is I love them both. Truth is I never read the comics, so I'm indifferent to the lack of faithful material and all that gibberish. When it comes to remakes or updates, you are always obligated to express your opinion on this subject. So I loved them both. However what is striking about this version of The Punisher is just how wonderfully silly and insane the movie is. The fight sequence between ""The Russian"" where opera plays, the way that Castle survives getting shot, stabbed and blown up. It only serves to make this piece of action fun to say the least. This is indeed a fun throwback to the classic 80's actioner such as Commando, Cobra and Death Wish 3. However why I can't give it a rating higher is because there are a couple slow spots, mainly the useless nonsense between Rebecca Romjin, Thomas Jane and her goofy neighbors. Women are generally useless in these type of movies, because they exist only to give our hero a shade of needless humanity that nobody really wants to see. I personally wanted to see more ass-kicking and less banter between Romjin and Jane. Of course that flaw aside, The Punisher works rather well in what it sets out to and by genre standards this is an enjoyable effort. It's just that like all revenge movies, it isn't that deep and the drama people claim works so well, really doesn't do anything that Death Wish didn't do better. In other words it's an action movie and a fairly decent one. I for one loved this and the original 89 version. Both are my guilty pleasures and although both of these seem to get bad reps from critics and fans, there is no denying that these movies work for the genre fan.* *1/2 out of 4-(Pretty good)",The Punisher

82,jon.h.ochiai,Dark Vengeance,8,25 April 2004,"Director Jonathan Hensleigh's adaptation of the Marvel Comic's ""The Punisher"" is surprisingly effective, and has a dark uncompromising tone distinct from the current run of revenge themed motion pictures. In a way this is refreshing, although it is unrelenting in it's cruelty and violence. Hensleigh along with co-writer, Michael France, have updated ""The Punisher"" character. I was somewhat familiar with the comic book character, who first appeared more than 25 years ago. The Punisher is not so much a superhero, rather a man who is driven virtually insane by all consuming vengeance. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is a former Special Forces war hero, who is an undercover agent for the FBI. During an operation John Saint (James Carpinello, who also plays John's twin Bobby) is killed. John is the son of billionaire crime boss, Howard Saint (John Travolta). This is Castle's last operation before accepting a quieter position in a Virginia office. He and his wife Maria (Samantha Mathis) and son Will (Marcus Johns) head for a Castle family reunion. Distraught Livia Saint (Laura Harring) wants her measure of revenge, and orders the death of Castle and his entire family.In a very bloody and cold search and destroy operation lead by Bobby Saint and Howard's second in command, Quentin Glass (Will Patton), they all but accomplish their mission. Frank Castle bravely fights the no win scenario, and witnesses the murder of his wife and young son. Castle is shot point blank in the chest and left for dead in the ocean. The operation is so well orchestrated, it is extremely difficult to believe that Castle survives. Though we know that there would be no vengeance tale without an avenging hero. Miraculously, Castle does survive, and is eventually nursed back to health in what seems to be a land speed record. Castle is now ready to exact his revenge.""The Punisher"" is well contextualized. The story is very linear, and the action and violence are crisp and precise-- the villains die very badly. What really makes ""The Punisher"" work is Thomas Jane as Frank Castle. Physically, Jane has the chiseled body and expertly dispatches his enemies. Jane has a commanding presence, and he captures the tortured and doused soul of Castle which makes his cause strangely empathetic. Jane's Castle has lost everything, and does not care if he forfeits his own life. He tells his neighbor, Joan (a good and under utilized Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) when she asks him what makes him so different from the men he wants to kill, ""They have something to lose."" John Travolta as Howard Saint is a capable adversary, but as captivating as his performance is, it is just over the top. His Saint needed to be more calculated evil than crazed evil to offset the sheer dark will of Jane's Castle.""The Punisher"" is brutally dark and unrelenting. Thomas Jane may be the new action star. His performance as Frank Castle reminded me of what made the John Rambo character in ""First Blood"" so enrolling before that storyline went completely awry. Here is a man willing to die for a cause, and for whom everything worth living for has long been extinguished-- life and death as a paradox.",The Punisher
83,stamper,Moving in the right direction,7,10 February 2005,"With The Punisher Jonathan Hengsleigh has moved from his writing desk to the seat behind the camera and the only thing I can say that he has done well. Not only is The Punisher the best action flick of 2004, it also is 'old-school' action, like back in the 80's when Schwarzenegger used to kick major buttocks.Mentioning 'old school' action films of the 80's immediately brings me to a possible point of criticism regarding the film, namely the acting and the lack of story and on and on. What most people do not seem to understand, is that an action film like this is actually meant to have only a superficial storyline (revenge) and that it is not mandatory for the actors to put on Oscar worthy performances. The important thing in a film like this is, that the characters are believable, that the plot is acceptable, that the action is good and that the dialog is not too corny. When you actually see it like that, the film does pretty good. The only thing I felt that slacked a little was the dialog, or rather the monologue, by 'The Punisher' towards the end. But then again every film has it's flaws and so does this one. Another thing I really didn't get was the fact that there was NO blood near Castle's dead son and wife. COME ON!!! Bearing in mind the way they died and the fact this was a brutal film, I cannot imagine why there was no blood on the scene. That's pretty unbelievable and I didn't like it one bit. In the end though, there were much more things, I liked than disliked in this film. What I liked very much in this film, was that Frank Castle wasn't just some dumb guy going around and shooting everybody (like in the 1989 version), but that he actually had a brain and made some elaborate plans to get his revenge. I also liked the bad guys a lot, the most memorable of those being Mrs.Saint, who was so so brutally cold, when coming from the funeral, it made my eyes fill up with tears. Another thing that made the film enjoyable to me, was the fact that there was ample action and excitement and enough brutal violence to enjoy for everyone around, making it a film worthy of bearing the title ACTION FLICK. I know that some of you out there won't like this for various reason, but when you're out to see some good old fashioned action Arnold Schwarzenegger style, give this one a try and I guarantee you'll enjoy it, for it is MUCH better than the 1989 version starring Dolph Lundgren (getting a 6 out of 10 from me). The only thing I missed was the monologue: 'Listen up god, if you really exist...'!!! Maybe they'll use it in The Punisher 2 and if they do, I hope they get 'An eye for an Eye' by Sodom into the film, because it features that monologue.7 out of 10",The Punisher
84,eminkl,"If you can sit through it, you should consider yourself duly punished.",1,1 September 2019,"The Punisher is such a bad film that it becomes inadvertently entertaining; it's enough to make you pine for the original version of the black-clad Marvel Comics' badass, played to awful imperfection in 1989 by Dolph Lundgren. This second attempt is much more fully developed, or, at least, has better firearms and some of the most daringly insipid comic moments ever committed to an action film. You'll never look at operatic pasta preparation in the same way again. Strapping, lantern-jawed Thomas Jane (Deep Blue Sea) plays Frank Castle, an undercover FBI agent who pulls off that ever-ill-advised ""one last job,"" which accidentally results in the demise of the son of criminal kingpin Howard Saint (Travolta, rivaling his Battlefield Earth performance for sheer, blustery badness). Things then escalate into the slaughter of Castle's entire extended family. Donning the skull-emblazoned logo T-shirt his young son gave him moments before being run down by Saint's thugs, arming himself to the teeth and then some, and, finally, slamming down a few gallons of Wild Turkey, Castle embarks on a seriously vicious rampage of revenge (or, as he notes in his five-point plan of action, ""punishment"") and begins to eliminate Saint's people, one by bloody one. He takes up residence in the seedy part of Tampa (and that's ""Tampa, Florida,"" as the subtitles make sure to inform, just in case anyone might have mistaken the sun-drenched shores for Tampa, Maine) and falls in with a new ""family"" made up of a winningly sweet ex-junkie (Romijn-Stamos) and her 12-steppin' pals, equips himself with a very nice and highly modified GTO, and generally begins to behave like a Warren Oates character on PCP. ""Vaya con dios, amigo - go with God,"" offers one character regarding Castle's family massacre. Castle's muzzle-fire reply? ""God's gonna sit this one out."" Oh, yeah, baby, it is to laugh. Jane, who speaks with the bizarre delivery of Highlander's Christopher Lambert (he sounds poorly dubbed even though he isn't), plays this broad vendetta of a character ramrod straight, which turns The Punisher into an overwrought, melodramatic comedy. It doesn't help matters that the script, from Hensleigh and Michael France, has more holes in it than all of its corpses put together, and never misses an opportunity to milk any bad action cliché. And then there's the issue of the film's maddening and repeated homages to George Miller's Mad Max - the sequence featuring the death of Castle's wife and son is an exacting re-creation of the same scene in Miller's vastly superior (and equally grim) film, as is this film's final act of explosive vengeance. It's all well and good to have homages in your films - credit where credit is due and all that - but Hensleigh's quotes feel more like blatant theft. The worldview of this particular Marvel character has always been excessively dark: He's a righteous force of nature in much the same vein as novelist Andrew Vachss' cold-steel Burke, especially in his interactions with his new streetwise family, but whereas Vachss chilly killer knows he's damaged goods, Castle just comes off like a dangerous nutjob, especially as Jane plays him. But - and let's be honest here - The Punisher is big fun, in the sense that I laughed almost until I wept, a cathartic experience if ever there were one.

85,gregsrants,Rountine vigilantism on line with 80's Stallone films,4,18 April 2004,"The Punisher has the unique offering of what I thought was one of the best lines in corny action films in the past year.  Nick Castle (a.k.a. The Punisher) is given encouragement by a local who simply wishes the God be with him.  In a stern and unemotional response, Castle leers back at him and says, `God is going to sit this one out.'  Ouch!  I was first introduced to the Punisher via a Marvel Comic book back in the 1980's.  The Amazing Spider-Man #201 to be exact.  The Punisher was an enigma to the superhero universe.  He was mean and unrelenting in his punishment.  Death surrounded him and shared no love for other crime fighters.  In issue #201 he meets Spider-Man and shoots him two pages later. He showed no remorse and went on his crusade detailing his days in his personal log.  In short The Punisher was the anti-hero.  He had a cause, but laws that protected the criminals were the same laws he ignored in his pursuit. The film version (at least the 2004 entry) stays true to this character. Thomas Jane (Dreamcatchers) plays Nick Castle, the F.B.I. agent and father who's family is gunned down by gangster Howard Saint (played wonderfully by John Travolta) who himself is seeking punishment for the death of his youngest son.  When Castle recovers from his wounds sustained while trying to protect his family, he sets out on a self proclaimed mission of vengeance on all those involved.  His vigilantism would leave countless dead, a crime boss suspecting everyone in his family and operation is conspiring and city blocks literally left in ruins. The Punisher was made once before.  In 1989 Dolph Lundgren starred in the title role with Lou Gossett Jr. in a film that sparked not one memory from this critic when posting this review. Now, fifteen years later, this new edition might not fair any better in the memory banks.And that is too bad, for everyone involved in the film deserves a better fate.  Thomas Jane embodies everything that the Punisher is about.  He is not overly muscular, but can carry a fight; he is rugged but can also blend into a crowd.  John Travolta is also exceptional as the evil mobster, Saint. Travolta seems to have more fun being the bad guy and his roles in Basic, Swordfish and Face/Off are some of the better villain roles this side of Die Hard's Hans Gruber.  Too bad he decided to opt for Lucky Numbers and Battlefield Earth to help pay for the fuel in his private jet fleet.The problem with The Punisher is that it offers absolutely nothing new to the genre.  Like any Schwarzenegger or Stallone film of the 1980's, this was simply a revenge film with better explosions.  It was like a cross between Stallone's Cobra and Bronson's Death Wish, two movies that I have drunk repeatedly in hopes of forgetting.   Even the most uttered line in payback films `If you kill them, what makes you better than them' is thrown in to remind us how routine the movie plays out.  Granted, that is still better than when Castle proclaims, `You want peace? Prepare for war!' or when Saint explains to his son that his mother `Took the train' thus referring to the fact he threw her in front of a locomotive just moments earlier.Even the secondary characters added for comic relief are awful.  Not the actors mind you, but the fact that you can see why they were in the film and know when they will come in handy miles before Castle does.  This film is so formulaic that it makes Hellboy look like the Sixth Sense. 
I don't know if I can fully blame director Jonathon Hensleigh for this mess. He had written Die Hard with a Vengeance and Armageddon, but had yet to try his chops behind the camera until now.  As a first timer, I think he did the best with what the limited script gave him.  The feel of the film is downbeat and the violence is well choreographed even if people keep getting shot or hit with machete like objects without much blood spewing from their wounds.I guess the good thing is that The Punisher doesn't push back the super hero movement as much as a film like The Hulk and Daredevil did a year ago.  It stays fairly true to the book even if this particular story was week.  It's just too bad that the movie did nothing to up the ante for future comic book adaptations.  If The Punisher ends up being successful at the box office, it may just open the door to other heroes like Ghost Rider or Moon Knight that might be easily assembly lined into our local multi-plex without a consideration for a script or enjoyable characters.www.gregsrants.com",The Punisher

87,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Much better than the 1990 version,8,4 January 2006,"Frank Castle, a government agent, completes a sting operation during an illegals weapons sale and in doing so the son of Howard Saint, a ruthless Miami mobster, is killed. The bust was Castle's last job and he leaves the service and goes to a family reunion in the Caribbean, but unknown to him, Saint has tracked him and sends out hit men who massacre Castles entire family - wife, child, parents, cousins, everyone. Then they shoot and leave him for dead and The Punisher, a vigilante that is a force to be reckoned with, is born.Director Jonathan Hensleigh has changed the story around from the original comic book. Many changes were for budget reasons, but also updates in time to bring the story into the present (2004ish) and not the 1970s when the Punisher originally debuted with Marvel. However, the ruthless spirit of a powerful avenger is here and Thomas Jane fits the part almost perfectly with his almost John McClane approach to the role making a believable hero: one that is tough as nails, but critically not invincible. One who uses his brain as much as his brawn, and gets himself out of outrageous situations with his lethal array of weapons: spring loaded knives, grenades, stashed guns, assault rifles, and the list goes on. However avid readers of the long running comic book may find the film tame in comparison, but as far as comic book adaptations go this is one of the best recent ones right up there with SpiderMan.Dolph Lundgren's 1990 version still has some merits, but this film is better in almost every respect. Most notably, in this film, the title hero actually has his infamous skull shirt, and the storyline is drawn much more directly from the original comics. 8/10Rated R: strong violence, brutality, and profanity.",The Punisher

89,tomimt,It has its moments,5,10 March 2005,"I haven't seen that first Punisher movie with Dolph Lundgren, so I cannot make comparison between these two, so I can't say was this movie any better.First of all this movie has very poor script. It's just far too regular guy's family gets killed, guy want's his revenge kind of story. There is nothing really surprising in the story. And for other thing director didn't obviously know did he wanted to do an action flick or straight forwarded action comedy. Now the whole thing is a bit awkward mixture of over acted drama and clumsy jokes.So, action? Well, it as okay, I've seen worse. My main score for this comes solely from the action and explosions. They were actually very entertaining, but none the less, it doesn't remove the fact, that this movie should have been much, much shorter than it is now.So, small summary: bad acting, bad script but okay action. Sure. If that's your thing, watch it. You might like it.",The Punisher
90,gigan-92,A Bad-Ass Revenge Film,10,15 March 2012,"I have not seen the 1989 original Dolph Lundrgen Punisher film, but I have the seen the two recent movies. Between this one and ""Punisher: War Zone"" I can without a doubt say this one is far superior. Put it this way, if you enjoyed ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" then you will probably enjoy this movie. People would probably argue that the comparison is blasphemy, seeing as the Tarantino film (like most of his work) is based on pastiches to the genres few are familiar with these days. Outside film buffs, you ask the average mainstream movie goer if they know what a 'spaghetti western' is or if they've even seen ""Lady Snowblood"" 91973), two things that had major influences on Tarantino's work and most wouldn't have a clue.This film pays tribute to those genres in a similar sense that Tarantino does. For example, watch this movie and Clint Eastwood's ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976) back-to-back and there are a startling number of similarities. In a quite bad-ass fashion, this film plays out like an old revenge-themed western (""For a Few Dollars More""). Note the shoot out scenes that even employ the classic quick draw approach. Of course, it also is a treat because the dark humor, exemplified in that great fight with 'The Russian'.To add to this, the acting was actually pretty awesome. John Travolta isn't bad as the villain either, quite entertaining.Thomas Jane IS Frank Castle, and he perfectly portrayed the pain of the character. In this movie the writing does a spectacular job at making this character human, and that's the charm of it. This is helped along by Carlo Siliotto, the magnificent composer. Director Jonathan Hensleigh definitely maintains the emotion and macabre atmosphere of the comics I must say, aiming for story instead of just action, which is what makes an action film more than just an action film. The 2008 film way off with this sad to say.I heard critics say it was too dark for the superhero genre, but that's what I liked about it. What I wanted was a sequel, not a bullsh*t re-make.",The Punisher
91,ctomvelu-1,"What's not to like, except maybe for the very end",7,6 December 2008,"This second stab (pun intended) at THE PUNISHER comic book character comes off pretty well, with Tom Jane convincing as a brooding psychopath, recently returned from the dead, who seeks to root out and annihilate his enemies. Frank Castle is an undercover fed who inadvertently causes the death of a crime king's son during a drug bust. The kingpin, played way over the top by John Travolat, then wipes out Castle's family in return. Castle then goes after the kingpin and his family. Not the greatest plot, but the movie surprisingly is heavy on character development as Castle, who was supposed to have died, moves into a decrepit apartment building with some really colorful characters, including the luscious Rebecca Romijn as a troubled woman hiding from life. The tenderhearted tenants work to save Castle from himself and in fact end up saving his life at their peril. The violence is comic book-ish and probably at its best when Castle must beat down an over-sized Russian contract killer. who proceeds to tear down half of Castle's building as they battle. The ending, with Castle finally getting the kingpin, is awesomely stupid, but up until then, it's been one hell of a ride on the dark side. Not to be missed.

X-Men's Rebecca Romijin-Stamos co-stars as the lovely restaurant owner who befriends Frank, there's some good action sequences with plenty of gory violence and dark humor as well.It's a more gritter adaptation of a Marvel comic along with the ""Blade"" series and less then ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"", ""Hulk"" or ""Iron Man"".

93,dr_foreman,shamed by Dolph!,3,20 April 2004,"*Teeny-weeny minor spoilers follow*This movie has above a 6.0?  Oh, come on, boys...I hate to say it, but the campy Dolph Lundgren version was better.  The new Punisher is surprisingly boring and cheap; note that its budget is too low for great spectacle, and too high to allow for enjoyable cheese.  It's also ultra-violent, tedious, and curiously lacking in action.  The early ""beach party massacre"" scene is drawn-out and sadistic, as is the piercing-plucking scene later on.  And where are all the epic gunfights?  We get one or two decent Western-style shootouts in the midst of a desert of boring ""plot"" scenes.  I still got my fair share of laughs, particularly when the Punisher would do some inexplicable toughguy thing - like whip out a compound bow when a gun with a silencer would do just as well.  I also liked the fight with the Russian (though God only knows what was in that pot the Punisher tosses at him!).  But a few fun ""so bad it's good"" moments do not add up to a great comic book film.The crazy roommates?  C'mon!  Have you ever heard such fluffy tripe as the lines that are forced into the mouth of the former Mrs. Stamos?  Why is it that, in all these stupid revenge movies, there's always some tedious windbag who has to wax poetic about the shallowness of exacting vengeance? Give it a rest, love; I bet revenge is pretty sweet!Where's Microchip?  The Kingpin?  Jigsaw?  ANYTHING I recognize from the comic?  Instead of a tough super villain, we get Travolta acting all wimpy and whiny.  None of the bad guys are formidable (save the aforementioned Russian); the Punisher gets his revenge very, very easily.The cheesy old Punisher movie can be thoroughly enjoyed if you're in a silly mood; this version can only be goggled at as you wonder, ""what the Hell were they thinking?""So, do you think they'll make another one in 2021?  Maybe the third time will be the charm...",The Punisher
94,Mr_Sensitive,It Was Bad.,3,28 June 2007,"For me The Punisher was the well below disappointment. It consists of everything that makes it a C Grade movie. The only things that make this not a C Grade action movie were the name of the classic book – The Punisher.Synopsis: After his whole family was slaughter by the mob family, Castle an ex secret agent takes matter upon himself to make sure everyone get paid for what they did.Oh my god!!!! I’m couldn’t believe my eye as how horrible this movie is. It was like watching 70s’ Hong Kong movie and all they do is fight and take revenge and have no absolute storyline. The story suppose to be simple but not this simple, this is just ridiculous story with added some unnecessary scenes and characters.The work of director is worst than that of college dropout film student. His direction is absolutely pathetic, many first times director did it badly but not this bad especially with high profile movie. The wardrobe is horrible, the score doesn’t go well with the scene, the dialogue is unacceptable, the location is boring, the acting is just average, and the story can be very boring. Even the humors are also stiff.The only good thing about the movie got to be the casting of the big name actors. Though, I still preferred someone with more roughness and more crude face than Thomas Jane, but he is still fine. I have to bravo for the casting of Laura Harring, she is hot and probably the only thing that keep you watching this turd.Lastly, if it wasn’t for the name The Punisher this would have never made into the movie or at the most straight to DVD form. And though people love it causes it very violent for comic movie that is ridiculous reason why this movie is good.Recommendation: At the most catch it if it free.Reason to Watch: Laura Harring in Lingerie.Reason Not To: It only lasted few second.Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F).Please Rate (Y/N) After Read.",The Punisher
95,cariart,"Gritty, Low-Tech Action Film that Works...",8,11 January 2006,"Audiences have become so accustomed to being overloaded by CGI effects in recent comic book adaptations that the idea of a tougher, leaner approach seemed to catch viewers and critics off-guard, when this latest adaptation of ""The Punisher"" premiered. Sadly, most critics chose to ignore the very qualities that made this film so special, never accepting that the story is closer in spirit to ""Sin City"" than ""Spider-Man"" or ""Daredevil"". Now that the film is available on DVD, I invite everyone to take a second look at this dark tale of the fine line one man walks between Justice and Vengeance...you may be surprised by how good it really is! The film is carefully constructed to allow viewers an opportunity to see dedicated undercover cop Frank Castle in action, and to understand the caring, loving family man Frank Castle was...before mob boss Howard Saint, and his equally ruthless wife, Livia (played by a remarkably low-key John Travolta and Laura Harring), takes vengeance for their son's death by ordering the brutal execution of Castle's entire family. As conceived, with total conviction, by Thomas Jane, Castle is so completely traumatized that he 'lets go' of what remained of his compassion, and becomes a human weapon, devoid of pity, living only to see justice done, in equal measure to the crime.This is not someone you can easily 'warm up' to, and as the movie evolves into a series of executions, you may actually start to feel more sympathy toward the Saints and their henchman, Quentin Glass (the ever-watchable Will Patton) than in Castle. But screenwriter Michael France, and co-writer and director Jonathan Hensleigh, both well-versed in the Marvel comic character, add three quirky 'innocents' (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ben Foster, and John Pinette), who Castle warms up to, somewhat, and must ultimately protect. He will never recover the compassion that he lost, but he realizes that for many being brutalized, he is the only hope they have, giving him a purpose to live for.Unlike the earlier, Dolph Lundgren ""Punisher"", hampered by a minuscule budget and two-dimensional acting, this version makes the most of its small budget, with first-class acting (including a VERY welcome cameo by Roy Scheider), incredible stunt and pyrotechnic work, and a storyline that offers far more depth than you might expect in a comic book adaptation.I sincerely hope a sequel is made, as this will be a film that will grow in stature as audiences realize how good it actually is!",The Punisher

97,departed07,"A very good comic book movie, but it won't appeal to everybody.",8,10 March 2008,"You have to be a true comic book or superhero fan to watch movies like The Punisher since many fans are familiar with characters that never killed people but leave them hanging for the cops to be taken away. The Punisher is a very different character since he kills people after doing bad things.Thomas Jane is the title character in which he's Frank Castle, a special ops fighter who knows the tricks along with knowing various techniques on how to fight and use weapons of all kinds. Not only is he a devoted worker, but also a family man until one day a group of thugs go to his private home and kill everybody in his family where only Frank stays alive despite almost breathing his last breath.After getting better, he goes by the name of Punisher where he goes after the enemies, including the main boss of the gang, Howard Saint (John Travolta) who's responsible for murdering Frank's wife and child. He also hides out in a crummy apartment complex where he befriends a beautiful/battered waitress (Rebecca Rojimn), a skinny computer nerd (Ben Foster) and a fat guy.With The Punisher being the third rated R movie in the new Marvel franchise (Blade and Blade II are the first two), the film is also very violent in terms of our main character seeking vendetta. Some scenes will make you laugh while others will make you close your eyes.This is a very good comic book movie for fans of either the Marvel industry or just the character itself.

The protagonist is Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), a federal agent who kills the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), a money launderer. It is Saint's wife Livia (Laura Harring)who gives the cold order to wipe out not only Castle, but his entire family. We soon witness hired gunmen savagely wiping out Castle's entire family, including his wife (Samantha Mathis)and son. Castle manages to survive his assault, and starts his journey on the path of revenge. When he's not busy destroying the fabric of Saint's life (Such as causing Saint to believe that his wife is being unfaithful with his right-hand man Quentin Glass, played by Will Patton), he spends time getting liquored up at the rooming house that he's inhabiting. Drawing him out of his isolation are the tenants of the house, including Rebecca Romijn as Joan. However, Castle, a.k.a. The Punisher is a dark figure, revenge spurring him into action. And he won't rest until Saint is destroyed.There is a lot of action in the film, and the performances from Jane and Travolta are riveting. There are some spots that slightly drag, and many implausible plot points (Why would Saint allow his wife to keep going out without a guard, considering that Castle is destroying him?).Otherwise, this is a pretty good rock 'em, sock 'em film that will keep you busy on a weekend.",The Punisher
100,Flagrant-Baronessa,Old-school,7,30 October 2006,"Producers and distributors alike can try to market this as a superhero movie all they want but the fact is that at the end of the day The Punisher is an action movie  no more, no less. That is not to say it is a bad achievement, for the end product is fun, exhilarating and stylish. I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.Although The Punisher is adapted from Marvel Comics, the R-rating alone should be blunt indicator of the path it intends to take. Half an hour into the film it still leaves us clueless and oblivious to the dark turn it will twist into. During which Thomas Jane undergoes an apt transformation of character from heartfelt family man on that one last undercover op to a hard-boiled, brooding vigilante who downs whiskey, swears, tortures and broods. The catalyst for this development is the brutal murder of his family and now he's out to get the hierarchy of villains (headed by John Travolta)  only he isn't just out for vengeance or justice  he's out to punish. In a corrupt city of thugs, Frank Castle becomes the judge, jury and executor.What is so refreshing about Thomas Jane in the part of Punisher is that he is a sprawling surge of old school with a splash of Clint Eastwood protagonist  the detached, effortless action hero who is too cool for romantic interests, with hardcore one-liners and a merciless approach to duels. In this way, he is easily one of the most successful 'superhero' actors of the new millennium. But alas, Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this off-beat, old-school style to acting and action.I also want to comment on said action, which was spectacular. Truth to be told, I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory ""the visuals are stunning"" or ""it's extremely fast-paced and kinetic"" but here the sheer hand-to-hand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman, Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty, graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the $33,000,000 budget went. Did they spend it all on late night taco runs?For that matter, The Punisher is far from devoid of faults. Its fatal flaw stems, in part, from what made it a good film in the first place: its sparseness of effects, general minimalism and lack of superhero formula. Rather it is a model-kit assembled from seedy old-school revenge action movies, the type you'd sort of casually catch a bit of on TV one night. 7 out of 10",The Punisher
101,Rautus,Very good adaptation,10,20 April 2007,"I've seen both Punisher versions and they're both good this one is a little more closer to the Marvel Comic, he stays in an apartment with a load of weapons at his disposal just like the comic and the PS2 game. His shirt does have the Skull symbol on it making it a little more closer to the comic.The action takes a little longer to get going than the 1989 Punisher film but we do get a chance to see Frank Castle getting his weapons, placing traps in his apartment, getting to know his neighbours and secretly collapsing Howard Saint's empire by making it look like his wife is cheating on him and destroying his business.The actions are pretty good like when The Punisher's fighting the Russian and when he assaults Howard Saint's building.

103,christian123,An Entertaining Revenge Flick,5,21 November 2004,"Based on the popular Marvel Comics character, The Punisher is Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), a former military man working as an undercover agent for the FBI. When his family is killed by the mob as payback for his last job for the government, he goes on a vengeful rampage against them.Generic story aside, The Punisher is still a very enjoyable revenge film. It is a little over the top on the violence but it never becomes too ridiculous or disgusting. I have never read any of the comics so I can't say if this is a faithful adulteration. I can say that the film is likable even if you have never read the comic books. About the actual film, the main character is very strong and he has a nice image. The whole film is very stylish and it just looks and feels creepy. It has a nice atmosphere that fits the story so well. Director Jonathan Hensleigh did a good job at that but the story isn't as good as the style. It's weak, generic and by the numbers so this keeps the movie from really breaking out.The acting is pretty average, nothing really notable or interesting. Thomas Jane looks intimidating as The Punisher but his performance is pretty dull. It is kind of the point but it just doesn't make for an interesting hero. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos was okay again nothing special. John Travolta was a complete joke as Howard. I used to respect him as an actor and he has made some pretty good movies. However, his performance here is very weak and it's hard to take him seriously as an actor.The action scenes are violent yet still watch able. They don't break any new ground but they should keep the audience entertained. The film's running time is a long 124 minutes. To say the least, this film could have been edited. There were too many slow spots and pointless scenes. There were some pointless subplots that went nowhere as well as some pointless characters. Some people may also not like the film because the main character isn't really a hero. It may be difficult to root for someone like The Punisher since he isn't very likable. Ultimately, The Punisher is still a better film than Man on Fire and it does make a decent revenge film. In the end, the film is pretty generic but it's still a slick action film that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10",The Punisher
104,theshadow908,Good comic book movie.,8,27 June 2006,"The Punisher tells the story of FBI agent Frank Castle.

Now Castle's out for a little revenge of his own, as the deadly Punisher, a vigilante willing to go where the law won't. This is a very well made, action packed film, and it sticks close to the source material.This version of The Punisher may suit fans of the comic better than the original film with Dolph Lundgren, because it sticks more to the source material. Scenes from the comic are actually used in this movie, that's how close it is. The movie is well paced with a good blend of action and humour, which always makes a comic book movie good. The characters are cool and original, like their cinematic versions breathed new life into them.The acting is pretty good. Tom Jane is great as The Punisher. It's like he stepped right off the comics page. Rebecca Romijn, Ben Foster, and John Pinette are perfect in their roles as Castle's outcast neighbours. The only acting job I had a problem with was John Travolta, who I usually like, but in this he hammed it up way too much.Overall, this is one of the better comic book films, and doesn't deserve the bad reputation some people give it.8/10",The Punisher
105,Scars_Remain,A Very Good Marvel Adaptation,8,11 May 2008,"I saw this movie for the first time a few years ago when I came out and didn't think it was that great and said I wouldn't sit through it again and that one time was enough. However, after seeing Iron Man last week I've been meaning to revisit a lot of Marvel's films. I did that tonight with The Punisher and found that I enjoyed it a lot more this time around as it is action packed and all around bad ass.Thomas Jane is awesome as Frank Castle and very disappointed that he won't be returning for the sequel. The rest of the cast is pretty good too. I usually hate John Travolta but I guess since he's an arrogant jerk, he fit the role pretty well so I can't complain. The story was really good and a nice adaptation that stuck pretty well to the original comic books. I also thought the effects were fantastic. I was pleasantly surprised with this one this evening.Marvel fans need to check this film out. It's an awesome revenge film!",The Punisher
106,Danny_G13,Best comic book adaptation I've seen,9,6 August 2005,"The last comic book adaptation I saw was Fantastic Four. This one knocks the stuffing out of that popcorn yarn.Not quite sure why this gets an average rating here, it's a cut above its peers.Tom Jane is Frank Castle, an FBI agent who successfully pulls off his last major job and looks forward to retiring and spending time with his family. However, the last mission he carried out sees consequent revenge being metted out on his own family, and the rest of the story follows him trying to 'punish' those responsible.The Punisher is not like the other comic book adaptations like FF, X Men, Spider Man et al as this one is specifically dark and very violent and subsequently adult based. Much like Sin City, this is away from the fluffy side of Marvel comics and more towards the grimmer bowels of them.Given it is a tale of revenge there's really no need further need for synopsis, but rather focus should be on what the movie has, or has not to offer.First of all this is a Gale Anne Hurd film. A major player in Hollywood behind the entire Terminator series, Hurd's influence on this movie cannot be underestimated. The darkness and foreboding is very much from the Terminator school, and while that was James Cameron direct influence as director, Hurd wasn't sitting ildly by.The direction here comes from Jonathan Hensleigh who moves things along extremely well and one thing he has in his repertoire is things are directed clearly - there is no confusion here about what is going on, and even quicker sequences which usually baffle in such movies are pretty intuitive.As Castle, Jane has just the right lack of charisma; this isn't a character who goes around charming people, quite the opposite. Before Castle's 'death' he plays the role with enough subtlety to avoid him coming across like a robot, but after it he *is* the punisher and is good in the part.The soundtrack is suitably punchy with a nice mix of classical and modern thrown in. The crunchy metal goes well with the fight scenes, and the more gentle overtones apply elsewhere, except one fight which unquestionably has amusing overtones and an opera soundtrack accompanying it.And this is another strength of the film; there is downright superb comedy a-plenty here. It's never overplayed, and the movie *does* take itself necessarily seriously, but there are many genuinely funny moments which provide a great antidote to the darker themes.John Travolta was another master-stroke here; comes across as a really cold villain, whose wife (Equally evil) has him wrapped around her little finger. He is never a parody of a movie villain, and although the ultimate outcome is pretty predictable, it is still enjoyable to see his fate.Overall this is a fine film and never cheesy. It entertains, it has adult violence, it's even amusing in places. A thoroughly enjoyable romp.",The Punisher
107,CelluloidRehab,"I'm sorry. Will the ""real"" Punisher, please stand up ......",2,10 February 2005,"My 75th review has to be a dud. I apologize and hope to have a better movie to review for my 100th review. Now to the movie.Frank Castle is an FBI agent, decorated war hero, etc. For his last undercover assignment as an FBI agent (before retiring), the son of the local Tampa crime boss (Howard Saint) is killed in a botched raid/arrest. Frank celebrates by going to Puerto Rico for a family reunion. Saint hires some thugs to kill Frank and his family. I don't mean just his wife and son, I mean his entire family (mom, dad, second cousin Steve, etc). The rest of the movie is a seesaw of revenge feats.Unfortunately, reading some of the other commentary made me wonder if I had seen the same movie. I can appreciate the ""so-bad-they're-good-movies"", however, this is not one of them. First of all the movie is entirely too long and tries (vainly) to be more than an action movie. This is the Punisher we're talking about. I expected less dialog and pointless character development and more of a body count.I realize that having read the Punisher (volumes 2-6) and the Punisher War Journal could have given me an unbiased view. I don't agree, however. I understand that movies are not page for page recreations of the source, but rather an interpretation. This Frank Castle is a poor one. This movie has Frank Castle as a feeling man (who is a developing alcoholic, with suicidal tendencies ????) dealing with the loss of his entire family. The ""real"" Punisher is not a man, he is more of an entity (as Ghost Rider is the spirit of vengeance, Frank Castle is self contained fury). The death of his family was only the spark for what was already in him. He kills because he must, because it is his nature. Revenge was the initial motivation to get him past the various social, conscious and subconscious barriers. This movie Punisher is not the same person. This is evident in the way he kills people. There are numerous instances of fast draw duels. The Punisher isn't Gary Cooper. He's more like Swarzennegger without the accent and with much less talking (think of the original Terminator).I like the attempt at keeping with the Palmiotti Punisher : 1) The run down apartments with Joan, Spackler Dave and Bumpo , 2) the fight with the Russian assassin (Kevin Nash's scene is the best scene of the whole movie), and 3) the story arc in general (in the comic, Frank takes out a whole mob family but it is not related to the death of his family). I like the inclusion of small details like the projectile knife and the skull shirt. However, Frank doesn't use the Kevlar version of his shirt until the last 10 minutes. Moreover, the bad guys are just incompetent. They could have killed Frank at the very beginning, if they just took a little more pride in their work. Not to mention, TAMPA ???? TAMPA ??? That is a downgrade.Unfortunately, this movie made me wish for the old Punisher. Dolph ... where are you ?? That movie was garbage, and this movie is dull and boring. At least that movie didn't have any aspirations of being anything more than a B-class action movie. Skip this one. If you want the Punisher, go to your local comic shop or pick up The Punisher game.",The Punisher
108,bluesman-20,Si vas pace para bellium. If you want peace prepare for war.,10,8 February 2010,Thomas Jane's portrayal of the Punisher is right out of the comic book. Dark Humorless driven The Punisher is not meant to be funny That's up to his supporting cast. However the one complaint I have with the film is they changed his origin Why? They also Changed Frank Castle the man and in doing so altered the film in such a way it loses it's relationship with the original marvel hero. But the film works Hensleigh delivers a power bomb of a film it packs a punch and it entertains. If I wasn't a fan of The Punisher maybe the film would've gotten less from me then the rating I did give it of ten. Travolta comes thru hamming it up every chance he gets and creating a merciless enemy in his Howard saint. Will Patton is superb in a thankless job playing the sidekick to the main villain. but his Quenton Glass Sparkles with a sadistic gleam and he helps drive the plot forward. But the film rightfully belongs to Thomas Jane he is creates a Punisher struggling with his humanity and knowing what he has to do and slowly turning his back on every thing he's ever known to Punish the gulity. Good movie Good effort true Punisher fans will not be disappointed. And if you're not a fan this movie might make you a fan of the Punisher.,The Punisher
109,troyputland,Bad acting and loose story line filled with meager action.,4,27 July 2015,"Before Marvel Studios had even decided to create their infamous Cinematic Universe, a handful of superhero films were made, including The Punisher, starring Thomas Jane and John Travolta. The film's opening 20 minutes are its strongest. The slaying of FBI agent Frank Castle's (Jane) family is brutal. A lethal businessman (Travolta) gets revenge on Castle for the death of his son by wiping out everyone he loves. Castle goes off the rails, either killing those in his path, or staying distant from others that show compassion. The Punisher's loose story is filled up with bangs, crashes and wallops. Jane's a placid front-man, unable to hide behind an unemotional character. Travolta fairs less well, exuding a comical villain instead of a terrifying one. The Punisher feels like an average action movie, not a notorious comic book adaption.",The Punisher
110,joeyford-55342,The best Punisher,10,30 December 2020,"Yes, this is the best version of the Punisher! And a great villain. Perfect",The Punisher
111,ExpendableMan,Violence is golden,8,22 January 2005,"If somebody were to tell you this were a comic book movie, what would you first imagine? Obviously, the Punisher is going to be recognisable to long term fans but anyone who is unaware of his background at all could be easily mistaken if their principal thoughts were of another pretty boy superhero leaping from buildings wearing spandex, but this is an entirely different beast.In truth, it has more in common with 80's vigilante movies like the Death Wish series than the likes of Spiderman. The lead character, ex-FBI agent Frank Castle, played here by Thomas Jane, takes on the mantle of the Punisher, a one man army taking on a Florida crime lord (Travolta) after his family are senselessly butchered after a drugs bust gets out of hand. From here on in, the film is remorselessly bloody.Flick knives, shotguns, longbows, plastic explosives, bowie knives and various household implements come into play as Castle unleashes his arsenal. Thankfully, while the film is violent though, it resists the urge to flip into bullet time and have characters doing Kung Fu every five minutes, unlike some of it's competition. Quite a few aspects of the comic are also brought to life on screen, such as Castle's substitute family he forms out of the oddballs living in his new apartment block, or the hulking, physical presence of the Russian, a seemingly indestructible hit-man. In fact, my only major gripe with the movie is that the Russian does not play a bigger role, as his smackdown with Castle is one of the highlights of the film.All in all though, an engaging action romp. Jane makes a dark and brooding action hero, while Travolta turns in another effortless role as the villain who slowly cracks up under the pressure. Go in with no preconceptions and you may be pleasantly surprised.",The Punisher

113,jpintar,Pretty good,6,17 April 2004,"I am giving the Punisher a recommendation but with strong reservations.  The movie is dark, grim, and violent.  It is not as fun to watch as Hellboy or the best movies based on comic books such as Superman, Batman, Spiderman, or X Men.  The Punisher is just plain grim and takes place in a depressing world.  There are no heroes or villains, just violence.  The movie doesn't make sense (Is there any police in Tampa, FL, or can you simply murder people at will).  That said, the movie is well acted, especially by Rebeca Stamos and John Travolta.  The action scenes are also very well done. However, this is not the movie that you would want to propose to your girlfriend at.  As a matter of fact, it probably gives the opposite impression, that you intend to break up.",The Punisher
114,tburke85,The Punisher A Decent Comic Book Movie,7,12 June 2009,"The Punisher is a decent comic book movie that was panned by critics but I for one didn't think the film was that bad it just wasn't great. Director Jonathan Hensleigh does an admirable job of adapting the comic book into a feature film keeping it moving at a steady pace with just the right amount of brutal violence thrown in for guilty pleasure. Thomas Jane is good in the title role as Frank Castle a former FBI Agent who becomes a vigilante known as The Punisher who sets his sights on punishing those responsible for murdering his family. Jane may not win any awards for his performance as Castle but he's admirable showing some real talent as an actor especially in the action/fight sequences. John Travolta turns in a decent performance as Howard Saint the man who ordered the hit on Franks family and is now on the top of his list of people to punish for what they did to him. Travolta makes for an effective villain but unfortunately he isn't given much to do and is easily defeated. I suggest you watch Broken Arrow or Face Off if you want to see Travolta as a much better villain than he is in this one mainly because he's given a lot more to do in those films. The rest of the cast including Will Patton, Laura Harrring, Ben Foster, and Rebecca Romijn Stamos are solid as the supporting characters but they like Travolta aren't given much to do. Roy Schieder as Franks father and Samantha Mathis as his wife show up for brief extended appearances before being being written out very quickly because most of the focus is on Jane. Kevin Nash the wrester even makes a cameo in a non speaking role as The Russian a killer for fire who goes after Castle and he does an all right job with his small part. The action/fight sequences are well executed, brutal, and intense but many of them are missing that WOW factor you occasionally get when watching one of these kind of films. The fight between Frank and The Russian is impressive but after a while it gets pretty unrealistic. The music is okay but nothing memorable like Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. Overall though despite it's flaws The Punisher still isn't that bad of a movie that has plenty of action, some character development, suspense, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make it worth watching at least once.",The Punisher
115,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,Extremely underrated movie. Awesome adrenaline rush.,8,24 August 2006,"Of all the comic book films, Fantastic Four and The Punisher are the most underrated of all of them. The Punisher is a great film that unfortunately came out around the same time as Spider-Man 2, so it is often forgotten and bashed. Featuring some cool action, good plot work, excellent acting, and a realistic gritty feel, The Punisher is one to watch.Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is about to retire from the FBI after one last ride, and unfortunately a young adult is killed on the bust. Frank returns home and goes south for a family reunion. What Frank doesn't realizes is that the young man that died in the bust is the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), a business man who is also a ruthless gangster specializing in illegal trade. After Saint's boys massacre Frank's entire family, including his wife and son, Castle becomes the soulless, genius, and ruthless vigilante known only as The Punisher, plotting revenge against the people responsible for the death of his entire family.The movie has its ups and downs. Let's start with the good things. Thomas Jane's performance as Frank Castle is pure genius, one of the most legendary characters in comic book history. I personally liked him more than Dolph Lundgren. He embodies all of Frank's thoughts and feelings, including his feelings of grief, rage, and love, as if they were his own. He really allows the audience to identify and love him. You're rooting for him all the way. I was a bit apprehensive about John Travolta, everyone's favorite good guy, playing Howard Saint. I felt Travolta did rather well with what he was given. There were times where I felt he could have been more evil, but he was still good. He made a fine villain indeed. The supporting cast contains good shows from Will Patton, Rebecca Romijn, and Ben Foster. Yes, Romijn is Mystique in the X-Men films, but you won't mistake her as Raven Darkholme for a second, and it's not just because there's no blue makeup. Ben Foster is creepy in a good way, and he's very likable. Will Patton does well as the right hand man to Howard Saint and a secondary villain of the film. Patton is pretty damn evil himself, almost as good as Travolta. The action does not come as often as I would have hoped, but it is good when it does come. What I liked the most was how clever the action is. It's really enjoyable to watch how Castle gets to what he needs. The music is great, and the movie has a great feel to it that goes perfectly with the story.Jonathan Hensleigh is merely adequate as the director, because, and this is where most people pan the film, the film contains way too much humor to be taken seriously. For example, the very first person Castle interrogates to get to Howard Saint is questioned in a funny way, which I don't think was realistic. I did enjoy the clever lines from Hensleigh, such as 'God's gonna sit this one out'. The humor didn't bother me too much, but I can understand why others were highly disappointed by that. All in all, The Punisher is a great film that's great for anyone ages 14 and up. Enjoy! 8/10 --spy",The Punisher
116,happyendingrocks,"When we're forced to call a Dolph Lundgren film ""superior,"" we're in trouble",4,15 January 2011,"For anyone familiar with the Punisher comic book series, the notion of a film in which the titular vigilante is reduced to a nonsensical bore seems like an impossibility. Perhaps it is a credit to the film-makers of this disjointed revenge vehicle that they accomplish that staggering feat. At least they achieved something.This overlong and largely nonsensical bit of mayhem strips away nearly every facet of the advertised character and instead offers us a stone-faced and wholly unlikeable entity who doesn't ultimately offer a satisfying payoff to the quest for vengeance the plot implies we're supposed to invest ourselves in. The bulk of the film seems tacked on to pave the way for a franchise, yet this initial outing does nothing to encourage or justify any further exploration of the Punisher's savage mission.By completely disregarding the origin outlined in the comic series, the film-makers set themselves up for fans' ""foul"" cries from the onset, and nothing in this movie even attempts to reconcile the on-page Punisher with the one in this far-removed and inherently uninteresting re-imagining. The Punisher is one of the few Marvel ""heroes"" whose metamorphosis has stood the test of time, and it's downright shocking how many liberties are taken with that genesis here. While most of the Marvel characters who have made the transition from panel to screen have been subtly hampered by their quaint formative elements (almost all of which are grounded in the fear/awe of the post-nuclear '60s, which dates them by implication), The Punisher is a timeless creation whose transformation arises as a result of the brutal murder of his wife and son, a distinction which puts him in the ""everyman"" category so crucial to the revenge flick sub-genre.Thomas Jane attempts to channel the steely resolve necessary to bring this archetype to life, but so little time is spent on his emotional transformation that we're left wondering whether he's haunted by the injustice done to his family because it's a callous, life-shattering act of violence, or simply because he knows he's SUPPOSED to be haunted by it. The only grieving we see our Punisher burdened with is a singular flashback scene that recounts the events we've already seen unfold, which strips the film of the complex disintegration of a relatively normal husband and father that we see essayed in the source material.Since the Punisher himself has virtually no character, we are instead forced to explore a slew of ancillary characters, none of whom add anything to the stilted narrative. The introduction of the Costa Rican ""shaman"" who eventually nurses Jane back to health is a mindless diversion since all this supposedly important presence ultimately does is spout a telegraphed line to set up Jane's equally predicable ""God is going to have to sit this one out"" catchphrase. Likewise with each of the three moderately to mind-numbingly annoying neighbors who populate Frank Castle's micro-verse. Two seem to be on hand simply to provide comic relief, which is a bit unsettling since neither of them are funny. The damaged, one-dimensional Rebecca Stamos character serves only as an unrequited love interest whose attraction to Castle seems based solely on him beating up her obsessive ex-boyfriend. We are also forced to spend time with two disposable and ultimately pointless hit men, both of whom easily succumb to Castle's murderous talents and are clearly only in the movie to set up the unspectacular action sequences that spell their demise.In a film full of useless people, the absence of the Microchip character becomes a glaring omission. In the original comics, Microchip served as both an ethical beacon and an invaluable resource, which balanced the homicidal prerequisites of Castle's meted ""punishment"" and offered a plausible explanation for his seemingly unlimited access to weaponry and technology. In this incarnation, Castle is a lone wolf, yet still has access to top-shelf weaponry and has the wherewithal to build an armored car that ends up being destroyed in battle, yet inexplicably re-appears in perfect condition by the film's coda. Unfortunately, so much of this film makes no sense that Castle's acquisition of his arsenal and his invincible ride become two of the more passable plot holes.Even at its most extreme, the basic thread followed in the Punisher comic series had a grounding in the off-panel world that lent it a keen sense of realism. In this film, Castle's covert activities instead open the door for scrutiny, and when we actually stop to consider the implications of revealing himself to his ex-peers in the police force, his afore-mentioned securing of his weaponry, his ability to rent an apartment despite his legal status as ""deceased"", and the fact that it takes several of blasé villain John Travolta's henchmen being murdered for him to get around to sending his goons over to Castle's place of residence, the sloppy plot crumbles under the weight of its ineptness.Don't even get me started on Castle's meticulously plotted revenge scheme, in which he misleads Travolta into killing his own wife and best friend. This is ostensibly done to force Travolta to endure the loss and grief his murderous orders created for Castle, yet Travolta's punishment occurs mere seconds after the reveal, which leaves precious little time for Travolta to react to the results of the carefully crafted ploy. In the end, when our villain gets his come-uppance, we're left wondering why simply shooting all parties involved wouldn't have been a more effective and economical use of The Punisher's time.When the lone non-superhero in the Marvel film canon is the one whose tale is hardest to swallow, something has clearly gone wrong. And when said character has been previously brought to life in a more convincing fashion by Dolph Lundgren, we're clearly dealing with a problematic film. Frank Castle already lost his family. He certainly didn't deserve this.",The Punisher
117,jerekra,"""Call me............THE PUNISHER.""",10,9 February 2013,"The Punisher I fell is one of the best all around movies in the Marvel Franchise of films. It has a great protagonist, great action, and a story that is easy to follow.Frank Castle's family is killed by an evil business man named Howard Saint's gang. Deciding to take the law into his own hands he decides to go after Saint and becomes the Punisher in the process.I think that this film is very well done because it feels like a comic book, and I think that for a Punisher film that works well. There is a dark feeling in this film and I think it sets the mood for the film perfectly. This is how a Punisher film should make you feel.The action is pretty good in this film too. Its not just non stop shooting like the other Punisher films. Castle does a lot of planning and spying on his enemies and outsmarts them. So there is a lot of thinking done by the Punisher and he always was really smart in the comics so I think this film is good at being faithful to the comics in that regard. Not only is the Punisher excellent at combat but he also is very smart and good at preparing and making plans.Thomas Jane is outstanding as the Punisher. He really looks like the Punisher and really conveys the emotions Frank Castle is feeling through facial expression and body language. Jane's performance I think really is a major reason why this film is so great. He just plays the Punisher perfectly.The enemies are pretty standard, nothing too exciting. Although I did think that Kevin Nash as the Russian was a great casting choice. John Travolta is OK as the head of the Saint gang.Supporting characters are good as well. Rebecca Romjin is great as the supporting female character, not a love interest really for the Punisher though. Bumbo and Dave also are great at comedic relief, but also in an important role towards the end, I wont give it away. Rob Schnieder also is great in a brief role as Castle's father.Overall, I think that this is a very good film. This is how a Punisher movie should be like. Highly recommended.",The Punisher
118,swedzin,Honestly... not a real Punisher,5,26 July 2011,"I remember seeing this film back in high school, watched it with my friends... one of my pals, who is a Punisher fan, he was really upset. I thought it was nothing special. But, years later, I did a little research, after a bunch of Punisher comic books, ya know... I was a little bit upset myself after seeing this film again. So I guess that Dolph Lundgren still remains the best Punisher and The Punisher (1989) is the best adaption. Punisher: War Zone (2008) comes second to me and than this one.Now, the storyline is totally different than in the comic books. Did Johnathan Hensleigh read the comic book? Perhaps one of them! The title character is also very different. OK, If you have read the comic, than you know that Frank Castle, aka Punisher is one sick, twisted, insane, cold, sadistic lunatic who uses his military expertise to kill bad guys. He was a guy who almost goes nuts in Vietnam, after a lot action and violence, the murder of his family was like the last drop for his psychic condition. He finally snaps after that. But, here Punisher, played by Thomas Jane, who just didn't do too much with the character. He got all wrong, or he underestimated the character, I don't know... OK, he visually looked pretty solid as a Punisher, you know, dark clothes, dark coat, the skull, and I liked that cold voice too... but I liked voice more in the video game than in the film. For me, Thomas looked pretty sane here... he looked just like guy who wants a revenge, not punishment. Yes, he said in the film ""revenge is an emotional response"", and he looked like he had an emotional response! Yep, he also said this in the comic book, so he punished them all. But... that's just the big talk. Do the punishment!I mean, the Punisher here has killed few people during the film... and on the end, he killed a bunch of them! This is not a spoiler, it's a fact! If you ask me, this film would be over in 20 minutes! But here, Punisher takes photographs, slowly infiltrates into the mob business... setting up a little blackmail game for the key players in the mob family of Saints. Bull***t! He was supposed to kill them all! All! Now! It's like one the end of the film ""Oh, I was supposed to kill them... OK I'll do it!"" Yeah, after hour and a half! And we get no violence, no maximum gore, no blood... just an usual early 90s B movie action style... Punisher here... is a wimp! And to mention few other bad things... When they kill his wife and a son... and when he founds them, it is an exact same footage like in Mad Max (1979)! It is identical! Check it out! And Frank Castle after wards, got shot in a very fatal spot... and he survives! So, he is a superhuman?! OK, now a few more things that irritates me and we'll be done with this. I promise. John Travolta as a leading bad guy Howard Saint? OK, I have never expected him as a leading bad guy, well, it is one big marketing huh? Hollywood, yahoo...! Maybe that's because he was a villain in Pulp Fiction, Face Off or Swordfish? Never, never saw him as a villain here... Punisher villains are supposed to be dark, cold and sick... just like the Punisher himself! Travolta never showed these qualities in the film. He was just like ""OK, I play Punisher villain, I'm bad and I get the money!"" Roy Scheider as a Punisher's father? Gimme a break! Roy was a great actor and he didn't deserve this kind of role. Which brings me to this... WHEN THE HELL... are they gonna stop with this ""origin"" or ""beginning"" comic book hero films... When they will get straight to the point? Who gives a damn how the hero was created in the film! We don't need a visual story about that! Give us the hero already! I wanna see hero in the first 5 minutes of the film! Just like in first Punisher or perhaps Batman (1989)! Straight to the point! Who gives a rat's pink rectum about origins or begins? Just like most of the comic book films of the 2000s... we all need to know where did they come from, what's their past... what's ... who gives a f**k? For the end, I say that the Russian is the only best thing in the film. He looked pretty good here. But, he didn't spoke a single word. And the Russian is really a talk-able man. Other things... no worth mentioning... because they are not important. Well, conclusively... nothing special! And a real waste of time and money as an adaption. I guess this review is pi**ing you off, right? Go watch this film instead... relax.",The Punisher
119,rparham,Punishment indeed,4,1 June 2004,"In the advertisements for The Punisher, the latest comic-book adaptation from the Marvel Comics line, the tag line proclaims `Punishment Begins April 16, 2004.'  It seems Lions Gate Films, the distributor of The Punisher, believes in the adage of truth in advertising, since The Punisher is punishment indeed.  For the audience watching it, that is.
An overlong, boring and downright unappealing cinematic waste, The Punisher is easily the worst Marvel adaptation to come about since the company righted its motion-picture course in the mid-90s, leading to such films as X-Men and Spider-Man.  The film centers on Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), an FBI agent who is retiring from the service to spend time with his family and escape a job that has rendered him solitary.  However, during his last mission, the son of mobster Howard Saint (John Travolta) is accidentally killed, and Saint and his wife (Laura Elena Harring) don't take kindly to this.  In retribution, they dispatch a squad of hit men to Castle's family reunion in Puerto Rico and kill everyone, from Castle's father (Roy Scheider) to his wife (Samantha Mathis) and son (Marcus Johns) and leave Castle for dead.  But, as fate would have it, Castle survives and takes himself on a one-man crusade to `punish' those who destroyed his family.Its obvious The Punisher, conceived originally in the mid-1970s, is a throwback to the vigilante vengeance pictures of that decade, such as Death Wish and Dirty Harry.  However, whatever entertainment value those films possessed is totally missing in The Punisher.  It is a one-note idea stretched to feature length by going through motions that just seem ridiculous.  For example, Frank Castle has made the decision to kill those who killed his family.  So what does he do:  he drives around town in a suped-up Ford GTO, takes pictures of his targets and concocts elaborate schemes to cause their downfall.  Yet, what is this really accomplishing when all he wants to do is simply kill them?  It's forcing us to watch as director-screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh drags a paper-thin idea to the very edges of breaking for over two hours, that's what.For an action film, there is also little action to speak of in the film. There is one mildly-diverting car chase that is over in no time flat, a fight between Castle and a hit-man for hire named the Russian (played by wrestler Kevin Nash) that is okay, but nothing to get your blood rushing, and aside from some uninteresting carnage at the end of the film, that is about it. It would be nice to report that what is missing in action is made up for in character development, but such is not the case.  After we are introduced to Castle and his family, and then they are murdered, all we really see is Castle sulking around his apartment, downing Wild Turkey whiskey by the bottle, and driving out to barely forward his plan of revenge.  Hensleigh and co-writer Michael France attempt to create a new `family' for Castle in the form of other outcasts of life made up of waitress Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), video-game freak Dave (Ben Foster), and Bumpo (John Pinette).  This proves not only uninteresting, but largely stupid, as the characters are just silly diversions that are supposed to remind us that outcasts are people too and need to take refuge in each other's company.  It also doesn't help that the film robs the villains of any menace by making them complete blithering idiots.  It seems obvious by midpoint in the film that they know of the whereabouts of Castle, and they keep sending high-priced hit men to rub him out, but to no avail.  Why don't they just show up at his apartment and mow him down with machine guns?  It would seem to be a lot cheaper than bringing in all this expensive outside talent.As far as acting goes, it's pretty standard fare.  Thomas Jane is capable and gets the job done, but there is nothing to notice here.  John Travolta is okay as gangster Saint, but doesn't really distinguish himself from his previous villainous performances.  He was more entertaining in Swordfish. Will Patton turns in probably the best performance as Saint's right hand man Quentin Glass.  He is low-key and effective when necessary, without being over-the-top.  Roy Scheider and Samantha Mathis get what amount to cameos, and that's about all there is the mention.The saddest thing to mention about The Punisher is that this is actually the second adaptation of this material.  The first was a late-80s entry that starred Dolph Lundgren and went straight-to-video.  That film was hardly regarded as a masterpiece, so you would have thought that Jonathan Hensleigh would have tried to learn from others mistakes, but unfortunately not.  The Punisher is, in the end, one long, two-hour mistake that would be nice to be able to forget.",The Punisher
120,Alex-372,Not The Punisher,6,15 April 2007,"As a one time reader of the Punisher: Warzone series and Punisher: Survival, I have to say I started the movie off slightly disappointed.This punisher, although defined, isn't nearly massive enough for the 'real' Frank Castle. I think this role was made for bodybuilder Mike Matarazzo, who would be absolutely perfect in it. But I digress.The second problem is that this Frank Castle is not nearly nuts enough. He was crazier than the original Rambo (First Blood), who was pretty unstable himself.Third, the details were off. In The Punisher, Frank's little nuclear family was killed in Central Park, not at some extended family get together in Puerto Rico.I also thought that Thomas Jane didn't have the intensity or gravitas for the role. I like Rebecca Romijn Stamos.The minor characters were put in to supply comic relief. I don't think comic relief was needed, if the directors had taken a darker, more Gothic approach to the story. I would have liked to see more of Frank's mental instability. More Se7en meets Batman.I thought it was interesting to see Will Patton outside of his bookish, intellectual performance on ""The Agency"".",The Punisher

123,AwesomeWolf,Totally awesome,9,8 September 2005,"Having never read a Punisher comic in my life, all I can say about the new 'Punisher' film is: ""awesome, totally awesome"". I've also seen the Dolph Lundgren version that was made in the 80s, and Frank Castle turned up the 90s Fox 'Spider-Man' cartoon (to kill Spidey, of course). Given that exposure alone, and me being an action movie fan-boy and everything, I think I should start reading Punisher comics. They must be totally awesome.Frank Castle (Tom Jane) is the average ""cop on one final special operation before retiring to a desk job but something goes wrong"" kind of cop. In this case, Castle is an undercover FBI Special Agent investigating the Saint family. The operation is blown, and Castle accidentally kills Bobby Saint. In retaliation Howard Saint (John Travolta) tracks Frank to a family reunion, and orders his goons to kill Frank and the entire Castle family. Left for dead, Frank somehow survives, and takes it upon himself to 'punish' Howard Saint and his cronies.I mentioned before that I've never read a Punisher comic before. Without having read any Punisher stories, I can not comment on how true the latest film stays to the source material. For all I know, it could be straying very far from the comics. The movie is dark, sometimes funny, and oddly captivating. The only thing separating this from the multitude of ""man's family is killed, man gets revenge"" 'Death Wish' clones out there is that 'The Punisher' has strange violent opera feel to it.As an action movie, 'The Punisher' is totally awesome. It is violent and aggressive, perfect for any action movie fan, and probably perfect for the character of Frank Castle. While the movie does slow down at times, it boasts some really cool action scenes. The best is easily Castle's one on one fight against the Russian (Kevin Nash). The fact that Tom Jane is nowhere as physically imposing as Nash or good ole' Dolph Lundgren makes that scene (and others) all the more impressive.I've seen a few Marvel movies recently, from the terrible 'Nick Fury: Agent of Shield', through the average at best 'Elektra' to the totally awesome 'The Punisher', and I haven't even reached the 'Blade' trilogy yet, but I will, oh I will. For now, 'The Punisher' is an awesome movie, and easily my favourite of the Marvel comic adaptations - 9/10",The Punisher
124,papanloveu,Underrated.,7,27 September 2021,I can't call this a bad movie but its also hard to consider it good. Thomas Jane was a great choice for Frank Castle but he isn't given a chance to show his Punisher off. The story is slow and tries to be a Character study but misses the mark even on that. A little more action and a higher body count would really have helped this film. Travolta gets to ham it up and does a good job as the main Villian but even he wasn't given enough time to really develop the Character. I dont hate the movie.,The Punisher
125,jdring2007,"well-acted, violent, dramatic, yet still great fun",9,11 October 2021,"I won't get into the details of how faithful or unfaithful this movie is with the comics. It remains my favorite iteration of Frank Castle and The Punisher to date. One of my all-time favorite comic characters since I was a kid, and I'll stand by saying that Thomas Jane portrayed him powerfully and beautifully. The dramatic elements were great and moving, the tragedy that they stemmed from was very well executed and not held back at all. Travolta played the bad guy exceptionally, and with some flair. More so at the end, wink wink. Will Patton was also a great addition, and all of the henchmen were memorable themselves, even in their small roles. As was Ben Foster, who's always amazing. The action was sometimes humorous, too, while at other times brutal, but far less gruesome than in the 2008 installment with Ray Stevenson. That said, this one is still very enjoyable.",The Punisher
126,randyfromscream,LOVE THIS MOVIE! Worth a watch if you're a fan like me,10,19 November 2017,I'm a Punisher fan and I think this is the best superhero film since the Spider-Man movies. This has the be the best Punisher film I've seen and the reason why I'm re reviewing it because for the honor of the Netflix series be release and I've seen parts of the show and I like it so far. Honestly this is better than Hulk (2003) and beat the other Punisher movies. I love this as much as Spider-Man 2 (2004) (another good film from 04) and I like pretty much everything in this film. Defiantly worth a watch my dude,The Punisher
127,foxtografo,Didn't feel like a Punisher movie,6,17 August 2021,"I liked how Thomas Jane looks as The Punisher, plus I like him as an actor, I think he's a cool dude, but precisely because of that it didn't feel like the Punisher from the comics. His presence is not imposing, and they tried to make the character nice and friendly, not too violent and careless about criminals like he should be, too much of a hero, which I think misses the target in portraying the original material.It's not a bad movie if the main character was someone else, but being The Punisher, originally a hardcore criminal assassin, basically, this script seemed unfitting.And it's hard to ignore, when most of the movie Castle is setting up and executing an intricate plan to ""punish"" the villain beyond physical pain, instead of just blowing everyone up in a tactical way.I know many would think this would be a stupid movie, but it's what the character is, and I'm sure it can be done interestingly.Also Jane (and this is the script's and director's fault, really) doesn't do well at looking badass, as he gets his ass kicked and shoot in silly ways way too often, and looks clumsy and weak in most of the action scenes.Overall I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie, but I firmly think that it fails to portrait the original character properly.",The Punisher
128,lagriff05,Actually a good Marvel comic-to-movie transition,8,30 June 2007,"More Marvel comic book films is not usually seen as a good thing in my eyes. It seems like any comic-to-movie transition ends up as total garbage, and is plagued with lame humor and stale cheese. But this one is pretty much the one that sticks out as actually good. That's right, the Punisher doesn't suck at all. I am not an avid follower of the Punisher comic books, so this review is just based on what I see in this movie. And what I see here is a vividly dark, charismatic, and brutal revenge film that doesn't go without reminding of similar films like The Crow and Wake of Death. Frank Castle is a tormented spirit, and you're certainly free to question his motives in killing off these mobsters, but I wouldn't let that effect my rating of the film. Despite my rather lukewarm feelings toward Castle's final justice against his enemies, I found this film extremely enjoyable, as long as you're just expecting a kick-ass action flick (what else would you really walk in expecting to see, anyway?). The acting is pretty damn good, especially by Thomas Jane and John Trevolta, both of whom are quickly becoming favorite actors of mine.Qualms with it? Well, as much as they tried to make a darker Marvel movie, some of that dreaded campiness is still afloat. It doesn't really detract too much actually, as the humorous and lighthearted side characters make for a good counterbalance to Castle's dark and brooding nature. But other than that, I'd say this is a very solid movie. Great dark visuals, not bad of a script, and a movie that just balances itself out well enough in order to work. The ending was pretty stereotypical, but at least we can look forward to a sequel. Recommended to anyone who's tired of the crappy Marvel movies we get nowadays.",The Punisher
129,Jakealope,"Rambo Meets Death Wish, It's Barely Watchable Tripe",3,26 March 2013,"I just bought a Blu-Ray player so I was looking for some cheap $5 disks to check it out. The name was familiar based on an even worse sequel I watched a while back on free cable. There wasn't much expectation so I really wasn't disappointed by it.It is pretty cheesy to judge a movie with some simple comparison like ""Rambo Meets Death Wish"". But in this case, it is applicable. The characters, action and production values are good enough to make it watchable, it certainly isn't cheap grindhouse or direct to video fare. But Death Wish is far more believable and better in every respect, except for its massively cheesy sequels. Rambo is a far more dramatic actioner and Tom Jane aka the Punisher is like Ryan Reynolds in comparison to Stallone.But it is the same old same old, Bad guys kill super cop ex-commando's family, ergo he gets license to go medi-evil on the greasy well heeled mobsters that did these horrible deeds. Good guy has plethora of neat weapons as well as he's Mr. MMA. There is an interesting coterie of freaky neighbor friends to make it a little interesting. John Travolta and Will Patton are the baddies and they make them slightly better than total pulp cartoons. But in the end, any movie where one of my most hated actors, aka Vinnie Barbarino, dies a fiery death can't be all bad.Marvel Comics production or not, it is just a cheap comic book movie no matter how hard they tried to make it upscale",The Punisher

He did the best acting in this movie. Great acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, script, and art design.I thought that the only exception to the great acting was John Travolta. He did a horrible acting job. I think that Ben Foster, should have had his role. I think Travolta, should have been thrown off the set, either the minute that they began filming, or right after his audition. Ben Foster, could have played that role both masterfully and a thousand times better.Overall, an excellent movie. Kudos to the cast, (except Travolta), crew, and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up.

131,jrfranklin01,Took me about 50% of the way,5,11 October 2004,"Like the caption says, this film took me 50% of the way as far as captivation. It starts out very well in getting the audience to identify with the main character, Frank Castle (Thomas Jane). It shows us how he is good at his work, misses his family and regrets not being with them, and is fearful for his family and the future. Perfect setup and delivery at getting the audience to sympathize. This is what makes the film all the more powerful when Castle's entire family is brutally slain. I say brutal because it surely is. In fact, you should immediately rule out the younger audience with this movie. A few SPOILERS below.Frank's survives his own death, so to speak, and returns back to the world of the living with nothing but hatred and vengeance filling his being. He pursues a plan of retribution against his attackers that costs them greatly (financially and mortally). All of this is going along quite well, you have your jaw at least half-dropped by now, and then.............they blow it. I don't know if Marvel has to have their hands in every production that uses one of their characters, but the second half of the film goes back into a fairytale comic-book reality. The first most obvious evidence of this is a visit to Castle's apartment by a muscle-bound juggernaut, who pretty much kills Castle at least twenty times. Miraculously, Frank defeats the brute in an unbelievable battle pairing the likes of which is more incredible than David and Goliath. But a few minutes in a secret area under the floor with a beautiful recovering alcoholic give Frank enough time to rejuvenate himself and take on the world. Yeah, right. And then we have the big showdown at the end (completely different from the earlier production of ""The Punisher"" with Dolph Lundgren where he takes on the Yakutza in the upper floor of a high rise). Castle quickly dispatches several goons with an explosive, but then, despite this genius, storms in and gets shot several times. While he actually does show some smarts in wearing a vest (he still can't shoot straight), the goons are moronic enough not to think of shooting him in the head! All of this was in the attempt to show the audience the struggle of taking on the bad guys and how Frank is not superhuman and continues to suffer. But I found most of these ideas came off as garnish on a dinner plate - its sometimes fancy and adds a little something, but most times it's unnecessary. And the coup de grace is the main bad guy being dragged away by a car into an explosion of automobiles that in the end, after they have all exploded....(hold on tight now!).......make the skull-face symbol of The Punisher! Oooooohhh. Real impressive. Marvel, if it's you, stay in comic books and out of movies!",The Punisher

133,michaelhirakida,"One Of The Most Ridiculous ""Dark"" Comic Book Movies Ever Made.",7,14 March 2016,"I went on Netflix and saw they had The Punisher on there so I thought, why not? I'm up for some action. To call this movie Dark is an overstatement. This is one of the goofiest, ridiculous, dark movies I have ever seen. Where to even begin with this? Well, the first 30 minutes acts pretty serious and seem promising. It looks like it's gonna be a movie that is a tale of revenge with an Ennio Morricone like score. But when Frank Castle moves into an apartment that three weird and quirky people live in, my god. It gets so far from dark. Here are the reasons why the movie is not dark. The sound effects half the time made me think I was playing Half Life 2. Every single sound effect is horribly stock and childish which makes 88% of action scenes stupid. Some scenes are also stupid. For example, the three quirky people dance and sing to Rigoletto as Frank gets beat up by a guy who is a combination of Hulk Hogan and Waldo. To top things off, he throws a grenade at him, hits it back like a baseball bat and explodes the bathroom while no one notices what is going on.The film looked grainy and feels like it was made in the 90's. I don't know what the cinematographer was doing using a camera that had ultra grain on it, but seriously, it made the movie look even worse.Also, the violence isn't very brutal as I was expecting it to be. Sure it's bloody, but nothing brutal or disturbing. Most of the fights end way to fast with the exception of the Hulk Hogan/Waldo guy, especially the final shootout. Some of the action is even over the top. John Travolta is not a threatening villain. He literally does nothing until the very end. He lets his inept goons do all the work while he either smokes a Cuban or Sits in a leather chair. So did I like anything about this movie? Because I complained a lot about it being too goofy or not dark.Well I Enjoyed it.The whole movie had me laughing at some of the ridiculous acting and dialog, the ending where Howard Saint is blinded by Frank and Mickey to murder his best friend and wife who he thinks she is cheating on him is absolutely brilliant, I enjoyed the three quirky characters, especially the fat guy and the whole movie feels like a modern day western in some respects. If you want a dark movie, you're not gonna find it here. If you want an over the top action movie with some humor, you'll may find this enjoyable. The Punisher manages to tape itself from falling apart.75/100 B-",The Punisher
134,Pavel-8,"The Best ""Movie"" of 2004.",7,23 March 2005,"""The Punisher"" is a different flavor in the candy store of Marvel Comics recent cinematic adaptations. Unlike the rest of the movies (""The Hulk"", ""Spider-Man"", etc.), this is not a PG-13-rated flick aimed at a universal audience. Instead first-time director Jonathan Hensleigh has helmed a dark, brooding, brutal movie that will likely be either utterly enjoyed or fully shunned.Our hero is Frank Castle (Thomas Jane, ""61*"", ""Deep Blue Sea""), an undercover federal agent who is getting out of the business. Unfortunately criminal bigwig Howard Saint (John Travolta) has other ideas after losing a son in a Castle-led sting operation. Saint exacts revenge on Castle, leaving him bruised, battered, and presumably dead. Of course Castle survives, and the rest of the picture revolves around his quest for vengeance...nope, make that punishment. Along the way, he encounters a quirky trio of neighbors and the obligatory menacing villains.After the battle lines are drawn (okay, even before that) the movie is straight forward and aptly named, as Castle proceeds to fulfill his titular role. ""Punisher"" could easily have promptly fallen off the quality map, but a strong effort by all involved results in a high production value that makes the film enjoyable despite being a one-trick pony.What drives the rest of the movie is not so much what happens as how and to whom it happens. Despite being primarily one-dimensional, Castle's neighbors possess enough originality to generate sympathetic appeal, even though Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is oddly out of place in her small and unglamorous role. Jane conjures a brooding, hulking look, filling the part with the proper gravity, yet making the character likable due to his relatively justifiable motives.Unlike most of the recent comic book flicks, ""Punisher"" features almost no CGI effects. Instead most everything is done by stunt crews, from explosions to car chases. This brings a refreshing and gritty realism to the movie, mirroring the physical nature of the title character. Cool blues and blacks dominate the cinematography, which effectively uses the widescreen to capture the semi-tropical location, the rarely filmed city of Tampa, which provides a pleasant reprieve from the usual big cities in such movies.Like most comic book movies, this one has few pretenses of reality, as the murderous rampage of the protagonist goes ridiculously unchecked, providing a good deal of unintentional comedy along the way. Plus the moral issues of such revenge are highly sketchy. But in this black-and-white world, such deficiencies can be ignored for two hours, and that is plenty of time to be pulled into a violent yet entertaining picture.Bottom Line: The best popcorn movie of 2004. 6 of 10.",The Punisher
135,jake-law123,Piece of crap!,3,30 December 2010,"Frank Castle, aka, The Punisher, is one of the most badass comic book heroes of the world. Other Marvel heroes, like Spider Man, the Incredible Hulk, and Iron Man, all have special powers or abilities to fight crime. Punisher's method of fighting is simple, GUNS! Nothing special, nothing incredible, just a gun toting vigilante. But for every comic book hero, there's always a movie update. What we get for the Punisher is this pointless, stupid, and boring insult to the awesome comics. How could you possibly screw this up, its not that difficult. No visual effects required. Just a decent action film, is that so hard?Frank Castle, now retired, settles down with his family with a family reunion in Puerto Rico. His last assignment resulted in his men killing the son of a mob boss known as Howard Saint, (John Travolta). Seeking revenge, Howard hires his men to go to Puerto Rico to murder Frank and his family. Afterwards, Frank barely survives, and is nursed back to health. He then declares a war on Howard and his company, seeking the proper vengeance by becoming the Punisher. The only good thing about this movie is that it follows the comic books, thats about it.This film lacks any common sense whatsoever. The beginning part didn't make any sense at all for one thing. I get what goes on, but its not very well explained. Frank must be invincible, for he survives countless shots in the chest, then is nursed back as if never shot. But other than that, the film just goes nowhere. If he seeks vengeance, then do it! So much time in this movie is wasted. So many pointless scenes. Never gets down to the dirty work, just the same boring crap for two hours.The action scenes are rare, and very short, making the film suffer from boredom. It took me forever to finally finish it. Not even the final scene is worth watching. It lasts a few minutes, and not much happens. The realism in this film is pathetic. Apparently people can survive being shot in the head, or being shot with a shotgun TWICE in the chest.The performances made me wanna puke. Not even John Travolta was convincing. Thomas Jane has no more emotion in the film once his family dies, which although makes sense, makes his performance less cool or relating. Pointless cameo by Roy Scheider, playing Frank's dad, who's not even in it for more than 10 minutes.This movie is nothing but a mockery, a spoof to the true, legendary hero.

This is one of the best movies I have seen this year and I go to at least one movie a week. The acting was good. This movie is one of those movies that make you wonder why every movie isn't as good. However, if you are aren't the type that likes intense violence and content a bit more mature than PG, then I don't recommend this at all to you.Tom Jane plays Frank Castle, a broken and confused F.B.I. agent who loses his family to a band of mobsters, who horrifically slaughter every last one of the members of his family, including his extended family. The pain and anger that he deals with causes him to become what he used to hunt down, a murderer who slaughters criminals day and night. His first target is the man responsible for his family's murder, a man named Howard Saint (terrifically played by John Travolta).

138,skymovies,Better than its box office,6,8 March 2005,"Flawed though it is, The Punisher should be applauded as a blessedly CG-free comic book adaptation that is largely true to its roots and delivers some satisfying chunks of meaty action. In order to secure a youth-friendly certificate, punch-pulling Hollywood has been reducing too many heroes to bloodless abominations of late  see Daredevil, Hellboy, King Arthur and the risible Catwoman for details.Looking like Christopher Lambert's younger brother, Tom (Thomas/Tommy/T-boy?) Jane broods nicely as Frank Castle, the former super-soldier and undercover cop out to return the family-massacring 'favour' done to him by pipe-smoking, money-laundering villain Howard Saint, played by Travolta in typically mannered style.The big bangs and gunplay to be expected of the tried-and-trusted storyline are interspersed by a few neat quirks (a guitar-playing hit-man, Roy Scheider in a what's-he-doing-here? cameo, the burning-cars-as-logo finale), but what should be a lean narrative is made flabby by the unnecessary introduction of Castle's odd bunch of flatmates. Only in the movies do girls who look like Rebecca Romijn-Stamos work in breakfast bars and live in filthy tenement blocks. The tone is uneven too, with the generally calculated viciousness of Castle's vendetta at odds with, for instance, a decidedly tongue-in-cheek scuffle with a Russian man mountain played to opera.But why The Punisher flopped isn't altogether clear. Maybe audiences demand that all their comic-based movies look like PlayStation games or be fronted by big names? Because The Punisher's brand of solid, if unremarkable, entertainment is much more enjoyable than watching Ben Affleck flouncing around in a PVC gimp outfit.",The Punisher

142,Dodger-9,Surprisingly good,7,8 May 2005,"Saturday night, the TV is awful so i popped this on expecting a movie as bad as it sounded. Never read the Marvel comic which inspired it but revenge thrillers can be a hit and miss affair at the best of times, especially when you can see the plot trajectory a mile off. However,one of the main things going for it was Jonathan Hensleigh. The talented scriptwriter had delivered some inspired work on Die Hard With A Vengeance and Armageddon and with Gale Anne Hurd producing, you know you're in for something a little more polished than your average no brainer flick. As a director and screenwriter, Hensleigh is a formidable force who did wonders with the $33million budget. Tom Jane is excellent as the eponymous hero, Frank Castle, seeking revenge after his family are wiped out by a ganglord (John Travolta). Laura Harring, the sexy protagonist from Mulholland Dr. is sadly wasted as his sultry wife, while an almost unrecognisable Samantha Mathis plays Castle's ill-fated spouse and then Rebecca Romijn Stamos pops up as the down on her luck tenant who falls for her hunky neighbour. While the first chunk feels like Mad Max revisited - wholesome law enforcer turned into a shell of a man after the death of his wife and son - the middle features a pointless comedy fight scene between Castle and a pumped up Russian villain. The third act is rather good, despite some sadistic scenes - if i never see a weedy supporting character having his piercings ripped out with pliers i'll be a happy bloke. A good looking nod to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel with an above average score. Not the greatest movie ever made and despite the obligatory Marvel shot of the hero explaining his future in a voice over at the end, i for one wouldn't mind seeing more adventures with Castle.",The Punisher
143,bannonanthony,"""God's gonna sit this one out"".",7,22 June 2005,"Another brilliant adaptation of a Marvel Comics character. I haven't read any of the Punisher's comic exploits, but I was familiar with the character. I was a bit disappointed that Frank Castle (played brilliantly by Thomas Jane) doesn't actually call himself the Punisher until the very end. But that aside, this is a great movie as we see the Punisher begin his quest against crime.The tone of the film is mostly pretty bleak after the slaughter of Frank's family, but there are occasional moments of humour. John Travolta and Will Patton add great support as the villains of the film, with Travolta chewing the scenery all the way as the evil Howard Saint. X-MEN's Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is good in her role as Frank's neighbour Joan, who ultimately helps him find the courage to go on living after his quest is done. The two other neighbours, Bumpo and Spacker Dave are very colourful as well. It is painful watching the scene where Patton tortures Dave, so be prepared for that.There are colourful villains everywhere such as country singing gunman Harry Heck and the gigantic Russian (pro-wrestler Kevin Nash) who takes part in a very comic fight scene. The action scenes are excellently staged, particularly the final takedown of the Saint goons at Saint's nightclub. I must say I was a bit disappointed again when the cool GTO Frank drives got trashed pretty early in the film, as I'm a muscle car fan. But at least he gets an equally cool replacement when he takes Harry Heck's Plymouth after killing him. All in all, the Punisher is a great film but you should be prepared for a lot of downbeat moments. I look forward to the sequel. I hope it's as good as this one.",The Punisher

145,MetalGeek,"Enjoyable Action Pic, but not quite ""THE PUNISHER"" if you know what I mean...",6,10 November 2010,"During my teenage comic book geek days, The Punisher was one of my favorite Marvel characters, and he also seemed like one that would translate well to the silver screen. Unfortunately for fans of Frank Castle, 1989's Direct-To-Video ""Punisher"" film starring Dolph Lundgren turned out to be just another generic action flick that may have been enjoyable in its own right but it did no justice to the character whatsoever (I'm still convinced that when New World Pictures obtained the ""Punisher"" license, they never read a single issue of the comic, they just dusted off a leftover action-movie script they had in a drawer someplace and changed some characters' names.) Fifteen (!) years later Marvel Studios tried again with this flawed but enjoyable ""reboot,"" which brings the character closer to the Punisher that I knew and loved as a teen but still makes some annoying changes that were more or less unnecessary. We all know the Punisher's origin by now: he was a decorated Marine sniper whose entire family was killed by the Mafia. Donning an all black costume and toting a variety of weaponry, Frank becomes ""The Punisher,"" doling out vengeance upon those who ruined his life, and also moving onward to destroying criminal activity wherever it may hide. So far, so good. To update the Vietnam-era origin story somewhat, Frank (Thomas Jane of ""Dreamcatcher"") is an FBI counterterrorism expert in this version, and as the film opens he is finishing his last sting operation before retiring. During a shootout, agents kill the son of a very powerful Florida gangster named Howard Saint (played by a delightfully slimy John Travolta) who of course demands payback. Castle's retirement party in an island paradise is attacked by Saint's mercenaries, who slaughter not only his wife and young son but EVERYBODY in his family, in a marvelously over the top scene of carnage. Needless to say, Frank is not going to let the deaths of his loved ones go ""unpunished,"" leading him to mount his one man war on Saint's organization.As a straight up revenge flick this ""Punisher"" is not bad at all. Thomas Jane has the muscles and square jaw required to play a totally bad-ass Frank, and the story is more or less the same as the original comic, but setting the entire film in sunny Florida (rather than the gritty urban hellholes familiar to comic book readers) is an odd choice for locale. The film also shoe horns in an annoying side plot involving Frank's neighbors in his run down apartment building, one of whom (the lovely Rebecca Romijn) spends the entire movie trying to get to know the mysterious Man in Black better. The other two doofuses (a fat guy and a nerd with a bunch of facial piercings) are simply there to provide comic relief which is not needed.The film drags for a bit in the mid section, particularly when Travolta's character sends several ""professional"" assassins after Castle in a series of odd scenes which feel like padding. One hired killer, ""The Russian,"" looks like he walked in out of a Popeye movie, and the other, a guitar toting Southerner with an Elvis 'do, even stops to sing a song to Castle in a diner (!) before attacking him later in the movie. Thankfully these scenes are over quickly and Travolta decides to handle Castle ""in house,"" setting the scene for the grand finale. When Frank starts dealing out 9MM justice you cheer as each of Travolta's bully boys go down one by one. The action sequences, stunt work and pyrotechnics are also excellent. Action movie junkies who aren't already familiar with the Punisher saga will have a blast with this one.As for me, I enjoyed the film but still found it to be, more or less, a ""Punisher"" movie in name only, just like the 1989 film. Why has it been so hard for Hollywood to translate ""The Punisher"" into an accurate film? Maybe they finally got it right in the third film, ""Punisher: War Zone,"" which I haven't seen yet. Until I do, I'd say this ""Punisher"" ranks higher than the Dolph Lundgren version but still falls frustratingly short of the mark.",The Punisher
146,kylehodgdon,Middle Of The Road,5,11 November 2009,"I can't say I liked this movie, but I didn't really dislike it either. It was kind of just there. The actors all did just fine in their respective roles and the story was a story, not good, not bad. I don't really know what to expect with the Punisher character. I know I like his shirt. But I'm not really sure what else to think of him. He's a tough guy who usually gets what he wants, but to me there does not seem to be much substance to him. This film definitely has too much cheese for its own good. The attempts at humor is something only an immature fourteen year old might find funny. To me, this movie should have been better. I see no reason why an interesting story with characters who want to be acting in it cannot be produced for this title. It seems like the movie started being filmed, nobody liked how it was looking, so they all gave up and slapped together something as quick as they could so they could all move on. Skip it unless you are hard up for a mindless action film.",The Punisher
147,Lomedin,Fun film,7,24 April 2011,"When watching this film, I had the feeling to be watching one of those good old 80s action films. This movie is funny and violent in a good balance. I don't think it's meant to be taken 100% serious but looked at it always expecting to find something to smile at. I believe that was the purpose of the director and it works perfectly. After all, you don't need and all dark, all true character/plot to make an action film work. I guess it's not a coincidence that the director wrote a Die Hard title. Don't let the ""pretty boy"" looks of this Kastle fool you, that's part of the fun. Also, Travolta plays well the role of the gang leader. An entertaining film to watch and re-watch, guaranteed.",The Punisher
148,Asteri-Atypical,Haven't we seen this before? Many times?,4,6 January 2007,"I've seen this movie too many times.Oh, not ""The Punisher"". I mean the story. The characters. The formula. Sadly, this movie departed little from the ""hero deals blow to crime boss... crime boss gets revenge on hero's loved ones... hero, after being thought dead, comes back to violently ruin crime boss' day... big showdown in the end"" formula. There's really very little original here.This movie departed from the comic book in a number of ways. Sadly, nearly every such departure was a major step in the WRONG direction. Most notably was the well-known tragedy which turned Frank Castle into the Punisher. In the comics the long-established origin is that Castle's family was accidentally caught in crossfire in a mob war. Sadly, this movie's solution lacked the power and grit of the comic version. I imagine this was changed just to make it more an action scene. Whatever the reason - BAD MOVE.Overall this movie was unoriginal and leaned towards the ""stupid"" side where you get the feeling the writers didn't consider their audience to be very intelligent.Can I recommend this movie? Not really. While not the worst movie, there's nothing here which hasn't been done better in many other movies. If you're a fan of the comic; you will be genuinely disappointed with the changes.",The Punisher
149,themarina1,When's the sequel?,8,28 April 2004,"This rocked. It's all true. This movie is made up of a predictable plot, witty one liners and lots of action and violence yet, it's a highly enjoyable mix. The action sequences where well choreographed and entertaining to watch and although the individuals in this flick seemed to sustain more pain than any real person(hey, he is based on a comic book...)it was never completely obscene. And though the dialogue was predictable, it managed to be acceptable in the scheme of this movie. The acting wasn't bad either with Jane creating a likable (good looking too!) hero. If the studio manages to keep this team of writers, producers (and whoever else made this movie happen) together, there's potential for an excellent slew of flicks. For starters, I'd just like to see a great sequel.Side note: this is rated 18A for a reason. Not the most appropriate thing for the 12 year old comic reader. Stick to Spiderman9/10",The Punisher
150,joker-4,Comicbook Actioneer a Safe Hit,7,19 April 2004,"Loosely based on Don Pendleton's THE EXECUTIONER novel series, the Punisher, as a  character and motif, is not easily corruptible - although how New World Pictures screwed up  the 1989 adaptation is not something that is going to be discussed here - and Jonathan  Hensleigh in his directorial debut proved just how intriguing, and compelling, such a  character can be. Not exactly the most colorful from the Marvel Comics stable, the Punisher is certainly the  most direct. As a result, the film is equally direct as Hensleigh crafts a fun comicbook action  movie that, if anything, comes across as being very safe. From the murder of his family to  donning the trademarked death's head to the film's inevitable punishment, THE PUNISHER provides action, humor and even expands on the character's origin making the character as  relatable - and perhaps even sympathetic - as a war-torn judge/jury/executioner type can  be. With action and characterization present, what the film ended up missing was its unique  style, or a hipness that the other Marvel hits possessed. Conrad W. Hall photographed well  keeping the film as starkly real as possible, but absent was the flair. The comicbook editing  seen in the HULK wasn't needed here, but an exhilarating car case ala BAD BOYS 2 would  have been most welcome. Even John Travolta's Howard Saint was played with air of familiarity  and appears scatheless. Where was the unpredictability that Travolta offered such characters  in such hits as BROKEN ARROW and SWORDFISH? Perhaps this will be answered in the  sequels. What THE PUNISHER does have is Thomas Jane, who wins the award for best adaptation of a  comicbook character. Jane plays the role as both emotion-filled and emotionless when  necessary. Runner-up for the award is Kevin Nash's Russian character, who is perfect down  to the tattoos. Violent and fun, THE PUNISHER is a great hit and a viable franchise.",The Punisher
151,Derek237,"A good, but flawed action movie",7,9 June 2006,"It's getting harder and harder to find good action movies today. I admire The Punisher for its great action sequences, but I don't feel it has the greatest story to back it up. The acting was good enough to make everything convincing, but by the end it feels like low-rent Shakespeare, or something.I think the general rule of a movie like this, where the main character loses his family, is that he always has to be exceedingly, exceedingly happy. He strolls along the beach with his wife, she talks about how blessed they are, he has a heart-to-heart with his son, his dad makes a big speech about how much he loves every single person present. Stuff like that. We know what's going to happen (everyone before seeing the movie must have read the synopsis or seen the preview!), so it's almost a bit sadistic to linger around at the beginning so much. But no matter. Once the plot gets moving, some great action ensues.That's the best part of the movie, as I said. There are some truly awesome action scenes that aren't swamped with CGI and aren't too flashy. I thought the scene with The Russian was just pure brilliance. What an excellent and offbeat sequence that was. Definitely my favourite scene in the movie.I've never read any of the Punisher comics so I really just see this as an action movie, not a comic-book adaptation. I know the movie doesn't promise to be a light-hearted romp or anything, but it was kind of off-putting to have such a cool action movie mixed with such a miserable, gloomy atmosphere. It's hard to cheer for a hero when he's drunk and on the verge of suicide through most of the movie. All this considered, it does a damn good job of it anyway. Thom Jane is perfect in the role and John Travolta keeps up his practice as the slimy villain character.This is no doubt a flawed movie, there are some things that just don't make too much sense (I won't bother getting into them), and it's certainly not the kind of movie you want to take your grandmother to, but in a generation devoid of Stallones and Shwarzeneggers, this was a small comeback for the action film, and carries some hope for future action films, and this is, quite indeed, a run-on sentence, but I refuse to edit. Goodnight.My rating 7/10",The Punisher
152,Adorable,Miami Vice Does Gotham,8,21 June 2004,"When one sets out to purposefully craft a mindless, visceral action romp while bypassing the travails of cinematic intellect they run little risk of producing anything even remotely embarrassing, since expectations generally remain low with these products. Such is The Punisher's lot. It's essentially a return to crime-busting episodes from the 80's, like Cobra or some of Arnie's less-exemplary output (Raw Deal, for instance). Director Hensleigh's debut (he did screenplay duties for The Saint and Armageddon) leaves thought-provoking values at home, choosing to pack in their stead lots of gruesome violence and brutality chic, resulting in much of the same candid mayhem we loved so much fifteen to twenty years ago in your typical Michael Pare flick. As a tribute to a genre now usually encumbered with allusions to grandeur, The Punisher works with flying colors. Speaking of colors, its Tampa-based setting clearly distinguishes it from 1989's rendition of the classic Marvel comic, starring Dolph Lundgren. The latter had New York as grounds for an abattoir, and therefore projected more of a dimly lit, comic-book vibe than the contemporary project. Overall, it appears the new production seeks as much distance from the former attempt as possible. Also, unlike Lundgren's gloomy Frank Castle, Thomas Jane (Deep Blue Sea, Dreamcatcher) delivers a homely FBI agent made deplorable vigilante following the bestial slaughter of his family. He then proceeds to go mental, embarking on a rampage aimed at tracking down each and every culprit. Sadly, even with two movie remakes, The Punisher's most memorable villains, such as Kingpin, have yet to put in a showing. Substituting for their deviance, John Travolta renders half-heartedly menacing Howard Saint, a local business mogul driven to hate Castle due to his son's death in one of the G-man's acclaimed undercover operations. Saint, prodden on by his decadent and sultry wife (gorgeous Laura Harring of Mulholland Drive), orders the execution of Castle's family, who are reuniting for the first time in years in Puerto Rico, and thus a new chapter begins. Castle reinvents himself as The Punisher, donning the famous logo on a crusty old T-shirt, and rehabilitating an equally hopeless GTO into a monster street machine fitting of a crazed executioner. He also goes into hiding, residing in a decrepit part of town right next to a group of losers he soon befriends. Castle's relationship with one his neighbors, a down-on-her luck waitress played by Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, reveals him as a protective, powerful individual bursting with social instinct, yet is largely left for subsequent entries in the franchise to deal with. Through cunning setups and sheer luck, The Punisher eradicates the guilty on his list of evil-doers. Within occurs little gunplay, which may prove a let down for lead freaks, but overall the action feels balanced and satisfying. Choice scenes include a destructive one on one with wrestler Kevin Nash, and a torture sequence featuring Will Patton's spectacularly unnerving depiction of Saint's right hand man, Quentin Glass. These set the stage for a finale so over the top it's funny. Once again, the film succeeds in harking back to some of the best, corniest action hero antics ever conceived. The Punisher 2004 produces unimpeachable sensations of primal glee at witnessing its unabashed content. While certainly not too gory nor explicit, the film's laudable decision to go with an all-out R rating separates it from run-of-the-mill PG13 chaff. And it makes sense, seeing as most other pictures in the respective genre these days only go part of the distance, teasing with macho attitudes but shying away from hardcore language and visuals. The Punisher opts for walking the walk. Highly recommended in the proper context, and a regular sight for sore audiences with plenty of laughs to go around.Rating: * * *",The Punisher
153,scott-sw,The Punisher comes to life.,8,23 February 2008,"Although I found The Punisher the grittiest and darkest of the comic book to movie craze, it also comes off very well. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an undercover agent working against the crime lords of Florida - Howard Saint (John Travolta). In one undercover operation, he kills one of Saint's sons. For retribution, Howard and his wife want Castle's entire family dead. Now for the clichés of all revenge movies. Castle is retiring, and his first order of business in the Florida Keys is a huge family reunion with his wife, child, father, mother, and just about everyone else. Castle tries to save them, but can only helplessly watch them all die. The Saints try to finish him off as well, but by sheer luck, he survives. Castle is blown into the water to be reborn as the Punisher. He finds a small apartment when he fortifies his position. Once he finds the prosecutors have done nothing to apprehend the Saints, he broods, drinks, and plots his punishment against those who wronged him. In the apartment, he meets three neighbors: Joan (Rebecca Romijn), Dave (Ben Foster), and Bumbo (John Pinette). They think they know who he is and they reach out to him. Castle, though, withdraws to his private brooding. Deftly, he plots his revenge (I mean punishment) against the Saints. Not only does he find a way to strike back, he pits them against each other in order to let them do his dirty work. At the outset, I will say this pushes the boundary of a normal revenge movie. People will find it depressing, hateful, spiteful, and downright uncomfortable. They will question Castle's motives as well as his methods. However, maybe that is good. Perhaps we need to be squeamish on those things. It will get us to look to Neitzche's saying: ""When fighting monsters, be sure not to become one."" The first thing I liked about this movie was Thomas Jane. He was able to give the Punisher a depth of realism that did not trivialize his pain or make him a mindless revenge machine. Seondly, I liked the trio in the neighborhood who reach out to him. Many people did not like them, thinking they were comic relief. I disagree. Instead, I think their purpose was to keep Castle from going over the edge into insanity. They kept him human. Third, I liked the story. Sure, it was clichéd, but it worked as the best revenge movie since the original Death Wish. We have interesting villains, good characters, and a story that unfolds at a normal pace instead of being non-stop over-the-top action. I know critics and comic fans did not like this one. Perhaps it was too serious, dark and gritty for the pure escapism offered by the comic book movies like Spider-Man or X-Men. Still, this is a good one that captures the same dark atmosphere of the Punisher comics.",The Punisher
154,filmbuff1970,Dolph was better,8,7 October 2004,"This was something i was really looking forward to. What a huge letdown. Thomas Jane acts like a guy who has just lost his sock, not his entire family. His new neighbors are the worst creation in history. Travolta is so weak as the bad guy, it's hard to believe his evil empire. The movie has plenty of action, though none of it is actually exciting. The best performance comes from WWE Wrestler Kevin Nash as a Russian and he does not say a word. That fight scene is the best thing in the whole movie. The script is bad, the characters are mostly boring. I have to admit Dolph Lundgren was far better in the 1989 version he looked seriously messed up, And the villain was far better as well.

He is not your ordinary superhero with powers derived from an animal. He is just one p***ed off dude with lots of guns. Brilliant. When i heard about this movie i was a bit skeptical because i thought Hollywood would screw up the great story. I was wrong. This movie was just as good as the original. Thomas Jane made a better Frank Castle than i expected. This Punisher was a more clever one than Dolph's, who was also great. He tricked and embarrassed his enemies instead of just shooting them, though there was plenty of that too. There was some classic action scenes especially the fight with the Russian and the final scene at Howard Saints' building. Howard Saints was played by John Travolta , who once again makes a terrific villain. Along with his hot wife played by Laura Harring, they plotted to destroy Castle's family. Speaking of hotness, Rebecca Romijn and Samantha Mathis were also in the cast playing Castle's new neighbor and deceased wife, respectively.Critics are bashing this film for some unknown reason. Probably because it is not a 5-hour long character study about a dentist assistant or something. This is Marvel movies at their best no matter what those losers say. 8/10",The Punisher
156,drawlife,"Flawed, but underrated.",7,22 November 2014,"It's very fun. What makes this film work is Thomas Jane's performance as Frank Castle. He nails this role like the way Robert Downey Jr. or Hugh Jackman nail their performances as Iron Man and Wolverine. He's that good and that fun to watch on screen. Frank Castle aka The Punisher is one of my favorite Marvel characters, director and writer Jonathan Hensleigh does a good job bringing the character to life. Combine that with Thomas Jane's performance, it's pure gold. The characterization and performance of Frank Castle is the film's bright spot. Action sequences and the kills are fun to watch. Hensleigh pays tribute to many action films from the 70's and 80's, one particular is the scene where Frank's wife and child are dead pays homage to Mad Max. The film does a great job building up Frank Castle's arc. Here is where Johnathan Hensleigh poured his heart and soul into. Everything to do with Frank Castle is all pure gold, however the same cannot be said for the villain. John Travolta does a pretty good job being a merciless business man Howard Saint, and he is obviously has fun with the role. Even so it's very cliché and very two-dimensional despite some good moments. The supporting cast is good, some have more prominent roles than others. This is a very grim film, but it also adds some layers of levity to ease some tension as it provides some decent humor coming from Ben Foster and John Pinette who portray his neighbors Dave and Bumpo. Eddie Jemison who at first is a lackey for the Saint's becomes his inside man and provides some good wisecracks. Rebecca Romijn portrays Joan, a neighbor and potential love interest, but her character isn't very expanded and is just sort of there. Will Patton is Howard Saint's right hand man and he also delivers a good performance as he gets all the dirty work done for him, but he isn't very fleshed out either. Although The Punisher's plan is set up brilliantly, I found that it took forever to get it going, I understood what was happening, but I felt as if he could have moved forward with the plan at a more faster and accelerated rate. It only slows the film down in some parts. But make no mistake, when his revenge or so called ""punishment"" plan is fulfilled, as an audience member you will be pretty darn satisfied. The Punisher is good film, and out of the three attempts that were brought to the screen, this one is the clear champion. It's not perfect, but it's fun and provides many tense and cringe- worthy moments and plenty of violence.

To strive and never give up until the Saint's are punished. This version of The Punisher is as close to it's comic book roots as it comes. it's a dark and gritty tale of revenge, redemption & sorrow.

159,Skragg,Hit and miss revenge / superhero film,7,5 July 2005,"Partial spoiler. I generally liked this one when I saw it two nights ago, except for a few big things. First, it had two hugely (deliberately?) aggravating comic relief characters. In all fairness, I should say that I saw stretches of the movie (including their scenes) with the volume down. That means that, either I didn't get a full picture of them, or just the opposite - that they were capable of being irritating even WITH the volume down. All I know is that, during that drawn-out scene when the villains were holding them at gunpoint, I found it hard to remember which side I was supposed to be on. My other main complaint is with the way Castle got rid of the ""Livia"" character - by getting her husband to suspect her, and then murder her. This is an idea (borrowed from Othello) that was used in Theatre of Blood with Vincent Price. And it worked very well - IN Theatre of Blood with Vincent Price. But NOT in a revenge story of THIS kind, somehow. (It just wasn't part of the ""formula"" of this one.)",The Punisher

Local crime boss Howard Saint (John Travolta) however is enraged at the loss of his son who was killed in the FBI sting operation in which Castle participated.

With his criminal business being threatened, Saint must unleash his dogs of war to hunt down Castle.During this time, Castle also becomes a surrogate father figure to a group of social misfits living in the same Tampa boarding house as him. They include meditative waif Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), the timid, overly face-pierced Spacker Dave (Ben Foster) and the chubby, slow-witted opera lover Mr. Bumpo (John Pinette). He initially wants nothing to do with them, but slowly begins to form a bond as they try to unlock his hidden demons. However, as the level of violence Castle inflicts increases, so too does his fear that once again those around him will have to pay for his actions.""The Punisher"" manages to shine for its noble attempts at humanizing its characters. Unlike the previous 1989 version starring Dolph Lundgren, the characters aren't just undeveloped machines of vengeance, amoral criminals or helpless victims, but actual people who think and act on their emotions. In an era of action movies when people shoot first and ask questions never, this is a pleasant deviation.""The Punisher"" is certainly not as great as it could have been. The plot seems to jump forward at times, and completely missing is the comic's current dark humorous undertone spearheaded by Garth Ennis. Also, like with the previous adaptation, the movie is not very loyal to the character's origin. Something is lost by removing Castle's Vietnam vet status, which gave his near superhuman control of firearms and martial arts a much needed bit of realism, as well as the relocation from New York to Tampa Bay which ruins the gothic nightmare vision of the comic.Still, the film will most likely not disappoint fans. Director Jonathan Hensleigh gives the movie a dreary and gritty atmosphere, and thankfully depends mostly on tangible screen action instead of relying on computer animation to tell his story. His music video style direction sometimes betrays the story he's telling, but for the most part he keeps everything just as it should be.As the Punisher, Jane manages to keep a proper grimace throughout the story. He certainly acts the part, though he lacks Castle's commanding presence. The one thing Lundgren has over Jane is that he actually looks like an unstoppable monster.Travolta certainly fits right in as comic book villain. As Saint he is suave but psychotic, calculating but prone to angry fits. But most importantly, Travolta gives him a much needed human soul. Deep down is ruled by the same vices as everyone, he just has the wealth to act upon them.As far as quirky characters go, Joan, Dave and Bumpo provide a much-needed level of levity and humanity to the proceedings. All three actors wisely underplay their roles, which is certainly a feather in the cap of this movie considering the current action movie trend that louder is better.Really, the biggest complaint against ""The Punisher"" is that there really isn't that much action, but then the action that is here is quite brutal and haunting, so perhaps that for the best. While it may lack the visual flare of ""Kill Bill,"" it makes up for it with the no-so-subtle reminder that violence destroys people's lives.There's an ancient Chinese saying: ""If you go seeking revenge, dig two graves."" The Punisher is a man who has already dug his own grave, but he wants to bury all evil in the world with him. In such he is damned because he'll never be happy, and perhaps that is the ultimate testament against vigilantism. Still, what is here is compelling and should provide a cathartic release those who want to see the guilty punished, if only in fantasy.Seven out of ten stars. A very haunting and unexpectedly moving rendition of the Marvel Comic, but too disloyal to the origins of the character for the hardcore fans and fails to crank up to the appropriate action levels.",The Punisher
161,cordaro9418,Move over Dolph Lundgren....,7,14 September 2008,"The Punisher has finally hit the big screen. Though Lundgren's film was a huge hit... in New Zealand and Down Under where it was released, it stood as an OK action flick, but not the gritty comic icon it could have been.Both films do some justice to the character in their own way, though this version follows along more closely, if not slightly inflated. A far better acted fare with star power, the characters are right off the comic pages and work as Frank Castle should. Jane's Punisher is just as gritty but much more fearsome.One can hope that a sequel will follow at some point, but standing alone, it does quite well.",The Punisher
162,ram-30,Stan Lee mission to outdo the 1989 version.,7,23 January 2005,"Marvel movies have come along way since the 1989 version of ""The Punisher"". The action and special effects notwithstanding, this film is better written than the original film and much of the recent Stan Lee produced movies(The Hulk, Spiderman 2). What stands out for me is the Shakespearean scope of the tragedy: we have the bloody assaults of MACBETH, the family revenge of HAMLET, and a fabricated infidelity plot of OTHELLO. The acting is by no means Stratford worthy but neither is the original. Thomas Jane is as capable and convincing as Dolph Lundgren.The action is non stop and makes this film seem a lot shorter than the 2 hours that it really is. Both ""Punisher"" films are adult films(18A) and are too intense for young viewers. Parents need to be aware of this. Anyone 18 years old or older, enjoy.",The Punisher
163,jfcthejock,A Great Violent Guy's Night In Flick,8,17 June 2008,"OK, this is not Marvel's first outing into the world of ultra violence as we've seen with Blade but Punisher is in my view another great violent but gripping film that has came into our lives. Playing on the idea of justice and punishment rather than vengeance, this film walks the tight robe of a strong belief in our world and society even today. Even with the usual amount of carnage and gore, this film in my view takes the idea of Punishment from a vigilante on a criminal and the law being incapable of getting the victim justice.Again with a Marvel title, we get the usual facade of action and suspense with Thomas Jane's acting and of course John Travolta. I won't brag on about the film's hidden message as most will know what it will be, but this film delivers for all you action junkies and of course fans of the Punisher. All in all this was a great film, and i'd watch it again and again any day. I'd recommend it for most guys, but remember to be aware that this is quite a dark and gory film.",The Punisher
164,Batkid1,Decent revenge story with an excellent performance by Thomas Jane.,8,10 August 2007,"This is one of the few decent Marvel superhero/comic book adaptations that is actually quite enjoyable. I enjoyed the trilogy of ""BLADE"" films, loved every single ""X-MEN"" movie, thought the original ""SPIDER-MAN"" was fun ( was bored during part 2 and 3) and loved a couple of DC Comic adaptations as well. Anyway, this comic gives you the general idea of the comic book, for me at least, due to having only read a couple of random issues of it & other comics. The movie is very brutal, dark & grim and, while possessing slightly a little too much of each element, manages to deliver an entertaining & explosive experience. Thomas Jane has had bit roles in film before, but he kinda makes you wish that he was taking more lead parts due to his professional attitude. Dennis Foster plays a computer whiz, John Travolta is a little ""over-the-top"" and Rebecca Romijn shows a soft side so eventually the film pays off on supporting cast. Recommended for Action/Adventure fans or comic book fans.",The Punisher
165,tbyrne4,Great stuff,9,24 July 2006,"I really dig ""The Punisher"". To be honest, I don't really go in for superhero films. When I was fourteen, they were great but now as I'm getting a little older, I don't know....there's so much CGI. I feel like I'm watching a cartoon with half of these superhero movies!! Half of the action looks so patently fake! I sit there and look at the action and wonder, ""how can people be enjoying this when it looks so damn fake!!!!!"" Plus, I just don't buy the grandeur. When I was thirteen or fourteen, sure. But now, I just can't get swept up in Spider-man saving the world. Don't get me wrong, I respect Stan Lee and the comics and Sam Raimi, its just not my thing anymore. I don't buy it.Which is why I totally love ""the Punisher""! It's just like the comic books I remember loving as a kid. It's down and dirty and mean. The character isn't presented as some kind of deity saving humanity. He's a renegade secret service agent turned vigilante. All he dishes out is revenge!! Nothing more, nothing less. He's not fighting crime and grinning for the camera. He drives a souped-up piece of junk car and dresses in black and carries huge guns. As far as I'm concerned, if you're going to make a character out of a comic book - that's the kind you should make.Another thing I totally love about the movie is the structure. The beginning sets the audience up PERFECTLY. We see Castle as the nice family guy with a happy life, with a loving wife and child. And all of that is brutally, sadistically ripped away from him before our very eyes. After this terrible display, WE (the audience) want to SEE him dish out punishment. We can't wait to see it happen. Call me old-fashioned, but this is the kind of character motivation a superhero needs to have.Frankly, I am not interested in Spider-man's torment over not being accepted as a normal human being. I could care less!! That will not pull me into a story.True, ""The Punisher"" is somewhat like ""Sin City"" in the darkness of tone, but I really think ""The Punisher"" is a far superior film. ""Sin City"" visually was stunning, but dramatically it was an absolute mess. There was so much killing, so much revenge, so much talking, so much plot, by the half-way point I didn't care about any of those friggin people. Give me something simple like ""The Punisher"". This is cool stuff.A lot of people have written about ""The Punisher"" ripping off ""Mad Max"" and yes, I can see this. They are very similar, but big deal! Directors rip each other off all the time. Look at it this way: at least he ripped off a great movie instead of a lame one.Acting-wise everyone in it did a great job. Travolta made the perfect villain. As Castle, Jane is strong and believable and brings a human dimension to a character who could have been played as purely physical (had they hired an action star along the lines of Arnie). Rebecca Romaijn was good as Joan and has more chemistry with Jane than Samantha Mathis did as his wife (so maybe its not a bad thing that she bit the dust in the first fifteen minutes).Really a good film. My personal advice (though this would probably never happen) when they do the sequel would be to go with an even more 1970s feel to it and even shoot it on 16mm, like Rob Zombie did with ""Devil's Rejects"". I think that would be super cool, and I will definitely see the sequel",The Punisher
166,DarthPaul85,"Not your typical ""Good Guy""",7,16 April 2004,"I really did not know what I was getting into when I bought my ticket for The Punisher.  I knew of him, and I saw the old Punisher movie (1989), but this one captures him like I didn't expect.I have come to expect comic book movies to portray the main character as ""nicer"" or more audience friendly than he/she may be in the comics.  For a while, I expected the Punisher to be the same way- a hero with a strict (although hidden) ethical code, who beats the badguy with superior moral judgement, and of course, we know things are going to be ok from now on at the end.Without going into details, I'll just say that the punisher is not the kind of ""hero"" you want your kids to idolize.  Think of Mel Gibson in Payback, mixed with Batman, and the Count of Monte Cristo.The Punisher is dark, unforgiving, and merciless.  Comparatively, I think he makes Hellboy (the movie version) look like a boyscout.  Fans of the punisher's grim justice will be pleased.All in all, a pretty good film, especially for a Lions Gate production. 7/10",The Punisher
167,markymark70,The only people punished by this film were those who watched it.,3,25 March 2009,"I am a fan of the idea here - a vigilante killing bad guys with no need for the law to get involved. Similar to Judge Dredd, Max Payne, Death Wish etc. And after looking at numerous positive reviews on IMDb re: this film - I was looking forward to watching it. Boy was I disappointed.This is one of the worst big budget movies I've ever seen. A quick plot synopsis: Howard Saint's (drug dealer - John Travolta) son, is killed during a drug bust in which Frank Castle / Punisher (Thomas Jane) was involved. Saint has Frank's family killed, and attempts to have Frank killed - but he somehow survives. Frank embarks on a quest to get revenge on Saint, his family, and his henchmen.The film is poorly done. The audience is forced to suspend their disbelief beyond acceptable limits. Somehow, the main character survives being shot multiple times at point-blank range and shoved off a pier. He is rescued by some witch-doctor-type and nursed back to health. Not only ""health"" but ""super-human strength"" too. There is not much ""realism"" on show here - as the Punisher seems to have an unlimited supply of cash nor ever gets bothered by the cops. Not only that but the Punisher is again shot in the chest twice in the climatic battle and continues on as if it was a paper cut.The dark nature of the revenge motive in this film is completely wiped out by the bright cinematography and pastel colours of Miami. Plus the posturing and obvious posing by the main character - how many times did he look off camera in a 'don't-mess-with-me-i'm-hard' kind of way? - ruins it. One or two poses - you may get away with but after 10 - it gets a little tiresome. Not to mention stupid.Also - and I really don't know what this scene was meant to portray - the most ridiculous scene in the film sums it up as a 'not-to-be-taken-seriously' flick. Castle is having breakfast in a diner and this Mariachi enters, takes a guitar out of a case and gives a terrible Johnny Cash impression whilst singing Castle a song. It turns out he is a bounty hunter trying to kill Castle which he tries to do outside on a (conveniently) deserted road/bridge afterwards. Why didn't he just save himself the bother and shoot Castle through the window he was sitting next to and save the audience the embarrassment of having to look at / listen to him in the diner.To finally cap this terrible film - the hero sets off a load of explosives in the end, forming a laughable flame skull ala his T-shirt / Film's logo - whilst all the time serving as a background to his pretty 'I'm hard' pose!!! Laughable.The only people punished by this film were those who watched it.3/10",The Punisher
168,HiddenVoice,Could've been so much more than a mediocre film.,6,28 January 2005,"The only good thing about the film is the Titular Character THE PUNISHER.He's no superhero, he's got no superhuman strengths .All he's got is loads of guns and enough lifeline to survive an attack.He can't be killed because ""Frank Castle is Dead."" and he can't die again.The character is unique in the comic book genre.He punishes criminals and gives justice to people and that's what makes this film so cool.About the rest of the movie ,it's disappointing !The dialogues were poorly written and the direction wasn't satisfying .Although Tom Jane fits as PUNISHER but he couldn't do much with the lines he was given.Trovolta was wasted and so were the others.The fight scenes were the only decent thing to watch in the film, yes,THEY ARE EXPLOSIVE.But overall it is nothing but a mediocre film.This movie was just a moderate success.But it's the character that is well presented.He can really exist in real life.**1/2 out of 5",The Punisher
169,gamay9,One More Thing,6,7 January 2015,"What distinguishes this film from the typical 'get even' scenarios, like 'Billy Jack' and 'Dolan's Cadillac,' amongst other vigilante vignettes, is the bit of comedy derived from Frank Castle's 'apartment' neighbors. The man with the piercings should enliven veterans, especially those who have been POW's and tortured. I'm sure Senator John McCain would be proud of him.The acting is far better than most films of this genre, as is the script. Casting John Travolta (who has lately made a few films where he is the villain)and Tom Jane is a wise decision.I stayed up until midnight (late for me) to watch this film on IFC, despite numerous, frequent and lengthy ads.If you like extreme violence, this film is for you. I am a Vietnam veteran and don't usually watch films like this. I would just as soon forget, but was endeared to the protagonist and his friends/neighbors.",The Punisher
170,ChrisTreborn,Good Plot made Bad by Wrong Director,1,29 December 2004,"This was one of my most anticipated movie of 2004.But when I watched it, I realized how fool I was!The Punisher (Spoilers******)Ex-Marine and now undercover G-Man Frank Castle (Jane) is retiring from the force. He decides to take his wife and son to a family reunion with approximately 30 family members. Howard Saint (Travolta) finds out that the undercover cop, who was supposedly killed along with his son, is still alive. He sends his own man and personal executioner, Quentin Glass (Patton) -- to take care of some unfinished business. Saint's wife Livia Saint (Laura Harring) wants more than a little vengeance.As a matter of that Castle and his entire family gets slaughtered like cattle except Frank Castle survives. After being nursed back to health, he slaps on a skull T-shirt and proceeds to play sneaky games. The Punisher? No..just a pussy version of it. Blame one man for this crap and that is the writer/director Jonathan Hensleigh (writer of ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"" in his directorial debut). A fairly simple formula (you killed my family..Now it's payback!) was treated ridiculously.Instead of focusing on Frank Castle's hurting payback, the flick decided to explore his strange neighbors tubby Mr. Bumpo (John Pinette), piercing guru Spacker Dave (Ben Foster) and super model looking Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). It should be said that all three characters were derived from the comic...but they just didn't work in the film! Their presence was deviates the story away from Castle and his immediate goal.For humor (or what) we get a surprise fight scene inter-cut with fat dude singing opera and dancing with his male friend. Also Punisher photographing (and staring) Gay kissing couples.And the excruciating soreness didn't stop there. Frank Castle actually vanished from the film for a good part of the middle section with the poseur mobsters and the dumb ass neighbors getting more air play. Funny, I thought this was Castle's story. To add insult to insult, the flick failed in putting out the necessary tone. Thomas Jane (The Punisher) don't even have the look (He supposed to be an expert, freelance crime fighter were Jane is still 'some one else' in the movie except in the climax and closing scenes).Before director Jonathan Hensleigh came onto the project, Michael France (co-writer of ""Cliffhanger"") was working on the screenplay, which contained elements of the 12-issue ""Welcome Back Frank"" mini-series written by Garth Ennis. France's script was then re-written by Jonathan Hensleigh.That all makes this movie '.1' out of 10",The Punisher
171,crazyrabbits,I was punished beyond belief...,1,26 December 2004,"Man, this movie sucked hard. How is it possible to make a movie with hardly any backstory, incredibly lame acting, and hardly any violence at all? Being a comic collector myself, and as a long-time reader of the Punisher comics, am I supposed to believe Frank Castle is going to spend months stewing over the death of his family, and then methodically plotting and trying to systematically destroy the Saint family one by one? HE'S THE PUNISHER, FOR GOD'S SAKE! He kills people with no remorse! He doesn't sit around plotting and preparing! He's a friggin' walking army! This should be nothing for him. All that aside, the acting also sucked, and was incredibly bad. How do you expect me to care about Castle's roommmates if you don't give them a bloody backstory? I laughed when that slacker got his piercings ripped out. Also, the acting sucked pretty badly as well. There were even lots of plot holes as well: why didn't this movie take place in New York? Why didn't the police even bother to help Frank (in the older series of comics, Castle actually worked in conjunction with the police)? How does a person get shot three times (even in the heart!) and get blown off a dock by an explosion, even have survived? What's with the sudden appearance of the skull T-shirt? What the hell happened when Castle was taken in by the fisherman? If Howard Saint knew where Castle lived, why did he send in the Russian guy first? He could have sent in a squad of armed men and just finished Castle off for good. And what about the singing assassin? What was that all about? Nonetheless, this movie sucked badly. Don't watch this.

175,joliet-jake,better than the first one,8,6 December 2004,I thought that this movie was very well put together and Tom Jane played a great Nick Castle. There is a lot more plot development and character devlopment for that matter in this movie than its predecessor. If you like action movies this is one of the better ones that have come out in a while. It was also cool to watch Castle restore the GTO and turn it into his Batmobile. The movie is much better than the one that came out before it. We see a lot more action and just an overall better movie. If you like the comic version of The Punisher then you will like this movie. Check it out 8 out of 10 stars. For this movie. Lost of action and good story and plot great movie.,The Punisher
176,Netscape_Navigator,I can respect the fact that for ONCE they didn't cater this movie to kids,1,16 November 2005,"The entire first act of this movie where they establish the back story of Frank Castle felt very artificial. It's like they were just going through the motions to setup a basic revenge story, but when it's setup with such bad storytelling and plot holes, the viewer doesn't have any emotional investment in the characters. The plot holes I can handle, I can simply suspend belief, but there's nothing to be done about bad storytelling.In the beginning, once I realized this was going to be a bad movie, I was just waiting for his family to hurry up and get murdered in hopes that once we got into the main portion of the story, it could at least live up to basic action movie standards, but it failed to even do that.There were two things that made me shake my head the most about this low quality movie. First was Frank Castle's female neighbor and how they tried to make it seem like she was really interested about Castle and sincerely cared about what happened to him, to the point where she's almost ready to cry when he sets off on his mission. Give me a break, they just met, she has no reason to feel THAT attached to him. It's a joke how they tried play up this whole concept of this loner character that enters her life to rescue her from her pit of emotional hell, or whatever the hec her issue was. Waste of character, waste of time.The other reason I shook my head again was the other neighbors, the slacker kid and the fat dude. First of all, other than being a combined waste of flesh due to little to no character development, there was one scene that was completely unrealistic. When the slacker kid is getting interrogated as to the whereabouts of Castle, why is he sooo defiant?? Why would he act all aggressive to a group of thugs who are probably armed and prepared to render him into a bloody pulp? OK, so he's showing loyalty to a guy that saved him from a bully earlier, and refusing to disclose information now, that's fine, but WHY NOT AT LEAST LIE?? Why would you want to sound like you DO have information that the enemy wants, just aren't willing to disclose it? That's just retarded. Once the skin starts getting ripped off your physical person, that's the perfect time to say ""OK OK, I'm willing to talk, he went out the door, in that direction, etc,"" even if it is a lie, there was absolutely no reason for the enemy to doubt what he said.",The Punisher
177,rchrdshelt,Best Action Movie for a long time,9,24 October 2004,"I would have given this a 10, but ended up giving it a 9 for 2 reasons. Firstly, because I saw it on pirate and therefore the scenes may not have been as good as they should have been as the picture wasn't perfect and secondly because there should have been one or two more action scenes. Other than that, this is a really good movie. I had been looking forward to seeing it for a long time being a big fan of Jonathan Hensleigh's movies and this one does not disappoint.The opening 30 minutes is very good, but also quite disturbing. Especially the scene where Frank Castle's family were completely wiped out, but Hensleigh stages it and the rest of the movie really well. It moves very fast actually. I've noticed a lot of people complaining about it being 2 hours long, but I found it to be very fast moving and I never got bored I have to say. After the opening 30 minutes it does slow down slightly as Frank begins to tease John Travolta by crumbling down his empire of money along with his wife and pal. This is also well done as a subplot and is quite interesting.The Punisher's neighbors were funny as well and are likable. The good stuff really gets going when Travolta sends two hit men to murder The Punisher. They are both quite funny characters and the action is really good involving both of them. The first is a car-chase and the scond is a huge fight in The Punisher's house. Anyway from there onwards the suspense builds up really well towards the end which is definitely the best bit of the movie. The Punisher invades Travolta's club and there is some great gun fights and explosions that follow.The reason I liked this movie the most is because of the realistic old-fashioned action, as CGI seems to be taking over these days, which is a shame I believe. Anyway as I said at the top I felt that there should have been one or two more action scenes in the middle, but I suppose with the short budget of $30 million they had, I suppose they couldn't do much more.The acting is very good, especially from Jane and Travolta as the two leads, but the very underrated Will Patton is also good as well along with the rest of the supporting cast of hero's and villains. The movie is very dark, just as it should be although I'd like to have seen this at the cinema but was unable to as it is rated 18 and I am only 16. But ah well, still a good movie and should have done much better than it did at the box office having being unfairly mauled by the critics as too dark. What the hell were they expecting from a dark comic book! I also noticed several critics criticising the violence and the the fact that The Punisher character is depressing. Why the hell shouldn't he be! He's had his whole family wiped out for goodness sake! He has no-one left now, surely you'd be a little p****d off if that happened to you and you'd be out for revenge. I certainly would! This deserves a higher rating than 6.2 and judging by ratings movies get on IMDb, I say it should be between 7 and 8. But some users on here disagree, probably because they don't understand the concept of revenge and the dark, uncompromising nature of the comic book.Bottom line here is watch this movie if you love your action or revenge films. This is one of the best action movies in recent years and I can't wait for the sequel as there is likely to be one judging by the end of the movie. Check it out!9/10",The Punisher

Judging a movie solely from what is seen on the screen, having no knowledge of the film or it's characters, Is a terrible way to review a film. Read a comic book for hells sake, this film is one the absolute best comic book adaptation out there, even with the Marvel cinematic universe films and DC universe films, even obscure films like the Crow. The point is this film does everything right, from a dark and disturbing back story, that again critics thought was to violent and disturbing, which the director handled in a true to the comics fashion. The Punisher is and always has been a very violent, disturbed and often psychotic behavior, made him unique among comic book heroes, he broke the mold on traditional heroes, the exact characteristics of an Anti-hero. The movie has and excellent performance by Thomas Jane as Frank Castle is just awesome!!. Couldn't have picked a better person to play him on film. Punisher: War Zone, is also an excellent version, although I'm more partial to this one, it has great drama, plot twist, amazing action and a great villainous character in John Travolta, who I just hate in this movie, because he so good in the role.

It is not intended as great cinema or some terrific social statement.  I grew up reading and loving comics and that type of story is what we have here. The story is not original (revenge is a popular theme lately) but, as in a comic, you rely on the graphics, characters and action to spur your own imagination and entertain you.  Most comic book stories are really not that unique (how many times does a hero's wife/girlfriend/mother/etc have to be killed/kidnapped/threatened by a bad guy?) but it is how the dialog is done and the visuals that help you enjoy it.  Here, there is nothing to distract you from the pretty clear story.  There is comedy (the neighbors), there are clear bad guys and there are big battles (the one with the Russian seeming to leap right out of a comic book).

182,beastwarsfan,The Punisher owns!,10,21 March 2006,"The Punisher no doubt is one of the greatest comic book adaptations so far and one of the best (if not the best) action movies from the past 5 years. I love it. I fell in love with this movie from the very beginning - the black background, the falling white cartridges, the titles and the main theme. It has a spaghetti western feeling. On second thought - I actually fell in love when I saw the trailer - ""They killed my family... They thought they killed me... But they were wrong. DEAD WRONG! (kaboom!) This is not vengeance... not vengeance! It's PUNISHMENT!"" I guess you can describe this movie as Mad Max plus Sergio Leone plus classic 80s action movie. It has all the classic motives - broken family, ruined life, inner demons, friendship, a girl in danger trying to help, revenge... It has all the classic elements also - spectacular killings, duels, arrows, explosions, stone cold lines, even the armored car! The script is great, the score adds to the atmosphere, Tom Jane is excellent... The result is something really worth watching! You identify with the characters, you understand them... I hated John Travolta's character so much that I was thinking ""Oh, they have to come up with a really nasty death for this bastard!"" - and hell yeah! He kills his wife and best friend for nothing, both his sons are dead, he's beaten up, shot, put on fire, chained to a moving car and blasted! I mean - how cool is that? The movie reminds me of the good old days when the studios didn't care much about ratings and weren't afraid of rate 15 or 18.",The Punisher
183,DesertDogMedia,The Punisher,8,3 August 2014,"Title: The Punisher Condensed Storyline: Frank Castle, an undercover FBI agent has his family killed and him left for dead. This makes him go out for blood and kill the people who killed hiss family. Notable Acting: Thomas Jane plays our anti-hero Frank Castle. There are some actors who just own their roles, such as Robert Downy Jr as Iron Man and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Thomas Jane is the Punisher, he just plays the role too well for anyone else to be him. I didn't really care about anyone else as they were not as connective as Thomas Jane, but I can say that I did like the big bad of the movie, but not as much as the main character from an acting standpoint Costume: The skull painted onto the bulletproof vest is one of the few trademarks of the Punisher, so is the long leather coat, so they got the costume pretty dead on. The actor actually looks like Frank as well, this is what makes his character perfect. The Russian on the other hand isn't as good, even though he looks almost the same as his comic counterpart, minus the scar on the eye. His shirt has the stripes too close together, this is why everyone makes jokes about him being a ""Soviet Where's Wally"" Incorrect Science: Horse shoe crabs are not string rays Overall Feel: The Punisher was created to be a villain for Spiderman back in the comics, but was so popular that he was made into an anti-hero who takes the law into his own hands. This movie feels like an anti-hero movie and even borders on not feeling like a comic book movie at all, because the Punisher is just a guy with guns. No powers, no high tech gadgets. Just guns and guts. This movie reminds me a lot of Blade, because it is a great action movie which makes you forget it is a comic book movie and has little to no romance in it.",The Punisher

Okay so there have been a few changes but no more than when the Marvel comic books themselves rewrite the characters history. The film manages to stay faithful to the comic and retain the original atmosphere of the Max editions.Whether you are fan or not this ultra violent action film is well worth watching...",The Punisher

186,ARTaylor,"Good Action Flick, Decent Comic Book Movie",8,20 June 2011,"Punisher can be a tough nut to crack. The problem with any antihero is finding the balance between their dark actions and noble motivations. Wolverine is searching for who he is. Hulk is looking for a place in the world. Magneto wants to prevent another Holocaust. Like Batman, Frank Castle is merely trying to avenge his families. But unlike most heroes, he is fully willing and able to kill anyone and everyone to do so. Adapting that into an interesting movie so that audiences care about the character while he does those things requires extra attention.Despite all the complaints against the film, it is actually quite good in a 70s-80s classic action film kind of way. It's like Dirty Harry doing Die-Hard level action in a Hamlet-like story. The movie's certainly not Shakespeare but it's entertaining if you like those old Schwarzenegger and Stallone movies. Big guns are fired, things blow up spectacularly, and people die in testosterone-fueled scenes. Like the 80s action movies, there several moments of humor to lighten up the story without making the characters seem comical, like the scene where Frank ""tortures"" Mickey or uses the fire hydrant.The story is simple and straightforward. Frank's family is killed and he goes on a rampage to avenge them. These kind of big, loud action movies never are very complicated. Probably what holds the movie back the most is that it uses a well-worn superhero origin story. Regular life, tragic accident, becomes a hero, saves a few innocent people, and faces the bad guy. It wasn't so bad at the time. Spider-Man and Daredevil already used this exact same template. But since then, I write this just after the release of Green Lantern, far too many movies have used the same exact template since and it becomes hard to distinguish between them outside of the visuals.For a first film from Hensleigh it is well done. The action is exciting and there's a certain amount of style to make it his own. The acting is good, though not overly great. Jane and Travolta do terrific jobs. Of the three live-action Punishers, Jane is certainly the best of the bunch. It's sad that they couldn't get him to come back for the next one. If they did do a fourth, I certainly hope he comes back. Travolta has fun in the villain role much as he did in Face/Off. Of the others, Romijn is sexy and Pinette is funny but the rest are not particularly notable. The score by Siliotto is also very effective with several catchy themes.Is the film a great example of any genre? Not hardly. But it's fun nonetheless. It's a gritty and realistic approach to the comic book character and not so over-the-top to be silly. If you're looking for a good action movie, this one is worth a watch. If you're looking for a good superhero movie, well, there's certainly worse ones out there.",The Punisher
187,tj_director,"Not Perfect, but a fun dumb action film that could have been a lot worse.",6,7 February 2005,"I know nothing about the comic book, so i have no idea of how good an adaptation it is, i can only judge it on its own merits. It is probably the least inspiring comic book film, it is at the end of the day just an action movie which echoes the type made during the 80's.. now for me that's a good thing, i love modern day action films, where brains have been put in, but i do miss some of those silly mad action films of yonder year, where if something can blow up, it WILL.The film knows not to take itself too seriously, the fight with the Russian being a particular highlight, even when our hero is being beat up to hell, its still manages to be funny.the weakness of the film, much like Daredevil (which i thought was very poor), stems from the director doing a more or less debut film, and it being an action film at that, know the action scenes are done fine, but inexperience shows in more or less every other scene, and it brings it down a bit, some of the dialogue between Jane and Stamos is really very bad, then again so were those great dumb action films of the 80's.this is a tongue in cheek action film, don't take it too seriously, don't see it as a comic book adaptation, then i don't see why anyone wouldn't mind watching it.BUT i do feel there was a missed opportunity for this film, the last shot is really great, and i imagine sums up what the rest of the film should have been like, had the last shot been the opening, the film could have been something pretty cool.. but ends up being a fun bit of popcorn.",The Punisher
188,medic249a2,Awesome action flick with a good story,9,9 July 2004,"So far, next to Spider-Man 2, 'The Punisher' is probably my favorite movie of 2004. Although I'm not familiar with the actual comic character, the Punisher seems more human than most comic book heroes, mostly because he does not have 'super-powers' like most.***WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD***When a wanna-be arms smuggler, Bobby Saint, is killed in an FBI illegal weapons sting, his father - a criminal-minded businessman named Howard Saint (John Travolta) and his equally twisted wife (Laura Harring of 'Willard') instruct his henchmen to kill the entire family of the FBI agent in charge, Frank Castle (Tom Jane). These low-lifes, led by crooked lawyer & accountant Quentin Glass (Will Patton) and Saint's surviving son Johnny, gun down Castle's wife, son, parents and about 30 other relatives at a Puerto Rico reunion. Though badly wounded, Frank Castle survives the assault, and returns to Florida to go after the sociopathic Howard Saint and his criminal enterprise. When he discovers that the police & courts are either unable or unwilling to act against Saint, Castle becomes 'The Punisher', arming himself to the teeth, outfitting his car like a tank, and slowly gathering information on Saint and his thugs. He starts by psychologically torturing information out of Saint employee Mickey Duca, and then formulates a plan of attack from his low-end apartment/hideout in Tampa. Next to go are two men who were also responsible for the massacre - gunned down by Castle in Saint's office building after he sends $50 million raining into the street from a window. Enraged at the disruption of his criminal enterprise and the failure of his men to kill Castle, Saint sends additional thugs after The Punisher. All meet the same fate - severe bodily injury or death. The Punisher plays psychological cat-and-mouse with Glass & Livia Saint, tricking them into terrible fates. Then, the Punisher returns to Howard Saint's club for a final confrontation with the sociopathic businessman and his thugs. Most will not survive - including Johnny Saint, who meets a grim end at the wrong end of a land mine.***END SPOILERS***Tom Jane's portrayal of Frank Castle/The Punisher gives the character a very human face, more so than in most comic-inspired heroes. He shows the very human feelings that come with a severe loss like his own, and the messages that his neighbors Joan, Bumpo & Dave give him are ones that most of us might expect to hear. John Travolta - who is playing more villains these days - is his usual expert self in a role as the despicable Howard Saint. The character comes across as one the audience can genuinely hate, as does that of Livia Saint (Laura Harring of 'Willard', in a sharp contrast to the gentle & compassionate office temp she played in that movie).
I did not consider this a mindless action flick. The violence, although there's a lot and it's sometimes grim (such as throwing boiling water into a thug's face), it's essential to the storyline. There's enough of a story to sustain the action sequences and it's well used. Bring on 'The Punisher 2'!",The Punisher
189,brodlimmel,You can't make a good Punisher movie,5,26 August 2011,OK I am not the biggest Punisher fan but someone said check this out because of the violence. Well they were right about the violence but they forgot to mention that the violence is done better in other movies and the fact you really just get bored watching this film. There are many flaws with the film the fact that it does take so long before he is the Punisher that bothered me he has the simplest origins.So for those who don't know this starts out with Frank Castle's family being killed because he got some mob bosses son killed when he was doing undercover work. It shows basically how he becomes the Punisher and take revenge on the men who killed his family. It is a simple simple story yet they still manage to bore me by trying to show the human side of Frank Castle. He got his family killed thats sad but honestly they show why he is what he is in detail we don't need to continue to go back there and be reminded.The acting is really sub par at best Thomas Jane as the Punisher he seems to damn depressing then being a bad-ass. John Travolta as the mob boss Howard Saint he seems so nonthreatening like he is a pushover. I guess I was looking for more comic book type of characters they went with a more realistic type thing going on. Except the fact there are no cops in this town people are murdered in broad daylight and no one cares at all.Overall this is some olé bullshit I don't think even the fans of the Punisher would enjoy this film.,The Punisher

It was well directed, everyone with major rolls did awesome at the parts.  I loved how it was such a dark movie.  I loved this a whole lot better that the one with Dalph Lundgran.  This movie was an action packed ride, non-stop.  Go see it, the only disappointment was that there was no Stan Lee cameo.  John Travolta does a great job as the bad guy.  There weren't a lot special effects but for the most part it was not needed.  It was different to see Rebecca Romajn normal and not in the blue costume dressed as mystik. Over all this movie was awesome.  I am definitely seeing the movie again tomorrow.  To see what I might have missed.",The Punisher
191,Jakethemuss,Recommended to fans of the genre,8,22 September 2007,"I haven't yet read the Punisher comic books, so can't give an opinion as to whether its a good adaptation. But lets just say, I find it unlikely the film didn't do the comic at least a little justice at worst. It came across as a tense, exciting and explosive picture that kept me watching and waiting to see how it played out. It is filmed in such a way I found myself truly hoping Frank would get revenge and do the world justice by evening the score.The plot is nothing new, but rises to be more than just another revenge flick. The opening scene sees Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) as an undercover cop out to bust a smuggling operation by a docked cargo ship. The bust happens, but ends in the death of criminal kingpin Howard Saint's (John Travolta) son, who was one of the buyers at the deal. Howard is looking for names to associate with the death, and is informed of Frank Castle's participation in the bust. He orders the death of Frank, but his wife goes one step further and cruelly requests Franks entire family to be wiped out.Soon enough Saint's thugs pay Frank's family a visit at a secluded beach retreat, which ends in a bloody massacre. An attempt on Franks life fails, which is the biggest mistake Saint's henchmen had ever made. Frank returns after a little recuperation, and sets about tracking down Saint and closing him in.The way in which he goes about getting his revenge is brilliant. He becomes an angel of death, a true vigilante, a stone cold reminder of what happens when you screw with the wrong guy. Armed to the teeth and trained to kill, with nothing but vengeance on the mind, he steps into the one man army suit quite well. This film does not disappoint with the violence and combat scenes, it does not hold back. It combines dark humour with gritty drama, and a sense of impending danger as Frank goes about his business.",The Punisher
192,chimera3,Worthy of the Comic,9,21 September 2017,"I don't even count Dolph Lundgren as Frank Castle. His version of ""The Punisher"" pales in comparison to this one by leaps and bounds. With Thomas Jane at the helm, he brings Frank Castle to life in this version that is worthy of the source material. Mr. Jane is an action junkie that never fails to impress. ""The Punisher"" is not supposed to be this cheesy PG-13 character with corny dialogue that makes sense to no one and has no energy when it comes to eliminating the villains; he is the take-no-prisoners, R-rated warrior who tells it like it is and isn't afraid to get his hands bloody along the way.I have always been partial to revenge movies and this one is no different. From beginning to end, it keeps you on your toes. Blink and you might miss something. Seriously. Unlike some revenge movies that have no plot, this explains literally everything: Frank is a veteran FBI agent who takes out a kingpin's son, Frank and his family are marked for death by the kingpin's wife, Frank moves away after being nearly killed, Frank prepares himself for taking out the villains, Frank moves on to other villains. It is just that simple.Good music, good action scenes, even some pretty memorable dialogue. I saw this movie when I was 17 (one of many where I had to show my ID without hesitation) and I have never stopped watching it. For any action junkie or a comic lover, you will not be disappointed with this one. I highly recommend it. ""The Punisher"" is not supposed to be sunshine and rainbows; it is the way it is: dark, gritty and violent. That's all there is to it.",The Punisher

194,RandomTask-AP,Another `Somebody's Done Somebody Wrong' Song,5,21 April 2004,"SPOILERS INCLUDEDRevenge is a difficult dish to serve. The appetizer has to properly prepare the main course so one can truly enjoy the flavors that come out of it. Rather than speaking metaphorically, it means that the hero has to be likeable enough and crime heinous enough for the audience to root for the guy who is doling out all the brutal karma to those that wronged him in the first place. The character is spot on and the crime is brutal enough in this faithful big screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' `The Punisher', but the mix isn't quite right. (Although far better than the 1989 adaptation with Dolph Lundgren in the lead role.) What we are left with is a solid enough revenge story that should have taken a cue from its own hero that it might be more fun (and successful) by breaking some rules of story telling instead of connecting all the dots in order.Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is a top-notch undercover FBI agent who has lost the taste for his profession and is retiring. Unfortunately, one of the casualties of his last sting operation was Bobby Saint (James Carpinello) a son of drug cartel money launderer, Howard Saint (John Travolta). Saint doesn't take kindly to one of his twin sons being killed by an FBI set-up, and orders his men to find and kill the one chiefly responsible. That puts former agent Frank Castle unknowingly back into harm's way as he attends a family reunion. Saint's men track Castle down at the joyous family occasion and proceed to slaughter everyone (at the request of Mrs. Livia Saint, played by Laura Harring) in attendance including his wife and son. Saint's men mistakenly leave Frank for dead, and after some glossed-over medical attention, he is free to re-emerge as the vindictive Punisher. The rest of the movie is Frank/Punisher finding increasingly violent ways to get under Saint's skin, dodging his friendly new neighbors and trying not to succumb to too much Wild Turkey.The film takes the whole first act setting up and destroying Frank's family. It's admirable to try and give validity to characters that are nothing more than the literary carrot that keeps Frank moving forward. However, this moviegoer had a difficult time buying any member of the family. They were simply too perfect. The tolerant wife, the grizzled grandfather and the whole smiling show of the family reunion was too inconsistent with the rest of the movie. The only hint of reality was the slight resentment Frank's son had about having to relocate for Frank's job. The movie starts to have fun once Frank has set himself to revenge and donned the black T-shirt with the trademark skull.The comical scene where Frank tortures mob lackey Mickey Duka (Eddie Jemison from `Ocean's Eleven') by convincing him that a popsicle is really the too-hot touch of a blowtorch is more true to the spirit of the movie than anything that has to do with his family. (And that scene is the real beginning of the adventure promised in the trailer.) The movie's focus is rightly on the thrill of revenge and reckless freedom in Frank's incarnation as The Punisher. Building some mystery by introducing the ruthless Punisher first and flashing back to bits of Frank's old life and tragedy would have been more effective than spending so much time on poorly characterized people we know to be doomed before the credits roll.
There is some creativity breathing in the design of this rather traditional revenge thriller. Travolta has the sophisticated psycho role down cold, and still manages to bring sincerity to Howard Saint, an original character not found in the comic books. Thomas Jane's commitment to the character is unwavering, and he becomes The Punisher completely. His gravely delivery, squinting eyes, hard body and dyed black hair are worthy of any comic book cover in the series.  Frank's new home in the slums of Tampa, Florida has three other residents: Dave (Ben Foster), Bumpo (John Pinette) and Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Staymos in a brilliant bit of red-herring casting). These three cast members add well-placed levity and humanity to the story. They are getting by in their wrong-side-of-the-tracks lives, and are friendly enough to want to know more about the mysterious brooder who has moved in down the hall. It takes some accidental meetings and a sneaky invite to dinner, but they do get him to open up just a fraction. This is just in time for the film's most inspired scene where the neighbors preparing desert and lip synching to opera music is juxtaposed with Frank fighting for his life against a huge assassin who has tracked him down. Frank's twisting Saint's own fears to the point where it culminates in Saint killing some of his own is brutally ironic. However, that playful spirit goes out like a light when the final showdown between the Punisher and Saint comes about. It's back to brutal revenge again, and all the pyrotechnics in western Florida can't brighten that.With some reordering, the movie would have been raised a few notches. Comic book fans will want this to succeed more than it does, and action fans will get their dose of thrilling sequences. Revenge tales are nothing new, and the formula will stay appropriately the same until eternity comes to pass. The details are all right and full of surprises. (The spring-loaded knife was great, as was the champagne bucket.) However, keeping the tone focused is the crucial thing missing here. Marvel Comics has proven that raising the bar on comic book movies can make them very entertaining. While Frank might get his revenge, his fans certainly deserve a little something better.5 out of 10",The Punisher

202,danielloe,"A good story, but gets a little too crazy",6,11 June 2015,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* The Punisher is a very mixed bag for me; a lot of things work, and a lot of things don't. Let's start with the positives. First of all, Thomas Jane as Frank Castle. Big positive. He fits the character perfectly, he's menacing, and he really does a good job of feeling broken inside, which makes him all the more sympathetic. The massacre of his family is done very well; it is really tragic, seeing all these people just getting gunned down ruthlessly, and you find yourself cheering when Frank and his dad find a pair of shotguns and get a little pay-back. I think the tone of the movie is, for the most part, pretty good. It is dark, but it has a little levity to brighten things up. Some of the jokes work, some don't. His neighbors are pretty silly, but I appreciate that the movie wasn't all gloom and doom (unlike the original Punisher movie). Now let's move on the negatives. Okay, first of all, the villains. They're not good. John Travolta plays Howard Saint, who basically just sits behind his desk saying some of the most ridiculous lines ever. Also, Travolta just can't act that well. Saint's other son, John, is better, but he's disposed of very poorly, and doesn't even get a fight with the Punisher. Quentin Glass also needed to fight The Punisher, before his death, which was pretty clever. Harry Heck was a better villain, but he too was killed off way too fast. And as for the Russian, they did pretty much all they could've with him. What this movie needed was a villain that was constantly going after The Punisher, who could lead the attack, such as Glass or John Saint. Alternatively, we could've gotten more out of Heck and some other assassins who could be plaguing Punisher for a while before he finally has a showdown with them and guns them down. The same problem I had with the villains is connected to my problem with the action. We have some pretty cool fights, but every enemy is disposed of in their first encounter with Punisher, so the action just becomes routine after a while. Also, at the ""big"" finale, I wanted to see Punisher take on more guys than four guards and a roomful of guys who weren't killed by the bomb. Saint even says earlier that he had a lot of guns... so where were they? Some fights were also way too short, and it was just, Punisher walks up, and people die. In conclusion, The Punisher is an okay movie, pretty much anyway you slice it. As a popcorn action movie, it's alright, as a superhero movie it's alright, as a crime revenge movie it's alright. Still, I did have a lot of fun watching this movie, and if you can put up with some occasionally bad acting, some plot holes and a few flaws; then I'd say check it out.",The Punisher
203,kububeach,Stupid plot. Bad acting. Pathetic.,1,14 November 2020,This movie is just terrible. Predictable but unrealistic plot. Just typical revenge movie with a bland storyline. They were trying to insert some comedy but they just failed flat. My biggest problem is the bad acting. They even made John Travolta to be so dull.,The Punisher
204,TonysLittleFriend,At least the shirt rules,5,3 September 2004,"Out of every film this year that i have wanted to see the most (Other than Kill Bill Vol. 2 of course), The Punisher was number one. I have known about this film for quite some time, and the fact that i would be disappointed never entered my mind for a second, but alas.The ever so classic yet pathetic story about Frank Castle goes as such:Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is a man who has seen too much death in his life, first as a Delta Force Op and later as an FBI special agent. He has managed to beat considerable odds, and is finally moving out of the field and into a normal life with his wife, Maria (Samantha Mathis), and young son, Will (Marcus Johns). On his final assignment, Castle plays his undercover role perfectly, but the operation spins out of control and a young man, Bobby Saint (James Carpinello), is inadvertently killed.This places the FBI on the wrong side of Tampa businessman Howard Saint (John Travolta) and his glamorous wife, Livia (Laura Harring). Notwithstanding their glossy social profile, the Saints are no genteel Florida couple; behind their copious wealth are violent beginnings, underworld ties and a chilling capacity for brutality. Inflamed by the death of their son, the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance. Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true, as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion. But Castle, to his everlasting torment, survives. Until this moment, he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law. However, experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalize the people who murdered his family.Drawing upon all he has learned in 20 years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers. He takes up residence in a dilapidated tenement building in Tampa's industrial district, where his fellow tenants include Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), a waitress at a nearby diner who is trying to put her life back on track; Dave (Ben Foster), a gangly twenty-something with a face full of piercings; and Mr. Bumpo (John Pinette), a rotund gourmand who rarely leaves his home. IIn preparing his revenge, Castle thoroughly familiarizes himself with the habits and routines of the Saint family. He traces the movements not only of Howard and Livia, but also their surviving son, John (James Carpinello), and Howard's second-in-command, lawyer Quentin Glass (Will Patton). Armed with this essential knowledge, Castle launches his first salvo against Saint's business interests. Stunned that Castle is not only alive but causing him harm, Howard Saint marshals his forces in an attempt to shut Castle down. He soon turns to the underworld's network of hired assassins, recruiting the laconic Memphis legend Harry Heck (Mark Collie) as well as the blonde behemoth known only as the Russian (Kevin Nash). Castle's plan is proceeding apace, but his mission has the unintended effect of placing his fellow tenement dwellers in danger.Yet Joan, Dave and Mr. Bumpo rally for their neighbor, even at great personal risk. This makeshift family forgotten men and women with no one to protect them brings Castle the one thing he least expects: redemption. His personal goal achieved, Castle realizes that his life's work has just begun. As The Punisher, he will provide justice for ordinary people and exact retribution from society's villains.The villain in the film is mediocre at best. About half way into it, you start to get the feeling that he doesn't stand a chance against Punisher. Speaking of which, one of the things a LOVE about this film is that it shows that Castle is human. He CAN be beaten, and almost is. In fact, one excellent scene in the movie (One of very few) he fights a Russian.The Punisher does win the fight, but it is not him who kills the Russian really. That was a great scene. At times very humorous. But the films major action scenes come right at the end. And it lasts no more than five minutes. The musical score in it ultimately, sucks. The music in it is good though. I would suggest waiting till it comes to PPV or TMN.**/****",The Punisher
205,mrphantasm,It was not the perfect adaptation but still it was very good.,9,26 January 2005,"Before watching the movie fans had some things floating in their head they wanted to compare viewing the film. The Punisher is not a hero he is an anti-hero everyone knows that .He is a psycho, the most appealing and convincing maniac but a psycho at the end. The movie should reflect that. (SPOILER) The adaptation luckily didn't try to exorcise the demons from this man, at the end he continues with his one-man war. This movie uses some of the support cast of the Welcome Back Frank saga and that's very satisfying. One of the details that didn't fit with the Punisher's essence is alcoholism. Frank Castle is a dedicated and self-disciplined man; the original character uses this as tools to keep his mind clear he didn't need booze to get through the lost of his family. Anyway this kind of character development is a trade mark of Hollywood cinema and it didn't spoil all the good things of the final result. Other variation in the adaptation is the profession of Frank Castle, here he is a federal agent with a high rate profile in special operations. The original Frank was a hero of war, a marine. But the translation from marine to federal agent is not illogic because Frank still is a man marked by violence. The way Frank's family is murdered also is different. Killed in Central Park in a Picnic or killed in family reunion that is not a drastic change.John Travolta is one the best actors portraying villains and his Howard Saint is a mean bastard just the way it should be, Tom Jane did a good job reflecting all the hate that keeps Castle moving from one place to another, it is really hard get inside the head of an actor all those negative feelings. The absence of CGI it is refreshing. How nice is to see some real explosions and stunts a la Die Hard, or other hits from the eighties. And some raw and necessary violence, very necessary because Punisher is an executioner. Jonathan Hensleigh's work is agile and professional , he didn't wrote very interesting movies (except Die Hard with a vengeance) but he proved he is able of write (adapt) and direct this kind of story.",The Punisher
206,swipht1,Great revenge movie,8,24 April 2004,"The PunisherThomas Jane, John Travolta, James Carpinello, Rebecca Romaijn-Stamos, Laura Harring, Will Patton, Ben Foster. Directed & Written by Jonathan Hensleigh.The Punisher is one of many revenge movies to come out in recent weeks. I can say without a doubt, it was everything I expected. Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) is an FBI Agent who just goes into retirement after an arms bust, in which a young man is killed. This young man's father, Howard Saint (John Travolta), goes out to get the man who did this to him, Frank Castle.Castle's entire family is murdered, including his wife and child. He himself is shot several times and set on a dock and lit on fire. He somehow survives, and goes after everyone who did this to him.The Punisher is a non-stop thrill ride of violence. There are new and spectacular ways of killing people. The action was very intense and well done. The acting was better than I expected, especially from John Travolta. Besides the action, there was also good plot development. Castle making friends with the people who live in the apartment is also good.Some of the action was unrealistic, which is expected. This is Hollywood; what can you expect? All in all, this is definitely the best revenge movie I have seen in a long time. 8 out of 10.",The Punisher
207,SnobbyDude,If you keep complaining that sci-fi/comic movies are unrealistic...,10,24 April 2004,"Before I get started on my review, I just want to get this out of the way:If you keep complaining that sci-fi/comic movies are unrealistic, then you really shouldn't go to see these types of movies.  There are so many people that just don't get it and I find myself getting very frustrated.  These movies are supposed to be unrealistic and it's up to the audience to sit back, relax, open up their imaginations and suspend disbelief for a while. If you can't do that, then this is the genre isn't for you.  When people open a comic book, they want to escape from reality (in a good way) and let the imagination run wild.  These movies are not supposed to be grounded in reality.I go to the movies to be entertained.  That's what I pay for.  All of these new comic book movies find different ways to ring my bell.
X-men challenged my mind by exploring social issues & society.  Daredevil was gritty, and had the brilliant rader concept.  Hulk was a thinking man's action movie, with lots of character development.  Spiderman was a feel-good hero movie that felt a little superman-esque.Punisher is a different take on these comic book movies.  They skipped the sugar-coated nature of spiderman and went straight for an R rating.  This is not for the kiddies.  I can't really recall seeing a more violent movie. The action does serve a purpose, however, so it isn't like the horrid Matrix sequels where people are fighting for no reason.There are some of the best one liners I've ever heard.  Some of the dialog doesn't work, but we are only talking about one minutes worth in an entire movie.SPOILER--------------------------------------Despite one or two lines that didn't work, a lot of material did work:-The fact that your typical, predictable hollywood romance scenes weren't inappropriately inserted is great!  This is a grim movie, and sappy love scenes don't belong here.  When I heard Castle say ""I'm not what your looking for"", I was so happy.-No sermons are here.  There are some hints here and there about morality and a lot of ideas are introduced that are thought provoking, but no answer is crammed down your throat.  If anyone has seen American History X, they'll know what I mean.  You are weighing all these different ideas in your head in AMX and then all of a sudden you are slammed with that ""hate is baggage line"".  I can make up my own mind and we did that on our ride home.-Yeah, there is violence, but has it ever been filmed this way before? After each fight scene, I was saying, ""wow, I never saw a move like that before!""  Who ever saw someone kill someone with a paper slicer?  A lot of action movies get boring because we've seen it all before...same moves, same way of killing people.-Interesting villains Like the russian and the guitar player from memphis.-Lack of CGI.  I like CGI, unless it is taken too far like the cartoon like matrix reloaded.  Some people, however, complain on and on about how fake things look, ect.  If there was CGI here, I didn't notice.End of my spoiler section-----------------------------------------I was entertained despite the movie's flaws.  Some people have different criteria when it comes to judging movies.  They look at a film and see a few flaws and knock off points because of these imperfections.  For me, the most important thing is that I enjoy the movie and am entertained.  I had a good time watching this one and even went back a second time to see it and I liked it just as much on my second viewing.",The Punisher

This movie kicked ass then, and it still does now. It has summer action movie written all over it. Simple revenge plot done well.Thomas Jane was a great choice for The Punisher. John Travolta has proven time and time again that he can play anything, whether it be a dancing machine from Grease, or a villain of any kind.When it comes to summer action blockbusters, make sure this is on your list.",The Punisher
209,Jester69,Worst comic adaptation ever...,3,27 June 2004,"Wow, what a piece of crap. After seeing the trailers I really thought this would be an OK movie. Put it this way,the unreleased Fantastic 4 movie was more entertaining. The only thing this movie has going for it is the skull t-shirt. The original is much better and anyone who saw that knows it was no masterpiece. The main thing wrong with this flick is that it was boring.It felt like a made for TV movie with some added violence. It was just...dull. Travolta did his worst acting of all time, jane was well, just there. I love the character of the Punisher and this was just a major disappointment.

211,codeE,Unapologeticly violent,9,28 September 2004,"I liked this movie a lot. I was blown away by not seeing an exploding car and a CGI tire narrowly missing our hero's head. Equally shocking was no one did any gravity defying high flying martial arts. Then I completely lost it when I realized there was no bullet time. Had these people not been watching movies for the last 10 years. Next thing you'll tell me the hero wont sleep with the hot girl. I can just imagine pitching this idea to the suits, ""O.K., it's a comic book movie with no CGI, no high wire martial arts, no love interest and it's rated ""R"" so no kids can see it!""

A+",10,4 October 2005,"This movie had everything a Marvel comic fan could ask for, great leading characters; great story that stays true to the comics; low campiness; and high appeal... finally, a Punisher storyline that does the character justice.A lot of people like to compare and contrast this 2004 version and the 1989 version, which is kind of pointless since the two versions are complete opposites. They seem to think the 2004 version deludes the character; he doesn't ""avenge"" as wantonly as he should. All heroes/anti-heroes have some traumatic events that made them who they are.The 1989 movie was set in the character's ""adolesensce"" after all the horrible events of his life got to him and made him into the unbridled psycho-avenger we know and love. whereas the 2004 one takes place at the beginning of his madness,; it shows us the character's descention into madness. In effect, throughout the movie is Frank Castle, at the end Frank becomes the Punisher. 10/10",The Punisher
213,nvjs,Lackluster homage to the venerable character,6,1 July 2012,"As a simple-minded revenge flick, ""The Punisher"" might have fared better since it dis-appointed core fans. What I thought was sorely missing, was a more emotional Thomas Jane. Instead we get a stoic, brooding Jane who obviously has more talent than that. Travolta's character was un-inspired and a hammy one at that. I'd like to have seen a pompously and gleeful Howard Saint instead of one who looks like he'd rather be doing something else like flying his jet.There was a few shout outs to the source material like the Russian, Bumpo, and Spacker Dave. Even the scene where Castle hangs Mickey Duka inverted for some ""interrogation"". But I feel it was not Hensleigh's doing, rather Avi Arad's insistence. I didn't like the cop-out setting of... Tampa ? What's wrong with Toronto for NY ? Overall, the film is predictable and bland with flat acting as well as directing. What miffed me was that Hensleigh had the audacity to slam real, established directors as having ""superficial"" and flawed cinematography. Hensleigh made his directorial debut with this ""movie"" so to be slamming anyone seems naïve and infantile. All that to differentiate his approach to ""directing"" this movie rather than ""...nostril cams and cameras in the coffee can perspectives"". I'm sure he arrogantly and un-justifiably thought that he was gonna set a new retro/trend by going back to the era of low-tech film-making had ""The Punisher"" set a new box office record of 100 million in it's debut weekend premiere. I guess his ""old school Leone, Peckinpah ways"" just don't make amateur film makers brilliant ones.",The Punisher
214,willhaskew,Flawed but satisfying revenge action film,7,25 April 2015,"First of all, the casting for The Punisher role itself was dead on. Thomas Jane was a fantastic choice and his on screen transformation from loving husband/father and dutiful FBI agent to coldly raging antihero is incredible. His on screen wife, Maria (Samantha Mathis), son, father (Roy Scheider) and the rest of his family die in a heartbreaking scene that's also a little disturbing. The villains aren't quite as well cast. The bulk of the story takes place in Tampa after mob boss Howard Saint's younger twin son was killed in an accidental shooting during a sting to catch arms dealers. John Travolta was a bad choice as the main villain Howard Saint, he seems to be overacting and ineffectual. Laura Harring as Livia Saint wears the pants in the family, as Howard Saint's coldly vindictive wife she orders the deaths of Castle's family, and is far more effective a villain. The same goes for Will Patton as Quentin Glass, the Saint family attorney and chief enforcer, who is portrayed as a gleeful sadist and murderer.",The Punisher
215,sebbezw,A lot better than the crappy original,8,29 April 2006,"I think that there is more people who have seen this one than the original. And of those people, there are surely a few persons who are a bunch of hardcore action-fans who probably wants to see the original. Well to those guys I say: stick to this one! Dolph Lundgren was the original punisher, but Thomas Jane kicks Lundgrens ass! If you see the original, it gets real clear that he is the worst actor in the world, and when you see this one with a brilliant Thomas Jane as the punisher, the comparisons between those two gets ridiculous. Dolph was nothing but a bored wannabe-Schwarzenegger and Thomas really suits the role as a punisher. He gives the movie more character and he shows that he can be both sentimental and an assassin. Dolph cant be neither.Thomas Jane is a great actor, but he is not the only one. John Travolta makes his best job since Pulp Fiction. He proves that he can be a real bad guy too. His character cant be compared to the bad guy in the original since they are far from each other. But one thing can be settled: John Travolta makes an excellent job in all different situations in this movie. His character react very different in different situations, and Travolta handles 'em all.Not only the two main actors make the movie great, the script is sharp-witted, the action scenes are superb directed, the story is greater than in the original and the bad guys are more trustworthy than in the crappy low budget first one. What this movie proves is that a movie based on comics don't have to be filled with action to the maximum. Of course, there has been great based-on-comics-film filled with action, but there are still more drama and thriller in this one than the regular comic-movie, which is great.What more can I say? Well, this still isn't perfect. Some of the other actors neglect a few times and the beginning is a lot slower than the quick end. But bad actors has been seen in a lot of great movies and the tempo problems in this movie aren't as devastating in this one as they were in Kingdom of Heaven, for example.This movie is great and should be seen by everyone who likes action. What makes this movie better than the regular action movie is that this is intelligent action, which you don't see very often.",The Punisher
216,Kezzizzle,I liked this one,8,24 November 2006,"I bought this from BlockBuster when it was on offer with other DVD's. I had never heard anything about it before, or even seen a trailer. I just read the back of the DVD and thought ""this looks good""...and boy was I right.The first few scenes are completely necessary...you learn about the main character and his family and his occupation. Within the first 45 minutes, I was so upset and I actually shed afew tears. Yes, an action film made me cry. It is one of the most awful things ever. You feel so much pain for the main character, and I couldn't stop thinking about what had just happened...but i won't say what happened as I don't want to spoil anything.After this awful scene...thats when the action really starts to happen. You feel his anger, and you feel that he wants revenge so badly....you feel he wants to punish! Sit back and enjoy as this is what I call a good tacky action film (but in a good way)...with afew laughs and afew cringey bits. ENJOY! :)",The Punisher
217,Lord_Crypto,One of the Best Comic Book/Action Movies,9,5 July 2007,"Being a huge fan of action movies like Die Hard, The Last Boyscout, or Lethal Weapon, I expect just a few things from my action movies. Violence, vulgarity, and crude or any real humor is what I want to see. And being a huge fan of the Punisher comic series, I was expecting to see a good film and not just a good action film with those 3 qualities. I ended up with all of them. The Punisher is a brilliant film! An absolute thrill to watch and I could not have been more pleased with its outcome!Acting is pretty good in this film! Thomas Jane does a wonderful job with The Punisher and Frank Castle. His Frank Castle character may seem too one-sided or too tough from the start of the movie up to his transformation point but other than that, his Punisher character is terrific. His character is so perfectly dark and unemotional and he does a perfect job of portraying it. John Travolta does a fairly descent job with his villain, Howard Saint. Will Patton is excellent with his character, Quentin Glass! He comes off as being a very dangerous and scary individual. There is also a lot of other good supporting actors and characters in this film! Of course, I am talking about Roy Schneider! This movie is automatically good because Roy Schneider is in it.The story is very good! Jonathan Hensleigh and Michael France created a great story which I really liked. It was good to change the story around from the original Punisher comics origin. In the comics, Castle and his family stumbled onto a gangland execution and they were executed for being witness to it. It seems more believable to make him an undercover/protected agent in the film and I really like it. One thing I highly disliked is how his entire family had to be killed off. That does show the relentless and cruel characteristics of the Saint family, but it just seems overdone. In the comics, his wife and 2 kids were the only ones killed. In the film, they kill his entire family. Both his side of the family and his wife's side. That just seems a bit overdone to me.The violence in this movie is great. A guy getting shot in the neck with an arrow, a guy getting his head split with a paper cutter, and one guy getting a knife shoved up through his jaw and into his head. Absolutely terrific! And the Harry Heck character is so funny. ""You are one dumb son of a b*tch! Bringing a knife to a gunfight!"" And than, BAM! Right in the throat. He did not see that coming! Do not get the interpretation I am sick based on my passion for violence but I love how there is distinct variation of killings in this film. It keeps the viewer satisfied and surprised with each and every kill.There is plenty of humor in this film. It is not a bad depiction of humor either. It is all an either dark or serious humor which suits the mood of the film perfectly. Parts like the Popsicle torture scene (taken from an actual Punisher: Warzone storyline) and the fight scene with Castle and the Russian. The Punisher definitely deserves some respect and it is one of my favorite action movies of all time. It may be one of the best of all time. I absolutely love it and think it is a grade A action movie. The only thing left to say is, They had better make the second one.",The Punisher
218,Bioweapon,"Frank GAYstle is ""The PUSSYsher""",1,22 July 2010,"OK, this movie deserves a plain -10, it's a shame the votes go from 1 to 10.anyone that has a MINIMAL clue of what Frank Castle is, anyone that has, at least, taken a glance at Marvel's comic will realize that this movie is plain GAY.Let's go through the character story: a) Castle is an ex ELITE Special Forces officer. For that matter, he is capable of killing you with a plastic spoon. b) Castle lost ALL his family in a shootout between enemy gangs.Take a + b and you get a f****** atomic bomb ready to blow. Tom Jane, as far as I could see is a cheap copy of Christopher Lambert (I remember watching him at ""Mutant chronicles"" while thinking: ain't him C. Lambert?), but that is not the issue here.The issue is that Castle should be a dark character trying to keep his blood lust satisfied (which is not easy), not a tortured soul looking for redemption. And Criminals aren't pussies, like Travolta's metro-sexual villain, they are the worst of the worst. Not to mention that Castle's style ain't putting two bad guys against each other, it is more like ""I'll stick an M-32 though your ass and blow it off while I gut the other guys with a rusty chainsaw"".If you want a true tribute to the comic, watch Punisher: war zone.

222,CC_The_Martian,"Great concept, lackluster execution",4,4 April 2016,"I like the idea behind this movie more then I like the movie itself. Director Jonathan Hensleigh had an idea to adapt the Punisher but in a serious (totally not comic book) way while incorporating stylistic elements from gritty action movies from the 60s and 70s. He approached actor Thomas Janes about playing the Punisher and at first he wasn't interested but when he read the script and saw what Hensleigh planned to do with the character in the film he signed on. The movie's production was also troubled; both budget and time to shoot were both cut in half meaning that Hensleigh had to cut out a lot of the more expensive action scenes, and on top of this Artisan Pictures was bought by Lionsgate during production. Despite all this Hensleigh delivered the movie on time to lukewarm reviews but modest box office success making $ 54,500,000 against a budget of $33,000,000. And yetI'm not very fond of this movie, I like the idea and I admire the work but this movie is a bit flawed. Frank Castle is an undercover FBI agent and family man, he plans to do one last job and retire to a desk job. Unfortunately on his last job he accidentally kills the son of a powerful crook called Howard Saint (played by John Travolta) who gets his revenge by having Frank's entire family gunned down. Frank survives the incident and becomes The Punisher, a skull t-shirt wearing gun toting vigilante with no qualms about killing those who he deems deserving of punishment. This movie's plot is solid. An origin story combined with a revenge plot line similar to a 60s or 70s action movie. The action is well choreographed. And I'm sorry but that's where the good runs out I'm afraid. So such a simple movie there are times it feels needlessly complicated especially involving a certain subplot where the punisher tricks Saint into killing his wife and best friend which was only there as a reference to a similar plot in a James Bond movie. This movie also has a tone problem because the punisher is a harsh concept but the movie doesn't go far enough with it meaning the harsher scenes feel out of place. This is not helped by a horribly out of place, even if funny, trio of comic reliefs and a weak villain. Yes while john Travolat is a good actor he is not in top form here. He simply isn't menacing enough as a villain which in a regular action movie would be one thing but in a punisher movie you need a villain the audience can buy or the punishment seems mean spirited and harsh. Overall this is a weak movie. The good stuff only manages to make this movie average while the bad knocks it down to below average. Thomas Janes gives a good performance and there are some enjoyable bits but the bad knocks it down. I don't recommend this but it's not awful.",The Punisher
223,worship_HIM97,Tom Jane is absolutely breathtaking!,10,8 July 2005,"This movie is one of those movies that make you wonder why every movie isn't as good. However, if you are aren't the type that likes intense violence and content a bit more mature than PG, then I don't recommend this at all to you.Tom Jane plays Frank Castle, a broken and confused F.B.I. agent who loses his family to a band of mobsters, who horrifically slaughter every last one of the members of his family, including his extended family. The pain and anger that he deals with causes him to become what he used to hunt down, a murderer who slaughters criminals day and night. His first target is the man responsible for his family's murder, a man named Howard Saint (terrifically played by John Travolta). The suspense and excitement experienced throughout the film eventually unfurls into a dramatic and astonishing conclusion that movie-goers will never forget.I can't think of anything more to say about this movie, so I will say this: The value of this movie is beyond words. At least 10x better than the original 1989 film starring Dolph Lundgren as the executioner, this is a memorable and unforgettable film that is guaranteed to leave you in awe. 10/10!",The Punisher
224,brandon_foore,Not perfect but still very good,8,9 January 2019,"I've seen both the extended cut and theatrical cuts of this film and in terms of being a feature length film, this was and still is a fine movie about revenge, justice and punishment.Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle/The Punisher perfectly, showing great depth and ability to a stoic character. John Travolta also plays a fine villian in Howard Saint but it doesnt help the character is thinly written to be something more than a cardboard cutout mob boss.As I said, even in 2019 and with Netflix's adaptation being (somewhat) successful this is still a very good movie. It has obvious flaws, especially in the second half but ""The Punisher"" is still a fine film about revenge, punishment, justice and letting go.",The Punisher
225,jxmakela,Not quite as punishing to watch as it might have been,6,22 July 2004,"OK, this movie is bad, but what did you expect from a movie with Travolta in it? Travolta's presence is a virtual guarantee that the movie will be a total stinker (Pulp Fiction is the one exception that confirms the rule, and I'm still cursing Tarantino for resurrecting Travolta's career and allowing him to make lousy movies for another couple of decades all over again).
However, if you don't expect too much, The Punisher '04 supplies an evening's worth of stupid, morose fun. The plot is totally nonsensical as expected and Thomas Jane has the charisma of a brick, but on the positive side, Travolta's performance is slightly less pitiful than usual. The story of Frank Castle's revenge progresses in such a formulaic and predictable way that you can't help but admire the courage of the production team: they're making a movie that been done about a thousand times already, and yet they really seem to believe in it.So for me, The Punisher is undemanding, cheesy, throwaway entertainment. Thankfully my favorite Marvel characters have always been The X-Men and The Fantastic Four. If I were a serious Punisher fan I probably would have been enraged.",The Punisher
226,npfares,A Good Try but still fails in the 'long run',4,23 March 2016,"Thomas Jane, I think, was a great choice to play 'the punisher'. However, due to various acting choices and writing choices for the movie it lacks real intent of the movie. The editing team also takes blame for how poorly this movie was received. It tried, very hard, to be a good comic book movie. But, in the end, it just patronized the fan base. Mostly, due to the company who financed this film not realizing the 'ideal' or 'good' of a Punisher film compared to the comic books. Secondly, casting people like John Tavolta was a horrible choice. He wasn't even close to being believable as the 'bad guy'. In the end, the movie failed to become a good movie because the company you made this movie did not realize that the fan base wasn't looking for a generic revenge movie but a real life character who can kick ass as an emotional and in depth character.",The Punisher
227,mattdvs,Try to stay awake for the ending,5,16 April 2004,"So we saw The Punisher last night.  It was free, and, after it was over, I thought the price was just right.  This isn't to say it's a terrible movie. It's not nearly as bad as some of the crap in theaters right now (I'm looking right at you Ladykillers and Whole Ten Yards).  Anyway, The Punisher, based on the Marvel comic book character, was better than I expected.  However, that isn't saying much because I expected total garbage. It all comes down to how much crap you can sift through before you get to the good stuff.  The following review is of the movie alone, not a comparison to the comic, which I never read.  I understand from reading a lot of other people's reviews that the movie is nothing like the comic.The film starts out with our hero, Frank Castle, participating in a FBI sting operation that goes slightly awry when the son of our villain, who wasn't even supposed to be there in the first place, is killed in a shootout with the FBI strike team.  From there, we cut to Castle coming home to meet his wife, the one-note Samantha Mathis, and tell her he's officially retired.  Much happiness and heartfelt conversation ensue.  The family is happy that Daddy is finally gonna settle down and stop moving them all over the place.  Cut to the Saint family getting the news that their son has been killed.  There's much anger and weeping, culminating in a overly dramatic and comic-booky scene (yes I know it's based on a comic book) where Saint's wife tells her husbands henchman to wipe out Castle and his entire family, who, conveniently enough, happen to be at a family reunion in Puerto Rico. Long story short, after a series of horribly written speeches where each member of the family, Mom, Dad, Grandpa, and even little Timmy (or Joey, or whatever his name is), gets a chance to say a bunch of cheesy stuff that's designed to make us feel for the family, when all we want is for them to get on with the killin.  Speeches over, everyone lovin each other, the massacre begins.  On the order from their boss, Howard Saint, played stiffly and nervously by John Revolta (oops I mean Travolta), Saint's goonsquad, who for some reason dress like rejects from a gay matrix-themed party, ambush the family and kill them all, including wifey and little Bobby, leaving Castle presumed dead and floating out to sea.  Well of course he isn't dead. Somehow, with the help of some voodoo island guy, he gets better, recovering from being shot IN THE CHEST (ummm okay?).  When next we see him, his bullet holes are healed-over and he's sportin' a Castaway-style beard. He finds the skull t-shirt that little Mikey gave to him to `ward off evil spirits' (whatever), finds Grandpa's gun collection, and begins to plot his revenge. Now up to here, the movie isn't too horrible, just kinda dumb.  You can tell by the writing that they're taking source information from a comic book. The massacre scene has some cool stuff but on the whole it's par for the course.  It's from this point through the next half hour that the movie hits it's low point, starting with the meeting of Dave and Bumbo.
Who are Dave and Bumbo you ask?  Well they're Frank's wacky, idiotic, comic-relief providing neighbors who provide the audience a chance to laugh at their wacky, idiotic ways.  I hated these characters.  Hated, hated, hated hated, hated.  Them and their I'm-hot-but-I-don't-know-it-so-I-hang-out-with-these-jerkoffs neighbor Joan, played by comic book movie staple Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. Joan fills the typical woman-in-distress role ably, but blandly.  She wants to hook it up with the punishing one but he's too busy punishing and drinking to notice either her hotness or how easy it would be to get all up in that.  Stupid bastard.  Other annoyingly pointless plot devices ensue, involving a gay villain and a singing, guitar playing hitman.  It's right at this point where the movie really started to p*** me off.
Then all of a sudden it switches gears and redeems itself.  After a cartoony but fun scene where our hero who likes to punish gets his butt kicked by this huge Russian guy (pro-wrestler Kevin Nash), the movie gets very dark, very fast.  Thankfully, it stays that way until the end.  The last 20 minutes of the movie are by far the best part of the movie.  Finally, after an hour and a half of cheesy speeches and wacky neighbors, our hero becomes the guy we've been waiting for, a badass.  After messing around with Saint through the whole movie, playing little tricks and games with him, Castle costumes up in his best I'm-a-badass-but-I'm-still-too-wussy-to-not-wear-kevlar gear, grabs his daddy's guns, and makes his assault on Saint's headquarters. And what a cool assault it is.  Of course, there is still some comic book cheesiness here and there, but the scenes of Frank walking in and cold-bloodedly whacking every person in the joint just about, but not quite, make this movie worth paying for.At the end of the day, see this movie if you can sneak in for free, or see it when someone else rents the DVD.  It's okay for a fun diversion, but not a good movie.  However, if you don't go in expecting Shakespeare out of the script or John Williams out of the score (which is admittedly HORRIBLE), then you may have a good time.  Just take my advice and snooze all you want during the middle, but try to stay awake for the ending.",The Punisher
228,lmayer2,Superb....Punisher is a live-action comic book,8,31 January 2008,"I've always preferred the DC comic movie adaptions to the Marvel ones. There's just so much more to them. But one movie that proves me wrong is The Punisher. It has been one of my top contending comic book-to-movie films. The best thing about this movie is its deep, intriguing plot, garnering an R-rating, besides the regular PG-13 sticker Marvel movies usually receive. It's a break from the ordinary, taking a leap of faith. From the debut directing of Jonathan Hensleigh, Punisher is a thrill ride, as Thomas Jane gives a one hell of a performance. Jane makes very clean transitions onto new acting levels and his role in the Punisher is one of those transitions. Other superb aspects included the performance by John Travolta (in a similar zone as Pulp Fiction) and the editing. It's bearable but maybe the violence is a surprise from most Marvel movies. Nevertheless, Punisher is two thumbs up.",The Punisher
229,VonCouch,No Remorse,3,2 May 2004,"OK, this film had problems. MANY PROBLEMS. MANY MANY PROBLEMS. MANY MANY MANY...you get the point. But the thing that irked me to the breaking point was the complete and total lack of remorse. By anyone. The Punisher had no remorse for his family. Sure, the script said he did. But just because that's his back story, doesn't mean he shows any of it.He watches his mom get shot right in front of him, says ""Mom?"" like she just stumbled over a footstool or stubbed her toe, then just grabs guns and starts shooting. He has no remorse over his mother's death. Then he shoots some bad guys, goes outside with his dad, and watches his father get shot in the back. Again, no remorse. He just knocks the baddie down and runs w/ his dad lying dead. Jumps on a motorcycle. Chases the truck which is chasing his wife and son. Wife and son wipe out, kid hurts his arm, says ""My arm hurts"", easily crawls on said arm to get out of truck. Wife and son run then get run over, when they certainly had an option of jumping off the deck. Punisher finds them, picks them up & grunts an almost-emotion. Drops them and sees pickup truck that somehow turned around on the skinny dock. Forgets about dead family, tries to shoot a freakin pickup truck, gets shot in the chest, left for dead in firey explosion.Travolta also had no remorse. Everything he finds on his friend and wife could have several explanations. If this were an episode of Three's Company, it would turn out they were planning a birthday party for him. Has no remorse for his friend's or wife's death. Just kills them both and goes to the 9th Annual Black Suit Convention, offering them a suitcase full of money to kill a guy who isn't exactly being secretive about his whereabouts.The only ones who showed unnecessary remorse were the three stooges in the apartment building. Piercing Dave, who has been cemented as a weakling, gets every piercing pulled out without talking. When the (surprise surprise) shirtless Punisher asks why, he says ""we're a family"". No. No. No you're not. I laughed out loud at that line. That was, literally, the worst line in the entire movie. And that's a bold statement, with all the crappy, 80's action one-liners we had.OK, so I didn't just cover the lack of remorse. I kind of gave it an all over glaze of crap. But quite honestly, after the first hour I was praying for a fire, tornado, flash flood; just an excuse to leave the movie.CAUTION - DO NOT SCREEN THIS FILM NEAR AN OPEN FLAME AVOID AT ALL COSTS",The Punisher
230,jayce2279,Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need him?,1,14 November 2005,"If Batman Begins is the perfect adaptation from comic book character to big screen hero, The Punisher is the perfect example of how to destroy a great comic book character. The first thirty minutes are boring and unoriginal. Whereas Christopher Nolan made good use of the first half of Batman Begins to present a credible transition from rich man's son to Dark Knight, Jonathan Hensleigh bores viewers to death by picturing Frank Castle as the perfect American family man who then loses his beautiful wife and perfect son in a cheap Mad Max rip off. In contrast, the 1989 low budget but far superior version started off smack in the middle of the action with a seriously disturbed ex cop already on the rampage and the reason for his decline into madness was gradually explained by means of flashbacks and memories form Louis Gousset Jr trying to bring his old friend back into a sane life. But whereas the comic book Punisher, brought to life by similarly huge 6' 6"" Dolph Lundgren in the first movie, becomes a bitter, meaner than hell, cold blooded killer without compassion, the 05 Frank Castle turns into your friendly neighborhood watchman who uses an ice cream cone to ""torture"" his first victim. Batman Begins also has its share of humor, but it is subtle and not out of place. The bad guys don't fare much better. Whereas Jeroen Krabbe also had his share of trouble with the Yakuza in the 80s version, at least he was a serious gangster not to be taken lightly. John Travolta is a looser who can't stand his own against other mobsters and is being pushed around by his wife. Message to all Punisher fans: go rent the 1989 version or just stick to the written word, but don't spent any money on this monstrosity which shows no respect whatsoever to a great comic book series.",The Punisher
231,josephtheowl,A tremendous disservice to over 30 years of history.,1,29 January 2007,"I remember at the advance screening of this, I heard one guy say ""It makes Hellboy look like Titanic."" What the movie did was make the Punisher character much more palatable for American audiences. By making the Punisher two-dimensional and less controversial, they took away the emotional pain and helplessness readers of the comic book sympathized with when the cruelty of life corrupts a good man.In the comics, Castle comes back from a grueling tour in Vietnam and wants to spend the rest of his life with his wife and 2 children in peace. But while they're enjoying a Sunday picnic in the park, they witness a Mafia hit and are subsequently murdered, only Frank (barely) survives. He's a victim and survivor of senseless violence, and when Frank becomes the Punisher, it isn't to ""punish"" the bad guys. He believes that society has gone insane, and his only purpose left in life is to force it to make sense. He's a vigilante and anti-hero, not because he kills or uses guns, but because he couldn't care less about law and order. Which even in real life, have failed countless people.The part of the movie that really took a step into absurdity was when the Saint family's hit men killed his family. His ENTIRE family. I almost busted a gut laughing when one guy tried to escape a hail of gunfire by boarding a dingy. It's like if Batman had his mom, dad, third cousin Scooter, crazy uncle Joe and goldfish Goldy killed. It cheapens the effect of losing the few closest people to you when they show all these other obscure people dropping like flies. I also laughed when Castle's mom got shot in the leg because Thomas Jane's reaction was so unnatural. But by this point the movie was irredeemable anyway.",The Punisher
232,necredeye,Good start to a Great Character,8,10 September 2004,"The Punisher is by no means perfect. Some things work wonderfully, others, while true to the comics, do not translate well into the movie. However, this is an origin tale. These are difficult to pull off perfectly. Hopefully a sequel will come along.Thomas Jane is wonderful, and the bad guys, hey, we like to see them die. The movie is not overly gory, but it is violent. The last 15 minutes is worth the purchase of the DVD alone. This is a tale of Frank Castle slowly becoming the Punisher. By the end of the film, he is The Punisher and he is the Punisher we know and love from the comics.The plot is good, the acting is acceptable, the action is great, Thomas Jane wonderful. I recommend this movie. It is a very fun movie and is in my rotation of ""Go-To"" movies when I'm bored and need some action to watch while at college.a very respectable 7/10",The Punisher
233,StevePaget,A poor example of a comic book movie,3,12 July 2004,"The opening titles are reminiscent of Kill Bill Volume 1. They are animated in a style not unlike the anime sequence from that movie, and the music is a similar sort of mariachi trumpet piece. Of course the Punisher story is basically about revenge, with Frank Castle out to avenge the deaths of his family. Could this be coincidence that they choose to mimic the other great revenge movie of recent years? Maybe Tarantino's stylistic violence might be what the Punisher needs to bring it slap bang up to date. Unfortunately, the similarity ends as soon as it begins.After a bit of back story, we are ""treated"" to the death of Castle's family. This is nasty and very difficult to watch (especially for a new parent like myself). But it's the sort of deal you expect in a film like this. In order to understand Castle's motivation for the killing to come, you need to see and feel his pain. It makes for a savage introduction to the characters, but you sit through it in anticipation of the reward to come. The action. That's where things fall apart. There is very little of the comic-book style action I expected. Maybe that's my fault. The filmmakers obviously decided to make this a much darker, grittier movie than the other spandex heroes recently seen in our cinemas. The main character lives in a grotty apartment with some weird neighbors (more of whom later), and spends most of his time brooding and recovering from various wounds he picks up in his dealings with the henchmen of the main villain (John Travolta's crooked banker Howard Saint). What action there is is fairly brutal, with mostly knives and blunt instruments being used with bloody results. Castle slowly makes his way through Saint's defences, sowing seeds of division as he goes, using his intelligence more than his guns. In fact, the character only properly emerges as The Punisher a whole 105 minutes into the movie. That leaves just 10 minutes of gunplay before Saint is sent to his grave in one of the cheesiest methods ever committed to film. Seriously, if you used to cringe at Arnie's one-liners, wait until you see this. I swore at the screen.I said it may be my fault. I wanted a comic book action romp and they wanted to remake Death Wish. But if that's the case, why did they feel the need to give us the ""goofy"" neighbors who inhabit Frank's apartment block? We have a nerdy, nervy, Shaggy-from-Scooby-Doo lookalike; a funny fat guy (called Bumpo. Bumpo??!) who cooks for everyone and sings operas, and an attractive blonde who would NEVER be living in such a ropey place with such a bunch of losers as these. These characters provide comic relief, though when I say ""comic"" I really mean ""desperately unfunny"" and when I say ""relief"" I mean ""make you want to jab your eyes out with a fork"". They sit very uncomfortably in the piece as a whole, and it makes you wonder what the director Jonathan Hensleigh was thinking.In fact I know what he was thinking. Sequels. This is just a pilot for what they obviously plan to be a series of Punisher movies. All that pain and suffering (on the part of the audience) is just to set up the character so we can enjoy his next movies. If they're anything like this one, I wont be in the audience.3 out of ten.",The Punisher
234,veensepeper,A Western worthy of the Punisher...,9,7 October 2013,"'The Punisher' is a lone anti-hero movie, following the tradition of the Clint Eastwood westerns. The movie is an adaptation of the Marvel comics, but in no respect has it the feel of a Comic Book Movie. Like 'The Wolverine', this movie takes a different route, exploring new territory for the CBM-genre. Making it smarter and more interesting.In 'The Punisher', Frank Castle sees his family getting brutally killed by the Saint mafia, before being left for dead himself. Upon his return, he learns that the police has done nothing, and takes matters in his own hands.Next to getting his vengeance - or as he puts it himself: delivering Punishment to evildoers - Castle regains his humanity. Mostly through his comic-relief neighbours: Joan the Mouse, Specker Dave and Mr. Bumpo.Although some fans claim that Castle went 'too smart' in his Punishing, rather then straight on blasting his enemies - the movie in no way lacks blood and gore. Also, there is ample shooting. But smarting up the Punishment brings the movie up a notch or two.Due to budget, a long car chase is not in the movie. Instead, they put a rather short one in, and that works all for the better. Long car chases have been done a million time, always turn out goofy and kill the suspension of disbelief. The car chase in 'The Punisher' however is short, effective and all the better. Take notes, please.'The Punisher' is both a character study of Frank Castle, as well as a story of ethics. What is justice, can you take it into your own hand? While raising these questions, we get an exciting movie. Turning a comic book into an action adventure can be fun. But 'The Punisher' shows how much more a comic book can be on the silver screen - and all for the better.",The Punisher
235,kraziken,"Thankfully, erases the horrible Dolph Lungren version",7,17 April 2004,"I've been a pretty big marvel fan in my childhood.  One of my favorite characters was the Punisher.The Punisher was introduced to me early in the Spiderman series, and because of fan feedback, he got his own comic.  The Punisher is the one Marvel comic series I can claim having the first issue of.I had reserved optimism, only because I think Travolta, has had some real stinkers of some movies lately, and I was afraid his over-the-top cheese ala Swordfish would ruin the movie.  I had hope because I've felt that even if you didn't like some of the latest Marvel movies, for the most part, they've had the budget and often, they've attempted to stick close to the comic background (yes, everyone loves Lou Ferrigno, but the Comic Hulk was massive in size. I know, the Green Goblin didn't wear a mask like that, but it gave him a modern scary look similar to the original comic, that I'm not sure makeup would have been able to reproduce).I wasn't so sure about Thomas Jane as the Punisher, but he did a fine job. I originally envisioned a more muscular bulk picturing the artwork from the comic book, but really the Character of the Punisher should be a ""navy seal, army ranger"" lean soldier build.  His performance was controlled anger. The movie overall, had just the right balance of sappy love thread, without overtaking the main plot, and that is vengeance, (or punishment).I would say the storyline is pretty close.  It's been awhile since I've revisited some of my old comics, but I remember the Punisher as no-nonsense, wrath of vengeance type of character.They've given this version of Punisher a more thoughtful approach, in that he sets up his enemy for ""punishment"", instead of just tracking them down and killing them.The one-liners were funny enough to get chuckles but not too cheesy.  Some of Arnold Swarzenneger's movies seems to get a groan of displeasure from someone in the audience with his one-liners.I had thought, originally that the movie had made the character a little on the soft side, not that I was craving violence,...ok, just a little bit, but the Punisher is a brutal character.  (OK for the record, the Teenage Mutant Ninja turtles were not cuddly characters, in the comics, they were pretty brutal themselves).I was afraid they had softened him up watching thru most of the middle of the movie, but the finale at the end definately clinched it for me.
And YES, he is wearing the White Skull.  Why they didn't give Dolph Lungren the White Skull is beyond me.  If there is no skull, then it's not the Punisher.  You might as well remove the S off Superman's chest.Thanksfully I can fully put the rest the inferior former Punisher movie, this movie is worthy of the title.",The Punisher
236,Leafsman_69,Ranks Right Up There with X2 in the Comic Book Films Genre,9,5 January 2005,"The Punisher has always been my favorite comic book hero. He is human, dark and abides by the same rules of physics everyone else does. The Punisher is a merciless, colourless but a clever hero which sets him apart from others in the Marvel and DC world. The film ""The Punisher"" captured the character of the Punisher completely. Tom Jane is relatively unknown in the film industry compared to others who have played superheros in the last four years. With that said, he does a fine job, although he is a little on the small side. Jane's performance is convincing to the point where you can almost see his face on the comic book pages as the character himself. Travolta also did a superb job. I'll admit that I did not expect him to attain the role of a villain in such a film because of its comic origins, however the best actors are always willing to try new things. Travolta plays the character of Howard Saint, which is truly despicable until the end where he meets justice.I am also grateful for John Hensleigh's decision to make this a no-holds-barred action movie. All too often action movies, especially comic book ones, are watered down so a younger audience will be drawn to it. The way I see it is if the comic book spares no prisoners then why should the movie? It would have been nice to see a man like the Kingpin as a villain however the movie Daredevil already butchered his character so it was best a fictional bad guy was created. The movie moves at a fast pace and does show a human side to the Punisher, only to have that side disappear in the face of the mob. The Punisher's motives are personal, and he relies on firepower as opposed to superpower to stop his opponents. Although there were no award winning acting sequences, there was also no week links in the acting chain, making it a solid production. If you are a true Punisher fan, you will love this movie, if you are not, then thats unfortunate however I believe you will still find it to be worth your dollar. I also highly recommend the Punisher made in the 1980's with Lundren. It shouldn't be too hard to find. WAY TO GO MARVEL FOR NOT ALLOWING THIS ONE TO BE MESSED UP!!!",The Punisher
237,RolandCPhillips,"Aberration of the comics, but an entertainment",6,28 September 2004,"The chief virtue of this otherwise flaccid and frankly lame film are two pretty great fight scenes that involve Castle mutilating two of the myriad assassins sent to annihilate him. Obviously, said hit men aren't avid Marvel readers.Okay, okay, I know I shouldn't be so scornful, I just feel a bit hard-done by. I've been an avid reader of this psycho vigilante for a while, and quite frankly this film doesn't come close to capturing the central darkness. The rebuke to my disappointment will be that I can't expect to have a character worked on by so many writers to be placed cogently on the screen in all his disturbed glory. But I think I can. Otherwise why bother to make another film about revenge?A number of problems surface early. A (relatively) low budget, relocation to Tampa (thus losing the engrossing urban alienation/Gothic themes), some hoary contrivances (Castle's Dad having an arsenal at hand), Castle's background being very sketchy, off the shelf dialogue, leaden editing and a lack of brutality. Regardless of the much-touted opening massacre and R/18 rating, the film's tame and not particularly graphic. No comic-book nastiness here.Worse, the actors have nothing to work with, and the cast IS pretty decent. It is to the credit of Jane and Travolta that they lend their characters an intensity and confusion not mirrored in the script. Will Patton, as henchman Quentin Glass, makes the greatest impression with a more layered persona. This version also lacks the fetishtic element of the Dolph Lundgren version, though it manages to bypass the camp, and it goes without saying the inherently evil, narcissistic and psychotic nature of The Punisher's actions goes unexplored.But if you're looking for a beer and pizza movie, then this is an okay night out, that almost gets the seductive edge of a tawdry B-movie working for it. Despite dull patches the fights do have a faintly sadistic edge, Conrad W. Hall's cinematography is colourful and understands the need for a comic-book pallet, and there is humour to be found in the albeit condescending presentation of The Punisher's loser neighbors. Plus, the filmmakers leave enough questions hanging to provide material for a sequel, which isn't an unwelcome prospect.Hell, I'll admit it, I enjoyed it.

239,BENARES-2,Punisher Lite: 1/3 the calories of the regular Punisher!,5,17 April 2004,"Angst is not something that ever bothered the Frank Castle of the comics world.  Marvel's recent string of heroes have simply been too angsty. Daredevil?  Angst!  The Punisher?  Angst!  Spiderman?  Ang-- oh, wait, he's supposed to be that way...  But anyhoo, this movie took a great concept and watered it down seriously.  First off, Thomas Jane tried his best, but his severely lacked the menacing nature of the Punisher -- Frank Castle of the comics is an unstoppable meat-grinder when it comes to crooks, but the movie version just makes you want to yawn in comparison.  Travolta's villain was just Travolta doing his usual schtick, and lacked any real threat-factor of any sort.  Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is beautiful and gutsy, but the character from the comic is _neither_ of those things, so she just comes across as cliche.  Spacker Dave and Mr. Bumpo were pretty darn good (though Bumpo must've been on the Subway diet for this film in comparison with his comic counterpart) and the Russian was a spot-on match (despite his lack of dialogue, which was unfortunately a big loss in character) -- the fight sequence between him and Frank is about 80% close to the comic's same scene. Overall, it's an ok film and has some funny parts to it, but doesn't seem like it really earned the R-rating and just seriously... lacks, for lack of a better term.

240,Artist_TRS,"""Good Memories Can Save Your Life""",8,1 February 2020,"It's apparent that 2004's ""The Punisher"" is not a sensible contender for the greatest Marvel-based movie of all time, but despite that, I still enjoy elements of the movie. I enjoy the thrilling action, I enjoy Thomas Jane's compassionate yet brutal portrayal of Frank Castle, I enjoy the endearing rapport of the misfit tenant supporting characters Castle grows connection with, and I enjoy the hauntingly exquisite score by Carlo Siliotto; those elements are for me that come immediate to mind.The movie's narrative mainly adapts elements from my favourite Punisher comic book story-arc: 2000-2001's twelve issue length ""Welcome Back, Frank"". In that story like this movie, Frank Castle is a recluse who inhabits a shabby apartment building, keeping himself hidden from enemy attention. Adjacent tenants named Joan, Bumpo, and Spacker Dave in the series Frank Castle unwillingly gains loyal friendships from; they too are featured in 2004's ""The Punisher"", though with slight characterization changes. I'm really fond of those supporting characters and glad they were incorporated into the movie because they really clarify Frank Castle's compassionate light among the brutal darkness of his heart.As an avid fan and reader of the titular character's comic books, further adaptations of scenarios occur in 2004's ""The Punisher""; it's always gratifying as a fan for me to recognize and feel the homage of a live-action portrayal of what only existed on pages. Two notable examples are the thrilling fight with the Russian from ""Welcome Back, Frank"", and the popsicle torture scene adapted from ""The Punisher: Warzone #1"" (1992).The only glaring downside to 2004's ""The Punisher"", is that the archenemy villain to Frank Castle is generic. Not terrible to break the movie, but generic in comparison to better and more fascinating options of villains the filmmakers could've adapted from the comics; Jigsaw to demonstrate (who was featured in the 2008 reboot).To conclude, 2004's ""The Punisher"" undoubtedly won't win a best Marvel movie war, but has enough ammunition of thrills to go in guns blazing; it's definitely satisfying.",The Punisher
241,JohnnyNoGood,"Critics can cram it, flick for fans",8,18 April 2004,"Surprisingly satisfying. Going into it, I knew it wasn't going to be ""Spider-man"" and after reading a few negative reviews, I expected even less. I was pleasantly surprised at it's whit, over-the-top violence, and accuracy to the comic. With all of the production companies cashing in on comic book heros, this was nosurprise...but you have to remember that The Punisher is a violent and darkhero. I enjoyed how extreme and gruesome the violence was and how thatevens out with the comedic moments. The lighter moments were really light and the darker moments were really dark...plain and simple. The movie had anoriginal auora about it and twist to what some might say a mediocre story. It's western-feel and creative camera work made up for the anti-climactic battlebetween Castle and Saint. It had good pace and the events seemed to have areal presence to them, just like many of the characters. The Punisher isn't just a guy blowing away gangsters, even the gangsters have an original, yet classicfeel to them and are well-rounded...(as far as henchmen go). Frank Castle isn't some radioactive-ridden super hero; he's a man haunted by his past andultimately isn't out for revenge...he's out for punishment.",The Punisher
242,bass-player-blues,Travolta was badly miscast,6,13 July 2021,"I really pains me to write a somewhat negative review of this film because it was a favorite as a teen and one of the coolest movies at the time it came out. Now with over 15 years of hindsight I don't enjoy it nearly as much. Casting Travolta as the main villain is the film's biggest fault. He's just too 'likeable' as a villain in a movie with such dark subject matter where the audience needs to completely despise the main villain. That's why he works so well as a ""likeable villain"" in a movie like Pulp Fiction. It's also a bit hard to take Travolta seriously as the head of a giant criminal empire in Florida lol. The actress that plays his wife Lydia however was perfectly cast but because of her motives you really despise her more than Howard Saint which is problematic to the buildup to the climax. Travolta does his best in the role and there are some notable strong scenes with him such as the ""Bowie knife"" at Quinton's house. Overall he was badly miscast though.Thomas Jane seems like an ideal Punisher on the surface but ultimately he is just too cardboard in his portrayal. As the audience we don't feel his pain enough despite a hilarious giant fan in his apartment which apparently only runs at night in slow motion during his ""drinking sorrow scenes"". For car lovers like me Castle's GTO and the hit man's Roadrunner (which eventually becomes his) are fun to see on screen. I was disappointed however to hear they initially planned a longer chase between these 2 muscle cars. The guitar playing hitman scene is definitely one of the biggest strong points of the film, well acted and well done on most every level. If you haven't seen the film look up just that scene on Youtube!",The Punisher
243,TigerMann,It's like a boring comic book ... movie,5,17 April 2006,"First, let me state that I'm a pretty devoted follower of the Punisher comic, produced by Marvel. His character, having been resurrected from the bowels of one or two-shot guest-star roles in comics such as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""Daredevil"" was given a title all his own, magnificently penned and drawn by Steve Grant and Mike Zeck, respectively. Through the years, the Punisher has experienced a proverbial roller-coaster of ups and downs. In the last five or six years, writer Garth Ennis completely reinvented the Frank Castle/Punisher comic, adding layers of depth (not to mention superb storytelling) to a character that was beginning to wither away inside the Marvel Comic universe. I say all this because it is the Garth Ennis reinterpretation of the Punisher that this film, ""The Punisher"" is primarily reefed upon. Or ... well, sort of.Like any comic book movie that's being produced nowadays, we're shown in this film a detailed (and somewhat graphic) depiction of Frank Castle's (Thomas Jane) metamorphosis into the Punisher. We watch as his entire family is massacred ... we stand by as his depression and grief evolves into bitter hatred. We see him cleverly unravel a well-organized mafia, strand by strand. We hear as he explains his actions ... that he is not exacting vengeance upon those who wronged him ... rather, he is pronouncing grave punishment.I love this character to death. And I think, for the most part, ""The Punisher"" characterizes the strengths of his original comic book design. He's intense, clever ... but far from a superhero. So why, then, is the end result so utterly prosaic in its telling? To Thomas Jane's credit, I think he does his dead-level best at what he's given to work with. For my money, I'm betting it's the indifference of actors like John Travolta, who carries his role as the mafia boss too underhandedly. It's not that I don't like Travolta ... it's just that he doesn't really move me when he's playing a sinister heavy. It's just not in him, I'm afraid. Smaller, independent productions, such as ""White Man's Burden"" suit him rather well. But with each of those, we're also forced to contend with movies like ""Broken Arrow,"" and ""Swordfish,"" where Travolta is seen as some kind of criminal mastermind.As a fan of the Punisher comic, I wasn't at all thrilled with the liberties filmmaker Jonathan Hensleigh took with his origins ... or his setting. From what I've taken away from interviews that I have read, Tampa, Florida was used (instead of New York City) because of budget restrictions. This is hardly fair. Would Sam Raimi have made ""Spider-Man"" if he were forced to film in a city, other than the Big Apple? Of course not. I know that the Punisher character is pretty far removed from Spider-Man in terms of popularity, but come on!! It would be easier if I just summed this film up as, well, boring. Formulaic to the core. I had a lot of fun watching it ... but something much better could have been made, given the correct script and a trifle more creativity behind the camera. Thomas Jane did a bang-up job playing the tortured Punisher ... he's a decent actor who mined some rich, greasy ore from the character. The Punisher isn't really a ""superhero"" at all ... he's a vigilante who fights on the side of good ... but does so by breaking the law. (Anyone interested in the basic physics of his character should scour their nearest flea market for copies of Don Pellington's original pulp series, The Executioner.) You know, I'm looking forward to seeing a sequel ... with a bigger budget, and hopefully in a setting OTHER than Tampa. But we've all seen this action-genre film dozens of times before. There's no escaping that, I'm afraid.By the way ... As a fan-boy, I'd really love to see the Punisher's classic villain, Jigsaw, as a possible character in the sequel. And if Marvel Films cares enough about this franchise, I believe they'd hire Garth Ennis to pen the script. He's given the Punisher a thrilling new life on the page. No reason he couldn't do it all over again, with a palette the size of a Hollywood movie.",The Punisher

245,konya-s,"""This is not vengeance. It's punishment."" More like a joke...Bad joke",5,1 May 2009,"I expected to see a good old fashioned action flick and I disappointed. Very disappointed. This movie is very, very bad! Not the worst movie, but close. Don't get me wrong, Thomas Jane would be perfect for the role. He would be the perfect Punisher. He has the voice for that and the look, but for God's sake, where is the director when a film needed him? Oh yeah, it has a director, called Jonathan Hensleigh. But he didn't do anything for this picture. The dialogs are so incredibly bad, it's painful to hear, and what about those idiotic annoying neighbors? What are they doing here? This is just wrong! So what about the action? Well, the action on the other hand was not so bad. Well, let's just say: good. I liked the scene when Frank's family got killed. It was great and somehow disturbing to me. That was really good. But there is more bad thing in the movie than a good thing. Some scenes are so bad you are laughing about them. John Travolta's character for example. I love Travolta. I never see him giving a bad performance. I saw him in a bad film but never a bad performance. But here...He's awful. Sorry, but that's the truth. He was like ""What the heck am I doing here? Okay, I play the bad guy, so I say something really bad."" He's acted like he didn't give a damn about the whole project. Well, I can understand him. That's the point where the film needs a director. But the director is nowhere. That's bad, isn't it? Most of the actors in this movie are awful so it's not just about Travolta. Meanwhile the Punisher take his bad-ass-suit and do something really...Well, honestly he didn't do anything bad-ass only at the final showdown but that was not enough. He's crying, he's like a grown-up-baby. So the last thing you would think about him is: ""That guy is bad-ass."" No, he's not. He's pretty lame for being a guy who kills every single bad guy in the streets. That's it, that's the sad truth. So how's the final showdown? It was pretty good after that damn car-thing. Jesus...That was the worst main villain-death ever. Really. It was hilarious but not in a good way. Awful I say. Painful to watch but not in a good way. Just bad. So, so bad. It's punishment, all right. For the viewer. Capital Punishment!Avoid this movie! Go, watch War Zone or the Death Wish-movies! Those are awesome but this is crap!",The Punisher

Lame, uninvolving setup. Travolta was embarrassing. ""Sexy"" Laura Harring looked awful.  Thomas Jane looked constipated. Then something happened....an assassin turns up, sings a song to Punisher in a diner.  Then KABLAMMO, movie finds it's groove and the ensuing, and sometimes funny battles ( especially mano a mano with giant Russian ) turn this movie into an enjoyable blast.  Punisher's next door neighbors turn out to be more plucky and clever than I expected, and Punisher's revenge plot trickery, and heavy metal action,  take on an aura of gleeful, over the top, trash movie fun.

247,devinshee,An Old Fashioned Action/Revenge Movie,8,17 December 2007,"I really liked the Punisher movie. I give it a strong 8 out of 10 stars. Its nice that there is a Punisher movie, a real one, although the one with Dolph Lundgren is alright. The Punisher movie is a good old fashioned action and revenge movie. It is kind of like those 70's and 80's action movies, and maybe the 90's action movies I guess. It is a very enjoyable movie. It has some good action scenes, no special effects or anything, it is straightforward. It is a pretty violent movie, some of it is bloody, but not much. Its mostly kind of brutal I think. I like the fight with the Russian, it was almost like James Bond during that scene, and The Punisher being thrown through walls and stuff, the scene where Frank Castles family gets murdered is a good scene, weird that they killed his entire family, cousins, uncles, grandma's. And the ending action scene where The Punisher kills all those guys at the club, and kill's the main bad guy, who is Howard Saint. I think the ending action scene is the best part of the movie. And the movie has a lot of explosions. It was cool how The Punisher had a skull painted on his bullet proof vest and he gets shot a couple times with a shotgun, something new, and it was effective. The movie had some good acting, especially by Thomas Jane. And everyone else was alright, but a few were not so good. I guess some of the comic relief between Frank Castle and the people in the apartment was alright. And its quite a dark movie, with some scenes of torture, but one of the torture scenes is an actual one. When a poor character is getting his piercings pulled out, the screaming was kind of disturbing. I also really like the music in the movie, it is very old fashioned music, it sounds like 50's and 40's music, and I like the theme too, it makes the movie seem very heroic and powerful. That closing scene is great with The Punisher standing on that bridge and narrating a little, it was kind of like the movie Cobra. Maybe some of the movie was a little drawn out with the stuff between Howard Saint and his wife, other than that, everything was good. Its a very enjoyable old fashioned revenge/action movie. It has kind of a fresh feel to it. Im looking forward to the new Punisher movie that's being made, I hope its good, and its a shame Thomas Jane is not The Punisher anymore. The question is, is the new Punisher movie going to be straight to DVD as some people say? Let's see.",The Punisher
248,bwilkus,THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE A DELETED SCENE. AWFUL - 2/10,2,3 October 2004,"I rented this film, as a fan of the Punisher, and as a fan of movies in general, and I must say, (all comic book movie failures aside) this is quite possibly the worst film I have seen in a long time. The story is god awful, predictable and contrived. The dialogue is horrid, and to make it even worse, the acting is fairly pathetic. Tom Jane IS NOT the Punisher, he has neither the look nor the physique. Travola is just plain silly and he is not at all convincing as a villain. But this is really not why this movie sucked so bad. The failure is really in the story and execution of the film. It is cheesy, pointless and obviously a film designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator. The only cool thing about this film was the Pontiac GTO that they quickly destroyed, but this was obviously a huge bite-off of Mad Max, just like his side-by-side sawed-off shotgun, and the way his wife and kid got ran down by the truck. It's OK to be influenced by other movies, but to virtually copy them is just plain pathetic. And by the way, I think that Tampa actually does have a police dept and a fire dept. Its funny how they never seem to show up during any of the action. Anyway, I won't go on for much longer, but I must tell you, the cherry on top of this giant turd, was at the end, when all the cars blow up just right, so that that a flaming Punisher skull can be seen from the skies above. Wow, that was soooooo cooooool.how about no, Scott? In the word's of Eric Cartman, 'WEEK! LAME!' 2/10",The Punisher

The most important thing in this movie is the action, and it's very great. Frank Castle, the protagonist is very well written, you understand perfectly why he wants his revenge and the other supporting characters are very charismatic.
The direction and the cinematography is conventional, but for a 2004 movie it's good. The VFX and choreographies are well done and the OST helps the movie a lot.Very, very underrated. Personally I think it's very good and entertaining!",The Punisher
250,Rayniack,The worst directing i ever seen!,2,2 December 2005,"I remember seeing the original version with Dolph Rundgreen a long time ago and thinking it was a good film. I was excited to see how this new version would be like and had high expectations since this remake even scored better than the original! I was very annoyed from the first seconds of this film. The film was filmed in such dark places that you hardly could not see anything! Yes even when i did put brightness and contrast to full! It was almost night all time or the scenes were in rooms with no windows. Most of the action sceenes you could not see anything until there was an explosion and you could see something for a second! This made it extremely difficult to follow the plot, since you could not know who was in the scenes because of the darkness. Most of times you just saw some shadows. This is the worst directing i ever seen! The plot was a Darkman ripoff. If you have not seen this film, I suggest you stick with the original instead or go for Darkman! This movie is completely destroyed because of awful directing and production!",The Punisher
251,NoFleshShallBeSpared,Yet another great comic book disappointment**1/2,5,5 November 2004,"I swear that these comic book to movie adaptations just have to be like book to movie adaptations. Something is invariably lost in translation.SPOILERS sprinkled liberally throughout................................................In this case, somebody else already put it in a way that I will put it, this movie didn't rely on it's strengths enough. Personally I felt Thomas Jane did do a good acting job as the Punisher, he really did nail the characters disposition down (save for his reaction to Joan, who was written as more emotionally and mentally weak than Rebecca Romjin-Stamos portrayed her, which would've been more appealing to him sexually. As well as his reaction to losing his family, and lack of psychotic berserker ultra-violence that gave this human character an inhuman slant to him.)Which pretty much says that the weakness in this flick is the writing, it's been said that budget conflicts and hack or rush editing did-in this movie. Maybe we needed the soundtrack and movie marketing budgets to be cut back on!And yes, I'll echo another sentiment; the one that states the lack of CGI gave this movie more of a gritty, realistic feel t o it. As well as Frank's use of intellect to bring down his enemies. But, at the same time, the original comic-book Punisher was more of a kill-em'-all-let-God-sort-em'-out type of character (which I'll admit that the 1989 version did better) than he's portrayed here. Believe me, punishment was always quick and decisive, to my knowledge Frank Castle only used sabotage if he couldn't get to his target, which in this movie it seems like he should have no problems killing these people.Another inconsistency was Howard Saint, he's brash and arrogant until the end when he becomes a sniveling pansy (like he was in the comic!) As well as Frank himself, the only reason Dave got tortured in the comic book if I remember correctly was because Frank himself was not around to protect his neighbors, not because he was post-mud-stomped to the point he was strung out ! Like someone else said, he wouldn't have healed right away. And yet, why wasn't all the implied quick-escape, booby-trapped apartment tricks employed? Some were, but I think more in the guise of my favorite comic-book character!Yet, again this was said, we see an actually human Punisher (which was why I liked him), he vulnerable (this movie makes him too vulnerable, in my honest opinion), he cares about people to an extent and he's also charitable. Another thing was using something of an original background story that fudged over the original, which would've been more impressive than just a re-fleshing of Welcome Back, Frank when the Punisher was down and out in financing and resources. Overall, this movie gets cool points for using Hank Thornton (even though Frank would've shot him right away), showing Frank's inner-demons (not well enough though) and keeping the original tone and grit of the comic book (albeit the superficial aspects of The Punisher.)However, everything else sucked. **1/2",The Punisher
252,clgarglez,Sucks,2,13 March 2007,"My only hope for this movie was Travolta playing a villain as I remember in Sword fish or face off, but not even him can save this from being a senseless absurd movie with nothing worth seeing or remembering.The supporting characters have nothing likable, so whether they live or die is unremarkable. Just a bunch of junkies that for no reason rally to support him even enduring torture.Though his motives are strong they kind of fade in the movie, and the skull scene is just to to show off. The bottom line is that his id got angry and just trashes everything to calm down Avoid it is possible.",The Punisher
253,enemyzero,Dead on,8,30 October 2005,"I would like to start off by saying I own every issue of the original ""The Punisher"" ""The Punisher: War Journal"", and ""The Punisher: War Zone"" and have been a HUGE Punisher fan since about 1987. I was a little worried going into this after Dolph Lundgren's disgrace in 1989, combined with the fact that this movie got almost no hype in my area and I had to drive an hour away to see it, I planned for the worst.I won't lie, I went in full costume because I am a huge fan, so I am more than a little biased about the Punisher and would accept nothing less than amazing. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. Yes, it started a little slow taking a while to get off the ground, but once he dawned the skull and went on his mission, my adrenaline was pumping.One of my major concerns was the casting of Thomas Jane as Frank Castle, but after seeing the film, I wouldn't want anyone else. I thought the choice of not using an ""action star"" such as The Rock was the right decision. Just look at the steaming pile of crap that came out in '89. (I know I mentioned it twice now, but that movie was really bad) Another delightful surprise was the casting of John Travolta. I never expected this. Though ""Saint"" was an original Punisher villain, he was still a pretty cool character, and I doubt anyone other than die hard Punisher fans would know who Jig Saw, The Medallion, and Bushwacker are, although I did love the use of the Russian as one of the hit men.A lot of people didn't dig this film because The Punisher isn't as lovable as Spiderman, and has no super powers, plus it was a much darker film than other comic films, and it stuck more to the character of the comic books.",The Punisher
254,Famas_GunSlinger,Not nearly enough punishing.,5,6 March 2019,"I watched this movie in theaters when it premiered and decided to give it another go on Blu ray.While his origin story still holds up and the path to him becoming the Punisher is well done and entertaining, once he's become him the movie doesn't really know where to go.There's a lot of meandering and the ancillary characters are incredibly uninteresting. Probably the most amusing part of the story is how closely it mimics Shakespeare's Othello in terms of one of it's subplots.The movie seems more concerned with showing off Mr. Jane's ripped physique than anything else. His training is impressive, but having him shirtless in every other scene gets a little ridiculous.Another gripe is just how little action the movie has. He really doesn't get much time to punish people and most of the action scenes are very short, forgettable, and completely toothless. Furthermore, he's barely in his costume in the movie.So in sum, really great stuff up until he turns into the titular character, and the rest is pretty mediocre.",The Punisher

It was one of the lamest movies I've ever seen. It's like it was made to be lame. So many flaws are shown in the movie. I'm pretty sure the director must've meant to put the flaws and lameness in the movie; I don't know why though. Maybe he wanted to put a comical sense into it. But seriously, don't watch this movie because you're gonna waste your time and money like I did; unless you don't believe me that there are still people who try to make a movie this lame.

The first time I heard of him was when he made an appearance in the Spider-man cartoon a while back and then I happened across one of the cable channels and saw the film with Dolf Lungren as The Punisher now that was also a really good film, but this one was the best. I loved the whole beginning when they told us what happened to him to make him The Punisher. Me as a film maker thought it was necessary to bring his pain and anger to the screen. That was lacking in the Dolf Lungren version and the only thing I didn't like about it.  You don't have to be a fan of the comic book to get a kick out of this film.

257,The-Mighty-Vindicator,Could have been much better,7,5 July 2008,"Why was this Marvel comic character given such a measly budget?? Don't they like the idea of a 'normal' guy becoming a vigilante? Does one have to have 'super-powers' to get the big buck budgets? Very sad.With that said, this version of the Punisher was a bit better than Dolph Lundgren's version - with the glaring fault of making this Punisher an 'antiChrist'. What I mean by that, is that this Punisher is wished well by a 'preacher/prophet' type man: 'God go with you.' and this Punisher says God's going to sit this one out! Dolph's Punisher has him praying to God - questioning, answering his prayer with insight. Sad reversal in my mind and heart.This movie just doesn't have the right 'feel' to it, that one might get from the comic - their favorite story line or such. Not much detail on his weapons either - another missing part that could have been added without problem. Lack of attention to details.One good thing about this movie though, was the add-in of the homosexual villain. No spoilers though here.

258,Killa_Cam,Nice Comedy!,4,22 July 2004,"No, no there's no mistake in the title of my review, mind you! Yet, there's clearly a mistake in this movie's genre definition. Cause, yes, it IS a freaking comedy! Maybe if it was originally marketed as a comedy or a parody on Marvel's The Punisher, I'd be more soft & rate it 5 or even 6, cause the jokes were really funny sometimes. But, guys, seriously, this is not a gangster action or a thriller! Too bad...Direction & production of the movie is inexplicable. The director & the writers totally misconceived the general idea of The Punisher. It is a story of a man, who has nothing to lose, who thinks he's above the law, that he is the law. He knows no compassion & no love, his verdict is the ultimate truth. He also has flashbacks of his family as well as he sees the faces of the people he killed in the nightmares. This movie should've been extremely violent, ruthless to the point. It should have been a film noire with very dark atmosphere. What we get is a cheesy comedy action. Seriously R rated? I'd rate it PG-13 if not for the nudity! The movie features too much unnecessary humour (funny, but this is not what we expected!) & the fighting scenes also look ludicrous!The acting is almost mediocre at best. Thomas Jane doesn't feel or understand his character. Making a tough face & staring somewhere far away is not enough to play Frank Castle. John Travolta & Laura Harring make excellent villains, too bad the story is so bad it couldn't provide this talented duo with decent creative outlet. As for the other actors, their names ain't even worth mentioning.The punishment for us viewers was too severe. Watching two hours of comic action scenes is not what we expected.

It's a reminder of what a action movie used to be, simple set up, rugged badly acted hero, super villain with a dozen henchmen and guns, lots of guns! Tom Jane clearly isn't the greatest actor going but he stares and grunts in a way that says ""o.k, we're rooting for you."" John Travolta gets his best part in a long while, granted its very 'swordfish' but every time he's on screen things get interesting and the always good Will Patton earns his money as the homosexual bad guy side kick. The film may have had a tight budget but it doesn't really show in some great set pieces including the clever punisher final exploding shot and this one man army gets ready for action in a nice little commando rip off, all he's lacking is a multiple missile launcher. The movie may have tanked badly at the box office, hey it barely registered here in england (i brought the DVD), but then hey ain't spiderman and he's not fun for the whole family, but if you want some nice old school fists, guns & knives pick this movie up on DVD, crack open a couple of brews, turn your brain off and enjoy 'Commando' for the 21st century!

260,without_eyelids,A game effort but not good enough...,6,24 December 2004,"When it comes to the Punisher, you don't need too many of the comics to know what he's all about. His family died, he got revenge, but found that wasn't enough. Mack Boland had a similar story (Who was the inspiration, to use the word lightly, for Punisher), as do the Boondock Saints, the Crow, Wyatt Earp, etc. so on and so forth. Over some 30-odd years Punisher killed a lot of dudes, went to prison a couple times, appeared in a few ""what-ifs"", met the merrier side of Marvel (Spidey, Daredevil, with mixed results), and even became a servant of the Lord (Don't ask). Garth Ennis wrote a miniseries called ""Welcome Back, Frank"" which started the resurgence of interest in the Punisher after a few disastrous detours from the simple and successful vigilante formula that keeps fans coming back to Punisher.When you need to make a successful movie about the Punisher, you need to preserve the general conceit of the Punisher ethos. 1) He's insane. Anyone who kills for both a hobby and a living is crazy. 2) He's only redeemed by the fact that the people he kills are worse than he is. MUCH worse. 3) Since he's insane and cannot possibly coexist with society in a sane world, it's nice to have some humor about the whole situation, just to keep some perspective on the issue and with luck, some major distance from any real-life ""what-ifs"".It's strange to me that a relative unknown (Thomas Jane) got the title role while a very known guy (John Travolta) got the villain. This, if anything, hurt the film. John Travolta is a capable actor in many of his films but a film like the Punisher requires the bad guy to be SO bad that the people have to admit that wow, he really needs to die. John Travolta was more evil in Broken Arrow and Face/Off. The Crow had villains that really deserving of death. ""The Punisher"" fails. The moment of satisfying righteous vengeance is marred by the fact that, well... Thomas Saint's (Travolta) son DID die. What did you expect the reaction from a powerful criminal would be? To top it off, most of Thomas Saint's operations are not shown to be bloodthirsty and brutal... he doesn't usually murder, smuggle, dabble in child pornography, or anything that would be universally regarded as really, really bullet-in-the-head -bad-.The Punisher is a failed opportunity. Most of the plot plods along with direct references to ""Welcome Back, Frank"", ""Warzone #1"", ""Punisher: War Journal"", which serve to bore rather than pay homage. It's a Garth Ennis Punisher without the humor and dialogue, War Journal without Frank's psychotic narration, and War Zone without the mafia. Characters either have too much depth or not enough. In the end, what would really be just a bad, bad film gets a better vote from me only because it tried to stay true to its source material, which a mixed blessing for Punisher though it may not be for other comics (Spiderman, Daredevil). Fanboys tend not to stick with Punisher very long.Note to producers: next time, try something different.",The Punisher
261,HighlanderArg,Different from Dolph's,6,10 February 2005,"In 1989, the first movie adaptation for ""The Punisher"" was made. Featuring the by then popular (now a good straight-to-video actor) Dolph Lundgren (""Rocky IV"", ""Masters of the Universe""). 15 years later, a second, non-sequel, adaptation was made.This time, Frank Castle is played by Thomas Jane (""Deep blue Sea""). While the first film had Castle already on a vengeance rampage, with just a glimpse of the death of his family, this one shows us how his wife (played by Samantha Mathis) and kid are killed. Believed to be dead, Castle makes his return to make a living hell out of the life of the man responsible.Apart from the aforementioned, the film features people like John Travolta, Will Patton, Roy Scheider, and the always beautiful Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. The plot is different, slightly more complex than the other, yet I can't say it's better or worse than Dolph's. Though violent, it has some comic moments.In short, it's not Mel Gibson's ""Payback"", and lacks the gore of a ""Kill Bill"" (though it's better than the latter), so watch it. You won't be disappointed.6/10",The Punisher
262,tandrei2001,A true action movie,7,13 April 2014,"A movie that stands out in its category: Marvel sequels. The movie has it all: cool main character, funny and sympathetic side characters (Dave and the fat guy), cool action scenes (oh... those were the times where CGI was not yet the cost saving solution for everything) and also cool bad guys, starting with Travolta himself. Although you know what's gonna happen from the start, you don't guess it how! There are also some ""tarantinesque"" scenes, like the one in which Frank enters the bank and spreads the money on the window, or the ending fighting scene, which only get's it better. The main character is likable by its short talking and dark mood. There is also an undefined erotic tension between Frank and Joan adding some spice to it. Overall an entertaining movie, at least you know what you get!",The Punisher
263,mikemapa,What a waste of time,2,3 January 2005,"This movie is such a weak adaptation of a comic book. It should be a story of a vigilante packing every weapon known to man and itching to use them to get his revenge. So one would expect an action-packed movie full of scenes where the hero creatively dispatches (read: blows away) his foes with extreme firepower. But I've seen more action in a typical game of Counter-Strike.The supporting characters are just nonsensical. The Punisher's three neighbors are supposed to be funny and touching, but they turn out neither. John Travolta tries to do his best, but his performance is overblown for the role.If you want the kind of action you'd expect from the Punisher comics, go watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse, or any of the Blade Movies. They dish up action in generous portions and with gusto.",The Punisher
264,Myssi from McF,Why am I been punished?,4,12 July 2004,"It has been many years since the `legendary' Dolph Lungren made the first Punisher. I think that this new Punisher is only made because comic movies are so popular right now. Once again I was skeptical about the movie, after all, the first one was good in its own way :P so would this be just another unnecessary movie? Well, I saw the teaser and it promised a dark mooted, action pack with attitude so I was willing to give it a try. I shouldn't have.Movie started okay; with an action scene. Marks were showing that this could be a good action movie. It even amazed me to see so violent scenes in this kind of modern day Hollywood movie. Of course movie's violent didn't stand a change to the famous (there can be only one) `Dutch touch' of Paul Verhoeven but nice try anyway. What it comes to the actors Thomas Jane was OK as The Punisher but John Travolta wasn't' anything special, he was almost bad. But it was the idiot neighbor sidekicks that were the main reason to make the movie bad. I know that they are in the comic but it surely shows that the director hasn't realized what these characters stands in the comic. He just saw an opportunity to make film funnier in a very stupid way...WHY??? After the first 20 minutes or so when The Punisher enters his new home it really sees how Director just loose the grip of the movie and just starts to wonder what to do next. Drama and comedy are mixed and the result is confusing. You don't know what should be funny and what should be more dramatic. Actually only funny parts are the couple of cool death brought by the punisher and the parts which should be funny are just giving you traumatic feelings. Plot introduces couple of interesting and essential characters who could be crucial to the movie but forgets them totally later on. What's with this?Enjoyed dark mood of the film is gone after first 30 minutes and the Punisher turns out to be just another typical Hollywood action movie without anything good to say about it. Between the action scenes movie is very boring and unnecessary. Action scenes aren't anything special either and those stupid sidekicks are just killing you. The end of the movie kind a like promises a sequel but I hope that the makers realizes soon enough to cut the wings of this turkey before it makes more damage. I suggest you find the Mr. Lungrens version of the movie and just forget about this one.",The Punisher

We had already seen the 1989 Dolph Lundgren version and thought it was a big piece of crap! Thomas Jane played Frank Castle the way The Punisher should be, skull logo on his outfit and everything! Not to mention a tougher-than-tough one-man revenge team out to avenge the death of his entire family, armed with so many weapons even Rambo would look like a wuss in the jungle! John Travolta was cold-hearted as Howard Saint. Very cold-hearted! You'd think he was acting like someone had killed all the Sweathogs in a massacre, he was so mean-looking. Yet I praised his performance, too! Of course, what really makes me and my friends laugh today was what my fiancée said about Thomas Jane the moment she saw him as The Punisher that he had abs, all I had was flabs. And every time she sees this movie (she has it on DVD), my fiancée just adores Thomas Jane beyond my belief! You know, it's a darn shame Thomas Jane won't be in ""Punisher 2"". Instead Ray Stevenson will be in the movie. I really was looking forward to Thomas Jane playing The Punisher again! Anyway, terrific Marvel movie. Should Not Be Missed Nor Bashed!",The Punisher
266,ferry_rudolph,Punisher kicks ass!,8,21 January 2005,"Just saw this movie on DVD and loved it.From the menu screen (with dark and moody music) until the end, it is clear that this is no regular super-hero movie. And that is for good reason as The Punisher is no regular hero.So this movie has none of that romance crap that plagued the Spider-Man movies. No this movie is just action although not non-stop. The story is quite cool too.It is based somewhat on the Welcome Back Frank comic mini-series written by Garth Ennis. But the parts they did took out are not all that great. Joan is portrayed nicely but Mr Bumpo is not big enough and Dave does not have enough piercings.I was also disappointed by The Russian, he did kick Frank's ass but he was also killed relatively easy. True in the comic Frank also got him quite fast when he learned that The Russian dislikes fire (threw a pizza in his face, tripped him and then threw Mr Bumpo on top of him to make him suffocate.I also missed a real car chase but that was about it. I had hoped Frank would kill Liv himself but it was actually way cooler what he actually did.In all, a really good action flick that is not too predictable. And it has a healthy dose of black humor. I love this movie and cannot wait for The Punisher 2!",The Punisher
267,pm_alan,Revenge films....mmmmm,9,9 July 2011,"Not only am I a long time fan of the Punisher, I am also a die-hard fan of revenge movies. This one ranks up there with any of em'. The story-line clings and grips you until the end. The key to success when making a movie based on revenge is making the audience genuinely HATE the antagonist, and this movie delivers. This movie gets emotions going, and that's what a movie should do. Thomas Jane delivers, as well as Travolta. It's really too bad they couldn't have come up with some kind of sequel to this movie also casting Thomas Jane(i'm sure they still could I guess). All in all I couldn't give it a 10, because this movie isn't PERFECT, but it comes damn close.",The Punisher
268,Cat-Squire,"""Do I like it? I love it!""",8,29 January 2005,"""Do I like it? I love it!"" - Frank Castle. That quote from 'The Punisher' sums up my feelings towards this movie. It is by no means the greatest comic book to movie cross over but it is thoroughly enjoyable and filled with action - mainly shooting and explosions.When Howard Saint's son is killed when the FBI turn up to stop the illegal sale of weapons he takes his revenge by having Frank Castle and his whole family killed while they are in Puerto Rico having a family reunion - only Frank does not die. Now he wears a t-shirt his son gave him on his last day alive which has a logo on it which is supposed to keep evil away. This logo is now the logo for The Punisher.The story and acting are both very good, as is the action. Tom Jane (Frank Castle) plays his part excellently and John Travolta (Howard Saint) is smooth as ever. A lot of the characters are very plain, very one sided, but then again, the main focus is on Frank Castle and the other characters don't need to be developed for this film to work.It is a good film to sit back, relax and watch start to finish. If you fancy a good action flick this is definitely a film for you. 'The Punisher' gets an 8/10 from me. A good film and worth a watch.Cat §quire",The Punisher

I was actually in the middle, I thought this film was a well acted and directed affair with Jane been fantastic in the punisher role. The movie is dark and can cause a few upsets but what I find breathtaking about the movie are some of the quotes (I wont spoil them for you, take a watch for yourself) they are quite inspiring, we all lose things and all get upset and to us that thing is a big deal at the time, however other people are always worse off and the film shows sometime we forget that.

Thomas Jane was amazing, he definitely had the essence of the tortured Frank Castle down perfect. The acting in this movie was extremely well done, a lot more well done than many people (critics) have given it credit for. I think that John Travolta even though he can be a bit annoying at times played a great bad guy, and his character was sinister, and cruel, but loving at the same time. Will Patton I think almost stole the show with his portrayal of his character Quentin Glass, because he had a charisma about him that was equally disturbing. It was a great movie, not just 'great for what it was'. The story was good, the stunts, and the violence amazing, and I really hope they greenlight for a sequel.",The Punisher
271,amnesiac12001,Travesty in Translation,1,26 February 2005,"The problem with comic book movies has always been maintaining the balance between the original source material with its bountiful detail and the simplicity of an introductory film.The Punisher is a simple story: Vietnam veteran Frank Castle witnesses the unintentional murder of his family by mafiosos and dedicates his life to destroying criminals. Emphasis on destroy.The Punisher was a product of 1970s nihilism and is probably the only Marvel character to actually kill his opponents. In this day and age, this sensibility is more than a little foreign and in the translation of the book to film it shows.The script is based VERY loosely on Garth Ennis' brilliant Welcome Back Frank series and the origin story. Part of the problem is that the story of WBF deals with a Frank Castle who has 20+ years of slaughter under his belt and goes back to his old ways after a brief character shift in the Marvel universe (complicated and unnecessary to reveal here), and his reputation adds to his presence. In the film, Frank has just picked up the mantle of vengeance-seeker and is extremely clumsy in his work. Secondly, WBF was written by Garth Ennis, a writer whose knack for grotesquerie exceeds the confines of even an NC-17 rated movie, so selecting his story as a basis for a script is ludicrous because his incredibly gory humor can't translate very well to mainstream audiences; and without that, the story loses it's punch AND its lifeforce.The only semblance of this exists in a fight between The Punisher and The Russian, a prominent character whose size and idiocy is a neverending source of comic relief in the book; unfortunately, he is a minor and disposable character here who does manage to create humor through various double-take inducing feats of strength, but nowhere near to the level he should.Frank Castle himself is unrecognizable. The Punisher from the Marvel world is a battle-tested maniac who borders on insanity and uses lethal force in MacGyverian fashion. Thomas Jane plays him as a brooding rogue cop who clearly possesses too little ingenuity to be dangerous and too much humanity to be menacing. In the film version, Castle uses sleight of hand to subdue a knife-wielding abusive boyfriend when the comic-book Castle would have shoved his face through the back of his skull. The rest of the characters are mere shadows of their comic book selves, and many of them, including Saint and Quentin, don't even exist in the book! In short, the film is an appalling collection of action movie clichés, action movie production values, and action movie coincidences to further the plot that they may as well have not even bothered to adapt an actual source material. The pitch-black humor and perversity found in Ennis' story have been stripped away to create a Frank Castle that won't offend too many mainstream moviegoers by being too brutal, a character trait that, let's face it, is the primary reason people liked The Punisher in the first place.Not worth the price of admission.",The Punisher

'The Incredible Hulk' was awful, 'Batman' became a fiasco that still hasn't fully recovered thoroughly, and 'The Fantastic Four' was just not good (though in all fairness Jessica Alba is really hot); but I'm gonna' say it, oh yea - Dolph Lundgren's Punisher was better! But...better in the same way that Bruce Willis summed it up in 'The Last Boy Scout': is it better to get hit in the stomach or the head? At least Dolph emoted anger, confusion and chaos. Hell, this Punisher's address is listed on switchboard.com; drop on by and have a drink! And then I see they're making a part 2 to this garbage! Then add to Bruce's quote, or hit in the nads.

273,ralf_nader,"Good movie, full of beatdowns",7,12 December 2007,"This movie was better than I expected it to be. I had a good idea of what the movie would be about before I saw it based on the brief synopsis on the back of the DVD case. The title clued me in as well.Here's the breakdown: Plot: B+, I had a general idea of what was going to happen before I was even 15 minutes into the movie. I mean, it's The Punisher. What do you think he's going to do? Sit around at home and watch TV? Having said that, predicting the general plot does not ruin it. There are plenty of unexpected parts, and intricate details that really put the gold trim on here. The cleverness of the hero certainly made it more interesting. With all this in consideration, there is still some room for improvement (it's not perfect).Acting: A-, Exceptional. The acting in this movie is very good. I'm not even just talking about the Tom Jane and John Travolta. Many of the supporting actors were decent. To put it another way, when I watched the performance, I didn't get that feeling that the cast worked part time as actors and part time as fast food workers (many horror movies I've seen seemed to have this situation). The only actors I would say kinda sucked in this movie were maybe one or two of the kids living in the apartment (not Rebecca Romijn), but hey, no biggie.Character development: A-, You get attached to the characters easily, the hero especially. The personality of the characters is conveyed to you well and with ease. I would say the good acting made this possible.Special effects: A, Plenty of shooting, explosions, and your other usual action movie effects. All were done well.*BEST aspect of the movie: Parts of the movie give you that feeling you get when you see swift justice dealt out against evil. Lots of beatdowns!*WORST aspect of the movie: If you are looking for absolute realism in this movie, you may have some disappointment. Some parts in the movie seem to fall together too easily. And whenever something explodes or there's a battle going on, why are there never any onlookers or cops around? I guess random gunfire and massive explosions are too commonplace these days. Of course, it's a movie based on a comic book, so people looking for absolute realism shouldn't be looking here anyway.*OVERALL it's a very good movie. If you're really not into bad guys vs hero type movies, then perhaps you'll want to avoid this one, but even then this one is not your conventional hero vs bad guy movie. I would recommend it. I gave it a 7 and not higher because I just think that there could have been some other things in the movie that could have really made it unbelievably good. I'm not sure what those things are (I'm not a movie writer), but I think a 7 is an accurate rating.",The Punisher
274,soniagoenaga25,A much better film than the first version,10,12 June 2004,"I have read lots of commentaries about 'The punisher' so I am going to say few words about it. In the first place I expected this film to be like the version made in 1989, but to my surprise I found it much better and more interesting than the first version. From the beginning to the end it caught my attention, specially because the story itself is attractive. It does not have something unreal, a man whose family is killed by a criminal and who wants revenge is totally real and understandable so in my opinion is not a fiction movie full of fantasy. On the other hand this movie reflects very well the world plenty of violence in which we live, crimes, drug dealers, etc, etc and the lack of justice so I do not understand those people who criticize this film because of the violence shown in it. Life is much more violent and nobody says nothing, just to watch the news and we can see how violent the world is. Apart from the story, the performance of Thomas Jane and John Travolta are very good and although some people could think that Thomas Jane is not very expressive here I have to say that his character can't express his feelings because his only motive is to take revenge on those who attacked his family. For me Thomas is fantastic as the punisher. John Travolta plays his role quite well and gives him a little bit of sense of humour, something necessary. Both are the best actors in this movie. In conclusion, it is a very worth watching film and not so violent as some people could think.",The Punisher

The action isn't even that good either. At the beginning, I hoped that the cheese factor was only in the family scenes (assuming that the writer was an action-movie writer and was still weak on the emotional scenes), but it continued on. Travolta was like a stone wall throughout the entire movie and decided to act only towards the end (and even then I cringed to watch). Please do not see this movie! I turned to my friends 3/4 through and asked if they wanted to leave. Believe me, the best part of this movie are the trailers.

I thought of John Travolta like how he was in Battlefield Earth and just passed it by. I ended up watching it many years later because i heard Thomas Jane was actually the lead (never looked it up). I can see why people might have been discouraged when it came out, the scenes in a lot of parts looked like they were shot with a soap opera daytime camera. The acting by the girl in the apartment especially when she was crying (played by Rebecca Romijn) was beyond horribly embarrassing to say the least in her acting ability. I loved the fact that John Pinette received a role in the film, but i have no idea why he was even in the film as he didn't really do anything? The main bad guys were OK, the Russian fight scene was pretty damn good though. I liked that the Punisher was shown as a regular guy with abilities that only suited his training just using them to the extreme. Thomas Jane did a great job with the role and surprisingly John Travolta did as well, he wasn't the biggest bad guy on the block but he was a regular boss type with no special abilities other than having a lot of henchmen. Some characters should have never been on screen, some were alright.

I hope he breaks through with this one.Travolta should be taken out and shot.I have to write more, so I will.  The set up of the family was a little long, but it did make the violence and murder of the family REALLY palpable.  Even though this was a comic book movie, I had an emotional attachment to the family, which added more realism to the violence than many realistic violent movies.I also keep wondering if Hollywood will ever have a position that is basically ""Story Editor in charge of reducing STUPIDITY."" 
In this movie, there was a little too much of it.  Would it have been so hard to give some explanation of why the hero survices a point-blank bullet to the chest and several other bullets by six man execution squad.  Why didn't any of the killers in the last scene stop pumping bullet after bullet into Jane's kevlar vest and shot for his exposed face?

Well, New Punisher is obviously a better movie, however, I do feel that Old Punisher captured the spirit of the comic better, as well as the psychotic - sociopathic personality that was Frank Castle.  It was more dark and gritty.  Plus, Dolph just really looked the part.New Punisher had too much daylight and pseudo-alcoholic-brooding from Jane, who is a great actor.  I really hope that if there is a Punisher 2 (and there probably will be if other non-hits get sequels, like Resident Evil and Underworld), it improves it the way X2 was a huge improvement over X-Men.I guess the main problem with New Punisher is that it's an origin story, where as Old Punisher was just kicking butt like a pro.  And I really don't like the fact that New Punisher just revealed himself to the public.

Anyone who goes to see this movie for anything other than seeing the title character kick ass shouldn't be in the theater anyway.  Most others will probably like what they see.Hensleigh's directorial style is very bare bones and it works very well. Unlike most action films of this era, there is no CGI and no flashy camera work, these are replaced by real stunt work, simplistic but hard hitting action, and plenty of gigantic explosions.  In this respect it is very much like the Lethal Weapon and Die Hard series'.Another plus is the casting and the acting, which help overcome several cheesy moments that pop up along the way.  Jane is perfect as Frank Castle, Travolta great as Howard Saint.From start to finish, this is a very dark but moves along at a fast pace and entertains.  This movie is not for the squeamish, do not see it if you are sensitive to onscreen violence and brutality.

It's over an hour of melodramatic character development to lead to one action scene that remotely resembles the Punisher that we know and love.Spoilers....There aren't just a few problems in this movie, the whole movie is the problem, if they had kept the storyline and the true character of the Punisher then it would have been over in about a half hour. The punisher doesn't go to the trouble of making the bad guys kill each other and waiting for the evil henchmen to find him at his apartment, he goes in in his armored van ( which is not in the movie) with the help of his technical genius sidekick (also not in the movie) and slaughters the criminals. As for considering suicide at the end? The writers should shoot THEMSELVES for considering putting that in, the Frank Castle we know is too busy making sure the stuff that happened to him doesn't happen to anyone else to bother thinking about ending his own life.So far we have maybe two or three good comic book character movies out of I've lost count how many.

Will Patton's character, Quentin Glass, is introduced as being ""a sadist"" and they point this out by showing him kissing his boyfriend. That's the only touch of homosexuality you see in the whole movie. His being gay is the reason why he is so mean, so immoral.I'm not saying that it should be remade as a gay love story, but that they could have explained Quentin being bad in a different way. The director did not have to make being gay the same as being sadistic killer.Women weren't made to look much better. Just accessories to be used by the men for whatever they wanted. Frank's wife was the best, trying to protect and save their son which failed obviously. I thought the love interest hint with Rebecca Romijn-Stamos was a silly waste of time.Where were the cops? Where were Frank's friends? That bugged me too. Frank was allowed to do all this ""punishing"" and not one cop ever showed up, his friends never tried to stop him? That didn't make sense to me either.And that's my 50 cents.",The Punisher
284,nova1636,"people, stop listening to critics",8,17 April 2004,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD, SORTA* Granted, this was no intellectual or highly-sylized (if that isn't a word, then I improvised, and all of the publishing rights should be in my name) movie, not compared to a Tarentino flick. But here's the thing that impressed me: this is THE VERY FIRST MOVIE that Hensleigh has ever directed, and it is held on the shoulders of a complete unknown (unless, like me, you have been steadily watching Thomas Jane's career ever since Boogie Nights). And it seriously holds its own in the face of such STEEP competition. I disagree with the critics (what the hel1 else is new?) on this one: I think that Jane's acting was NOT wooden or sophmoric. I think that it was actually very good, considering the fact that he portrayed emotion and thought with so few spoken lines. In the scene with the Russian, for example, absolutely ZERO dialogue took place, and yet you knew what the guy was thinking (as in ""OH $HIT""). Other complaints deal with the violence and ""sadism"" of the movie, but, as sick as it sounds, I was RELIEVED: I guess I'm just bored with comic book movies like Hulk and Spiderman that are made more for younger teens than for adults, and the rated R grit of this was refreshing for me. But as far as the critics are concerned, I'd say this makes strike #2 for this year (preceded most notably by their disgust for box-office phenomenon, THE PASSION), because in spite of all the ""this movie's too dark"" this (the punisher is SUPPOSED to be dark) and ""this movie's for testosterone-fiending idiots"" that (okay, it IS an action movie), the audience that I saw the movie with--a vast array of teenagers, adults, and five elderly women who sat behind me (one of which very-justifiably muttered ""MM-MM-MM"" in one of several luscious moments when Tom Jane makes his way to the door sans t-shirt)--absolutely LOVED it, as can only be assumed by all the shouts, laughter, ""OH""s and applause. So THERE, Ebert. Further proof that critics CANNOT speak for the people. I recommend it. P.S.: another high point was a sneak peek at Tom Jane's follow-up movie coming out in June, highly-acclaimed Sundance movie, STANDER, which will have wide-release soon while the Punisher is still fresh in people's minds and Jane is more recognized. I, for one, haven't seen it, but according to several people who have, Jane gives an ""Oscar-worthy"" performance as South African cop-turned-thief. So to all the critics who have already said the man can't act because of the Punisher: I'd say in a month or two you'll be caught with your foot in your mouth. AND MY RANT IS OVER.",The Punisher
285,Chris_BS1212,Surely Frank Castle isn't the hardest character to get right,4,24 April 2010,"I'd never expect a film about the punisher to be that good but still this effort was a little disappointing. Probably because director Jonathan Hensleigh is close to getting a lot right. I feel that the first film in any comic book adaptation is weighed down by having to cover the main character's origin. This is something that I think Spider-Man executes poorly, where the audience is meant to see Peter Parker as your typical shy teenager, instead he comes across as quite pathetic. But The Punisher covers Castle's origin quite well, indeed this is vital given the relentless violent set pieces that are to follow in the second act, not dwelling on it too long but giving the audience a good idea of who Frank Castle is. Thomas Jane is convincing as the FBI agent who wants to start becoming a family man, he plans to move along with his wife and son to London to begin a new chapter in his life.However inevitably something must go wrong as anyone who knows anything about The Punisher surely knows. His final operation with the FBI leads to the death of Bobby Saint, who happens to be the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta) a financier for some prominent Cuban gangsters. Travolta hardly stretches himself here, he does enough to convince as Saint but little more. Upon hearing of his son's death Saint orders that Castle be killed, however in an interesting development his wife Livia (Laura Harring) demands that Castle's whole family be killed. In a rare moment of originality Harring gives us a woman who is as sinister as her villainous husband.From here on events play out more or less as you'd expect with Castle turning to drink and vengeance, or as he puts it punishment, to survive. This results in a many action sequences in which Castle kills his way through Saint's organisation. The action is pretty well done with Castle making interesting use of a bow as a silent weapon and to his credit Hensleigh does not contrive a scenario where Castle uses the grenade launcher we see him prepare just because it's there as directors of these kind of action movies tend to do.If this was all that there was to The Punisher then I think it would have been a better film for it, a reasonable story, some good action, and good lead performance from Thomas Jane would have resulted in an entertaining enough action/revenge film, which is what I was expecting. However there are many elements that are handled poorly and bring this film down in my estimation. Firstly where Castle lives, obviously suspension of belief is integral for films like this but surely the sounds of him torturing someone is his apartment would have lead to a police response eventually. But this is only minor issue compared to three characters who seem really out of place even though I remember them from the comic book and there they worked really well. For a film that is so dark and brooding as The Punisher there is no place for the bad humour and light hearted good nature of a character such as Bumpo. He is so out of place in this film and his friend Dave isn't far behind. Why the latter would not give up Castle's location under torture is a total mystery to me. Not quite so bad is the Russian, a huge, mute monster who shares quite a good fight scene with Castle. It might have been better if I hadn't been distracted by his ridiculous blonde hair and stripy top. Laughable does not even begin to describe his appearance.Fortunately the existence of these characters is made more bearable by Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), Castle's third neighbour, who helps make Castle's character a bit more sympathetic at times when he's just killing generic mobsters and drinking bottles of whiskey. Romijn-Stamos' performance is up there with Jane's as the best in this film and she brings out some of the little humanity that is left in Castle.I did not expect much from this film, but was still disappointed, which is a shame as I could constantly point out how different parts could have been handled better and more effectively, in the end only one for the fans to see.",The Punisher
286,sweet_cuppin_cakes,Beautifully brutal film which somehow manages to have heart. (Some spoilers),9,2 June 2004,"It's been a while since I've walked out of a movie theater as satisfied as I was when I saw The Punisher. I got exactly what I wanted and expected, and I wasn't simply asking for a popcorn flick loaded with mindless action. The Punisher manages to deliver a deep, intense story, solid acting performances and brutal, beyond-the-pail violence that will absolutely bring down the house for anyone who has ever been sick of the flawed justice system.When FBI agent Frank Castle sets up a sting operation involving the son of business mogul and drug lord Howard Saint, young Saint is shot dead by another agent when he resists his arrest. Howard blames the incident on Castle and swears revenge by pain of death, but Saint's wife Livia has a better idea... to murder Frank's entire family, the members of which are holding a reunion vacation in Puerto Rico. Frank is forced to watch his entire family die at the hand of Saint's henchmen, who then attempt to kill Frank himself. Castle escapes his death and, during his recovery, swears punishment on those evil men who are able to craftily slip out of the hands of the law.After Frank moves to a small, rundown, inconspicuous boarding house in Tampa, we are introduced to his colorful neighbors; Joan, played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Bumpo, played by John Pinette and Dave, played by Ben Foster.Joan is a piteous, coy woman who has a knack for romantically interfering with all the wrong men. Bumpo is robust and lovable with just the right quirk factor, though he is somewhat ineffectual in times of difficulty. And Dave (whose ""Spacker"" nickname from the comic books is missing in the film) is neurotic and physically weak, though he is truly courageous and strong in spirit when his help is needed. Together, they bring a fun lightheartedness to the film when needed, without resulting to camp or tired old clichés.I won't spoil the movie for you any further. Suffice it to say that Frank expertly does his enemies in with delightful cunning, and the violence, which is very intense, is somewhat gorgeous in it's pure, raw, just brutality; it's great to see the bad guys REALLY get theirs.I don't know why so many critics have slammed this movie. They seem to want to find any excuse to gripe about the violence, but they seem to miss the real point to the movie: punishment. What would one expect from a movie entitled ""The Punisher""? A fun-loving romp following the adventures of a boy and his sarcastic kangaroo? And you can't tell me that we haven't all fantasized about wiping out the world's evil at one time or another.Another point that critics often make is that it's asinine for Dave to refer to Frank as ""family"". Not true. He is, indeed, a ""them"". An outcast. We are given plenty of chances to observe that all they have is each other. Dave mentions his happiness in that his mother has been let out of prison, yet we the audience can see how discouraging it is that she has not even bothered to visit her son. Joan is recovering from numerous abusive relationships. Bumpo is obviously easily manipulated, and everyone but his ""family"" makes disparaging remarks towards his husky figure. And everyone knows Frank's story. Without each other, without their support and camaradery, they have nothing, and they all genuinely care for each other. For Dave to view them as a family is not laughable, but poignant.The only gripe I have is an exchange between Frank and a friend. Frank's friend advises him to ""Go with God"". Frank assures his friend that ""God's gonna sit this one out"". Not smart, Frank. Being a practicing Catholic, that line kind of bugged me. Other than that, this is a grand spectacle of true justice, and, though not for the faint of heart, the message is clear and moral; those who do evil will be met with punishment.9/10",The Punisher

When people told me that the Russian was in i was dying to see it. When they also told me the rest of the cast included his neighbors from the ""Welcome Home Frank"" series i finally went out to rent it.What i saw was a huge disappointment because of what i expected. The Punisher wouldn't sit down and have dinner. He wouldn't even hint at a flirt with Rebecca's character. In short he wouldn't be so humane! The fight with the Russian is the only thing i enjoyed. Almost an exact copy of the original! Incredible! To sum thing up. For those of you who will see it expecting a good adaptation of the comic don't expect much.

290,Slack_Er,"Well, at least it's better than the Dolph Lundgren version *sigh*",6,17 February 2006,"I haven't read a comic book in over a decade but I still vividly recall my uber-geek memories as a kid flipping through the adventures of Superman, Spider-Man and other spandex loving superheroes. One of my more cherished heroes was of course, The Punisher. Hey, when you're young, you can still accept that a man can storm into a warehouse full of fifty thugs armed with automatic weapons and not only take down every one of them, but come out relatively unscathed! The first attempt at a silver screen Punisher was done during Hollywood's action hero phase. You know, back when guys like Ahney, Sly, and Van Damme could still pull in hundreds of millions of dollars no matter how bad their movies were. So naturally, the Punisher received his own film property featuring everyone's favorite Russian boxer, Dolph Lundgren. I'm not one of those comic book geeks who spends hours arguing on internet message boards over trivial matters such as Spider-Man's comic book mechanical webslinger versus the decision to use Spider-Man's movie version organic webslingers (Let me tell ya, there was almost a nerd revolution over that one!), but I do expect a little bit of faithfulness to the comic book hero that made it all possible. With none of his famous black and skull-faced attire, the Dolph Lundgren Punisher just didn't feel like the Punisher! So I was excited about the new Punisher portrayed by Thomas Jane and what looked to be a full-blown Hollywood budget. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. I even think John Travolta makes for an intriguing villain. But this movie just didn't have the.... well, the ""anything"" to pull me in. It all made sense, it didn't go overboard and make the Punisher as unrealistic as his cross-town vigilante, the Batman. I even approved of some of the Punisher's key background story changes such as having his ENTIRE family slaughtered, not just his wife and kids, because there's nothing like the assassination of your annoying Aunt Helen to drive you over the edge. However, do you ever watch an action fest and realize that if you had written the screenplay, you could have come up with some much cooler ideas? Yeah, unfortunately, this is one of those movies. If you want a cheesy action fest that actually compels you to sit through the entire ordeal, then check out ""Con Air"" or ""The Rock."" The new Punisher did pull me in at first, but as much as I wanted this movie to work, as the plot went on and on, and the characters became less and less interesting, I started to wonder if I was the one being ""punished"" instead of the on-screen bad guys.",The Punisher
291,CrackerJack30,Why is Marvel doing this...,7,3 February 2008,"... to one of their darkest heroes?! This movie should be sinister and frightening, just like the comics.Instead, this piece of crap adds one movie connection to one another without any own or new ideas (espacially the ""Desperado""-Part was simply a lousy copy). The story is as simple as any old 80ties movie, and some of them (like Arnies classic ""Commando"") are way better then ""Punisher"".It's sad, since the beginning of the movie isn't that cheesy, but when we first meet the freaky neighbours of Frank Castle, and the dinner scene took place... Well, then you know you watch a plain awful movie! Even WWE-Star Kevin Nash appears as Popeyes evil brother! Holy cow!Still, the action at the beginning and in the end is very well made, Thomas Jane acts as always (solid B-movie quality), Travolta does a good job as the villain, some other real actors needed money and waste their talent in this one (Will Patton from ""Remember the Titans"", Roy Scheider from ""Jaws""), so, if you are into B-Action-movies with first class special effects, never ever read the ""Punisher"" comics and don't mind a missing storyline, bad jokes & silly sidekicks, you might enjoy this.I for myself think, the next time Avi Arad and Stan Lee should watch ""Sin City"" to see that it is possible to turn a dark comic series into a very good film noir.",The Punisher
292,Cassiopea_Fay,It was OK,4,7 December 2009,"THE BAD: The main role, played by Thomas Jane, was SO SO SO bland. Even when he was suppose to appear in mourning/feel dead inside, there didn't seem to be a proper representation reflecting that. It is more like he was a duller version of a Terminator. Just really bleh, and because of this acting it loses the intensity of the general plot sometimes.John Travolta...poor choice for the bad guy. Failed to convince me - when it comes to playing the serious bad guy role, Travolta is one of the weakest choices of all time.Some of the scenes were cheesy and have been done before. I also felt unsatisfied at the end of the movie. Yes, he does destroy the wealthy mafia family who killed his wife and child, thus fulfilling the revenge (Which WAS Great! Because honestly, that one scene with Castle's entire family being taken down really pisses you off) but I was hoping for a more intellectual comeback also. Explain his actions and really get at the boss through powerful words.THE GOOD: The two nerds in the apartment - especially the one played by Ben Foster. They were sweet and funny, and different. I even liked Rebecca Romijin's role! Those three really added character to the movie, and if weren't for them The Punisher wouldn't of been the same.In conclusion, it was a so-so type of movie.

To be perfectly honest Punisher is a pretty dumb story to begin with, and they made it even dumber. I actually like Thomas Jane to an extent, but he was poorly used. In many cases humanizing a comic book character is a good thing, not here. This movie makes the Punisher look like a big wuss. The grit is gone. He is just too soft. The other attempt at a reboot was also pretty weak. It would be nice to think it possible to adapt Punisher into a decent movie, but some things are just not meant to be realized.

Not just a great comic movie, but a great all around action pick. The action is fierce, the humor is witty. Everything abut the movie just screams pure entertainment. I'm not a huge fan of comic book-based movies, but this really brought my interest back into them. I liked the first two Blades, but the third one killed my interest in comic book movies. Same with the Crow. The Punisher, however, brought back my interest. All of the actors did terrific, and you would never know how small the budget was when your watching it. Everyone did a great job.

The sequel would most likely ditch the drama, so I might actually have to recommend skipping this outing, and waiting for the next. Especially for fans of the comic book.Thomas Jane makes a good Punisher, Travolta does a decent job, although it's very similar to his role in Swordfish, but this outing plays out like a second rate Kill Bill with an unaffecting emotional story that Kill Bill Vol.2 had, but this one is lacking.

The movie has various scenes taken straight from the comic book. The ice pop interrogation is the first one I noticed. The only two things that were Way off, in my opinion were: The Origin and The Ending... Origin: In the comic book Frank Castle's Family (Wife and Kids) were gunned down for being in the wrong place at the wrong time... (Central Park NY) In the movie They gun down his Entire Family (cousins, grandparents, mom, dad, wife, kid, etc.) in another half-assed completely wrong representation of Puerto Rico. (In Puerto Rico there are NO witch doctors, and They DON'T sell shirts with the Punisher Logo to ward off evil spirits.) The logic behind it I suppose is that they needed someplace where Frank could return to the US without needing a passport. Ending: There is only one thing that bothered me in the ending and it was the: ""Blazing Skull"" Punisher is just looking to ""cleanse the world of the disease"" Frank can't go wasting explosives just to show his artistic side. That was just pure unneeded eye candy.The rest of the movie is an OK revenge movie.

297,unimportant,Comic book to big screen transition doesn't quite work,5,10 January 2005,"""The Punisher"" is Frank Castle, a retired FBI agent whose family reunion is crashed by assassins sent to avenge the death of Bobby Saint, killed in a sting orchestrated by an undercover Castle. When Bobby's parents, crime boss Howard and Livia Saint, learn that Castle was responsible for their son's demise, they ""settle the score"" by having Castle, his wife, son, parents, and extended family killed. Castle, however, miraculously survives the massacre, and once he recuperates, he sets out to get revenge on the Saints.Wait, scratch that: ""My actions are not vengeance,"" says The Punisher. No, it's ""punishment.""The Punisher is one of those movies where everyone keeps missing opportunities to kill one another. If the assassins who shot up the family reunion had any sense, they could have shot Castle in the head and been done with the whole thing 30 minutes into the movie. Instead, they half-kill him, and then walk away assuming he will die in the aftermath. But sure, that's how comic books work, and there wouldn't be a movie if the assassins were smart enough to make sure he was really dead.Throughout the movie, though, the bad guys miss so many easy chances to kill Castle. After a few failed attempts, they send in their toughest hit-man, but oops, he forgets to bring a gun! Castle himself is a bit of a bonehead; with everyone thinking he's dead, he has the perfect opportunity to surprise his victims, but instead, he announces to the media that he's still alive, and just in case Howard Saint doesn't watch the news, Castle gives him a personal greeting. While he's making his lengthy preparations, he's a sitting duck in his apartment, where all the bad guys know he lives.The actual punishment sequence is OK. The Punisher thinks of clever and cruel ways to punish Howard Saint and his minions, and kills a lot of people in creative ways. Unfortunately, the movie just drags along until the grand finale. The movie brings in some minor characters (three neighbors in Castle's apartment complex, and an insider in the Saints' operations), from the comic book, but they seem extraneous, and don't really contribute much to The Punisher's revenge, er, punishment. Ultimately, The Punisher's transition from comic book to big screen just doesn't quite work. (5/10)",The Punisher
298,zac-warsteiner,Yet another remake that shouldn't have been...,1,3 February 2012,"This movie spoiled before it came out on DVD, but this review might help a little.I'm actually still in the process of watching this shamefully repugnant crapfest spewed out by the so-called director Jonathan Hensleigh, who should stick to writing, as he doesn't suck quite so badly at that. The movie itself didn't need to be made, especially in that the timing was WAY off, and therefore couldn't capitalize on the waning popularity of the hero.The Punisher is the half-assed story of a man whose family is slaughtered by the clichéd all black clothing wearing henchmen of a half-assed criminal who tries to emote too much, has trouble keeping his half-assed criminal 'empire' under control when the slightest hitch occurs, and whose half-assed genes seem to skip generations. The half-assed hero goes from being a half-assed supposed super-cop in a pathetically contrived half-assed 'sting operation', to a (finally not half-assed) loser who can't protect a single member of his apparently blind family (Really, who can't see a group of all black wearing gunmen wandering slowly towards you? Were they all blind-drunk?), to a (back to being half-assed) super-vigilante with all the tactical skill and equipment to handle anything except a giant Russian guy, and of course keeping any single member of his entire extended family alive. The rest of the story is just co-stars trying to keep the movie from being a total failure, and an admittedly excellent study on what happens when somebody gets to run a movie into the ground because somebody else didn't keep him on a leash. None of this is spoiler material as the half-assed plot would have been obvious to a dead extended family.On the plus side, you get to see John Pinette lip sync himself some opera and constantly be cooking. Almost a stand-up bit come to life.

My comments may be due to the genre that this comic book is about.  The punisher has no special powers, no magic of any form, but what he does have is the icredible lust for revenge. After Frank Castle's family is murdered by a mob boss and his crew, all he wants is his revenge.  The movie seemed to move slow at times, and was a constant shoot-em-up kind of film.

The Punisher is the classic anti-hero superhero. He doesn't want the villains in jail; he wants them in their graves. The only way to portray this character is to show the violence done to him, and how he deals his own brand of justice. This movie delivers in spades of gory detail. This adaptation of the character couldn't have been done better. This is the way he needed to be shown. Those who hate violent movies will be disgusted by what they see, but if want to see the comic book character brought to life in a very real way - see this movie. It was better than expected, and very consistent and watchable. A solid movie with a high body count. Besides the violence, the movie has some humor, and heart. Very well done.

Call me...The Punisher,"" are Frank Castle's departing words. ""The Punisher"" (2004) is a film based on marvel comic book collection of The Punisher starring Thomas Jane as anti-hero, Frank Castle.Castle is an FBI agent and U.S. Army Delta Force operator whose family is murdered at a retirement party for Castle in Puerto Rico. Castle appears undercover as an European arms dealer, Otto Kreig, whom allegedly died in a shootout with Bobby Saint while Mickey Duka is jailed . When a mob discovers Kreig isn't dead and he goes by the name of Castle, chaos erupts and a witch-hunt begins.Castle's extended family is killed immediately as his wife and son are ran over by a truck in an attempt to escape. When Castle falls upon his dead family he becomes a different man- a man who is left alone in the world. He declares war on the mob for killing his wife and son. In preparation of leaving Puerto Rico for Tampa, Florida, Castle meets a fisherman who gives him a black t-shirt with a white face of the Punisher on it that his son originally gave him. He is told by his son that the t-shirt is to keep ""evil spirits"" away thus it becomes a character in the film.This action/thriller film keeps me on my toes throughout its entirety. It has a dark and depressing tone as Castle finds redemption in assembling guns, grenades, knives, and explosives. Castle's mission is to kill everyone in the mob--significant others and children. After all, what's worse than being stabbed in the back, punched in the gut, and having a hole drilled in a your head?...Torturing your loved ones! ""The Punisher"" sparks many reactions from me. A few lines make me chuckle with Castle's friends of misfits, and I cringe in a couple of scenes forcing a hand over my face only to peek through my fingers. I don't want to see a knife being shoved underneath someones chin meeting the roof of his mouth only to see the blade, or watch as piercings are plucked one by one out a face in an attempt to make one of the misfits forfeit information. I can't, however, miss a beat.The Punisher is skilled in his murderous attempts. What I find most intriguing about this film is that Castle is not an over-sized hero shot up with steroids having an extremely large chest and muscles that can pick up a 400 ton truck with his pinkie finger. He is a fit man, leading an ""ordinary"" life with his wife and son until he ticked off the wrong person. ""The Punisher"" can be viewed much like ""The Godfather,"" an Italian Mafia, rendering drugs and weapons who has a lot of pull in his community and country causing a whirlwind of chaos to those who encounter him.Killers, rapists, psychos, and sadists better watch out because the Punisher isn't going to have any sympathy for those who do evil things. He is a true vigilante.",The Punisher
305,Shandara,So much better than I thought it was going to be!,10,18 April 2004,"Okay, I thought from the trailer that this movie was going to be good--it looked like the conflict in the story would be well established and that more thought had gone into the story than in the earlier version of The Punisher--but I have to say that my expectations of a good time were nowhere near the reality.  This movie just plain rocked!Not only did I get sucked into hoping against hope that the bad stuff that I knew had to happen wouldn't happen, but I also found myself laughing my butt off at the humor in the movie.  The Punisher is a dark comic to begin with and not all of Hollywood has learned that just a touch of humor can make a good movie great, so I expected that this would be a pretty dark film--hopefully good, but definitely dark.  But between a talented and diabolical writer, a wonderful cast of actors, and a skilled director, this good movie became great.Don't get me wrong, it had its predictable moment--and if you're looking for ""deeper meaning"" or ""art,"" forget it.  But if you want a fun movie with lots of explosions and some truly wicked ways of dealing with the baddies, The Punisher is your flick. Let me sum it up like this, my hubby and I spent ten bucks a pop to go see it last night (opening night) and we're going to go see it again tomorrow night.  A movie had better be d@mn good for me to see it twice at full price in one weekend.",The Punisher

We intended on seeing Kill Bill 2, but unfortunately the theater we went to wasn't showing it. We all decided to see this which was starting shortly after we arrived I wasn't expecting Citezen Kane, but I figured John Travolta, Thomas Jane, and R-rating. Should be pretty good. Wrong. You know when the version starring Dolph Lundgren and produced by the Cannon group 15 years earlier is much better something is seriously wrong. The Punisher is supposed to be dark and disturbing.

307,rhadooxxl,"Things I liked, things I hated about it",9,19 January 2008,"OK, lets get started: Things I liked: -Thomas Jane gives a good all round performance on this one, his best I think.Kinda like Christofer Lambert in the first Immortal movie. -It's a nice throwback to the action movies of the '70's,with lots of action, blood and bullets flying everywhere. -it stays faithful to the comics in atmosphere, it is dark, like the source material,something different from the family friendly spandex superheroes. Those who said it was too dark:watch Winnie the Pooh and shut up, it was just like it was suppose to be. A big thumbs up on this one. -Rebbeca Romjin gives a good performance, as does the whole cast. Good work from the casting director. Things I hated: Not many, just one actually: -The dialog wasn't that well written, it does have it's good lines, but some are just corny All in all, it is one of the best comic book adaptations you will find out there, so if you're sick of classic superhero types, like Superman or Spiderman, watch The Punisher. You'll love it",The Punisher
308,ariakos,Not exactly the Frank I know (of).,6,18 November 2004,"In short, The Punisher would be a-OK action movie, if the ""hero"" was just an anonymous guy we have never heard of before. Now, let's face the fact: this is THE Punisher. At least it's supposed to be. And although I do understand that a movie adaptation can not be 100% accurate compared to the comics, I still find this movie lacking those things that ultimately make Frank Castle The Punisher in the first place.Acting, directing and cutting is all fine by me in the film. Couple of years ago I was purely hypothetically wondering, who would be the best actor for Frank Castle, but I couldn't think of anyone. Thomas Jane was almost perfect for the role and thank God for him. Others did OK, too. Overall, I don't find much to complain about the actual making of the movie, because it's greatest flaws were already done in the script itself.What I did find most disturbing was the compromises that were made between realism and the original comic world. Sure, some foolish things from the comic version (like the Russian) were included, but I can live with that. Absolutely as the worst of all the very heart of comic-Punisher's motivation for violent rampage on criminality was seriously altered. Castle's talk about ""this is not vengeance"" was all empty and hollow, because that's exactly what the whole movie was all about: vengeance. Not punishment, at least not yet. And he did seem to enjoy the ""punishing"" a little bit too much at the end of the movie. The Crow-ripoff (if you've seen it, you know what I mean) was just stupid.Maybe I'm too harsh on this one. After all, it was an OK movie, as I earlier stated. It's just that... The Punisher as a character has a lot more potential than this movie ever used. Naturally as a Punisher-fan I did have a lot of expectations for this movie and obviously it did partly fail me because of those strong expectations.Tell you what, though. I do hope they make a sequel, because I honestly do anticipate to see The Punisher actually start punishing, without any personal attachments to his work. Because that is the core of the comic character we know as The Punisher. Hopefully the makers have the backbone to continue with a non-compromising sequel. And make it NC-17, will ya? Heroes like Spiderman can be done for kids too. Anti-heroes like The Punisher, however, should be strictly entertainment for grown-ups with critical and rational sense of reasoning. Any less is just unnecessary pampering.",The Punisher
309,simonwood666,Another true comic book adaption!!,9,25 April 2004,"I am quite a big Punisher fan and was bowled over by how true the comic this film really was.

311,UberLemming,At last a semi decent com2film translation,8,21 May 2004,"Although this film has received mixed reviews I can quite happily say I really enjoyed it.One of the outstanding features of the whole file is that it's dark... very dark. Critics have slammed it for this alone but come-on, your family gets whacked, you aren't going to be all smiles at the local Bingo hall a couple of months later are you..... :o). Thomas Jane was brilliant as Frank Castle and it's good to see he put in the effort to beef up for the role rather than rely on brand for success. Another example of Jane going all out for a role see. Boogie Nights!!!!!.Whilst some of the accompanying cast (i.e. Frank's new friends) could be classed as extraneous to the plot, I thought the balance of dark and good was a happy balance and added a decent feel good feeling to the film. In addition, I thought all were obscure enough to have been lifted from the comic's pages and so weren't at all intrusive.Compare to the Hulk <shudder> and other cheesy C2F adaptations this is a goodun.I also recommend seeing Hellboy as the translation of C2F is equally as good.",The Punisher
312,Xianghong,One person being punished is enough.,6,2 February 2015,"I should have seen it coming. Ever since the appalling train wreck that was Battlefield Earth, my faith in John Travolta has been irrevocably lost and not even the deliciously fun Swordfish could have restored it. And now The Punisher has hammered the final nail in the coffin. Retaining the hairstyle but none of his coolness, Travolta has been transformed from slick yet deranged terrorist into a vindictive pansy of a mafia boss. How the mighty have fallen! If it's any consolation, if Battlefield Earth was a train wreck, then The Punisher can best be described as a car crash.What started off as an innovative concept by Marvel Comics in 1974 has ended in utter disaster. A superhero with no super powers except a near unbreakable constitution (surviving being riddled with bullets and a huge explosion) and a badass attitude, not unlike Daredevil, was a daring innovation. Unfortunately, the movie will be heading in the same direction. Somebody apparently didn't realise two things: that not only kids read comic books and the absence of CG doesn't automatically qualify a movie as serious. Or vice versa.Normally, an in-your-face delivery style works fine for me, especially for an action flick, so as not to end up pretentious. But in this film, it gets really suffocating after a while. The total lack of subtlety, pointless (almost gratuitous) violence and uninspired script will kill off even the most hardcore Punisher fan base. I actually found myself wishing for some CG to cover up for the routine shoot/blow 'em up sequences. I expect director and writer Jonathan Hensleigh to start receiving plenty of death threats from disgruntled fans.In addition, the number of clichÃ (C)s and stereotypes employed in the show rivals that of Harry Potter books (and that's saying a lot). Hero happens to be checking out the hardware with his pop when the assassins arrive, enabling them to defend themselves. Hero locked in hand-to- hand combat with Russian man-mountain and destroying furniture while his three misfit neighbours prance around to the tune of ""La donna Ã (C) mobile"". Hero blows up an entire building/car park just to kill a lackey or make a point. Hero shooting guards that all-too-familiar bow and arrow, etc.Is there any saving grace to this otherwise dreary, vapid movie? Surprisingly, yes. Some of the scenes and dialogue were actually hilarious (albeit almost certainly unintentional) considering how campy they can get. Thomas Jane is convincing as the broody protagonist, tormented by his family's demise and yearning to quench his thirst for blood. His stalwart acting more or less single- handedly held up the flimsy excuse of a movie. It's a pity the rest of the movie couldn't match up.Older fans of The Punisher may remember watching its first cinematic release starring Dolph Lundgren in 1989. It bombed. With the recent spate of interest in comic book adaptations, now is a good chance for it to redeem itself and establish itself among the ranks of runaway hits like Spiderman or X-Men or join the rest in the discount bins with Daredevil and Hulk. No prizes for guessing where it'll end though. Folks, do yourselves a favour and give this show a miss. One person being punished is enough.",The Punisher
313,stefan_willa,Yet another example of entertainment by vigilantism,4,15 April 2014,"The Punisher has quite a good cast, which might distract from the fact, that there is nothing really new about the story. It seems that the initial murdering just happens to give the main character's trained body a purpose in killing vast amounts of people. The police are portrayed as too weak, so that ""The Punisher"" has a reason for vigilantism. It is interesting that while he is still in the police, they are way more clever than without him afterwards.As for the music, there is nothing really to take note of except for a typically Hollywood-ignorant abuse of a Verdi opera as a comic relief. All in all the movie lacks creativity and a good story. It is only interesting for those of you who are just looking for some quick mindless action.",The Punisher

Granted, it does have one or two redeeming qualities, such as the blowtorch scene in the first half of the movie, but otherwise it just feels like a waste of time. I had more fun imagining how the film would've been like if I were directing/producing/acting/composing/whatever than actually watching it. I'd only recommend this film to those who appreciate little else than whimsically unrealistic plots and a degree of action film flare that was standard 20 years ago.

315,Darkknight575,Punisher Is Just Plain Awfulk,1,1 August 2007,"I'm not really sure what fan boy in his right mind could like this movie. It's completely ridiculous. Nothing makes any sense. One of the worst movies ever written and made. Being a huge fan of the Punisher I was completely appalled as to how bad they made it. It's one of the only movies I've ever walked out of. And I wasn't alone. Half the audience left with me. And being a fan of action films makes it even worse. This is a terrible action movie too. What an embarrassment.1. They don't explain how an officer like Frank Castle could be found so easily by a criminal like Howard Saint so easily. It would have been a great way to show how powerful this guy is. Instead we're asked to just believe he is.2. Why does Frank Castle have to retire from his job? A pension at his age wouldn't pay for anything. He'd still have to find another job.3. Which brings us to the next and more important question. Why deviate from the Punisher's actual origin from the comic book? Instead of killing his wife and child we have to kill his whole family. A bunch of people we don't get to know or feel for at all. It takes away from the power and emotion of the actual act. And the senselessness of the killing in the book is extremely powerful.4. When Frank's wife and kid are about to be run over and killed how in the world does Frank even know where they are? We never see him watch them escape or anything. Just all of sudden he takes off, which the way it was filmed seems like it's far away since you have to drive, and he shows up too late. Is the Punisher psychic or something now? 5. The way everyone thinks Frank Castle is dead is pretty absurd. Seriously? And then he's found by some other guy that actually has to say he's his friend so we know who he is. Then months later he looks like a hermit and decides to go after the people who killed his family. When do we get to see his pain? His suffering? I could go on and on here. There's just too much to list. This movie should be burned and destroyed for all time.The Punisher vs the Russian fight was pretty cool though. Right from the book. That was the only positive.",The Punisher
316,martinphipps2,A damn good movie,10,5 November 2004,"The Punisher is a damn good movie. This is coming from somebody who never understood the appeal of the Death Wish or Dirty Harry movies.I suppose those movies would appeal to you if you believed that any consideration of human rights only served to interfere in carrying out of the righteous slaughter of the criminal element of society.Nevermind the debate on capital punishment, let's just skip the arrest, the trial and jury deliberations and just shoot criminals on sight! Hell, for that matter, why should I take the time to recommend this movie at all when I obviously strongly disagree with the very notion that any one man has the right to decide who lives and who dies? Indeed, there is even the subtle implication in the phrase ""this is not revenge but punishment"" that suggests that The Punisher is acting out of righteous indignation when he plays the role of judge, jury and executioner!Thing is, as I said, this is a good movie, probably too good for the genre which is why it, ironically, didn't do as well as might have been expected.The basic problem, I suppose, was that this is not quite the same character as in the comics: in the comics, The Punisher was a Vietnam War vet who, after seeing his family shot down in a gangland style massacre in Central Park, snapped and started going after all criminals. I presume that he did so with the objective of, in the process, killing the people responsible for his family's death but, in the comics anyway, he didn't see it so much as his personal revenge but as some kind of war. The movie character is slightly different in the sense that Frank Castle (Thomas Jane), having apparently finished his military service, had been working for the FBI, hunting down the very criminals who ended up killing his family. In the movie, the murder of his family is no longer random and neither is his response. The result is a more thoughtful, more methodical character who can imagine more inventive ways of punishing you than simply blowing your head off.The fact that Frank Castle didn't go straight to Howard Saint(John Travolta)'s home and blow his head off in act one was, no doubt, a source of great frustration to fans of the Death Wish and Dirty Harry movies. (Indeed, the character of the Punisher in the comics was no doubt inspired by these movies.)I must confess that I, too, was a bit confused seeing Frank Castle taking pictures and carrying around a fake fire hydrant. But where is the satisfaction in seeing the villain die without first being made to suffer?When Frank Castle's plan started to come together, I was satisfied to see that he had taken the time to play with his opponents head before blowing it off.After all, when a man has killed your entire family, one has the obligation to go to the extra effort of attacking him on more than one level!Of course, we are ""treated"" to scenes in which the villains are shown to be truly evil so that we don't feel bad about their demise (much in the same way that the wedding massacre was shown over and over again in Kill Bill 1 & 2 in the hopes that we wouldn't start routing for the ""bad"" guys): Howard Saint kills one of his own men, his wife (Laura Harring) orders the massacre of Frank Castle's family, his second-in-command (Will Patton) carries it out and his surviving son has the honour of actually (making an attempt at) killing Frank Castle in revenge for his brother's death.Even so, Frank Castle's neighbour (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) asks the obvious question ""What makes you any different from them?""Well, he isn't any different. That was the point of the comics when he first appeared as a villain in the Spiderman series, a point that got lost along the way when he went on to get his own series. But in this movie I was able to root for this protagonist precisely because he was following the golden rule and doing unto the villains exactly as they had planned to do to him. Indeed, as I have already stated above, for Frank Castle to have killed Howard Saint in the first act would have made the rest of the movie not only anti-climactic but would have rendered the movie completely soulless with Frank Castle going on to kill random drug dealers with whom he didn't have a personal grudge.Of course, with that in mind, I dread to think what a sequel to this movie would be like. Presumably, in a sequel, Frank Castle would be no different from the character in the comics, deciding who lives and who dies on the spot and without any sense of remorse, one way or the other. While I understand Thomas Jane's enthusiasm in wanting to make a sequel, I no sooner want to spend two hours watching the Punisher shoot people than I would want to watch a Hulk sequel which was merely two hours of ""Hulk Smash!""Of course, there is always the chance, should a Punisher sequel ever be made, that I might be pleasantly surprised, yet again. Maybe.",The Punisher

I'm not sure why studios don't DIRECTLY adapt the comic book versions of films and simply put the original writer on the staff, but as things go, this was a good story, pretty close to the origins of the Punisher ( except his family are killed in , I think, Central Park and not at the beach in the comics, but it worked OK in the film )So , anyway, I'll truncate my review.The new punisher ( 2004) Fun, Violent, funny, Violent, pretty tight on the comic & DESERVES A SEQUEL.

320,hornany,Pretty good.,7,5 January 2006,"This movie is borderline great in its depiction of the Marvel vigilante The Punisher. The comic is one of the best pieces of continuing serial comic books out right now, and i felt that this movie would be generally unsatisfying. Its based on one of my favorite comics, after all. The movie, surprisingly enough, didn't even try to change the Garth Ennis Frank Castle, instead the movie just translated it and adapted it, and put it on celluloid. I found that the bleak feel and look contributed to the movies all around goodness. The violence, while generic and funny, was decently executed and well shot. The director wanted a Sergio Leone type revenge picture, and made a good version of the Punisher for the screen. The fact that it was dark and depressing didn't weigh down my experience at all. In fact, i found the movie to be a lot less depressing than i've heard people say. The problems with the movie begin with the story. I know that the studio couldn't go with the original Castle story, because his war effort in Vietnam was almost 40 years prior to the movie, so we'd have to have a period piece or a a 70 year old Castle. Thats fine, its just the Gulf War doesn't have the same feel as Nam in terms of resonance. The best and worst things are the guns. I would've loved to see more guns. He had stockpiled a whole storage center full. So, yeah. It sucked he only used an m4, bow and arrow, shotgun and a couple of cool looking .45's. But there are crates and crates of other guns, damn it!Also, i didn't like the kid or the wife. But you know what, Travolta, Roy Schieder, and Tom Jane balanced that out. The movies best part is the Russian fight, and thats no joke. He is fighting a Russian. Those Russians, they are so big. I mean, this Russian is 6'5''? 6'6''? Whatever. Hes a big mofo.

I'm still not sure if the problem were the previews, the early reviews or the buzz, but something kept me away from it. Spider sense, maybe? It's a very simple revenge story. Good guy kills bad guy's son, bad guy kills good guy's whole family, good (?) guy kills everyone else. In a way, it's The Punisher, but it also isn't. It has all the elements from the recipe, but something very subtle is still missing.I'd say the direction is uninspired to say the least. It's not gritty nor very exciting. In fact, there's ONE really amazing sequence in the whole movie - the one with the Russian guy. All the rest is pretty bland. The creative team never REALLY makes use of the whole mythos or even the equipment. The car is totally underused, a mortal sin in this kind of movie.The one good thing about this one is the script.

The writing is not top notch, but it manages to convey a pretty good sense of realism and pain.This is one to be seen on DVD and with no expectations. I ended up liking it, but I'm still not sure if it's worth 2 hours of my time.",The Punisher
328,litchy03,Great punishment,8,26 August 2013,The tone of this movie is why it worked. It's a dark serous film that most comic book films shy away from( apart from the Dark Night trilogy) Thomas Jane portrayed Frank Castle down to a tee. He made this character his own and that's one of the many reasons the second film failed. Frank castle didn't come across as invincible he took a lot of punishment as well as delivering his own he made the audience really feel for him.John Travolta was also great in this film. He plays a great villain and you can see in his performance that he enjoyed it. The film stayed true to the film with the hit men sent to kill him. The guitar playing assassin that play him a song before trying to kill him was so true to the comic and not to mention the Russians fight scene was entertaining.If you're looking for the usual Marvel superhero movie this is not it but if you're looking for a film with a strong story great down to earth action this film is it,The Punisher
329,iqusoe,awesome kick a** movie,10,3 February 2005,i give this movie a 10 because its the only movie that truly serves its name right.The punisher violent name violent movie. The basic plot is that castle (Thomas Jane) is in special forces gets this crooked bankers son killed on a bad deal. Then Mr. saint(the banker)wants to revenge his sons death and decides to kill Castle's entire family and of course Castle. Castle barley survives all this by ways of a witch doctor then Frank Castle is no longer Frank Castle hes the punisher then all hell breaks loose. Overall the movie rocks there is some nudity and some language and some very brutal violence which makes the movie even better.So if you are a person who like kick a** action this is the movie for you.,The Punisher

With most of the roles that Thomas Jane has played this one is one of his better performances. It's like how Ryan Reynolds (before Deadpool 2) is perfect for a role. I wish he would have done the 2nd Punisher.

He's just not mean enough. He is not scary at all. All I could think of is his goofy grin in Grease and Pulp Fiction.I watched the initial scene twice where the whole plot is set up, and I couldn't figure out what happened for the life of me. Who were the two kids buying drugs? Why were they on the docks playing the big leagues? What did Frank Castle do in this scene?

The ""professional"" critics don't have much of a clue about the character or the story.  This movie had great action, great characters, what it lacked in ""depth"" was easily answerable to time constrains and set-up movie.  (Look at X-Men, everyone complained about how the characters lacked depth... but as a setup film, it was great)  This movie sets a good tone for sequels and allows Frank to becomes more morbid and more wicked to those who are evil.  To the critics I say this... Star Wars.  The most dominating and beloved film of the 20th Century.  Yes more than Godfather. The critics destroyed that film, it has since gone on to inspire generations, define a culture, and capture the hearts and minds of millions.

340,Kriss-kevin21,Perfect adaptation,9,10 February 2011,"The greatest thing about The Punisher is that the changes they made from the comic book actually serve to make it a better movie. The murdering of his entire extended family instead of just his wife and kids make his motivation even stronger and serves to make John Travolta even more sinister. The film is basically a modern day western. The score sets that mood perfectly and while at times melodramatic, it is a great score. The movie is directed artfully and the action ,while intense, always has sort of classiness to it. Unlike the Punisher Warzone, which is just a piece of crap movie (avoid at all costs).Thomas Jane plays a wonderful Frank Castle, giving his that brooding dark edge from the comic but also humanizing him. He has a very expressive face that makes the action sequences more that just him being angry, you can actually track his thought process by watching his face. I have seen this movie many times and every time by the end I am incredibly pumped up. Also it should be mentioned that the ending is super satisfying. It is a shame that this movie never got the true sequel it deserved.",The Punisher

Yesterday evening I saw at the cinema ""Sky captain"" and confronted to this it was an Oscar favourite. No credibility whatsoever, I don't know the comic but this is completely stupid and nonsense. The director try to throw in some hilarious moments just to keep the building up, but it fails miserably As an action movie, as a movie itself. Wonder why Mr. Travolta accepts this kind of scripts There's only one stupid question in my mind: how the hell a bullet SHOT FROM LESS THAN A FEET RIGHT TO YOUR HEART DOES NOT KILL YOU??? In the end I was hoping the hero would have killed himself. I usually am for the happy end but this was the one and ONLY end possible for this thing. Cheers",The Punisher
342,lcagold,"Uneven, but entertaining.",6,2 March 2006,"Not having read the comic or seen the Dolph version, I will not go on a fan-boy rant about fidelity to source material. I'll stick to the film itself as it stands on its own.The film kept me entertained, and that is my primary benchmark for a film. However, there were parts that entertained me more, and I feel that is due to a lack of commitment to a concept of who the Punisher really is.It almost seemed to me that different writers and directors filmed their own punisher shorts with the same actors, then strung them together into a movie. Watching this movie reminded me of Four Rooms (1995). Visually it was pretty consistent, but conceptually it was drastically different from sequence to sequence.The most notable fluctuation is in the level of grit. Sometimes the Punisher seems to be reluctant to resort to direct violence, sometimes he revels in it. Sometimes his actions are carefully and painstakingly justified by the story, sometimes he slaughters indiscriminately.It's as if we see three different Punishers: one who uses clever manipulation to ruin his target's life and make them destroy themselves as if in a Greek tragedy; one who follows the archetypical gunslinger hero ethos of only attacking when provoked and never drawing first; and one who will slaughter, maim, and even shoot in the back anyone who gets in the way of his goal.I liked all three, but it made the film seem uneven. I get the feeling they wanted to have their cake and eat it too. They wanted to have a gritty, ultra-violent film; but they didn't want to have a straight up anti-hero. If they had picked one of the three paths that lay before them, I feel the film would have been much better.While other revenge films that stick to their guns (or lack of them) might be better (Get Carter (1971), The Sting (1973), High Plains Drifter (1973), Payback (1999), or the Kill Bills (2003, 2004)), I would say The Punisher is well worth investing 124 minutes in.",The Punisher

It was incredibly well done and I never even liked the punisher before. Badillion thumbs up!  All I can say is that this was the opposite of Hellboy right down to the characters' one-liners.  Hellboy's ""Cut to the end, how do I kill it?"" VS The Punisher's ""God's gonna sit this one out."" ? No contest. The Punisher was an awesome movie that hooks you right from the intro till the end.

They are violent and people do not always die on accident. This is why THE PUNISHER was suck a great film with it's paper cutters to the head and R rating. It showed that marvel comics is not all spiderman and web slinging but knifes through the teeth and arrows through the neck. I only wish that people could have figured that out when Daredevil came out and I saw Mom's pulling their 7 year old kids out of the theater because they could not believe he did not pull Casada up from in front of the train.

Thomas Jane could've been an excellent Punisher if they built a watchable movie around him, but they sure didn't. They turned the movie into a bad soap opera storyline that would've been right at home on General Hospital or something. John Travolta's character is just absolutely hammy and brutal to watch. You don't hate him like a classic villain, you want him to go away. The Punisher should not have WACKY side kick buddies. He should not do funny little gags to screw with the villains. He should brutalize them like a bad ass. If anyone has seen Last Man Standing with Bruce Willis, that's more how I would've imagined the Punisher character dealing with his enemies.

Tom Jane gives a great performance as everyone's skulled brutal hero. The reason I enjoyed this movie so much is because the director, did not go and make a movie full of cgi and crappy special effects but, stayed with an old school formula from old fashioned action films. I really wish the movie had more action though. There are a couple of things that could have made it a bit better, more action, more weapons. There are tons of explosions, and guys getting shot, (this is not a kids movie!). The Punisher is not for everyone, for it contains graphic violence of Frank Castle's family getting shot.

It's also yet another comic book adaptation done properly. In fact, this may be the first time I wished we could give half-vaults, because it was just that good. In the compendium of comic movies, this falls just shy of the two X-Men movies, but it is right there with Spider-Man and easily surpasses Batman, Superman and The Hulk. The fact that it is an R-rated movie will kill any possible chance of decent box-office numbers, but it was a necessary step to take, and the quality of the movie just makes up for it. Hopefully this was Thomas Jane's breakout role, as he was outstanding and has the potential to be a contender to Ben Affleck, Hugh Jackman, Colin Farrell, and Matt Damon as the next middleweight action star. If you like action movies, check out this movie. If you like comic book adaptations, check out this movie. Heck, if you just like movies in general, The Punisher is two hours well-spent.

After all that is what the punisher movie is about, making a comic book character fit into the real world with realistic situations.This guy could be anyone out there with a vendetta up against believable enemies. There are no superpowers on show here just a guy with a vendetta up against a powerful man that wants him killed who can afford to hire realistic killers with personality I might add, to do the jobThis goes down as one of my favorite films of all time mainly because of the beautiful camera work and realistic gritty style action.

This is like a Spider-Man film where we only see Spidey web-swinging twice. And basically everything in between the action scenes is painfully acted and badly written. The hideous alt-rock soundtrack does not help, either.I went in expecting a body-count like an 80's action film or a John Woo gun-ballet. What I got was a generic modern action movie where the main character has a skull on his chest.

Adapting that character, in your first directorial assignment, for a group of rabid fanboys is ever more difficult. Hensleigh does a decent enough job his first time out. The script was good, some little plot holes, and a little cheezy. The cheese is important though, adapting Garth Ennis' Welcome Back Frank requires you to take that little bit of goofiness with you. The real problem with the script lies in the plot holes. If the Punisher is after you, and you know this, why do you let your wife run around town all alone? Why do you not beef up your home security? Also, if you come to The Punisher's apartment, and see a giant, Russian assassin laying dead on the floor, do you think leaving one guy behind is going to cut it? Tom Jane just takes this role and runs with it. He is Frank Castle. There are not enough good things to say about his performance, and nothing bad about it. All I will say is that I cannot imagine anyone else in that role.
Travolta was toned down here. He wasn't chewing up the scenery in this role. He played the cheesiness up though. He did little things that I enjoyed. The way he walked, mannerisms, smoking a pipe. All those little things that he did really worked. Again, you can't fault the performers for a slightly weak script. The Punisher is a great adaptation, very true to the source, and the changes only enhance the mythos. It's just those little plot holes....",The Punisher

As a big fan of The Punisher comic book series, I can honestly say this is a very close adaptation of the comics. Although it is based off of a comic series, you could be a fan of action movies and still enjoy this film without ever knowing that The Punisher started out in comic book form.Thomas Jane is great as Frank Castle/The Punisher. He brings a very dark and somber mood into the film, which is how it should be. John Travolta is wonderful as the psychotic and delusional Howard Saint. He pulls off being insane really well(?), especially in the scene where he is talking to Quentin Glass (Will Patton) before he kills him. Rebecca Romijn is good in her role of the young, reformed girl who knows the evils of the world all too well. The rest of the cast is very good as well.This movie also has some very entertaining action sequences. The scene that first comes to mind is the scene where the mastodon comes through the door to Frank Castle's apartment and a brutal (but sometimes funny) fight ensues. Another scene that comes to mind is when Howard Saint (John Travolta) is being dragged by a car into what is a parking lot full of cars with bombs on them. The Punisher detonates the bombs and what appears is the The Punisher's trademark skull. Absolutely brilliant!So, if you're a fan of the series or a fan of action flicks, or just want to see a good movie, this would be a good route to go.",The Punisher
353,WisdomSeed,Surprisingly well done.,9,27 August 2005,"For some reason, I did not have high expectations for this movie, probably because of the Previous Dolph Lundgren version. While I was familiar with the character from Marvel comics. Even in the Marvel Universe, he was not exactly a standout, But he was a decent enough character, with a no-reason-to-live-except-one kind of attitude. In this movie, we get to understand and fully why he only had one reason to live. Tom Jane did for the Punisher what Hugh Jackman did for Wolverine, he played the living daylights out of this character. The story was well with its Shakesperean-soap opera overtones that give it the right amount off depth (anyone familiar with Marvel Comics will already be aware of the degree of soap opera Marvel goes to). I was also surprised that the movie was able to pull off a sort off New York darkness (where the comic books took place if I remember correctly) in sunny Miami.

But suspension of disbelief is a must for this film (as it often is for an action picture), for without it, one could easily and flippantly cast this movie aside. This is a comic book on film, and Hensleigh most definitely delivers in this respect. This is an ""OH $hit"" action flick, as you'll find yourself saying it over and over again as the violent acts become increasingly creative.

Frank Castle is both tragic and scary, working his manipulations perfectly throughout the movie.You can't really cheer on Castle, for some of what he does transcends what we might call justice.

I always have a complaint when it comes to comic book movies that never ever seems to get solved and that is the origins. Yet again this is one of those films that does not stick to the source material when it comes to re-telling the origins. The Punisher is the Punisher because of the life changing events that happen to him. In the comic books Frank Castle's family is killed in cross fire from a gangster shoot out,this event causes Castle to take the law into his own hands and become the Punisher. The origins in the movie differs greatly, although it still works. Tom Jane played the Punisher competently, he actually made me believe he was the Punisher. The casting of John Travota as the villain was a bad choice, although he is a brilliant actor he just isn't a convincing villain for the Punihser to face.

To the Punisher fan, this movie does not disappoint.  While it strays from its comic-book origins a few times, it FOR THE MOST PART stays true to the ""Welcome Back, Frank"" story-line from a few years back...except that Johnathan Hensleigh added a little part in that is...well, creative and well-thought-out.I gave this movie a score of ""6""; when I reviewed the original ""Punisher"" movie starring Dolph Lundgren, I gave it a ""3"".  I based these ratings upon the opinions of the average movie-goer.  If I had based them solely upon the fact that I am a Punisher fan, the first would've gotten a ""1"", and the new one would've gotten a ""9"" for the sake of comparison.Basically, if you're a Punisher fan in need of a movie to satisfy the hole that Dolph's abomination left in you, this'll do for now.

359,beasley-1,what an elaborate waste of time,2,18 April 2004,"I really wanted this to be good. I used to read the comic book and was already disappointed with the first Punisher film, so I really wanted to like it. And I will say that the PLOT was good, as was Mr. Jane, well as good as he could be due to the material. Now speaking of the material, the dialogue sounded like a ten year old wrote it. With lines like ""God's going to sit this one out"" and ""Frank Castle is dead...Call me the Punisher,"" as well as the touching lines delivered by Mrs. Stamos for inspiration (""Don't let your memories kill you""), I couldn't help but laugh. Mr. Travolta I think gave the worst performance in the film; I believe it to have been on par with his acting in Battlefield Earth, and just so I don't get crucified, I do think he's a good actor, if given good material to work with. (SPOILER AHEAD) But again I was laughing the entire time he was being dragged by the car and letting out those high pitched squeals. While I'm on that scene, I just have to ask what the point was in making those cars blow up in the shape of a skull. I don't understand it. If I was planning this elaborate revenge (sorry, punishment), I don't think I would get out the design sheets and waste a couple of hours plotting out which cars to attach bombs to in order to make a skull appear for the traffic helicopters. Now I'd like to back up a bit. I will say I liked the scene with the Russian. However, the man from Memphis was just ridiculous. First off, no one in Memphis is obsessed with Elvis; unfortunately most are obsessed with bad garage rock, but I digress. Secondly, that song was one of the most uncomfortable moments ever captured on film. I think I would have been more comfortable having my toe nails ripped out. Not only did it sound like a bad Johnny Cash impersonator, but it was not needed at all, and only served to slow down the already lagging pace. That's really all I'm going to say.

I personally don't like movies which are nothing but the ""tough and hot"" famous guy just shooting tons of people in very unrealistic or impossible with heavy CGI use then saying a ""cool"" line, and bagging the hot chick. Today's movies aim isn't a good plot but more along the lines of good special effects. I was expecting that but I was shocked to see this movie had much more depth than movies of today's time where a good plot means john cena or Jason staythem doing impossible stuff and showing off to tickle the fancy of early teenage angst. This movie had a good storyline which was actually part of the movie and not a guideline nor right in front of your face simple. This movie diverged from typical comic book adaptations which is it being R rated, having a lot of violence and use of the F word, I don't think you could have made this movie this good, without an R rating. It's different because it's more realistic than today's movies in the same genre, where the plot is in this realm of possible and Thomas Jane wasn't being a show boat. They also didn't use CGI as a crutch nor try to woo me with lots of explosions, impossible feats of marksmanship or driving skills or a guy flaunting his body around. Thomas Jane and John Travolta really put forth some great acting in their characters, if you like real action movies (tombstone, Lee Marvin, or a Charles Bronson movie) and not today's action movies such as shoot em up or crank etc, this movie is recommended for you.",The Punisher

A quick plot synopsis: The son of Howard Saint, a powerful drug dealer played by John Travolta, is killed during a drug bust in which Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) was involved. Saint has Frank's family killed, and attempts to have Frank killed. Frank embarks on a quest to get revenge on Saint, his family, and his henchmen. Along the way, he meets a down-trodden waitress with a heart of gold and a pair of lovable misfits.The movie starts off well enough--the chase seen in which Frank's wife and son try to escape Howard Saint's henchman is fantastic. But it's mostly downhill from there. Revenge movies can be a lot of fun, and the best ones even manage to have their characters deal with moral dilemmas. Not so with The Punisher! The morality of Frank's punishment spree isn't ever questioned. Everything is very much black and white--the bad guys are drug dealers and the good guy is a cop. In fact, Frank's alcoholism seems to be a bigger issue than his murderous rampages and wanton destruction of property. I'm not saying that someone with a name like punisher should be all warm and fuzzy, but presenting him as the righteous sword of justice isn't the way to go, either.In addition to providing a bizarre perspective on the morality of revenge, the film is poorly done. The audience is forced to suspend their disbelief beyond acceptable limits. Somehow, the main character survives being shot multiple times at point-blank range and shoved off a pier. Frank seems to have no fear of having his acts of revenge discovered by the police, nor is that ever really an issue. He has a seemingly unlimited supply of cash. It's a standard, 80's-style action flick in which the rules of reality are bent and, at times, utterly broken. The characters have all been done before: the drug lord, the drug-lord's ambitious son, the drug-lord's pampered wife, the downtrodden waitress with a heart of gold, and the lovable, shy misfits.The only fun parts of the movie are the chase scene at the beginning and the Frank's fight with a Russian wrestler towards the end. All in all, the film is just bad enough to disappoint, without being bad enough to be enjoyable.",The Punisher

We're not just talking about the wife and kid from the comic version, we're talking both SIDES of his family, his and his wife's at a family reunion.",The Punisher

Very predictable and very filmy.The worst part for me though, was, the background music. Absolutely cheesy and boring. Didn't suit the film at all. The action sequences were pretty good and over the top in some cases but thats OK. Good Cast and acting. Story could've been a little stronger and unpredictable. would've made it more interesting and may be, added an element of suspense or thrill here and there. i would call it an average action flick and worth a watch if u have some time to kill.",The Punisher

366,foramomentintime,The comic is ten times better.,5,21 April 2004,"The Punisher is a great cult comic that revolves around a death wish type hero who dishes justice in the most violent matter possible. It has a social edge that made sense in terms of the characters depicted in the comic, and the society in which they lived in. The movie unfortunately is neither of those things, and the characters are more cartoonish that the real comic book. Thomas Jane does a decent job as the title character but he basically does nothing to really call himself the Punisher, and he lacks the dark edge that made him menacing. Its not the actors fault, because the script is a one-show pony that rather be campy than serious. John plays the bad guy here, and I don't know why he would take such a role because his character is more of a chump than a heavy. A guy that the comic book Punisher would have took out in two seconds. In the rash of comic book movie being released, it's not among the best, but its not the worse ether. That still belongs to Daredevil.Let's hope they get the character right the next time he's on the screen.",The Punisher

But as a movie it could have been a lot better. The acting was good, its just that there wasn't anything in the movie that made u think about at all. There wasn't any mermoriable scenes or one thing that made u think it really was the Punisher from the comics. IT was way better than the old Punisher movie by far, but i think they could have made this one a lot better than it already was. Maybe a better director could have done it. There was a few bit of cheesy lines and the ending where hes on the bridge was kinda weak i thought. Not as good as Spider Man or the X-Men movies but better than The Hulk and ties with Hell Boy. But overall i give it 7/10.",The Punisher
368,TheHeck,Worst Marvel so far...,3,21 June 2004,"This movie is just flat.The actor playing The Punisher seems to have attended the ""Steven Segal's Acting Academy"" or something. Or maybe it's just the horrible tacky plot. The movie is not dark nor sinister although you do get some shocking moments in the movie that unfortunately seem forced and completely illogical.The girl next door, fatman and metal-mouth? Useless.Travolta's character is much too simple and predictable and lacks of any charisma beyond any of Travolta's efforts.I would definitely recommend the old one. At least Dolph Lundgren knows how to play a mean guy and that is one thing The Punisher should be.The movie has very nice special effects and fight scenes.

The game looked good on the adverts but the film although not that bad, did drag on a bit. The film did deliver a few laughs, which is why it isn't the worse film I've ever seen but it was really long. After a while i was basically waiting for the film to finish. I wouldn't recommend this film to people who have short-attention spam (i do get bored easily). The film might appeal to a lot people, and those who sit through this film without getting bored during any bit of the film, then they deserve my respect.

372,therealmusashi,"This time, the critics were right. Punisher 2004 sucks.",1,26 August 2005,"It's a shame that a comic book with years of great writing can be reduced to this B-movie garbage by people who obviously just don't ""get it."" It's also a shame that Marvel let this happen.I'm a big fan of the comics, and have been since their creation - but this movie was a half-hearted, pathetic attempt to rake in some more cash because of the recent success of other comic-based movies. At least, that's the only reason I can think of that this movie was created and (obviously) rushed to the screen. It certainly wasn't a labor-of-love type film by someone who grew up reading the comics and had been waiting for the right time in his career to produce a faithful adaptation.Other users have said this, but for anyone considering seeing this film: skip it.If you are a comic fan, and MUST see a Punisher-based movie, see the earlier one with Dolph Lundgren. It was a flawed B-movie as well, but at least Lundgren's portrayal of Frank Castle was much more aligned with the character in the comic book. He was a jaded, cynical, emotionless assassin - detached from the ""real"" world, his only solace found in offing criminals. He was never some available guy hanging around an apartment with a bunch of needy losers looking for a relationship. The comic has never been a life-affirming feel-good story with an uplifting ending. It's a jaded look at the seedy underworld, in which Frank Castle is routinely tortured, and anyone who gets close to him eventually gets killed.The Punisher 2004 had a million flaws that caused it to totally suck, but here are my top gripes: - John Travolta. Cheeseball actor, drama queen. He ruined this movie, because you can't take him seriously as an adversary for the *real* Frank Castle.Back story. Why change it? The comic back story is perfectly believable. Making Castle a law-enforcement officer would give the character all these moral dilemmas about wasting every lowlife he comes across.Stupid scenarios - since they changed the back story, they had to change the reason his family gets killed, etc. The villains in this film show up and kill everyone EXCEPT the guy they came to kill. I was reminded of Dr. Evil in Austin Powers in this pathetic attempt to kill him. ""Oh, we'll just leave now and assume everything went off as planned."" They don't even stick around to confirm his death.Very little action - For an ""action"" comic, this turned into to some stupid family drama where Castle ""manipulates"" the bad guys into killing themselves. What!? The Punisher is an assassin. It isn't about the head games, it's about the re-con, the gear, and pulling the trigger.Stupid, wooden supporting actors - The little weaselly guy with the East Coast accent had no business a) in Tampa, b) in this (or any) movie.Travolta's right hand man isn't an intimidating actor and can't carry a scene alone. He sucked in ""The Postman"" and he sucks here. His only believable scene is where he gets killed.""The Russian"" they send to kill Castle in his apartment uses the crafty approach of KNOCKING ON THE DOOR. Of course, Castle, ex-military vigilante, doesn't even look out the peep-hole. Then, you see the Russian, with a bleach-blonde crew-cut, and wearing a red & white striped spandex shirt. Okay. Castle fights Mork on steroids in this scene. Retarded. And several cuts during the fight scene with ""The Russian"" border on self-parody with Castle making all kinds of ""Oops!""-style funny faces. God, why?Travolta's son(s) in the film...pathetic. They could have been played by mannequins.The stereotypical fat Italian guy, skinny computer nerd, and the hot, vulnerable, horny, available girl. Riiiight. Why didn't they throw in a gay black dude with funny sunglasses, just to round things off? For the record, the kid playing the computer nerd is actually a good actor in other films, but his character has no place in this film at all.Location - other readers have said it, I'm saying it again. Florida is full of old people, queers, and illegal aliens. The sandy beach is not where the character of the Italian Frank Castle gets his pathos - it's the dirt and grime of the gritty urban sprawl.Finally, I have to comment on the Johnny Cash/Wayne Newton traveling guitar-bard that shows up and sings a song to Frank Castle about his death. Totally absurd. During this scene, I had a fantasy that Castle pulled out his weapon and shot the guy dead, right in the middle of the song. Now THAT would have been The Punisher I know.If you LIKE The Punisher, avoid this film like The Plague, it will only make you angry.How many Batman films did they screw up before finally getting it right? Maybe that's what it will take here too. They should turn it over to the team responsible for Sin City.",The Punisher
373,evanlu-43779,Plain,6,23 July 2019,"I didn't know this film exists until I saw it on sale in a DVD store, because of the film title, I decided to give it a look since the character appears in Daredevil season 2 as well as its own TV show, and that character is great. This movie incarnation on the other hand, feels plain.The biggest issue I have in this film is core of the Punisher. In original comics and the TV version. Frank's family in the comics were killed during mob crossfires instead of planned homicide. And Frank's motive to become the Punisher is to prevent any other family in the city from the same tragedy that happened to his family by any means necessary, not vengeance. I do understand that any superhero film or action film need a super villain but change what makes the Punisher what he is in my opinion, just doesn't work. What he did in the film makes him even more villainous than the big bad.No film is worthless, so is The Punisher. Even though I hated the whole payback thing, I do enjoy action scenes a lot and his roommates are very likable side characters.",The Punisher

And let me tell you, this... is good. The Punisher brings everything one could want in a movie based on one of the coolest characters ever created. It brings the tragedy of the slaughter of his family, the emotionlessness of the character, a pernicious villain, and of course... gunfights! Tom Jane and John Travolta are very convincing in their roles. They both pull it off so well. I thought the writers did a great job with the story which is rare these days. I especially loved the speech given by Frank Castle before the last battle between him and the criminals. I believe it was taken from ""Punisher War Journal"". Overall, this movie packs a lot of action while having a good story and setting which really bring out the essence of the comics.",The Punisher
376,Mr.NO,The story is not unusual but I found it entertaining,6,11 June 2005,"I've never read the comic nor did I see the former versions of The Punisher. For me, the movie was quite entertaining, maybe just because I like that kind of style. The story is not unusual, a former FBI agent seeks revenge after his whole family are ""executed"" by a mafia organization, he kills them all extravagantly and finally becomes ""The Punisher"".Thomas Jane is though but I've seen better actors in similar roles. The relationship between Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) and Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) looks unnecessary. The fight between Frank Castle and the Russian killer looks is like a comedy scene, which is in much contrast with the general style of the movie.",The Punisher
377,bdjnk,Awful In Every Way Possible,1,16 May 2006,"This movie was a pathetic attempt to make a movie, whose point is still unclear to me. At first glance, the actors, the soundtrack, and above all, the script, are to blame.First, the script:If I wanted to see a movie about tortured soul searching and touching painful moments, I'd have gone to see a psychologist. I was trying to watch a movie about The Punisher. The clever idea of stewing up an improved version of the emotional turmoil and it's effects, is a total failure.The movie is based on a comic. The emotions and their effects are quite clear therein. I bet they thought ""let's make him a bit more human"", or ""we need to create a sympathy for him"", or some such similar rubbish. In the end they created a piece of trash.The dialog was bland and very uninspired. So much so that five minutes after watching it I can't remember a single line. The delivery was similarly bad, ranging from mediocre to seriously pathetic, which bring me to my second point.Second, the actors:Not one of the actors did better then reasonable and most did far worse. A few of the scenes were so badly done; I had to pause the movie to recover my astonishment. A friend even commented: ""At least their not over acting; for that she'd have to know how to act"".Truth is, I can't handle John Travolta. His 'acting' just makes me angry, and that made me generally dislike the acting even more.Last, the good:There was one redeeming fight scene. One part of this movie that was not agonizingly terrible. Also, a few side actors who came through as convincing picked up a bit.Not enough to make it worthwhile to watch. It's too late for me, but all the rest of you be warned. This is one to skip.",The Punisher
378,BatmanMK,Only watch the last 20 minutes.,7,16 April 2004,"(SPOILERS AHEAD)Man, I wanted to love this film. As a comic nut, I REALLY wanted to love it. But it was so flawed. Start off with the locale, why couldn't this film be set in NY? Because it would step on the toes of that other Marvel movie franchise? Tampa was a ridiculous setting. Our hero? Well, Frank Castle is a Vietnam vet and a kick ass cop. Not an undercover fop in dyed blonde hair. That's the basic problem with this version of Frank, he shows way too much mirth. Okay maybe not THAT much, but enough so that when he finally goes full blown Punisher, the effect is lessened. Jane is great, but isn't given the best material to work with. Villain? Travolta phones this in. His lamest/tamest villain yet. And what bad guy smokes a pipe nowadays?? Supporting cast? Ehhh. I loved that they were using Garth Ennis' great ideas and characters. But take them out of NY, and add way too much sentiment, and they lose their appeal. Joan, Bumpo, and Dave(Spacker Dave!), get way too close to Castle , way too fast. Granted it's a plot device, but still. And let's please not forget that Frank announces himself to the police, announces that he's still alive, for NO REASON WHATSOEVER!!!! And then, we never see the cops again! One of the Punishers weapons is his mysteriousness, maybe he's out there, maybe he's not. Maybe someone finally killed him... This part was unforgivable. Will Patton isn't given a lot either, and the sub plot with his sexuality and his possible betrayal adds nothing to the film. The action? Very good. Nothing we haven't seen before, but very good. Garth's Russian makes an appearance, but without the taunting, is just a huge slab of meat. Then there is the Mariachi killer(?) which I demand an explanation for. Talk about a useless character! Anyway, the only thing true to the character is the last 20 or so minutes, when Frank makes his assault on Travolta's lair. Great kill scenes, great explosions. Everything the Punisher is about. Now if only they would cut out most of everything before that. It was loaded with funny lines, some good, some groaners. I hope it makes sequel worthy money, so they can try and get it right next time.",The Punisher
379,X_Series,Satisfying,8,5 November 2006,"The Punisher as an archetype is well represented here, however the transition from victim to vigilante or underwear hero is perhaps not so well portrayed as in Batman Begins. The foibles and faults of a newly-born crime-fighter and novice righter of wrongs is a bit facile and underdone. Perhaps too much attention is paid to Life 'pre-catalysmic-coversion' to 'unstoppable-angel-of-vengeance' and not to the actual process of conversion. Too much is left ""understood"" by the director via silent commiseration with the sole bereaved and his feral and wide-eyed quest for eye-for-an-eye justice.Instead, attention perhaps should have been directed to the universal human need for passionate rectification/punishment/demonstration of intolerance for injustice, the justification/vindication of the angel of justice; reaffirmation that the evil receive swift retribrution commensurate with their crimes. That the living shall never more admire or emulate the righteously eradicated cancers upon our meritorious society. The cheaters will be eradicated and the toiling, humble worker will be exalted. The meek shall inherit the earth. Logic and organization, the vanguard and epitome of life, shall safeguard and advance the cause of the prosperous; the productive, portentious living shall be given free reign and autonomy against the treacherous, vainglorious poachers of control; the warlords, the alpha males, the conscienceless, the dishonorable, the opportunists.The Punisher and his activity represents a fundamental, universal, and uniquely American wish-fulfillment of wrongs invariably righted, of merit justly recognized, and the power of the true believer to single-handedly set things right. In this film, however, the good triumphs seemingly without effort or difficulty, despite contrary conventional wisdom declaring that ""no good deed goes unpunished"". The evil withers, bad-guy bullets (that never hit the good guy--and when bad guys run out of bullets, they throw their guns--thankfully unrepresented in this film) ineffectually flying, straw-man-like defenses futilely attempting to prevent the inevitable satisfaction of the victorious good over the nefarious evil.In this film, the answers are black and white--an anaesthetic allegory of the pure, utopian, idealized, socially-unattainable-yet-individually-irresitable triumph over the entirely evil, irredemably corrupt sociopath. Escapism at its best--the vicarious satisfaction of wrongs righted and injustices redeemed.Unfortunately the unrealistic probability of wrongs righted and injustices corrected via the actions of a single individual, being exceedingly remote, are not explored. Frank Castle, like an ancient Greek hero, is expected to prevail, damn the torpedoes, and don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes. Nevermind the frustratingly common failures of driven people or the disenchanted, pedestrian dismay of all people, hero, everyman, and villain alike facing unovercome obstacles. The Punisher, like Batman, unaided by heavenly or genetic advantages, should legitimately epitomize the victory over obstreporous difficulty ordinary people have to overcome each day, and then some, in order to reach the threshold of superhero I've come to expect from The Punisher from the comics--i.e. he should have superhuman tolerance for beurocratic delays, incredible tolerance for and adaptability to failures from his partners (i.e. Micro, who doesn't appear in the film, but is admirably yet hollowly personified by The Neurotic Cook and the Pathetically Brave Masochist), and finally saintly patience and resolution in the face of obstacles threatening thwartage of his goal. Isee little of this in the actual film, only curiously facile attainment of revenge by proxy from his surprisingly vulnerable foe, the inexplicably inept, underutilized John Travolta.In short, this film results in a surprise win by an unknown in a ""routine"" fight between the well-known-and-disappointingly underplayed Bad Guy (as seen in ""Swordfish,"" ""Battlefield: Earth,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Broken Arrow,"" and others, with untapped potential stemming from the comic storyline to be the Kingpin) with the predictable result of the Good Guy(tm) winning the day. It does not explore the gray zone Frank Castle inhabits between good and evil, or the problematic conflicts with the law that Castle regularly has to deal with in everyday life. However, it is fun and entertaining. Overall, 6.5/10",The Punisher
380,gzillah,One of my favorites,10,28 March 2008,"Im a big fan of both Thomas Jane and John Travolta. In almost every movie Tom Jane is in, he always plays kind of like the tough guy/hero of the movie. And he certainly does in this too! SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle, an undercover cop who has just retired. On his last job, Frank killed a man named Robert Saint, the son of Howard Saint, played by John Travolta. Howard Saint gets angry, and sends his hit men to kill Frank Castle and his entire family. While Castle, his wife and son, and his family are at a family reunion in Puerto Rico, his whole family gets killed, even his wife and son. Frank Castle is left for dead, but returns with a desire for revenge. Only, he does not call it revenge-but PUNISHMENT. This is when the movie starts to get insane. Frank Castle/The Punisher starts to kill everybody, eventually John Travolta.This is really of my favorite films. It's weird, because even though this is a superhero movie, The Punisher has no super-powers. But thats OK. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys action films.

381,mikegamer,Makes Good Use of the Source Material,7,3 April 2008,"When ""The Punisher"" was first released in 2004, it was critically panned for being inferior to ""Kill Bill Vol. 2,"" which was released around the same time. But as a comic book adaptation and as a film, Hensleigh's ""The Punisher"" really delivers.First of all, I cannot stress how perfect the casting of Thomas Jane was. He absolutely looks the part, no acting needed. Jane's moody, brooding performance only adds to the effect, creating a convincing character that feels grounded in reality, while still maintaining a slight ""over the top"" feel (mainly in some of the dialog). He walks a thin line, but he walks it well, managing to inject slight humor into some parts of the film (""I'm fine. He's not."") while still maintaining the serious tone of the film.While it may be a comic book film, it is not for children. ""The Punisher"" is rated R for pervasive graphic violence, but all of it serves the story and is somewhat referential of 80's action flicks...before the onset of CGI. Carlo Siliotto, the composer, does a marvelous job, and though relatively unknown in the states, manages to craft a memorable score with a lot of personality. As for the camera work, it's intentionally reminiscent of some of Sergio Leone's work, which Hensleigh has quoted as an influence of his.""The Punisher"" is not for everyone (there is a rather intense torture scene, multiple shootings, and the death of at least one child), but for those willing to give it a chance, I don't think they'll be disappointed.",The Punisher
382,shaft226,Its alright but tried too much to become mainstream,5,27 August 2008,"In retrospect the movie is decent but there were some mistakes throughout the picture. The Punisher is based in NY not Tampa; Since when Tampa, FL has become the crime capital of the world? The only thing to worry about in Tampa is crazy ass Floridan drivers. Frank Castle didn't have an extended family ie Aunts, Uncles, Father etc. He just had his wife and little children. The skull on a tee-shirt is not a good luck charm as the movie points out, The explanation for that was lame. He wasn't a FBI agent, he was a NY Cop. Punisher was a loner by nature, that means he wasn't trying to start a surrogate family with his neighbors like in the movie. It took the movie too long for Castle to transform into the punisher and with the action a hell of a lot less than in the comics. Don't get me started on the fire punisher symbol at the end of the movie. It was cheesy and there was no place for it. It is my hope the new punisher movie does the character some justice.",The Punisher
383,expiremedia,"Punishment. Honestly, it's punishment.",4,30 April 2004,"Taken's Review: The Punisher***~~~____~~~*** Spoilers Herein ***~~~____~~~***I must say, I was greatly disappointed with this film. I left the theater saying, ""Why?"". It tried to be something that it just couldn't.Instead of writing a traditional review, here is a list of cons and pros.Why The Punsiher is a genuinely bad film:1. Terrible writing/dialogue The film contains some of the most poorly written dialogue I have ever heard. Example: The scene where Saint's wife says something like ""I asked you to avenge our sons death, and you did."" The line is horribly written and unnecessary. Many more of the lines of dialogue just as bad are contained within.2. Terrible Editing Simply put, it was all over the place. ""Cuts"" in the worst places, scenes put in ridiculous places, ""Fades"" where only a dissolve would make sense. The list goes on. I wouldn't allow the editors to touch a children's film.3. Poor Directing The list is too long. Look what he allowed.4. Unnecessary Character The fat guy (Bumpo) was only put into the film so the writer could attempt to show his own comedic talents. The character had no purpose and often became a point of hatred.5. Writer inserting annoying clever quips This just got disgusting after the first. I was seriously saying ""Oh, Come On!"" outloud in the theater. Many around me agreed. Example:Joan: Where will you be? The Punisher: You'll know, read your paper every morning.Joan: Which section? The Punisher: The obituaries.Yes, these are clever, but over-used and lame.6. Big Contradiction Castle complains about how the one villain is a sadist. What the [expletive] is the punisher? A SADIST!! Example: Knife through bottom of chin, tying Saint to the car causing him to be dragged through a maze of exploding vehicles.7. Unnesessary use of ""Punisher Icon"" The punisher icon that appeared near the end (the fire from the burning cars) was entirely pointless. More significance should have been placed on how the icon is part of ""The Punisher"" (He should have left the symbol at every killing). Just because the shirt came from Castle's son is simply not enough.8. Minor Errors Castle's son breaks his arm in car crash (he complains about arm pain), yet 10 seconds later, he's pounding on the door of a beach-shack, with both arms, showing no pain.Within about 2 seconds the ""bad guys"" were about to steal a truck that presumably was the property of a member of the Castle family. Hmmmm....2 seconds.How the [expletive] many times was Castle shot? 20? 30? Yet no pain, no major injuries. It gives ""abs of steel"" a new meaning.The ""bad guys"", or Saint's Posse (as I like to call them), would have been smart enough to round up all of the people, take them into the shack and shoot them on-by-one. Actual ""dirty dealers"" would be smart enough to do that as to not get the attention of a passerby. Also, shooting them one-by-one would cause more emotional pain to Castle and the family members awaiting death, which would be a plus for Saint.Here are the positive aspects:1. The character ""Dave"" was highly believeable. The actor did an outstanding job of gaining sympathy.2. Mildly comical scenes. Example: Money being thrown out the window, people going crazy over it. Quite funny. _______________________________________________________________________My Rating....

384,Neon_Man,Another great Punisher movie,10,18 August 2009,This is by far the best Punisher movie made. Tom Jane is the Punisher in every way possible he really shows why Frank becomes to the Punisher and how much losing his family hurt him he has a reason for being the Punisher and as the movie goes on you see him become more and more brutal in his killings had there been a sequel it would have been total mayhem.The plot is a great revenge story with meaning something not seen since DeathWish with great acting from everyone and some of the best fight scenes out of any Punisher movie.If you are a Punisher fan you will love this otherwise your no fan.,The Punisher
385,bafflewit,Frankenstein /Josey Wales Parallels,10,6 April 2005,"Was watching this film for about the fortieth time and was hit with the realization of just how many references to these two classic movies this film contained. Frank Castle is basically an interpretation of the monster, created by Dr Frankenstein (Howard Saint) and determined to kill his creator. The most striking reference is after Quentin Glass has tortured Dave and Castle emerges form the elevator while lightning and thunder go off in the background, echoing the creation of the monster in the first film. As far as the Josey Wales thing, both men had their families wiped out and became one man hit squads who, accidentally, become figureheads in makeshift families of outcasts. All three are must see cinema, in my humble opinion.",The Punisher
386,ajn04,As long as you expectations are right this is a GREAT MOVIE,5,9 September 2004,The movie is overall good. Tom Jane is not only a sweat candy for an eye but also a decent actor. As long as you watch the movie with certain appropriate expectations (action flick) I think that you will enjoy it. The idea of justified punishing of a scum of the world is a very enticing one. The main character in the movie is a CIA agent serving our country as a undercover agent. During one of the operations he is involved in killing of a son of the criminal underworld king. Subsequently our main character's entire family gets brutally killed. To come to peace with the reality he goes on a punishing (for everyone involved in the killing) mission. Don't we all wish for THE PUNISHER to bring a justice to this world?,The Punisher
387,cujorocks31,THE PUNISHER IS A DARKER SIDE OF MARVEL,7,23 April 2004,"Do you know Spiderman? The guy, who wears a red and blue costume, swings around and crawls on walls? Well if he ever met the punisher he would probably swing away with a wet spot in between his legs. Tom Jane is the punisher, a Anti Hero who wants to make everyone who ruined his life suffer in the most extreme ways, He doesn't care if he dies because Frank Castle is already dead. Only The Punisher remains after the horrible tragedy that happens to Frank and his family, his whole family. Who is behind the slaughter? Howard Saint (John Travolta). Castle has just finished his last job as an undercover FBI agent. Unfortunately Saint's son is killed during the job, Saint and his wife are furious and they order tough guy Quentin glass and his buddies to kill Castle, and his family. Frank and his family are having a family reunion in Puerto Rico and everyone is murdered. Roy Schneider plays a very likeable character in a short but memorable role as Frank's heroic father. Frank's wife and son manage to escape but Quinton and the others hunt them down. Castle gets to his wife and son as fast as he can but it isn't fast enough and the audience begins to know it is to late when Castle shouts out `Maria' to a pair of bodies on a dock. He reaches them and starts to stumble drunkenly because he has found out that, as he suspected (and we knew), the bodies are his Wife Maria and his son Will. When the dust is settled Castle should be dead but he isn't however he is dead on some degree because without his wonderful family he no longer has anything to live for. Frank dedicates his life to completely destroying Saint's in almost every way both emotionally and physically. Castle gets some help from some of his new neighbors (social outcasts who have always been misunderstood). It is very appealing to watch Saint's empire slowly crumble into bits and pieces at his feet. A very intriguing character is Saint's second son, he is hard to figure out sometimes but by the time the film is over we know what he is really like. The acting is excellent. All the supporting characters both bad and good are very memorable. Travolta is surprisingly convincing as Saint and Tom Jane seems born for the Film's title role. The dialogue is pretty good, and the action is dark and intense. Some scenes are very memorable. I loved this film because of the way it differs from other films of its genre. I loved how Castle became swallowed up by the dark and spit back out as a man on an automatic revenge mission. Oh wait; it's not revenge, its punishment. Movies like this are bound to get bad reviews but don't let critics stop you, chances are if you want to see this movie then you will like it. If not then chances are you won't enjoy it. Me, I really liked The Punisher and it's dark atmosphere.",The Punisher
388,alderichaimes,"Where to start? How about, terrible.",3,16 April 2004,"Alright, I realize that I'm a tough film critic and also an old-school punisher fan going on 15 years strong, but I tried to go into this film with an open mind and a little hope. It only took about 2 min. 30 sec. of this film before my hopes were dashed. OK, where to start?First off, I'm not going to do one of these, ""His family wasn't killed like that, they were killed like this"" or ""But in the comics his wife's name was (name) not (wrong name)"", because that would be a waste of my time and yours. For the fans, you can spot all the disparities right away (although they did get his wife's name right), and for just the one's who want to enjoy a good film, you'll never know the difference. So on to the meat.
Writing. The story doesn't stand on it's own. No good hook in the beginning, dry melodramatic sequences through the middle, and an unsatisfying end. Typical plot, typical characters, typical motive. Just didn't do it for me. Next, Directing. The directing wasn't too bad except for some prolonged dramatic close-ups, especially with T. Jane. The action sequences were done pretty well and everything else was average. Editing. Now this is a tough one because this is one of those movies where you're not sure if the writers gave the editors a hard job or the editors did a bad job with the writing. I say, if all else fails blame the director, so ""Bad Director!"". Cinematography. Bland, boring, blah. Acting (please shoot me). If Travolta plays one more unconvincing, unemotional villain please send me to an early grave. But all the fault can't lay entirely on his shoulders because, well, the rest of the cast can't act either. Jane had the physique and the facial features for Castle but he just couldn't act the part. Not even close. And Castle's neighbors (which got a good portion of the script, God knows why) were also unconvincing, over-acted, and at the same time bland. Not a one of them gave a performance that stuck out. The only guy I like through the whole thing was ""Mickey"" whose real name I can't remember right now but who you might remember as the electronics expert from the Soderberg's remake of Ocean's Eleven.Over all I'd say, don't see it in the theater and waste your hard earned money on a movie you may feel compelled to walk out on half way through. Rent it went it comes out on DVD. And if you're a fan, and absolutely must see it in the theater, bring a friend to help laugh at all the humorously embaressing moments when you feel bad for anyone who knew they were involved with the production of this film. Oh, well. Maybe third time will be a charm.",The Punisher
389,michaelkohut,Better than the 1989 Shlockfest,10,16 April 2004,"They couldnt have chosen a better man to play 'The Punisher'. John Travolta,as a bad guy,flawless. Though i cant help but think that this is still not 100% accurate to the comic its based on. First off,Castle's wife and kid(s) were killed in the series,and i believe it was in NYC,not Florida. Aside from those few flaws,this is a great adaptation,moreover,Kevin Nash's part as 'the russian' is superb. He appears very built in the movie,mustve worked hard to gain that physique for the film. All in all,a great movie,a must see,imho. What else CAN i say about it,really? Great execution of what was always supposed to be a mature comic,which got far off track,but after several restarts,it is as great as this movie is. The comic and the movie,combine together,to make one cohesive unit,and now all we must do is try to forget the whole dolph lundgren taking on the yakuza movie of 1989......",The Punisher
390,michaelkohut,"To hell with the 'reviewers' they know crap,they would rather rate a piece of tripe like Kill Bill Vol.2 a 'must-see' and rate this movie with a 'thumbs-down' when both have violence in them. Hollywood STILL",10,19 April 2004,"I went into this movie,thinking about the 1989 piece of garbage that was passed off as 'The Punisher'. Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher,with a whino bum for an informant,who he feeds booze? wtf was THAT crap? Moreover,he goes after the Yakuza in the film. Im sure in one Punisher comic or another he HAS gone after them,but I wouldve thought that the movie adaptation would be close to the comic. Frank Castle was a NYC cop,though i believe this part they got right. Even in the new movie,its not 100% accurate,though some things can be overlooked as this re make or re start wipes the slate clean of the former debacle called a movie. No sign of a booze chugging bum in this one,nor any of the other garbage,namely dolph lundgren. Thomas Jane plays a great part in the movie,as does John Travolta,who should have been in more movies as villains. One of the men who played a villian in 'the crow' was in the movie too i believe,playing a small side role. Anyone who has seen that movie as much as i have will know who he is,which one. The guy who played 'skank' in the crow. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is also in a supporting role in the movie,another great performance in my opinion. Anyway,like alot of others on here have said,IGNORE THE MORONS who think they are professional 'critics' and judge for yourself. Is this movie tripe? Or is it Filet Mignon? Or something in between. But as ive said before,comparing this to the old punisher movie,there IS no comparing them. This is the FAR superior movie,PERIOD. GO SEE IT and knock 'kill bill' out of that top spot.......",The Punisher
391,adam262,GOOD MOVIE,8,17 April 2004,the reviews have been mistakably bad for this movie.  If you like good action movies this is one to see. I voted it a 10.  John Travolta was at his best in the movie.  The only time i actually liked Travolta as a villain. Thomas Jane finally got a break starring in a good movie.  He played the part excellent.  And i was a fan of The Punisher comics.  And Thomas Jane nailed the role of the Punisher.  And its a realisitc flim in that he actually gets shot and isnt like a superhero because hes not at all.  And it also has one of the best fight scenes of all time when he takes on the Russian played by Kevin Nash.  So if you are wondering if you should go spend four bucks on the movie.  Do it. Its an excellent film.  And should have gotten better reviews from the critics than it did!  I am already looking forward to seeing the sequel if they make one.,The Punisher
392,patrick-292,This movie is a bomb.,1,3 December 2004,"Not much to say here. For all the emotion Jane was able to display at the loss of his entire family, he might have been mistaken for a labotomy recipient. He seems more upset with police for not chasing down the zero leads they were given for a crime in another country. Just dumb.As a side note...The Punisher is not a good-guy. The directors may have wanted to make a point (maybe through the Police Captain or Newscasters) that vigilante-ism is criminal. By not recognizing this massive social flaw at some point in the movie doesn't say much good about anybody else. This guy is made out as some sort of hero, but he's still a murderer like the other bad-guys....former cop or no.",The Punisher
393,fabio_belas,There wasn't a Punisher... Why?,1,8 August 2005,"I'm really sorry, but what's this movie about? All I know is that they had the easiest character from the marvel comics universe, to make a movie, and they just didn't hit the spot.Come on! The Punisher is, first of all, a SERIOUS character. WHY HE WASN'T SERIOUS IN THE MOVIE? He's not a funny one. Not for children.It was all wrong. I know that those who like this movie, don't know the character so well. For them, the movie was good. But for us, those who knows what the punisher is all about, it was the worst adaptation based on a comic book.I still don't believe it. THE EASIEST ONE, THE WORST MOVIE.

394,CatooProductionsVC,A Wasted Opportunity: Boring And Shallow,3,21 February 2015,"This entire film feels like a two-hour trailer for sequels that were never made. It also feels like not much happens in the space of two hours. In fact, Frank Castle is not identified as The Punisher until the last five seconds of the film. It's yet another superhero flick which spends way too much time on the origin story, and, might I add, the so-called 'punisher' doesn't even punish people. We don't get to see executions, shoot-outs, or anything. And there's this stupid sequence where Frank Castle and The Russian are fighting while this music plays. And the film isn't even that violent. It's just so bland and forgettable and it feels like a trailer for sequels which were never produced...for a good reason. There's a few things I like about this film, though. The fight choreography is well-done, I think the film is as dark as it should be, despite what others have said, and I also think Thomas Jane does a good job as Frank Castle. But everything else is just so bland, dull and pointless.The 1989 film is far superior in my opinion...",The Punisher
395,jules_winfield94,"Action packed, violent and oddly moving revenge/comic book movie",7,20 March 2005,"The Punisher is filled to the brim with gruesome violence and gritty action. But at the same time (and this is what surprised me about the movie the most) it is a very moving and tragic piece of film. You can't help but sympathize with Castle, the most compelling anti-hero to light up the silver screen in a very long time. Tom Jane plays The Punisher with conviction and grace. We as an audience know that his actions are extreme, yet we can't help but root for him. Jane also has a rugged look to him reminiscent of older action heroes. It benefits the movie's tone, because this is essentially a throw back to old school action movie, specifically westerns, revenge films and vigilante picks like the. The film was bashed quite badly for it's sadistic violence. I for one find nothing off putting about any of it. The violence is used to further the story, specifically the Castle family massacre and the sub-plot involving the villain (John Travolta with his stern face and menacing glares) and his wife and concillierie. Yes the violence is all very hard hitting,shocking and gory but the movie calls for it. I for one welcome it. They don't call him The Punisher for nothing. Give this movie a chance.

For a start, it is very similar to the comic interpretation of the character, and that is the most important thing for a comic book film.The film also rocks because Castle kills everyone who deserves it. It is a proper revenge film.Good casting with Tom Jane playing Frank Castle and good old Travolta as Howard Saint.Mint.",The Punisher
397,jipokowalski,Down And Dirty,8,14 January 2007,"Just to give you some frame of reference for what you are foolishly about to read: 1. I am a huge fan of comics and 2. I am a huge fan of action movies I realise that these two facts will dishearten anyone who has any actual taste when it comes to movies but if you'll bare with me I'll try to explain my reason for giving such a poorly regarded film a big dirty 8.0 rating.First off, with regard to comics, I am an avid reader and fan of a variety of comics including those of Garth Ennis who has recently rebooted The Punisher as an adult title for Marvel and happens to hail from just up the road in good old Ireland. While I have only read a few of Mr Ennis' Punisher comics I am familiar with his very highly regarded Preacher series and as such I am accustomed to both his rampantly violent style and his off kilter sense of humour. I am not, however, a sad little comic book nerd who cries tears of blood because they change a comic in adapting it. As such The Punisher is a triumph of adaptation and bodes very well for more off the wall comic adaptations in future. Ennis' style is funny, fairly sick, constantly violent, brutally honest and always entertaining. The film loses some of the subtleties (and gains John ""Look at my head"" Travolta) of a long drawn-out comic series but it nails the tone of Ennis' sick world. This, as is obvious from what I've read, hasn't sat very well with some viewers who were expecting more of a straight down the line action film. Well sod them, straight down the line action films are boring and ten a penny these days, I appreciate the curveball.Now, with regard to my obsession with ""The Action Movie"", I loved Hensleigh's efforts here. No computer generated nonsense, no shoehorned in romantic subplot and no watered down politically correct hero. The Punisher is an old school action film. The camera does not detach itself from reality in order to follow th path of a bullet or any other such matrix inspired twaddle. We just get good old fashioned shoot outs, car chases and fist fights. I have since learned that this is, in part, because of a limited budget but I loved the small (ish) scale of the action and the focus on smaller showdowns rather than all out warfare. I was reminded of directors like Peter Yates, John Sturges, Sergio Leone, Don Siegel and Robert Aldrich, the people who invented the action film before musclehead Hollywood of the eighties and nineties hijacked it.In short, despite the presence of John Travolta's head and some other niggles, I loved The Punisher because it combined something old (and rarely practiced these days) with something new (and strange) to make something original.",The Punisher
398,NerdLife,"Action packed, dark story that keeps you interested.",8,12 October 2007,"I like this movie because I am nothing more than a man wearing a suit to cover up the little boy inside. He's The Punisher, he fights bad guys, and he blows stuff up. That's my kind of movie.For all of its merits (did I mention that he blows stuff up), The Punisher does have its problems. Let's start with our bad guy. I really like John Travolta, and this is one of his most understated, yet stronger performances. However, writer/director John Hensleigh needs to make him a better nemesis for The Punisher. Saint comes off too much like a small time hood instead of the imposing man who can order the elimination of a family. Travolta seems to be aching for a chance to be darker, meaner, nastier, and Hensleigh should have found a way to do it.Also, I was put off by the comic relief and love story. Most of the ""laughs"" are supposed to come from Castle's interactions and growing familiarity with other outcasts who live in his apartment building on the wrong side of town (his new ""family"", yuck), and we have to watch the hint of a love story when The Punisher wins Jane's heart (Rebecca Romijn, no more Romijn-Stamos now that divorce is looming). Of course, she's the tough luck gal down the hall who happens to look like a supermodel because all cruddy apartments are full of supermodels.All of this might be in the comic book and graphic novel, but Hensleigh detaches us from The Punisher and the drama surrounding his cause by including less dramatic stuff, and he doesn't help with constant music that fails to capture the moment as well as inserting increasingly comic book-like fights between The Punisher and Saint's assassins. All of that takes us out of the movie and makes us remember that none of this is real (the fight with Harry Heck is awesome, the one with the Russian, not so much).What do I like about The Punisher? He's a cool good guy. The Punisher does what most of us would wish we could do if we were the victim of such a horrible crime, but Jane is too buff for a guy who drinks away his pain as much as Castle. Maybe I need to try that Wild Turkey diet because he is ripped much more than you have ever seen him in previous movies. I liked Travolta, and wish he could have had more to do. Finally, I like the general plot where Castle increasingly pursues and hurts Saint. His attacks grow more and more menacing as Hensleigh puts them together in a sequence that never makes us feel bad about rooting for Castle because he doesn't lose moral authority.The Punisher needs some improvements, but it's an action packed, dark story that keeps you interested.",The Punisher

The Punisher has got to be one of the harder comic book stories to translate to the big screen format.Its world is very modern-day/non-superhero, but has this outlandish, slightly(?) psycho character living and starring in it.  In any other Hollywood flick, this character would be the bad guy! (..and a quality one!)  In this movie, we like him.  (Look at the last Punisher movie to see how easy it is to go wrong with this formula.)   The 2004 Punisher is a good quality action flick...no doubt.Go see it.As a footnote, I felt Marvel/the producers/whoever treated this movie the same way The Hulk felt to me...

They are not real life characters. I get that. Disbelief, however, is too difficult for me to suspend when a mere mortal such as Frank Castle, is shot in the sternum at point blank range and survives without so much as visiting a doctor. This is just one example of how this movie makes no sense whatsoever. Thomas Jane did a great job in ""61*."" John Travolta usually does a great job as either a hero or villain but this thing was just awful. I mean no disrespect to any of you true fans out there . . .

404,the_two_miracles,Basic Action Flick,4,9 April 2007,"Many speak of The Punisher in the context of it being a comic book adaptation movie. Naturally, this is fair enough. But, to judge The Punisher solely as a movie, regardless of its origins, personally one can't help but feel that here we have a rather basic, plodding action movie, of the sort we might have seen in the 1980s, albeit without the so-called smart one-liners. Removing the movie from the context of it's comic book background, we are presented with a very unadorned and predictable story, with next to nothing in the way of character development. We have no interesting plot twists, no engaging or imaginative ways in which the movie's key themes - revenge and retribution - are sought or confronted, and really very little to sustain us until the movie finally reaches it's (never-in-doubt) conclusion. Jane's performance is solid, but that's the best you can expect him to bring to a character who never verbalizes the anger and bitterness within. Travolta puts in the same performance he always does when playing a villain, right up to the same usual dubious hairline.The Punisher is one for the fans, and good for them: no-one begrudges them this film.

It ended.The list of bad things would be nigh-impossible to list, due to the sheer number, however I will try to highlight some of them:1.  Dialog.  Badly written.  Badly delivered.  Bad, bad, bad.2.  Acting.  Particularly Travolta.  The only reason to respect Travolta is because he's a pilot and has his own jet airliner.3.  Gay-bashing.  Since when is it cool to blackmail someone because they're gay?4.  Unbelievable amounts of suspension of disbelief.  Frank Castle seems to have healing ability on par with Wolverine.  Bullets can't stop him!  He gets shot about a bazillion times in the beginning of the movie, and a while later (no more than 5 months), he's fully healed and ready to kick butt.5.  At one point, the lackey character is selling out his boss (Saint), and has to tell him a lie.  The actor delivers those lines so woodenly, that if I were Saint, I would have never believed him.6.  The cars.  At one point, there's dueling early 70's cars.  Why would both the protagonist and the hitman from Memphis both be driving vehicles like that.7.  The singing hitman (from Memphis).  Oh for God's sake!  Come on!8.  Location Location Location.  Saint is in Tampa and is working with the Cubans.  Last time I checked, Tampa wasn't the hotbed of super-criminal activity.9.

409,its_marmy,Riveting,10,6 November 2006,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Of course, any day that John Travolta dies in a movie is a good day for me. However, the character of The Punisher itself was fascinating. The one thing that bothered me about the movie itself was the fact that during all of his ""judgement sprees"" the police were nowhere to be found. You didn't even hear a siren in the distance. Other than that, the movie kept me glued to the TV enough to want to mute the commercials instead of leaving the room as I normally do. Enough twists and turns to keep it interesting. As always, John Travolta was a convincing criminal and it was nice to see the supporting roles filled by some lesser known (at least for me) actors and actresses. Tom Jane was as steely as he needed to be as Frank Castle and did well in presenting a larger than life Punisher. Needless to say, I really liked it.",The Punisher
410,B-Dizzle,awesome awesome awesome movie,10,3 August 2008,"Right you are! I love this movie and feel it should be classified with Spidey, Ironman and the Hulk as being the best of the marvel films. The only thing i think they should have done was make the murders of his family more brutal. I think it would have fueled his rage even more. Warzone should't be a redo. That implies the first one wasn't done right, which is so far from the truth. It deserves much higher than its overall rating. Thomas Jane was an awesome Frank Castle. Why would anyone say the 1989 movie was better? If i made a top 10 list it would be on it. I just thought it was awesome. I don't even think i'll watch warzone. Without Thomas Jane, I just don't know.",The Punisher
411,Luis_Wipe811,A Good Comic Book Adaptation,7,14 January 2009,"Thomas Jane was an incredible actor like Frank Castle (I think he would be perfect for Max Payne instead of Mark Walhberg)he really was in his character like a few actors.Jhon Travolta acted OK, Its not his best but he does have a good acting as Howard Saint. Probably the most violent film based in a Marvel comic, The punisher gives us a good time talking about action, good car stunts, some good looking shootouts and a lot of explotions in the end.However, some actors were not so good, the script of the movie is not really like it is in the comics but its a good adaption anyway. So, the punisher is a hero but i didn't see any act of heroism, its more like a vengeance movie per say. And for other part, the end is kind predictable and of course, as I said before, I really expected more from Jhon Travolta, He didn't make his best, I don't know why.Conclusion: Its a good adaptation to the character from Marvel Comics. It is not quite a glowing recommendation but this film sure deserves some respect for a very good acting, coming from some actors and also a very good script based on the comic.Rent It some day.",The Punisher
412,Master_Obsidious,"Worth seeing, even if you don't like comics",9,17 April 2004,"First off, I want to say that I am a huge fan of The Punisher.  I have waited for this movie to be released since 2000, when I first heard a rumor that they were going to re-make it.  The original left a very sour taste in my mouth.  With the new slew of quality comic book adaptations hitting the screen, it only seemed natural that The Punisher would get one as well.  So, I've been in anticipation for a while.This was a decent film.  It wasn't as great as I had anticipated, but then I've been waiting for four years to see this so its hard to imagine what would have lived up to that hype.  In any event, then film is worth seeing, and I suspect that it will have a wide appeal, not just to fans of the character.From start to finish, the movie is a strait up action flick, in the tradition of great actions movies of the seventies and eighties.  It feels like a gritty, violent revenge piece that you would have never expected to see on the big screen.  Frank's trademark skull is worked into the movie so easily that it wouldn't have been out of place in another movie.  With the exception of one fight (which I'll talk about in the minute) the violence is real and brutal.  There is no flying or walking through walls or regeneration.  Frank is a human being, though a very dangerous one pushed to the edge by a dangerous (and foolish) man.This isn't to say there weren't bad parts of the film.  For one, while there was plenty of violence in the movie, there still wasn't quite enough of it.  I got the impression that this was to make room for Frank's back-story, and to establish how much work and planning he puts into a single mission (which is one of the most amazing parts of the character). This is a minor complaint.  What ISN'T a minor complaint is the score: its awful.  The music isn't bad, it's just inappropriate.  It was pretty clear that the producers were going for the feel of a revenge western with several parts of the movie, and they must have told Siliotto that.  Sadly, he goes overboard with it.  The score comes across and heavy handed and cheesy, and threatens to undermine otherwise powerful and tastefully done scenes.Two things that this movie had going for it that no other revenge movie has successfully accomplished: satisfaction and believability.  First, the violence in this film is SATISFYING.  Castle's family is brutally murdered for something that Frank really didn't do, and it is committed and condoned by Saint's men and family.  This isn't really a spoiler here: Frank kills all of them.  You know that is what he's going to do.  He COULD have just marched in with a bunch of guns and explosives and killed them all with ease, but that isn't enough.  He PUNISHES the Saints, and it's spectacular. When bones break, when knife enter flesh, when bullets tear through skulls, we feel some manner of elation because these people deserve it.  It is difficult for a movie to create a set of villains so vile and reprehensible that we enjoy their death, while at the same time making them seem human enough to believe.  This movie accomplishes that.
There is one exception to all this: the fight with The Russian.  In the comics, the Russian talks and it's one of the most enjoyable parts of his character.  In the movie, he doesn't.  However, he does give facial expressions and pantomimes that convey that same sense of `I'm enjoying this, you putz.stab me again'.  The Russian is the only character in the movie that could really be called super-human, as he takes punishment that no mortal human ever could.  But, he's funny.  The fight is, more than anything else, very very funny.That's another thing worth pointing out: this is a funny movie.  It genuinely amusing, with good gags and excellent comedy acting.  Frank really doesn't have any humerous lines, but just about every character gets in at least one joke.  Look for Glass' (Will Patton) to say something hilarious to Duka near the beginning of the film.  Even Saint (Travolta) gets a good line in there at one point (`.you have entirely too much furniture!').  When you are rooting for Frank during the violence, you will be laughing.  Most revenge flicks can't pull this off.  This one does.As for the acting: many people complained that Jane wouldn't be right for the role: that he didn't look like the character because of his slight build and blond hair.  Say what you will about the film, you are entitled to not enjoy it, but by God Thomas Jane was The Punisher.  There is no doubt that he captured the emotions, the strength, and the look of the character. Anyone who says otherwise has been reading a different comic book.  Patton is spectacular in his role as well, as he usually is.  Unfortunately, Travolta is.Travolta.  He is barely in the movie, and even when he is he's still barely there.  He approaches every scene with that `frozen-upper-lip' look that he gives to characters that are supposed to be evil.  He was never able to convince me that he was angry; he was never able to convince me that he was steady enough to have built the criminal empire that Frank destroyed in the film.  He comes across as an angry version of his weatherman character in Lucky Numbers, a schmoozer whose coasted on good looks and artificial charm this far and is seeing his haphazardly lane plans unravel around him.  He doesn't even die convincingly, but all this just makes it more satisfying when Frank kills him.  Still, I would have liked to see a better performance out of Travolta, or maybe a better actor in the role.
Every other character is enjoyable, and there are stellar performances here by John Pinette and Mark Collie.  Samantha Mathis is wonderful as Frank's wife.  She is brave, beautiful and strong.making it easy to understand why Frank loves her.  Eddie Jemison plays the role he was born to play: a greasy slimeball in it for himself.albeit a sympathetic one.  Ben Foster is the funniest character in the movie, and we totally buy that he's a reject from the mainstream.  He also has the distinct honor of delivering one of the funniest lines in the movie.  I won't tell you what it is, but its set up when someone asks him `You haven't been doing any drugs, have you?'. Larra Harring is just beautiful; anytime she is on the screen it's hard to notice anyone else.  Her character takes the breath away of everyone in the room, and it makes Saint's obsession with her (and fiendish jealousy) realistic and understandable.  She is also evil: cold, calculating, but deceptive evil.  She's as bad as Saint, she just hides it better.  Her death is of particular enjoyment, though it spurs a predictable and rather trite dialog between Saint and his only living son.  Still, you take the good with the bad.  Romijn-Stamos is disappointing as Joan, but she's not in the film much and her character is balanced out by the performances of Pinette and Foster.
All in all, this was a great comic book adaptation that mostly didn't feel like a comic book adaptation.  It feels like a western and a crime/action flick rolled up into one with a strong central character.  We feel nothing but sympathy for Frank, nothing but hatred for his enemies, and nothing but delight when they get what's coming to them.  Frank makes it clear that he's not out for revenge; he's in it for the punishment.  And he'll be back for more.

413,icarus_a_d,#1 Action Film of the year.WATCH IT OR DIE!,10,12 June 2004,"The Punisher is a very damn good action movie.The fast-paced action scene, with very good plot delivers a stunning & ultimate movie experience to me, personally.The score to this great comic-book-to-movie adaptation is the most brilliant work i've ever heard for an action movie nowadays.It follows from sequence to sequence very perfectly especially the opening score that was very melancholic feel.The movie goes along steadily fast with pure pedal-to-the-metal action without that so-called CGI F/X. All the cast played very well, & very convincing. The script was well written. The Punisher is a very enjoyable movie to watch. After i watch it, i felt very, very SATISFIED.

414,ptolomy9,Just a quick one,7,16 September 2018,"Of the comic book movies, this is actually one of my favorites. A great revenge movie. Coupling some humor with the savagery of the plot was a plus. The down sides were the obvious Hollywood six pack ab shots(for the young ladies) and the dumb punisher logo with the cars aflame at the end as if he was an engineer or genius artist. Some other issues, but not enough to mention. An enjoyable movie but missed greatness because of a need to appeal to an immature audience instead of believability. Yes, it's based on a comic book. I get that. I did give it a 7. If it were made for adults, I would've given it at least a 9. We were all kids onceStill a fun movie to watch.",The Punisher
415,StarTiger,Justice Vs. Revenge,9,18 September 2005,"Here's a question about the story in the movie ""The Punisher"". My Girl friend and I were talking and we have a 2 different views. I agreed with Castle that in a lot of situations the law is inadequate and when those situations rise people have to fall back on natural justice, taking the law into your own hands. I mean what if Castle just found who murdered his family and went to the authorities. But think about the system. Howard Saints would get arrested, make bail, and have enough lawyers and connections to get off on technicalities or make witnesses and evidence disappear. Now is that justice. So you gotta ask yourself,what would you do? I feel Castle was just and if he got caught for it he would probably get locked up when he really deserves a medal.So what do you think? Was Castle excessive and unethical with his personal war? Or is he a hero serving a wholesome plate of justice?",The Punisher
416,dorlich,"Well written and casted, Beautiful cinematography.",8,7 July 2005,"Though I was unfamiliar with the comic book character, I was impressed with the all around quality of the production. It didn't hurt to have the cosmically beautiful Laura Harring (mullholland drive)cast as Saint's wife. Should have had more of her character. Thomas Jane turned in a very worthy performance, as I think it's difficult to play these comic book characters without causing nausea and guffaws. Interesting that there was a bit of philosophy re society and it's criminal element, kudos to the director/writer for a cogent screenplay. Did Jane remind anyone of the french actor in the original Immortal? i.e. his guttural delivery and dour countenance.",The Punisher
417,chet_head,MY FAVORITE 2004 MOVIE YET!,10,19 April 2004,"That's right I said it. The Punisher is my favorite movie I have seen this year thus far. NOT THE BEST, but my favorite. Let me tell you why...Now alot of times.. usually all the time, in a comic or book adaptation to the screen things have to change. Especially a long running comic series. Which is not at all a bad thing to change a characters written origin or whatever it may be if it makes a better movie. The Punisher does that very well. The ""minor"" things that it changes i.e. the death of his entire family and the Howard Saint scenerio were all done very well, not only to make what I feel is a very nice plot, but also they made the Punisher more likeable to people who are going in there blind. Not to say they made him weaker or pansyfied, but they did their best to make you say ""Yeah I woulda killed em all too.""Not to mention, THIS GUY REALLY LOOKS LIKE THE PUNISHER! I mean he's got that wide almost ugly face and dude is huge like a comic character, only put in the real world. Also the costume is GREAT! Forget about the b.s. Daredevil movie theory of ""a hero in the real world would wear leather"", well no... a hero in the real world would be wearing exactly what Frank Castle does in this movie. Not to mention they give the shirt an origin!Now going into this I was afraid it was going to be too Travolta heavy being as he's the big name and probably a main reason alot of people are going to see the film.  But I have no complaints there. It's not like he was hardly in it either, but really it was just right. Also there's a faint trinkle or relation that we can have with ""Mr. Saint"" as well. He's not a 100% pure evil villan. He's just a bad man, a human.I honestly, truly highly recommend this movie. From the preview I though it looked awful. I thought it was going to be even more senseless than the original only with popular music of today over top. But instead I was pleasantly surprised to see a bit of drama blended with dark surrealism and slammed with Punisher action.Not the best comic movie ever, or the best movie of the year... but hands down my favorite.",The Punisher
418,moondust17,Great Movie,10,28 April 2004,"This was a great movie.  I love movies when they take the time in explaining and developing the story.  This movie was not only developed well but it took the time in explaining the characters and the emotion of how the punisher became the punisher (the love, loss, heartache, punishing and so on).  This movie really shows his strength and power and his anger.  A lot of emotion and a lot of action.  One of my favorite parts was that whenever there was a big action scene there was no music in the background, it seems that every time a movie has a big action scene they show it off with some loud music instead of showing the raw action.  I really loved this movie and I can't wait to see it again and again.",The Punisher
419,action_jackson_0178,Great Overall Movie,7,16 April 2004,"Just saw the movie and must say it was pretty good.  I have never read the comic, but the theme is quite apparent.  The beginning is a bit drawn out, but I guess is necessary to set the mood for the protagonist.  John Travolta actually plays a pretty good villain, as do most of his supporting staff/henchmen.  The acting overall is pretty good; not very much in the character development area but the action more than makes up for this. Maybe it's just me, but there's a certain satisfaction in the whole idea of this punishment and the plot follows through on this very well.  Not many twists or turns, but entertaining nontheless.  No oscar awards here, however a definite must-see for any action flick fan.  Very much looking forward to seeing the next installment (I think there's scheduled to be sequels and I do hope so).  You won't be punished for not seeing this film, though you will most likely regret not seeing it on the big screen.

His body was totally sculpted and everything about this movie was great. The plot was amazingly done even though it wasn't exactly like the comic series. I don't like Rebecca Stamos all that much but she was awesome as well as the 2 other inmates.  It was a great action movie, like one of the classics and maybe there will be a sequel?

I had high expectations beforehand which were raised even higher immediately preceding viewing (while at a bar with folks who just saw the movie)...and my expectations were exceeded.I don't know if there's much to criticize.  A few things were over the top, but they fit right in and added to the comic book feel.Highly recommended for anyone who likes action movies.Even more recommended for bed-wetting liberals who think every criminal should be coddled and soothed.Give me Punisher over Spiderboy anyday.Also, it appears that one of the writers is working on the Fantastic Four project...that's a good sign.",The Punisher

There were a lot of twists and turns and found that it was less predictable than I thought it would be. I thought it was very well put together and was pleasantly surprised that I walked outta there lovin' it. I've already seen it three times and am still not tired of it. Thomas Jane was absolutely perfect for the part, and his body, might I add, was smokin'! He is most def the most gorgeous man I've ever laid eyes on.

And if it gets a higher IMDb rating, maybe that'll translate somehow to the sequels coming along down the track. Anyway...The movie in and of itself was good. On my scale I'd give it 71 out of a 100. Okay, it didn't quite live up to what I was hoping for, but I came to realize that, as a long-time Punisher fan, my ideal ""Punisher""(the character, not the movie) wouldn't make such a great film character. I mean c'mon, a guy who goes around putting bullets in bad people then walking away, all while showing no emotion or concern. Sure it's cool, but not very cinematic. In movies the hero has to be a little more creative than that.And let's be realistic. This movie was not made for ""The Academy"" or an audience looking for deep emotional growth in characters who, in the end, learn something...about themselves. It was made for people who wanted to see a bad motherfu*ker kick some ass. And I think that's what we got.",The Punisher

426,TimLax51,Classic revenge brought to our generation.,7,26 January 2006,"This movie came onto the scene with very little fanfare. It isn't a CGI powerhouse. There's no Matrix/Kill Bill style fight scenes. But what it lacks in modern trends it more than makes up for in a good old fashioned revenge plot. Touting a story that would have been fit for a Clint Eastwood flick like Outlaw Josey Wales or Hang 'em High, the Punisher takes the viewer on journey into the soul of a gritty vigilante. Thomas Jane plays the lead role to perfection, his voice acting is incredible. Although this isn't your daddy's (or Dolph's) emotionless Punisher. He is much more cerebral here than in most of the other media he has popped up in, and more human, but not any more humane. Using the tried and true style of fist fights and pyrotechnics this movie keeps the character rooted in his all too mortal persona. The supporting characters turn in equally descent roles, the likes of John Travolta worked well, although nothing outstanding. No doubt about it, Thomas Jane ran away with this one. He's just a normal guy doing super-normal things, with a lot of gunfire and explosions to boot. If you are in the target demographic (Male aged 17-30) you will definitely enjoy this film. If not, proceed at your own risk.",The Punisher

He in fact was a creatively sinister opponent whose only self-control moments were in avoiding collateral damage, and even that wasn't on his mind.And why can't they ever do his costume? viAnd what's with the nerdy characters?

I didn't expect much, same as I wouldn't (and didn't) of movies like Batman, Catwoman, or The Hulk.I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I was actually impressed! (Not easy to do) The dramatic and violent story was amazingly well balanced with the comedy and one-liners. The violence was not half as bad as I expected (although the one with the guillotine and the one with the knife through the chin at the end a bit unsettling...) And I appreciated being spared explicit lovescenes or a corny romance between Frank and Joan.

429,joeboz53,"Dark, gory & definitely what the Punisher is supposed to be.",8,12 February 2007,"I think that this version of the Punisher is far superior to a lot of recent comic book movies. However, you have to understand that it IS a comic book movie, so the character development isn't going to be extremely deep. Also, the effects (since I just watched this on FX's DVD on TV) were all done without the aid of CG, which gives the movie a different feel than say, Spiderman or Daredevil. This blows Hulk out of the water, as that was unwatchable. The actor playing the Punisher was very much what I wanted/expected and you cant go wrong when you cast John Pinette & Kevin Nash lol - seriously, the fight between ""The Russian"" and Punisher was AWESOME. There were enough explosions and general gore that reminds me of when I started reading the Punisher back in the 90s. Though, I think this movie probably didn't/wont get over with the general public because it doesn't contain a lot of the fluff that Spidey contained. Good movie, worth the 2 hrs, could have been better with a better performance from Travolta, but still a good flick.",The Punisher
430,ryanwalstrom17,God's gonna sit this one out...,8,26 June 2013,"The Punisher was not received very well by many people because, despite being a good movie, it had a lot of flaws. I recognize those, but I think that all of the positive things about the movie weigh them out so well, it's difficult not to enjoy it.Cons:Corny scripting. Specifically near the beginning of the movie, there's a lot of corny and even unnatural dialogue that just seems like it's trying to rush relationships between characters. The villain Howard Saint also throws in a few too many puns that just seem funny in a bad way.The beginning of the movie is rather slow at parts. It picks up eventually, but it took a lot of build up. The pay off is certainly worth it, though.Pros: Great acting from main characters. Specifically Thomas Jane, who played Frank Castle, and John Travolta, who played Howard Saint. Travolta was over the top at times, but in a good way that made the character funny and more enjoyable.Memorable and creative bad guys. The villains are not limited to gangsters like Howard Saint and his enforcer, Quinten Glass, but various assassins like The Russian and Harry Heck. Many of these bad guys, even ones only in the movie for a short time, manage to leave their mark on the viewerEnjoyable, realistic and creative action scenes. Lots of good hand-to- hand combat and shooting in this movie, always managing to keep the viewer's attention.*Spoilers in this next paragraph* In most movies, the main character forms a relationship with someone of the opposite sex, and they often fall in love, sometimes for no apparent reason other than that they are of the opposite sex, even if there's no real connection between the two. The Punisher does very well to stay away from this, however, and it doesn't force a romance between Frank and another woman in his apartment complex. The writers knew that not all movies, especially not this one, require a romance to happen, and that certainly benefits this movie's story and the development of the main character. *Spoilers over*Smart moves by Frank Castle. In this movie, the hero doesn't resort to shooting themselves out of every situation, and often devises other very clever plans in order to thwart his enemies.The soundtrack. Dear lord is it epic. I don't normally throw that word around and call everything mildly interesting 'epic', I mean it. The music is part of what makes this movie amazing. It does a very good job of building up dramatic scenes and emotions.All in all, I'd say definitely worth a viewing, unless you particularly hate action movies. This one isn't quite the mindless stupid shooting flick that's filled with crappy one liners (though I have to admit, they are there from time to time) and a lazy plot. It's well written and it's main characters are well developed.Easily one of my favorite movies of all time.",The Punisher

Sure, in the plot he's portrayed as 'the good guy', but really I mean what does this say about human nature? If someone does something bad to you, go right back and do it to them... I find movies of this kind to be quite discouraging, because the last thing today's world needs is for people to continue thinking this way.The only characters in this movie who appeared to have the least bit of moral values were the three roommates.

Thomas Jane was a good choice as well and was very believable and all the other actors (villanous and friends) were very well done. The only thing I wish could've been done is the violence a little more crazy. Mind you it is a comic book movie but at the same time it's a very savage character and comic. I think the violence could've been up(ed) a little bit more. Being that this is a vengeance film and your actions will have stronger meaning and intentions than just senseless violence.

433,metasac,"not awful, but pretty bad",2,6 January 2007,"i just got done watching this disaster on FX. i guess the most shocking thing about this movie is that Romijn and Travolta are in it. neither of them are hurting for money are they? i mean, aren't they still considered a-listers? ...this movie is only a couple of years old. they must have owed someone a favor. it's such a low budget, badly produce film that it was almost unwatchable. there are some scenes that were intentionally funny, though, i think. castle engages in what basically amounts to slapstick in the fight with the Russian. making a movie from a comic book usually obliges the director to somehow explain the origin of the dumb costumes that our heroes wear, yet which don't seem as dumb when you're reading the comic. the way it was handled in this movie was particularly lame and poor. will there ever be a director that can successfully deliver the story of everyone's favorite vigilante? doubtful, it seems.",The Punisher
434,theghostoftroubledjoe2001,They deserve to be punished,1,24 February 2005,"The review for this film sounded quite promising - a Marvel Comics adaptation featuring John Travolta in a bloody tale of revenge! Now surely that beats sorting your sock drawer...What was actually delivered was every cliché ever written down in the bumper book of clichés. A highly trained killer (Castle) finally retires for the quiet life with his family only for them to be brutally slain by the family of one of his previous hits. Left bullet ridden for dead Castle is revived by the local witch doctor and back on his feet within about ten minutes to exact his revenge on the man responsible, local money launderer Saint.From this point onwards it all just becomes a laughable mess of hit men dressed in matching black outfits, gay Russian contract killers who have shrunk their clothes in the laundry, heros with big jaws and villains who snarl a lot as it all goes wrong. The only passable acting talent comes courtesy of Travolta who gives one of his ""just give me the suitcase of money and the script and lets get on with it"" type of performances - reliable but hardly Oscar worthy. The script reeks of more cheese than a block of Stilton. By the end the violent finale you will be laughing at how corny (and ultimately boring) it all really is.This is one story that should have stayed in the comic book.",The Punisher
435,dennisdoperfantasy,A Realistic Anti Super Anti Hero Movie,8,29 July 2005,"This movie seemed to stick to the spirit of the comics. No radioactive spiders, no mutant genes, no demons and angels, no magic. In short, only a slight suspension of disbelief. Honestly the only scene that didn't seem completely possible was Frank's survival. It was entertaining and told a decent story. Its not perfect, the main villain is a bit over acted (easily over looked in a comic book movie) and Thomas Jane owns the screen.I'd definitely place this closer to something like Sin City than Spiderman, deadly serious with a few funny moments (it has the funniest torture scene in any movie I've seen) So is this a rent or buy? It depends on how you feel about a tragic revenge story, If its not so much you're thing, rent it. For those who like it, they like it a lot it seems.Can't wait for a possible sequel and where they take Frank Castle's Punisher character Overall an 8 out of 10 by me",The Punisher

I especially liked the fact that he is a hero without any super-powers who only has his big muscles and load of guns.Movie only shares basic story with a comic and nothing else. It seams that whole crew never saw more then one book of Punisher.The choice of the lead-actor was a complete miss because Punisher is an ugly big guy with black hair and Thomas Jane good looking blonde model?! But I have to say the T.J. performance was good.Story chosen for the movie is Frank Castle morphosiz to Punisher which is an absolutely mistake. In comic, Punisher only gives away pieces of this terrible event from his past, through many stories.And third and most important thing which this movie didn't show is true feeling from the comic. Punisher is lonely violent character who truly hates all criminals and extremely rarely shows any compassion. He is a judge, jury and executioner. Which is not nearly shown in the movie.In general very mediocre movie which didn't nearly shown the story and feeling of comicbook.",The Punisher

I was very excited about seeing it but.... I hated it. here's a few reasons why. If people are chasing you down with tech 9s and what not, there should be no counting to three before you run, just run. The punisher blows up cars in a parking lot to see his cool skull thingy. First off, people have to work in the morning. Not cool. Secondly, there must be a lot of time put into something like that, talking days here, because of course he would have had to plant each and every bomb, go into the building and see where to put the bombs, he would have had to have a car parked in the space, then hope that one of his eyes wasn't off.

442,melkorsservant1,One of the WORST comic book adaptations of all time.,3,19 February 2006,"I have been a long time Punisher fan and it amazes me that filmmakers struggle with making a decent movie about the infamous Marvel vigilante. Although Thomas Jane's performance as the Punisher was dark and pretty accurate, all of his costars were so bad that his performance was all but drowned out. John Travolta is one of the worst screen villains I have ever seen. This movie strays MUCH too far from the source material, and the movie as a whole is utterly pointless. The action scenes in the movie are pretty entertaining at times but the rest of the film ultimately falls flat on its face.

This has to be one of the worst films I've seen this year, and I've seen 'The Wicker Man' remake. The direction is completely inept, the writing is awful, the acting is even worse and the musical score is right out of an A-Team episode. And to top it off, the action scenes are poorly staged.Every...single...millisecond...his idiot neighbours were on screen I was overcome with physical pain. I literally wanted to cover my eyes and hide from the embarrassment I felt for everyone involved. The only way I could hate these guys more is if one of them was played by John Leguizamo. Sweet God in heaven.There was one upside to all of this, and that was probably THE single funniest death scene I've seen in years.

Great acting, great storyline, perfect dark brutal violence is what makes this film so really special out of all other marvel adapt ions. Other marvel movies I've seen so far from Spider-man 1 & 2, Daredevil, Fantastic Four, X2 X-men united. All these marvel flicks are great but The Punisher measures way up past great. Thomas Jane dose a great leading role as well as John Travolta a great villain role. Of course for all who have seen the movie all know the plot. After castles final operation spinning out of control killing one of the saint twins, Howard and Livia order out a brutal mob attack on castle family reunion, killing everyone, his wife, his son will, his mom and dad, cousins, uncles, I can imagine castles pain and taste for vengeance on the saint family. More other great work is the stunts the car chase sense where castle is hunted down by a bounty hunter harry heck of course hes some sorta country boy who was probably hinting castle with a tune that he was gonna attempt to kill castle who also gets his throat slashed by castle, a 2nd hit-man the Russian played by a great wrestler Kevin Nash probably without a doubt the most brutal sequence in the movie. Alittle bad language here and there but the best thing about this film is that it is very true to both the character and comics. The Punisher is a hard-R rated movie delivering a great action film of this generation. Fans of the comics will love this and probably by now are hoping for a sequel as I am myself! 10/10 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+ all the way :)",The Punisher
445,Real_Nowhere_Plans,"A movie that doesn't take itself seriously, and that's a good thing.",7,29 May 2007,"Like Kill Bill, The Punisher is a graphically violent movie that portrays its violence in a way that seems cool rather than cynical. It's a movie about serious things that, as a whole, doesn't take itself too seriously, like the comic books its based on. For instance, there is a major rumble between The Punisher and an intimidating adversary, but the whole time the focus is switched between the fight and some of his neighbor friends joking around and dancing, creating both suspense and a stylistic fight scene. Yes, there is cheesy dialog and there are predictable villains, but it worked for me in this movie. Finally, thumbs up to Thomas Jane for giving The Punisher some layers and a charismatic performance. It's just a little long, Travolta could have been better, and the end is a bit anti-climatic, but I still think it is definitely a movie worth seeing, and even seeing again.",The Punisher
446,zerberos-34371,The Extended Cut makes a huge difference!,8,22 July 2020,"(Major spoiler ahead)
The Punisher is, in my opinion, one of the best movies from the pre-MCU era. Aside from Spiderman 1 and 2, X-Men 1 and 2 and Blade 1 and 2, however, the Punisher is a more grounded story about vengeance... uhm, sorry, punishment. Some may say that the movie is not very realistic, because many people would die from a point-blank shooting, but the military history shows otherwise - if a man is built as a brick wall (and Frank Castle is), he can endure injuries that may be lethal to others. There is no flashy CGI (aside from the end, but hey, many movies have a guilty pleasure or two), the camera work is top-notch and the story is not bad. However, what I want to discuss here, is the Extended Cut, which, in my opinion, is the superior of the two. I am going to use TC as ""Theatrical cut"" and EC as ""Extended Cut"" from now on.
The 15 or so minutes that are added in EC, make a huge difference between the two movies. There are two major differences, one insignificant to the plot and one extremely important.
The first difference is the Torro brothers, who are shown as more than one-dimensional mobsters. In TC they are the men behind Howard Saint, and that is all. In EC they are displayed as partners, because Saint asks them to help him out with finding out who was responsible for his son's death, and they do by pushing the man who knows by exploiting his weaknesses. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. This makes the movie a lot more realistic.
The second difference is Jimmy Weeks, Castle's best friend. He is barely shown in TC, but is a key plot player in EC. The EC shows how he is in fact the one who provides Quentin with the info on Castle, which turns the movie from a simple revenge flick into a story about betrayal and comeuppance. It explains Castle's distrust of the system and the desire to go outside the law. It humanizes him and turns him into a realistic and relatable character. After I watched EC, I couldn't fathom why the editors decided to take the betrayal plot out. The fans of the Netflixverse's Punisher will love the it due to its relatability.
For the cinemaniacs, I recommend to watch both cuts to see the difference. For the viewers, I recommend the Extended cut, it is head and shoulders above the Theatrical one. 7/10 for the Theatrical cut and 9/10 for the Extended cut.",The Punisher
447,oxus72,"Ridiculous, pretentious, infantile and disturbing junk",1,15 September 2007,"I'm sorry, this one only works for sarcastic remarks. Someone kills your woman - u kill his woman! Someone kills your dentist - you kill his pizza delivery guy! There must always be balance, and it's not revenge, no, it's... PUNISHMENT! Why not, it's only fair. I think we should turn this into official legislation. Perhaps we might find some valuable guidelines in remnants from some remote tribe of the pre-stoneage era.Good thing though there happened to be some carefully rigged film cameras running before the hero set off those explosives in the end, because besides forming that ""cinematic"" and laughable flame skull, they didn't really produce much tactical use, did they now? Later when he runs into the next bad guy he might be going - ""Don't f*** with me, or I will not only kill your goons, make you turn on your own friends and loved one  but then as a final death blow to destroy you for good, I will also set fire to a huge number of cars that happen to be in the vicinity and make them burn in a calculated synchronised pattern to serve as a background to my pretty pose!""

Why don't we see this actor in more movies. He's excellent! What are this actor's plans for the future? Is he currently working on anything new coming out?

John Travolta also delivered a great performance, but he usually does though. I also liked Will Patton in this film, very chilling look with his shades on. My favorite scene in the film was of course the fight between the Punisher and the Russian. It was very brutal, and the fact that they played that song in the background kinda added some irony in there. I don't exactly know how though. But the parts I didn't like so much were when Castle came out from the elevator shaft as a thunder clap sounded, a little cheesy if you ask me. Another cheesy (actually it's probably more like cheap) scene is when Castle blows up the cars in the parking lot forming the Punisher skull. That wouldn't have been seen at that height and angle anyways due to the giant cloud of smoke. But overall I'd say this movie was pretty good, 9/10 stars.",The Punisher

451,Locin Blade,"Not perfect, but very well done",8,22 April 2004,"WARNING: minor spoilers, but nothing you shouldn't already know.This was a great movie, both as a revenge actioner and a comic book adaption. I'm a fan of the Punisher character, and although the filmmakers did make several changes in details, they stayed true to the character and basic plot, and that's all one can ask for, as far as I'm concerned. It IS an origin story, so of course for the first part Frank Castle is just Frank, not the Punisher, but it doesn't take long before he gets into punishment mode. The beginning is great, because it introduces his family just enough that you feel for him when they are killed, but not so much that it drags things out. How he survives his injuries at the end of the scene I don't know, and its really the only flaw in logic or realism in the film. The only flaw in terms of storyline I think is there is too much focus in the middle of the film on his neighbors, with too much comic relief. This is the sort of film that I think should only have humor in the form of one liners delivered by the Punisher himself. The action scenes were brilliant, and very realistic. The Punisher doesn't face twenty guys at once, kill them all and get out unscathed. He gets hurt, a lot, which I think makes him all the more heroic when he gets back up and keeps fighting. Its very true to the character, showing his determination to kill who needs to be killed, and his total lack of concern for his own well-being. Thomas Jane is perfect in the role, capturing perfectly the seriousness of the Punisher, totally devoid of emotion, never smiling. John Travolta was excellent as the bad guy, as usual. In fact, all the acting was quite good. All in all, a great film. Very violent, as it should be, great score, and with the promise of a sequel, which could be even more action-packed, with the origin story out of the way. 9/10",The Punisher

I would say to them: ""Please read at least on of the Marvel MAX series with the Punisher and if it does not get you, then OK, go and find something else to enjoy.""I, unfortunately, happen to be one of the first group - i have read and love all, or at least a lot of the comics with this character. Let me tell you, the only two things connecting this movie to the comic is the killed-family plot and the names. Nothing else. Nothing. The movie does not even come close to the the complexity of the main character (he is not just an undercover cop gone insanely drunk because he lost his family, in fact, he is not even a cop), the brutality (just take a glimpse at one of the comics) or the variety of the comic(in those series the Punisher sweeps numerous villains and don't tell me there is no way to fit at least three of the stories into a movie).Now a little about the casting and acting: Thomas Jane ? Not really. He just lacks...size. And this cute face just does not work. John Travolta - well, OK, fine, but then again, who is Howard Saint ? What does he do ? His character is way underdeveloped. Those comic reliefs were just ridiculous and i mean it in the bad way. And there is no point in even mentioning the support acts - they simply had the bad luck of having to be in the script.I have no way of knowing what were those producers thinking but they had the raw material for an action movie the size of Bad Guys or Die Hard and they just blew it.",The Punisher

Watching his improvement as an actor from Deep Blue Sea to Punisher was great.  I think he did a wonderful job...with what he was given.I have never read the comic book, so I can't say how it was as an adaptation.  I was, however, very disappointed with how the movie couldn't seem to decide which genre to be.  It jumped from wonderfully intense dramatic action, to corny b-movie violence, to dark comedy, to gruesome nastiness.  I'm not saying that they all didn't play a roll in the movie, and that they shouldn't all have been there, but they weren't very well integrated, in my opinion.  It felt like there were a bunch of different script writers with different views on how the characters should be portrayed, and that they wrote different scenes without consulting each other, and no one bothered to make sure that they held to the same feel.Some of the things I felt were hokey I could give credit to, as the movie is an adaptation from a comic.  But for Castle to be sitting around with his gun next to him, but it's not loaded?  Or to put that gun in a drawer before answering the door?

This movie is packed with movie clichés, with quotes like 'man I hate this job' and 2 funny characters just to make it entertaining. These 2 characters just keep reminding me of the power rangers. This is not a good thing. Clichés do not have to be bad in a movie especially not in marvel movies but in this movie it is just different. It reminds me of action movies from the 90's. The screenplay is bad, the mise-en-scene is bad, the story is not convincing and also the cinematography is not very good.It is not that I dislike marvel movies, in fact I love them. The punisher was even one of my favorite comic characters. This movie is the worse marvel movie I have ever seen. To bad such a nice comic character should be lost in such a bad movie. It was hard for me to finish this movie. In the end I had good laugh. How could a movie based on so much (good) comic material be so bad?! How did they manage to make such a bad movie?!

Again, I was surprised to see the theater fuller than it had been by Kill Bill on opening day. (Keep in mine this is midday Wednesday.) So I sit down and watch the movie. It surpassed my expectations greatly, and would've met them if they were high. The Punisher is a sombre film, admittably violent, filled with dark humor. All these combined together create a great film, yet obviously a different one than critics have seen. Ignore the critics. Do yourself a favour and go watch it.",The Punisher
462,butchcoolidge666,amazing movie,9,29 April 2009,If you like good action movies then watch this!! Thomas Jane is great as The Punisher. This movie could not have been done any better. I remember when this first came out and watching it for the first time.It absolutely blew my mind. By far one of the best action/comic book movies ever made. Forget about Spiderman and X-men this movie shows you how a real superhero would be if something happened to his family. And oh did I mention how great Will Patton is as Travlota's right hand man?? He is great... pretty much how great he is in all moviesThe entire plot is perfect... Just the right amount of time for the opening and explanation of why Castle is the Punisher and the following story is incredible. Travolta is OK like he is in most of his movies but Thomas Jane is exceptional just like he is in all of his movies.If you haven't seen 61* yet I highly recommend it. Also The Mist both great movies with Thomas Jane.He is by far one of Hollywood's best actors who deserves much more credit!! Watch his movies... He is greatOh yeah don't forget to watch The Punisher...amazing movie,The Punisher
463,BrockLi,Cheeeeeesy,3,21 April 2004,"I went into this movie expecting an action-packed, 2-hour battle. Instead, I got 2 or 3 decent fight scenes with a bunch of cheesy dialogue and bad-horror-movie effects.For example (and I'm ruining it for all of you here), at one point, a parking lot of burning cars shows a Punisher logo from a bird's-eye view (please).  John Travolta is dragged behind a car as it explodes it's way through said lot (cliche).  In one fight, he tosses a pot of boiling water on a Greek/Swedish looking ""Russian"", who's face suddenly looks like that of the Toxic Avenger (B-movie at it's best).This movie had so much potential.  I, for one, am disappointed in Hensleigh. A little more time on the dialogue, and this movie could have been fantastic.",The Punisher
464,Jeff-KSU,"Perfectly Dark, with enough light to see",10,19 April 2004,"SPOILERS First off, I have to say that the makers of this movie have done an EXCELLENT job. Travolta pulled off his role to perfection, and Jane did just as good a job as Travolta. But when will Will Patton get a leading role for once????Anyways, as far as the movie itself goes: Don't go looking for light fare. This movie is very heavy and Ultra dark, and even the ""comic relief"" characters - a fat guy, a guy with multiple piercings, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as a waitress - are there to be victims that Castle - Jane - has to save. Movie starts with a firefight, and even in the scenes throughout the movie where things aren't being destroys, its usually because some very brutal way of destroying things is being set up. (For example, Glass - Patton - pulling out the piercings of the comic relief dude one by one... that scene made my skin crawl almost more than ANY scene in ""The Passion"".)Very interesting movie from a psycological perspective. Great character development. Saint and Castle (Travolta and Jane) play off each other wonderfully. For example, Castle kills Saint's son. Saint kills Castle's entire family. Telling Castle's response would be giving away one of the best parts of the movie... but it DOES end with Saint's death. (Predictable there, so its safe enough to give away. Go see the movie to see exactly how it happens though... VERY cool!)Overall, this movie has been the best I've seen this year, and I really don't care what the critics say. Hands down, the best!JS",The Punisher
465,lemmingboy,"Better than the Dolph Lundgren version, but only by a hair.",1,17 April 2004,"Holy Cow, did this film stink up the joint.  It was definitely a film that I sat through, hoping moment by moment it would improve, but all it did was degenerate.I applaud efforts by the film makers to try and incorporate the better aspects of the recent comic run (the Garth Ennis/Kevin Dillon stuff) but did anyone else get the sense that it was a made for TV movie?What's been setting the recent comics-to-film movement on the high level it's achieved is the ability of the directors to put their stylistic stamp on their films.  Sadly, The Punisher was completely without style or personality.Thomas Jane was very good in the role of Frank Castle/The Punisher, but nearly everyone else around him just sucked.  (with the exception of Spacker Dave--he was just damn funny)  Travolta made the most un-intimidating villain in history, which is surprising considering the marvelous turns he's done in Swordfish and Face/Off.The one sequence I was hotly anticipating was the fight with The Russian, which was very well done and worth the wait.  In fact, most of the combat sequences were very well done--it's the in-between segments that fell very very very flat.  Boring, banal, and just all-around bad.  Poor acting, poor photography, and the absolute WORST background score imaginable.I've seen a number of reviews of the Punisher across the internet, and I cannot understand for the life of me why anyone would consider this schlock ""good"".  I have a feeling we may have not seen the same movie.",The Punisher
466,lsl79,Good adaptation,8,21 April 2004,"I don't think the critics were too fair with their reviews. I really did not see it straying too much from the comic (from the ""Welcome Back Frank"" storyline by Garth Ennis). The story was good. Granted, it would have been better if the main enemy was known, such as The Kingpin or Jigsaw, but nothing's perfect. The acting was pretty decent. It showed a very human Frank Castle, which is what he is. He has no super-strength, no super-speed, no super-anything. He survives only on his training and will. And the action was also very good. Good fight sequences and gunfights. Now, if you know anything about this character you know that CGI's are not necessary for it to work, unlike Spiderman and X-Men. This movie is just what it is. 2 hours of solid entertainment. Don't expect TOO much, and you will enjoy it greatly. 8 out of 10",The Punisher
467,bogdan_muraru,Very bad made,6,28 May 2006,"The idea of the movie is good but in my opinion, the movie could have been better. The scenes are badly cut. They don't have a natural way of succeeding. The action scenes are nice....but old fashion. Another thing are the lines. They are very bad, and it seems that they have no connection with the movie. In other words said, they are very poor. First i saw it at the cinema and i wasn't very impressed. Last night a saw it again, on my DVD and GOD, I was very disappointed. It does not seem natural. Also some scenes are very exaggerated....like the fight with the Russian. Come on !!! They break all the BRICK and CONCRETE walls......WHAT ? Is that possible? ....and at the end he says: ""I'm fine"" ....:)))) In this case it was more of a comedy !!! Overall...i wanted this movie to be better...especially for the character, for the ""hero"".",The Punisher

At first I had doubts about the film but I knew that I was going to see it regardless and I'm glad that I did.  It was very enjoyable with a good straight-forward story and plenty of action and funny moments as well.  I hope people who haven't yet seen it won't bash it yet cuz thats so stupid and lame.  You don't have to like the film, I did and I hope others will too.

469,Crosswinds,This movie will kick your ass (5 out of 5),9,18 April 2004,"I have nothing but good things to say about this movie, it kicked major ass. It's one of the coolest movies I have ever seen and defiantly the best Marvel movie yet.  They do a great job of depicting the Punishers character from the comic book, making him look like a total badass, but at the same time not making him look invincible like they do with so many heroes in movies. I won't give anything major away about the plot, besides to say that it's a great plot that's not too complex and at the same time not too simple or predictable.  The movie really makes you feel for the characters, without making it too mushy or emotional.  Another thing about this movie that really surprised me was the way they were able to blend in some great humor, with such a great dark action film. The action sequences are top notch; it's not what I was expecting at all, it was a lot better. If you had to choose between one marvel movies to see, this would be the one.",The Punisher

The action really gives you sensations of suspense and ""Oh, NO!"", and I was cringing with the velocity and the dramatic tension. Jonathon Hensleigh has done a really fantastic job with his first outing as a director.  It is a seasoned work. Travolta does a fantastic job as the heavy, a very subtle and threatening performance that is different from anything I have seen him do.  He also looks amazing. Thomas Jane is a new movie action hero, incredibly buff and also soulful, even funny when it is called for. See The Punisher: you won't be disappointed.",The Punisher

472,vdelburg,The Punisher,6,3 January 2005,"What can I say about this movie....This is a good film to watch. I mean if there aren't any good films to rent. I have to say that everything is very predictable (did I spell it right?). The reason might be that it's based on a comic story, most of these stories don't have any dept. I personally like the film Léon much better. Maybe I should say that the Punisher is to much American. On the other hand the film has some really though scenes and the acting is reasonably good. But for some reason it's not the kind of film I'll remember well after a few weeks. But lets be realistic, it's difficult to make a top class film. Despite of Travolta it's certainly not an A class movie. Sorry",The Punisher

This movie has it all; gun fights, fist fights, things blowing up, cheesy one liner's and villains that are nothing more than the final victim for the hero. Thomas Jane is excellent as the revenge filled Frank Castle. Travolta stinks it up a little, but not enough to make this movie bad. Forget what critics have to say about this movie. Just see it knowing that it won't provoke any thoughts, make you question what is real, or leave you with a teary eye. The drama is very minimal, as it should be for a movie that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. This should be on any action fans top ten list. Maybe top twenty.",The Punisher
474,Aventii,This movie Destroyed the Punisher's image,3,23 November 2004,"I hate it when they take one of my favorite comic book characters, and give it such a mundane script. The Punisher is all about EVIL. Not some some guy trying to kill a crooked banker for revenge. Sadly John Travolta's immense talent in menacing people was not used. His character is mediocre at best. This movie was too easy for the good guy. No challenge. Like nuking a fly.The Punisher is a comic book character. He needs to be more than an ordinary man. So does the villain. It is the villain that drives a comic. Lackluster-villain translate to a lackluster movie. The cinematography/stunts and other filming aspects were great. A little darker script with a more challenging villain would have been ideal.",The Punisher
475,VelvetRevolver2,Punisher too dark?,10,4 January 2005,"Someone said that this movie was too dark for the genre...He must not have ever read any of the source material. The Punisher may be one of the darkest comic book characters ever created. This film and especially Thomas Jane, get that. This film is one of the better in the genre, because it sticks to the source better than most.Yes, I am a fanboy. But I am a fan of action movies too. This movie took from some of the classics but made it their own. Its too bad that spiderman or superman fans cant see past the all superheros must be good guys...The Punisher is a different type of hero. The kind you wish we would never need, but also one that you may want.",The Punisher
476,praz993,"Strong, very strong.",10,18 April 2004,"IMHO, Punisher is good evidence that the darker comic heroes, if to be made into movie heroes, should be left as they are, and not dumbed down for kiddie revenue.The R rating they went for in this movie, allowed The Punisher to retain all of his gory goodness, creating an enjoyable comic movie both for fans of the comic, as well as action movie lovers.The opposite would be the 1997 Spawn movie, which took, arguably, the darkest comic character in history and turned him into a pansy, so that they could sell toys.So I say kudos Lions Gate on a job well done.I hope WB can do right with the upcoming Batman movie.",The Punisher
477,Alwayzsly,Surprisingly Thrilling,8,8 April 2004,"Let me begin by saying two things: 1) I've never read the comic. 2) I had extremely low expectations. I caught the screening a couple weeks ago in Philly and have been checking back with IMDB periodically to see if anyone else has commented yet. Well, I'll start. The Punisher had everything going for it to completely suck: Travolta in a villanious role, a superhero tag and a release date reminiscent of last year's debacle Daredevil, and a director with no directing experience and some so-so writing credits. However...The Punisher kicked some serious ass. Sure it had its cliched moments and cheesy one-liners...but the whole idea behind the movie, and presumably the comic is such a breath of fresh air from recent superhero fare. It's about time some flagged a superhero movie with an R rating...and believe me, The Punisher is no-holds-bar. Not to give anything away...but there's a couple moments in the film where the R rating is really utilized...most notably that scene from the trailer with the Giant dressed like Waldo. I saw The Punisher with a very intellectual Philly crowd, many film critics and Penn students, and incredibly, they loved it. There were gallant cheers and laughs all throughout as well as a huge round of applause once the final credits rolled. Now don't get me wrong...the Punisher is no Oscar winner, but if you're looking to just sit back in your chair with a huge bag of popcorn and enjoy a thrilling ride filled with laughs, 'oh my Gods', and 'YEEEAHs!'...then see this flick...it'll make you appreciate what studios can and should do with the Superhero genre...RATING: B",The Punisher

This movie blows the Dolph version away.  Trust me.  Go see this movie.  You will not be disappointed.  The main reason it turned out so good is because of the good acting.  Thomas Jane (in a star making role) is perfect and Travolta is perfect as the villain.   The fight scenes are well done and even have some humor tossed in.  This is one action film that won't disappoint.  I look forward to getting it on DVD to add to my collection.  It is that good.  Much better than recent comic book turned movies, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men 2.   This movie as well as Spiderman proves that the better the actors the better the movie. Go See IT.

Being so immersed in this character, I was afraid nothing could live up to my standards. I will let you know right now, that I LOVED this film. It's too early for me to give away spoilers, so I'll wait until after the weekend when some more of us have seen it.I know a lot of folks are afraid this is going to be another 'revenge' style movie that we've all seen before. The movie wasn't like that at all. In fact, I've never seen a movie like this before. Whatever I thought The Punisher was going to be, I was overjoyed by the movie I got, and was pleasantly surprised at how different this film was. Writer/director Jonathan Hensleigh (Armageddon, Jumanji, Die Hard: With a Vengeance does a great job of mixing in serious storytelling while injecting just enough comic book fare to be true to the source material. I think some moviegoers will have a hard time with the comic themes, however. Not to say it's bad, but in some of the negative reviews I've read for the film, I don't agree with the comments because they don't get the style of the movie, which really is like watching a Garth Ennis comic onscreen. A healthy dose of humor, and dark comedy help this movie stand apart as one of the great comic book movies of all time.",The Punisher
480,dare0677,Goood......,10,17 April 2004,"I found the Punisher quite impressive from beginning to end. Thomas Jane was really good as Frank Castle a man seeking revenge against the evil money laundering Howard Saint. What sets Punisher apart from other films based on Marvel characters is that the Punisher is real. He doesn't rely on powers and enhanced sight to get the evil doers. The music paced the story well, the acting was good, the action of course was good. Will their be sequels, possibly. I liked this one better than Hellboy for sure. Thomas Jane really scored with this one. Travolta was good as always. Adding Schieder as Castle's father was interesting ( was wondering if it was a Shark hunter reunion).

This film will please the hardcore fans as well as everyone else.  A great blend of storylines from the comic books were used.  The updated origin was great as well as the use of comic book writer Garth Ennis' characters (the neighbors and the Russian).

I don't pretend to be a comic book fan, but I have enjoyed some of the movies that have come out based on them.  Not this one, though. You feel bad for the guy at first, but then the writing turns ridiculous, then schmaltzy, then campy.

I've been a fan of the comic book series for years and I have to say that it wasn't that bad of an adaption. I'm not really an action movie fan since most are so darn idiotic it churns my stomach, but this one held my interest. I have to say it was just so nice to see a knock down drag out fight, real stunts, real explosions, and a hero that doesn't feel the need to punctuate every action with cheeseball ""one-liners"". In short, it was exactly what I expected a Punisher movie to be. The feel was gritty and sorta felt like Deathwish ala The Crow, but with some great humor thrown in. And poo-poo on the critics who call it brutal and over the top...didn't you just go see The Punisher? Hello, it probably should have been more brutal.

The film is ok, reminded me alot of the film ""The Limey"", which was a revenge movie that moved really slowly and lacked vitality-- but still managed a decent showing.  Punisher is no different.  The film is slow and the characters lack development to keep up interest.  Spacker Dave, Bumpo and Joan could've been replaced by cardboard cut-outs, because they were so devoid of life.  Howard Saint was no exception, Travolta didn't live through him or bring the character to life, but simply read the lines and picked up a check.  It bothered me that there was an amalgam of story-lines from the comics, War Journal and Welcome Back Frank-- it sort of took away from a cohesive plot that should not have relied on 2-3 different storylines because Michael France thought Dixon's writing was ""cool""- or how the Welcome Back Frank comic storyline was doing really well lately. It was tiresome- what should've happened was for the film to give the reigns to Garth Ennis, then the film would definitely be great, period. The esthetic of the film was ok, nothing amazing there.  It was shot on location in Tampa, with exception of the beach scenes it could have been shot anywhere.  The usage of numerous fade to black moments was annoying as well; I haven't seen that tool used so many times in succession in an action film. The bottom line is, the writing came from an amalgam of different comics from over a decade apart, then were used in different parts of the film where the writer then filled up the gaps with his own work.  Blech.  The cadence of the film was irregular and mostly slow; hopefully the sequel will fix that.  I don't want to denigrate the film, I think it's great they tried, but hopefully the sequel will be better.  In the same sense that X1 was pretty slow, then X2 came along and was great.  It's just that you can't have 9/10 of the characters on screen act lifelessly and work with bad screen writing and expect a *decent* comic-book movie. If you want to see it done right, go see The Punisher, then go rent Batman 1 or X2.  The proof is in the pudding",The Punisher

All Punisher fans will be thankful that we finally have something else other then Lundgren's pathetic attempt.  In my eyes, Jane made the best Punisher anyone could ask for.  His size fits perfectly, and his face isn't far from what I've came to know as Frank Castle.  The action was splendid, using creativity to enhance the violence.  Yes, his dialogue wasn't too extensive, but have you ever read the comics?  He doesn't ramble on.  So that matched his persona as well.

It is a wonderful experience that all should experience on the big screen.  This will definitely be one that I add to my collection come DVD release time. All of the dispute about Thomas Jane should be set aside, he is the epitome of Frank Castle.  He fits the part to a `T' and handles the hi-intense action beautifully.  An amazing hero emerges out of Thomas Jane.  He handles the material handed to him seemingly with ease.  John Travolta (Howard Saint) was wonderful as the villain.  He is witty and just genuinely evil. Will Patton (Glass) does another great job acting in this movie, as Travolta's sidekick in evil. A great wonderful thing was the detail that actually went into Travolta's Character.  He was just not the enemy and that was it, he was in it enough to get a feeling of who he was rather than just hear say, yet, not in it to much.  I loved that touch. Perhaps the best thing about the movie is the amount of realism that existed.  It is wonderful to see it be portrayed with a life like sense, rather than say `Kill Bill' where more blood flows out of them than the human body can hold.  The only reason he seems to survive is because of his background of being in the marines.  He uses it to perfection, as well as just blind luck and immense planning to help his survival.  I think this is probably my favorite marvel movie as of yet, simply because he is a superhero without super powers.  He is a man that is just exceptionally well trained from his background and doesn't need to fly or have immense strength that no man or woman can hold.",The Punisher

He held his own next to John Travolta.  Not only did this movie keep you on the edge of your seat with eyes glued to the screen it had some hilariously funny one-two liners.  John Travolta also never ceases to amaze me the in the rolls he decides to take on.  As Howard Saint he delivers one of his best performances that I have seen.  It was great to see him in a father roll of young men not just the hunky guy.  This movie needs to be placed up for some awards.  I give this movie 4 1/2 stars out of five.

Why not scenes that explores Quinten's sex life?  The ""family"" love scenes gagged me....that is easy to do in 5 minutes, not 30.

I have followed the character since the early 80's and was very excited to hear that they were making a movie based on Garth Ennis's Punisher. However, once I heard about the details of the movie I became extremely skeptical, but went to see it anyways out of loyalty to one of my favorite comic book characters. I could not have been more disappointed with the complete bastardization of a great anti-hero. First and foremost was the horrible decision to make him an FBI agent in Tampa Bay of all places. Then, as always the jackasses in hollywood decided to totally screw up his origin by having him be at a family reunion in Puerto Rico when his entire family gets whacked. For those of you who are unfamiliar with his TRUE origin, he was a NYPD cop who's wife and kids get caught in a mafia crossfire in central park and die. How they got the Idea to have him at a family reunion in Puerto Rico is beyond me. The Punisher has only been one of Marvel's top characters for over 20 years, God forbid they let the actual story stand on it's own merits. As the movie progresses it only gets worse. ALL of the acting was uninspired to say the least. Thomas Jane himself was a deadbeat and could not have been a more boring Leading man. There was never any real rage or anger in his character. I was hoping at the very least to get to see Frank slaughter dozens of badguys in cool and creative ways as only he could do, but instead they made him almost into a goody-two-shoes. This is the Punisher not batman. This guy's filled with murderous rage. Instead they make him into the ""thinking man's killer"". Having him blackmailing the badguys into killing each other. That's not Frank, he shoots first and asks questions later. And the entire time he gets immense satisfaction from it. That's just how his character is. Also,whoever the ""genius"" was, who wrote this abomination also decided to take a whole bunch of characters and pieces of 20 years worth of punisher stories and cram together into one jumbled, incoherant piece of garbage. It's like they were reading cliffnotes of the comics or something and totally missed what makes this character so interesting. One other hideous side note was the entire time during the movie, he didn't even attempt to hide his identity. At one point he even walked up to city hall in front of like 50 camera people and yelled at the chief of police for not arresting anyone for killing his family. If I was the chief, I would have said,""it took place in freakin' Puerto Rico what the hell am I supposed to do."" Most of the time he just hung out at his apartment building like an idiot where everyone knew he lived. Any badguy worth his salt would have sent 20 guys over there and put him out of his misery. The atmosphere in this  movie was also a big zero. Most of marvel's movies with the exception of the Hulk have been really good about delivering the atmosphere of the comics. Not this one. But what do you expect, it's in Tampa for christ's sake. Nothing against Tampa, it's a beautiful city. But for a gritty tale of revenge it just doesn't work. Overall, this movie is terrible in every way. I was really hoping it wouldn't suck, or at least even be mediocre, but it was a bomb. Not since the fourth batman movie has there been such a terrible comic book movie. It's not quite as bad as that but it sucks none the less. I actually left the theatre angry. Whoever directed this movie should be banned from ever directing again. The only one who got punished was the audience.",The Punisher
492,wastedrockranger,suitable apology for dolph lundgren,8,18 April 2004,"just saw the new version of the punisher, and i thought it was a very well done representation of the comic book, while being a good enough action movie to stand on it's own.although several changes have been made from the comic to the movie, i think it captures the spirit of frank castle very well.  my favorite scene was when frank was interogating micky, as it was taken almost frame by frame from punisher warzone of which i have the first twenty issues.my main complaint about the movie is in making frank a cop or fed or whatever and having his family killed as revenge from a criminal.  i've always felt that the comic book's version of his origin was much more powerful.  in the comic book frank and his family are picnicing in central park (the comic takes place in new york not miami) and basically get caught in crossfire.  i've always thought that the randomness of it made it much more powerful, and the fact that in the comic, frank never got the chance to kill his family's killers, but instead spends the rest of his brooding life punishing criminals in the same violent manner in which his family was taken from him.i still think it is a great adaptation of a comic book, stays true to the feel of the character, and is a long awaited apology to that horrible movie with ivan drago in it.",The Punisher
493,DP_davewilliams,"Great Marketing, good film, IMMACULATE SONG",10,18 April 2004,", This was a great marketing scheme by Lion's Gate/Artisan/Marvel/other rich people to get the word out on this film.Teaser Trailer last summer: I don't remember very much about this, other than I crapped my pants after seeing the words ""The Punisher"" on the big screen. I thought to myself, why am I sitting here watching ""The Hulk"" when I could be in the future watching ""The Punisher."" I also thought about how I needed to change my pants.First Trailer: I love this trailer. From the opening ""Pay It Forward"" music accompanying Frank Castle with his wife (""we are blessed"") and the Roy Scheider family reunion speech (""something poignant about family reunions"" *toasts* ""to the future!!!"") My dreams of a seaQuest movie were finally coming true, but then the Artisan/Marvel logo came on screen and we see the pleasant family reunion (the first hint this is fiction) getting interrupted by guys with big guns. We have the wife and kid get capped, Frank gets blown off the dock, and he washes ashore. Then, lo and behold, he finds a shirt on the beach (this was my favorite part, I thought it was just random, though the film explains it pretty well, ""to ward off evil spirits"", I guess since assassins aren't spirits, it didn't do the family any good)
Then, we have awesome lines like ""They were DEAD wrong."" and ""I'm already dead."" Then, my fave part, we have my big hit ""Bodies"" blow your freakin brains out of your ears while we have a quick montage of awesomeness from this film.
Trailer 2: You're probably not STILL reading this because you are not awesome or you are listening to my song ""Bodies"". But this trailer is cool because of Mark Collie (playing mariachi/assassin Harry Heck) performing his seminal work ""In Time."" I'd cover it, but it's a little slow compared to my stuff like ""Bodies.""
By the way, the movie is good.  I'd see it again at a matinee.",The Punisher
494,DarthNeo1383,Entertaining Popcorn Flick,8,19 April 2004,"While watching this film, I was surprised by the violence. But when looking at comic book films featuring heroes with extraordinary powers and the nature of The Punisher comic itself, this movie was a welcome fresh breath of air. Tom Jane nailed the lead, as a man with nothing left to live for except revenge. John Travolta is like he is in every other movie he is in: Awesome. The supporting cast provides excellent comic relief when laughs are needed. There are some hokey parts along the way, such as when Frank takes a gunshot wound to the chest at point blank range, but these scenes are few and far between. A fun R-rated Popcorn flick. Highly Recommended to Action Movie fans.",The Punisher

I would like to respond with one word: DUH!!! What did you think it would be about with a title like ""The Punisher""? If you don't like it wait for a Power Puff Girls movie or something. Put yourself in Frank Castle's position, if someone just showed up and slaughtered everyone you ever cared about, what would you do? Awesome movie! I enjoyed the hell out of it, Thomas Jane kicked serious ass playing this part if you know the character. Dolph Lundgren? What a pussy! He should of quit acting after Rocky IV!

This is SOOOOO much more.  This film renews my faith in the credibility of the Punisher.Being a long time fan; having grown up on the comic itself, this film truly lent itself to the plus column.  The cinematography was great, the photography was great, the story line was pretty spot on, a little less stan lee and bit more bullets (wait-is that possible?  MORE bullets?) and it woulda shown even brighter.I 10'ed this one.  It's that good IMO.Again, this was MADE for us, the comic reader.

497,jviviano1,The Punisher Is An Anti-Hero,6,21 July 2012,"What The Punisher lacks in depth it makes up for with shooting and violence. Thomas Jane does an excellent job as Frank Castle, a retired FBI investigator driven by revenge after his immediate and extended family are murdered. John Travolta plays the slimy, jealous villain Howard Saint, the man responsible for the murders. Will Patton (Remember the Titans) is the sadistic Quentin Glass, Saint's legal adviser, accountant, and right hand man. I'm not familiar with the comic book series, so I didn't really have many expectations going into the film. The Punisher certainly does not display any of the noble characteristics of superheroes we've grown to love. After his family is killed and he recuperates from gunshot wounds, he becomes bent on taking matters into his own hands to bring Saint and his family to justice outside the bounds of the law. When the local Puerto Rican resident who nursed him back to health urges Frank to ""Go with God"", Frank responds, ""God is going to sit this one out."" His words were prophetic because what follows is dark, brutal, and violent.",The Punisher
498,elsneako,Worst Marvel movie adaption ever,1,14 June 2004,"Maybe because I am a comic book maniac (Marvel) my opinion is way too harsh, but, folks, save your money and don't watch this movie!1. Boring story, no surprises - as always some changes for a vast audience have been made (different origin of The Punisher, different origin of Skull, different location, different behavior - The Punisher ALWAYS kills anybody who might be a criminal, he never would spare any; fair enough: The Russian of Ennis/Dillon is nearly impossible to adapt for the big screen - so why not let him out? this version of The Russian was ridiculous)2. Bad actors (Tom Jane is a 2nd rate Christopher Lambert who is even bad enough, Roy Scheider disappoints absolutely, as well as Will Patton; only Travolta is as good as always) 3. Bad Making of the movie (bad camera, bad sf/x, bad score)4. The German version is cut though it is rated ""Not under 18"": Ridiculous!I was that bad disappointed. I cannot tell. And all of it - I have waited to read the comic book adaption of the movie until I had seen the movie. You know what? The comic book movie adaption was even worse!Why in heaven's name did Stan Lee and Avi Arad produce this crap? I couldn't believe when I saw the credits! This movie is the worst Marvel movie adaption ever. The Punisher from 1989 with Dolph Lundgren is just a typical B-movie from the 80s but much, much better because it is much more like the comic book Punisher -in spite of he is not wearing the Skull. Hopefully the next adaptions (Man-Thing, F4, Ghost Rider) will be better. But I doubt it:Blade: Very good X-Men: Good Spider-Man: Pretty good Daredevil: Fair Hulk: Poor Punisher: BadGuess what the next movie will be?",The Punisher
499,jeroentimmermans,"This is not revenge, it's punishment for the '89 version",8,30 July 2004,"WARNING: this review may contain minor spoilers.I went to see this with the Dolph Lundgren movie in the back of my head. The first Punisher was OK, but had farely little to do with the original comic. Thankfully the movie stays true to the comic. At least, for as far as I know; I haven't read the ones that explain Frank Castle's motivation for going on a killing spree. The explanation laid out in the movie is a good one. This one of those movies that rely on an actor's ability to show certain emotions, in order to understand him. At first, I thought Brad Pitt would be perfect for the role, but surprisingly Thomas Jane pulled off a more than respectable job. ****SPOILER****I will never forget the look in his eyes when he finds his wife and son dead. I actually felt what he was going through, and I was amazed by it. I'm happy to see they took the time to show Castle as a family man, someone you'd want as a friendly neighbour. Someone you'd wish no harm. And the timing of the attack is perfectly timed in a sentimental moment. Brilliant!****SPOILER END****The supporting cast does a sufficient job. Travolta's bad guy just doesn't hold up, and even Rebecca Romijn Stamos who put a good show in X-Men 1 & 2, just doesn't seem to bring the emotional part to the movie that's she's supposed to bring in. The special effects are not what you'd expect from a superhero movie. Since Castle is basically your average Joe with guns, with no freaky powers like flying or shooting fireballs out of his nose, the special effects are limited to explosions and make-up effects. And both are done extremely well.So to wrap it up; does Thomas Jane (who looks remarkably lot's like Christopher Lambert in this film) hold a candle to Dolph Lundgren? Well Dolph might have the muscles, but Tom has the emotion AND the same build as the comic character. I think Thomas Jane is the better Punisher, and might become the next big thing in Hollywood.The Punisher got a score of 8 from me, since it's highly entertainable, with emotions, without getting mushy like Spider-Man 2.",The Punisher
500,INemesisI,"""Worst comic book based movie"" - Award",1,22 June 2004,"This is the worst movie after a comic book I've seen so far. The plot of this movie is so thin, you could slip it under a door. I think it is called the punisher because the audience is punished by it. It's like one of those movies in another movie, where they are joking about how bad certain movies are. The whole time I had the feeling that someone might just come in any second and say: ""Hey, it was just a joke, don't be mad, the real movie is starting in a few minutes."" A. Russell Andrews's acting was the most horrible thing about it I guess. ** spoiler ** : The only time we were laughing was when the punisher got beaten up real good by that Russian guy..... **/end spoiler** I liked X-Men and Spiderman pretty well, but this......I'm trying to forget......shame on the people who like this kind of movie, you make them do more stuff like this, don't you see? bah :)",The Punisher
501,moikkamoi3,Expected a bit more...,2,11 February 2005,"I expected more of this movie and was pretty disappointed. I did not have my expectations too high, but this was not even close to being worth the time. The original comic would have required a better movie. My opinion, the only 'dark' thing in this movie was the poor quality of the whole thing - sorry for that if your liked this flick. In short: lot's of action, original story and some scenes of the comic acted out, some attempts at trying to make the audience laugh, mediocre acting at best and a failure to create a similar atmosphere to the comic. To get the atmosphere right requires more than just money and a bit more than Jonathan Hensleigh had to offer.If you want to see a Punisher movie, I'd go for the 80's version with Dolph Lundgren. Not too good either, but much better than this.Too bad. - Peke",The Punisher

Not enough violence i think, not enough cruelty and not so savage Punisher. I loved the ending with the explosions and the fire-skull. John Travolta on a role that fits like glove on the hand. John maybe is the name that saves the cast. I think that a Punisher 2 must be made for all Punisher fans. The movie was more like an editorial to the real thing Spiderman 2...",The Punisher

A little inaccurate in terms of following the comic, but great acting, lots of big name people, and lots of action. Frank Castle is so sweet, especially when he fights Kevin Nash. In my opinion, this is one of the best movies marvel has made, up there with the Toby Spiderman movies. Great movie, super underrated. Kind of a dark role for John Travolta, but he does a good job. Somewhat follows the plot of the play Othello, but very loosely. The beginning is really sad but the rest of the movie is great. Lots of sweet fight scenes, fast cars, gun.

Ray Stevenson isn't The Punisher, Rebecca Romijn was a great actress in The Punisher, Ben Foster and John Pinette were SO funny.

John Travolta's BAD GUY face adds a steady drumroll through the movie that kept my attention. With regards to Thomas Jane (err whatever his name is)... I think that I only liked him for the part because he looks a lot like Christopher Lamburt did fifteen years ago.. and after watching the Highlander movies it is easy to buy him as a bad !**.I think that if he had Christopher Lamburt's accent too, it would have helped his role.As to my vote of 8?

This movie was quite good, and I was on the edge and I hardly ever get this interested in a movie. Before this movie, I didn't care anything about the punisher, now I am a punisher fan.

This movie is based off a comic book. It may lack some parts of the story, some parts happened in the movie that never happen in the comic books..but as far as i can see this movie is excellent. Budgets don't mean crap to me. What makes a movie is the acting, the plot, the storyline. Know what you are going to get into before you pop the DVD or tape in the machine.. or spend money to see the movie.Know that this is a comic story. This was not made out of nowhere and the first time the punisher has ever been heard. For many yes it is the first time. I thought this movie was genius. Tom Jane played an amazing Frank Castle and Punisher. What you need to understand is..comic book hero's also have a soft side. Any comic person would know this. They are vulnerable and that is what most of their weakness's are.So no, The Punisher was not portrayed as too much of a pansy. If that were the case Stan lee or any other write of punishers comics would tell the write and director that.i give this movie a 9/10 for only having one flaw.

The Punisher 9/10,9,25 December 2004,"For the review before mine; I don't know how anyone could even begin to draw comparisons between The Crow and The Punisher. As stated by them...they've obviously never picked up a comic book. This movie stayed true to the Punisher storyline, while modernizing it quite well. They also introduced a new villain-Howard Saint; played by John Travolta.They slightly changed the history of Castle's family being murdered-making it his ENTIRE family, rather than just his wife & kid, but it played out very well for the movie. It made Frank want nothing more than revenge.If you're a fan of The Punisher-You'll love this movie. If you're a fan of Action Movies-You,ll love this movie. Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle flawlessly, and Travolta is the perfect cold hearted villain.I give THE PUNISHER 9/10, and rank it as one of the best films Marvel Entertainment has released as of yet.",The Punisher

Frank Castle is a rock hard action hero, who puts nothing in the middle and doesn't get distracted by anyone to reach his objective.The movie has some great action scenes. Many of the stunts where done by Thomas Jane him self. Not many stunt double scenes. Not much digital fake crap here. That makes the scenes look authentic.

514,Brock_Dainjer,Film Punishes Viewers,1,13 February 2005,"Three words come to mind when walking out of the theater after watching Marvel's latest ""The Punisher."" VOMIT INDUCED HAZE. There is nothing about this movie thats good, and its such departure from the bad-ass comic that it'll just irritate you.In the comic, The Punisher is spawned when mafia hit-men are sent to eliminate Frank Castle and follow his car into Central Park. Unbeknownst to them, Castle had lent his car to his wife and kid, resulting not only in their untimely and brutal deaths but also a heavy guilt that haunts Castle relentlessly. After this attack, his entire life focuses on taking down the people who murdered his family, as well as all evildoers who inflict pain on others.The movie, on the other hand, begins with undercover agent Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) finishing his last mission before taking early retirement to dedicate his time solely to his wife and young boy. As the mission goes awry, a gun fight erupts and a stray bullet strikes down the son of Howard Saint (John Travolta), a major crime boss. Saint, in turn, sends his first lieutenant, Quentin Glass (Will Patton), to Puerto Rico with instructions to kill Frank Castle and his entire family. From this, The Punisher emerges, and his clichéd and predictable quest for revenge begins.The casting of Jane damns the movie from its start.(With Sarcasm)Thomas Jane, who stole our hearts as the bumbling groom in the instant classic that was ""The Sweetest Thing,"" fails in his portrayal of the brooding title character.""The Punisher,"" as a film, has plenty of potential. But as long-time writer, first-time director Jonathan Hensleigh found out, making the transition from comic book to film is not as easy as writing such gems as ""The Young Adventures of Indiana Jones."" His adaptation comes off as a poorly written action-comedy rather than the dark, revenge-driven film noir that the comic deserved. Much of the film is wasted on meaningless scenes instead of the action that the viewers paid to see. This is especially present in the script's unnecessary addition of Castle's neighbors, who add little to the film than various ""insert joke here"" lines.The body count of the film is also painfully low, and two of the people most responsible for his family's death fail to die by Castle's hand. This is not how the comic-book Punisher acts. Instead of playing mind games, he puts the gun to his enemy's head and pulls the trigger.Although some of the film's intentional humor was decent, albeit inappropriate, the funniest was not intended to be so by the producers of the film. The movie ironically uses over-the-top slaughtering of Castle's entire family, including uncles, cousins, babies, neighbors, some random guy on a sailboat and the family dog. Despite the extreme cheesiness of this sequence, none of the deaths were executed in a memorable or original fashion.Castle's eventual revenge on Saint, which should have been highlight-reel material, left far too much to the imagination instead of perpetrating the graphic and visceral death his character deserved.Aside from being drawn out, poorly written, terribly cast and horribly shot, the movie also fails to accurately depict the unstoppable, bad-ass Punisher from the comic. The substitute is upsettingly soft-sided.For fans of the comic, the movie will induce loss of all faith in humanity. The 1989 version starring Dolph Lundgren, a failure in its own right, still beats this poor attempt of a film. The only people punished by this film were those who bought tickets.",The Punisher

It is a perfect length, too. I wish that I could have been in that movie working with Tom Jane. That would have made my life so happy.

516,Jonesy_1987,What could have been,6,7 June 2005,"This film could have been so much more. Thomsn Jane is a very good actor who is now showing what he can do in Stander, but I'm not sure whether to blame the usually reliable Hendsleigh or Jane for a lack of hatred and anger towards the gangsters. Being a huge comic fan, I've read many Punisher comics in the Marvel Nights series and the latest MAX. Although MK isn't as graphic, he is the same character who is extremely violent because he is driven to kill every criminal for his great loss. He is the guns of the Navarone in human form, he IS vengeance, and it just isn't captured. The apartment tenants, although used in the comics for humour, spend way too much time on camera, as most Punisher comics spend their time on Castle or on the people who will be suffering an inevitable bloody death. They were there to show what his life could be like if he didn't go down the route he does, and they end up leaving a mark that smells like 'wow, maybe he can still be human' when they should be brief to show he isn't coming back to normality. A decent enough film on its own, but a tragic conversion form the comic, just as Constantine was, but not quite that bad a conversion. Lets hope the Punisher 2 can take light from Sin City that the core of a comic book movie needs to come from the comic book.",The Punisher
517,mrslormann,We call it The PunishMENT...,2,25 April 2005,"I have to really dislike a movie to rate it this low, but The Punishment earned it. Such great special effects and stunts were RUINED by bad acting by the ENTIRE cast including the-usually-fabulous Mr. Travolta and a very poor plot line. I was especially disappointed by the waste of a potentially great movie and budget. There is no variation in emotion with the exception of the semi-comic relief of the 2 dorky neighbors. The constant intensity of the movie got boring after about 30 minutes of Jane's I'm-gonna-kill-everyone attitude. RR-Stamos looks hotter after just waking up than in this movie - another waste of talent. Laura Herring was beautiful, but boring. The promised sex scene between her and Travolta was a no-show. The City of Tampa was excited to have a high budget movie in town...even offering HUGE price incentives to ""blow up"" parts of the city. I wonder if the residents of Tampa regret the sacrifices made after seeing what promised to ""revive the entertainment industry in Tampa."" What a waste of money...a LOT of money.",The Punisher
518,Rapideb12,Better than the 1989 version,5,22 March 2005,"I just seen The Punisher for the first time the other day. I found the finished product to be your average action movie.The acting was acceptable particularly from Tom Jane as the vengeful anti-hero. John Travolta was OK as the main villain he could've shown more interest in his role. He looked nothing more than a cardboard cut out.The action set pieces were at a high standard, it just goes to show what a director can produce with a limited budget of 28 million. The fight scene between Castle and the big Russian guy was spectacular. The finale was good as well with Castle destroying Saint's empire, all guns and bombs blazing.I thought the script could've been tweaked a little bit, I mean there was no ambulance or cop car throughout the film. It seemed Castle's retribution was fulfilled within a lawless land. The only time you did see the authorities was the plain clothed officer at the morgue and then two plain clothed officers outside the courthouse. When Castle had stated that justice for his families murder had still not been looked upon.Will be interesting to see what the premise what will be in Punisher 2, when it comes out in 2006.",The Punisher
519,elguy18,what the....,5,2 May 2005,this movie makes no sense at all... why couldn't the guy with the earrings just lie about the punisher's location?? how dumb can you be?? and why wouldn't the punisher stay with the hot chick at the end?? how does he survive getting shot in the chest and the explosion ??? and how does he get well after only 5 months being able to fight with that huge Russian guy?? and why didn't the Russian kill him right away?? and why didn't the bad guys shoot the fat dude and the other one with the earrings?? these people were stoned when making this movies... you can only have so much luck and the people here pushed it... maybe if i was like 10 i would have liked this movie but even the beginning wasn't that good,The Punisher
520,cjsloan5,one of my favorite marvel movies,10,22 June 2015,I love this movie and I am a huge Punisher fan. The movie is action packed and entertaining from start to finish! I believe the movie is underrated and deserves more recognition. I highly recommend this movie and any action movie fan will love it! Thomas Jane did a great job playing Frank Castle/Punisher. This movie made me really want to read the Punisher comic and learn more about his background. Such an interesting character! The only complaint i have with this movie is that i wish jigsaw was in it. I did think John Travolta played a great and convincing villain. This movie needs more credit and when you watch it you will understand why. It is easily in my top 3 favorite Marvel movies.,The Punisher
521,donaldwolfram,Another terrible portrayal of a Marvel Character,1,6 May 2005,"Anyone who knows anything about the Frank Castle/Punisher character would be shocked to see that this film scored 6.2 on IMDb. This is a terrible portrayal as well as a waste of John Travolta and Laura Harring's talents. Laura Harring, who was in amazing in Mullholland Drive is reduced to eye candy. I do understand her being casted because she is beautiful but she can act as well!!! Why cast her if she is not give a role to act? Why can't Hollywood not get this franchise right? It is simple. A man capable of unbelievable violence is thrown into darkness and vengeance following the death of his wife and child. It is pretty simple. Yet, Hollywood feels it has to throw a love interest into the mix in the shape of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos who is also completely wasted by not being allowed to act on any level. She is accompanied by two bumbling comic characters, one performed by Ben Foster. I can only describe the comic performances as irrelevant and pathetic. When did Punisher ever sit down for a meal in a white t-shirt with the neighbours because they were being nice??? This may sound picky but the Punisher character is much like the T-1000 character of Terminator 2. He is cold, decisive and absolutely driven by hunger to act eliminate his targets. Three course meals ain't his style. Now for a spoiler, at the end when Punisher kills of the bad guy, he just happened to have clipped bombs to about 20 cars and when the bad guys body is being dragged through the exploding cars, a birds eye view is shown, showing that the burning cars are in the shape of a burning Punisher skull. That shot would make it into anyone's top ten cheesiest Hollywood film moments of all time. I am not a die-hard comic fan, but I have read a couple of Punisher comics and what I got from them is that the Punisher is much like the New Batman character that Christopher Nolan is trying to create. He is a real man without super powers who has experienced great loss and has the knowledge, strength, financial resources and weapons to act out his revenge. It is good that Nolan's Batman will probably be what Batman always should have been, but it is very sad that The Punisher is still a long way off, even after a second attempt.",The Punisher
522,acevenom-1,It could have been worse,9,9 July 2005,"I remember seeing this on the big screen when it came out and I was pleased. This isn't your regular superhero film. In fact, the Punisher isn't a superhero. Frank Castle is similar to DC's Bruce Wayne in the fact that he has no powers, but still wages a war against crime. The similarities end there. The Punisher does not hesitate to kill his enemies, which is what I think dealt a serious blow to this movie's box office take. As a movie, it works. The plot, story and writing are all top notch here, but some of the characters suffer at moments. It's a minor nitpick.What really hurts this movie is that it is like the action movies of old. Frank Castle actually looks like he could do the things he does because he's in incredible shape. But the movie was low budget and had an R-rating. Comic fans would have complained if Punisher didn't at least get an R-rating, but with studios hungry to make money by releasing PG-13 movies to lure parents into a comfort zone when it comes to their kids, this movie suffered.It also debuted the same weekend as Kill Bill Vol. 2, which hurt the amount of theaters it could debut in. Critics praised the weaker of the Kill Bill saga simply because it was Tarantino, luring many of us into a false sense of security. I was let down by the second offering of Kill Bill, but not the Punisher. That the movie was able to make its budget back, but not turn into a successful blockbuster (it was actually the first of the modern Marvel movies not to debut in the number one spot) and comic book offerings like Hulk and Fantastic Four flopping (well, Fantastic Four hasn't flopped yet, but it will), it's a sign that Marvel is running out of steam for cinematic offerings. Marvel needs to concentrate on its flagship characters or it will just lose more money on these other offerings.",The Punisher
523,Hornetresto,So bad It was almost funny,1,3 August 2014,"Absolutely horrible movie. Acting, dialog, script were all poor. I kept thinking it was done as a farce on purpose. I only hope Trivlota. was paid in advance. Does the main actor have any talent? Couldn't see it. I can't believe that anyone could write a good review of this film. And you must create ten lines to have a review published. I believe that equate to mostly PR hacks taking the time to write most of these reviews. That must be the reason that a movie like this gets positive reviews. This really is a poorly made movie. I can't call it a film as it's just not even good enough for that label. Is this another Scientology backed movie? With Travolta in it I always wonder now, after that horrible scifi movie he made.",The Punisher
524,Tinamya,Punishment 'aint far from the mark,4,16 July 2006,"They've called it ""The Punisher"", and the name isn't far from the mark. This is truly one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. At the beginning, in the confrontation scene that set the premise for the movie, the actors and the storyline didn't seem so bad. An undercover cop (Frank Castle) kills the son of a wealthy, powerful man (Howard Saint - John Travolta). The wealthy man gets his revenge upon the cop's family who, after losing everything and everyone, decides to take retribution  not revenge! Oh no!  into his own hands.But then it progressed.And got worse and worse.The main actor didn't seem too bad, but he sure wasn't given much to work with. The poor script drowned him, and the neighbours with whom he became acquainted were simultaneously clichéd and unbelievable. Their characterisations  kind, abused woman, comic obese man, ex-prisoner weirdo - made them cliché. Surreal motivations - why on earth would a man submit to torture to help a complete stranger? - made them unbelievable.Costume didn't improve matters. Did they really think that dressing Frank Castle in a t-shirt with a skull made him cool? Made him an awe-inspiring fighter? A skull t-shirt? Honestly. And the concept of the 'Punishment' seemed a bit pathetic to me. An eye for an eye? What makes him any better than the killer whom he kills? Nothing  except his word, of course. Noble Frank Castle punishing wrongs. Sure.The only reason I didn't walk away from the movie entirely was because John Travolta can never be anything but fantastic to watch. He is wasted on this movie. My stars are for him alone.On the other hand, my older brother enjoyed it. So if you love your violence, you're willing to suspend disbelief, and don't mind sub-par action movies, go ahead. But expect plot-holes, cheesy characters, and a lame storyline  in short, punishment. You watch the movie, you pay the price.",The Punisher
525,bobandhelga,Excellent movie adaptation of a complex Marvel character,9,11 November 2014,"This movie does an excellent job of helping the viewer get inside the head of Frank Castle. That's one thing I've always liked about the comics; they do that too. Frank doesn't kill people for fun. He's driven by grief, the failure of the justice system to protect innocent people from organized crime, and possibly his own sense of personal failure in being unable to protect his family--an unrealistic expectation given the circumstances, but Frank probably doesn't see it that way.Frank's survival is portrayed as a small (or maybe not so small) miracle. It's as though he's back from the dead to ensure that predators will not be allowed to continue trafficking guns, drugs and vulnerable persons without a day of reckoning. Along the way, he's stunned by neighbours who put their lives on the line for him because ""he's family."" They do this even though he's a stranger who has brought them ""nothing but trouble."" This picture of unconditional love is a stark contrast to the ruthless violence that characterizes the lifestyle of the crime family ironically known as ""the Saints."" In the end, there is a day of reckoning for the violent, and those who choose to ""love their neighbour"" receive their reward.In my opinion, this film is a work of art. The extended cut also offers a more in-depth look at Frank's betrayal by a fellow-officer, who loved money more than his friend, and had his own personal demons (i.e. Judas). I enjoyed it, but it's quite a bit darker. Perhaps those who like their Punisher best served this way would prefer the extended version.For my part, it's faithful to the original comic-book character. Mind you, I began reading Punisher back when it first became an independent title. It's gone through several different visions since then.",The Punisher
526,a-pye14,Action packed but very cheesy with mediocre acting.,5,17 April 2015,"I'm surprised at some of the reviews in here, as they seem mostly positive. I will add that I have not read the source material, so I might be a bit biased. However I found the movie quite cheesy and unrealistic (in a bad way). The first part that made me laugh was when Castle gets shot in both his thighs, then dragged down to a dock where he is shot point blank to the center of the chest. But wait, he is surrounded by gasoline by the gunman sent to kill him, who proceed to light the gasoline, causing an explosion that propels him back 15 feet into the ocean. Oh, and then he swims to shore where he is rescued by the local ""witch doctor"" who revives him back to health. I'm pretty sure even an incredible team of surgeons would have a tough time with that one. Later on, Castle has a chance to kill the son of the man who coordinated the death of his family, but instead decides the dramatic ""stare then walk away"" was a much better affect. My favorite part though was the very last scene, where Castle orchestrates a grand finale explosion by destroying dozens of cars and creating the skull image of ""The Punisher"", a task which surely took the better part of a day.Riddled with horrible one liners and mediocre acting, I don't think this is a movie I'd recommend. In it's defense however, the action was fun. Besides, watching Thomas Jane fight was entertaining, especially because he wasn't talking during it.",The Punisher
527,catatonicpupil,I was outraged by how terrible this movie was/is,1,12 July 2005,"The directors claimed to be fans of the comic, and yet seemed to ignore several key features of it. I am a big fan of ""The Punisher"" comics, and am quite disgusted at the fellow fans that have loved this movie. While I can forgive the casting of Tom Jane (he's too young - Frank Castle in the comics is around 60), there are far too many unforgivable mistakes in this movie - a movie that had so much potential.For starters, Frank Castle had two kids, not one.""The Punisher"" is based in New York, not Florida. New York is fabulous because it's dark and gritty - it has a layer of brooding darkness. Florida is sunny and hot. I don't care how tight the budget of the film was, Florida was a ridiculous choice.Joan is plain and meek. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is neither.Why was the fight between the Punisher and the Russian devoid of dialog? The Punisher in the comics has a very dry sense of humor, especially when losing a fight. The Russian is somewhat jolly, for lack of a better word. The lack of dialog between them in the movie gave the fight scene a very strange emptiness that need not have been there.I rented the movie with low expectations: all I wanted was violence, and lots of it. Even this was unfulfilled. The Punisher manipulated Howard Saint's relationships, as opposed to just killing everyone. While the Punisher did use a 'FRONT TOWARDS ENEMY' bomb, when he saw that someone survived the blast, he walked away as opposed to shooting them. A quick comparison.... In the comics: The Punisher kills a former mafia boss at his 100th birthday party. He then shoots the guests that come after him. After they all fall, he shoots the bodies to make sure all are dead. He then bombs the funerals. In the movie: Prior to the climatic fight scene, the Punisher had only killed four people (= ridiculous). The Punisher is merciless and brutal. Tom Jane's Punisher fell well short of both.In the climax, the Punisher set up a bunch of cars to set on fire, displaying his skull logo. This was utterly pointless, and I think, completely out of character.Perhaps I would've enjoyed it as an action movie had I not been a fan of the comics. But, call me old fashioned, I believe comic book adaptations should closely follow the comic books. 1/10.",The Punisher
528,carsonrichard,"""Punishment""................Far from it!",1,16 July 2005,"This movie sucked in so many ways. When I first saw the previews of the film, I thought this was going to be action-packed ride from beginning to end. Turned out to be garbage. The punisher was supposed to be a ruthless killing machine. Stabbing people with knives and blowing heads off, not framing Howard Saint's wife and best friend. If have ever played the punisher video game, it's way better than the movie. He didn't even have a fist fight with Howard at the end. It could have been a lot better. My heart goes out to people who went to see it in theaters. Plain and Simple. It's WACK! It's a disappointment to fans like me.",The Punisher
529,jonathan-42280,Spoilers!,7,4 November 2015,"Odd Ball ""Hero"", The Punisher (2004 film) Although the character The Punisher has a lot to do with revenge and justice, the message behind this particular film is that it's possible to overcome the painful memories from a tragedy and continue with life by making new, good memories. This is not the normal message behind most films with superheroes/heroes, but this also isn't a normal superhero/hero movie.When compared to a stereotypical superhero/hero movie, this one hardly fits in. The perfect way to describe the differences between this film and the average superhero film is by the first ten seconds of The Punisher (2004). In the introduction of the film it shows the standard red and yellow Marvel sign in the center of the screen. Within a few seconds the colors fade until the whole thing is gray and black, then bullets rip through the letters. This is a perfect way to visually see the mood of the film. It starts off with something that could be compared to an average superhero film and then immediately turns dark and gruesome. It is certainly aimed towards a more mature audience and isn't exactly kid friendly.Don't get me wrong, there is still a slight superhero feel. There are still a few characters in there just to serve as comic relief, there is still that main character who completely changes from some event and turns into something unique, and there is still the main character with his own signature weapons and uniform. However, instead of wearing bright red white and blue on his uniform like Captain America, The Punisher wears all black and a white skull on his shirt. Sometimes he wears a long coat as well. His uniform slightly resembles the grim reaper. Not to mention the name The Punisher. Also, the event that changes him wasn't some lab experiment, it was watching his entire extended family get slaughtered in front of him. The Punisher doesn't get some super powers from this event, the only thing he turns into is an alcoholic. It's almost like a deranged play at a superhero movie, but it's a nice change from the standard Marvel film.The music in the film was an interesting choice. It was always dramatic and a little suspenseful. A fair amount of the music played was from an orchestra and can be compared to that of an old horror film. The introduction, specifically, has an orchestra playing a particularly dark and mysterious piece and then the music is cut off by the sound of a boat horn. Interruptions like this take place constantly throughout the film. This immediately sets the mood of the film and foreshadows how disruptive the future events will be.The scenery in the film is always a little dark and sketchy. Take his new home for example, it has absolutely no color, it looks old and beat up, and it looks like it's been a crime scene about a dozen times. Perhaps this reflects how empty his life was after the tragedy. At the end of the film, he moves out, so maybe this shows that his life isn't quite as empty now that has overcome some of the horrible memories. In addition to the house, the film as a whole is practically black and white with the exception of the brightly colored cars and dresses. What's odd is that the bright colored objects are usually associated with the criminals rather than the good guys.The fighting that takes place is way more gruesome than the average superhero film. There are scenes where a guy has every one of his facial piercing pulled off with pliers, a man gets a knife through his throat and is visible in his mouth, another guy gets his head split by some sort of paper cutting blade, and another guy gets an arrow through his throat. In all of these scenes there is large amounts of blood and added effects to make the gore seem more realistic. This is very different from the usual comic book style fighting that seems to never cause a drop of blood.The Punisher's signature weapons, although he uses a large number throughout the film, are the two customized 1911's his father owned. The 1911 is arguably one of the most recognizable and patriotic handguns, so it is no surprise that it would have a role in the film as his means of getting justice. However, it surprising that they would have an ex-navy seal use what is in some ways an outdated weapon. However, his father added a compensator to the end of each handgun. This reduces the recoil a little but also makes the gun much louder. Maybe it's because The Punisher wants to make as much noise as possible. This makes sense when comparing it to the fighting style where at one point he stands out in the open with his bullet proof vest and essentially absorbs the shots rather than trying to sneak around and pick people off. The guns have a relatively traditional style in terms of finish and grips, but then after the customizations they look similar to modern competition handguns. They resemble a modern twist to something traditional. I think this reflects well with The Punisher because he is also sort of a traditional hero with a modern twist. The message of this film is helped displayed by the mentioned scenery, music, fighting, and guns as well as Frank Castle's development through the story. His development is significant because he eventually decides not to give up and that he can still do something with his life. Of course his version of doing something with his life is becoming a vigilante and essentially hunting down those who have done wrong. The lesson to move on is an important lesson to learn for anyone who is trying to get past difficult memories or just move on from small things that might bother them.",The Punisher

What was unfortunate was that this character had a tremendous amount of potential on the big screen, and somehow the creative team squandered every last drop of it. It could have been made as a brutal noir-esquire tale of revenge, and yet it turned out as one of the cheesiest, most boring films ever made. Travolta is simply re-hashing his role from 'Swordfish' and his acting is over the top and stupid. Plus, that little soul patch under his lower lip makes him one of the least intimidating screen villains ever.

The scene where Frank's (the punisher) family is killed shows no emotion. When his wife and child are killed, he isn't even crying, he just picks up there heads and kind of sits there.Oh it gets worse The fighting is made for third graders, yet the random gore is enough to disgruntle a GTA addicted teenager. Did I mention that the director is so bad at his job that when frank is being bashed in the face his face still looks like he just came out of a modeling shoot.My favorite part was when the punisher had is monologue, oh yeah, that was awesome, when they absolutely butchered his catch phrase.

540,brett-40985,Review I Wrote for School,6,23 February 2017,"I think it is a good time to bring another movie review the 2004 movie The Punisher, directed by Jonathan Hensleigh. The reason I feel that it is necessary for me to bring this movie back up, is because of the new Netflix released series Daredevil where we see the Punisher make appearances in. If you are a fan of the series Daredevil I feel that it is a good idea to watch this film to better understand the Punisher. The whole point that I want to bring this movie back is because of how well it does in showing Frank Castles life change. The beginning Frank Castle is an FBI agent who works in busting international crime dealers. What seemed to be a routine last job went sideways. One of the people who were killed was the son of Howard Saint, who is a crime boss in Tampa. The Saint family are distraught over the death of their son they send their men to go and kill Castles entire family. After surviving the hit Frank Castle now wants to get back at the people who did this to him. So he makes his way back to Tampa and starts getting ready for what he calls is justice. Which is why I feel that its important to watch this film, to really see how Frank Castle turns into the Punisher. With that I felt that he plot was good. I wouldn't say it was the best but it defiantly did a good job with Frank Castle. The only issue that I have with it, is when Henry Heck came into town that part felt rushed through. It felt like it was an after thought with how short the scene was for that character. Other than that the movie flowed fluently throughout the movie, really showing how Frank Castle was changing from a man into a killing machine. The plot wouldn't be much though if the acting of the actor playing Frank Castle didn't fallow through, which I thought Thomas Jane did well. Thomas Jane plays Frank Castle in the film and does the transformation justice. When he returns to where his family was murdered that is where we first catch a glimpse of him becoming the Punisher. He I thought did a good job playing the straight faced, man who has been through a lot very well. Which was shown with the shape that he was in to play the role. Thomas Jane in the movie looked like a guy who was a mission when he to over as Frank Castle, with how big he was. To even help the case even more I felt that the cinematography was just what you would expect in an action movie. The fight scenes where they would focus on Thomas Janes' face really feel as a third party in the room. The steady camera work for one shot where Tomas Jane punches the camera makes you flinch to get out of the way was brilliant. In the end this movie did justice to the Punisher. It really makes you connect to him and feel him and would always want him to continue what he is doing. Also if you are a comic book fan this movie I felt brought the Punisher to life and which you would enjoy.",The Punisher
541,sharkydx,This is one of the worst comic book movies out there,1,26 July 2006,"Holy crap. Who are these people who think this is a good movie? I've read several of the user reviews, and the best thing they've got to say about this movie is that it's rated R and it has some humor.THIS IS THE PUNISHER. If anyone has ever read the comics, or has any kind of familiarity with the punisher, they would know he isn't supposed to have any humor. He is a dark, violent, anti-heroic vigilante. Yet, this crap movie shows him smacking people with frying pans, and his big fight was almost cartoonish. After he got hit, I almost expected him to hold up a sign that said ""ouch"".John Travolta plays his way over-the-top villain as he has for his past few movies.This is one of the reasons people don't make more comic book movies, cuz this is crap, right along with Daredevil, Elektra, and the Hulk.If you want to see what the Punisher movie should've been like, watch Man on Fire. No humor, no frying pans, just pure violent vengeance. And yes, it too, is rated R.",The Punisher
542,danielcarville,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...,2,14 February 2018,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of the character. I enjoyed both other movies, especially the Lundgren one, because they were so damn entertaining. I loved the show because of how raw, brutal and emotional it was. I'd seen lots of fan reviews of this version, most of them absolutely scathing, but I thought I might be able to find some good things in here, as I usually do with bad movies.This one doesn't know if it wants to be a mindless, dumb action movie, or an important, depressing revenge movie. It accomplishes neither, and just ends up being boring, with a boring villain with boring henchmen, a boring supporting cast and a hugely toned-down lead.It also barely even warrants an R-rating. Most of the deaths consist of bad guys shooting into the crowd, and random family members falling down, with the exception of the climax.Avoid as a punisher movie, avoid as a movie. Go for the 1989 movie instead. It's a blast.",The Punisher
543,hotstuff69-3,Typical,1,25 November 2005,"This movie was SO darn typical! This woman falls in love with this guy after seeing him once! Oh..and then there is a pierced guy who goes through torture and says he knew where the dude was but wasn't going to talk because they are family but has only spoken to this guy twice. Oh and you can't forget the time he comes out of his hiding space, shirt ripped, bleeding everywhere, and just when he reaches his peak in height, there is a bolt of lightning to light him up. Can't believe the Russian guy either..yeah, lets take a toilet, hit the guy through a wall, then see him seem untouched by it. Then there was the point when they all were in the same room and 3 of his supposed ""family"" stood there and watched as this Russian tried to choke the living daylights out of him. Love John Travolta but he should have wasted his time with this movie. Please...don't waste your time if you don't like stereotypical movies.",The Punisher
544,abijoijoi-92557,"SO well done, my favorite comic book movie!!",10,17 March 2019,"Just watch it. Twice.Sorry, I've been told my review is too short.The acting is intense and believable and excellently comicbook-y. The more I watch it the more I notice beyond the action, the more i focus on the excellence of timing, tension, ability. Opera! Who knew?!John Travolta as an EXCELLENT bad guy. Cold, sentimental, contained, and his incredible end.Plot twists, great exit lines, adrenaline rushes...really, what more could you ask for?Hope this is long enough now, because I'm not telling you anything about the actual movie. Just watch it . More than twice!",The Punisher
545,peacefulmadman,"Please, do not watch this film. It is bad.",1,22 August 2006,"This film will leave you sorely regretting the loss of 2+ hours of your life; hours spent waiting for a good punchline or a thrilling action scene, or even a few seconds of screen-time with the attractive female lead (who spends about three shots on the screen). No, a soundtrack that is a rehashed uninspired childish version of all other Marvel films, and fight scenes that would leave you crying with laughter if it wasn't simply so painful to watch. I can't go on talking about this film...i'm going to be sick. Please, Please, Please take my advice and spend your time elsewhere (if you really need some punisher action the original 80's film is at least watchable...by comparison).",The Punisher
546,kendalljo-10820,A boring slog that I couldn't even finish,1,10 January 2019,"Firstly, I noticed within ten minutes that the pacing is all over the place. This movie jumps from intense ""action"" to conversations between mildly related characters in a way that seems unnatural. Secondly, the budget cuts that I've read about elsewhere really show. The Punisher shirt that is given to Frank by his son is very clearly a cheap piece of preexisting merchandise, and the camera quality looks similar to modern indie movies (and Pulp Fiction, which came out a full decade prior).
To me, a good movie, and a good story in general, should capture the interest of the audience. This movie fails at this, but could've been redeemed if it was simply made to be mindless entertainment, but it isn't. Frank Castle is a preexisting character, and as such should be treated with the kind of respect by the writers that they would show, say, Batman or the Joker. Frank is extremely out of character, having mercy for the people he perceives as guilty. When ""torturing"" a criminal for information not long after his family is killed, he doesn't even physically harm him. The Punisher is a character known not for taking pleasure in hurting others, but still having the conviction to dish out the punishment that his namesake implies.Honestly, I think some people can probably enjoy this movie, but I personally can't as I can't seperate it from the source material. The high-profile actors could not save this, much like they couldn't save Dragonball Evolution.",The Punisher
547,Director2000-2,So lala.....,4,4 February 2008,"oook, it was definitely better than the rest of the Punisher Movies. But compared to the Comics? NO WAY!!! I don't like an ex-Highlander to be my Punisher (Christopher Lambert) and the plot was not really fit for this character. First the story compared to the comics was totally changed. I mean the ""birth"" of the Punisher. And the military background is also important, since the real Punisher always refers to his experience from the time in Vietnam. I wish there would be a producer who would really know how to show a real Punisher story to the audience. The actors were so lala, the plot was more than ordinary and other ""revenge"" movies can easily compaire to this Punisher and last and least the whole reason of being the Punisher was turned upside-down... :-(OK guys, if you want to bring the ""real"" Punisher up to screen follow this instructions: His family was murdered randomly in a park, which is the key to his fight on crime. (Not like in the movie just against a single family). Second, the measures of fighting crime are quite hostile and very military-like. He brings the know-how of the military experience he has on the ordinary street crime. And because of his contacts and especially ""micro"" (pleas check the comics for him), he has a technological advantage to the crime mobs. He fights big and small crime alike. So I would like to also see a movie where this aspect would be considered. Regarding the revenge of his own family refer to the black and white series of the comics. Even that plot would fit much better on a screen than the screenplay we've seen!!! So reconsider to bring a new Punisher on screen with the true and hostile soul he really has, to fight the lowest crime mobs all aorund the world. Then you would be making much money in producing sequels of high quality revenge cinema blockbusters I (we) really wanna see!!!! Sorry folks, this movie was just too weak to measure the true anger of the Punisher.",The Punisher
