0,SnoopyStyle,a bit of fun,7,6 November 2019,"Max (Jacob Tremblay), Lucas (Keith L. Williams), and Thor (Brady Noon) are best friends who call themselves, the Bean Bag Boys. It's sixth grade and they face difficulties. Max gets invited by the cool kid to a kissing party. The boys struggle to learn how to kiss which gets them into trouble with two high school girls looking for their Molly.The boys are fun and appealing. The foul language is fun but more often than not, it's the boys not understanding which makes it funnier. The girls are good although the movie lacks the scary bully which is often the villain in this type of movie. There are a couple of questionable things happening. The plot is simple and has its fun. It's the new Wonder Years but not as iconic.",Good Boys
1,nogodnomasters,You always have the best toys,7,25 August 2019,"This is a story about 3 tween buddies that is not for tweens. (""We're not kids. We're tweens!"") Max (Jacob Tremblay) wants to go to a party where there will be girl kissing. He is crushing on Brixlee (Millie Davis) and would die if anyone else kissed her. The events leading up to the party is the main farce of the picture as the guys get a lesson in life. Several lessons actually. The film is a comedy ""romp"" about the curiosity of tweens, as well as them being ignorant of adult items.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.

2,kosmasp,Moral ambiguity,8,25 September 2019,"So good might not really mean ... good. Then again who decides what that word is supposed to mean? Or rather what the moral implications are? The qualifications to be called a good boy. One thing is for sure: this was done to be enjoyed by an older audience - and that is not meant in a weird way. It has so many swear words and violence in it (not to mention innuendo), that the stars of the movie are not allowed to watch it themselves in the USA.If you are not easily offended, if you can laugh about young boys being innocent but also getting into some really dangerous territory. If you won't judge in general and try to find something to hate about this - you will have a good time! It is meant as a fun ride, nothing more and nothing less",Good Boys
3,view_and_review,Pre-Teen Superbad,6,26 August 2019,"This was one of those movies that was a victim of its own trailers-as in most of the funny parts were already shown in the trailers. That's an excellent tool to get people in the theaters, but it is a lousy tool if you want them to enjoy the movie once they've paid to see it. Too much of the movie was spoiled by the trailers. There still remained some funny parts but I still felt cheated.This movie was pretty much Superbad for 12-year-olds. Honestly, the only difference was that these kids were trying to get to first base (well at least one of them) while in Superbad they were trying to hit a homerun.I gotta say; I was kinda torn. On the one hand their innocence made some of the scenarios funnier, but on the other hand it was a bit twisted to have kids handling drugs, drinking beer, playing with sex toys, and cussing like sailors. They were like miniature Andrew Dice Clays.It's funny I'm saying this, but this was a coming of age movie. Most of the time such movies are reserved for teenagers but this was for pre-teens. The Bean Bag Boys (as they called themselves) were all sprouting into their own and finding that they had different interests. They wanted to continue being the Bean Bag Boys but that required more of a sacrifice from the three of them because their interests were no longer the same.Max (Jacob Tremblay) wanted very much to kiss his crush, Brixlee (Millie Davis).Lucas (Keith L. Williams) was clearly the nerd. He was taller, overweight, unathletic, and had a penchant for telling on himself. His likes were ""rules, anti-drug campaigns, and grilled cheese sandwiches.""Thor (Brady Noon) just wanted to fit in with the cool kids. Whatever it took to be considered cool Thor wanted to do, even if it meant abandoning what he loved and adopting something he disliked.Because I have my own kids I was hoping that the depravity would be kept at a minimum-at least with the kids. I don't need to see 12-year-olds drinking beer, buying drugs, or talking about their big you-know-whats. I know that's part of the comedy of it all but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't wince a little at some parts. This movie made me want to check on my kids ASAP.",Good Boys

5,neil-476,"Charming, funny, and quite sweary",9,25 August 2019,"Max, Lucas and Thor, pre-teen best friends are aiming to go to a kissing party - Max badly wants to kiss Brixlee. But none of them know how to kiss. Worse, there are complications arising from Max's Dad's drone being held hostage by two older teenage girls.Let me start by saying that a great deal of profanity issues forth in piping treble from the young lips of the three pre-pubescent protagonists. This is going to be a deal-breaker for some, and I confess that I didn't feel wholly comfortable with it at the start. And I can see why some say it's trying to be another Superbad.But there are two reasons why that's not fair. One, Superbad was polluted by the odious character played by Jonah Hill. And, two, for all the swearing (and drugs and sexual paraphernalia, these are, truly, good boys. They badly want to be grown up, but they aren't. Much of their put-on airs of age and experience are based on ""back of the bike shed"" knowledge, wildly and hilariously inaccurate. These lads are charmingly and delightfully innocent, which means that the film, despite the bad language, drugs doll etc. is also charming and innocent.I laughed at this quite a lot.",Good Boys
6,siderite,"Started great, then went overboard",7,11 November 2019,"The worldview of children is always hilarious, especially when they try so hard to be cool and pretend to know everything about exotic things like sex, number of sips of beer, parties and so on. So imagine three kids who go through this adventure in order to learn how to kiss, because they were invited to a ""kissing party"". The concept is both funny and really sad, considering we are talking about social pressure applied to 12 year old children. Anyway, the movie started great. It was endearing, funny and had a good premise and reasonable actors (and we all know how hard it is to find decent child actors). However after just 20 minutes it went completely off the rails. Instead of surfing the funny vibe, the makers of the film just ramped everything up to 1000%. Smiles became exaggerated, shouts hysterical, skewed childish worldview grotesque and everything unnatural and feeling fake.Bottom line: after a great start, I just couldn't continue watching it. The attempt to make it all larger and funnier made it creepy.",Good Boys
7,thesar-2,"Just the Good yung' Boys, Never Meanin' No Harm",8,23 August 2019,"Come for the raunch, stay for the climax.What's most refreshing about this obvious Hard R Superbad for tweens, is that it felt real. As real as it could be. Okay, granted little boys, sorry, tweens, can explore sexuality and wonder about kissing, etc and maybe these kids do it to an extreme. Granted I'm nowhere near their age and I know none of my childhood plus buddies were even a tenth this vulgar or curious. But, I guess times change.Point is, no matter - it felt real. I sincerely felt like I journeyed alongside these three main character boys throughout their expedition for one them to kiss the girl/future wife of his dreams.Basically, that's it. One third of a group of ""Bean Bag Boys"" gets invited to a party where he could kiss the girl he's been stalking and he gets his other 2/3 gang friends to accompany him. Along the way, they encounter extraordinary mishaps and adventures, but it's all in a day of these kids' lives.I loved the characters and every single actor from very young to adult did a phenomenal job, especially the title characters, the two older rival girls and probably my favorite character: the cool party host, Soren played by Izaac Wang. He's 11, but looks much younger and had me rolling with his constant smirks and nods of approval in the foreground and especially background.While I laughed all the way throughout - barely a scene I didn't laugh in or cherish due to its authenticity, the climax had everyone in my movie theatre row laughing so hard, we were in tears, or at least I was. I haven't laughed that hard in one scene of a movie in a very long time and it was refreshing. Truthfully, the movie's already very good, but that ending elevated this tremendously.Obviously, this isn't for kids and the trailer should NOT be seen beforehand. Boy did that ruin so many of the jokes. (I've always hated spoiling trailers.) Those are the only two rules.Well, one more: See and enjoy the blank out of this.***Final thoughts: All the way throughout, I swore up and down the lead boy, Jacob Tremblay, was one of my favorite actresses, Vera Farmiga's offspring. He looked so much like her, it was uncanny. I was wrong, but dang, that was distracting me.",Good Boys

9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The boys are back in town.,6,18 August 2019,"Ostensibly, 'Good Boys (2019)' is a one-joke film: little kids swear while misunderstanding sex. However, the movie manages to transcend this simplicity. It feels like a much more innocent version of 'Superbad (2007)', one in which the boys just want to be accepted by their peers, kiss a girl and get along with one another. There's a lot of swearing, sure, but the intent isn't 'seedy'; the kids really just feel like kids, albeit kids caught up in a relatively ridiculous adventure. Though most of the narrative feels as though it's comprised a series of extended skits, the finale manages to tie everything together in a surprisingly satisfying and, ultimately, rather mature way. It ends up as a more-than-decent coming-of-age story, which adds a layer of depth to the initially one-note-seeming proceedings. It's not like the nuts-and-boys stuff is ever subpar, either. In fact, the flick is usually quite entertaining and is often amusing, if not hilarious. The three leads are likeable, portrayed pretty well by the young actors, and the pacing is fast. There are some jokes that don't land and the first third isn't anything more than, I suppose, 'quaint', but the picture gets moving as it enters its second act and its generally good vibe creates an enjoyable viewing experience. Basically, you go along for an amiable ride that's a little heightened but always has its heart in the right place. 6/10",Good Boys
10,ThomasDrufke,One of the Funniest Films of the Year,8,29 August 2019,"Being able to balance gross out raunchy humor with a heartfelt story about growing apart from friends is certainly a heavy task. But director Gene Stupnisky, writer Lee Eisenberg, and producer Seth Rogen certainly do a fantastic job here. 3 likable young leads who are likely going to have long and successful careers, a script that never gives you a break to catch your breath from laughing, and a message that can ring true to anyone in the audience, Good Boys is one of the best films of the summer, and may be the funniest film of the year thus far. Sure, the trailer shows a good chunk of the gags but it still succeeded in making me laugh even when I saw them coming.8.0/10",Good Boys
11,Cineanalyst,Indecently Hackneyed,4,13 December 2019,"In ""Good Boys"" three preadolescent boys have a series of misadventures involving foul language, drugs, misuse of sex toys and such dangerous activities as running across a freeway and causing a series of car crashes. What's indecent about the movie, however, is that it's utterly formulaic. Seen ""Superbad"" (2007)? ""Booksmart"" (2019)? Well, here it is again--repacked with tweens. Naturally, the likes of Evan Goldberg, Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen are credited as producers. These dudes and other Judd Apatow disciples keep making the same garbage blend of sentimentalism and dick jokes. The irony is that this is another reworking of the coming-of-age narrative, but these guys never grow up--at least, their movies don't. They're like children who frequently curse or otherwise act provocatively because they got a rise out of someone once, but they're too juvenile to realize how easily tiresome such humor becomes. If not a coming-of-age teenage party flick (this time, a kissing party rather than the drug and sex ones for older kids), it's a rom-com or raunchy sex comedy--all abiding by the same clichés. There are high jinks, despite whatever protests from wet blankets, revolving around some obstacle; the friends or lovers break up; and, then, reunite in some fashion.The one new thing someone seems to have discovered this outing is the play-within-the-play, which here is presented as an equally-inappropriate musical as portrayed by children, ""Rock of Ages,"" about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Plays-within-plays have been around since at least the era of Shakespeare, but I guess it's good the boys are trying something new for a change.",Good Boys
12,The-Sarkologist,"A film about kids, not for kids",8,27 September 2019,"There was a suggestion in the trailer that the boys who starred in the film weren't actually allowed to watch the film, and to be quite honest, I'm not at all surprised. In fact, I sort of wonder to what extent these boys actually knew what was going on when the movie was being filmed, namely because the genius of the film is that these boys are in 6th Grade, and a lot of the humour would so go over their head that actually playing that up is what makes this film so great.Yeah, this film is certainly not a children's film, and when I saw Seth Rogan's name in the credits, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. Let me say that I was certainly not disappointed at all. In fact, it was one of the funniest movies that I have seen this year, and that probably does say a lot about my sense of humour, which probably does put me at odds with that fact that I am also a regular churchgoer.The film is about three boys who are invited to a 'kissing' party. Well, they don't know how to kiss, so they decide to try to find out, and knowing that the neighbour has a boyfriend, they decide to use the drone to attempt to find out. Well, unfortunately, the drone gets captured, and later destroyed, and since the father gave explicit instructions not to touch the drone, they suddenly find themselves on a quest to get a new one. Oh, and also, the girls who took the drone, well, the boys managed to take some of their drugs, and are holding them to ransom over it.Honestly, this film is hilarious. Sure, it is pretty crude, but the fact that a lot of the jokes come down to how so much goes over the boy's heads, it works, and it works really well. In many cases, it is not so much the crudity of the film that makes it funny, but we are actually laughing at ourselves, how when we were their ages, there was an awful lot that we didn't know, or didn't get. It is so much the case here.Yet, it is also one of those films about growing up. Sure, it is not necessarily a coming of age film, but in a way it is. Things have changed so much over the years, but it is taking us back to a time when we were going from being children to being teenagers. In a way, we are on the cusp of some major changes in our lives, and we are only just beginning to discover the things about the adult world. Yet we are still in a world where travelling four miles is going way out of our comfort zone, and our friends are friends namely because we live near each other.Yeah, this is a great film, and in another way, it is a film that takes us back to our childhood, and in a way reminds us of how innocent we really were.",Good Boys
13,UniqueParticle,Uproariously hilarious throughout - I think I laughed the most in the audience!,9,21 August 2019,"It's important to note this movie is very very inappropriate and not for everyone! I loved almost everything about it on top of having a rough time in my life this really uplifted my spirits no matter what anyone thinks it's definitely worth a chance.

14,cruise01,Hilarious and dumb fun.,8,14 November 2019,"Good Boys (4 out of 5 stars).Good Boys is a raunchy comedy film that takes the basic concept like Superbad but twisting it around focusing it on three 6th grader boys who are going through so much trouble just so they can play the kissing game at a party. The film is filled with dirty, adolescent teenage boys humor, and the jokes never stop.The plot is fun. Three 6th grader boys spy on their neighbor with a drone. Only to get it taken away from their neighbor. They steal her purse which has drugs in it. It comes down to a cat and mouse with the three boys and two older teenager girls.The film is filled with lots of dirty jokes, raunchy humor, and lots of kids using language. The movie is not for the sensitive audience. It is what you can expect with this kind of movie. Its like Superbad but with 6th graders.The cast is great. The three child actors Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams, and Brady Noon are all great with their characters. The script and direction moves at a fast pace. The film has a coming of age story about three close friends that do everything together. Even if they want to go on their own to do there own thing. One kid wants to date. One kid wants to help out with the community. And the other wants to be in a musical. They come to a learning curve. They get chased around by two teen girls who are desperate for their drugs back. They get involved in buying drugs from a college frat house. All while, they are trying to get their drone back. And maybe go to a kids party to play a kissing game.Overall, Good Boys is a good comedy film. I enjoyed it. It had plenty of fun humor and laughs throughout. The plot has a coming of age story while being in familiar territory with another comedy movie.",Good Boys
15,eddie_baggins,The Beanbag Boys make for a solid if forgettable comedy romp,6,30 September 2019,"The good boys gone bad/caught in a bad situation sub-genre of comedy is nothing new but thanks to a likeable collection of young stars and some solid laughs, the Seth Rogen backed Good Boys is an enjoyable comedic romp that showcases the doom and gloom around big screen comedies is far from correct.Becoming a sleeper hit in the United States, debut feature director Gene Stupnitsky's well reviewed un-pc comedy that follows ""The Beanbag Boys"" Max, Lucas and Thor as the newly minted 6 graders start to deal with their new tween lives filled with the opposite sex, pressures and changing friendships, is not ground-breaking stuff but there's enough heart, soul and outlandish situations here too ensure audiences will enjoy their brief time in the lives of these childhood friends.From selling rare fantasy cards to questionable buyers like Peter Pan69, enacting out kissing practice on suspect looking CPR dolls or entering into college frat houses, the quest the Beanbag Boys take us on is over the top and not dissimilar to granddaddy of this type of film Superbad and while it doesn't quite land the way in which that particular classic does, these colourful characters make for kind-hearted and likeable protagonists as their goal to attend a kissing party goes far from smoothly.If you were too tell me a few years ago that the loveable kid from Room would be appearing in a cuss-laden and innuendo filled adult comedy wearing a gimp mask I would've thought you were all types of crazy but Jacob Tremblay expertly leads his co-stars Keith L. Williams and Brady Noon across Stupnitsky's wild ride as his lady focused Max helps steer Williams worry-wort Lucas and Noon's attitude filled Thor into some outlandish situations in the name of first love.Not all jokes in the crews repertoire works throughout, with Lucas's over the top antics in particular grating after the first hour or so while the films bare bones plot line that doesn't even pretend to be realistic takes us too some places that didn't really need to be on the destination list but even when the film tries a little too hard to make those big life statements and the mawkish nature of friendship lessons take hold, you still can't help but be glad you've got to spend some good quality time with a bunch of soon to be teenagers who whether you'd like to admit or not, will remind you of yourself in this time of our your life, for better or worse.In an age where the female lead comedy or the man-child filled bromance comedies are the hot property in Hollywood, Good Boys focus on the awkward tweenage years brings something fresh to the table, that while certainly not appropriate for the age group it represents, offers up everyone else a comedy that feels both fresh and familiar, enjoyable without ever threatening to become overly memorable.Final Say -Equal amounts offensive and likeable, Good Boys is a wickedly fun comedic exercise that while not achieving any great lasting successes, succeeds in its goal of making us laugh at some seriously awkward kids getting caught in some equally awkward situations.3 Gandalf lookalikes out of 5",Good Boys

17,paul-allaer,"""Beanbag Boys for life"": 6th graders rule!",7,24 August 2019,"""Good Boys"" (2018 release; 89 min.) brings the story of 6th graders Max, Lucas and Thor. As the movie opens, Max is looking at things om his computer that he wouldn't want his dad to walk in on. Dad promptly walks in... We then get to know the boys better, as they are hanging out at school and elsewhere, trying to fit in and be cool. Then Max, who has a crush on his classmate Brixlee, snags an unexpected invite to a party, and not just any party, a kissing party, and Brixlee will be there! But max doesn't know how to kiss... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directorial debut of Gene Stupnitsky, who also co-wrote this with Lee Eisenberg. They are both long-time TV comedy writers (""The Office"", etc.). Equally important, Seth Rogen co-produced this and has his fingers all over this one. The plot, such as it is, is merely an excuse to come up with situations where the 6th graders are in way over their heads, and being crude and funny at the same time. So yes, it's a 6th grader sex comedy. I actually found myself laughing at all of it regularly, because it is so over the top and frankly impossible. The three leads are terrific (Brady Noon (as Thor) reminded me of The Wonder Years' Fred Savage. But it must also be said that nothing in this movie will leave a lasting impression, unlike another grade movie, last year's outstanding ""Eighth Grade"".""Good Boys"" premiered at this year's SXSW, to good acclaim, and opened wide last weekend in line with box office expectations. It is not in its second weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati in a medium-sized theater was attended okay but not great. I think that there is a limited audience for hard R rated comedies like ""Good Boys"". If you like previous movies like it (think ""Superbad"" etc. or are a fan of Seth Rogen's comedies, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Good Boys

19,jtindahouse,So refreshing to see a movie like this being made and being good,7,5 April 2020,"I love that we are at a point in humanity where a film like 'Good Boys' can be made. People (with a few unfortunate exceptions) are becoming less uppish and prudish and realising that things like swearing are just an expression of language and nothing more. It might sound weird, but to hear kids swearing so freely was extremely refreshing. This film wouldn't have worked with anything less than an R rating. Of that I have no doubt.The three lead kids are fantastic in this film. They all played their parts superbly, but my pick of the bunch would have to be Keith L. Williams. I had never heard of the kid before now, but he is hilarious. He had far and away the most funny lines and even managed to turn some that wouldn't otherwise have been funny into something hysterical. There's always a risk with child actors that they will come across annoyingly, but that isn't the case here by any means. These are very watchable kids.Probably the only thing holding the movie back was a lack of funny adults for the kids to play off. Stephen Merchant had a great scene where he stole the show, and that was what I wanted more of. It doesn't have to take away from the kids being the star of the film, it just gives them more variety to work with. At the end of the day though I had a really good time with 'Good Boys', and in a world that is lacking quality comedies at the moment, this was a welcome surprise.",Good Boys

And has I sat through this movie I found myself very entertained by it, the film proved to be an enjoyable misadventure after another. It never goes to overboard with the raunchiness, I believe it was cause the boys age, and the foul mouth dialogue said by boys in the movie has a funny realism to it unlike Role Models which was intent on shock value.The boys make you forget there child actors and they feel real friends, and at no point they never come across has annoying, you simply enjoy and root for them all the way.

Trust me, if it was a really deep film, I'd be giving it 1 star out of 10 for false advertisement reasons alone.It was still sufficiently raunchy, low brow, and vulgar enough to entertain as advertised. It was as advertised.But, it also had a cuter more innocent story that went along with the sleazy hysterical humor. A story that is actually kind of moving given what you are watching. A story that is actually very moving given how it was advertised... given the genre that it was in... given the highly offensive humor that MOST of us absolutely love.And whomever edited it, had their head on their shoulders.

This movie is directed by Gene Stupnitsky in his directorial debut and stars Brady Noon (Boardwalk Empire), Lil Rel Howery (Get Out), Jacob Tremblay (Before I Wake), Will Forte (MacGruder) and Keith L.

24,stevendbeard,Tween Version of Superbad,8,17 August 2019,"I saw ""Good Boys"", starring Jacob Tremblay-The Predator_2018, Wonder; Keith L. Williams-The Last Man on Earth_tv, Teachers_tv; Brady Noon-this is his first movie but he was in Boardwalk Empire_tv and Will Forte-The Last Man on Earth_tv, MacGruber.
This is an 'R' rated comedy-do not bring the little kiddies to this one, and I saw people that did just that-that is filled with hilarious situations, mostly due to the naivete of the 3 kid stars. It kind of reminded me of a tween version of Superbad. Jacob, Keith and Brady are the tweens and they are long time friends-long time to them anyway-since they were in kindergarten. Will plays Jacob's father. Sixth grader Jacob is invited to his first kissing party-he or his two friends have never even kissed a girl before-and they are on a mission to learn all they can about kissing girls before they attend the party. Along the way, they get involved with computer porn, teenage girls, stolen drugs and college drug dealers. It is hilarious through out the movie, mostly because of the tweens not understanding things. Like most kids their age, they are filled with a lot of misinformation, mostly from other kids their own age. One of my favorite scenes-it's in the trailers so I'm not giving anything away-is when the 3 kids are talking about learning to kiss. One says, 'We can watch my neighbor, she is a nymphomaniac!' Another says, 'She starts fires?' The first one says,'No, it means that she can have sex on land or sea!'
It's rated ""R"" for drug material, alcohol use, language, lots & lots of language and sexual content-no nudity-all involving tweens and has a running time of 1 hour & 29 minutes.

However, GOOD BOYS proves that not all sources of film terror must involve humanoid creatures. The plot of GOOD BOYS revolves around the so-called ""child-proof"" pill bottle. Neither ""Bean Bag Boy Max"" nor his buddy ""Thor""--or even the largest Triple B Tyke, ""Lucas""--has any success in prying off the kid-resistant top of a chewable multi-vitamin bottle at several key turning points during GOOD BOYS. Being not too far removed from similar frustrations myself, it was easy for me to empathize with how Big Pharmaceuticals are stifling America's Youth. Certainly many promising lads devolve into 79-pound weaklings as days turn into months of not being able to ingest their vital childhood booster pills. Sadly, many of us also are losing our grandparents, as they, too, succumb to the Evil of ""Child-Proof"" packaging. GOOD BOYS, therefore, will curdle your blood in the face of crass, counter-productive kid-stunting packaging!",Good Boys

30,sauravjoshi85,Surprisingly Entertaining movie.,7,10 February 2021,"Good Boy is a comedy movie directed by Gene Stupnitsky and stars Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams, Brady Noon, Molly Gordonand Midori Francis.A hilarious yet goofy movie which might raise an eyebrow of moral policies as lots of verbal vulgarity is been depicted in the movie and considering the age of the boys this might disturbs some but overall an entertaining movie despite of some goofs which can be ignored.The movie revolves around the life of three kids who are now breaking limits as they consider themselves too big to be called kids as they are on their brink of puberty and they wanted to attend a kiss party and faces some unusual challenges.The acting in the movie is good and a stupendous work is done by all the three lead kids. Direction is good and screenplay is crisp. Music is loud and suits the plot of the movie.Over all this movie is primarily focuses on the life of three growing kids but this movie is surely not a kids movie and is being made targeting adult viewers, so I without debating on the moral judgement of the movie I would recommend to just watch this surprisingly entertaining movie.",Good Boys

A trio of boys have entered the sixth grade where they vow to get a girlfriend, perform the lead in the school's musical or live life by a set of ""rules."" Of course reaching those goals they have to endure a series of outlandish adventures which will set them on the path of ruination or at least sidelines littered w/tough life lessons. Generally amusing but of the variety where clearly intelligent boys tend to drift towards cinematic stupidity for the sake of making us laugh kind of takes the novelty away from seeing youthful mirth-makers engage in conversations regarding nymphomaniacs, kissing or sipping the appropriate amount of beer but since the production is not mean spirited, we forgive the antics as they unfold on screen.",Good Boys
34,aidanratesmovies,"Funny, and enjoyable although definitely not perfect",8,28 April 2020,"Entertaining, ridiculous, but most of the time very funny- Good Boys may not be a perfect coming of age comedy, but it certainly is an enjoyable one. The film is largely inspired by, and somewhat imitates the like of Superbad with its story, but watching the film itself it feels very unique and in charge of its own devices. The main 3 kids all give decent performances, notably Trembley who is always the best out of any kid performance in a film that he is in. The film does struggle with finding its balance of tone and atmosphere from time to time, not entirely settling on either side of the extremes that it hopes to cover. Nevertheless, more often than not the film is incredibly entertaining, and very funny as well, which is of course what I hope to expect from comedies, and yet very few provide it as well as this one does nowadays. The music does seem to be a bit too forced at times, as well as some of the structural elements to keep the plot going, but if you can turn your brain off enough and just enjoy the ride, Good Boys is certainly a film fit for you. The film can also be surprisingly heartfelt at times, which is a nice change of pace. It struggles with trying to do so a bit at its first attempts, but by the end, it wins your heart over in a way I didn't expect. In the end, Good Boys is a funny, but imperfect, comedy that is more enjoyable than not and has a suprsingly amount of heart left over after its laughs.

35,questl-18592,Good Boys. Bad Effort.,3,24 August 2019,"The title says it all. There's nothing really to this movie until the end. For the vast majority of the movie it's your typical frat, stoner, crude comedy with the only real difference being that the leads are in 6th grade. If that style of comedy is your thing, you're in luck! Good Boys hits all the notes you would expect and hits all the predictable beats that you would find in most of these comedies.Unfortunately, the fact that it's kids delivering the lines is often to the movie's detriment. Perhaps it's just a result of the child acting bar being raised by the likes of such popular media as Stranger Things and It, but these boys are bad and the rest of the cast plays at about the same level. The timing and delivery is all off and there's never any real believability to the performances.That said, there were a couple laughs and the ending did go in a less predictable way than expected so it's not a complete disaster but it definitely doesn't warrant a trip to the theater, just wait for it to hit TV or some other, less expensive medium.",Good Boys

Recommendations from friends , movie podcast reviews , trailers I've seen or Twitter comments but for the life of me i cant remember why i put this is on my list. It's not the kind of film i seek out normally but i'm really pleased i did despite being warned off by more than one person !Invited to his first kissing party, 12-year-old Max asks his best friends Lucas and Thor for some much-needed help on how to pucker up. When they hit a dead end, Max decides to use his father's drone to spy on the teenage girls next door. When the boys lose the drone, they skip school and hatch a plan to retrieve it before Max's dad can figure out what happened.Imagine a parallel universe where the characters in Superbad go back in time and join the cast of The Wonder years and you are somewhere near what Good Boys is all about.
It's crude but in an charming sort of way . The whole premise of the comedy is that the kids don't get the crudeness of whats going on around them and that's what gets the laughs.
I wanted to dislike the cast ( as i do with most comedies with kids in) but it's almost impossible to .
The star of the movie for me is Keith L Williams who plays Lucas . His inability to tell lies gives him the best lines and he had me laughing out loud several times.
It suffers a little bit from over sentimentality at the end but it didnt ruin it for me.Bean Bag Boys for life!",Good Boys

Looking back at the movie, this was a tall order to try to succeed in putting adult scenarios in the hands of kids. Yet, Good Boys accomplished this at times for me in the art of representing life in such a young cast. The film has the comedy pace, keeping things moving quickly, and managing to take time to flesh out the characters. It's surprisingly tasteful at times and wrapped in a cute atmosphere as the naivety of the three boys manages to dull the blow that comes with the adult themes in this movie, which worked for me in terms of adding a new spin to freshen things up. In addition, the film manages to accomplish a story telling element that does not involve just getting drunk or stoned, but instead adding that kid perspective to the mix to help keep things ground and allow the laughs to keep coming. If you have read my reviews, you also know I'm big on character utilization and surprisingly the Good Boys writers again succeeded in using the three young musketeers evenly. There is good development of each member, enough differences for them to stand out, but have that similarity that friends seem to have. The kids manage to sell that relationship and their acting is great as they capture the spirit of the awkward middle school friends trying to find their way in a new setting, or settings in this case. As such, I give them props for being able to make a relatable tale, managing to capture the nuances of life in this youthful setting, and in a way that helped grip me and some of the audience into the ridiculousness at hand. But you are really asking is it funny, after all it's a comedy and it needs to be funny. Well at times the writing is dead on with timing, design, and delivery to make me laugh hard. A few of my fellow audience members were unable to stop laughing, enjoying the Seth Rogen like comedy spewing from a smaller frame at a higher decibel. If you like the comedies of Superbad, Knocked Up, and This is the End, then I have a feeling you are going to love the formula they used in this movie once more.That being said, there are a few things of this movie that did not quite impress me as some others in the audience. For one thing, despite the story actually being in this film and grounding, there is a little predictability thrown in that did not impress me. Relevant as it was, the typical plot falls left me a little bored, waiting for either unique comedy or a deep scene to save me from the chaotic adventure. And while I got some magic moments that were golden in terms of timing, character development and delivery, there are other times where the comedy genre writing took over. Good Boys still suffers from excessive cursing, which although funny out of the lips of a child, is still not my favorite thing to watch and not the most unique writing component. At times I felt the comedy forced, or the lines pushed a little too much on me, in an attempt to squeeze that last bit of crude and crass out for shock factor or a simple laugh. Other times, I felt some of the comedy was a little too aggressive or over the line for me, mainly in the form of drug or sex humor that skirted under the trailer radar. This brings me to probably the sour note in the film, the over abundant advertising that really gave many of the big scenes away. I agree with others there is a treasure lying in wait for the adventurer to go to the theater, but some major elements have already been effectively beaten to death if you watch the trailers enough. The convenient store scene, the swing scene, and the teenage girl scenes I knew were coming and left me feeling bored after how much I had already seen them.The VERDICT:Good boys turned out to be better than I anticipated, managing to ground a relatable story as the foundation and building the comedy around. It's pace, charm, and cuteness from the sensational actors is that factor the R rated comedy needed and those aspects will bring much of the laughs. Throw in the deeper elements to help tone the aggressive edge down and my fellow audience members are correct in saying it's a nice, versatile picture. However, it still suffers from over aggressive cursing, lazier writing to fill in moments between the more aggressive styles, and worst of all, big scenes already presented frame by frame in the commercials. Still all in all, this film is fun, though I'm not quite certain this one is the most theater worthy film, and may remain a better home viewing picture.My scores are:Adventure/Comedy: 8.0

Williams, Molly Gordon, Midori Francis, Clarence Hurstfield, Josh Caras, Stephen Merchant, Macie Juiles, Lil Rel Howery, Retta, Will Forte, Izaac Wang, Sam Richardson, Millie Davis. (R)A trio of sixth-graders who call themselves the Bean Bag Boys (Tremblay, Noon, Williams) are invited to a ""kissing party"" with other classmates; cue the long, shenanigan-filled day where they learn lessons and escape danger at every turn. Rowdy raunch among the tween-set, the film has that appealing mix of humor and heart, but ultimately has little to say and the laughs are inconsistent; there's little variety to the one-joke proposition--pre-adolescents frankly (and profanely) discussing mature topics with little understanding--and there are a number of episodes that abandon reality for the sake of cheap gags (a frat house fracas springs to mind). Still, there are enough gut-busting lines scattered throughout to warrant interest, with Williams displaying crack comedic timing while stealing scenes at every opportunity. Forte has a small role as Tremblay's dad, a very similar role to the one he played in the other 2019 offering that transparently echoed ""Superbad"" (""Booksmart""); Gordon also appears in both films.63/100",Good Boys

43,arungeorge13,A movie about kids that cannot be watched by kids! [+47%],5,3 November 2019,"Short Review: The comedy in Good Boys ranges from innocent to sexually explicit to slapstick. Well, that's necessarily not a bad thing. But it tries too damn hard to be the kiddie version of 'Superbad'. What we get is an extremely raunchy, definitely-not-for-kids comedy (starring three kids in the lead) that goes overboard on many an occasion. Look, I get it that whatever plays out in the movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously but there isn't any of the inventiveness here that we saw in a film like 'Superbad'. Just look at the Mclovin scene for instance - that's a gag you'll remember for a lifetime. In Good Boys, unfortunately, you won't come across anything that memorable.The best scenes in this R-rated comedy come when it's not trying to flaunt its 'R-rated'-ness. The highway-crossing scene can be taken as a good example. It was simply laugh-out-loud funny and did not have to resort to gimmicks to make the audience laugh. This film needed more along those lines. I also particularly enjoyed the scene in the supermarket where the trio run into a cop. That scene felt straight out of a typical Seth Rogen flick even with the manhood-size joke at the centre of it.But for what it is, the film does manage to entertain amid all the chaotic proceedings. At 90 minutes, it's also not the most difficult film to sit through. The casting choices (Tremblay, Williams, and Noon) are spot-on. The writers bothered to impart each member of the 'Bean Bag Boys' with individual traits and goals. It was interesting to an extent to see how they'd work their whole deal out without breaking up or hating on each other. That it went the 'friendship-message' route (in the end) was pretty clichéd and predictable. The joke's probably on the audience to be expecting more than that!",Good Boys

46,Troy_Campbell,Crass and cheap - but hilarious!,7,14 September 2019,"Produced by Seth Rogen's band of merry men, this vulgar comedy is basically Superbad but with a trio of pre-pubescent boys instead of high schoolers. It's cheap, crude and not particularly clever, but also, at times, bloody hilarious. There's a simple formula for laughs here: three best friends who have just started Middle School (Year 6) embark on a series of adventures thinking they're ready for all the important adult stuff in life like kissing, sipping beer and swearing like convicted felons. Adopting a quantity-over-quality approach to humour, the gags come thick and fast. Inadvertent operation of sex toys, a frat house brawl, an inappropriate Rock of Ages concert, a too-soon experience with porn - everything is thrown at the screen in pursuit of a laugh. Although I wouldn't go as far to say the script is intelligent or original, there are some wittier, more subtle moments of amusement that rely on genuine comedic timing (misused vocab, social unacceptable behaviour) from the youthful leads, and they largely pull it off. Child actors are often hit or miss, skirting a fine line between endearingly precocious and unbearably irritating; however, the headlining trio here land on the right side of childish. They think they know it all of course but are still most definitely ""social piranhas."" Make no mistake, the creators of Good Boys employ a simple and crass method to generate comedy. They succeeded.",Good Boys

Otherwise, the movie wouldn't be any different to Superbad or Role Models, in terms of the types of jokes and humor.But this is a complete fail. The little kids forced inconsistencies scene to scene. In one, the kids were typical teenagers, and the next one dumb movie infants. It just didn't work.Also, the characters were a combination of the worse parts of both worlds. As annoying and insufferable as young teens can be and as idiotic and insufferable little kids can be. So, fail. Talented fail.",Good Boys
51,aciessi,Past Your Bedtime.,6,16 August 2019,"If you came for Superbad Jr., that's what you're getting. A fitfully funny, raunchy, gross comedy featuring middle school prototypes of the bad boys from Superbad. For a lack of a better term, Good Boys has a playground to explore the tropes of tween life, and twisting them into comedy gold. At times, the movie goes for it and the jokes land very well. The more ballsier the joke, the more fun it is to watch. Plenty of ""Oh My God"" moments, especially in the opening half-hour. But in other times, there's much to be desired. The sentimental message at the end really didn't work for me at all. It smudges the entire purpose of what we are watching. If the premise is to have pre-pubescent children get into outlandishly adult situations, just pound your foot on that comedy gas pedal and never pull back. Good Boys isn't brave enough to go that distance, but it isn't cowardly enough to avoid it's share of moments either. In the end, it's filled with enough laughs for a good time at the movies, but it shows the flaws of comedy in 2019, and why it makes sense that industry comedy movies are not flooding the box-office like they used to. McLovin', I miss you.",Good Boys
52,rockman182,Good Boys (2019),7,16 August 2019,"I liked the R band trailer for this film. It was genuinely funny. Also, the fact that so much adult humor was coming from young kids who don't know what all these adult things are, made it even funnier. This looked like Superbad but at a younger level and its still just as raunchy and profane as you would expect it to be. Good Boys was a fun time, its actually what you expect. Its a very adult themed coming of age film between three friends who have to deal with growing up.The film is about three best friends who get invited to a ""kissing party"" at a popular kids house. The trio want to learn how to kiss so they use one of the kid's fathers drone to spy on their neighbor who they believe is a good kisser. Things go haywire and the drone gets destroyed therefore the trio go on an adventure to get the drone replaced and make the party in time. Along the way they find out about growing up and trying to be more ""adult"" to please the cool kids. They also realize that growing up impinges on a friendship they thought would last forever.I thought the film was as funny as the previews advertised. The trio of child actors are great and have good chemistry. Their delivery makes the film really work and the script matches the actor's level of commitment. I, and many in the theater burst out laughing. It goes through the usual coming of age film motions so its not a very original effort. However, its a well made film in this genre and is something I feel can be revisited when needed because its watchable.I think the biggest mystery amidst all this is how Jacob Tremblay never seems to age and how he looks the same age that he did in Room. There's sweet messages below the profane and crude exterior, messages about friendship, growing up, and being yourself amidst peer pressure. The intentions of the film turn out to be great. I had fun with this and I get the feeling many else will as well.7/10",Good Boys
53,RforFilm,A raunchy movie like Good Boys should have been even naughtier. This still feels too sanitized to be edgy,5,28 August 2019,"You know what we've haven't gotten in a while? A raunchy comedy. Raunchy comedies seemed to have token a leave of absence in the wake of very safe, sitcom like comedies. Don't get me wrong; some of them like Tag and Crazy Rich Asians can still get a lot of laughs. But what I want are the ones that are non-apologetic and are willing to show that people are capable of being bad, even when they don't want to. That doesn't make them unlikable (that takes a bad script for that to happen), but that shows that even with those faults, the characters are only stronger when they come out triumphant.We seem to forget that raunchy comedies used to come out all the time. Movies like Animal House, Caddyshack, Dumb & Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Knocked Up, and Superbad were unafraid to show characters that not only were not afraid to have...gross features, but were also unafraid to make them more then willing to sleep with any women and call them unflattering names. We see a lot of adult stories in these situations, but it's understandable why kids are rarely given this treatment. Lets see some bad kids in the ironically titled Good Boys.Best friends Max (played by Jacob Tremblay), Lucas (played by Keith L. Williams) and Thor (played by Brady Noon) are just starting sixth graders that are starting to notice girls and understand that the other kids see them as losers. Max gets an opportunity to attend a party where along with being able to hang out with the cool group, also has a chance to kiss his crush Brixlee. He also gets an invite for Lucas and Thor. They all agree that this is their chance to show that their just as adult as the cool kids.Trouble arises when in an attempt to learn about kissing by spying on their neighbor Hannah. The drone they use is captured and in an attempt to get it back, they accidentally steal her ecstasy. The kids, being good natured, don't want to return her the drugs, so they try to figure a way to get it back or possibly buy a new one. Their journey causes them to skip school, run across a highway and even sneak into a frat house. As the boys try to get to their party, they start to understand they have different definitions of being ""popular"" and may be growing apart.Good Boys is a movie I've always expected to happen; by taking middle school boys and putting them in a hard R rated comedy. It clearly wants to be as memorable as Goonies, The Sandlot and The Monster Squad. The problem is that not only is it only funny in parts, but the movie I expected was supposed to be a lot racier and crazy. That's not to say I wanted insane ideas that would have been too far, but I believe comedy is all about showcasing elements people don't understand about their environment. With middle school kids, that should have opened this up further.What does work are the three kids and their relationship in general. I like how they constantly talk about girls and try to bring each other into their worlds. Childhood is about realizing that there isn't enough room to make everyone happy and responding to that. This movie understands that any boy is going to be upset when one wants to sing while another would rather be with his crush. In fact, I wonder if this movie might have been better if it were made as a drama.When it is a comedy...what we get is another rehash of Superbad (Booksmart also did the same thing) where the goal is getting to a party. Is this the only thing people care about? There's a side plot of one of the boys staring in a musical and that a lone could have been a raunchy comedy. One of the others is going through his parents divorce and that could also be very funny. The jokes still feel too safe and polished to represent how boys really talk. As I said, there were laughs; just not a lot of them.I'll give this five drones out of ten. There's an audience that will be satisfied with Good Boys. Who that is will be anyone's guess. It's too inappropriate for kids under 12 and I think adults will still find it too sanitized. It's ironically a lot like a lot of family comedies that have the same problem. If you saw the trailers and thought, ""This looks hilarious!"" you'll probably get a chuckle or two. But I expect my bad boys to be even naughtier.",Good Boys

55,witster18,I guess its eye of beholder stuff - because on paper this looked right up my alley,5,7 February 2020,"I love coming of age, i love childhood adventure, AND I love raunchy comedy, but for me, this fell short.It has some funny moments and lines, no doubt, but overall its an unfocused, sloppy mess of a story, with average execution both behind and in front of the camera. I wanted to love this.I guess it was hard for me to balance the raunch with the naïveté that, as a viewer, I was expected to just be fine-with.The storyline has so many meaningless and nonesensical moments, And the film is completely emotionless, even for the genre.Superbad is a great comparision simply because ITs great, and imo, shows how to make a stupid storyline work. It does it with great characters, and keeping an emotional connection between them, and by bolstering it all with superb comedic performances. This film, in a nutshell, lacks 90% of that. It's not quite as disappointing for me in terms of 'boy i wanna see that because its up my alley' as say ""Take Me Home Tonight"", but it's disappointing nonetheless, and i could really care less about the raunchiness. While I didnt at all care about the raunchiness - I did take a little offense to the fact that the best meaningless storyline they could come up with for this otherwise genius plan to make a clever, younger demographic raunch comedy(which somebody needs to do right now), i DID take some offense with the fact they chose a storyline about the kids being around, purchasing, and flirting with death with illegal, lethal drugs. It was just like,""boy cant they come up with something better and still be raunchy, surely"".A late crying scene is another complete miss, and really ecapsulates why this all doesn't work, trying to mirror Superbad's strength, and failing in both impact and performance, miserably.I've never said anything like this before, but I'll say it... I wish someone would throw ME 25million to get another crack at this and do it right.I laughed 8-10 times at some funny lines - that's the best thing I can think of to say about this movie.I wish we had the performances of Superbad, the naïveté and overall quality if ""Dope"", and I would have been fine with the raunchiness and lines to make it original and funny.

57,ofpsmith,I'll admit that some incredibly mixed emotions flowed throughout the film.,7,21 August 2019,"I really like that these kinds of movies are being made again. Stranger Things (I know that that's a TV show), It, Shazam, and this. The kind of '80s kids movies that half the time aren't really for kids. Good Boys is definitely in the vein of that but most of the jokes are something akin to Superbad but with middle school kids. In my view this works to both the movie's advantage and detriment. Before I go any further I'll just point out that the movie was funny. Really funny as a matter of fact. The mixed feelings come from some of the jokes that I found cringeworthy mainly because children were involved. I knew that this was rated R (kind of like Stand by Me) and that they'd say the F word, drink illicitly, and stuff like that but the point remains. But apart from that I really enjoyed it. I especially liked how they humanized the teenage ""bullies."" They didn't really need to do that but they did and even though it's a relatively small part of the film it worked for the better. If you can take something like South Park perfectly fine than there's no reason you wouldn't like this.",Good Boys
58,kjproulx,A Solid Comedy. Good for Some Great Laughs.,7,21 August 2019,"Nowadays, good mainstream comedies are very hard to come by. It seems like fewer and fewer are released each year. Since the year 2000, I would argue that the last recent comedy that will go down as a classic was 2009s The Hangover. Yes, we have received great comedies like Bridesmaids, 21 Jump Street, and even Horrible Bosses to name a few, but none of those truly feel like they will be talked about by a wide audience in about 20 to 30 years. While Good Boys isn't worthy of that discussion either, I would absolutely say that it comes the closest out of any film that has come out this year.Trying to make it to a party, Good Boys follows three young boys as they raunchily go about their day, discovering new things, cursing like crazy, being wrapped up in a stolen drug plot, and being chased by older girls. These kids find themselves in one ridiculous scenario after another, which makes for a very entertaining time at the movies. You don't go to movies like this hoping that it will be dramatically resonant with the audience, but it's always nice to see a comedy take the time to add that extra layer, and Good Boys definitely does that.Jacob Tremblay has the most screentime here and he is fantastic as always. Since his appearance in the film Room, I have and will always continue to follow his career. He is a ridiculously talented young actor. Setting him aside for a minute, I would like to shed light on Keith L. Williams and Brady Noon who play his best friends, or how they refer to themselves, ""The Bean Bag Boys."" They have done work in television and film, but nothing that I ever recall seeing. With that said, there are multiple occasions where they steal the show and prove they're worthy of long-running careers in comedy as well, at least for now.Now to comment/criticize the main type of comedy this film always goes for, which is the constant profanity, sex jokes, and adult-oriented humour. Good Boys is the type of film that feels like it's trying to capture the exact same vibe as Superbad, but replacing actual young adults with little kids. Personally, I found this aspect to be very effective, but the screenplay definitely took liberties in the fact that they have so much knowledge about certain things. I can see many viewers being turned off by the actions these characters take throughout the movie, but it worked for me, and let's be honest, it's just a movie.In the end, I thought Good Boys was hilarious from start to finish. It takes the time to slow down for a few dramatic moments, but they almost feel forced at times, due to the fact that the movie is usually going for comedy 100% of the time until the third act. I think the fact that this movie tries to be like so many other teen comedies actually hurts it in the long run, since they're little kids, but when I was watching it, I really wasn't thinking about that. Good Boys is a really solid comedy that had me laughing throughout, but it's not without its issues. If you're simply looking for a good laugh, definitely check it out.",Good Boys
59,nicholls905-280-546911,Not my thing,6,3 November 2019,"This looked okay on the trailer, but the concept tires after a while. Superbad for a whole new generation, only this time it's young kids.

Funny at times, but not my type of film.",Good Boys
60,brankovranjkovic,Good Boys - Hilarious raunchy comedy about three naive 12 year olds,7,23 August 2019,"Coming of age comedy, raunchy adventure.Three 12 year old kids call themselves 'The Bean Bag Boys', they are invited to their first 'kissing party'. They need tips on their first kiss, google provides some entertaining answers.

Along the way some drugs are accidentally stolen.The plot is really thin, though this doesn't really matter.

61,SoumikBanerjee25,"A Failure in Execution, Resulting a Poor Final Product",2,19 March 2020,"A comedy film, consisting three child actors with some good acting skills. I thought and hoped it would be funny, it might be something memorable. Alas! What an utter crap this was! The Comedic moments failed to make any sort of impact most of the times. The jokes didn't land well either. The nitty gritty nature of those child characters failed to last an impression on us. Although I would solely blame the Writing and Screenplay for that. They gave their best. That's all they could have done with such hollow script! Background score was below average. The Technical sides were just okay, nothing Innovative. They tried to indulge in some moral lessons towards the end and to be honest I personally liked that touch; still it felt half baked Though. Hence the good performances from the main characters gone unnoticed largely because of how weak the execution was. It's hightime makers do need to understand that using F-Words or the inclusion of adult jokes doesn't make a film funnier on itself. It requires perfect execution of such Punchlines with proper adequacy. Comedy genre is one of the hardest to master out there as it requires lots of Hardwork and talent to Make people genuinely laugh. In the end it's a Movie that Some people might find funny, I won't judge them. Everyone has different choices but I honestly didn't! At all.",Good Boys

65,Beejerman,JUST OKAY - (6 stars out of 10),6,26 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...Crude, lude, and rude, ""Good Boys"" pushes the envelope for some cheap laughs - but, I still laughed (in parts). It attempts to take the relative innocence of elementary school age children and mix it with teenage antics and adult humor. Oh yeah, and they have really, really bad ... potty mouth.Three close friends are invited to their first ""kissing party"" and more than ever, Max (Jacob Tremblay) wants to go because he knows that the love of his young life, Brixlee, is going to be there. The only problem is, he has no idea how to kiss. So, they rig up his father's drone to spy on the neighbor girl when her boyfriend comes over. She spots the drone, captures it, and the 3 boys' adventure starts when they decide to skip school and get it back before his Dad comes home and notices it's missing - and then make it to the party so he can kiss who he believes will be his future wife.Soooooo ... even though this movie had some laugh out loud moments, I just wasn't feeling it. I get the reason behind it, and how that some of the gags wouldn't work unless it was played out by pre-teen boys. I remember when ""The Bad News Bears"" came out and how my parents wouldn't let my brother and I watch it because it took things to a level they didn't want us to see. THIS movie takes that and multiplies it by 100. Yeah, this is not a movie for kids. This is an adult movie.I can't recommend it. It was ""okay"", but I feel other movies with boys this same age, like ""The Sandlot"", to be much more funny and heartwarming. Those movies last, they stick with you.

67,ronakkotian,A cheap version of Superbad,5,18 August 2019,"Remember the movie Superbad? Remember how funny and original the jokes were and how memorable and relatable the main characters were. Well, Good Boys tries to get to the same level but in the end, it doesn't.Good Boys follows three ""tweens"" who get invited to a kissing party but meet trouble along the way whilst trying to learn how to kiss.Good Boys isn't bad but it gets tiresome as the movie progresses. Hearing six graders swear constantly is funny at first but the film overused that joke to the point where it became boring and irritating. The sex jokes involving kids is also hilarious to watch due to their naivety towards it but, again, the jokes get recycled to the point where it doesn't feel funny anymore. This is the film's biggest flaw. The jokes which the makers solely relied on throughout the whole movie get so repetitive that the film's purpose gets ruined.The three kids did a great job and have good chemistry but there wasn't really anything memorable about them. What made Superbad so special, aside from the humour, was how memorable each character was. There were some great intimate moments between Seth and Evan which strengthened their characters. Good Boys doesn't give the same feelings since you're not as close with these kids. If they improved the script and direction by writing more clever humour and fleshing out the characters then Good Boys would've had a chance to be as good as Superbad.",Good Boys

Underneath this seemingly standard raunchy comedy that only appeals to the younger, less mature demographic is a heartfelt story of friendship, adolescence, and being there for the people that you care about.
The three stars do a fantastic job with the material they've been given. They deliver their lines in a humorous and entertaining way.

75,sweidman-28016,"Funny Comedy, Not the Best Plot",6,30 August 2019,"Good Boys Review:Good Boys is from producers Seth Rogan and Jonah Hill and follows three 6th grade boys that ditch school and embark on an epic journey while carrying accidentally stolen drugs, being hunted by teenage girls, and trying to make their way home in time for a long-awaited party. I'm not the biggest on comedies, though I thought from the trailer and with those two producers it had a chance at being an actual fine movie. Some people were getting Superbad vibes so I actually watched it a few weeks ago for the first time and I thought it was pretty funny and not bad at all. That movie gave me some hope. Good Boys excels in comedy. By all means this is a pretty funny movie. Just like many comedies the plot fails to keep a compelling story, however. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen basically the whole movie. Most of everything that was in the trailers was in the first 20 minutes. Not saying that's bad though. I really liked the comedic scenes. That's all thanks to the three leads: Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams, and Brady Noon. For being so young they do pretty well. They went out of their comfort zone, at least mostly I think, to make this very crude movie. The performances aren't anything great but enjoyable. From how they were marketing I thought it would be much more in appropriate, which it still is, but honestly it was just mostly rated R for profanity. It may have just been me but they swore excessively for being in 6th grade. And I don't know if I was just smart but they were pretty dumb with some stuff that most people knew when I was their age. Those past couple sentences make me feel old. It made situations funny though. Once again, the plot is not that great. Basically everything was predictable, again thanks to the trailer. I didn't expect anything more though. The first two acts were strong but the last act felt very weak to me. The last 10 minutes I weren't interesting and I kind of wanted it to end or at least choose a little something different to do. Not trying to make this movie sound bad. It's enjoyable but I don't think it's a much watch. It's exactly what you think it is. A little overrated from some critics in my opinion but some people really like comedies. Good Boys is a fine comedy. For it to be better I just wanted a little more of a plot. I'd recommend this if you want a good laugh and a fun time.My Grade: B-",Good Boys

And though We were certainly more hardcore in a manner of speaking in my day, and had real adventures, at least this film was like a stepping stone for young guys coming up in todays crazy world. Hopefully, and I know it sounds weird since it is rated R ( but whatever, whom didnt grow up watching a few rated r flicks? lol) I really hope a lot of people and their sons watch this film.

Plenty goes wrong and they end up on a low-stakes adventure, trying to replace a drone, even though they end up in a cat-and-mouse game with Hannah (Gordon) and Lily (Francis), two college-aged women who they've accidentally stolen drugs from.There's lots of winks and 'adults-only' jokes as the three boys mess up terminology or misinterpret things.

Good boys was really good it got off to a very shaky start but got better and better as the film progressed lets talk about why this is.First of all the film was absolutely hilarious,and kept the same funny tone throughout. The film had a surprising amount of funny scenes that really made me laugh at the characters. And the best part was this kind of tone stayed consistent throughout the whole film as well as developing on more sweet heartfelt coming of age kind of tones and issues. This was mostly helped by using the kids innocence as the main source of humour. Due to the kids being so young and innocent they did not have a clue what kind of things they were watching and doing throughout the whole film which was just brilliant. Whether it was alcohol porn,adult sex toys you name it they had it but the fact they were so clueless as to what they were just made the humour more organic and consistent throughout the whole film. And one more thing about the humour i thought the cameo from Stephan merchant was one of the funniest scenes in the film. They played on stereotypes with his character really well and his interaction with the kids and the ""CPR"" doll was hilarious.Next the film had a good amount of relatable themes during the last half of the film. I think that the film touched well on relatable issues during the second half of the film. The fact that a child feels responsible for there parents split is a big issue within a lot of divorces and the film touched on it very well. And also the film did very well by explaining that friends want different things in life and drift apart as this happens to most people with high school friends.However i do have to say that the film had a very generic high school formula. I just wish that if there is a high school kind of setting to the plot there need to be some form of depth and importance instead of just the generic cool kids/bullies.Next i loved the use of props throughout the film, this was another thing that bought a lot of humour for me. The fact that they used dildos to barricade a door and them swinging on a sex swing just once again proved there innocence and the humour that brings along with it.Now for my final two negatives. The first half of the film was fairly poor. First the pacing for me was extremely rushed. They went through each scene far to quickly so any signs of a diverse tone was mention but not developed enough for it to be introduced as it just made the film feel more generic and simple. And next i thought the script was incredibly cringey. The bullies were saying horrible lines that made me cringe and the fact that they were all 11/12 made it more cringey. As it did not sound right coming from such young children but then once you got used to it in the second half it was not an issue.But now time for my final two positives. First of all the acting was solid in the film. But my key standouts would be Jacob Tremblay and keith L williams. Jacob tremblay was contagious in this film. He just brings such a good energy to his role and he is a very likeable person and his character was very entertaining to watch. And Keith was amazing here. He had the best comedic timing and was the most likeable character in the whole film. I hope Both of these two get more work.overall despite having a weak first half. Good boys more then makes up for it in the second half. And delivers a very funny,entertaining and sweet comedy that brings a new wave to comedy.",Good Boys
89,gustheaffen,"Started pretty slow, 2nd half pretty funny/heartfelt",6,8 July 2020,"Coming of age, the first part of the movie was so-so. Most of what was supposed to be funny sort of missed the mark. It because a lot funnier after they had to go on their mission and of course it was a nice story overall about being together, growing apart and still being able to come together.",Good Boys
90,themadmovieman,"Really funny, made even better by heartwarming and refreshing coming-of-age storytelling",7,12 August 2019,"With a premise that works as a blend between Superbad and Sausage Party, Good Boys has all the potential to be a properly funny watch, but even more potential to be a grating and irritating mess. Fortunately, it avoids the latter throughout, impressing with genuinely funny comedy, three great central performances, and a story that - while pretty much another rehash of Superbad - has got a little bit of heartwarming depth to it, making Good Boys a genuinely enjoyable and often really sweet watch.First things first, though, the main reason you'll be watching this film is for a bunch of swearing twelve year-olds. Now, it's a fun premise that does feel a bit risqué at first, but much like Sausage Party, it's an idea that relies heavily on shock value - something that can wear thin very fast.The reason that Good Boys works where Sausage Party doesn't, however, is that it gives a little bit of context and reason to that shock value. Vulgar fruit and vegetables are a funny idea for about five minutes, whereas the fun of Good Boys actually comes from laughing at the characters' innocence about the adult world - even if they pretend to act like big grown-up teenagers.And that's what I loved most about this movie. It would be so easy to make an R-rated movie like this star sixth-graders that just act like teenagers, but Good Boys never forgets that its main characters are still young kids, and even when they're swearing and getting up to all sorts of adolescent mischief, they're still sixth-graders at heart: naive about the world around them, and wonderfully genuine and sweet to the core.So, while Good Boys has some really great laughs throughout - and the shock value of a trio of twelve year-olds caught up in an R-rated world endures really well - one of its other strongest points is its surprisingly genuine and heartwarming emotional centre, telling a coming-of-age tale that we don't often get to see on the big screen.Of course, the core focus of the film is comedy, and it does a good job at that right the way through. However, Good Boys also has a story worth paying attention to, as it focuses on the world of young kids trying to grow up and fit into the adolescent world - shaking off their innocence as they begin to navigate the complexities of society for the first time.Most coming-of-age movies focus on late teenagers moving towards the adult world, so it was really refreshing to see a film tackle the struggles of even younger kids as they grow up, all the while telling a genuinely heartwarming story about staying true to yourself, even when you and your best of friends begin to grow apart.From that, it's clear that Good Boys is actually a lot more than the vulgar comedy it seems to set up as being, with real heart and likability that's furthered not only by good humour but also three dynamite central performances from Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams and Brady Noon, all of whom pull off the difficult balance of acting just enough like a kid while still fitting into an R-rated movie without a problem.Overall, I had a great time with Good Boys. A great comedy with good laughs and likable characters, as well as a refreshing story with a lot more depth than you might expect at first, it's a surprising but most importantly thoroughly entertaining watch right the way through.",Good Boys

92,WalkdenEntertainment,3 Boys sharing a day they will never forget...,7,24 September 2019,"Three boys who are currently in 6th grade skip school and deal with a number of surprising situations together. All events start after one of the boys receives an invite to a party which will include a ""Kissing Game"" and naturally our lead characters become both curious somewhat freaked out by the fact they have never kissed a girl before. What starts off as boys investigating how to kiss girls naturally goes to drugs, broken bones, drinking, stealing and so much more.A surprising element to Good Boys is that some of the producers behind this film include Seth Rogan & Jonah Hill who both worked/starred in the film ""Superbad"", featured in 2007. I'm guilty to admit that while watching this film I found a number of similar elements to Superbad. Instead of 3 High School Students we have 3 Primary Kids as leads causing mischief.Where the jokes differ in Good Boy is more on the concept that young 6th graders show more innocence as they make 1st time discoveries. Not being able to say a sexual word correctly or knowing when they have a sexual object in their hands are just some examples of the jokes here. The minor problem I have with this type of humour is that the formula is repeated over and over again for key laughs through the whole film. It's also unfortunate that film movie trailer show the best laughs and by time I viewed this film, there wasn't much in regards to the ""best jokes"" left for in cinema. That being said, I can't deny there's still some enjoyment here. Perhaps it's the journey of friendships, growing up and the general feel vibes that make this film more enjoyable than just all the crude and crass jokes.I must also give credit to the young actors who have given a fun performance on screen. I can only assume the performances would have been slightly awkward to deliver at times.Overall, Good Boys does generally deliver good vibes of young friendships and the challenges of being in high school. While the film does have jokes, the method of how our laughs come can feel repetitive. The film's promotional trailer also revealed far too much which made me feel slightly robbed of the main feature in cinema.6.6/10

I like the idea about making a movie about how kids are today where they can be easily exposed to explicit stuff which can influence how they act, but plot is just too cheesy and not that relatable to kids in my opinion. If you search up the best comedy movies of the 2010s, the vast majority of the movies listed are from 2010-2014 and that's exactly how I feel, which is that most of my favourite comedy movies from this decade are from the first half of the decade.

Williams star in this sweet, but exceptionally raunchy comedy designed to make you laugh. Good Boys is the complete opposite to a dull kids' comedy packed with slapstick and potty jokes, in which it features a pleasing story of typical tweens obsessed with grown up material.Basically, Good Boys snatches the story of Superbad and replaces the teens with tweens. Partying and trying to fit in with all the ""cool kids"" is the largest and most realistic topic in the film, and is added to with the style of humour that numerous teens and adults love. You simply cannot expect to be coated in childish humour whilst watching good boys, as the film is undeniably not for kids. As most films and shows contain, there are always unnecessarily prolonged scenes in Good Boys. Although they each feature several hilarious jokes, it makes this comedy almost fully great, but not 100%-the-best.Looking for a dull, childish, and dumb humoured film for a popcorn movie night? Well Good Boys is the direct diverse to those words, but is enjoyable popcorn fun for adults.

97,cinephile-27690,Good Boys Is A Good Movie-one of my top 10 comedies of all time now!,10,18 August 2019,"Good Boys is the Stand By Me of our time! Like the 1986 movie, some close friends-all boys, do bad things when their parents are not around, and learn about growing up during their journey. But unlike Stand By Me, which puts tears in your eyes from sadness, Good Boys puts tears in your eyes from laughing.The so-called Good Boys are Max, Lucas, and Thor, played by Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams, and Brady Noon respectively. These boys are excited to have a day to themselves while Max's Dad is away, but after they get into a pickle, they decide to ditch school to fix it, which gets them stuck with a sex drug, sex toys, and alcohol.If raunchy humor is not for you, then Good Boys isn't either. The F word is said numerous times,and sex toys and drugs play a large role...so just because there are kids in the movie, don't think you can take yours to see it!However, through all of the raunchy elements, Good Boys finds a way to move the audience as well. Like in Stand By Me, the boys learn about growing up, and the boys deal with bullying, crushes, bravery, and other obstacles kids realistically go through. One kid goes through his parent's divorce as well.The 3 boys are obviously the hit of the show, and they do a good job at their roles. Nothing Oscar worthy of course, but I see potential for all of them in the future. Jacob Tremblay already showed it in Wonder, and he proves it again in this movie!The audience and myself laughed on many occasions, if sexual humor is YOUR kind of humor,(I can't stress that enough!), this is a very funny comedy! I must have laughed a double digit amount of times, I'm not even sure how much, but it was often!""These are kids who drop F-bombs left and right, but they also giggle as they ride their bikes through the sprinklers. And for a while, {the director} finds a charming balance between who they really are and who they're pretending to be. But pretty soon, it becomes clear that this is a one-joke movie-Oh my {Lord}, these cute 12-year-olds are swearing!-and once that one joke has run its course, it feels like a struggle just to reach the 90-minute mark.""I see what she means, but I never tired of the ""one joke"", and the swearing isn't the only punchline. But even Christy mentions that the movie has heart as well!I am not giving this a 10 because it's a masterpiece. As I write this, Good Boys is my 7th favorite comedy, behind movies like Blazing Saddles and There's Something About Mary. My 7th favorite movie of all time as of now is a tie with Love Actually and Valentine's Day, behind movies like The Last Temptation of Christ and My Fair Lady.These films obviously do not compare. That's why I separate comedies. As a film that is just meant for fun and laughs, Good Boys immensely succeeds.Since this released yesterday, I can assume it'll be on DVD by Christmas. I'm adding this to my Christmas wish list in that case! Good Boys is in fact good as a movie, but as a comedy, it may be one of the genre's greats!PS, This also marks the first time I went to a movie theater by myself, so this was coming of age for myself as well!I would also look forward to a Good Girls or a sequel with these boys!",Good Boys

99,patriciogl10,Embrace the fun.,6,27 December 2019,"There should be more films starring young kids, it seems to be a rather efficient and appealing formula, but of course to make it work you need a good script, a good mixture of actors and overall an engaging story. Good Boys has all that, but what probably stands out the most is the chemistry between the Beanbag Boys (Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams and Brady Noon), all of whom have great, realistic performances.
Sure this movie revisits some of the tiring clichés about high school, popular kids, parties and ""getting the girl"", but they don't become the center of it, just a small part, the destination, which becomes especially less interest when the ride has been as fun as it was throughout the most part of the film. So the cliché moments quickly fade away, even though I might add it has a different vibe because the film deals with pre-teen kids when the majority of movies when these clichés take place are those of full blown teenagers. So naturally, it had a more innocent vibe to it.Frenetic adventures, broken drones, stolen drugs, kissing parties, fights in frat houses, all comprising humourous situations present in the film, aided of course by the engaging relationship these boys have with each other, the Beanbag Boys, who do everything together and are inseparable, a fraternity that familiar can only be conveyed by great acting and believable rapport.Good Boys it's a nice, fun R rated adventure about growing up.

Good Boys is no exception to this. The story follows three 6th grade boys as they try to make head way in the horrifying new social climate that is middle school. The comedy is mostly situational, with the recurring theme being the kids innocence and negligence while being exposed to adult items and past times. I was most impressed with the writers' ability to capture that sense of awkwardness and self-doubt most people face at that age. Good Boys will almost certainly give you a few hard laughs.",Good Boys
102,CabbageCustard,"There's a lot to enjoy here, but.....",7,1 November 2019,"I find myself quite equivocal when it comes to reviewing this movie. On the one hand, there are some genuinely funny and clever moments here, however I can't get over the fact that this was written by grown men who think that things like prepubescent boys swearing, a young boy crying over his parents' divorce, a father congratulating his tween son on learning to masturbate, and teenagers getting high on illicit drugs are great comedy fodder. As I watched this, I just knew that somehow or other Seth Rogan had to be involved. Sure enough, as the credits rolled, there was his name. Fortunately, other people were involved in this as well, and some of them obviously have genuine comedic instincts because some of the gags really are clever, insightful and funny. The movie also benefits from a bunch of genuinely talented young actors, particularly the three young men who play the titular good boys. Despite the heavy and mostly unnecessary profanity, they are extremely likeable, handle the comedy well and carry the movie. Surprisingly also, there are some real bittersweet, poignant moments in this and it is quite effective in what it has to say about growing up and growing apart from the friends we had as kids. That's a message that will resonate with many viewers.I'm embarrassed to admit that I laughed quite a bit during this movie, but I cringed quite a bit too. That being said, I really don't know if this is a movie I can recommend. I enjoyed it - most of it - but I can't help feeling that I shouldn't have.Finally, if the restricted rating and what I have said already hasn't alerted you, please be aware that this is definitely NOT a family movie.",Good Boys

106,kingofdanerds,In the spirit of Superbad and comedies like Superbad,8,16 September 2020,"Ah yes, the 2019 coming of age comedy known as Good Boys. I remember seeing the trailer for this film and I knew that I had to go see it. Of course, I did not go and see it in theaters but it has not stopped me from viewing this film entirely. Good Boys was produced by Seth Rogen (who worked on comedies like Superbad and Sausage Party). The film stars Jacob Tremblay (who previously played in Wonder), Keith L. Williams, and Brady Noon. All of whom are about 13 years old! Good Boys was a critical success with critics and audiences alike. The film was a success at the box office, making over $111 million.The story here follows three boys who call themselves the ""Bean Bag Boys"". The characters are Max (Jacob Tremblay), Lucas (Keith L. Williams), and Thor (Brady Noon). They are in middle school and Max is invited to a ""kissing party"". Max is nervous because he does not know how to kiss. So, he enlists in the help of his friends Lucas and Thor. One thing leads to another as we see our characters make their way to this kissing party. Obstacles include drugged up teenagers, drones, and much more!!!The plot is very similar to Superbad in a way and viewers who have watched Superbad may notice how similar this film is to Superbad. But it is not just Superbad that you can compare Good Boys to. This type of film has been done before. But never really done with middle school kids. The character types are very typical here with Thor being the ""rebel"". Lucas would be the ""good kid"" and Max would be somewhat in between the two. The film here is quite hilarious and manages to get plenty of laughs. The comedy relies on the raunchiness of this film. In all, shock humor. But yet again, some of this stuff was seen in other comedies of the same style. Character interaction is also something that works well here and it too gets some good laughs. The acting is done fairly well here and the younger cast is pretty good. Since this is a coming of age comedy, does this film depict a good coming of age story. Yes it does. I myself may have never been invited to a kissing party, or crossed a busy highway, or even done anything really in this film., but I would definitely have acted that way if I was in 6th grade. Without a doubt! It does depict the want to have a girlfriend/first kiss fairly well in this film and is fairly relateable.Good Boys can easily be compared to other films of the same type (like Superbad) but Good Boys can and does stand well on its own. It is hilarious, raunchy, and is an entertaining film from start to finish. It is one of those films that are the ""it's what I expected"". If you like Superbad, you most likely would enjoy this film!",Good Boys
107,JaydoDre,"One of the funniest movies I've seen, but clearly not for everyone",9,4 November 2019,"I think that vulgar shock humour is divisive at its core and that is the problem we have here. I recall Sausage Party, a filthy comedy from a few years back, had some people laughing on the floor and (most) others utterly hating it. I came to IMDB expecting Good Boys to have a perfect score, and then remembered, ""Oh right, this is an immature comedy and it's 2019"".However, unlike Sausage Party, which seemed to have the sole objective of shocking you with gross-out humour, Good Boys is considerably smarter, despite also having a lot of dumb humour. There is a quick line uttered by the kids in this movie: ""I am not a feminist. I like women"". It's brushed over very quickly and the movie moves on, but it's full of brilliant well-timed little nuggets like this one.The movie does have a plot of sorts, but not a central plot. It goes from one situation to the other to the other, as the position in which the main characters find themselves gets progressively worse.Although one can have objections to the type of comedy this is, I don't think you can say that the technical side of things is bad. The acting is just fine (remember, these are 3 kids. 1 kid in a movie is usually annoying enough) and the camera work is too, and, in fact, the latter is used rather creatively a few times.If you like content like the early Family Guy or Tosh.0 or South Park, then Good Boys should be up your alley. If you cringed at those, you will cringe at this movie too.",Good Boys

110,RhapsodyReviews,Very Funny with a Good Story.,8,24 November 2019,"Review:
'Good Boys' is a coming-of-age-comedy film directed by Gene Stupnitsky.
This movie is being compared to 'Superbad' (2007). I don't think it's a fair comparison. Sure, we have three friends getting into trouble while trying to get to a party. However, this is a coming-of-age story with a lot of laughs more than a dumb comedy about sex and drugs which 'Superbad' was at its core.
The film stars Jacob Tremblay, Keith Williams, and Brady Noon as three sixth graders who find themselves involved in a series of misadventures as they try to attend a party hosted by their popular classmates.
The three leads in the movie do a great job at portraying a realistic, maybe possibly more eccentric version of what 12-year-old would act like. When parents aren't around kids, more than likely they talk about sex and curse like truckers. There is also an innocents to them when it comes to drugs and alcohol.
I was worried that a lot of ther laughs were only going to be shown in the trailer to get people to the theatre. This movie made me laughs from beginning to end, but it was empty laughs. The movie is funny, but the story is important as well. People grow up and not everything can stay the same.
Overall, I went into this movie thinking it was going to make me laugh, but I didn't know it was going to have the story it has. I enjoyed every minute of it and recommend it to all adults and mature teens.

The mouths on these kids are a bit beyond their years I think. It was pretty funny, but the scene in the convenience store with the cop was a literal laugh out loud moment.What actually resonated with me most was the truth behind childhood friends.

In fact, Good Boys is one of the better comedies 2019 has to offer.We first meet Max (Jacob Tremblay), when he gets disturbed by his father while playing around with the design of a well formed World of Warcraft-like avatar. Clearly in early stages of puberty, Max seems a bit ahead of his two best friends Thor (Brady Noon) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams). While Max daydreams about a girl he has a crush on, Thor just wants to be the angelic singer he's meant to be, but feels conflicted when trying to fit in with the popular kids in his grade. Lucas on the other hand, is dealing with some personal issues at home, which he doesn't feel comfortable discussing with his friends just yet. When Max gets invited to a party, after impressing some of the tougher kids at school, our group of boys realises there might be some ""first base""-action happening. This calls for preparation - may it be online, in person or even by spying on girls in the neighbourhood. The latter doesn't happen as smoothly as they had hoped for and they'll soon have to deal with a duo of Molly-poppin' teenage girls, who'll chase them around until they get what they've lost.No new ground gets broken in this directorial debut by 'The Office'-writer, Gene Stupnitsky. Many teen-hormonal-comedies popped into my head while watching this - from American Pie to Sex Drive to The Girl Next Door. But where those kind of films always focused on senior students, Good Boys follows a group of tweens who think they know everything there needs to be known about growing up. Using a very impressive vocabulary in the wrong way, brought the biggest smiles to my face. It's all in good fun.Our main trio is pretty damn impressive. Tremblay (Room) keeps showing off his acting skills, with every project he takes on. While this could be Noon and Williams' big breakthrough on the big screen, after mostly working on television. They've surely showcased their comedic skills and still being so young, who knows where we'll see them in about ten years?!Good Boys is harmless fun. There's lots to laugh at for adult viewers, with plenty of sex-jokes and physical humour. Enough adorable moments balance out the huge amount of F-bombs, without ever having to fall back on cheap toilet humour. I do think its main audience will probably be found when this film hits the ancillary market. Teenage boys who are too young to be allowed into these screenings, will definitely be checking this out as soon as it hits streaming services.",Good Boys
119,brandonneicke,AWESOME FUNNY MOVIE,10,5 January 2020,Trip down memory lane. Been a while since I was a young kid like this and these kids are hilarious. It's a funny movie that actually has meaning. Rated R so if your soft and don't like real life stuff then stick to pg 13 comedies. This was a super funny movie,Good Boys
120,chevolek,Awful Movie !!!!,1,17 August 2019,"This is absolutely a no-brains movie that relies on foul language, sex and drugs to try very hard to be funny. I couldn´t give it a 0 unfortunately.
I am not giving this movie a low rating because they use kids on it (swearing every 2 minutes) but that is a new low.
Do not believe the good reviews, avoid this movie at all costs and save money and time.",Good Boys
121,cadillac20,"Unoriginal, crass, and shallow, Good Boys probably looked better on paper than it does on screen.",5,11 July 2019,"Comedy has always evolved by pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in the face of the public. What constitutes as a typical for comedy in film and TV today would have been unheard of 50 years ago except maybe in comedy clubs and private venues. So, perhaps then, it's inevitable that we would arrive at a comedy about sixth graders cussing, drinking from a beer bottle, and talking about sex. And I am sure that there is an intelligent way to write about something like that. Unfortunately, Good Boys is not smartly written. It's funny to a point, but the film seems to be so smitten by the sixth grade boys poking around adult themes that it rarely tries to go beyond being raunchy and crass. Pre-teens saying fuck can be funny to a point, it worked for South Park, but after hearing it a dozen times, it kind of stops being funny. That's how much of the humor is in Good Boys. Mostly funny in concept or in a trailer, where you take the film in snippets, it's a film that doesn't go much deeper than shallow jokes and tired tropes.I will say that maybe this simply wasn't for me. It is amusing in the same way it's amusing to see kids do shocking things that make us laugh. Maybe this film works better for young parents who are young enough to appreciate the raunchy and raucous comedies from the past three or so decades and now have little sixth graders of their own. Maybe the idea of pre-teens acting this way is hilarious to that specific crowd. I honestly have no idea. But the jokes here feel too easy and too shallow. Part of the problem here is that the film wants to convey the feeling of films we've seen before, but with sixth graders instead. When Seth and Evan go to get beer for a high school party in Superbad and end up getting wasted when they get there, it comes across as natural and relatable because, even if that wasn't us in high school, we at least heard about someone in high school like that. When a sixth grader goes to steal a beer and goes to a '""rager"" at his sixth grade friends house, it enters a field of parody. Who knows, maybe this was meant to be a parody of those films. It would certainly make more sense. Here, though, it doesn't feel like a parody. Then again, maybe that's what sixth graders are in fact doing. The film does give the kids slightly more innocent things to focus on, like kissing and not getting grounded, and it would be more funny if the humor was written with more wit, but things essentially boil down to 'What are anal beads?', 'I want to learn how to kiss, so let's look up porn', and 'we're in sixth grade, but the cool kids take a couple sips of beer, so I want to too'.It doesn't help that we're forced to spend time with kids that leave a lot to be desired in the way of acting. These kids certainly seem like they could be good actors, but the jokes they have to tell feel so forced and they're stuck in such cliched parts, it comes across as, once again, parody. Jacob Tremblay, playing lead Max, has a pretty decent resume, but here he's the typical lead, an everyman who wants the girl and goes to great, exaggerated lengths to get there. Brady Noon is drama kid Thor, who wants to be cool, but tries too hard. And Keith L. Williams is the nice, honest guy to a fault. These are all archetypes we saw in American Pie, shrunk down to pint size levels and who's cares and concerns are simpler forms of getting laid, getting drunk, and figuring out how to grow up. The only problem is that this film wants to apply the same standards of those comedies to this one. On paper, it probably seems like a great idea. In execution, we get characters who are conflicted in the worst ways and actors who try to exude both parts of the film, with neither the child like innocence or teen comedy aspects coming across with quality.I found the trailer for the movie to be pretty funny. Perhaps, that is how the film is best enjoyed, in parts. As a whole, it's a better concept than a 90 minute film. There's probably a decent size audience for it too. The audience I saw it with seemed to find it hilarious and critics are giving it good ratings. For myself, I just didn't find it that funny. It didn't feel natural enough to be relatable or witty enough to make me genuinely laugh. Did I laugh? Sure, it was amusing. But as a comedy film, it left a lot to be desired.",Good Boys

It's actually doesn't commit to it's promise of being wildly improper humor and just kind of seems like a middle of the road kids movie with some cursing in it..the only people mildly interesting were the very funny older druggie molly taking teen girls whose only purpose was to get high through this thing.

124,samyoung-82648,Interesting Bildungsroman Film,8,30 October 2019,"The good: This film takes a risk. It shows three boys learning about the world as they transition into their teens. There are some very funny moments. Also, there is very little political correctness in this movie which is as rare has hen's teeth in modern Hollywood.The average: The film relies too much on bad language, drugs and sex to tell the story. It's really unnecessary and doesn't add much to the story other than a few laughs.The bad: This movie could be used to help young boys understand the world around them and that it's ok to challenge your boundaries. Sadly, this movie can't fulfil that role because the film was made as an r rated movie. Also, it spends too much time on smut, vulgarity and illicit substances for no benefit.Despite giving the film an 8/10 I would be far more likely to recommend Stand by Me. Good Boys took a risk and I think it paid off for sheer entertainment. However, it could have been so much more, especially in our age of mandated political correctness. We could really do with a risque movie for young boys that is free of Hollywoodisms. This movie is so close, yet so far.",Good Boys
125,Fudge-3,Comedy that exploits innocent goodness,6,13 August 2019,"Three grade 6 boys (age 11 - 12) go on a quest to a kissing party.Most of the gags rise from the boys' innocence and misunderstanding of some sexual activity. It is funny but you will be laughing at the boys rather than with them. That makes it feel awkward. There is some farce, screwball and slapstick too.The story is contrived and far fetched. It reminded me a lot of another recent teen movie; Booksmart, but here the protagonists are much younger than the target audience so no one will be learning anything.I liked the creepy sister.",Good Boys
126,JankiSharma,genuinely good boys,10,21 August 2019,"Director Gene Stupnitsky has done a fun movie again ( Bad teacher with cameron diaz was great fun)and did a great job.
Jacob Tremblay ( from The Room) as Max) , Keith Williams as Lucas and Brady Noon as Thor are 3 good boys who show true enthusiasm when see ing new stuff and are fun when they see sex toys in their parents' bedroom. Their conversations are typical 11 yr old talk and their fascination with girls is hilarious. Molly Gordon as Hannah whose close friend Lily (Midori Francis) are excellent as 2 girls in their 20s who love parties, sex and drugs. My favorite part of movie is when 3 boys try to cross a very busy highway. Keith Williams as Lucas is genuinely funny and has great lines. Enjoyed the movie a lot. reminded me of my happiness when i saw American pie movies about 4 best bad boys... It is fun being good boys. 89 minutes of fun , silliness and enjoyable script.",Good Boys

134,DeadMansTrousers,Over advertising ruined this,4,31 October 2019,I go to the movies a lot because I am an AMC Stubs member and they showed multiple different trailers for this film in front of every movie for months. By the time I actually saw the movie the majority of the funniest jokes had been ruined because of this.Apart from the over advertising the film itself is filled with current culture references that seem like they are aimed at tweens which makes zero sense considering they aren't the core audience for this film.Overall this film is very forgettable and the advertising ruined the best jokes so it ended up not being very funny.,Good Boys

When the boys, well-meaning but unrestrained, mess up and then try to make things right, they end up only making everything worse. I was expecting this movie to be run of the mill, so i was pleasantly surprised. The characters are believable and even identifiable, the screenplay is well-developed and sharply written. The amazing Jacob Tremblay, who plays his part to perfection, leads a winning cast. Perhaps only Izaac Wang lacks the heft to play the part of popular student Soren, but Midori Francis as his sister Lily is truly hilarious. The heartfelt ending helped to wipe away any earlier reservations i might have had about embracing a movie with so many over-the-top moments. Overall, this was still better than expected.",Good Boys

143,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"Good Boys, Gone Bad",6,7 January 2020,"The Stream: A predictable, raunchy comedy aimed at tweens.The Big Screen: Nevertheless, some big, unexpected laughs and nice chemistry between the main leadsThe Final Bill: The tweens the movie is about may get a kick out of it. Everyone else can skip the theater for this one.-Trip FontaineIf teen comedies are to be believed, there comes a time in every young man's life where he and a group of his dutiful pals must run amok for a day or night, getting up to all kinds of shenanigans for the sake of maybe a little attention from his dream girl. McLovin and his friends did it. The American-Pie-guys had a bet that consumed prom night. Ferris took a famous day off. I guess this trope has trickled down to the tween-set. Good Boys has the 12-year-old, newly-minted 6th graders doing it. They are desperate to be cool, while both trying to find their place in middle school and hold on to who they've always been. It's a pretty standard, raunchy R-rated are romp with big laughs but ultimately a predictable plot.The Beanbag Boys are the titular Good Boys, played by Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams and Brady Noon. They are a group a friends, who were pretty nerdy but always supportive of each other; and, now, the transition to middle school leads to questions of whether these BFF are really forever. The main plot though has the boys running from the villainous older neighbor girl and her friend trying to get their drugs, replacing a broken drone, and all with the goal of going to a kissing party at the coolest 6th grader's home. Some very funny stuff happens throughout. Why is it so funny when people get hurt? Dislocated arms, paintballs to the nether regions, etc. There's also a running joke involving sex toys. You have to see to believe.The lead young actors are good. They hit all the notes that are supposed to be there. Tremblay, who was such a revelation in Room, shows that he has some comedic chops. Williams perfectly plays the most rule-abiding kid dealing with some family troubles. When the inevitable moral of the story comes around, the emotional climax feels earned. The problem is that the movie is rated R in order to keep in the strong language and sex toy jokes, but the moral is more suited for a younger audience. As an adult, although I laughed a lot, I wondered why am I watching these 12-year-olds try to go to a kissing party. It's like watching a 2-year-old discover the F-word. Sure, that's funny for a bit, but it's also completely inappropriate and a bad reflection on the parent.Side note: Will Forte shows up as Jacob Tremblay's dad. He, of course, is hilarious in his few minutes of screen time.Ultimately, while Good Boys is funny, you've probably seen it before; and therefore, it's not necessary to watch it in the theater. If you are 12 years old and you can get your older sibling to buy you a ticket, you'll laugh your head off. For the rest of you, kick back one night when it's streaming, get your beanbag, your boys or girls, a bowl of popcorn and chuckle at these shenanigans.",Good Boys

As a parent I don't want my kids to talk like criminals... but the reality is different. Kids do curse sometimes ... just dig into your childhood and you'll realise it was and in some cases still is a part of your (in)direct vocabulary.The movie is not just about (really!) likeable kids using SOME curse words... or their funny distortions.
It's a simple and heartwarming adventure of 3 friends growing up presented in a funny way.What I really liked about those 3 early teenagers was their realistic depiction.
Some kids are obsessed with the opposite sex and having innocent love relationships, like Max.
Others, like Thor, don't care about girls (yet) - they'd like to achieve their dream.
And finally there are some (like) Lucas who love everybody and have a big sense of morality.In conclusion...

It gets old really fast and really shows how thin and forgettable the movie is. HEY ISNT IT FUNNY WHEN KIDS SWEAR EH EH EH???The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because the kids in it are genuinely good with the material they have. Honestly the performances of the 3 leads heighten the poor material they've been given. Tremblay is already an established great child actor and he does a really good job with the comedy beats. The other two are a bit less known, but they really get some of the few laughs this movie has. Whether it's the perfectly timed pre-pubescent scream, or their little jabs at each other, the kids in this truly shine.I'd love to see them in a comedy that is genuinely funny and has good writing, and not one that solely relies on sex jokes for 90 mins.

167,babybuletgani,It's a simple enough conceit that yields rib-tickling rewards in a comedy in,6,30 November 2019,"It's a simple enough conceit that yields rib-tickling rewards in a comedy in which Jonah Hill and Michael Cera's eagerness to get laid is supplanted by an altogether more innocent desire to get to first base. This being a Seth Rogen production, though, getting there is anything but innocent. Indeed, it's a journey steeped in so much filth, profanity and raunch that none of its three leads are permitted to watch the picture legally - a double standard that Universal has been making great hay of in its pre-release advertising. Yet there is a guilelessness at work in Good Boys that offsets all its sex toys, dirty talk and recreational drug use. Tween buddies Max (Jacob Tremblay), Thor (Brady Noon) and Lucas (Keith L. Williams) - 12-year-old school chums who endearingly call themselves ""The Bean Bag Boys"" - may be obsessed with boobs, masturbation and, in Max's case, locking lips with the cutest girl in class. But they are just as consumed by D&D gaming, drama club and being accepted by the cool kids - even if it means being dared to take a swig from a beer bottle and earning the damning sobriquet ""Sippy Cup"" if one gags or refuses.
Our heroes, in short, are nerdy naïfs who are prone to tears, respectful of rules and generally rather clueless So when an urgent need to replace one dad's downed drone has them stealing MDMA from the babes next door, dicing with frat boys or risking their necks crossing a six-lane highway, the results are inevitably chaotic - a cavalcade of wacky incident that ought to generate hilarity by the bucketload. Sadly though, Good Boys really only has one joke: the inappropriate juxtaposition of children with the kinds of things (bad language, giant dildos, anal beads) they're meant to be kept away from. There's plenty of raucous, knockabout fun to be had seeing Tremblay wield a paint gun, Williams dislocate an arm and Noon stuff a beer down his pants. But it all comes down to the same, recycled, R-rated punchline: one that becomes not only less funny but also more predictable the further the film goes on. That's not the fault of its central trio, who have a natural rapport and a fresh-faced charm that are impossible to resist. It's more a failing of a production whose adolescent sense of humour smacks of arrested development and which doesn't really earn the right to take a half-hearted pitch at pathos in its lachrymose closing stages. When it's good, though - during a fast-paced chase scene, for example, in which one of the girls they've stolen drugs from goes all Terminator on the little guys' asses - Good Boys is very good indeed. And there are some nice turns from the grown-ups in the cast as well. Get Out's Lil Rel Howery and comedian Retta make an impression as Lucas' parents, and there's the spectacular sight of Stephen Merchant going full weirdo as a geek with a goatee.",Good Boys
168,tomtalbotty,So hilarious really takes you back to being that age in some ways that also brings a light to the Gen Z way of life.,10,1 September 2019,"This movie is great love these sorts of comedies really hilarious jokes makes kids not as uptight about certain subjects such as identity, sex, drugs, relationships, navigating their bodies and finding out what they like. Jacob Tremblay has done an amazing job as portraying Max so shockingly hilarious when he just comes out and says a swear word, just because if you have followed his acting career you have never seen him say that as he is such a sweet boy so is his characters and him as an overall person. Also really takes you back to those days of being a kid almost teenager as they call themselves tweens discovering what you like and do not like in some many ways. The beer sipping scene is just so hilarious as it takes me back to my first beer where it is disgusting, nevertheless you just take it to be cool and have a can of pop afterwards to get rid of the horrible taste. The girls with the drug Molly was just hilarious as the boys just said who is Molly as they went onto think the girls were drug addicts and it is some sex drug, which that was just so hilarious the innocents in that, However all they wanted to do is just use the drone to film the nymphomaniac neighbour to see what kissing was like. After the realisation hits after the girls just said google it that is what everyone does, which previously the boys typed porn in and that was just so damn suggestive so hilarious, they never even thought to type how to kiss. The sex doll is just hilarious as they thought it was a CPR dummy until Max kissed and found some disgusting pubic hair on the mouth is just hilarious, they still did not realise. The bean bag boys kind of started to realise when a guy came into the house to buy a rare collectible card off them and he offers a lot of money for the doll and the smugness too when he said he would have gone up to one thousand dollars, then the understanding just hit the boys heads was just hysterical when they found out it was a sex doll not a CPR Dummy. The romances were just funny and super cute knowing there not going to last, but just showing the way of life how they know how things work and how to build a strong relationship takes time not just kissing, hugging and holding hands makes a relationship it is the time spent with the person that does. I liked the fact that the bean bag boys talk about not being misogynistic asking the person before kissing them is so great as it teaches consent at the end of the day, which is such an important message to come across to kids and everyone you can do it, but you must ask the persons permission first whether it is sexual or just human contact like kissing or holding hands etc. At the party that was their main goal to get to as Max wanted to meet a girl that he has a crush on for years and kiss her, which led onto the spin the bottle scene not always going to plan for Max is just hysterical. I love that it is showing a controversial subject like being gay, lesbian or bisexual etc, just to be accepting no matter who you are. The other seriousness added onto the gender neutral bathroom in the play just hinted as a cardboard box with a gender neutral sign on just adds meaning showing that is how it should be no matter gender or who you are everyone is equal should have the same toilet facilities, changing rooms etc. Not being ridiculed or pressured into a binary gender society as a person is a person at the end of the day, we should not just separate society as it is a touchy subject when it comes to being different whether it is biologically or personality just be accepting as we are just people at the end of the day. Showing that is the Gen Z way of life talking is so much more comfortable with acceptance as the key word here, it is not about just being girl stuff or boy stuff that should not be shared with either genders and never talked about between yourselves, therefore in Gen Z way of thinking everyone should learn of all aspects of biology and life no matter what they have got or what they are into as Gen Z way off life is just more relaxed and is so awesome due it to be accepting. Overall, I highly recommend you watching it will make you laugh, cry and cringe a bit while taking you back to being a twelve year old even though this is super exaggerated like most comedy movies are, therefore as I am a feminist bringing a light to controversial Gen Z subjects just makes me love this movie even more as education is key when it comes to Gen Z.",Good Boys
169,SoverniX,'Everyone sees what they want to see',10,21 October 2020,"Comedy? Yes, absolutely. But for whom? Not every adult will sit in front of the screen with such a spectacle. I even imagined how my teacher after the first minutes of the tape runs out of the cinema hall shouting 'How can you show this?!'. Question by the way reasonable. If you add 'to it...children?'. Actually, the film is about them, and the plot, let's not be disingenuous, definitely for them. Arguing about morals and morals is stupid, isn't it? You can only accept this or that phenomenon, or not notice it at all - it's like rose-colored glasses. The first, I think, is more reasonable. Watch 'Good boys' is worth at least because it is, perhaps, one of the best embodiments of the last years of the beloved genre of American Comedy, and (!) not so snotty and far from predictable. A state of mild shock will tingle the viewer unexpectedly, as if on a roller coaster - the authors clearly tried to do this.The main character of the picture (I dare not call him a beginner), Jacob Tremblay, a canadian by birth, who has already played at least a dozen completely diverse roles ('Smurfs 2', 'Somnia', 'Predator'), brilliantly tried on the image of a young urban knight-romantic, a fighter against evil and a connoisseur of sincere friendship. It is quite possible that in 'Good boys' the audience will see him as the best of all young actors (performers of adult roles were here more for 'furniture'and frequent taunts at them).And of course you can't ignore the musical component! The popular composition, already familiar all over the planet, very subtly fit into the plot and with a sparkling explosion emphasized the finale of the picture. At some point, I even thought-but the story can continue and shoot the second part...Well, everyone will perceive this film in their own way - Oh, these principles that prevent you from giving a true assessment of your feelings.A generation of a different view of uncut movies. It is not surprising that the big screen to date, the picture path is ordered. However, if you evaluate without prejudice, it turned out to be an incredibly cool, exciting film not only with humor. A very true reflection of reality, even if not always desirable (the notorious alcohol and drugs, meanness and indifference seem closer here than the concepts of friendship, loyalty and love), but still - the main characters see this failed world in their own way and only they decide what comes first for them!

From a filmmaker perspective, the cinematography is great, story is tight and characters are well done.
This would have been an iconic film to the degree of the Max Keebler series, had it not been written with wall to wall F-Words, perverted imagery, adult themes, and party drugs.
Why would anyone write an R-Rated Adult themed kids movie is unfathomable.
This movie has eight year olds looking up porn, swinging in sex harnesses, dildos, real sex doll, sex drugs, kids making out in a basement, stealing, buying drugs, black mailing two gay teen girls, all wrapped and twisted around a kids story about friendship, perhaps in order to make it semi-tolerable. It's like giving soda to a diabetic. Its just a bad idea.

I was this age once, and people saying that's what kids are like, well, it's not true. We always felt sorry for the kids who were anywhere near like this because they were the kids living below the poverty line, experiencing one or two violet parents, or the children of hardcore drug addicts, or the children of neglect. They were the kids living on the fringes of my happy childhood and they were never well-liked and they never thrived. Why would filmmakers want to glorify the awful, damaged children of damaging parents? I think this movie is really rather horrible, even if I did get a chuckle from it here or there.

182,Cantoris-2,Cute but decadent,4,17 August 2019,"When a friend pointed out a preview on Youtube, my response was ""cute but decadent."" After seeing more clips and outtakes, the movie began to look promising, and I entered the cinema with high hopes, really wanting to like it.Every boy nowadays should be well warned, before his first day of school one fears, that these are not the best of times to be one. He will have a long uphill fight and sooner or later be blamed and punished (not to mention drugged) for perfectly normal behavior. Feminism, whose claimed goal of ""equality"" rings hollower every year, has stacked the deck heavily against him. To name just one way: thanks to various educational practices, he now has at least 1/3 less chance than his female classmates of getting into college. Lotsa luck finding a feminist who will admit that this situation is in any way unjust, problematic, or unpropitious for society's future. Furthermore, he is best advised to postpone indefinitely a relationship with the opposite sex. This is the advice not of prudery but prudence, just as prudence avoids Russian roulette. Read the not-so-fine print about the probability of divorce, who usually initiates it, and the usual fate of a husband in family court-- assuming that a relationship even gets as far as marriage before a guy is me-tooed. In summary: Masculinity itself is toxic, haven't you heard?So a film whose title asserts that there is even such a thing as a good boy and undertakes a sympathetic look at his life should make a welcome contribution to the culture. But lamentably, in this case it stops there. With a heavy sigh, I must return to my verdict at first sight.By ""decadent"" I'm not referring to a decline in morals. Yeah, way too much dirty language comes out of these youngsters' mouths. Once in awhile it is funny or otherwise purposeful, but usually just gratuitous. As Peter Hitchens wrote, some people use profanity for punctuation, and one suspects that it is the only punctuation they know. Never was there a sillier misnomer than calling it ""strong language."" It is actually weak language. And this applies to screenplays as well. Although I would not exaggerate it as a moral violation, it is a tangible example of decadence: a line has been crossed in a very cheap manner, after which what in this way can anyone do for an encore?Otherwise, this film is conspicuously moral. Look at the checklist. Racial equality, check: one of the three close friends among our young protagonists is African-American. Drugs, check: don't take them or deal them, and at least consider reporting anyone who does. Sex, check: get a girl's consent before making a move. And when you're eleven years old, daydream about giving a girl a kiss someday. Sweet.No, by decadence I have in mind an artistic crudity, insincerity, and shameless loss of subtlety and craft that eventually becomes a race to the bottom. After just five minutes I was thinking, ""this director doesn't know how to make a feature film."" But it's been awhile since I've even bothered to see a Hollywood movie on account of the same traits, so maybe he's a typical contemporary Hollywood director, how should I know? Am I just showing my age?The issue is style. First, the pacing is absurdly frenetic throughout. Second, these boys simply screamed much of their dialogue. Given the highly competitive market for child actors, I'm sure that casting came up with more talent than we see here-- if they didn't, it's sheer incompetence again. More likely, the star trio has talent but the director never brought it out of them. The occasional exceptions to the yelling appear in tender scenes, which come up abruptly: Suddenly the camera pans into a close-up and the music changes. Now This Is A Tender Scene, See? Then after a moment it's back to the razzle-dazzle rat-race. Put all this together and you get utter failure to suspend a viewer's disbelief. The effect is reminiscent of minimalist music which is obnoxious when it takes a moment that sounds like a symphony orchestra's reaching the climax of a score, and then repeats the passage twenty times, so that it all becomes a spoof.For those who enjoyed this movie: fine, more power to you, I won't hold it against you. But do you have any idea what a starvation diet you are subsisting on? Will another film about this age group ever rival Stand By Me (1986)? For my money, Hearts in Atlantis (2001) almost stands by it. Granted, Gene Stupnisky's aim in Good Boys was more comic. But even effective comedy requires having summoned some emotional involvement with plot and characters. If it's not irreverent to suggest comparing it against these two predecessors, doing so will make it obvious how signally he failed.",Good Boys

From having to score drugs to selling a sex doll, these kids get into all kinds of ridiculous hijinks that provide only a mild laugh now and again.My main problem here is the rehash. Why? ""Superbad"" is a far superior movie, probably because of the knowledge the characters bring to the table. These kids know next to nothing about the world, a fact that's played up to a maximum extent time and again. By the end of the movie, I was ready to throw my hands up in the air saying ""Alright!

195,chasemykleby,"Good Boys manages to balance hard-R comedy, with a heartfelt coming of age story.",9,16 August 2019,"""Good Boys"" Review
(9/10)It's no surprise that Universal's raunchy coming-of-age comedy feels like an aged-down Superbad, considering it counts Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg among its producers - and the main difference between the two films comes down to the youth and naïveté of its protagonists.
Much of the movie's comedy comes from the kids' adorable ignorance about the realities of adult relationships - which isn't particularly original, but ends up landing surprisingly well thanks to the talents of its precocious young stars. And as the boys find themselves in increasingly insane scenarios, writer-director Gene Stupnitsky, keeps a firm grasp on the pacing as the action escalates, managing to tie the whole thing together in a satisfying 90-minute runtime that never outstays its welcome.
Good Boys never comes across as preachy or trying to appear too ""woke,"" it just seems like a natural evolution of a comedic genre that hasn't always aged well - one that isn't content to go for the low-hanging fruit when something more subversive is more likely to earn a laugh. Despite some repetitive jokes and an over-reliance on putting its oblivious heroes in icky or dangerous situations, Good Boys more than lives up to its name.
Good Boys manages to balance hard-R comedy, with a heartfelt coming of age story, even with all the bad stuff they are doing, the film never loses sight of the fact that these are really nice boys.",Good Boys

202,Simply-Red,Hilarious and Raunchy,8,1 January 2020,"No need for me to get in to much detail of the movie, plenty of folks have already done that. I just want to chime in and wonder why people watch R rated movies, then are stunned by adult content? The ratings are there in order to be able to not only see the rating, but they also tell you what the content is, generally, and what the reasons for the rating are. Here on IMDB, when you search the movie, at the top of the result/movie page there is a selection for ""more"". Under that you will see ""storyline"" and under that you will see ""parents guide"" where people report things that may be undesirable for some.If you are a parent, or a sensitive adult, you should get in the habit of researching movies so you dont spend money and time being outraged and insulted. There are other web sites just for parents and sensitive adults to detail what is in a movie that may be objectionable. I research some movies and shows before watching them to see if there is content I might find objectionable, and there is some specific sexual content I do find objectionable.That said, for ADULTS who are not sensitive to vulgarity, this movie is hilarious. It shows kids in their innocence and ignorance, trying to be as adult as possible. It is the ADULT and older adolescent influences that even allow these 12 year olds to ""stumble"" on some very adult things...and that includes language. Kids arent born with foul language, but it is not that unusual for them to use it amongst themselves. Normal kids are always trying to do adult things...thats why they get in trouble when they get caught!Most non-sensitive adults will find the thoughts, beliefs, desires and behavior of the children in this movie to be very familiar, and while a bit over the top (It's supposed to be an outrageous movie!), the content of this movie will make people laugh because they can relate to it. There were a few periods where my attention was lost and I wasn't laughing, but thankfully I was able to pause the movie in order to not miss other stuff while I was still laughing at the last! At a few points we had to rewind just to make sure we saw and heard everything because it was coming so fast. This is why I dont go to movie theaters...no pause feature!",Good Boys

Yes, there are plenty of older ones (Porkies, for example), but in the most recent vein there are three: Superbad, Booksmart, and this one.

Tweens using the foulest of language, crude sex jokes and characters so stereotypically presented it boggles the mind. Only once have I ever walked out of a movie, and this trash nearly became the second one.This is formulaic to the extreme. Crude and offensive, the director uses underage children to perform vulgar material. It totally fails as a comedy, offering nothing new in the way of presenting humor, and when it tries to be a Stand By Me ripoff about ""coming of age"" themes it fails miserably.Sorry, folks, I can't ""fall out of my chair laughing"" as one reviewer put it by listening to tweens spew the worst sort of obscenities, seeing all adults presented as out of touch idiots and watching sixth graders go on a drug hunt.",Good Boys

Don't blame Hollywood or politics or society if you can't handle that or don't know how to talk to your kids about it. It's not the fault of a movie or its producers, writers or stars if you didn't research it before taking the family to a Saturday matinee. Remember ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" from 1967, with its shocking subject matter (for its day?) I bet some of your parents and grandparents reacted then the same way you are reacting now. Times change, what is socially acceptable changes and people change and grow - just like the characters in the hilariously written story.

There is some truth to this film and it definitely does have merit as cinema, at least in my opinion. If you can get past all of the crude humor and innuendo, you will find that the titular ""good boys"" are surprisingly innocent, at times sweet, and yes, even GOOD, especially compared to some of the adult characters and even some of the other kids in the film.Don't knock it until you've tried to, to quote another, eerily similar film (that even uses the same song in the trailer) released this year called Booksmart, which I have yet to actually see. It's a coming of age comedy film at it's core, take it for what it is. I didn't find all of the jokes to be funny, and it did at times feel forced and trying to hard to be ""mature"" but more often than that I found myself laughing, and at the end of the day, and seeing as how this is a comedy film, I can't really say that it failed to deliver, at least for me.",Good Boys

I've always liked those movies like American Graffiti and Dazed and Confused which took place in a 24-hour span. This one is probably bottom of the list though. It had it's moments that made me chuckle, but the actions of the kids was inconsistent, at times they acted like 18 year olds and other times acted like 6 year olds. The writers probably should've watched the first season of Wonder Years to see how 12 year olds really behave. Here, they knew every swear word in the book and even knew what cocaine was, but didn't know what a sex doll was and didn't know what kissing a girl involved. The performances from all the young cast members were really good though i have to say. But all in all, this is a watch only once type of movie.",Good Boys

This movie has children viewing porn, kissing a sex doll, speaking vulgarity, and playing with sex toys. It's just not right for the child actors to have been made to handle these sex toys by the adults making this movie. They tried to make cussing funny but failed. The story itself is just not interesting or believable even with the sub plot of the divorce.

The humour was completely inappropriate for the age of the movies main cast and some scenes made me cringe, not because they were bad but more so because as an adult it's more than a little wired watching a 12 year old talk about his ""big dick"". I must say though as inappropriate as it is I don't think I've laughed so hard and so consistently throughout a movie for a very long time. The conundrum here is that the movie works so well because of the age of the main cast and the adult humour. Lot's of people will be offended and cry about young people being objected to sexualised behaviours etc. and that's fine, I for one thought this movie was funny as and would definitely recommend it to my friends.

This is how it is and Good Boys tries to catch up some of such moments. I liked them a lot especially in the final part of the movie.The main plot is about three boys invited to a party, but they have never kissed a girl. So how to prepare for party games like ""spin the bottle""? Exactly. Use the internet or your father's drone to spy out the neighborhood haha ;) - This is where the fun begins. After some jokes and actions I really had to lough out loud.When you watch the movie with your kids be prepared, there is a lot of swearing, talks about drug use, some more or less funny sexual innuendoes and little use of alcohol. But nothing really explicite. In our country the movie is rated ""12"", ok in my opinion.So have fun watching but don't expect something really serious.

Going into the film I didn't expect much but the humor is constant, all the child actors give amazing performances, and there are multiple story threads that came together nicely. My biggest concerns were cringing at the kid actors and a weak plot but both didn't disappoint. The three main leads were hysterical and their character development came to a satisfying conclusion at the end. There were a surprisingly decent amount interesting plot points. Most moviegoers tend to not focus on a comedy films story but here it doesn't lessen the humor or slow the movie down at all.

I finally got to see it recently and 10 minutes in, I was thinking: ""Please, get better quickly"". At first, it was funny watching little kids drop the F-bomb, but then it just became stupid. The little twist where the African-American kid is the nerd and the Asian kid is the cool one, was wedged into the movie, but so be it, that's Hollywood. I just have to ask the question- who is the target audience for this movie? I saw it with my wife and 20-year old son and all of us hated it. Sure, there were a few laugh out loud moments, but there were way too few of them and the movie just spiraled downhill after a few minutes. I can't see little kids liking this movie, or even being allowed to see it, so I guess the only people I can see enjoying this movie are high school kids. Hey, I'm sure there are audiences that like seeing little kids drop the F-word every five minutes, play with sex toys, and get chased by high school girls who are trying to get their drugs back from them, so if that's what entertains you- and Seth Rogen is your hero, then this movie is for you.",Good Boys

257,rstarzecmoviecritic,Mehhhh,6,21 August 2019,"Whereas ""Booksmart"" from earlier this year was essentially ""Superbad"" but substitute women for the main characters, ""Good Boys"" is essentially ""Superbad"" but substitute tweens for the main characters. Instead of getting laid, the goal of Jacob Tremblay's character is to kiss a girl he likes at a house party, almost the same motivation as Jonah Hill's character in ""Superbad."" The other two members of the ""Bean Bag Boys"" have different goals compared to Tremblay's character, but in the end they are all still trying to go to a party, and the entire movie is as vulgar as the producers could possibly make it.""Good Boys"" has a very heavy theme of the need to fit in or be accepted by your peers in subtle ways. Tremblay's character, Max, does not really need to fit in since he is already accepted by the ""popular"" kids in his grade, but he does not know how to kiss yet, and he wants to be ready to do it correctly in front of other people. His friend Lucas has identity issues throughout the movie after Lucas learns that his parents are about to go through a divorce. This information is useful to set up quite a few jokes within the movie, but at the same time it is a serious issue that Lucas does not know how he is going to fit in with his two friends who have no idea what it is like to have divorced parents. Thor, the last ""Bean Bag Boy,"" is a joy to watch as he tries to prove his manhood time and time again, although at one point this means he has to lie about his interests. Thor is a young boy with a true gift for singing, but when the popular kids see him standing next to the audition sheet for the school musical, he crosses his name out and says someone else put his name down to mess with him. He is also cursed with the nickname ""sippy-cup"" to which he replies ""it's a juicebox"" which is such a great line in the movie.While the movie has good intentions with the three boys' character arcs, ""Good Boys"" just keeps pounding it into the audience's heads that it's a very R-rated movie involving tweens. There are constant jokes of the main characters having a poor understanding of certain sexual topics, including but not limited to Real Dolls, tampons, beads (they think it's pronounced ""uh-nahl"") and the list goes on. They also have a poor understanding of drugs, thinking that ""molly"" is the name of a girl when two older girls are asking for their drugs back. They keep hitting the same few jokes into your head throughout the movie, and it becomes a little tiresome. However, some unique humor does save the film from being monotonous - the funniest running gag in the movie has to be that Lucas for some reason always has to be brutally honest, even if it means getting in the worst type of trouble.""Good Boys"" is not a terrible comedy, but the humor could be more original and less repetitive than simply restating ""these kids do not know about sex"" over and over again. It is a joy to watch Lucas and Thor while Max, the ""main character"" is actually pretty boring (and to think, he is the only child actor who has already made a name for himself in this movie).6/10",Good Boys

262,wesleyarledge-86836,Absolutely Hilarious With A Heartfelt Message,7,17 August 2019,"Think back to when you were 12, back in the awkward days of middle school. Back when you were trying so desperately to be the ""cool kids"" along with your best friends. Everybody wanted to fit in.That's the main message behind 'Good Boys', a film that is just as laugh out loud funny as it is heartfelt. While the humor can be very raunchy at times, what with the boys getting into very adult situations like taking sips of beer, using a parents collection of sex toys as ""weapons"", accidentally making off with drugs in a stolen purse, and throwing around severe profanities, what makes the film so hilarious is their naive spirits and misunderstanding of what these adult things are.I found myself laughing hysterically in the middle of the movie, at some of these bizarre situations that these kids got in to, but then I remembered that we were all once curious and mischievous at one point or another in our childhood.The young actors really shines through and did a really fantastic job. Especially Jacob Tremblay, who played main character Max.All in all, this is one of the wildest, raunchiest, and craziest comedies I've seen in a really long time. But it was a really well put together story that is full of heart and hilarious humor. Fair warning though, because of the R rating and the adult themes and situations, even though there are kids in the movie this film is definitely NOT for kids! I promise you though, you will laugh for 90 straight minutes! If Seth Rogen's intention was to make a comedy about his experiences in Middle School, then I'd say he did a job well done! My sides still ache from laughing so hard!",Good Boys

But I must protest the hyper sexualization of children and this movie has it in spades. The Hollywood agenda to turn children into sexual perverts is out of control and worse than ever.

265,BigCinnamon,A lot to like,7,30 October 2019,"Apart from really basic storytelling that feels like it takes one too many homages from Ferris Bueller, the constant one-liners more than make up for the lack of original plot. There were barely a few minutes that ever went by without me at least cracking a smile at something delightfully naive, dimwitted or insulting the boys were saying to each other, and a lot of credit needs to be given to the boys' acting for the delivery of those lines.

Idk why people put that in movies now-a-days.I get vibes that someone wanted to film little boys acting feminine and playing with adult toys, as this happens throughout the whole movie.

276,nickrichardson-16919,POPCORN EMPIRE - Good Boys Review,3,6 September 2019,"""Good Boys is sporadically funny, but it quickly falls apart due to lazy writing, wonky plotting and repetitive gags... 3/10""Good Boys is a hard-R comedy directed by Gene Stupnitsky (Bad Teacher, Year One) and produced by Seth Rogen and company, responsible for films such as Superbad and Sausage Party. The film revolves around three 6th grade kids who are invited to a ""kissing party"". Since they have no idea what they're getting into, the three boys try to do some research and ""practice"" before the party. This quickly leads to trouble, and each attempt to fix things only digs them into a deeper whole. While the 3 leads have some decent chemistry, there's little they can do to support the thin material they're given to work with. Good Boys is sporadically funny, but it falls apart due to lazy writing, wonky plotting and repetitive gags.Warning: Spoilers Ahead!From the opening scene of the film, things seem off. The dialogue is bizarre and forced, especially from Max's father. He comes into Max's room and says he's proud of him for learning to ""sexually himself"". Yes, this really happens.In the first act, we get to know Max, Lucas, and Thor. While all three young actors do a solid job with the material, it can't save the thin characterization or repetitive jokes. There's a gag early on where Max brings out his dad's ""CPR"" doll to practice kissing on, but it's actually a sex doll. Not much later, Thor brings out ""weapons"" from his parent's closet, but they turn out to actually be sex toys.Many of the jokes follow this same copy-paste formula: The kids are presented with subject matter/objects that they misinterpret or misunderstand. The audience is more aware than the kids in most situations, so you could drop them into basically any scenario and the jokes practically write themselves. The film coasts along relying on the innocence and ignorance of kids as it's template for cheap punchlines, and it quickly grows tiresome despite an occasionally chuckle-worthy line.Good Boys reaches for an overarching tone of sentimentality and innocence, tossing in various topics that are common in coming-of-age stories, but they don't amount to much. The film touches on heavy concepts such as divorce, bullying, and self-acceptance, but these concepts are never fully realized or explored. The emotional beats feel unearned and underwritten.There's a sequence towards the middle where Lucas gets in a slapstick bike wreck and dislocates his shoulder. Afraid to go the hospital, Max and Thor decide to take matters into their own hands. There's multiple shots where Lucas's shoulder is clearly visible, and you can see that someone forgot to reattach the prosthetic prop-arm in between shots. Max and Thor decide to pull on Lucas's arm to fix it as he cries out in pain. As soon as his arm pops back into place, things go back to normal immediately, and Lucas sits upright and says ""my parents are getting divorced"". The scene changes from slapstick humor to childhood drama in a split second. This sequence is especially sloppy in its execution, with an abrupt, awkward tonal shift.Comedy has different appeals for everyone, so you may get more out of this movie than me. That said, it's practically indefensible as being a great film. It plays things too safe, doesn't have enough ideas, and none of the emotional beats ring true. There are some funny moments sprinkled throughout (the action sequence involving a paintball gun is extremely entertaining) but mostly, you've seen all of this before in better films. If you haven't, it'd be much more worth your time to seek them out instead of sitting through Good Boys in your local theater.3/10",Good Boys

289,shawnw007,I guess Jacob Tremblay is trying to switch out of his comfort zone...,4,25 December 2019,"So, I watched this film not expecting much and I wasn't disappointed. I've taught middle school for 18 years, so naturally, I was prepared for the crude and obscene minds of young 6th grade boys and their curiosity for perversion. However, I was still open for some amusement.The film's genre of comedy reveals itself right away: where laughs are basically generated from a mix of vulgarity and childhood naïveté. The fact that 3 males were chosen as protagonists rides along the ""boys will be boys"" cliché (had girls mirrored some of these same vile behaviors, the film would've damn-near been blacklisted. Just love the Hollywood double-standard).The problem is, the level of naïveté experienced by the boys does not seem consistent nor credible for that age group. For instance, the film opens with ex-5th grader Max watching his own variation of a simulated alien on his MacBook (he's even chanting expletives while watching), and yet, when the boys actually watch a porno online, they are suddenly grossed out by what they are watching. So which is it, then? In addition, the boys curse like sailors (I'd equate the extraordinary accuracy of their expletives to more of a high school proficiency, TBH), yet the kids can't even open a vitamin bottle? Oh...that's right! Because they're budding 6th graders, and the mode of comedy here is banking entirely on their level of immaturity.Not sure, but I think the formula would've worked had the children been older. But because the film constantly glorifies the youth of its protagonists (who are glorified Sesame Streeters, mind you), the expletives thrown like curveballs and the perversion of the jokes end up becoming tasteless. In other words, when your leads are portrayed too young, then the comedic elements don't seem that funny. It's like ""Bridesmaids"", but for 11-year olds. In addition, I'm not so sure which audience this film is trying to appeal to. Perhaps pre-pubescent teens? Older kids? Definitely not adults. I dunno. The jury is out on that one...",Good Boys

My god, I was tween in '90s, but even though a lot stuff changed, still, the way kids think, react and respond to social pressure is the same.

They remake classic 80s movies, or in this case try to replicate the crude humor that made some 80s movies hilarious, but they forget the most important ingredients: a good script and HEART. A lot of millennials and Gen Yers will likely proclaim this movie to be hilarious, because they desperately seek their Breakfast Club. But John Hughes is gone, and so are the crude but lovable characters that made those films work, replaced instead by ""caricatures"". The kid actors do their best, but the script and the direction let them down. This movie fails to generate more than a couple of decent laughs for anyone who expects more than modern, derivative, generic tripe.

Yes, there is drugs and alcohol and swearing. It is not ""academy award"" but there was some good acting and some comedic timing that had me laughing so hard I had to grab a tissue. There's parts that are raunchy but not in an over-the-top way and parts that are corny.

They are a talented trio for sure and they work flawlessly together.It could have just used one more run through the type writer, (maybe one less), as the jokes were thin, antagonists fail be be antagonists and the parents are little less than after thoughts.

The boys are the target of many a neighborhood bully and are wanting to make their own money so that one of them can have a TV set.
The film is at its best when dealing with inane situations. It struggles with its inevitable dramatic material; which presented in such a slapdash manner that it's hard ot understand the content delivery. Good Boys does leave an indelible mark as one of the most profane examples of dealing with pre-teen angst.",Good Boys
320,uplay-27875,Hilarious comedy,8,26 July 2020,"I very well put together comedy, very fresh writing that is hilarious at times , unknown actors that have definitely have passed the test.
Basis Of the story is a group of friends going into year 6 are growing up a different rates and new experiences are taking over , they face many obstacles , it's like an up to date version of stand by me without the dead body and a complete comedy.
A easy watch on a Saturday night .",Good Boys
321,coldenlamb,A good movie to not take seriously,7,22 August 2019,If you turn your brain off for this movie you might enjoy it. Definitely not a masterpiece far from it. Also a good coming of age story. It's like if Stand by me and Superbad had a baby you would get this movie. Good for a couple of laughs. That's all,Good Boys
322,p_liles,Poor acting always ruins a movie,4,22 July 2020,"SLIGHT SPOILERS""Believability"" is one of my top criteria for any show, movie, or series. Actors must make the audience believe they are the character. Sets must be believable. The writing / dialog must be believable. I can suspend logic for a good story, like aliens, or magic, or ghosts, etc.Recent examples of good child acting include: ""Stranger Things"" and ""It"".This movie (Good Boys) does not have believable actors. The lines are delivered stiffly. The writing is exaggerated to the point of not being believable. While the cursing wasn't necessarily offensive to me, it wasn't (generally) believable / natural either.One example of poor writing was when the boys were looking up how to kiss. They get online and the first thing they search for (inexplicably) is 'boobs'. When that didn't help, they go straight to 'porn'. When that didn't work, they gave up. So..... why didn't they search 'kissing'?While fairly extreme sexual content runs throughout the film, I felt they crossed the line a few times. The most egregious was probably when the boys practiced kissing a sex doll and one of them got a pube in their mouth. Another was when the frat guy was telling the boys to suck his $#&%. Just an extremely weird and uncomfortable exchange.Overall the production felt like a low budget TV movie. The story actually had potential. I just think it was not executed well. The subject matter (and age group) may make it more difficult to accurately execute, but that was the movie they chose.If you don't mind extremely crude humor, executed well at below a 50% mark, you may want to give it a try. If not, don't waste your time.",Good Boys
323,bensee-50800,"Funny and stupid, but a damn good time",7,24 September 2019,"Good boys tells the story of three boys in there tweens who are struggling to survive life in 6th grade. They struggle with normal school problems such as parental divorce, young love and trying to become cool. The boys will take one adventure that will make them grow as men and humans and also test there boundaries towards one another. The films take on how elementary school boys are very close to to the pressures of high school such as kissing and trying to fit in. Memorable performances by the three main actors including 'Wonder' actor Jacob Tremblay sells his performance as a struggling young kid just trying to fit and make his way in the world and have the courage to ask his female crush. This film is wickedly inappropriate, funny but overall a real damn good time.",Good Boys

Yet somehow, the whole time I watched this movie I couldn't help but feel cheated. It felt like a bad rip off of Superbad. In fact it was almost a replica of Superbad in pretty much every sense... but executed poorly. So if you didnt like Superbad you will almost certainly not like this one. And if you did like Superbad... just watch super bad and pretend they're all 10 years younger and you'll be much more happy, I'm sure.",Good Boys

I found the 3 boys as actors quite good and the quality of the writing was perfect. Not raunchy, just a little dirty like most kids their ages talk and act. I laughed quite hard at many points, but unlike other films of this nature, there is a nice emotional element to it that ties up very nicely at the end. I recommend this film to anyone who felt like they never fit in, who had a group of friends but still felt like they were on the outside of everything.",Good Boys

I don't want to spoil but I am going to talk about one part involving a frat house and another at the playground and it made me laugh so hard I was not bothered about story or anything like that with a comedy I go to it to laugh not watch this amazing story with some comedy in it. the only movie I let away with that is Forrest Gump. that is one for another day so there is not a great plot or character depth but I laughed a lot and I adore this movie so it gets a 9 out of 10 from me.,Good Boys

It looks exactly like a bunch of middle aged men, who know absolutely nothing about modern children, wrote a pile of meaningless dialogues involving everything they know about sex themselves, which isn't much. Next time just hire an actual sixth-grader to write the script, I'm sure he/she will do a much better job.

Every funny action was accompanied by an even funnier sentence. And on top of all that, this film has some message and meaning because it talks about friendship and growing up.
I really don't understand why this film is so underestimated. It is a comedy and comedy and drama cannot be evaluated in the same way. The purpose of comedy is not basically to throw the viewer into thinking about the meaning of life, but to entertain him. If it has a nice message (and this movie has it), then it's just a bonus.

The innocence of the children in the movie was what made the movie funny, and it was very relatable. It's nothing too bad, but it still gives me a great laugh. Everything seems pretty natural and the main group of characters (the three boys and the two teenage girls) seem almost real, and they actually act like how kids and teenagers do act now. The sense to grow up but still having those childlike things in you. If I had to sum the movie up. It would just be a sixth grade version of Superbad, because that literally is what it is. The movie was much of an adventure, and it made me laugh. So five stars.",Good Boys

Young Tremblay was the only actor I knew by name, and that was only because of Wonder. The Bean bag boys on the outside were simply three everyday kids, doing simple, everyday things. Just fifth graders evolving into sixth grade. That's on the outside. On the inside they were pretty much the same, until their backs were up against a wall. Then, look out... these boys became savage as hell. Mostly harmless, but savage nonetheless. That's where the fun really kicks in.

I understand that many 12 year old kids these days have dirty mouths and think about sex. I know I did but there is a time and a place for it and on the big screen is definitely not the place for it. Maybe it is ok to some parents to have their children behave this way but it's not fair to those who don't and it's definitely not fair to the children this age to be influenced by Hollywood to what's right and wrong or ok and not ok. Typical Liberal Hollywood. Trust me. I'm not meaning to be political but we all know that 90% of Hollywood is to the far liberal left and they have been showing their true colors these past few years. This coming from someone who supported that side for the last 35 years. The garbage in the media and the garbage in Hollywood is ruining our society!,Good Boys

I did not expect anything so compared to that it gave me a lot. Obviously it is interesting how your society changed in 20 years from the American pie.
Also the seen effects of the recent culturemarxism and social engineering: the #metoo, drug situatiob, the anti-bully commando is like the SS, the word-controlling when talking about women, perpetual asking for consent, men are portrayed as dumb, childish, pervert baffoons, the race mixing agenda...
Amazing how the new age humor planned to incorporate all this to show that polcorrect humor, spiced with vulgarity, profanity and surprisingly far-fetched sexual references can stand a chance against old fashined comedy.

Just put your brain in neutral, sit back, and enjoy the movie. You know ahead of time that you're going to an ""R"" rated comedy, so what should you expect? ""R"" rated comedy! It's not a social commentary. It's not a political thriller.These negative reviews seem to reinforce what Jerry Seinfeld said a few years ago about why he won't perform on college campuses anymore, ""I hear that all the time,"" Seinfeld said. ""I don't play colleges, but I hear a lot of people tell me, 'Don't go near colleges. They're so PC.'""Seinfeld says teens and college-aged kids don't understand what it means to throw around certain politically-correct terms.So, just go to enjoy it - Don't go looking for a reason to be offended and you'll have a good time.

So far seen 72 films this year at the cinema and have to say this is the funniest one I've seen of the year so far and I'd go back and see it a second time.Plenty of good scenes in the film but one of the favourites for me was the frat house scene but won't give anything away.If you like funny films then give this a try and you won't be disappointed but if you watch songs of praise this film isn't for you as you probably won't like the rude references",Good Boys

387,stormbraeker,I don't do this a lot but I had to for this movie.,7,9 May 2020,"Great comedy, if you like Seth Rogen kind of things this is totally for you. Kids swearing is one of the top things I've seen in negative reviews as a reason the movie sucks. Listen stop playing it good, you did it as a kid, I did it every kid in the world will swear just because their friends do and they think it's cool. It's no reason to shut down a laid back movie. Enjoy it for what it is. It's a movie go chill and have some laughs not citizen cane of 2019 give it a break.",Good Boys
388,derek-07606,This movie is genius regardless of what others are saying,9,24 October 2020,"Listen, I get it. This movie is an immature and dumb comedy. However, looking back at my 6th grade self this was the mentality and social interactions of my male friends and classmates. It wasn't pretty, was dumb, overly sexualized, and crude. This movie captured that perfectly! This movie is a victim of this reality because people don't think it's right to depict 12 year old boys in this matter. There are a lot of ""coming of age"" stories out there but they are sanitized. The reality is the way these boys live isn't sanitized and to this day we look back and say to ourselves ""that was stupid of me to do that"" or ""I sounded like an idiot"". We can debate how boys are raised and how we can allow this to happen, but I WAS that boy and it's the way it was and I'm sure still is for boys in that part of their lives . Call it a ""right of passage"" or the ""downfall of society"", this movie is an immaturely humorous but VERY true depiction of the truth. I wish more people would see this.",Good Boys
389,teoandreea-07655,The movie delivered what it meant to deliver,8,21 August 2019,"I can see that most of the bad reviews target the ""normalisation"" of such an ""outrageous"" teen behaviour; I understand why it can be debatable, but this is a comedy and gives a comedic spin to a subject that (weather parents like it or not) all teens are experiencing: awkward curiosity and transition to sexual/romantic/gender interest. And, an important aspect: it is clearly advertised for 15+ audience.Yes, it was cliche; it didn't present any innovative screenplay, some jokes were obviously hyperbolised, but: it was actually a hilarious film.
The comedic experience and overall journey throughout the movie was well written; the acting was good; the bond between the 3 bin bags members was quite well portrayed. I like that it carried also a message about friendship; the cast was well selected and diverse; the main characters were actually very strongly individualised which I think gave a big plus to the ""glue"" of the story.
Overall I would recommended for a fun trip to the cinema, but definatelly not a movie for a more conservative taste in comedies.",Good Boys

394,dsteed71,Funny and sweet,10,10 November 2019,Really enjoyed this. The right mix of funny and sweet. There is a gentle innocence to the Beanbag boys where a lot of the laughs come from.

399,ksbby,Consent. Real tween issues. Crude humor. Emotion. What more could you ask for in a movie?,10,23 May 2021,"It's funny to me how all the negative reviews are about the crude humor the child actors used and some of the situations they were put in. But for some reason none of those people also listed the positives. The boys are constantly saying to respect women in the movie, ask for consent, and the movie even has a scene where they defend a teenage girl from harassment. There is a deeper message above the F bombs and sex jokes. We all know tweens cuss with their friends and are trying to figure out things involving sexual themes and drugs. Every human has been through it which is why I related to this movie so much as an adult (and loved it). Topics such as divorce and dating are also relatable to tweens and adults alike. Please watch this movie because you seriously won't regret it.",Good Boys

402,jetson132,Superbad 2.0,8,29 August 2019,Honestly I never ignore a movie based on reviews and there was a lot of hate for this movie based on the majority of reviews.This movie in my opinion is not as funny as superbad but has some similarities obviously with seth rogan involved with this movie.The movie is not as dirty as people are leading it to be I've seen a lot worse than this I think a lot of those people reviewing this are strict angry parents that dont want to believe that their children will talk or act like that.At the end of the day this is a movie and the kids are actors that are paid to act. It's funny at times with a decent story and in my opinion something that people should not pass on if you want a good laugh.Hope this helps anyone !,Good Boys
403,jackie_carvajal,Not cool,1,25 February 2020,I was trying to find humor in it and it did have a couple of laughs but what drew the line for me was the kids actually wearing some of the sex toys. It bothered me that one of the boys was wearing a choker tied to his mouth. I'm a mom and maybe that's why I couldn't get behind this type of humor that involves pre-teen boys but it was disturbing to me and I had to turn it off.,Good Boys

This movie doesnt normalise this type of behavior, it shows a reality in a extream way and tells what you what your children are exposed to especialy in the age of internet when you are open to all types of content. To all worried parents or who fear of normalising these teen behaviors, Ignoring reality and what your kids will eventually get exposed to and not talking openly about these topics will be much more harmfull.",Good Boys
425,guthanos-26435,Pretty Damn Good.,7,18 August 2019,"Good Boys is a lot of fun, If you like Sausage Party (2016) or This Is The End (2013) then this movie will have you hooked throughout. Just like the movies I just mentioned, the humour isn't the smartest, it mainly consists of sex references and gross-out humour which can be hilarious if done properly. I can gladly say that the humour is improved upon since Sausage Party, and rather the main joke throughout the movie is that food is swearing, Good Boys manages to keep the swearing kids from becoming boring and repetitive by putting them in all kinds of hilarious scenarios which keeps the movie fresh and entertaining.Unfortunately the child acting can be quite atrocious at times, I understand that they are just kids but a lot of the line delivery could be fixed with just a couple more takes and practice, it made serious or important events feel a lot less meaningful and was rather distracting, however the acting from the three main characters for the most part are very good for kids.It's a lot of fun, and while it may not be a perfectly made movie, I can guarantee that most people will have a blast with it.",Good Boys

My main issue with this movie is probably how painfully mediocre all the jokes were. The only joke in the entire movie that actually got me to genuinely laugh was when they were in the frat house and the drug dealers talking to the kids x22; And the third kid goes ""what am I supposed to do just sit here"" and even as I'm writing this I'm realizing it wasn't the joke that was funny at all it was just the way it was delivered. The thing that made this movie even more painful was sitting in a theatre where every other person is laughing off like every joke is the funniest thing they've heard in years while I'm just sitting there awkwardly giving a chuckle every few minutes. Needless to say I don't think this movie was anything special at all and it really didn't help that my brother hyped it up as much as he did. The acting: not that anyone had anything to work with but every single scene felt at least a little bit corny and stupid. The cinematography: there was maybe one shot in the entire movie that I found interesting. The music: stock music for cheesy ""comedy"" films. God I really didn't like this movie. I think this is my lowest rates movie on here and the only reason I'm writing a review is because I'm bored on the ride home.",Good Boys

2. The main three kids has good acting, but everyone Else is just... no. They always feel like the other actors try and be 'hip', but in the end you are most likely going to forget every side character
3. Unforgetable personalitys. Only the main three you are going to remember, SPOILER: almost the damn same. Every other person is just... there.

Learning about sex is part of coming of age, after all. As to the scene one reviewer questioned about the boy throwing his arm out of joint, I did that a few years ago. Didn't know what to do as my arm dangled, so I pushed it back in place. Turned out I did the right thing. It works, though my doctor was kinda amazed that it worked so well.

The movie had very little to offer in terms of comedy (forget the writing and other stuff). 12-year old kids cussing is not enough for a movie to be a good comedy.

Maybe because it resonated with me at some level when I reached puberty?With an R rating, its subject matter is definately not for sensitive viewers. The movie is explicit in its language but to the naiveté of it's prebubscient characters trying to figure out what his parents sex toys are and getting it all wrong is just plain hilarious.You can see the production value in this film. It has some beautiful cinematic moments. A brave concept indeed but it's rather a big pill for many to swallow seeing it places kids into some very awkward and depending on who you are, very funny moments.

Humor shouldn't have to resort to being vulgar or crude or crass to be funny - and by the same coin, this movie could have been a sweet, warm family movie without all the shock value.Yanno.. when I was their age, I didn't talk or act like that.

I'll blame it mainly on the casting, they obviously found the best cast in Super Bad and every kid and teenager in this movie fell way short of that, but also the jokes in Good Boys were just not clever or funny either. I honestly was done halfway through but stayed to the end.",Good Boys
455,mattyjohnson-93742,Stranger things meets Superbad but with worse jokes and execution,5,26 October 2019,"This film had good parts and I laughed. Like the frat boy saying ""she dropped the charges"" and then getting shot in the face, that was really funny. Actually these kids all have amazing delivery with a special shout out to the black kid. But on the other hand some confusingly terrible jokes in there. The analbead thing was easily the worst; it has been done before, its never funny, they do it worse and they do it like 4 times in the film its embarrassing and along with the sex doll just bought the film down by 2 stars.There are some super relatable 6th grade things in this film, being cool vs being random, taking 4 sips of beer, being old enough to go to the skatepark, taking drug awareness campaigns seriously. But the emotional core (stolen straight from superbad) isn't relatable because none of us have that situation at that age. Instead you just drift apart without thinking too much about it because you're eleven and dont have the emotional depth to agonise like that.",Good Boys

While it had its funny moments, I found myself disappointed by what it could have been. Several of the jokes fell flat and the plot while somewhat believable, could have been better executed.I realize Lucas was supposed to represent the moral compass of the 3 boys, but I just wound up finding him a bit annoying. Normally when you get the opportunity to impress older girls at that age, you don't NARC on them.I would say it's worth a watch if you enjoy comedies, but don't expect something timeless like Superbad.",Good Boys

It was done for its intention, make all of us uncomfortable just like you were 12 years old again.

The F bombs were too obvious and manufactured seeing they had no idea how to use any other adult words but were fluent in F's but overall it had some funny moments, some hilarious moments and some moments which fell flat.",Good Boys

Yes it did have some funny parts however it was very disgraceful in its outrageous racially stereotypical depiction of an African-American boy. The producer and writers made the boy the most effeminate and weak boy I have ever seen. There was nothing solid about the boy. He screamed like a girl all throughout the movie. He kept doing and saying too much ultimate acting like an old and scared black woman. The boy even said that his mom was his best friend although he had a father in his home life. To make matters worse, someone decided that it was okay for the boy to have an old black man haircut throughout the movie which almost no African-American boy in today's popular culture wears that hair cut. I ultimately have to suspect that the producer of this movie has a strong negative opinion of African-American boys.",Good Boys

The most trivial of stuff could be a ""life mission"" for this age. But the plot seems to jump from one Roadrunner/Coyote situation, and one adult toy to another at the service of this ""mission"". Feels overstretched. Too much bread, very little butter. Throw in adolescence, peer pressure and all the tired ""growing up"" platitudes from a million other sources to humanize this Brickleberry-esque romp (Brickleberry was funnier and being animated-- less crass).I guess what could be oddly ticklish is seeing on screen the ""shocking"" vernacular used--but in hindsight: don't preteens talk like this amongst friends, groupies, enemies (in real life) ? I kinda did at this age, in the early 90s. We didn't have social media or Internet back then. So we are free-er I guess?

You may want to call me a boomer who has grown too old, but I went into this with a positive outlook after watching the redband trailer and found that the story was cute but the comedy wasn't there.

By the way everyone saying things like go watch an old movie like ""Sixteen Candles"" saying that is the way to make a teen/pre-teen comedy that's a dumb comment, it isn't gonna happen. The world is changing so fast do you think people who saw ""Lassie: The painted Hills"" ever thought they would see a movie like ""Weird Science"". All I'm saying is before you believe a review go look at what that person considers a good movie. I'm personally not gonna listen to a review by the kind of people that think "" Crazy Rich Asians"" is a good flick. The one thing I did realize about these new movies is I'm never watching more than one trailer again, including all the best jokes in the trailers does ruin the shock of it. I would of laughed so hard if I hadn't heard the punchlines already.

#1 they are already damaged # 2 it's ment for adults. #3 stop blaming tv and movies for the way kids turn out if parents can't teach real life from movies and tv that's on them. Not the director not the writer. the parent and the kid are to blame. #4 the reason the show is funny is because these were actually good kids who feel onto very funny and highly unlikely circumstances. Sure they say the f word to much but what do you think kids that age do when their parents aren't around..... they say the swear words and use them out of context. #5 if you dont like the movie fine just dont try and justify you having a stick up your ass to this movie will damage youth. hide a recorder in a tweens back pack and listen to what they actually talk about I'll bet it's way worse than what the kids in this movie said and I'll bet they haven't seen the movie yet.",Good Boys

Upon googling how old these kids were they hadn't even reached the ages of 11 or 12 when this movie was made. To the people who thought that this movie was soooooo hilarious is is funny because this is how you want your children to act or because you think it's cute. Anyone who found this MESS funny is disgusting and the parents of the little boys in this movies are a damn disgrace and don't deserve children. I used to love Seth Rogan but I think this  did it for me and I no longer respect the actor and writer he is.

The people here giving it 1-star are making moral judgments, not giving a movie review.Personally, I found it funny as hell. The young actors deliver a believable and energetic performance that left me in stitches. My only complaint would be the writers seem to try a little too hard to push the boundaries and a few scenes in the movie feel a bit over the top, even given the movie's premise. That said, would most definitely recommend, as long as you can leave your stuck-up morality at the door.",Good Boys

Poor across the board.They go on a pursuit to replace the drone when there was never any clear reason why the girls needed to hold onto it in the first place.

594,takiboti,You won't laugh (very mild spoilers),4,12 May 2020,"If I had to sum up the movie, I'd say it's a bunch of unfunny kids annoyingly screaming as loud as they can for 90 minutes - of course it isn't the actors' fault, rather the directors'. The writing is also lame and the editing sometimes doesn't make sense (and it's a bad thing I didn't get invested in the story enough to not care about bad editing). Obviously, the inevtiable huge problem between the main characters and their separation happens at the end of the second act and not only it comes out of nowhere, it is also incredibly irrelevant. I think the overall presence of this movie fails to be needed. It can't possibly find its audience because the entire thing is made for ages 15+ or 16+, which means people who are actually able to watch the film cannot possibly relate to the problems of three eleven year olds. If you want a GOOD 'Superbad' inspired comedy from last year, go watch 'Booksmart' instead. The two movies don't even have comparable qualities.",Good Boys

Overall it had a fun, lighthearted feel. However, the pacing, story structure, and establishment of a central theme were pretty awful. The whole movie felt like it moved way too fast, not giving each plot point/idea the time it needed to be meaningful and get us to care for the characters. It didn't feel like there was a clear goal in mind when they wrote the story, just one silly thing happening after the other with no real purpose and then some semblance of a life lesson thrown in out of nowhere at the end. In the end the laughs and good vibes of the movie were not enough to save a poorly structured and meaningless story.",Good Boys
618,ghieth-13856,Good,10,6 December 2019,This movie contains a light comedy and a light adventure worth following the parents and not the kids,Good Boys
619,sinredml85,At very least a solid 7,8,11 March 2021,"Let me start with saying i am not a comedy guy. But this one was special. The naivity of the characters is the driving motor of humour, and the script managed to be hilarious but still not completely cheesy.
The actors are great, the humour is spot on and i honeslty do not know what kind of people who would actively downvote this one. It is a solid good comedy, nothing more and nothing less",Good Boys
