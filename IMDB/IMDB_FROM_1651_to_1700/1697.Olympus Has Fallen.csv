0,TheLittleSongbird,"Mediocre, but much better than its awful successor 'London Has Fallen'",4,1 October 2016,"'Olympus Has Fallen' is not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but judging from the reviews was honestly expecting much worse. Even for taking it for it is and aimed to do, it could have been much better.This said, it is much better than its successor 'London Has Fallen'...now that was an awful film, with no obvious redeeming values, and one of the worst films from that year. 'Olympus Has Fallen' at least tried to be fun and has much better action scenes (such as the audaciously staged terrorist attack, all of the action in 'London Has Fallen' is routine at best).It also looks better, apart from some excessive shaky cam in places and the special effects are far from brilliant, in fact cartoonish and fake, but there is some atmospheric grit and the film is well shot instead of mostly looking like SyFy/Asylum fodder. With the exceptions of an annoying Melissa Leo and Aaron Eckhart phoning it in, the acting is not bad here with dignified Angela Basset and particularly Morgan Freeman giving the best performances. Gerard Butler does struggle with some of his one-liners, which honestly are not that good (pretty pithy actually) in the first place, but is a very capable action hero and charismatic lead. Rick Yune does his best, but his character is forgettable and very sketchy, like all the characters here. The direction at least has some tension.However, 'Olympus Has Fallen' goes for the fast, big and loud approach, sometimes that's not a bad thing but it didn't come off well here. The pacing is rather rushed often, while also losing momentum in crucial parts too, while the big and loud like its sequel is so constant there is little room to breathe and it becomes nauseating and repetitive in every way possible.Much of the script consists of pithy one-liners and cheesy quips that feel like clumsy attempts at humour, while also making little to no attempt at giving much personality or development to the characters (leaving the actors to do all the leg work and they mostly do credibly in that respect). The story is certainly not as intelligence insulting as that of 'London Has Fallen', but while it tries not to be too derivative of 'Die Hard' it is not that original and it outside of the action lacks suspense and proper excitement which are mistaken for lapses in logic and lack of suspense.All in all, not great, instead a mediocre film, but not as awful as expected. Even with its numerous flaws, if asked which is better between 'Olympus Has Fallen' and 'London Has Fallen' the answer is clear. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Olympus Has Fallen
1,bkoganbing,Doesn't say much for security,5,2 April 2013,"With military like precision a group of North Korean terrorists attack and take over the White House and hold the POTUS Aaron Eckhart hostage. The group is led by John Yune and they've got so much sophisticated hardware and knowledge that despite North Korea's denials, ain't no way they have no hand in this. Given the current round of saber rattling from the newest dear leader Kim Jong Un, the film Olympus Has Fallen has a timely meaning to it. When will the world and specifically the powers around North Korea ever going to do something about that particular global cancer?However there is Gerard Butler in the mix, a man formerly in charge of the White House Secret Service detail who is former Special Service and won't quit until he's rescued the people he's grown to know like the president and his son, young Finley Jacobsen.All this takes place with Yune getting in there as part of the security detail of the South Korean prime minister who is meeting with Eckhart about the perennial North Korean problem. The prime minister gets assassinated and then Yune presents his list of demands. There's also a traitor in the President's official family.Butler turns out to be a regular Rambo. Sly Stallone and Arnie Schwarzenegger never displayed as much skill and resilience as Butler does. All this while taking direction from acting President Morgan Freeman who is the Speaker of the House of Representatives.Action fans will probably love this film. But if security is that bad then Washington, we have a problem",Olympus Has Fallen
2,Leofwine_draca,Best Die Hard rip-off in a good while,7,17 January 2014,"Forget airs and graces here: OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN is a straightforward siege-based action flick, heavily indebted to DIE HARD and its ilk, offering maximum thrills and spills and little else besides. It's hardly a thinking man's movie but it does ably do what it sets out to do, which is to offer plenty of action, high stakes and suspense.The story is, in essence, DIE HARD in the White House and there's no more or less to it than that. Gerard Butler is good value in the action stakes (as we already know from 300, so it's a shame he's been wasting away in dumb rom-coms ever since) and the intricate plot sees a huge squad of terrorists kidnapping the President (an unlikely Aaron Eckhart), leaving Butler the only man on the ground with the power to stop them.The action consists of a handful of brutal hand-to-hand fights and shoot-outs augmented with some CGI stuff of plane attacks and missiles; the CGI isn't great but it's better than you'd find in a B-movie at least. Morgan Freeman shows up as one of those guys whose business it is is to offer sage advice and look worried in equal measure, while Rick Yune tackles the role of lead North Korean terrorist with relish.OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN isn't perfect by any means; it's occasionally cheesy, occasionally silly, and mostly far-fetched. It could also do with some more action, what there is is a little limited considering the running time of two hours. But it IS a perfect piece of action entertainment, the kind of switch-off-the-brain fun that I look out for in a movie.",Olympus Has Fallen
3,SnoopyStyle,Really stupid but fails even if you turn off your brain,4,22 August 2013,"Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is a disgraced former Presidential guard. In the opening, he fails to save the first lady even thought he is able to rescue President Asher (Aaron Eckhart). While hosting the South Korean Prime Minister, the White House is attacked by overwhelming forces of North Korea. The South Korean party is infiltrated by terrorists led by Kang Yeonsak (Rick Yune) and double agent Dave Forbes (Dylan McDermott).Coming at the same time, this was going to be compared to 'White House Down'. That movie has the saving grace of trying to be funny knowing full well how stupid it is being. This one takes it much too seriously. It seems that they were the only one who didn't know this is supposed to be a stupid popcorn flick. The action is unbelievable but depressingly constant. There are no breaks to add any jokes. If this is a realistic film, the serious tone may be fitting but nobody can take any of it seriously. For a shoot them up action movie, the serious tone just accentuates all the silly problems. None of the characters are reasonable or believable in the post 9/11 world. Many characters are doing cringe-worthy things. The plot is hopeless. This is a failed White House Die Hard.",Olympus Has Fallen
4,Prismark10,They call me Bruce,6,18 August 2013,"This is Die Hard in the White House. You actually think that this was a script that Bruce Willis rejected.As for the President of the USA in this movie. I think the people of America would had been safer if Leslie Nielsen's Frank Drebin was elected as President.Aaron Eckhart must be the most boneheaded president ever put to the silver screen. He is also darn unlucky as well as thick.He is not helped by his aides and advisers. The head of the Army played by Robert Forster should be sent back to summer school. He lacks any military intelligence. Only the Defence Secretary had balls and that part was played by a woman.However Gerard Butler manages to keep the film going doing what only Bruce Willis does best, taking on the villains single handedly.",Olympus Has Fallen
5,claudio_carvalho,Great Action Movie,8,10 August 2013,"After a car accident where the First Lady dies, the Secret Service Special Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is disgraced and transferred to the bureaucratic service. When the White House is under a terrorist attack, President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) is kidnapped by the terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) and Banning breaks in the place. Now he needs to save the President's son that is chased by the terrorists that wants to use the child to force Asher to give the access code to a powerful weapon and then to rescue the president from Kang. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is a great action movie with good story and direction and top-notch cast. The plot is tense and holds the attention of the viewer until the very end despite the stupidity of the American president that orders his collaborators to give their secret codes to the enemy. The trailer shows practically the storyline. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Invasão à Casa Branca"" (""Invasion to the White House"")",Olympus Has Fallen
6,nogodnomasters,DIE HARD RED DAWN,8,17 April 2018,"Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) is president. Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is his secret service body guard who has fallen from grace. In this film the North Koreans, disguised as South Koreans, take over the only bunker in the country that controls nuclear missiles with self destruct instructions (if there is such a thing). Just so happens the three people who know the three separate codes are there too.Only Bruce Willis (the younger one) or a reasonable facsimile that looks like Gerald Butler, can save this country. Morgan Freeman plays the ineffective Speaker of the House who becomes president when things go badly.Plenty of action. On the film scale: better than ""Red Dawn"" (new one). Not as good as ""Die Hard."" Of course it is better than the recent ""Die Hard"" offering unless demolition derby is your thing. Improbable script, but the characters and action made this formulaic film worth viewing.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.

7,kosmasp,Another White House movie,8,30 August 2013,"Before I had the chance to watch ""White House Down"" this came along first. So maybe this is an advantage (only Hollywood knows how they are able to do two similar movies and release them almost at the same time), I will know when I have watched the other movie. What I can say though, this takes no prisoners (well they do in the movie, but you get my drift hopefully).It is very uncompromising and Gerald Butler is able to carry the movie through. Die Hard style and in a fashion that should make McLane proud! Always something witty to say (but not PC or PG for that matter). You either like the very ""Gung-Ho"" style of the movie or you'll hate it. The action is shot in very good fashion. Is it predictable? Does it have clichés? Check both of those boxes, but is it also a lot of fun if you let it and does exactly what it promises too (with a lot of violence in it and swearing)? Check that box too and it's up to you to decide if this is something for you",Olympus Has Fallen
8,lee_eisenberg,"""Air Force One"" transposed to the White House",2,24 August 2013,"Antoine Fuqua had already directed two movies before ""Training Day"" got him some notice (and won Denzel Washington a Best Actor Oscar). Since then all of Fuqua's movies have been total popcorn movies. The latest is ""Olympus Has Fallen"", which is basically everything that we saw in Wolfgang Petersen's ""Air Force One"" transposed to the White House. Terrorists have taken over? No problem! One person single-handedly takes them on.Yeah, I know. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't. Sorry but there are stories that haven't gotten filmed. This is just a DUMB movie. I'd like to see an adaptation of Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Years of Rice and Salt"". And I'd like to see Michael Apted's ""Stardust"" and Jack Starrett's ""Gravy Train"" (both of which got released in the theaters but never got released on VHS) get released on DVD.",Olympus Has Fallen
9,jboothmillard,Olympus Has Fallen,5,21 April 2013,"I saw trailers, interviews and clips for this film in the cinema and on television, it looked like a good fun action romp, maybe in the same region as Air Force One, so I was definitely willing to give it a go, from director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, King Arthur, Shooter). Basically former U.S. Army Ranger Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, also producing) used to lead Secret Service agent for U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), but this changed after the Presidential car crashed during a snow storm off a bridge, and he could only save the President, but not the First Lady Margaret Asher (Ashley Judd). Eight months later he now works within eyesight of the White House for the Treasury Department, and on a day the President is meeting South Korean Prime Minister Lee Tae-Woo (Keong Sim), Asher and other officials are held at gunpoint by Korean guerrilla forces and taken down to the bunker while the building is attacked. Agent Roma (Cole Hauser) alerts head of Secret Service Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) that ""Olympus has fallen"" before he is killed, and with the President in danger the Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) is appointed Acting President during the crisis. The leader of the terrorists reveals himself on screen, ex-North Korean terrorist Kang Yeonsak (Die Another Day's Rick Yune) is demanding that U.S. troops are pulled out of the Korean Peninsula, which would allow the civil war to end, and if these demands are not met he will access the three codes that will detonate all nuclear weapons in all American silos. While one by one some of the staff and officials in the bunker are being killed so that the codes for missile system Cerberus are given out, Banning has snuck into the White House after all the explosions and gun fire, and he is trying work his way towards the bunker. He is able to maintain contact with both the officials listening to the terrorists, and he can communicate with Kang below in the bunker as well, and there is one point when traitorous ex-US Secret Service agent Dave Forbes (Dylan McDermott) fights his former friend, but does convince the villain he has killed him before dying. Kang manages to order more forces from outside to attack the White House further, including helicopters with rapid fire machine guns, and Banning causing them to crash means more explosions, and this causes Army General Edward Clegg (Robert Forster) to keep thinking that they should go ahead with the ransom demands. Banning manages to cut off Kang's communications to the outside, and they meanwhile let out Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan (Melissa Leo), who was beaten up very badly for her code, but before she can be assassinated she gets rescued, and the terrorists meanwhile are getting ready to make the final move. The forces are taken out of the Peninsula as demanded, and the terrorists cover themselves in hoods along with the President and remaining staff alive to get into a helicopter they ordered, and this is blown up, but the good guy inside realises they faked it to sneak out of the White House elsewhere, while also activating the Cerberus weapon system. Banning manages to get to the terrorists and kill the henchmen, and he and Kang get into a knife fight, and of course like he said he would Banning stabs Kang in the head, and he manages to stop the Cerberus detonations just in time, and in the end rescued President Asher welcomes him back as head of the Presidential Detail. Also starring Radha Mitchell as Leah and Finley Jacobsen as Connor. Butler is a good choice as the action man who will go into the danger zone to rescue the President, Eckhart is a sensible choice to be the President of the United States, Freeman could have been given a little bit more to do, and Yune is your typical pantomime villain with the mad idea to blow up America. This film has a lot of reference to a crisis in North Korea, and at the time of release this was true to life as in real life North Korea was threatening missile attacks on America, and we know what has happened in the past with terrorist attacks, so in some ways this did seem a realistic drama. The concept is possibly a little predictable in places but all in all done with aplomb, the explosions and guns blazing sequences are all spot on and happen at a good pace, and it certainly keeps you engaged with its over the top set pieces, a good fun action thriller. Worth watching!",Olympus Has Fallen
10,paul_haakonsen,Quite entertaining actually...,7,24 December 2015,"While ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is an entertaining and thrilling movie, it does however run on stereotypic fuel; one man who save the day and saves all of America.The story is compelling and fast paced, right from the very beginning. And it keeps its high tempo right up to the end. Sure there were some very predictable moments and situations that even a blind man saw coming a mile away. But despite that, director Antoine Fuqua managed to put together a wholesome entertaining movie.The action sequences are good and well executed, coming off as believable, despite it being one man against 28. And the way that these sequences were filmed just puts you right there in the action.As for the acting, well, with a cast as this, you know that you are getting your moneys worth. Gerard Butler really carried the movie quite well. The movie also brandished talents such as Aaron Eckhart, Dylan McDermott, Angela Bassett and Morgan Freeman.If you enjoy action movies then you should sit down and watch ""Olympus Has Fallen"", if you haven't already seen it, because it is quite entertaining.",Olympus Has Fallen
11,blanche-2,"big production values, but that's about it",5,1 January 2014,"I just hope the White House is better able to defend itself than what we saw in this film.Olympus Has Fallen is a 2013 film that is nonstop action, with a very powerful beginning. As soon as we get into the real plot, it heads swiftly downhill. The first part of the film shows us how a member of the secret service, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) lost his job and ended up doing paperwork at the Treasury Department. In the incident that caused him to lose his job, I wonder what it was that they expected him to do because as far as I could see, there wasn't anything.Well, one day, while Mike is pushing papers, North Korea flies into White House airspace like they're out for a Sunday ride and attacks the White House. And guess what? The White House can't defend itself. It's ill-equipped. Now, say it ain't so because I never saw anything like it.Not only that, you could kill Americans, but every time someone shot at a North Korean, nothing happened. They just kept coming like they were all Superman or something. The Secret Service gets the President (Aaron Eckhart) into the bunker but alas, they also took the Korean prime minister with whom he was in a meeting, and it turns out that his guards as well as one of the secret service are all in on it and take everyone hostage.Now it's time for Mike Banning to learn what's going on and hustle over to the White House to see what he can do to help. Turns out, he can do plenty. No one else can. He is a one-man army.In the ""control"" room (and believe me, they have no control) is the acting president. For this role, one of our finest actors, Morgan Freeman, collects what is undoubtedly a very lucrative paycheck and just calls this in. A chimpanzee could have done what he did. Angela Bassett plays the Director of the Secret Service. She doesn't have much to do, but she is at least present. Melissa Leo is the Secretary of Defense and has a very flashy role which she does extremely well. Robert Forster is a General - again, not much to do. Obviously a huge budget for top-notch people to act in this dumb story.This film has more holes than a piece of Swiss cheese. If you must see it, watch it for the effects.",Olympus Has Fallen
12,Quinoa1984,God Bless the United States of Fun-Stupid Conservative action movies,7,26 March 2013,"Like Milius' Red Dawn (though not quite as accomplished technically), it's both completely indefensible substantively and yet a very enjoyable action film all the same. It knows what it is - jingoistic, idiotic drivel - but it's well shot and competently acted idiotic drivel if that makes sense. Fuqua, in the mold of Milius, really has his heart-thumping loud and proud as an All-American, but he injects real red-meat and vigor into his direction of the action, which has its chaos but is never hard to follow or disorientating (or it's more controlled chaos to put it another way). Gerard Butler is... as good as he can be, which means he's alright, as an action hero for the first time in a while, and more believable than a Leonidas or whatever. Aaron Eckhardt was just one second away from accidentally yelling ""RACHEL!"" ala Dark Knight. And Morgan Freeman looked mostly tired, but could still command the screen better than half the rest of the people in the room save for Robert Forster. Oh, and did I mention this movie has a lot of logical gaps (Dylan McDermott's character, for example), and the CGI, such as when a certain rectangular monument is destroyed for no real reason except for cinematic eye-candy, looks so awful that your Windows 95 screen-saver was more convincing? There is that. Olympus Has Fallen has an innumerable body count, effectively nasty-cum- stock villains, dialog that is to-the-point and story driven (even if that story, again, can be pretty stupid, and when it comes to those nuclear launch codes really needs a Dr. Strangelove in a wheelchair to come in and explain it to the Pentagon people), and I had a fun time watching the violence ensue. Perhaps when stacked up against actual bulls**** like Taken 2 or a Die Hard 5, its cinematic sins are slightly less egregious- it borrows from other films, liberally one might say (a little *original* Die Hard here, Air Force One there, any given hostage- crisis flick there, oh and how about most 24 episodes crammed into the climax), but somehow it trusts its audience to either be dumb enough to enjoy the ride, or that the smart people know its dumb but can enjoy its own dumb logic on its own terms. In other words, it's patently absurd, and all it's missing is a bald eagle to swoop in at the end to congratulate the heroes.",Olympus Has Fallen

18,neil-476,"Fun, but astonishingly silly",7,19 April 2013,"It was a dark and stormy night, and ace Presidential agent Mike Banning saves Aaron Eckhart's President Asher as the Presidential limo slips over a bridge into the icy river beneath, but fails to rescue Mrs Prez (Ashley Judd in a blink-and-you'll-miss-her cameo).

Which is why he is not there when North Koreans invade the White House and take Asher off to the bunker below, for their own nefarious purposes. Fortunately, he arrives shortly thereafter in order to do various rescue-y things.This film - which I enjoyed, lest there be any doubt - is big dumb fun, with an emphasis on the ""dumb"". It is almost as much fun spotting the cliché idiocy which abounds in this movie as it is watching the events themselves unfold. I feel sure that there are about nine million protocols in place to prevent any part of what happens in this film happening in real life, but even when you are working hard to suspend your disbelief you must surely spot the presence of these old friends:Selective ammunition (baddie ammunition much more effective than goodie ammunition in initial assault, Banning ammunition 100% effective, baddie ammunition 100% ineffective thereafter).Idiot military boss (Robert Forster makes every bad tactical decision possible, except for - ) Saying one thing, doing another (Forster firmly takes the ""no negotiating with terrorists"" position - the only time he is right - whereas everybody else says it, but then does what the terrorists want with no argument. Except that the President allows Secretary of Defence Melissa Leo to take a resounding beating before telling her to give up her password. If he was going to do that anyway, why didn't he do it before her beating?) Preposterous initial raid (good fun action, but no air challenge until the White House is in sight?

20,ferguson-6,Adventures of Superman,7,25 March 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Gerard Butler doesn't always make wise decisions when picking his projects. In the right role, men admire him for being cool and tough, while women are enchanted with his charm. The role of Secret Service Agent Mike Banning is just about perfect for Butler. He not only gets to be an action hero, but he also has a strong relationship (with Radha Mitchell) and is a role model for the President's young son. Butler is so nearly perfect here, he should be cast in the next Old Spice commercial.The movie starts out with the backstory on how Agent Mike Banning (Butler) fell out of grace with the President and was reassigned to a desk job at Treasury. Pushing paper is like Siberia for a man of Banning's make-up. A terrorist invasion on the White House tosses Banning right smack in the middle of a violent and explosive act designed to leave the entire United States decimated. Circumstances being what they are, Banning is the only hope.Movies like this must have a quality bad guy. We get icy Rick Yune as Yang, a North Korean criminal mastermind. You might think this is extremely timely given the real world in North Korea, but Yune is certainly no Governmental official. The attack is very well planned and leaves Yune locked in the White House security bunker with the President, Vice President and Secretary of Defense (a spunky Melissa Leo). At the Pentagon, this leaves the Secretary of State (Morgan Freeman) and a bombastic General (Robert Forster) jockeying for control. Angela Bassett is there to referee. While this group of officials sits around looking anxious and worried, Agent Banning is a one man wrecking crew against the terrorists.The images of the White House being attacked will prove quite disturbing to any US citizen and the sequence comes off as something that could possibly occur. Let's hope director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) performed sufficient research to know this attack couldn't actually happen. Still, Aaron Eckhart is a believable President ... in the Harrison Ford mode, tough as nails but also intelligent.There are of course similarities to Clint Eastwood's 1993 film In The Line of Fire, and many are comparing it to the 1988 classic Die Hard. For me, the difference in Gerard Butler's Mike Banning and Bruce Willis' John McClane is that Butler is the right guy in a bad place, while McClane was a good guy in the wrong place. The action sequences in Olympus are even bigger than Die Hard, and it's certainly clear there is much more at stake.The cast also includes Dylan McDermott and Ashley Judd. Without giving anything away, I'll admit this is my favorite Ashley Judd role of all time. It will be interesting to see how this one compares to Roland Emmerich's White House Down, which comes out in June. The story lines are almost identical with WHD starring Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx. Olympus Has Fallen is a very satisfactory action movie and Butler has re-established himself as a real movie star. It's doubtful Emmerich's version will stand up against this one.",Olympus Has Fallen

To help retake the White House, save the President and stop an even bigger disaster. While all the while being watched by Luscious Fox and Tina Turner....When blatant rip off of Die hard comes out the same year as a Die Hard sequel and does better critically and commercially, you have to ask yourself a question. Was it really that good, or were my expectations lowered because of the lack of a decent action film for so, so long.Well the evidence is all there. The Last Stand was good, but it was low key, so doesn't really count. Bullet to the Head was Boring, and I still refuse to see AGDTDH, until it's released the way we were intended to see it, not FOX's way. And the less said about G.I Joke, the better.Back to this film. It's a hybrid of Air Force One, In The Line Of Fire, Die Hard, and strangely, it feels a lot like Under Siege and Cliffhanger. The opening sequence mirrors Cliffhanger as in the hero loses someone who is close to a friend/Colleague, and sets the film up for Butler getting back on track.And literally fifteen minutes after that scene, it's full on action, and it's good for the most part. One liners are there but used very sparingly, Eckhart and Mcdermott are brilliant and Butler is Butler as always.Yune and Mitchell are sorely underused, and Freeman and Bassett are as reliable as they ever are.For a fun movie, you can do a lot worse, even though it's way too patriotic.Just don't be surprised if in a few years when you catch it on TV, it wasn't as good as you first thought.Lowered expectations.But for now, I think it's the best action movie of the year so far.",Olympus Has Fallen
22,gradyharp,'It takes fifteen minutes for your armed forces to reach the white house. We took it down in thirteen.',7,20 August 2013,"Antoine Fuqua has given us Training Day, Shooter, King Arthur, etc and has proved he knows his way around visceral action films. And if non-stop 2 hours of killing is your cup of poison then this film has that and more. The frightening aspect of viewing this film is the current focus on security leaks, the failure of misplaced intervention in other country's wars, the concern about China's and North Korea's and Russia's response to US actions over the Snowden matter, and the continued random appearing terror attacks throughout the world and terrorist-like attacks here at home that add a degree of credibility to what in previous years would seem like an absurd story. It is food for thought - or for tweeting...When the White House (aka ""Olympus"" according to Secret Service Code) is captured by a Korean terrorist mastermind (Rick Yune) with his cast of thousand assistants and the President (Aaron Eckhart) is kidnapped, disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who still reels with the guilt of not having saved the President's wife (Ashley Judd) in a tragic car accident, finds himself trapped within the building. As our national security team scrambles to respond, they are forced to rely on Banning's inside knowledge to help retake the White House, save the President and avert an even bigger disaster. The White House staff who escape into hiding to observe the derring-do include Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the House cum interim President, Secret Service Director Angela Basset, General Clegg as portrayed by Robert Forster, and traitor par excellence Forbes (Dylan McDermott) and the others in the cast include Radha Mitchell as Banning's wife and Finley Jacobsen as his young son Connor and Melissa Leo as the tortured Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan.Where the story (written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedkt) falls apart is the failure of security and military measures designed to protect the Whit House during such situations. Hopefully in reality it is not that crude and mismanaged! Not a bad action film (it keeps you watching closely for 2 hours) but a bit to phony in its patriotic ending. Grady Harp",Olympus Has Fallen
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Olympus Has Fallen,7,10 April 2013,"The release timing cannot be more coincidental than it already is, with the movie's marketers quickly jumping onto the bandwagon to link this to a potential what if given the current North Korean crisis, with the hypothetical scenario of their clandestine forces somehow making its way into the USA, and doing the audacious with the taking over of the White House, with no less than the President (Aaron Eckhart), amongst other political stakeholders being hostages.Can this really happen? I suppose it's only possible in Hollywood, with writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt taking plenty of artistic and dramatic license to craft something remotely possible through well orchestrated attacks that must be completed within 13 minutes, coupled with plot elements contributing to the loopholes, which you must suspend disbelief with in order for it to work, consisting of a combination of suicide bombers, swarmed armed assaults, a large cargo plane, and inside jobs turned ugly. Gone were the days of the Russians and the Arabs as enemies on the silver screen, with the North Koreans making the ultimate jump from one of the Bond installments, to the reboot of Red Dawn, and now this.So in true action-adventure fashion, a hero must rise from his rut, given a second chance which he will take to prove himself once again that he's the nation's only hope. But this is not John McClane's show, although director Antoine Fuqua's film could have been positioned as the next Die Hard installment set within Washington, D.C. and the White House. Similar to Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire, the film's protagonist is Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), the US President's chief detail Secret Service agent until the incident seen in the trailer had him step down from his position, to serve in a desk position in the Treasury. Like all heroes, he's never far away from the action, misses it in his life, and gets thrown the opportunity to take it back again by the horns.As much as this film featured its fair share of blood and violence, with the North Koreans led by international fugitive Kang (Rick Yune), a sadistic killer who doesn't flinch from executing his threats, there really isn't much of a danger posed toward Mike. There's the requisite wife Leah (Radha Mitchell) to provided narrative pause in the action sequences for Mike's extremely little bit of a human connection to a loved one, and with enemies never really threatening when getting in the way of our hero. Sure, Fuqua does design and shoot some intense battle sequences, but nothing was left remotely memorable as Butler huffs and puffs his way too easily through the long corridors and secret passages of the centuries old presidential quarters.Some simple twists and turns got utilized to spice up what would be an average plot with piqued interests because of the effort gone to recreate both interiors and exteriors of the iconic White House, and see it getting damaged on a scale and level yet to be seen before (Independence Day's single, thick laser beam obliteration is no count). In fact, the White House itself is a character with its nooks and crannies, real or otherwise, put into the film to become that edged advantage for our hero, and the President's young son Connor (Finley Jacobsen). Music by Trevor Morris keeps the tempo urgent, but relies probably on the same consistent bars for the main theme to be running almost forever.Perhaps what made Olympus Has Fallen a little bit more fun, is its star studded cast. Gerard Butler proves once again he's action hero material, although too cool and hardly breaking into a sweat as he takes his orders and executes them with brutal efficiency, that you'd stop caring after a while since he's perpetually indestructible. Aaron Eckhart graduates from District Attorney to bland US President whose job is actually to give that rousing speech at the end, while Morgan Freeman strolls his way through yet another Presidency role, albeit an acting one here, since his Deep Impact days. Dylan McDermott and Angela Bassett were grossly underused as a mercenary bodyguard and Secret Service Director respectively, with the latter being nothing more than Ms Stating-the-Obvious, while Melissa Leo had a bit role as the needlessly gutsy Secretary of Defense. Rick Yune as the villain was as bland as Butler was the hero, and like all action films, the story's usually as good as how evil the antagonist is, which fell a little bit short on both counts.It does seem that 2013 is the year for White House being under attack in the cinemas, with another film lined up with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx headlining the Roland Emmerich film. So while waiting for that to arrive, it's still quite the action-adventure fun witnessing Gerard Butler complete his no-nonsense tour of duty with the Secret Service, before Tatum arrives reporting for active duty, and hopefully emerges as the stronger film between the two, since this one didn't set the bar too high.",Olympus Has Fallen
24,siderite,Humourless and rather offensive clone of Die Hard,5,30 October 2013,"The plot of this movie is pretty much that of Die Hard, only blown completely out of proportion, badly made, and, again, making the North Korean be the evil threat to ""our freedom and way of life"". There is even applause at the end.Romantic lead turned muscle man Gerald Butler is the hero, while Rick Yune is the villain. And if you think Yune is being, again, miscast as a cardboard villain when he clearly can do more, just look at all those people who are getting paid for a few scenes or for acting in ridiculous scenes: Aaron Eckhart, Dylan McDermott, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser. Even Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett are there only to support Butler, with unspeakably weak and empty characters.This time there is no doubt in my mind when I rate this film as an offensive failure. Trying to make a movie and failing at it is one thing, but knowing that you are doing a crap film in which you pay a lot of money to known actors just so you can trap viewers and get more money out of it should be criminal.And what hurts more is that I really like Butler, even as an action hero, and he did a good job in the film. If only the script wasn't such an incredible pile of redigested excrement.Bottom line: avoid this poisonous, condescending, money grabbing, badly made - from lame lines to bad special effects (they couldn't even get the FX right!), pathetic excuse for a film.",Olympus Has Fallen

26,StevePulaski,"""You can't do that; this is America!""",5,24 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen doesn't come bearing the same sort of blatant, narcissistic patriotism a film like Red Dawn or its 2012 remake, yet it doesn't equip itself with much more brain either. I suppose if you've been victim to lukewarm action movie efforts this year like Bullet to the Head, The Last Stand, and Parker, you may enjoy and embrace this one for its true seriousness and its captivating premise. If you're hoping for something a bit more ideal and one that caters to a movie-going mass much larger than its own demographic, you will be sorely disappointed.I bet I could get by with simply saying that in this film, the White House falls victim to an unexpected attack from a Korean terrorist group and it's up to a Secret Service agent and a whole gang of suits to save the president and the country. After all, isn't that what you, the potential audience member wants? Just a broad overview of the storyline, and an answer to the question, 'how much action is there?' Who cares about characters, suspense, and detail, when we have enough explosions to house an entire franchise? To go a little bit deeper, just to waste a bit more time, Aaron Eckhart is President Benjamin Asher, who is in office when the White House gets violently attacked, Gerard Butler is Mike Banning, a former Army Ranger now serving as a Secret Service agent, and Morgan Freeman is Allan Trumbull, the Speaker of the House who becomes the acting president when Asher is taken as a hostage in the bunker of the house by the terrorist group. Upon seizing entire control of the White House, the terrorist group spends the remainder of the film in negotiation with the acting members of the U.S. government, all lead by Trumbull, as they try to beat the top-secret codes for the nuclear reactors in the U.S. They desperately want the codes to trigger the bombs to explode in their silos, effectively wiping out most, or all, of the population due to radiation poisoning.My main problem with the film is not only is the entire premise redundant and mostly uninteresting, it's that none of the characters are likable or even able to spawn some type of reaction. We already are told how gutless of a President Asher is, so he's a little hard to feel for in the mix of all this, Banning often spends his time scurrying through the White House, shooting all the invaders, dodging all gunfire while his co-workers aren't so lucky, definitely making him a faceless character. The saving grace, one would hope, would be Freeman's Allan, only his character is just as dull and as muted as the other two, rendering his entire performance as a cute novelty.The action scenes are likely to drum a positive reaction from the audience, if that's what they came for (and I'm willing to bet most of them did indeed), but the been-there-done-that format in which they are conducted in really wears on the viewer who wants the luxury of seeing something more. For a film that appears to be the ultimate American terrorist film, I got more jollies off the invasion sequence in the new Red Dawn and I still see that as a less accomplished film than this. The invasion scene here performs exactly how you'd expect; quickly and in a way that lacks sufficient suspense or mystery. We know a lot of people will die and we pretty much know exactly who will live.Olympus Has Fallen benefits from a few moderately suspenseful instances, regardless of how perfunctory they may seem (take the subplot involving President Asher's kid), and does boast a solid set of special effects to go along with it. However, these things sort of get lost in the sea of mediocrity and formula this film wallows in for much of its overlong runtime. On a sidenote, this is where I show my roots different from others my age. Some will tell me, upon giving a film they find superior and worthy of recognition a bad review, that I clearly overanalyze things and need to view things from an entertainment perspective. I always do. I always write reviews based on my personal thoughts, and what I find entertaining and not. For those who ask me if Olympus Has Fallen is worth seeing, or for that matter, entertaining, I will politely tell them ""not really,"" explain why, then steer them towards something more substantial like Spring Breakers. In this way, both parties are benefited equally.My video review of Olympus Has Fallen, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z-7nv2uvv8Starring: Aaron Eckhart, Gerard Butler, and Morgan Freeman.

27,KineticSeoul,"What ""Die Hard 5"" should have been...",7,13 April 2013,"Well Gerard Butler is back to his roots on what he does best. Instead of constantly doing romantic comedies, which some are watchable. But he is just better with these types or roles. The actions and character interactions are quite predictable and generic but the direction it goes makes this a entertaining popcorn flick. Especially since the people in the White House or has anything to do with the White House are all just darn charismatic. It has Aaron Eckhart as the president of the United states and he is a tough and charismatic president. If I think of a modern day American president, Aaron Eckhart just pops in my head or at least someone that looks similar to him. And it even has Morgan Freeman as the speaker of the house...Nuff said. And Rick Yune who is basically a North Korean terrorist actually somewhat stands out as the main villain. Well at least way more than Will Yun Lee from the crappy ""Red Dawn"" reboot. The plot is basically about the North Korean terrorists taking over the White House and only one man is capable or at least put in the situation to fight back. And although some parts just gets really dumb, it's still entertaining to a degree. When it comes to action movies this is generic as it gets for the most part. But it's just very entertaining to watch Gerard Butler as the secret service guy kicking ass and taking names. Overall this is a very watchable popcorn flick. And is a good throwback to the 90's action movies even if some of the one-liners can get really really cheesy.7/10",Olympus Has Fallen
28,sddavis63,It's Enjoyable If You Can Suspend Your Disbelief,7,22 December 2013,"If you don't expect too much from this, it's really quite an exciting movie. I'm not a huge fan of Gerard Butler, but overall I thought he worked pretty well as Secret Service agent Mike Banning. Banning once headed the team in charge of the president's security, but left after an accident that killed the First Lady. Assigned to routine duty at the Treasury Department, Banning ends up being the last hope to avoid a nuclear catastrophe after the president is kidnapped and held hostage inside the White House bunker by North Korean terrorists.It's imperative that you suspend disbelief in order to watch this. The sheer numbers involved in the terrorist plot make it hard to believe that the plot went undetected, and I was shaking my head at the suggestion that the huge military plane being flown by two North Korean pilots could get so close to the White House before it raised any alarms. Surely someone somewhere would have noticed such a large and unidentified plane and raised an alarm. But no one did. But set all the unbelievable elements aside. This IS in fact exciting, and Butler is actually pretty good as the lead. Morgan Freeman was also pretty good as the Speaker of the House who becomes acting president after the president and vice president are both taken hostage. I would say,though, that I found Aaron Eckhardt underwhelming as the president. But this is a good, if unbelievable, ride. (7/10)",Olympus Has Fallen
29,Hellmant,The most preposterous and ridiculous 'DIE HARD' redo yet but it is entertaining.,7,25 March 2013,"'OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) It's been a long time since we've had a good 'DIE HARD' rip-off! We used to get them all the time; 'DIE HARD on a bus' ('SPEED'), 'DIE HARD on a plane' ('PASSENGER 57'), 'DIE HARD on a boat' ('UNDER SIEGE'), 'DIE HARD on a train ('UNDER SIEGE 2'), 'DIE HARD at a hockey rink' ('SUDDEN DEATH') and many more. 'DIE HARD at the White House' was inevitable and it's the most preposterous and ridiculous 'DIE HARD' redo yet. It is entertaining though. Surprisingly it's the first of two movies dealing with the same subject matter this year. The Roland Emmerich helmed 'WHITE HOUSE DOWN' comes out in June in which Channing Tatum plays a cop touring the White House who must protect the president (Jamie Foxx) from terrorists there. I hope that's even better but this one definitely doesn't disappoint.This White House invasion film revolves around a Presidential guard named Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) who's let go from his White House position after he fails to save the president's wife (Ashley Judd) in an automobile accident. President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) doesn't want to be reminded of the tragedy so he has Banning removed from his security unit. When North Korean terrorists take over the White House, and take the president hostage, Banning makes his way into the building without being noticed. He then takes on the terrorists one at a time as he communicates with the acting president, Speaker Trumbull (Freeman), and the Secret Service Director (Angela Bassett) outside. Dylan McDermott, Rick Yune, Melissa Leo, Radha Mitchell and Cole Houser also co-star in the film.The movie was directed by Antoine Fuqua (of 'TRAINING DAY' fame) and written by first time film writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. As unbelievable as it is it's still somewhat suspenseful and the action is decent. Butler makes a good action hero and it's amazing how much he resembles Mel Gibson in his day. Fuqua definitely knows how to direct an action film like this, the impressive cast is a little underused but they do add some credibility to the laughable premise. Not nearly as cool or entertaining as a 'DIE HARD' film but it is a decent redo. If you're a fan of 'DIE HARD' rip-offs than you're almost sure to enjoy.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75ldnaJSPKw",Olympus Has Fallen
30,Buddy-51,Ultra-violent action movie with too many tedious stretches,5,17 November 2013,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" offers a veritable orgy of death and destruction, as a massive gang of amazingly coordinated North Korean terrorists lay siege to the White House and take the President (Aaron Eckhart) and many of his staff and cabinet members hostage.Gerard Butler plays a Secret Service agent who's been sidelined since a tragedy befell the President's family 18 months earlier while they were under his care. Turns out that single-handedly rescuing the President from a bunch of crazed, bloodthirsty terrorists may just be the opportunity he's been looking for both to get back in the Commander-in-Chief's good graces and to prove to himself that he still has what it takes to be a good agent (so what if half of Washington D.C. needs to be sacrificed to make the point? It's all just collateral damage anyway, right?). Morgan Freeman steps into the breach in his customary reassuring-presence-in-a-time-of-crisis role, this time as the Speaker of the House who assumes the position of president while the Prez and Vice Prez are otherwise occupied. But Dylan McDermott, as a traitorous Secret Service agent, seems to be stuck in a bit of a career rut of late, what with this role and his current portrayal of yet another kidnapper-bent-on-killing-the-president in the TV series ""Hostages."" Director Antoine Fuqua certainly knows how to crank up the energy, but even the most die-hard action film fan may have some trouble stomaching the astonishingly high body count in this one. At the very least, you might find yourself reaching for some earplugs long about the half hour mark just to find some respite from all the noise.The initial invasion scenes are admittedly very exciting, but the static hostage drama - with its tough guy bravado and seemingly endless cat-and-mouse tour of the White House - that ensues eventually becomes wearying.If you like movies in which the fate of the world rests in the hands of a single man getting to the launch codes in time - served with a heaping helping of good old-fashioned American jingoism on the side - then ""Olympus Has Fallen"" may be just the meal you ordered.

31,thesar-2,Die Hard 5.24,6,13 July 2013,"I think I've gotten too soft lately. After liking/appreciating The Expendables 2, The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head, I enjoyed Olympus Has Fallen. It's a popcorn movie with huge plot holes and still managed to entertain me.Being a fan of both the Die Hard films (ONLY 1, 3, 4 and partially 2) and Jack Bauer from the television series: 24, helped tremendously. For, this absolutely should've been A Good Day to Die Hard. It had every element of that series, from the action, acting, plot twists, characters and snappy dialogue. Perhaps they didn't re-write this to include John McClane because he was never secret service (or didn't want to be) or the fact they just did #4 in D.C. But, nevertheless, this was a movie to be enjoyed by Die Hard fans.In addition, I saw a lot of 24's Jack Bauer in Gerard Butler's ""Mike."" So, to me, despite the clichéd and predictable Olympus Has Fallen, I had a great time.After attempting to save the President, but inadvertently losing the First Lady, Mike Banning (Butler) gets banned from the Secret Service. 18 months later, he fights his way, literally, back into the White House when rogue North Koreans are bent on world control. Hell breaks loose and only Mike on the inside can save the day.Okay, there's many problems here, some harder to get past. Such a Korean plane crossing thousands of miles only to be detected in the states and then, only intercepted by two US military jets. Then, after 18 months of absence, Mike is able to access all coded secrets in the White House that apparently haven't been re-coded. And then, there are safety protocols in place, but can be easily accessed in one single room with all the right people.The movie isn't to be taken seriously at all. You do need to leave your brain at the door. But, if you channel both Jack Bauer and John McClane within yourself, you, too, can have a good time.May the Fallen rise again until the remake, White House Down, comes out later in the same year.",Olympus Has Fallen

33,Robert_duder,"The action genre just may rise again. Gritty, visceral and entertaining!",8,25 March 2013,"When I saw the first trailers for Olympus Has Fallen...I was thrilled. I thought it looked exactly like the kind of good old fashion R-Rated Action flick that used to get made or the ones that have simply faltered lately. I felt like if this was the kind of action flick that I love that it too would fail at the box office. I was relieved and excited to see that the film opened very well and furthermore was even getting some great reviews. So when I saw the film for myself I was thrilled that the movie was EXACTLY what I anticipated. Its a throwback to Die Hard, AirForce One, and just great gritty, violent, R-Rated action flicks of 80's and 90's. The film actually reeks of Die Hard (and I don't mean that to be a negative thing at all.) Olympus Has Fallen felt more Die Hard than A Good Day To Die Hard did...minus Bruce Willis. The action is visceral and dark. You will feel nauseous and emotional watching that initial invasion scene as they mercilessly murder innocent people on the streets. There is just something powerful and gritty about it. Some of the hand to hand combat scenes were a little dark which was unfortunate but for the most part the fight scenes were brilliantly done.Gerard Butler has had a distinctive up and down career. 2012 was a bit of a slump for him but he also tends to try his hand in so many different genres. Whether he likes it or not, action might just be his niche. He does a truly outstanding job taking the lead as Secret Service agent Mike Banning. The character could be described as your stereotypical action hero in this type of film and that would be true. However, Butler pulls it off in true form. Aaron Eckhart is perfectly Presidential as the President. Not only does he look like a hero and have great charisma but he truly looks like a towering beacon of American politics. I wanted to see him jump into the action a little more but it wasn't about him doing that. He was excellent and him and Butler have great chemistry. Dylan McDermott was just terrific in his role. It was a smaller part but so vital and just really well done. He was perfectly cast. Morgan Freeman does what Morgan Freeman does best. If you like him then you love his characters. Once again he ends up playing the acting President of The United States and he always ups the class of any cast. Melissa Leo is also very good in a small role as Secretary of Defense. Unfortunately for her she got one of the cheesier moments in the film but she handles it well and plays a character with a lot of spirit and courage. And to the character that I think literally makes or breaks an action like this...the villain, the big bad, the leader...in this case he is played by Rick Yune. I was sceptical to see the main villain being played by an unknown but I eat my scepticism because he was excellent. He commanded the screen and was appropriately evil at every turn. I don't think he and Butler had perfect chemistry as foes but it was good enough. Supporting cast deserve mention too including stand out performances from Finley Jacobsen, Angela Bassett, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser.Perhaps the beauty and also the drawback to the movie is that it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. Some will cry foul and say that its predictable and rehashed material and in some aspects they would be right. But when you're making a genre specific film and trying to appeal to those fans then you need to use the familiar ingredients. I didn't know who directed the film while watching it but I kept imagining scenarios of what this would have been like in the hands of McG or Michael Bay or Tony Scott...any number of directors could have done something different with it. Antoine Fuqua comes from Music Videos which usually spells bad news but he has made a name for himself in directing. I have seen a few of his films and enjoyed them. I believe he is an action film fan at heart and he happens to know what the audience wants to see. Olympus Has Fallen wasn't quite brilliant. With any action flick that follows the path there are certain issues with that as well. Inevitable plot holes that simply have to be overlooked (Why did no one even attempt to save the First Lady or check on her well being? Why did the Secret Service rush out the front doors of The White House for five minutes while a Helicopter mowed them down, after the first wave they probably would have stopped rushing?) And so on and so forth. But as a HUGE old school action fan myself I know how to conveniently ignore reality and just enjoy it. One man, with a special set of skills, left alone to defend the world/White House...it was everything I wanted it to be. Go in with the proper expectations and you'll have a solid two hours (it flies by!) of old fashion, popcorn eatin', red blooded entertainment. And once again (I've said this before in my reviews) I'm Canadian and Canadians who see movies like this always make fun of and bully the patriotism in the film. (Oh 'Muricans got their propaganda eh?) Well I would like to say again that I wish our country and other countries had even a tenth of the patriotism and traditions that most of America has. Enough said...now go watch Gerard Butler kick some serious butt.",Olympus Has Fallen
34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A glossed up straight to DVD film designed to appeal to the masses,4,28 April 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningMike Banning (Gerard Butler) was President Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) favourite Secret Service Agent, until a tragic accident lead him to make a tough decision where the president's wife was killed. Some time later, the president is braced for a meeting with the Prime Minister of South Korea, to discuss what can be done to help protect them from the north. All is going swimmingly, until some insurgents launch a terrorist attack where the White House is attacked and then taken over by Kang (Rick Yune) and his army. Banning finds himself the only man able to bring the terrorists down.With the precarious political climate at the moment, with world wide tensions on high alert over North Korea's nuclear capabilities, Antoine Fuqua's high octane action flick at the very least carries an air of daring controversy about it that could mark it downright inappropriate to some. And, of course, no one's forgotten about 9/11, so conceivable terrorist outrages that would have seemed fantastical years ago now seem like what could be a terrifying, very real reality (what if the White House got taken over?) But that's as far as the food for thought goes with this generic, utterly by the numbers glossed up straight to DVD film, a predictable, formulaic, maybe even slightly dated ride all the way.The film manages the incredible feat of taking an A list cast and managing to bring out the most wooden performances in all of them (Eckhart's 'noooo' shriek after his wife's death really stands out.) Lead stars Butler and Eckhart give off the impression they've made their mark as established stars and can now get away with giving 'phone in' performances, of which there may be more to come. And so, we have Butler doing his impression of Bruce Willis, grunting along, giving Brucie no competition in the wise cracking one liners department (""Me and you are gonna have a game of f**k off. You go first."" ???) while Eckhart tries but fails to bring off his Dark Knight righteousness. A support cast including Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett are simply thankless pieces of the furniture. Yune is probably the star of the show as the villain, but it can't be said he makes the film.The initial White House assault provides some pretty decent, exciting action, but in a film with no sense of tension or excitement, it has no real merit. Fuqua never managed to repeat his Training Day master stroke, and OHF fails to change this, a none stop sprouting of clichés all the way that at best comes off as tiresome, at worst laughable. **",Olympus Has Fallen
35,MOscarbradley,Extremely violent and hardly original.,3,20 December 2019,"Hollywood being Hollywood, it didn't take them long to cash in on 9/11 with this terrorist attack movie in which a host of Asian terrorists, (very North Korean), slaughter half of Washington D.C. and take over the White House, holding the President hostage. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is extremely violent, at times appallingly so, and suffers in being much too similar to ""White House Down"" which came out at the same time. It may be technically proficient but is also in very bad taste.A good supporting cast, (Aaron Eckhart as the President, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster as various officals), suffer stoically while Gerard Butler saves the world. As the bad guys, Dylan McDermott and especially Rick Yune have the best of it and are obviously relishing their roles.

36,bowmanblue,Solid action blockbuster,7,12 June 2014,"The phrase most banded around when people are talking about the latest Gerard Butler action movie is 'Die Hard in the White House.' And, I think that's a fair comment.Die Hard was a classic action movie. It was even superior to its sequels, mainly because it was set in a single - very claustrophobic - location (whereas the others had John McClane travelling all over the place). Olympus Has Fallen is modelled after the first Die Hard. Instead of a plaza, the terrorists have taken over the White House and it's up to security agent Gerard Butler to use his inside knowledge of the building to pick the bad guys off one by one.There's nothing massively original in the story, but it's possibly the first action movie that's come close to Die Hard. It has plenty of action and big budget special effects. Okay, so Gerard Butler doesn't have to do much other than look tough and fire guns, but it's an action movie, so are you really expecting much else? If you're looking for a good action movie and not much more, then you'll get what you came for here.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Olympus Has Fallen
37,dromasca,not a high mountain,4,31 December 2013,"Gods do not seem to aim too high nowadays, not in the cinema industry anyway. Olympus Has Fallen is one of the relatively successful action movies of 2013. Audiences did not rush in masses but did not avoid it either, critics were not enthusiastic but did not 'destroy' it, and it paid back the production costs even before the release of the DVDs and TV runs. So its a good study case about what I do not like in Hollywood action movies :-) So, the (American) nation is again under attack in 'Olympus ...'. North Korean are the hard-to-dispute nowadays bad guys, and we know how bad they are from the news, and this film will not tell us more about why they are bad than the news. This time they take the White House which seems to have achieved in the last few years the status of one of the most blown-up buildings in the world (in movies). In the semi-ruins of the White House a semi-renegaded secret agent fights empty-handed to bring back the Universe in balance. He will succeed. The only surprising thing is that his name is not Jack Bauer.Morgan Freeman seems quite embarrassed to be involved with this film, as the acting President at times of trouble. The rest of the acting stuff (including Gerald Butler and Aaron Eckhart) does the decent job they are paid for, but cannot go much higher or deeper than TV series acting. The dialog does not help them too much, and I especially disliked the naturalistic reaction that the leaders of the nation are shown to take when facing physical danger. Cursing is not the best manner of showing dignity in my opinion. Director Anoine Fuqua is actually doing well his job of bringing action to screen, but with the script at hand he cannot make of 'Olympus ...' more than a rough action movie in which the events happen to take place in the White House.",Olympus Has Fallen
38,ThomasDrufke,Opened the Gates of Hell,7,14 February 2016,"Realistically, Olympus Has Fallen is not a good film. Its overabundance of bad CGI, cheesy one-liners, and a weak script overall are just some of the few problems with this film. But I don't think I can deny that I had plenty of fun watching Gerard Butler go around the White House acting like John McClane. That's basically what I looked at it like, Die Hard at the White House. If you go into it without expecting much, I think you'll believe its a good time at the movies.Antoine Fuqua really knows how to strike the right chord with action films. Whether its Training Day, The Equalizer, or even last years' Southpaw, the man knows how to make a crowd pleaser. For the most part, I think Olympus Has Fallen is yet another one to add to his resume. Butler is great as the ex-presidential guard who is now the only one with the capability to save the President left, and he's surrounded with an all around great cast. Rick Yune also gives a refreshing performance for a villain who would have otherwise felt clichéd and uninspired. I'm not willing to say this film would be worth buying on blu-ray or require a second viewing, but it's definitely a guilty movie pleasure.At times the score can be bombastic, the script can come off very one-note, and maybe even too reliant on bloody action, but it's nonetheless entertaining as hell. The hand to hand combat breaks the shaky cam mold made by Hollywood of late. Besides, I'm just glad we got an Aaron Eckhart sighting, seriously, where has he been? If you don't go into it expecting much, I think Olympus Has Fallen can be a fun time, even if it's essentially a Die Hard rip off.+Great action+Butler is meant to play these roles+Cast+Fuqua's directing-Some obvious CGI moments-Cheesy one-liner moments7.2/10",Olympus Has Fallen
39,g-bodyl,Action-Packed Movie!,9,22 July 2014,"Olympus Has Fallen has been compared to Die Hard and has aptly been given the name, ""Die Hard at the White House."" Be that as it may, this film is a little unique. There are some clichés here or there, but director Antoine Fuqua brought his own fresh take to this film and delivers a product that is action-packed, thrilling, fun, violent, and even a little patriotic. I say after I watched the film, I grown even closer to my country.Fuqua's film is about a former Secret Service agent named Mike Banning who has fallen from grace after a terrible accident. Now stuck at a desk job, he is offered a chance to be a hero once the White House has fallen under attack from the North Koreans and the President held hostage.This film is definitely well-acted. Gerald Butler delivers his finest live-action performance in years as Banning. He is like the anti-John McClane. In other words, no sardonic quips from him as he takes his job and kicking butt very seriously. Aaron Eckhart makes a fine President, especially when taken hostage. Morgan Freeman is a delight to watch in any film and that is no exception here. Though Melissa Leo does not have much screen time, her role as Secretary of Defense is great as she plays tough while captive.Overall, Olympus Has Fallen is a very entertaining film that reminds me of 80's action films and such films like Die Hard and Air Force One. But this film is unique in its own way. I like how Fuqua stays away from using Middle Eastern people as the terrorists, because they have been played to death. It is time to give North Korea the chance. If you like action, blood, and somebody who tries to save the day, then this is the film for you. I rate this film 9/10.",Olympus Has Fallen

41,secondtake,"Action, blood, and bland patriotism in a formula computer graphics package, no ribbon",4,6 August 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen (2013)A bloody, ruthless, formulaic but scary depiction of an overtaking of the White House by some North Korean extremists. Even the stars (Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart, the Harvey Dent character from ""Dark Knight"") are reprising earlier kinds of roles. There is the military hubris, the failsafe nuclear dilemma, the swooping helicopters. And all the special effects, much of which is of course very good, though part of it look like video game graphics.The most unique aspect here is the Korean contingent--an impossibly large, coordinated, well equipped, and ruthless cadre. In case anyone worries this kind of takeover might be possible, the sheer number of people involved, and the need for insider information and a mole inside the White House, make it really unlikely. There's also the problem movies like this have where one side can shoot and the other side can't. In this case, in the first half, the White House guards leap into the oncoming bullets with their handguns one after another.The point is bloodshed. Truly, the point of the movie, the thing that will make it succeed, is the high energy mayhem and high body count. In fact, the whole episode really is like a new video game--recovering the white house back from evil hostage takers.I wish the plot had some redeeming aspects to write about. There is the son of the President and his rescue, a kind of feel-good subplot that shows the secret tunnels inside the building (which may or may not exist). The truly awful Korean gang is led by a guy who is cool about executing people, and bloodless about torturing cabinet secretaries. If you take it at all seriously, the situation is gutwrenching and sadistic. And I mean the movie makers are sadistic, not just the character.I know there are people who will like this without reservations, even if it isn't wholly original. And it does have a tension as the third leading character played by Gerard Butler goes in like a Bruce Willis, single-handedly winning the day, step by impossible step. But without humor (he tries once or twice), and without the grander effects of the more innocent ""Die Hard"" series. Freeman, as much as he's solid, is not in this much. It's mostly Butler's movie, and he's convincing as a character in an often unconvincing movie.",Olympus Has Fallen

And a knife.I especially liked the way, while both movies used the trope of the ""innocent"" child potentially to be used as a hostage, Olympus actually got the kid out safely early on so we could narrow down the scope of the dramatic conflict to just the good guy and the bad guy.Holds up well on second viewing.

44,callanvass,"Old school, retro action! It restored my faith in the action genre",8,26 August 2013,"I have been rather bummed out as of late when it comes to action movies. Aside from The Expendables franchise which I admittedly relish, and a few others here and there. I've been very disappointed when it comes to action movies. I saw the trailer for this when it was first released in theaters, and I didn't think it was all that. It looked like a generic action film; however. I started reading a lot of praise for this film, so I was rather pumped for the DVD release. I can honestly say I haven't had this much fun with an action film in a while. This looks and feels like an 80's action film. It's no holds barred with everything it does, and the action is non stop throughout the film. White House Down is an eerily similar action film with Channing Tatum. I have yet to see it, but I highly doubt it manages to reach Olympus Has Fallen levels of entertainment. Helicopters get blown to pieces, and bodies get tossed around; hell. Even the White House isn't safe from a thrashing. The story is nothing special. It's quite derivative, we've seen it before. Die Hard rings a bell, but many action films since have borrowed from Die Hard. I honestly didn't care. I was too busy receiving my insane adrenaline rush that I got from this movie. The violence is rather brutal and I loved every minute of it. How can you not get thrills with Gerald Butler going to town on everybody? The man has charisma to spare, and he's returned to the genre where I first started liking him. I'm a big Butler fan regardless, but the action genre is where he belongs. Good stuff, bud! Rick Yune is no stranger to playing the bad guy. He rocked in Die Another Day, and he rocked again here. I thought he was great. Aaron Eckhart makes for a very effective and sympathetic president. Morgan Freeman adds a touch of class to every role he is in, and here was no different. Names like Melissa Leo, Angela Bassett, and Dylan McDermott are great as well.Final Thoughts: Thank you Olympus Has Fallen for giving me that adrenaline rush I had sorely missed when it comes to pure action. Turn your brain switch off, sit back and soak it all in. What follows should be a memorable two hours of non-stop action that I am almost certain you'll love.

47,tabuno,Die Hard Grown Up,8,17 January 2019,"12 April 2013. Except for some special effects problems and a major plot point weakness by Morgan Freeman's character, this action thriller exceeds its predecessors in much the same way that Casino Royale (2006) updated the James Bond series. Instead of Bruce Willis's somewhat pedestrian everyman entertainment version of action thriller of the classic Die Hard (1988) and to a lesser extent Steven Segal's Asian humbled version of an action thriller of Under Siege (1992), Olympus Has Fallen is more serious and deliberate, especially in its set up. There's a later scene which takes from Under Siege in its deployment of special ops writ large.The film suffers from the lack of consistency high tech special effects where some scenes look faked and Morgan Freeman's later executive decisions are somewhat questionable considering how serious and focused on authentic protocol tone of the overall movie. However, such weaknesses only slightly tarnish was is a well executed character development and edited opening sequences all the way through the initial Olympus has fallen scene. The script and Gerard Butler's character is also offered commendable platform where instead of Willis's or Segal's over the top action performances, Butler's execution is much more toned down and realistic and refrains from over the top dramatization which lends even more respect to the Office of the Presidency in this movie.It's hard to watch this movie without considering the current North Korean threats of nuclear war and the insidious and cold-harded Asians cutting down a symbol of American power and prestige. Melissa Leo's performance as Secretary of Defense is on of the most gripping of any scene in the movie. The politically charged musical orchestration is also powerful, reminiscent Dance with Wolves (1990) or Gettysburg (1993).Overall this action thriller sets a new standard for substantive and focused action that doesn't abuse its stunt work or special effects or or obvious stereotypes.

49,The-Sarkologist,Die Hard in the White House,6,21 December 2013,"Isn't it funny that Hollywood seems to have this habit of releasing two films with the same themes at the same time. Okay, that doesn't always happen, but with regards to Olympus Has Fallen and Whitehouse Down, they have done just that. To sum this movie up in one sentence and that is that it is 'Die Hard in the White House'. Look, there is not necessarily a problem with that, particularly since the Die Hard formula generally works really well, but in the end it is the original movie that is still the best, and everything else is just weak copies.Basically a group of North Korean terrorists, through a very intricate plan, manage to capture the White House and proceed to activate all of the United State's nuclear arsenal so that they, well, basically blow up the United States so that the Americans learn something about famine and suffering. I somehow find it a little unconvincing to think that the Norh Koreans would actually be able to do something like that (though this is more believable than the remake of Red Dawn). However, as I was watching this film I was wondering whether the North Koreans were actually a proxy for another superpower. In a way though, it seems that the Americans are struggling to actually find a convincing enemy for their movies ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union (and to be honest, they were actually quite scary, unlike the North Koreans or Islamic extremists).This, however, it still quite a fun movie, if you like a decent dose of explosions, machine guns, and a C90 circling the White House firing off a pair of mini-guns while doing so. I guess if you also like the ex-special forces secret service agent who has slipped into the White House undetected, and is going around systematically killing off the terrorists and then saving the day. Then there is also this incredibly patriotic speech at the end of the movie that, if this were to happen in real life, would result in the further removal of citizen's rights, increased security, and a sudden shift further to the political right (as what happened after September 11th).Still no Die Hard clone can ever beat 'Ho, ho, ho, now I have a machine gun'.",Olympus Has Fallen

They're almost identical. Of the two, I prefer 'Olympus Has Fallen' due to better acting and lack of comic relief, but 'White House Down' is more toned down on the brutality. So, I guess - if you don't like it too graphic - rather watch 'White House Down'. 'Olympus Has Fallen' is a much more serious film.The film is often compared to 'Die Hard'. Honestly, I don't agree. Just like films set in the woods are bound to be compared to 'Blair Witch Project' and shark movies to 'Jaws', action hostage thrillers will be compared to 'Die Hard'. Not fair.Gerard Butler certainly gives it his all in this film. He is superb! The film features stellar performances from a seasoned cast. I enjoyed Aaron Eckhart as the President (much more than Jamie Foxx in 'White House Down', who was probably the worst onscreen President yet).The action sequences are fast, brutal and incredibly realistic.

51,sol-,Fall Hard,5,14 August 2016,"Marketed as ""Die Hard in the White House"", the plot of this action thriller has a lone Secret Service agent taking on North Korean terrorists who have invaded the White House (codename Olympus), holding the President hostage. The film features several gripping action scenes and some of the smaller moments (a bullet-ridden US flag) are very effective, however, the project would have benefited from all the 'Die Hard' parallels being far less pronounced. As it is, Gerard Butler sorely lacks the charisma Bruce Willis brought to the iconic 1988 film, there is significantly less comic relief, and try as Rick Yune does with the part, he is no Hans Gruber. Issues of credibility weigh heavily more against 'Olympus Has Fallen' too; whereas Willis only had to take on board a handful of terrorists in 'Die Hard', here Butler comes off almost without scratch after intense encounters with three or four times as many antagonists! To the film's credit, it does at least attempt to throw some character study in the midst with Butler haunted by an earlier incident in which he was able to save the President, but not his wife, in a road accident. Butler's rapport with the President's son feels very real too. Then again, the film never maximises the potential of Butler and the son knowing all the ins and outs and secret passageways of the White House. Butler's big advantage here is his training rather than his insider knowledge, which in turns renders the film far less interesting than it could have been even if there is a nary a boring moment in the action-packed ride.",Olympus Has Fallen

There were some plot twists which I didn't expect and that made the movie even more interesting. I liked the direction which was made by Antoine Fuqua and I believe he did a very good job at it. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that I didn't expect such a good performance by Aaron Eckhart who played as President Benjamin Asher. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Gerard Butler's who played as Mike Banning the former presidential guard and he was simply amazing and Finley Jacobsen's who played as Connor the son of President Benjamin Asher.Finally, I have to say that ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is an average good movie to watch and if you are a fan of action movies then I am sure that you are going to enjoy watching it.

53,Floated2,Predictable Action Film Running on Fumes,3,27 January 2015,"Olympus Has Fallen has came out similar distances among other action films in 2013. A rushed production schedule, designed to get the film into cinemas before its bigger-budget rival, could be blamed for some of the problems. The visual effects are frequently scruffy-looking, particularly during the many moments of skybound carnage. The action, while starting strongly with an intense extended assault on the White House lawn, degenerates into dimly lit grappling in Presidential corridors. The real issues lie in the screenplay, from first-timers Katrin Benedikt and Creighton Rothenberger, which grinds from one hokey beat to the next.Not only is Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) a Xerox of the haunted hero from In The Line Of Fire, you'll get 24 flashbacks when he starts barking questions at vanquished foes (and with Butler's accent occasionally slipping into his native brogue, it really is a case of Jock Bauer). Besides a subplot involving his friendship with the tiresome First Child, and an odd running theme involving him knifing people in the head, the actor barely gets anything to do. Although he at least has a few memorable zingers, which is more than you can say for Morgan Freeman (whose big moment as the acting Prez is a speech about how he likes his coffee), Aaron Eckhart (who spends the run-time tied up). Other characters are so lazily drawn that they're introduced with subtitles explaining who they are.

Having only seen Olympus it is impossible to say which one wins out but one has the feeling they almost equal each other for pure unbridled sense of action and seriously questionable scripts.Gerard Butler here gives one of his more lazy performances as ex-presidential bodyguard Mike and it must be said he just really isn't someone we ever root, a problem we never had when it came to John McLane or other such classic action heroes. Other casts members also don't really register much including Eckhart as President Asher and a mind boggling lazy role from Morgan Freeman as the speaker of the house Trumball. That's really the big problem with Olympus, the action is somewhat bearable but anytime the guns aren't blasting (and blood squibs bursting!) it really isn't tolerable at all.Olympus is a better action movie than quite a few others released in recent memory but that is not exactly a glowing endorsement considering the crop that has been offered up to audiences.

No Big surprise there, but definitely something ""new"" in this Disinformation Age. In OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, the U.$. is under siege by- you guessed it- some North Koreans. Unlike the ""mentally unstable"" woman recently blown away on the Capitol Grounds, these terrorists find themselves up against Gerard Butler (who I always get confused with Russel Crow), doing his version of Bruce Willis in DIE HARD. (Where's Jason Statham when we need him? Sure, his action movies are every bit as interchangeable as any Jean-Claude van Damm or Steven Seagal or Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone or Chuck Norris or Arnold Schwarzenegger or Wesley Snipes movie, but at least Statham has a sense of humor, a bit of acting ability, and knows how to execute some pretty cool martial arts techniques.) Like THE HURT LOCKER, OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN gives us a glimpse into the good ol' Killer Cowboy mentality that permeates the Media at large; in fact, the movie's often indistinguishable from a First-person Shooter video game. Olympus, as some of you may know, was the home of the gods. One of the formidable monsters from that Greek mythology was the Hydra, a creature that grew two new heads for every one that got lopped off; like the Hydra, The Blight House is prepared for the CGI assault the filmmakers unleash upon it and Morgan Freeman, his GLORY days behind him now, unleashes the CGI dogs of war (Cerebrus being another mythological monster, a three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades). Director Fuqua doesn't seem to know what the fuqua he's doing here: if the Bad Guys really wanted to disrupt the steady flow of oil that powers the Oilygarchy, they should've just paid the Republicans to shut it all down again. Or invest in drones. (Or maybe even hire somebody to disable all of The Blight House computers. Too far-fetched? On THE David PAKMAN SHOW, it's been revealed that Right Wingers actually hacked into the Affordable Care Act website and fouled it up- THAT'S why so many people had such a hard time accessing it.)",Olympus Has Fallen
56,leonblackwood,Die Hard in the White House! 7/10,7,26 August 2013,"Review: I quite enjoyed this Die Hard in the White House type of movie, but it doesn't have the wit and cockiness of Bruce Willis. That not to say that Gerard Butler didn't do a bad job, and its good to see him taking a break from them annoying Rom-Com's. The storyline is quite good and there is loads of action from beginning to end, which makes it feel shorter than 2 hours. The ending is a bit corny, and I'm sure that the body count is more than Rambo, but that's what makes the movie enjoyable. You can definitely tell we're the $70 million budget went with all of the explosions and plane crashes which looked pretty impressive. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After watching Morgan Freeman in Oblivion, the make up team obviously went for the old look because he looks like he needs to make another bucket list. Gerard Butler really did buff up for this film and he does pull off the whole action hero thing. I also liked the guy who played the villain because he was quite cool and collected and he never got excited, even tough he was going to blow up America. All of the other actors seemed to be dropping like flies throughout the movie but its a great watch.Budget: $70million Worldwide Gross: $161millionI recommend this movie to people who like there political action movies with a Die Hard concept!. 7/10",Olympus Has Fallen
57,TheMovieDiorama,Olympus Has Fallen ironically insults America's national security through lunacy and patriotism.,4,11 December 2019,"""Die Hard in the White House"" claims British lads' magazine Zoo, divulging into the testosterone-fuelled minds of its laddish readers. To be fair to them, Fuqua's patriotic perspective of a national terrorist attack is exactly that. A 'Die Hard' rip-off that relies on the same narrative rhythms beat-for-beat. One man, and only one man, can save the day by gradually depleting the numbers of the antagonistic gang that harness either monetary or diplomatic motives. But where the aforementioned feature excelled, this action extravaganza flopped.In apparently thirteen minutes, the entire Secret Service force is massacred at the hands of Korean ultra-nationalists, at the White House, in the middle of the day. ""The most secure building in the world"" exclaimed one of the useless decision makers attempting to assist the Acting President. Yeah. That's an armoury of irony right there. Olympus Has Fallen is so unrealistic in plot, that for the majority of its runtime you're left baffled as to how any of it was conceptualised. Fully trained Security guards joyfully skip towards barrages of bullets. Protocols are broken left, right and centre. The frickin' Army Chief of Staff sends a fleet of armed helicopters into a danger zone despite already acknowledging the opposition acquiring a ridiculously overpowered turret. Boom! Dead. The lack of intelligence for its characters is, quite frankly, insulting. Especially when this action blockbuster is supposed to be shrouded in patriotism.The worst offender though is the obtuse amount of horrifically rendered visual effects. From blatantly obvious green screens to clunky polygonal helicopters floating around aimlessly. It was as if the team played 'Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas' and directly extracted the models from it. Just woefully terrible. Fortunately Butler emanated his ""tough guy"" brutality in the central role, because he was continually stabbing Koreans through the skull, throat and legs. A convincingly physical role that was perfectly suited to his acting style, enabling him to destroy his opponents whilst injecting some light buoyancy. Unfortunately the screenplay is limited in the ""fun"" department, taking the narrative extremely seriously, which hindered the nostalgic cheesiness of 80s action blockbusters that Fuqua took inspiration from.Speaking of, his directing style was taut as expected, with much focus on the shenanigans taking place within the Presidential bunker. But the frenetic editing hindered his clarity. Eckhart provided strength as the President, but as usual, picks lacklustre films to repress his talent. Freeman shouted at one point and I quivered. Bassett, Mitchell and Yune were underused and Leo overacted. Oh, and who stops a countdown at three seconds? Let it go down to one! Create that suspense for flip sake!So yes, for thirsty action viewers who crave violence blended with one-dimensional characters, unintelligent plot points and obscene amounts of polygonal visual effects, Olympus Has Fallen has got you covered. However, if you prefer your action blockbusters with an ounce of excitement, might I suggest a minuscule film called 'Die Hard'?",Olympus Has Fallen

60,BeneCumb,Die Hard without soft humor - but with great supporting actors,7,29 June 2013,"It is tricky - and in many countries impossible - to create an artistic product where you see your state symbols and pillars destroyed and defeated, even for a short time. And manned invasion into the capital of the most powerful country in the world? Sounds crazy, thus I can imagine that many viewers find the plot's origin harebrained enough. Even in the context of a state visit, I think, the US special services would deal with and check the other party's attendants and would not authorize suspicious figures into the White House...However, this rather theoretical event is well directed and depicted, the ""good guys"" get killed too and easy moving by the protagonist in a White House and his capabilities and actions result from his past (I am usually perplexed when an ordinary/nerd citizen saves the world, becoming a skilled hero in numbered minutes). Nevertheless, the plot includes several odd and improbable scenes, e.g. the method of communication between Banning and the statesmen: is it difficult to trace a phone call when/if you are able to control the nuclear arsenal?! Or Banning's smooth entering into the White House during heavy attack? It is better to concentrate on one-man's fight instead.As for the cast, I enjoyed supporting actors most: Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Rick Yune. My attitude towards Gerard Butler has always been mixed as he is too ""serious"" and ""arid"", more than e.g. Daniel Craig. Perhaps he is more credible tough guy than Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson, but the latter are more pleasant to follow.Nevertheless, it is okay killing time, far better than the last Die Hard. If you like political thrillers with fierce fights, you will not have blah-feelings.",Olympus Has Fallen
61,thinker1691,""" When all else fails, trusts only that which proves you right """,9,18 August 2013,"Antoine Fuqua adroitly directs this innovative and virtual reality based action movie. Written by Creighton Rothenberger, I conclude this author and his colleague certainly know how to weave a fantastic story. Fuqua's exceptional guidance shines through this explosive and energetic film. His flair is to begin like a Saturn Rocket which reaches new heights in entertainment and excitement and shoot towards the stars. Indeed, from the onset the audience gathers curiously to become endeared to the major characters like Gerard Butler (Three Hundred) who plays Mike Banning, the ex-Special Forces soldier, Aaron Eckhard (The Core) as President Benjamin Asher and Morgan Freeman as the Speaker of the house. Together they create a superb cast which cinematically adds terrifying escalation and serious reality to a well written and imaginative script. The heavies are led by a sinister, manipulative, cleverly determined but seriously disturb enemy called Kang (Rick Yune). From the onset the creative director gives an unsuspecting audience waves and waves of stark murderous drama with explosive and terrifying aerial scenes. The story encapsulates the story of a Secret Servicw agent with a blemish record, who finds himself among the few survivors left to defend The White House and a captive President. Still the invaders leave little doubt that they intend to destroy the United States and anyone who resist them. So little is left even the audience is convinced all is lost. For the record, this is one film which is easily recommended and will also go the distance to become a great Classic. ****",Olympus Has Fallen

Way better than A Good Day To Die Hard, the action and the violence was not glorified like a typical action film like mode, it felt very real, like this is really happening.

The supporting cast does not disappoint either. Rick Yune was a terrifying bad guy.",Olympus Has Fallen
63,freemantle_uk,Pure American Cheese,5,9 August 2014,"Olympus Has Fallen is pure cheese, a film designed to get American audiences to chant USA, USA despite having a lead actor barely being able to do an American accent. This is a film with a hacky script, being compared to Die Hard and clearly been influenced by 24. The writing and plot points is predictable, most of the cast are slumming it for a paycheck and the CGI is on the same level as straight-to-DVD film. Director Antoine Fuqua wants to be a low budget Michael Bay as he shows the destruction of many American momentums, military planning and action and the wounded American flag as the nation suffers a shock before a triumphant return. The film even ends up on a clichéd ticking time bomb situation.Olympus Has Fallen's strongest feature is its violence: it is a hard-R as blood is spilled and bones are broken. One of the best sequences is when the North Koreans storm the White House and battle the Secret Service.Olympus Has Fallen is entertainingly silly where you can play a drinking game about the clichés and plot holes, but if you want a better quality about the American president in peril watch White House Down or Air Force One instead.",Olympus Has Fallen
64,PWNYCNY,Nonstop action.,10,25 March 2013,"Hold onto to your hat because this movie takes you for a ride. This movie has nonstop action as a team of terrorists storm into and take over the White House in a bid to destroy the United States. The idea of a team of ruthless and determined terrorists infiltrating the security apparatus of a country is nothing new. There have always been traitors who will sell out their country. They exploit the complacency that comes with being a great power, a complacency based on the belief that it can't happen here. And when their guard is down, wham! What makes this movie unique, however, is how it graphically shows how the White House can be stormed and the President and Vice President be taken hostage. Such a scenario is plausible, which adds an element of authenticity to the movie making it that much stronger dramatically. The question is: how to respond. The story revolves around that question as government officials, led by an acting-president who is a legislator and not an executive, are forced to make difficult decisions under extreme pressure that could lead to worldwide instability and disaster. This movie calls attention to the fragile nature of the chain of command and how a security breach can put an entire country at risk. Melissa Leo gives an outstanding performance as the Secretary of Defense, and Gerard Butler is excellent as a discredited secret service agent who is given a chance to redeem himself. This movie is worth watching.",Olympus Has Fallen

66,tadpole-596-918256,Tear it down now!,6,14 April 2013,"If you have had a course in current events, as have I, you may recall the Washington Monument in the District of Columbia (some neo-Egyptian design foisted upon a simpler public as a tourist attraction in the 1800s) was closed for months after the Virginia earthquake struck the East Coast a couple years back, leaving it cracked. In OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (""Olympus"" being a U.S. Secret Service code name for the President or White House or something), what falls the hardest is the Washington Monument. The top of this decaying phallic symbol is nicked by the wing of a disabled aircraft, shattering it like the decrepit ruin it has become. In a scene not unlike the Twin Towers toppling on Sept. 11, the top third of the obelisk pancakes down on the lower portion, and the inevitable crowd of people standing below have nowhere to run. The toll on the American tourist population is heavy, and with future earthquakes, super-storms, terrorist attacks, and whatnot, this is an inevitable disaster likely to happen sooner rather than later. I say dismantle this example of urban blight NOW (the White House, Vietnam Memorial, and JFK's grave should still be enough to attract the history buff tourist trade, the only reason for Faulty Tower's existence). Until this can be done, at least get signed release forms from anyone who is allowed to venture within a half mile of this death trap, so their survivors cannot turn around and sue the rest of us taxpayers for millions if they're crushed by this grandfathered-in attractive nuisance.",Olympus Has Fallen
67,alindsay-al,A possible new Die Hard with a fun time,7,18 June 2014,"This is a fun film and nothing else really, this is just 2 hours of pure fun and sometimes that is good and this is one of those films. Ex Secret service member Michael Banning is the only man who can save the president of the united States from a North Korean Terrorist group attacking the white house. Gerard Butler is a good lead and is a great action hero with some one liners reminding me of a Die Hard film or an Arnold film. Aaron Eckhart is a great president and truly makes out like a president should be in a film like this in this situation. The Villain was good in his role as a seemingly generic terrorist and Morgan Freeman is great as the speaker and really does steal the show at a few points. The Story is pretty generic and really could be argued to be the biggest weakness as it really is as generic as possible and similar to previous films. Also the script is okay but it could have been better in these circumstances. The style though is really cool and the cinematography shows just how high the stakes are in this film and how important this film really is. Also the fact that this is an 18 means they take the violence up and it grounds this film in much more reality then films such as White House Down. This is a great action film and I believe that this is a good step for action films.",Olympus Has Fallen
68,estebangonzalez10,Appeals to your patriotism but very silly movie,5,12 July 2013,"¨United States of America doesn't negotiate with terrorists.¨Olympus Has Fallen reminded me a lot of those action films in the 90's that I grew up loving. The only problem is that I just don't feel the same way about those movies anymore. These action packed films follow a very similar formula and despite the great performance from Gerard Butler in the lead role I couldn't help but feel that the film lacked originality. I felt the tension and the suspense while I was watching this action packed film, but at the same time I kept on thinking to myself how stupid the plot was. This is a film that would have been a lot better if it used some comedy and didn't take itself so seriously. A lot of comparisons to Die Hard have been made because it follows pretty much the same exact formula, except for the fact that Die Hard had some comedic moments that allowed the audience to not take everything so seriously. This could have been a great plot for a Die Hard film. Antoine Fuqua has made some great films, but none of them have reached the potential of his 2001 Training Day. Olympus Has Fallen is an improvement over Tears of the Sun and King Arthur, but Fuqua still hasn't managed to deliver as strong a film as he did with that one starring Denzel Washington. I wasn't won over by this film, but I think it will win a lot of fans due to the action packed thrills and great performances by the strong cast. It was a lot better than what I thought it would be.The film centers on Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) a former President Guard who is sent to work for the Treasury Department after the President's (Aaron Eckhart) wife passes away in a terrible traffic accident. Banning hates his new desk job and desperately wants back in at the White House. The opportunity comes when a terrorist group from North Korea attacks the Oval office and holds the President hostage in the bunker along with several other important American officials. Despite the Army and Secret Service's efforts they could do nothing to prevent the attack, and the only man inside the White House that can do something is Banning. Meanwhile the Speaker of the House, Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) is now in charge of the country and begins communicating with the terrorist leader, Kang (Rick Yune) who makes his demands. The people from the Pentagon are forced to put their trust on Banning who is the only man who can give them inside information. This is Banning's opportunity for redemption as the President's life is on the line.Despite being formulaic, the film does something a little different. There are several casualties here as several civilians get killed. People who still suffer from post 9-11 trauma might want to stay away from this movie because there are a lot of scenes that will remind them of that episode. The action is packed and there are several moments of tension because several people are killed off. Fuqua wasn't afraid to show the amount of casualties lost from the attack. Other than that the film follows pretty much the same formula action junkies have come to love from action films like Die Hard, Air Force One, and Con Air. Despite the silliness of the premise, many people might enjoy this film. It was a lot better than I expected, but I still can't recommend it for its lack of originality. Olympus Has Fallen is loud, action-packed, and appeals to your patriotic senses.",Olympus Has Fallen
69,iquine,Excuse to CGI Bomb DC,3,13 February 2020,"(Flash Review)Even in the genre of brainless, blood-riddling action, you will shake your head every EIGHT minutes due to preposterous disbelief of character decision, indecision or radically ridiculous story situations. Even with a significant amount of firepower, the most sophisticated and intensely guarded building in America is easily taken by force; The White House. It gets even more irritatingly ridiculous when the President is captured and held hostage, in a bunker underground, along with the two other people who hold all three codes needed to access America's nuclear war chest. Thus the bad guys try to extract the codes from those people. How many codes, if any, will they acquire?

I don't just mean it has a lot of action or wide-scale destruction (Which is check, and check), I mean it's graphically, uncompromisingly, violent. However, the violence gives the proceedings—which might have otherwise just been another in a long line of uneven 'Die Hard' knock-offs—some weight. The other factor working in its favor; the cast. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Rick Yune and even Ashley Judd in a small role. Good actors always lift the material, and that's certainly true here. 'Olympus Has Fallen' isn't exactly original, nor does it reach the heights of 'Die Hard', but it is a tense action thriller that asks nothing more of us than to sit back and be entertained. Mission accomplished.",Olympus Has Fallen
71,mattkratz,not bad,8,24 February 2014,"This and White House Down were released at about the same time as two movies about the White House being attacked, and someone on his own and on the outside having to come to the rescue and guard it. This could have been a little better, as Gerard Butler is a disgraced Secret Service Agent (he failed to act sufficiently when the First Lady died in a car accident) has to come to the rescue when the North Koreans (they seem to have taken the place of the Soviet Union as the main enemy in American movies now!) attack the White House and hold the President and other key people hostage and have other sinister plans in mind.This wasn't too bad, but I would have ranked WHD as better. Butler was good in the lead, and the rest of the cast was good too, and there were some good action scenes, but I was just more impressed by the other movie. This was PRETTY good though. I might recommend it if you are into peril movies-there was certainly a lot of peril in it! ** 1/2 out of ****",Olympus Has Fallen
72,juneebuggy,"If you love a hero and just go along for the ride, its pretty good.",7,22 September 2015,"Olympus Has Fallen is a fast paced, incredibly violent, action extravaganza with solid performances from its (more than decent) cast. However the story is also implausible and takes a high level of just letting go to be fully enjoyed. Along the lines of ""Die Hard"", this is action, violence and spraying bullets from beginning to end. Ultimately if you love a hero and just go along for the ride, its pretty good.I'll admit when I saw Morgan Freeman's name attached to this I just assumed he would be the president -shouldn't he always be the president? Anyways that role belongs to Aaron Eckhart here. The initially ""taking"" of the Whitehouse is extreme, involving a body count of epic proportions as the bad guys take out and destroy everything in their path to gain access. This sequence was... I want to say well done, I don't know how feasible it would be, they made it look easy, it was exciting as hell to watch though.The story follows Gerard Butler as former secret service agent Mike Banning who just happens to be nearby when the sh!t hits the fan. Banning makes his way through the bodies and into the crumbling Whitehouse, then using his inside knowledge and working with national security he goes about taking down the terrorists and rescuing the President. Butler is bad ass here, holding his own and taking no prisoners, He has several exciting fight sequences and for whatever reason there are also several knife fights involved despite the amount of guns lying around.Enjoyed Rick Yune as the bad guy, very cold and calculated -many hostesses get a bullet to the head on live TV- and the extended cast is good too including Melissa Leo, Angela Bassett, Ashley Judd, Dylan McDermott and yes Morgan Freeman who does get to be President for a while.As with all these types of movies much flag waving and rah-rahing is done at the end as patriotism takes over. 9/14/15",Olympus Has Fallen
73,kluseba,A gripping action thriller with minimal propaganda tendencies,8,29 March 2013,"This movie is an entertaining, action and tension filled thriller in the key of the Die Hard series where terrorists attack the White House from the inside and menace American society and have to be stopped by a disgraced lone wolf who wants to clear his name and save his country.From the dramatic opening scene to the tension filled ending, this movie is a breathless hunt. The action scenes are off course a little bit overproduced but it's better than other recent Hollywood flicks like ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" that simply go too far with their special effects and feel rather ridiculous in the end. The story line is definitely nothing new but the intensity and the surprisingly solid acting Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman and antagonist Rick Yune make this movie one of the better of its popular and repetitive kind. On a personal note, I might also add supporting actress Malana Lea who doesn't have a big role but who perfectly incarnates the devil in disguise, a breathtaking beauty with a truly evil side. Nevertheless, the movie has a couple of flaws. It's not quite clear what happens to the First Lady in the beginning of the movie. I thought the accident scene on the bridge was somewhat strange. Was it a simple accident or an attack from the outside? The movie includes other strange moments. The role of the character played by Dylan McDermott remains mysterious. One gets no credible reason for his negative attitude as well as for his sudden change of mind. It's also strange that he isn't used by the main actor after his change of mind to mix up things in the bunker of the White House. His role could have been a lot more profound and he could have been the changing element of the whole story. Instead, his fate is quickly abandoned. Let's add also that even the intentions of the antagonists remain somewhat superficial. How did they all infiltrate the South Korean government as well as the United States of America and what are the true convictions and reasons behind their actions? I'm aware of the fact that this flick is meant to be a straight action thriller but a little bit more depth would have been a great deal as well to stand out of all these quite similar movies.Once again, I must also add that this film includes mild propaganda elements. It's not as evident as in ""Red Dawn"" but maybe similar to ""Argo"". Instead of choosing mafia bosses, radical American terrorists who want to destroy their own government or an international gangster organization, it had to be once again pro North Korea terrorists. This movie underlines in a subtle way how dangerous this American enemy could be and what could eventually happen if one didn't try to prevent them from doing what they do. I think that arts and politics shouldn't mix too much. There have been plenty of patriotic war movies after the 9/11 incident and they surely had their reasons to be there. After a few years, these patriotic movies disappeared but now they seem to have come back over the last three years or so for no apparent reason. These slight propaganda attitudes seem to have for goal to challenge the nation's enemies and to make people believe that the United States of America are still going strong despite the economic crisis and the events that made Afghanistan and Iraq a second or third Vietnam. I would have liked this movie more if the terrorists had not been stereotypes of an American enemy.Despite these few flaws, this movie is truly entertaining and among the strongest films of the not so young year 2013. I recommend you to watch this film in your local cinemas to be able to appreciate the great sound and special effects it has.

76,3xHCCH,Why Did the US Allow a Film Like This Now?,5,10 April 2013,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" has been called by various critics as ""Die Hard in the White House"" because that is exactly what it is. The White House was attacked and taken over by a crazy North Korean terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) and his posse. The President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) himself was held hostage with his closest staff. The entire presidential security in the palace had been ALL killed off. Well, that is, except for one Mike Banning (Gerald Butler), who had been removed from the close-in security of the POTUS because of a lapse of judgment 18 months ago. As would be expected in a pseudo-""Die Hard"" film like this, Banning single-handedly outwits and disposes all the bad guys, averts a nuclear attack against the US in the nick of time, leading to the melodramatic uber-patriotic speech from the rescued President that we had anticipated from the start.As an action film it was quite good. We just have to shut our brain off for two hours and not think. We do not get spared from violent fight scenes which were graphic and bloody, and that is good since we came into this film expecting an adrenaline rush, and indeed we will get that.Let us just disregard certain unbelievable plot holes, such why Banning security status was still active 18 months after he lost his job as Presidential Security, or how the terrorist was able to get the final secret code without the POTUS giving it to them, among many other questions. You are not supposed to notice these things anymore.The release of this film is as timely as could be as North Korea positions itself as an aggressor in real world politics, declaring war on South Korea, and practically, the USA as well by extension. I am just wondering why the US would allow a movie showing their White House so weak in security or their President so weak in resolve. Do these really fire up patriotic fervor, or raise more questions about Washington would do in a crisis like this?",Olympus Has Fallen
77,TdSmth5,Faulty but entertaining,6,25 September 2013,"In the intro we meet the presidential family as they're about to leave Camp David. We also meet several Secret Service agents, among them Banning the main guy, and Forbes. It's winter and something crashed into one the motorcade vehicle's windshield causing them to spin out of control and the presidential limo crashed through a bridge's rail hanging over the precipice. As Banning rescues the pres, the limo falls and the president's wife dies.Five years later, Banning has been demoted to some desk job at Treasury. Forbes is now the main guy in charge of the president's security. It's the day that the South Korean delegation is visiting the White House. Suddenly a USAF military cargo plane piloted by Asians flies over DC and starts shooting everything in its path. As it approaches restricted airspace, 2 fighter planes are dispatched, buy they are destroyed by the cargo plane. Eventually it's shot down near the White House. As Banning sees all this from his window he rushes to the WH. Now waste disposal trucks and armored cars stop in front of the WH and dozens of heavily armed guys appear and shot at WH security and breach the fence, make their way in and kill everyone.Meanwhile inside security protocol starts and the pres, vice pres, defense secretary, and some military guy are taken to the bunker. Breaking protocol, the president insists that the Korean delegation also be taken into the bunker. Big Mistake. As it turns out some in the delegation are on the enemy's side and take everyone in the bunker hostage, with the help of Forbes! Now the speaker of the house becomes president and runs the crisis center, while we learn about the main bad guy's intentions. He needs 3 codes from three different officials to get Cerberus online, which is the US missile defense system. Banning got into the WH and is starting to investigate and get in contact with the crisis center. The president's son in somewhere in the WH and everyone is looking for him. The US launches an attack with choppers but is quickly repelled by an advanced WH defense system, that no one knew about and which wasn't used against the cargo plane for some reason.For the scenario to work a lot of improbable things have to happen in this movie. And they really push it; the audience has to put up with a lot of illogical and unrealistic things. The action is great all around. The operation to take over the WH is very well conceived. Of course it relies on the passivity of the entire security apparatus. Butler makes a good, likable hero. Yune makes a good dislikeable nemesis. The issue with the son was handled very well, it could have been handled much worse to provoke tears. Unfortunately, technically this movie isn't convincing. The CGI effects are horrible for this day and age. The pompous grandiose music is similarly archaic and cheesy. Editing is also problematic. They clearly ran out of time near the end when things happen suddenly without explanation and for no reason. You can tell when 15 minutes or so before the end, it's as if they've realized that they're out of time or are missing footage that would fill in some gaps. Overall an entertaining summer movie.",Olympus Has Fallen
78,aharmas,Now This is An Explosive Movie Cast and Movie!!!!,10,24 March 2013,"What a rebound from that horrible disappointment in December that passed itself as thriller... Here is a film that delivers, has us caring for the good guys and hissing at the evil forces. There are plenty of explosions, twists and turns, and a leading man with a face, flaws, a heart, and a mission, and yes! there is suspension of disbelief, but it's been a while since we had a film was thrilling to watch, that didn't have looking at me watch or running outside to the bathroom or to text that I regretted spending my cash.The White House is attacked and half destroyed by an evil terrorist that has the world on the brink of destruction. Suddenly we have a worthy villain who recalls the bad guys from the James Bond thrillers, but there is more special effects, and in the middle of all the debris flying around, the sequence and cool editing actually make sense. Contrary to those Michael Bay films where things are blown up just because we have the budget, this one has bodies falling, buildings crumbling, but we actually hold our collective breath, as it looks like it just couldn't get any worse.We know we will be shocked when the First Lady is gone in the first ten minutes of the thriller, but we have no time to get over our shock as hell breaks loose outside, over, inside, and under Washington, D.C. Before we can say, what the..., Gerald Butler in his best impersonation of James Bond, Indiana Jones, a few Mission Impossible heroes, we have people being executed, children in danger, some cool technological moves, and in one of the best supporting entries of any year, Morgan Freeman as acting president. It's details like that makes one enjoy this film. The film is just fun to watch, and there's enough good acting not to regret this guilty pleasure.You know that in the end, things will be o.k., and there are plenty of clichés along the way, but when the mix is just right, the result is pretty enjoyable. There is going to be a sequel, and we want it soon, and as good as this one.",Olympus Has Fallen

Flynn's book was a lot more exciting because it focused on the hero, in this story's case Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), and not on all the extraneous people in the Pentagon or Homeland Security. Now, I love Morgan Freeman, but there just wasn't any point to anything taking place outside the White House.It also had a great character supporting the hero, a female Secret Service Agent, I think on the job for one day.Everything was predictable; there were no surprises.

82,Sherazade,A Grittier Version of 'White House Down',8,2 June 2014,"as if that is even possible because in all actuality both films packed a wallop. I liked this one better because I felt Gerard Butler (who plays the lead here) had more to prove than Channing Tatum did in 'White House Down' and the former's character was more skillful than the latter though it most be said that the former was already a former secret service agent, no pun intended. I'd recommend both films but watch this one first if you're into a strong plot being laid out before all the action begins and serious characters actually acting with a purpose as opposed to ridiculous scenarios playing out as a set up for the bad things that were about there take place as was often the case with 'White House Down.'

The movie should really have been focusing on building up the Korean side of the background instead.The characters have quite an unbalanced portions on screen, whereas they're played by well known faces, like Ashley Judd's performance here. This makes for quite a waste of talent. The action sequences are great in overall I personally like the initial invasion sequence. It feels fast,colossal and and looks real enough. All the gun fights and hand-to- hand combats are also quite nice with shots and angles making it easier to enjoy the sequences. What's quite stupid to see is all those fake squib bullets that only throw a small blood splatter on the shirts without creating a hole on the shirts. The acting is quite nice, Gerard Butler nailed the action sequences well, although he should have increased his dramatic performance. Morgan Freeman acted well here and I think he should have been given a bigger portion of significance. Aaron Eckhart appears kind of funny as the lame president here.",Olympus Has Fallen
84,Rob_Taylor,Die Hard with a Spartan!,6,2 July 2013,"Olympus isn't a bad movie and, as an action-fest, holds up quite well. It suffers from a number of clichés and problems typical of the genre but keeps you watching nonetheless.There is a point, however, where the film, which up until that point has been quite sensible, loses its own plot quite comprehensively.That point is when, having kow-towed to the terrorist demands by withdrawing the fleet, the good guys believe the President has been killed. Since they withdrew the fleet in order to keep him alive, it would then make sense for the good guys to send the fleet back in (it literally couldn't have gone more than a few miles in the timescale involved).Instead, they wring their hands over the apparent death of the Pres and look at one another with horror, preparing...oh wait... I forgot. That wasn't the point in the story where it went pear-shaped.That point was, in fact, when they agreed to sacrifice the lives of countless thousands, if not tens of thousands, by withdrawing the fleet in the first place to save one man. That is essentially what they did. I'm pretty sure that no man, even the President of the USA, is worth risking a nuclear war over.Of course, the Pres isn't really dead. Gasp! He's still quite alive. Which is puzzling, because the bad guys figured out the last code they needed to cripple the US nuke arsenal, so all that leaving him alive accomplished was risking him deactivating the crippling mechanism later. Guess what happens? Bah! You lot are too clever! Anyway. What else was dumb in the film? Let's see. Oh yeah! So there's this mechanism that cripples nukes. Basically, a self-destruct mechanism that is designed to destroy the missiles if they are launched by accident. Except... it appears that the mechanism supposedly doesn't just destroy them by using a conventional charge to destroy the missile. It actually detonates the nuclear warhead! Wow! What a great idea! Not! Not only that, but the nuke destruct system completely overrides any failsafe systems, allowing the bad guys to potentially blow the nukes up in the silos! Yeah, you're thinking what I'm thinking, right? A crock of excrement! It gets better! The only person who has a code to deactivate the system is the Pres and the only place that it can be deactivated from is the White House bunker where they are all trapped! Err... okay.Seriously. Is this what scriptwriters get up to these days? Thinking up dumb plot devices to further a weak story? A moment's thought....just a moment... would suffice to see how dumb the above idea was and how unlikely it would be to ever be built in reality.I know! I shouldn't overthink it. It's a dumb action movie. That, however, is the exact point. It is a DUMB action movie. Not only that, but they seem to be getting dumber as time goes by. That, or I'm getting less tolerant of the stupid.Anyway, other than when the film becomes DUMB, it isn't bad. Which is to say, the first two-thirds of it, or so. After that point, turn your brain to the ""off"" position and you'll enjoy the rest of it. Sadly, I don't have that switch, so...SUMMARY: Alright until the dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers moment kicks in.

The hero must always be out to redeem themselves.We then pointlessly jump ahead 18 months...Sequence of the actual siege/ takeover of the White House starts out okay, but then goes off into overly violent video game territory, and goes on forever. Later scenes make US military seem invincible, but here they fall like dominos.Video game political thriller goes off into Die Hard territory: hero-meets-villain confrontation in Die Hard is a hero-meets-traitor scene here, right down to the slightly tilted camera-work.Stupidly, insultingly, film falls into the ""big action scene/ one-liner"" rut: even as president and fallen-hero-now-redeemed walk out of destroyed White House at the end, walking over dead bodies of their friends and comrades, the pres feels obligated to quip: ""Don't worry, I think it's insured"" Are you serious? Were we supposed to laugh? Was that supposed to break the tension? It failed miserably on both counts.Some good action scenes, but zero brains. Film might have worked as a political thriller, but went off into Die Hard-clone territory, with an indestructible one-man army taking out an army of terrorists.Note to the filmmakers: it's called the White House, not Whitehouse.

89,bkrauser-81-311064,Like Die Hard but in the...Who Cares?,5,10 January 2014,"stupid is as stupid does and Olympus Has Fallen is a hive abuzz with stupidity. The story begins with the tragic death of the first lady (Ashley Judd) after a car crash at Camp David. A few months later, Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) was the last to have a chance to save her and thus works a desk job at the Treasury instead of by the President's side. But Mike's fate is about to change when a South Korean envoy comes to town for talks with the President (Aaron Eckhart).North Korean terrorists then make their play by shooting people from a bomber, destroying the Washington Monument and making a full frontal assault on the White House. Within minutes the entire Secret Service and White House staff, sans the President and a few red shirts are dead. With no hope of saving the President the acting President, Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) has no choice but to bomb the crap out of the bastards.Oh, wait that never comes to mind, not once. For while our country is more important than one man especially in the face of possible nuclear annihilation, the whole focus of the film is on saving Aaron Eckhart from the clutches of the terrorist known as Kang (Rick Yune) not on the good of the nation. Banning becomes the one unstoppable force who picks the bad guys off one at a time where the Secret Service, the military, the D.C. Police, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Cole Hauser have all failed. When the deciders in comfy chairs opt to do something without Banning, it's an unmitigated disaster. Why can't military brass simply listen to the laws of action movie logic and let the lone guy put in an extraordinary situation do his thang? While the logical fallacies in this film are a-plenty one can't but help admiring this throwback. There is no sense of irony or self-effacement like in the similarly themed White House Down (2013). No wisecracks or filler, just non-stop action. It's a retread of the highest order. If it were made twenty years ago and made a little more sense it might have made the shortlist of decent Die Hard (1988) rip-offs like Speed (1994) or The Rock (1996).Unfortunately between Morgan Freeman's disinterested gaze and Melissa Leo's hammy performance as the Secretary of Defense, Olympus Has Fallen feels like a recitation of clichés by gifted amateurs. Dylan McDermott's performance as the resident traitor is especially daffy. Watching the scene where he justifies his betrayal to the President is just moronic and helps explain why he has been relegated to disposable romantic leading man status.I was willing to meet this movie half way. I swallowed the notion of the White House being taken over by terrorists even though I'm sure there are a small amount of Secret Service agents out there who sat down to watch this movie and laughed their butts off. But the lack of common sense on a basic level in addition to the questionable amount of damage Butler's body can endure, As it stands, this movie has a shelf-life of five minutes.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Olympus Has Fallen
90,moviexclusive,"Taut, brutal and relentlessly thrilling, this high-concept 'White House Down' thriller is a modern-day 'Die Hard' done to perfection",8,7 April 2013,"Twelve years after the events of September 11, Hollywood offers up one of America's most prominent landmarks for devastation by hostile foreign elements – and if that isn't bad enough, then how about the fact that it isn't just submitting one, but two different hypothetical scenarios how such an unthinkable catastrophe might just occur. Yes, 'Olympus Has Fallen' comes as the first of two products of Hollywood imagination about the fall of the White House – the next being Roland Emmerich's 'White House Down' timed for this summer – and besides having the advantage of being first out of the court, it is also likely to resonate more no thanks to the current geopolitical climate.Whether out of prescience or sheer coincidence, first-time screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt imagine a surprise attack by the North Koreans on American soil just as the South Korean President calls in on ruling American President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) following weeks of rising tensions along the DMZ border. Sound familiar? Well, Rothenberger and Benedikt's clairvoyance goes one step further by adding a nuclear element to the unfolding proceedings, with the Korean terrorists aiming to gain control of a fictional top-secret denuclearisation system by the US called Cerberus.With the added frisson of timeliness, director Antoine Fuqua's throwback to the retro- thrillers of the 80s and 90s (think Die Hard or Lethal Weapon) acquires a fresh new edge, complemented by his flair for staging over-the-top action sequences. Nowhere is the latter more evident than in the swift, vicious and yet downright exhilarating scene-setting sequence that is thankfully more realistic and coherent than what the trailer hints at – essentially a two-pronged attack with the first being an air attack from a low-flying cargo plane and the second being a ground assault from a busload of tourists.What follows is standard action-thriller stuff done absolutely right, the narrative built around that of a disgraced law enforcement official given a chance to redeem himself by saving the day – and of course the President. That hero is former top Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), who in the opening prologue is made a pariah when a freak accident claims the life of the First Lady (Ashley Judd in a sparkling cameo). Transferred to the neighbouring Treasury building, Mike hopes to get his old job next to the President in the White House back, but his director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) tells him that Asher is not ready just yet.Amid the hail of gunfire and explosions, Mike becomes the only point of friendly contact from within the White House, feeding intel to his bosses at the Pentagon – including the gung-ho Head of the Joint Chiefs General Clegg (Robert Forster) as well as the Speaker of the House and Acting President Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman). And as the terrorists led by the megalomaniac Kang (Die Another Day's Rick Yune) have the President and his aides held hostage in the White House's emergency underground bunker, it will also come to Rick to take down the terrorists one by one.Comparisons with 'Die Hard' are absolutely valid, but that familiarity in no way diminishes the guilty pleasures one gets from watching Fuqua's film. Best known for directing Denzel Washington to a Best Actor Oscar in 'Training Day', Fuqua has never been one for subtlety, but his lack of restraint accounts for much of the film's infectious thrills. The patriotism is overwrought – a tattered American flag falling slowly from the roof of the White House against a flame-red sunset – but there's no denying its impact in emphasising the extent of the disaster. Banning's taunts against his enemy are largely cheesy, but they do add gusto to the enmity between him and Kang, particularly in the context of the final showdown in which Banning promises to 'put a knife through Kang's brain'.Nonetheless all that is just icing for the cake – what we are really here to see is Banning kick ass, and indeed Fuqua doesn't disappoint. After that awesome takeover of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Fuqua lets the movie settle into a taut cat-and-mouse game within the many rooms, darkened hallways and secret passageways of the White House, with Banning's previous experience putting him in good stead to outwit and out-manoeuvre Kang's gang of well-trained, black-clad commandos. The ensuing series of close-combat fights are brutal and pulse-pounding, though not without a wicked sense of humour – one we particularly enjoyed was that where Banning uses a heavy bust of Lincoln's head to knock a baddie out cold.The hard-hitting role also gives Butler a chance to return to his R- rated action hero roots from which a certain movie called '300' sprung him into fame. Butler channels his best Bruce Willis here – complete with the latter's signature mix of wisecracks and threats – but goes beyond a carbon copy of John McClane by putting his physicality to good use throughout the many mano-a-mano scenes in the film. He also has a surprisingly strong ensemble cast for support – besides those mentioned earlier, there's also Academy Award winner Melissa Leo as the defiant Secretary of Defense who gets an especially unceremonious treatment by Kang.But 'Olympus Has Fallen' isn't a movie about niceties nor any sort of nuances; this is an unabashed remake of 'Die Hard' – right down to a rooftop adventure gone bad – that revels in its desire to satisfy audiences starved of the kind of the tough bloody action that such unapologetically entertaining thrillers of the past used to offer. Yes indeed, the premise that one man should save the day might seem like a hoary cliché, but let's face it, plot and originality are not the priorities here. Instead, Fuqua delivers thrill after thrill with brutal adrenaline-pumping precision, and as a diverting slice of action entertainment, it is as perfect as it gets.",Olympus Has Fallen
91,Luigi Di Pilla,Solid popcorn thriller,7,26 October 2014,"Come on people, Olympus Has Fallen is not as bad as many reviews here say. Director Fuqua knows no doubt how to create a master work of suspense and thriller. Okay, this is all déjà vu before in other action films. But the story and the elements are well developed here. At beginning It shows a careful introduction of the characters. Then, the nightmare begins slowly and reaches a high level of fast pace. Believe me, my adrenalin went more and more up until the end. There were several bloody and brutal combats and fights. Sometimes I thought to assist a real terrorist scene. The menaces of these terrorists are well studied and I imagine even the White House Security had made some checks after having seen this apocalyptic blockbuster. The music was good. If you like another terror movie of this genre then see White House Down.Final rating: solid 7/10",Olympus Has Fallen
92,intelearts,"542nd Review: Awful xenophobic action thriller - and very 80s with it, meh...",2,29 June 2013,"This is exactly the sort of film that bankrolled the 80s - if you've seen Under Siege with Steven Segal, or a host of others where one man saves America à la Rambo then you've seen this. Half way through I expected to hear a platoon of marines cheering behind me - it is anachronistically gung-ho, and frankly, its republican isolationist take on America couldn't be more out of step with the world at large, or America today come to that, but maybe that's a side issue - is it a good action movie?Well, yes, in a way it is - if killing and guns without reason rock your boat then you'll be thrilled - provided you leave your morals and your brains outside the cinema who knows maybe you might enjoy this by the numbers claptrap. This film doesn't need plot spoilers cos you know what's going to happen way before it does - it doesn't have an original scene - so instead opts for greater body counts and more explosions - and never mind logic or sense.All in all, if you're 14 and a bit gung-ho you'll love it - adults with a more discerning view of the world will find its depiction of America as hated by and hating all foreigners and longing for the return of the Great Western hero completely numbing and deadening. It is a film that glorifies the worse possible impression of Americana relentlessly glorifying in despising others and glorifying ourselves.Butler et al do a bang-up job, but frankly it is such an old-fashioned film and so clichéed it would be an easy film to snigger at if it was horribly mock-serious about the gruesome and sadistic deaths involved. Storming the White House would have been a neat idea 25 years ago - now it all looks simply datedAll in all, if you absolutely love violent action films about saving the President, then no negative reviews are going to put you off, but if you've got an ounce of conscience and a reasonable IQ you really shouldn't be giving your money to support such blatantly xenophobic crap.",Olympus Has Fallen

95,DJAkin,Die Hard at the White House,10,23 March 2013,"This is by far the best action movie I have seen since the first Die Hard. When I went to this movie, I was not sure what to expect. Jake said it sounds like a tired formula. Well, as fate would have it, this was an improvement on the formula used in Die Hard. The bad guys were the Koreans in this movie. Gerard Butler, who is nothing short of a genius, delivered the goods. This movie had all the right components of a good action flick. There was a protagonist and an antagonist. There are several components that make a movie great. Movies are often more than just entertainment. If you can sit through a movie and believe they are set in a certain place, believe that the actors are not actors, then the movie has at least done part of a job. This movie does JUST THAT. The way the plane flew into the white house was amazing. I liked that button that the pilot pushed to make the missiles not hit them. What I was surprised about is that this is basically an instruction manual on the big screen. What is it an instruction manual for? How to take over the white house! I sure hope no bad guys watch this movie because there is a lot of stuff in this movie that the terrorists probably never knew how to do but now they do. I know a lot about The White House and the secret passageways. The president was played by Morgan Freeman who is nothing short of a genius when it comes to playing the president. He was actually the house speaker but was the temporary POTUS. I was surprised that Gerard only had one handgun and was able to get so far. Then again, this IS a movie. As a photographer, my favorite component is Cinematography. It is what is considered the visual beauty of the film. Many movies through out time have displayed great photography, whether it is of landscape, how a shot was made or sweeping camera angles. Often times this can make an average story a great movie. Olympus has fallen has some of the most amazing Cinematography ever! All in all, it really comes down to how the story is told - which is essentially all things combined. Olympus has Fallen is a great example that perfectly blends all together - all are above average as pieces, but combined - wow - it is a sweeping big screen picture as big as Morgan Freeman himself. Like I said, this movie was so good. I can't wait to see it on DVD. This is what screenwriters and directors should watch so that they can be inspired.",Olympus Has Fallen

There really is no real story in this movie, other than an attack on the White House.

Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, who is basically just British John McClane. And then we have Aaron Eckhart as Benjamin Asher, the POTUS and Morgan Freeman as Allan Trumbull, the public speaker. They are very good too. This is just a very dumb action movie, and those are the kind of movies that I really love to watch.",Olympus Has Fallen
97,Screen_Blitz,Pulse-pounding patriotic action thriller with dazzling special effects,7,29 October 2016,"There isn't much novelty to be found here, nor does it come nearly as ambitious as many classic films of the action genre. It doesn't mean it can't be fun however, or at least entertaining for those who get pumped for watching hasty gunfights and explosions go off in the White House (take Roland Emmerich's 'Independence Day' for example). This patriotic action thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, the master behind the acclaimed 'Training Day' and 'Shooter', sets viewers in a pulse-pounding shoot-em-up ""man vs. terrorist"" extravaganza, while borrowing familiar elements of the 'Die Hard' franchise; but perhaps without the humor and charisma of Bruce Willis' John McClane. This film stars Gerard Butler as Mike Banning, a former secret service agent for President Benjamin Asher (played by Aaron Eckhart) who reassigned from position after a tragic event left him emotionally scarred. Now he works for at a desk for the United States Department of Treasury. What starts off as a normal day turns horribly wrong when a fleet of North Korean fighter pilots lead by terrorist Kang Yeonsak (played by Rick Yune) launch an assault on the White House. With President Asher and many other government officials taken hostage, it is up to Banning with the help of House Speaker Allan Trumbull (played by Morgan Freeman) and Director of Secret Service Lynne Jacobs (played by Angela Bassett) through communication via earpiece to save them.An attack on the White House and the destruction of the national monument certainly feels a climatic sequence from a Roland Emmerich movie. But no need to worry, there is an entertaining, if unoriginal plot to be handed here; and not without an amazing plethora of special effects to feed the eyes of action flick junkies. The opening minutes of the North Korean guerilla attack on the White House are incredibly violent and do very little to hold back when sprouting plenty of blood splattering enough to hence an R-rating, and the bloodshed doesn't stop there. The action continues on the lead character's hunt for the ruthless Korean terrorist who has the President and many others taken hostage at gunpoint, as he (Gerard Butler) roams the dark halls through the White House taken out each gunman one by one; and the scenes achieve the blessings of solid cinematography by Conrad W. Hall rather than incoherent shaky cam that far too many action films are infamous for. Though the pacing eventually slows down a bit during the final half-hour, the action and occasional suspense do just enough to keep the film on its feet. Gerard Butler, an actor with a rather rough filmography of the past several years, breaths plenty of life and humanity as lead character Mike Banning. Though he may not obtain the same charismatic persona as John McClane, he nonetheless fits the bill. Rick Yune doesn't quite make a memorable villain either, but to say the least he does his best.Olympus Has Fallen is a pulse-pounding action thriller that though lack novelty, stands strong as an entertaining action popcorn flick with solid special effects and an surprisingly rewarding role by Gerard Butler. This movie is not something I would count on going down as a classic in the genre, but one to enjoy without feeling the need of a rich original action flick.",Olympus Has Fallen
98,leftbanker-1,As Bad As It Gets,1,24 April 2018,"First of all, any film that has a scene in which someone screams, ""Nnnnnoooooooo!"" automatically rates 1 star and has to work its way up from the cliché outhouse pit. Another cliché is opening scenes in which the characters are showed as the perfectly happy familial unit-something that can just be taken for granted and never makes good screen time. Another cliché common in action movie hogwash is the completely over-the-top and bombastic soundtrack.Flashbacks of the trauma scene? We got'em here! I guess that subtlety isn't a valued commodity in this sort of film.All of this corn came before the do-do hits the F-A-N.Second of all, any film with Morgan Freeman rates a 10. He could raise a German scat porn video to respectability. He enters in the first act so now the film is at 5. Where will it go from here?Huge amount of blood and gore, that's where. A conservative body count in the initial attack: 500 to 1,000. Cartoonish, very, very cartoonish.And then it gets, really, really stupid.In the initial shoot-out at the White House, why wouldn't the hero bend over and pick up a better weapon from one of the dozens of people he killed? How many clips does he take to work with him at his office? Do the film makers think we can't count?Agents keep pouring out of the front of the White House in the midst of 50. cal fire?

99,antoniotierno,unnecessary story,5,21 April 2013,"The spectacle is astounding, though extremely unlikely. Action sequences, filmed at a White House reconstruction, show how to build something exciting, however preposterous. There's no serious interest or intent in this story, only huge effects and nothing else, with a film ending grotesque and sentimental at the same time. It's about reactionary fantasy, a decent cast but frankly nothing else. A somehow ludicrous action movie, very loud, violent, and (maybe too much) patriotic, that looks a bit like a Die Hard film but lacks the wit, humor and adrenaline that made that a classic Hollywood production. It has to be said that there is too much patriotism and reductive politics over here, so the result is certainly disappointing.",Olympus Has Fallen

Olympus Has Fallen falls into this category. It had all ingredients to be a perfect entertainment but loose screenplay diverts your attention and the film falls flat on face.Olympus Has Fallen tells the story of former bodyguard , played by Gerald Butler, to the US president who is trapped inside the White House and must fight his way out to save the president from being executed by Korean terrorist.From the director of Training Day , Shooter , Tears of the Sun - Antonio Fuqua gives you Olympus Has Fallen which had plays typical good vs evil combat which had nothing new to offer despite boasting off such a heavy duty star cast Morgan Freeman , Gerald Butler and Aoron Eckhart. The movie starts off well with an accident killing the first lady for which Butler blames himself. Few scenes belong to some cool action scenes blowing away cars and helicopter. However , the thought which came to mind was it that easy to enter alien country's aerospace and start attacking ? Moving on , film pitches some good intense scenes and with Butler entering the scene and taking out tough guy raises the eyeball. The climax was less impacting compared to Fuqua's previous works. The direction is good but it the over the top writing which plays the spoil sports. Cinematography is good along with good dialogues. Editing is crispy. It is Gerald Butler all the way stealing the limelight right from the beginning.

But despite Freeman's prominent position on the cover artwork, which was no doubt done intentionally to draw in viewers, his role is no more than a supportive one, with Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart, two actors I am far less enthusiastic about, in the lead roles.Truth is, unless you are naive like me and drawn in by an well-produced trailer and some colourful cover artwork featuring your favourite actor, you'll know what you're getting before the movie even starts - more brainless, plotless, action-obsessed, generic Hollywood trash. It was so obvious, but some of us were dumb enough to take the bait and watch it anyway.I suppose if you watch this without thinking about the sheer absurdity and unoriginality of everything that is happening on-screen, and just take the action at face value, there is some entertainment to be had.

105,classicalsteve,Mediocre and Senselessly Violent Action Flick thats Essentially Die Hard in the White House,3,2 December 2013,"I found little about this film entertaining or even redemptive. Its essentially an over-top shoot-em-up flick with moments of such gratuitous violence that I began to wonder why in the world I was watching it. The plot is essentially like that of the original Die Hard film. Instead of a multi-national corporation, the victims are the White House, and the hostages include the President, the Secretary of State and the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.The movie parallels the original Die Hard not just in terms of plot but also in many scenes. In the original Die Hard, the baddies were Germans. In this offering they are North Koreans. The baddies infiltrate the White House using such state of the art equipment and finesse that anyone in charge of some kind of military operation would be highly envious. In about the time it takes to order a hamburger and shake from your favorite fast food restaurant, the North Koreans have brought the White House to its knees and are holding the top brass hostage. And why? They want the US's nuclear launch codes to start World War III.Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, a sort of John McClaine-like Secret Service Agent who just happened to be removed from the White House when all the fun begins. He then infiltrates the battered White House, moving among the Oval Office and other areas which appear like the remnants of a place long since abandoned centuries earlier. The film is mostly about him, in true John McClaine-like fashion, trying to free the hostages and doing to the baddies what was done to the White House. His contact is the Speaker of the House, played by Morgan Freeman, and other members of the government who were luckily not at the White House when it became the equivalent of a building in a Post-Apocalyptic world. In a particularly vicious scene, the Secretary of Defense, played by Mellissa Leo, is beaten to a pulp by the baddies.Overall a horrid movie with so much gratuitous violence that some scenes I just didn't want to watch. If you like pure shoot-em-up where no less then 679 people get killed or hurt, this is certainly the film for you. The original Die Hard film certainly had violence, but it also had plot, pacing, and a certain amount of character development. There are even moments of humor. This film is humorless, character-less, and has no sense of pace or timing. Just lots and lots of heads and bodies being blown to bits.",Olympus Has Fallen
106,carbuff,Takes a lot of effort to put into words how bad this movie is.,1,2 May 2015,"Yeah, I got halfway. Yeah, it's dumb as hell. I'd say that the screenplay was likely written by some rudimentary AI software running on an ancient low-end refurbished laptop, except that it might have been a graphing calculator. Calling this film formulaic is demeaning to formulas. The trailer showed a counterfeit C-130 Gunship in action, so I had to at least look. Ground attack aircraft attract me like a moth to a flame. If A-10s were on the bill too, I wouldn't have stopped and my suffering would've been further prolonged. I'm an addict and I need help. Like the old ""How many jellybeans in the jar?"" contest, this film needs something similar for how many people die in the first 20 minutes. To keep guesses on the finite side of infinite, only deaths from gunfire will count. Minimally,the idiotic bloodbath kicking off our two hours of viewing pleasure must have caused a severe nationwide shortage of blanks, so, until the Tinseltown Armory was restocked, countless deplorable chick flicks and Adam Sandler vehicles must have been made out of sheer necessity. The crumbling Washington Monument obviously symbolized temporary American dysfunction, and, in the closing scenes, I expect it was, um, re-erected. Very unrealistically, there were Secret Service agents everywhere, yet an appalling lack of drugs, alcohol, or Columbian prostitutes. What's up with that?Essentially, this movie comes down to man-child Gerard Butler together with random actual child-child versus a small highly-trained army seemingly fielding nearly every conceivable modern lethal weapon. Sorry, my heart simply couldn't take the suspense. Most likely our two fearless heroes valiantly resist and fight this impossibly overwhelming force right up to bitter end, ultimately and inevitably succumbing in blazing glory to a cruel, merciless hail of bullets along the lines of ""Little Big Horn"", ""The Alamo"", or ""Butch Cassidy"" (tossing out a few perfect F.U. quips through gritted teeth as they bleed out and ascend to heaven), but your guess is as good as mine.",Olympus Has Fallen

They've got themselves a hit. Here's how the process probably went with Olympus Has Fallen.PREMISE: The White HouseTHREAT: North KoreansRANSOM: Military Withdrawal HERO: Ex Special AgentYou see how simple it is? Just like how they develop the jokes on Family Guy... with manatees and balls (just kidding, Fox lawyers). Just think of all the hours that might have been saved by adopting this method, and how no-one would ever have to spend ages putting actual effort into developing a screenplay ever again. GENIUS.Aside from unlikely story lines though, how does the rest of the movie hold up? Pretty damn good. It may stick to a rigid format... there are shades of everything from 'Die Hard' to 'Cliffhanger' here... but it's impossible to criticise when you're having this much fun. The opening battle, between a state-of-the-art jet and half of Washington's military, is especially stirring... and sets the tone of what is to follow.When people get shot, you feel the impact. When they get beaten up, every blow reverberates through the screen. The word 'uncompromising' springs to mind... it's nice to see a juicy thriller which doesn't stint on the violence to attract a wider audience. The cast know what they're doing too.. Gerard Butler is a hero everyman we can all root for, Rick Yune plays a particularly despicable bad guy and if your president and his vice are indisposed, who better to turn to than the dulcet tones of one Morgan Freeman?

If you can stand the violence presented in it, you will certainly enjoy this one, especially with Gerard Butler as protagonist and Morgan Freeman as president replacement. Although I really liked this one, it disappointed me with its finale, in which Mike doesn't receive anything for his courage, heroism and for saving the whole situation all by himself.

More importantly, the action sequences were shot with great precision.super-small, meaningless spoiler coming.The plan far-fetched? Yes, but each action sequence is put together with such chronological accuracy, that it helps us forget how unlikely this scenario would be. THe attack on the White House is swift, and appears highly-coordinated! The director did everything and more to make this 'unlikely' scenario pop-off the screen with superb editing and timing.

110,ofpsmith,I was surprised.,8,18 May 2014,"When I saw this movie I thought it was going to be just another mindless action flick. Well, I was kind of right. But I still found it to be a really good film. The action was really fun, I think Morgan Freeman did his usual good job, and the North Koreans make the best bad guys. Read the news about them and you'll see what I mean. The plot is that President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckert) has been kidnapped by North Korean terrorists. The plot for the attack was very laid out and carefully planned. First two North Korean Airmen would fly a USAF C-130 Hercules and attack Washington DC. When it was shot down by an F-22 Raptor. The rest of the North Koreans, who were in disguise as Chinese tourists and Chines laborers would break into the White House and catch Asher. The leader Kang (Rick Yune)was in disguise as the South Korean president's security agent. After killing the South Korean president he took the Asher hostage as well as his cabinet members. The only Secret Service Agent in the White House was Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). Mike is in touch with White House speaker Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) who is the acting president. Mike has to get past the North Koreans and retain the president. I think the movie was very good but it has flaws nonetheless. There were many factual errors. For example the United States Air Force would never let a C-130 go into enemy hands. Also US Army officers do not wear their marksmanship medals. But mostly the occurrence of a terrorist attack like this is extremely rare because after an air strike all tourists by the White House would be made to leave.

112,JohnRayPeterson,This ought to have played at the summer blockbuster peak; thank god for Blue Ray releases,7,6 July 2013,"This is the 6th movie directed by Antoine Fuqua I've seen and I'm very much looking forward to the one that is currently being filmed, The Equalizer, having been a fan of the TV series. When Fuqua directed his second feature film, The Replacement Killers, he showed us what he could do: great action thriller, at least for Hollywood type action thrillers. The genre always has the good guys win in the end; I think it's a rule or something. Anyway, it takes nothing away from the captivating flow Fuqua delivers so well.We are not annoyed by stupid clichés and one-liners that have no punch or distract from the plot in this movie. It's all about making you feel it's real and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Gerald Butler was an excellent choice for the key protagonist's role of Mike Banning, as was Rick Yune in that of the foe. Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart and Dylan McDermott complete the main supporting roles. Other fine actors such as Robert Foster, Finley Jacobson and Ashley Judd round off the others you will remember.We are introduced rather intelligently to Mike Banning at the beginning of the movie when we see him at the worst moment of his career, the one that costs him the disfavor of the president. Speaking of the role of president, I've been a fan of Aaron Eckhart since the movie Suspect Zero and have not looked back. This sub-plot involving Eckhart and Butler contributes an element we dearly need in action thrillers, one that has to do with the psychology of the characters. Butler was made for these kinds of roles, just think of the movies 300, Gamer, Law Abiding Citizen and Coriolanus. The sub-plot of which I speak even makes the ending sweeter, but I'll say no more.Would you believe a story that involves the taking of the White House? You will here, and I did not think I could, suspension of disbelief notwithstanding. If you want to enjoy a summer blockbuster in the comfort of your home, get this movie.",Olympus Has Fallen
113,Likes_Ninjas90,You can only hope that the people watching this mindless bloodbath will see it for how ridiculous and infantile it is,2,16 April 2013,"Modern cinema revels so frequently in destruction and chaos that it is extraordinary that a film as unambitious and appalling as Olympus Has Fallen can surprise you in the way that it fetishises big guns, explosions, high body counts and the demolition of various American monuments. Mindless blockbusters like this sell to teenage boys on the promise of more explosions and less brains. This is more disturbing considering how long the film lingers over people blown to bits and buildings destroyed. Derivative and poorly scripted, Olympus Has Fallen will put you to sleep with its sluggish pacing and relentlessly dull action scenes, or make your skin crawl with its chest-beating and laughable celebration of all things born in good old USA. The director was Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter), who has a long history as a music video artist. He directed the music video for the song Gangsta's Paradise by rapper Coolio and worked with Prince and Stevie Wonder too. Here he has paired with novice screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikit to make a rip-off of the popular Clint Eastwood vehicle In the Line of Fire. Eastwood played an ageing secret service agent, whose inner demon was that he failed to save John F. Kennedy, and a lunatic stalking him was going to murder the new President. The film excelled because of the limited physicality of its central character and the suggestion of murder instead of outright gunfire. Where's the tension in Olympus when the main character is bulletproof, fall proof and endlessly resourceful, able to pummel goons with a statue of Honest Abe? Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is a Secret Service guard of the American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), who is devastated when he fails to save the President's wife in a car accident. Eighteen months later, Mike is now working in the Treasury Department near the White House. Asher is holding a meeting with the President of South Korea, but they are ambushed by Korean soldiers and a traitorous secret service officer and taken hostage in the underground bunker of the White House. North Korean terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) demands that the President's staff (including Melissa Leo) handover the three codes to the USA's nuclear weapons and withdraw their soldiers from the DMZ area. Mike tries to infiltrate the building, rescue Asher's son Connor (Finley Jacobsen) and then the President. He conferences with acting President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), and assures his partner Leah (Radha Mitchell) of his wellbeing. A potentially chilling and timely premise of the threat of North Korea is handled amateurishly by Fuqua. The opening scenes between Asher and his son in Camp David substitute characterisation for cheery mawkishness, and the bombastic, over the top attack on the White House lacks important narrative details. Who knew that it was so comfortable to enter US airspace with fighter-bombers? I found the fear mongering and jingoism in this overlong sequence as repelling as the body count. Asian terrorists pop out of nowhere, either wearing suicide bombs or firing rocket launchers. Few films in recent memory have been as profoundly racist and geocentric as this.The action sequences that follow hinge on cheap patriotic sentiment, including an unintentionally comical image of an American flag falling in slow motion, but without any deeper themes or meaning, they become boring and repetitive. The violence is incredibly sadistic, including one unwatchable beating, or blurred because of the incoherence of Fuqua's overwrought hand-held cameras and dim lighting. One interesting technical feat was that the film was shot in Louisiana not Washington and 1300 special effects shots, along with sets, were used to recreate the White House and other stunts. However, it is still disturbing that the people involved with this dreck view it seriously and as ideologically significant. In an interview Gerard Butler, who also produced the film, endorsed its overt patriotism: ""You come out of there with so much patriotism and you feel inspired because really at the end of the day the essence of the story, it's a hero's journey."" Patriotism is not an appropriate excuse for demonising other cultures and working as hard as possible to inflate people's fears through post-9/11 jingoism. Films are often divorced from responsibility because they are fictional but where do we draw the line?

Butler portrays a disgraced secret service agent, who finds himself being the only person left to stop a terrorist takeover of the White House. It's a simple premise, and it's one that the filmmakers adequately find the tension of the hypothetical scenario and make it feel real. The film never traipses into farce, like so many action movies are want to do. Nothing ever occurs in this film that seemed completely impossible to me, and that's why this film works. Could it have used a few jokes here and there? Sure. Would I have preferred a few more memorable fight scenes? Yeah, but at the end of the day, if you're looking for an action/thriller that is smartly made, surprisingly emotional, and extremely tense, you don't have to look any further than Olympus Has Fallen.I give Olympus Has Fallen a 9 out of 10!",Olympus Has Fallen
116,Imdbidia,"Fallen, definitely fallen",5,9 February 2017,"One knows what to expect from action movies like this. That is why one goes to the cinema to watch them or turns the TV on. It doesn't matter that they are made as by a cookie cutter, that they have clichéd (and contrived) themes, characters and images. But they are fun entertaining movies most of the time. Something to watch and forget forever, as well. I found Olympus Has Fallen's production and action scenes very good, as well as the wardrobe, cinematography and atmosphere. That is the best part of the film. I wasn't expecting Oscar-quality performances, for sure, but the fact that Freeman and Basset are there, was something exciting a priori. Unfortunately, the acting was not good, except for some of the supporting actors: Basset as the Secret Service director, Leo as the Secretary of Defense, Yung as the ruthless terrorist, Mitchel as the hero's wife, and Judd in her almost-cameo as the President's wife. I understand that actors need to eat and sometimes they are part of a film to do just that, but it is a pain seeing Freeman's talent wasted playing the same role over and over again, and without any conviction in this film. It is also painful seeing Buttler's career going down through a sink-hole playing a role that he doesn't believe in. Eckhart, unfortunately, wasn't much better either. On the other hand, the script and dialogues are very simplistic so one cannot blame them entirely.I expect an action film like this to be violent, for sure. But there is an excess of gory stuff and violence, which I don't think was necessary to improve the movie. At times, the movie felt as one of those role video-games in which one plays the role of an elite-corps soldier who has to rescue somebody going through enemy territory blowing people's brains out.The movie is not terrible but not good either. It is entertaining for sure, but not overly so either.",Olympus Has Fallen
117,Laakbaar,Attack on the White House,7,8 May 2013,"This is a fast-paced action movie laden with shootouts and military hardware. It is oriented towards those who buy into American ideology and iconography, or at least are willing to turn off their cynicism for two hours.I thought Gerard Butler was great as the die-hard secret-service agent looking to do his duty and recover his tarnished reputation. Sure he's good with kids and looks great in a suit, but he's also tough enough to stab traitors in the brain. What's not to love? Butler is an actor who oozes masculine competence, albeit in a slightly offbeat way. It's to his credit that he can carry a movie like this.His almost superhuman skills were far-fetched. OK, he wasn't an ordinary secret service agent. But why was he so incredible, when the others were so inept? I guess we'll have to wait for the sequel to find out.The shock and awe in this movie is based on seeing the White House turned into a shooting gallery and terrorist headquarters, and seeing it get blown up in a variety of ways. I thought the attack was realistic enough, although it did seem surprisingly easy. I'm sure the people really involved in protecting the president and the US groaned at many of the scenes. I haven't googled it, but I imagine someone, somewhere, has explained in detail why this attack wouldn't work in real life.What struck me the most was that this movie seems to reflect some deep American fear of vulnerability to terrorism. I suppose it's actually a metaphor for the fear of losing hegemony. Olympus has fallen. Or maybe it reflects American fear of retaliation. I particularly relished the scene where Butler crushes the terrorist's head with a bust of Abraham Lincoln. Talk about symbolism.It's difficult for a non-American like myself to empathise with the angst arising from the death of a president or the destruction of the White House. Not to mention the Washington Monument cut in half, or a bullet-holed American flag fluttering to the ground. Americans invest a lot of meaning into symbols like this. This movie is entirely predicated on it. However, America is much more than these things. The movie went too far. The voice over at the end was too much.There were a few plot holes, but the only plot device that seemed seriously unrealistic to me was the president's orders to release the codes. What he should have ordered them to do was to die with the codes, or even to kill themselves. It doesn't make sense for him to order them to release the codes to save their lives, because Kang would have tortured them later in front of him anyway.And it is still not clear to me how Kang got the third code. That flew by me somehow.Not too much thought was put into the terrorists this time around, but then I suppose any vague, vile terrorist group will serve the purpose in a red, white and blue movie like this. What do the South Koreans think of it all? I'm sure they're not happy.Allow me to add that Morgan Freeman is in a lot of movies lately. I love him, but he's sort of over-exposed, don't you think? I think this film is worth about 7.5 but I'm going to round it down because of the over-the-top jingoism and the fact that it's not really a movie for adults.",Olympus Has Fallen
118,cinematic_aficionado,offensive to anyone with some rational faculties left in them,3,29 April 2013,"The obsession of American with North Korea continues. Following the horrid ""Dawn of war"" this film takes us into White House where it is taken over by a bunch of North Koreans who threaten to kill the president unless they get something in return.Since we do know that if such scenario were to ever materialise, the president would have been useless to them since all his access codes would have automatically been changed and thus their efforts futile. Therefore there is no need to try and kidnap the president and most certainly not in the world's most guarded residence.Aside from a story that is plain daft, it actually becomes offending to the audience's mind (those that have some mind left) they way it was executed, since ti shows a group of solders effectively taking control of the White House and the US government.A great film for the mind numbed.",Olympus Has Fallen
119,billygoat1071,Contemporary Thrills,7,12 April 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen is basically a rip-off of Die Hard but with a larger scale and higher stakes. The idea sounds preposterous nonetheless, but the film's only ambition is to be over the top thrilling. As a mindless blockbuster, it's thoroughly entertaining, thanks to its fine direction and well-driven suspense. It's still unavoidably dumb and unoriginal, but the film possesses what a true action movie needs. There are still better action films out there, but because of our recent ones that sucks out the enjoyment by its pretension and we do not get to see some real fun often in blockbusters, I think Olympus Has Fallen is worth a watch.It's amazing how a band of ricers overpowers United States. They have planes, huge weapons, skilled hackers, and professional fighters that could easily defeat the powerful nation. The American government here is so incompetent, even an army of Asian street goons killed almost every ""highly trained"" agent in the building. It gets more ridiculous so on. We can accept it as an overly dumb piece of action as long as it's compellingly fun. The biggest problem however is the main character. He doesn't have the charisma that made this kind of hero memorable. Gerard Butler still gives a little heart and enthusiasm to the character, but he's far from John McClane cool. The villain here is no Gruber either. Rick Yune plays the role quite campy but that's just it.Putting the weak parts aside, the film is still exciting. There's no pretension on the threats that was displayed. It's simply just intense destruction and violence. The actions scenes are well directed and serves a lot of compelling thrills. Since it wants to be Die Hard, the dated special effects and the music score could make the audience feel like this film was released in the eighties but that's fine I guess. They want to go to the basic action anyway. Just turn off your brain and deal with its absurdity.Olympus Has Fallen is not going to be any memorable, but it pleasures for those who wants to see some nerve shattering explosions and genuinely exciting action. It feels like it belongs to Luc Besson's recent set of action films like Lockout and From Paris with Love. It's not a classic nor smart but it really knows how to have fun. This film may also payback for the ones who were frustrated by A Good Day To Die Hard. Olympus Has Fallen is almost just a typical afternoon entertainment if it weren't for its solid craft and entertainment quality, but if you are looking for something intellectual and realistic then you will be in trouble.",Olympus Has Fallen

Because it reminded me of those movies from back in the day where you weren't always politically correct. AND you just enjoyed watching a wonderful unapologetic terrorism movie. Does it have a message? Possibly. It's what people take from it. Reading from responses, the Korean conflict is very polarizing. Me, I went to eat some popcorn and watch good ol' movie justice come to life. What else did I like about the movie...oh...of course you know the ending of this movie, BUT, it's a really fun ride. Just relax and let that part of your brain that doesn't allow this much escapism go.",Olympus Has Fallen
121,Rickting,Whatever,6,3 February 2014,"I always love a good action film and this is pretty much Die Hard in the White House, so it's similar to what is pretty much the best action movie of all time. This is one of 2 Die Hard in the White House films from 2013, the other being White House Down. It can be said pretty safely this is the better of the 2. This is a deeply flawed movie you'll forget after a few days (True story) but it provides agreeable Friday night fare and nothing more. The film's villains are North Koreans, and the main villain is genuinely alarming and his plan to devastate the United States adds tension to the film. You wouldn't expect it, but Antoine Fuqua directs the film in a tense manner and however little you care you're often on the edge of your seat. The opening attack on the White House is extremely intense and a real slap in the face. Although the film fails to reach that momentum again, resorting instead to Butler beating people up in darkened corridors and outrunning flaming helicopters, but thanks to the tense direction it is more entertaining. It's certainly not the finest hour for any of the 3 leads, but they all do their best and Gerard Butler brings unexpected grit and intensity to his role. For action fans who prefer things like the Bourne films, this will probably be your thing.The main problem with the film is its failure to reconcile its grit and realism with its B movie origins. This is a pretty stupid plot and needs humour to be more fun, but for some reason the film is full of seriousness and grit and moves with about as much happiness as a Twilight vampire. The film takes itself too seriously and at times becomes unpleasant to watch, while as can be expected, the writers clearly used a cliché book to write it. The film peaked far too early with the White House attack and throughout you might as well be a Divination professor since you can see everything that's going to happen before it has happened. The CGI isn't as bad as in White House Down, but there are some stupid looking explosions. This is a mixed bag overall, with some intensity and good acting but it lacks fun a lot of the time and is totally cowardly in the way of actually doing anything new or interesting. A fun Friday night movie. Nothing more.6/10",Olympus Has Fallen
122,christophe92300,Is this a parody ?,2,25 July 2013,"If Antoine Fuqua wanted to make a more cliché movie, he couldn't, Olympus Has Fallen gathering absolutely all the stereotypes of the Hollywood action movie.The script has been seen over and over again, is predictable from start to finish and offers no surprise or twist whatsoever: a secluded group in a confined environment saved by a solitary hero... now that is original. The dialogues are cheesier one from another, the score based on heavy violons is omnipresent and the special effects pretty average. Every cliché goes through it and we are under the impression to see, at best, a bad TV film, at worst, a parody of an action movie.Hard to understand how recognized actors like Aaron Eckhart or Morgan Freeman were convinced by such a weak project.",Olympus Has Fallen
123,TheSquiss,Explosive fun & a plot as hole-ridden as the White House plasterwork.,5,1 May 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen is a gung-ho, testosterone over-dosed, kill-every-last-mofo rampage and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. But director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) hasn't served up a teeth-grindingly horrible companion piece to Act of Valor. It's more Clear and Present Danger with great big clanging balls and a budget to put the fear of God into anyone considering such an attack on Washington.Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is President Asher's (Aaron Eckhart) top Presidential guard, sparring partner in the ring and paid buddy to his son. Then, one dark and stormy night he pulls the President from a car as it tumbles from a bridge into the abyss, leaving the First Lady to fall to her death. Everybody knows Banning had no time and no choice, but who wants to spend every day with the man who let his wife die? Fast forward a couple of years and Banning is little more than a Secret Service grunt working in the shadow of the White House when terrorist Kang (Rick Yune) unleashes the mother of all terrorist attacks on the house, leaving Banning the last man standing and the only link the Secret Service has on the inside.Before Fuqua declares war on the White House, he ramps up the tension. We already know from the trailer that the first lady dies, but it doesn't stop us clenching our toes and bum cheeks as we will, in vain, the car away from the precipice before Fuqua ramps up the action sharply. In 1996, Independence Day gave us the most spectacular demolition of the White House we'd seen. This, however, is without doubt the most severe, emphatic destruction of the White House. No wall is left unscarred by bullets and shrapnel, few floors remain free of blood and brains, heck, half of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue disappears by the time we reach the closing credits! And how much fun does Fuqua have doing it? Probably even more than we have watching. Don't misconstrue that as an insult: it isn't. Olympus Has Fallen delivers the action, it entertains, it serves up the blood and explosions, but it has a leading man with as many facial expressions as Jason Statham and just the barest whisper of a foot in reality. If the White House could fall this easily, surely somebody would have done it by now. I'm not going to outline the flaws, just switch off your brain, enjoy the noise and spectacle and try not to wonder how Banning finds the time to call his wife when the clock is ticking and executions edging closer.Butler has dabbled in 'serious' acting (cringe at Phantom of the Opera, weep at Machine Gun Preacher) but seems to have accepted his forte is brawn. He struts, he grunts, he pours out his dialogue and he kills everything in his way to saving the President. We know he has a softer side because Asher's son thinks the world of him but it's an irrelevant strand of the story that serves only to round his character. The conclusion of their joint character arc is almost pointless and does little for the story. Perhaps Fuqua cut it because child out-acted man.Melissa Leo, as Secretary of Defense Ruth McMillan, earns top marks in the performance stakes here, proving yet again what a dependable and chameleon-like performer she is, though she is probably doomed to be another 'that actress' for many cinema-goers. McMillan is such a strong character (she'd have to be to land her role in the government) that when her own fear surfaces, in spite of her resolve, it makes our own spines tingle; how would I cope? Yune, in his highest profile role since Die Another Day, relishes his villainy without descending into pantomime territory but never really gets under our skin. Perhaps that is simply because we understand without question that he can't possibly win and so we view him as an impudent, but ultimately impotent, bad boy.Ashley Judd, though sincere as the First Lady, barely has time to sparkle as the resident eye candy before being dispatched to the great beyond. Angela Bassett fares better as Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs and manages to bring expectation and fear to the table but Olympus Has Fallen is undeniably a boy's film with the most fun handed out to the male stars.Though he is a supporting actor in this, Morgan Freeman has enough time to tinker with nastiness as Speaker Trumbull, before settling into a more recognizable presidential-type role. Morgan is rarely anything other than dependable but this isn't a film about character depths and so he isn't given much opportunity to delve and the possible spark between Banning and Trumbull that is set up in an early conversation is never revisited.I shouldn't be disappointed. I knew what to expect going into Olympus Has Fallen (i.e. nothing approaching reasonable logic) and mostly I wasn't disappointed. What I wasn't expecting was the humour, though I suspect it was entirely unintentional and will be missed by all but the most discerning American audiences. The British audience I watched this with, however, wasn't quite as reverential and, when we reached the inevitable 'America is great; God bless America' monologue, a ripple of giggles added a more realistic soundtrack to the closing scenes. When will Hollywood learn the art of self-deprecation? I'll end with a question to ponder: Olympus Has Fallen is rated 15. The expletives are liberally sprinkled throughout while the violence is extreme as brains splatter bloodily across walls and knives penetrate heads gruesomely. Fuqua never shies away from the severity of the violence and neither that nor the language is out of place in such a film. But what more does a film need to offer in order to warrant an 18 (NC-17 in the USA) certificate?

124,RevRonster,Not a bad action film...,6,8 August 2013,"There's no doubt this film has some issues but they weren't enough to get me to give up on this film.I really liked what Antoine Fuqua did with the action as he made it less about shooting generic baddies down like a video game and made much of it pretty horrendous to watch and made it feel gritty and real--much like his other works. Finally, I really liked Rick Yune as the villain; I thought he was cold, calculating and devious.However, the other performances in this film weren't as good. Some, like Gerard Butler, were kinda underwhelming and others, like Morgan Freeman, were laying it on a little heavy--but never to the point it took me out of the movie.Finally, the film has a tendency to drag in spots (mainly towards the end) but, like the performances, this wasn't a deal breaker. Overall, the film isn't the best action film I've but it's far from the worst.",Olympus Has Fallen
125,davidgee,Fast and furious,7,27 April 2013,"The critics have done a hatchet job on this: ""DIE HARD at the White House."" What's wrong with that as the premise for a movie? North Korean terrorists take the US President hostage - how topical and timely is that, for God's sake!OK, the plot could have been - and possibly was - knocked up in week one of a Screen writing-For-Beginners course. The bad guys drop like flies, but Mike/Gerard goes on relentlessly, battered and bruised but unstoppable (he doesn't even get his vest dirty!). Butler and Eckhart are a pair of handsome hunks, but the thin script and non-stop shoot- outs give them little opportunity to lift their characters out of the cardboard cut-out category. Morgan Freeman gets another thankless role.This is not as good as any of the first three DIE HARD movies or the early series of 24 on TV, but it's no worse (and perhaps a bit better) than Bruce Willis's fifth outing as John McClane (and Jack Bauer went a little flat in the later series).

126,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Bronze Star,6,6 May 2013,"Beginning with a successful yet ultimately tragic rescue of the President of the United States, resulting in the death of his wife into an icy lake, his number one Secret Service agent and chief decision maker Mike Banning is laying low in Washington, sadly remembering the good old days. Meanwhile President Asher, played by Aaron Eckhart, has an important meeting about North Korea and his young son misses mom, and even more so, Gerard Butler's Manning, who was sort of a big brother and/or cool uncle through the years.The word Olympus refers to the White House, and with a blasting of jet planes soaring through the blue skies of Washington D.C., followed by nefarious terrorist ground troops moving in, the White House is penetrated while the Prez himself, along with his Veep and a few others, go down to a secret safe room – which doesn't remain secret or safe for long.This initial all-out attack/invasion, the second action sequence following the first lady's demise, is both exciting and involving, without the use of too many shaky cameras. The important thing, though, is that Banning (Butler) manages to get inside the now dilapidated White House interior. All the while, a villainous Korean ""mastermind"" named Kang has the President hostage, blowing away most of his important underlings to prove he means business. All the bombastic acrobatics aside, with violence bordering on a gratuitous level and sporadic cuts to a round table emergency session (which includes Morgan Freeman's Secretary of State), the good stuff has Butler making edgy ground throughout the White House, taking out the bad guys and attempting to rescue the President's son.Heck, even a sweaty one-on-one fistfight against the main villain trumps the last minute attempt to avert an all-out nuclear war, proving that a good old fashion muscular hero is worth his weight in action genre gold, or in this case, solid bronze.",Olympus Has Fallen

It is up to one cop who is inside the White House to save the day.It is a typical action film. There are gun fights, fist fights and explosions. There is nothing original about this movie at all. The whole film has been seen a million times before, but that does not make it bad. I really enjoyed this, even though it really is just a rip off of Die Hard.The movie stars Gerard Butler. I like Gerard. He is a great actor who seems to be able to do any kind of acting that he decides to do. He is good in comedies, musicals, action and drama. He does a good job in this too. He plays the cop that has to save the day. He knows how to fight which is great. He kicked some serious butt! The president was played by Aaron Eckhart. I don't mind him, but I can't help but see him as Harvey ""Two-Face"" Dent. It's my own fault. I have seen The Dark Knight so many times that he has been typecast in my own mind. But he did a decent job in this. He played a victim quite well. And yes Morgan Freeman is in it is it me or is Morgan in almost everything these days? He is a fantastic actor and it is always good to see him on screen, but he must be nonstop working. Other cast members were Dylan McDermott & Angela Bassett. Dylan was probably the worst actor of them all I don't want to give any spoilers, but as soon as I saw him, the way he was gave the whole story away. He made it very predictable. It is a shame because I like him especially in American Horror Story.The action was good, the story was a rip off but has proved to be a good story, and the casting was good. The movie is very smooth running and there are no point in it at all where I was bored or wanted the film to hurry up.

131,Al_The_Strange,Olympus Has Fallen review,8,21 April 2013,"This is that movie you can easily write off as ""Die Hard in the White House."" In fact, this is probably what the last couple of Die Hard films should have been. Olympus Has Fallen follows the exact same plot formula established in the first Die Hard, and since used in numerous action flicks like Under Siege and Air Force One.You know the story: you start off seeing how the main character gets to the lowly position he's in, while everybody else goes about their daily business. Then, BAM! Bad guys create a huge crisis situation, and it's up to the hero to save the day against all odds. Simple and formulaic. With the premise of a rogue Korean paramilitary group taking over the White House, the film is also highly exaggerated, and will likely push the boundaries of what's believable and realistic. Chances are that you'll read this, or see the trailer, and make up your own mind about whether this is awesome, or just derivative bull.If nothing else, Olympus Has Fallen has a ton of action. Aside from the opening scenes, which establish some necessary character-building points, the action hits early in the film with sudden and explosive force. It's actually pretty scary to watch all the mass carnage raining down on DC. Lots of explosions, lots of loud gunfights, lots of gnarly knife fights, and huge helpings of suspense ensue.Most of the story is already described above. It may not be anything special, but I applaud it for sticking with the fundamentals. Characters are built up well enough by action movie standards. What makes the story worthwhile will be the sheer amount of conflict and stakes that are raised; absurd, perhaps, but definitely gripping. The film also tries hard to pull on some patriotic heartstrings; such overtones will be a hit-or-a-miss with audiences.This film has okay photography; many shots will appear dark and hazed-out, while some of the fights use some annoying shaky-camera moves. Editing is not bad though. Acting is serviceable; Gerald Butler plays the role of a tough burdened hero really well, and is awesome to watch. Writing is serviceable as well. This production uses okay sets, props, and costumes, but also sports some weak special effects. Music has its moments.I expect most audiences will find this film too absurd, overblown, derivative, shallow, and pushy. Regardless, I loved the film for tapping into all the same driving forces that makes my other favorite action movies so great. If you enjoy films like Air Force One, The Rock, the Die Hard series, either of the Under Siege movies, or anything like that, then this one should be right up your alley too.4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",Olympus Has Fallen

134,lagudafuad,Suspend reason to enjoy this film,6,31 March 2013,"The movie is very very bogus, but that aside I actually liked it. The whole one man army things is one thing that sometimes Hollywood over plays and no movie has been able to get near it like Die Hard 1 (1988) with Bruce Willis being the lone hero and First Blood (1982) with Sylvester Stallone being the lone hero/villain. I'm not saying Olympus has Fallen is anywhere as good as those two but in its own rights it is an OK film, all you have to do is close your eyes to the height of unrealistic events and you have a good film. The plot itself is centered on a redemption course, as the lead Mike Banning (Gerald Butler) is a secret service agent who under his watch the President's wife died in an accident (it was a car accident and it wasn't his fault).He got re-posted as the President was finding it hard to cope, because seeing Mike made him remember his loss. Then on a faithful day a man named Kang Yeonsak (Rick Yune) a North Korean terrorist, disguises himself as a South Korean ministerial aide and somehow managed to kidnap the President by launching an attack on the white house forcing the President to run into his bunker with the South Korean minister and his aides.Now, Banning is our lone hero in the white house who must save the president's son and the president himself.My main problem is that if it is that easy to take over the White House then I'm really sorry for America.As far as acting goes, Gerald Butler was not the man that impressed me it was the villain Rick Yune that did the job for me in the movie and as usual Morgan Freeman is just as impressive as ever. Although let me not be hard on Butler he was OK. The movie didn't do so well in the general consensus when you view its approval ratings from critics, like half of them didn't feel it, and you won't blame them the movie is one that you can only like if you hang all your senses at the door and just decide to just watch a movie and not be expectant.Aaron Eckhart is still finding it hard in my view to top the performance he gave us in Dark Knight, but notwithstanding if you are game for some unrealistic event towards making an action packed, one man hero movie then this is a movie you should see, if you are not maybe you should miss this one.www.lagsreviews.com",Olympus Has Fallen
135,Cinemaniac1984,"Ignore the flag waving propaganda and plot holes, and enjoy it for what it is",6,17 January 2015,"To sum it up: Olympus Has Fallen is Die Hard in the White House. Coincidentally in the same year another movie was released with the same story which was White House Down, another Die Hard in the White House.Olympus Has Fallen is not the most original movie, but it was inevitable that someone would come up with the idea what if terrorists took over the White House? And the answer: you have Olympus Has Fallen. It's full of plot holes you could fire a cannon through, there is an overuse of CGI (too much of it can ruin a movie) and there is plenty of patriotic flag waving propaganda, but that aside there is a lot of brutally violent action scenes (although a bit over the top at times) and a decent cast led by Gerard Butler.Olympus Has Fallen tells the tale of Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) who is removed from the Presidential Detail and reassigned to a desk job following a car accident which claimed the life of the First Lady (Ashley Judd). Although he saves President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), Mike Banning has never forgiven himself for failing to save the first lady.Fast forward 18 months later and the White House comes under attack by a customised C-130 Hercules which opens fire on Washington DC and the White House, killing many civilians, Secret Service Agents, and Washington DC Police Officers. As Mike Banning rushes to the White House, inside President Asher and his staff as well as the visiting Korean Prime Minister and his detail are rushed into a secret bunker to stay safe from the attack. Unbeknownst to everyone, the Korean detail swiftly kills all the Secret Service Agents and take President Asher and the staff hostage. The Korean Head of Security is revealed to be the mastermind behind the entire attack and the lead terrorist Kang (Rick Yune). Mike Banning has managed to gain access inside the White House and wages a one man war on the Korean terrorists. It is revealed that Banning was previously a Special Forces Soldier before joining the Secret Service. Banning is determined to save President Asher as well as many innocent lives at stake. Outside, the Speaker of the House Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) who takes over the role of Acting President and is responsible for the handling of the crisis.Truth be told there are a lot of plot holes and there are many questions that need to be asked. For example, how did the terrorists get a hold of a customised C-130 Hercules? How was it possible to mobilise 40+ terrorists and how were they able to get a hold of so many weapons? And there is more but you will have to see it as I'm not going to include any spoilers. I'm probably thinking too much into it but the intention of the movie was definitely a ""leave your brain at the door, forget all logic and just enjoy the movie"".I found myself groaning at much of the flag waving propaganda. It was expected, but nonetheless it gets on your nerves after a while.There was an overuse of CGI, particularly with many of the action scenes and this detracted a lot from the movie.I won't dispute the fact the action was quite enjoyable and I found myself cheering on Gerard Butler kicking butt and taking names. Yes it was violent. Yes the violence was brutal. Yes it was good to see that it was not watered down, unlike many movies nowadays which do so to attract a wider audience.Gerard Butler is very likable as Mike Banning, who springs into action when the President is taken hostage and the White House comes under attack. Aaron Eckhart does a good job as President Asher. Morgan Freeman never has a bad role and is perfect as Speaker Trumbull who is now Acting President. Rick Yang is chilling as the ruthless terrorist mastermind Kang but one can't help that his character would be more suited to a video game franchise such as Call of Duty or Battlefield.I kept putting this off after seeing the original trailer thinking this would not be good, but I found myself surprised.

136,Just-A-Girl-14,Unrealistic but still fun,8,29 June 2020,Hollywood style high paced action movie. Completely unrealistic and predictable but still fun.

137,akcenat,Insanely surreal generic Hollywood no-brainer action blockbuster,6,26 December 2019,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" is typical action blockbuster released in 2013 that depicts a terrorist attack on the White House and the efforts of a Secret Service agent (Gerard Butler) leading the fightback. There are many things you could accuse this movie of being, but one of them is not boring. Delivered with big Hollywood production, it is a flick with predictable plot and almost sadistically violent scenes. Supporting performances are solid (Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Ashley Judd and somewhere less Dylan McDermott) while Rick Yune makes an effective villain and Morgan Freeman is more presidential than Aaron Eckhart. At the end, this isn't the type of movie you will go to watch because you want to think about it. It's the kind of movie you watch for the action and on that level, it manages to succeed - initial attack on the White House is well staged, though the film never really tops that sequence, action-wise. Yes, the film borders on the absurd - especially when grenades and artillery are being fired directly into the White House front door and secret service guys are simply running out directly into the line of fire with their guns drawn and being mowed down - but it's fun times for action movie fans. Also have in mind that, despite a mixed reaction from critics, movie did earned $170 million worldwide and followed by two sequels to date - ""London Has Fallen"" (2016) and ""Angel Has Fallen"" (2019). It also seems that there are plans for another trilogy of films in the future.Rating: 6",Olympus Has Fallen
138,djfrost-46786,Good movie,6,10 December 2018,This was an ok movie when it came out. It came out the same as another movie just like it. That's the down fall of the movie. Other than that it's good action movie. Yes it's a 6 out of 10 hard. Better than a lot of movies that are put out today.,Olympus Has Fallen
139,LloydBayer,How The Mighty Have Fallen.,5,21 March 2013,"What do you call a movie that borrows and steals (no begging because ""the United States does not negotiate with terrorists"") bits and pieces and even huge chunks from great action movies from the 1980s and 1990s? Try OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. Alternatively, a fitting title would have been HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN and by that I am not just referring to director Antoine Fuqua.From its opening scene of the American flag fluttering to the last scene of the American flag fluttering, the narrative is nothing but a brutal illustration of a song all Americans hold dear – The Star Spangled Banner. It's one thing to be patriotic while injecting moderate dosages of propaganda (think ZERO DARK THIRTY). But what do you call propaganda that goes pro bono? As Fuqua and his newly recruited screenwriters have aptly called it: OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN. Moving up the ranks from a two-faced politician in THE DARK KNIGHT to the President of the United States, Aaron Eckhart's President Benjamin Asher loses his wife during Christmas (Ashley Judd as First Lady Margaret Asher) in a freakish turn of events that not even NASA or NORAD or the NSA saw coming. Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) confines himself to a world of guilt even though he did the best he could to save the First Lady. But Lo and behold! Banning's chance at redemption comes knocking, actually thundering through the air when The White House comes under siege by Korean terrorists. As the whole world watches in horror (because the most powerful man on Earth is held hostage in the most protected building on Earth) only one man will risk his life to prove a point; everyone else risking their lives will die because they don't have anything to prove.Seen this movie before? Once upon a time not too long ago, German terrorists hijacked the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles during a Christmas party. Little did they know that they would be dealing with a stubborn cop that wouldn't quit nosing around. But 25 years later and after the abysmal DIE HARD 5, it's time John McClane stepped aside, making way for Mike Banning – a Secret Agent cum Special Forces operative cum one man army who has main antagonist Kang (Rick Yune) eating kimchee out of his hands in no time. Why Korea? Now that ZERO DARK THIRTY director Kathryn Bigelow has tagged and bagged Osama bin Laden's big toe, who will the mighty US war machine trains its sights on? New enemies of course! ARGO made the Iranians look like fools. RED DAWN was remade, if anything, to point a finger at North Korea. And so the show of force continues on why the United States will never have to negotiate with terrorists.From having made memorable political thrillers like TRAINING DAY and SHOOTER, Fuqua falls flat with this ridiculously unrealistic action romp that also happens to be the most predictable movie yet. Morgan Freeman takes over as the acting President and then uses his documentary styled narration to spice up every dialogue with an exclamation. And since Freeman is in the movie Judd tags along for the ride like peas in a pod. Then there is Dylan McDermott in another very badly written role where you end up wondering what's the point of his character in the first place. As far as the action goes, there is plenty of mayhem and bloodletting with bombs bursting in the air and rockets going out in a red glare. But even after all the expended firepower that gives the White House a Swiss cheese makeover, Fuqua doesn't measure up to Roland Emmerich's panache for obliterating the White House (INDEPENDENCE DAY and 2012). Speaking of which, we may have to watch this movie again come summer 2013 as Emmerich has taken the liberty to simply call it WHITE HOUSE DOWN. Go figure! Where Fuqua gets it right is in the final scene. The message is more modest than forced and it acknowledges that years of continues war has brought America down on her knees. That her former glory and might awaits and will continue to be the 'Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave' as long as her children come together, differences aside, and begin rebuilding the nation. God bless America!",Olympus Has Fallen
140,diac228,More a background movie than a foreground movie,5,8 November 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of movie that serves best as background clutter while you browse the internet, drink with friends, or get some chores done. There is nothing spectacular about the movie, there is even less plausible about the entire darn thing. It came, it went, and it left. Nothing more, nothing less. Take it for what it is, and you can't really be disappointing.Picture Die Hard with no personality, less action, less sense, worse acting, worse pacing, weaker directing, inferior special effects, and overall less quality. But the influence of the Bruce Willis masterpiece can be displayed all over the place.And this is why it settles for background noise.To make a long story short, Koreans take over the White House and in the midst of the blitzkrieg attack one man (Gerald Please-Bring-Me-Back-to-300-Fame Butler) winds up inside the House and fights his way through enemy territory to save the president—who has been kidnapped and kept alive because of a detail he knows. The plot earns points by not attempting to throw any twists—it's just a straightforward plot complete with chippy dialogue that contains tons of threats and one-liners.The script and premise never gives this movie a chance to be anything special. And it seems like there was very little budget handed to the production crew responsible for trying to make this a hit. If you need proof just look at the special effects that resembled that of 90s action movies. Antoine Fuqua didn't have the precision of his best work Training Day, but had glimpses of quality with the tension and some of the required American imagery.Olympus Has Fallen is the kind of movie you have seen before. It is the kind of movie that you can predict from start to finish. It is the kind of movie that reminds you constantly that there are plenty of better options out there. The cast was good, some of the action was there----but if this had been a movie released before the awesome arsenal of late 80s/90s action flicks it would have been a bigger deal.If you can catch it for free, watch it once and forget it. If you have to pay a pennythere are better ways to spend that penny.",Olympus Has Fallen
141,EthanBJones_03,It's mindless fun and a pretty darn good action film. Would Recommend.,8,19 March 2017,"Plot Overview: When terrorists attack the white house and hold the president hostage, it's up to Mike Banning(Gerard Butler), a disgraced ex-secret service, to stop the terrorists and save the president.Directed by Antoine FuquaStarring: Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart and Rick Yune.# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie is a solid fun time that you can enjoy. If you said it was dumb and unrealistic, I'd say you were right but that you were also taking it way too seriously. It's got solid action, a solid premise and solid acting. The plot is stupid but you just need to enjoy the film for what it is; a harmless action flick that you can watch with your friends.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Good:1. Gerard Butler provides one of his greatest ever performances as Mike Banning and you believe that he truly is a one man army.2. Aaron Eckhart does a great job as President Asher and actually impressed me.3. Morgan Freeman is great a Speaker Trumbull.4. In a very pleasant surprise, Rick Yune is fantastic in his role as Kang and provides a sinister and chilling performance that is scarily convincing. 5. All the characters, especially the villain, were interesting and had distinguishable traits.6. The premise of the movie is absolutely incredible and is just fantastic. 7. The 'End Game' weapon was also interesting and quite unique.8. After Gerard Butler has entered 'Olympus' the cinematography becomes great and you really feel isolated and alone which puts you directly in the shoes of Banning. It provides an eerie and claustrophobic atmosphere that follows you throughout the film.9. Excellent action scenes which are drastically aided by the atmosphere made by the cinematography. There is a real fear off unpredictability and you don't know when the next guys gonna come out and attack.Bad:1. Two performances didn't impress me. Radha Mitchell as Leah and Dylan McDermott as Dave Forbes. Neither actor impressed me nor did their characters even really help with the plot.2. The whole character of his wife was completely pointless and she just didn't need to exist.3. Some gunfights looked a little fight but this wasn't common.4. Most of the effects were pretty poor.8/10Would Recommend",Olympus Has Fallen
142,johnnymacbest,A solid action flick.,8,7 April 2013,"After the disappointing ""Die Hard 5"" I came into this film with high expectations and needless to say I was really impressed. Not only does this has great action scenes and not only does this has a well-written script and acting, but it also has a very plausible storyline. Who would've thought this up? No one in particular but Antoine Fuqua makes it work very smoothly. Some of the characters seem underdeveloped, but I can overlook that in what is a very competent action movie, the likes of which hasn't been seen since..well...Shooter. ""Olympus Has Fallen is another great flick by Mr. Fuqua. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next.",Olympus Has Fallen
143,HelenMary,"Brillianty tense, exciting and believable.",8,15 April 2013,"Olympus has fallen was a lot better than I expected, and nice to see it at a preview screening. It was reminiscent of Speed in terms of the faced-paced, relentless stress but also films like Die Hard or Bad Boys for their big-building explosions and creeping around in crawl spaces and big shoot 'em ups. Gerard Butler was amazing; very well cast, a formidable screen presence, realistic, controlled, and smooth. He obviously had trained a lot for the role, and wasn't as ""Hollywood"" as some action films have their leading men where they always win, do everything perfectly, make leaps of judgment and don't end up even slightly injured! What transpired was gripping and felt real, especially in the light of current affairs. The fight scenes didn't seem scripted, were tough and brutal, and the rating at the beginning said there was ""strong and bloody violence,"" and they weren't wrong. Banning (Butler) was ex Special Forces, ex Secret Service, and it showed in his abilities, especially after seeing Act of Valour (real SAS) and there were some unusual shows of violence, and strength. Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman were both really good; Eckhart as the President and Freeman as Speaker of the House. Finley Jacobsen plays Connor the President's son and was genuine and delivered his role well in a non-child-actory kind of way. Rick Yune played cold, calculating bad guy equally well, and was shocking in places. Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser (both from Pitch Black) and Angela Bassett as SS Director were also well cast. Nothing in the film was silly, overblown or poorly executed, and it could have been really flag-waving American but wasn't and you just felt what was going on could actually happen. It flowed seamlessly. The clips of newsreels added to the tension, and made it relevant on the world stage. Over all it was tense, exciting, absorbing and entertaining. I'd highly recommend it. There were lots of surprises and things to make you go ""Woh!""",Olympus Has Fallen
144,dvc5159,"What ""Die Hard 5"" should have been.",7,22 March 2013,"I find it ironic that Gerard Butler, a Scotsman, as disgraced Secret Agent Mike Banning, embodies the spirit of John McClane much more than Bruce Willis did in that last dreadful outing. If anything, Butler has done nothing more than to cement his reputation as a bankable and likable action hero for the new generation in this old-school action movie. He has a commanding presence on-screen, quips wisecracks, bleeds when it's crucial, and dispatches the bad guys in a methodical cross between Jason Bourne and John Rambo. Not even the fine supporting cast (Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott) can take away Butler's limelight.Indeed, Antoine Fuqua's ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is not only terrific entertainment but a terrific throwback to the pivotal 90's action movie, the Die Hard clone - and this film (""Die Hard"" in the White House) is another reminder of why the trusted formula works, even if it has been dormant for nearly two decades (the last good big one being Peter Hyams' ""Sudden Death"").From the moment the film's main action start, the film doesn't stop running. The bad guys, hoo boy do they mean business. Rarely, if at all, have I seen this much brutal collateral damage in an American action film. Americans citizens get mowed down by bullets from ground and air forces. The all-American (Scottish) hero represents freedom and justice, and the bad guys represent every American's worst nightmare. I haven't seen this much political incorrectness since ""The Delta Force"". Having said that, Rick Yune surprisingly makes for an effective and nasty villain, who is relentlessly cold, smug and procedural in his mission, following the formula perfectly. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.It's fast, it's loud, it's preposterous, and yet I enjoyed every minute of it. The film is chock-full of sensational and well-shot action sequences/special effects, but its biggest strength is its cohesion. From start to finish the plot moves smoothly, and you can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. The characters are established, their motives clear, and that's that. The action sequences do not simply skip to each other, they flow perfectly like a stream, thanks to crisp editing. Simplicity is key here, and convoluted plots do not fit in the formula (hear that, ""Die Hard 5""?)Fuqua is no stranger to action, having helmed the solid ""Shooter"" six years ago. Here he ratchets up the action up to a 10 (CGI is present but used reasonably), and he remarkably doesn't hold back on the tension. It's no ""Training Day"", but it more or less hearkens back to an Antoine Fuqua who made ""The Replacement Killers"". Just thrilling fun.Of course the plot isn't original. It's a genre picture, and what I pay to see in a genre picture is its skillful craft and cohesive plot. This film has both, and resurrects the Die Hard clone from the grave. Here I thought I was getting bored of action movies. The genre is dying, you say? Here's a solid kicker.",Olympus Has Fallen
145,asb_deutsch,"The new ""Die Hard""",8,1 September 2016,"I have watched action thriller Olympus Has Fallen (2013) and this week. 🤗After noticing London has Fallen has been released, I thought I should not delay watching Olympus Has Fallen. We don't get many hard hitting action movies like this anymore. Bad guys who mean serious business, the lone hero determined to win the day, people get killed, stuff blows up, and you get to see Ashley Judd die. What kind of red-blooded all American doesn't like seeing this kind of movie? Of course its not realistic, find an action movie that is. The whole point of a movie like this is to escape FROM reality, to shut your brain off for a couple of hours and have some fun. And yeah its pretty much Die Hard meets Air Force One but who cares its all about the excitement, seeing whats going to happen next. The only downside I had was that it was a little too obvious who the traitor was in the movie (I mean come on isn't he always a bad guy). Overall I give the movie a solid 8 out of 10. It's exactly what an action movie should be, it gives you the jumps, the thrills, a hero to root for and a villain you love to hate. Though predictable, it was like Die Hard - Commando action packed movie. Never thought such a pre-planned attack would work at the WhiteHouse. The director must have liked Aaron's and Freeman's role in TDK.If you think a movie like this isn't for you I suggest you watch a Twilight movie, it doesn't have Gerard Butler killing terrorists....but it does have a sissy that sparkles.",Olympus Has Fallen
146,jhpstrydom,A movie that is typical of its genre.,6,15 August 2013,"I noticed a lot of people complaining about the severe lack of realism but in reality OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN is actually a typical movie of its genre. For example we have bad guys that roll in and fly in into town that shoots everything in sight and note how they hardly miss. Then you have a secret service bad ass named Mike Banning played by Gerard Butler who comes in and starts taking out the bad guys and then note how the bad guys try to shoot him and never manages to hit him with a single round. And that pretty much sums up a large amount of action movies that have been released over the years.In terms of realism there virtually is none. In terms of the acting the cast give okay performances but I've seen better from each and every actor in this film but nothing hinders this movie from just being dumb entertainment where you get to tell the uptight film critic in you to take five and just take the film as it is.Overall, if you prefer realism consider giving this film a pass. If you want simple entertainment and would like to see a DIE HARD style action movie with typical genre trademarks then give it a go.",Olympus Has Fallen

When the White House and The President are taken over by international terrorist Kang(Rick Yune),Mike must step into Action and rescue The President at all costs.Remember back in the late 80s all the way up to the mid-90s when there was a lot of Die Hard-inspired Action films whether it was on a bus(Speed),mountain(Cliffhanger),sea or an airplane(Air Force One)Olympus Has Fallen a solid,entertaining Action film can be best described as Die Hard In The White House and if you like Die Hard or any Die Hard inspired Action movie you will like Olympus Has Fallen. One of the things that I like about OHF is that the movie embraces it's R-Rated attitude because over the past ten years most Action movies have been toned down and PG-13 and trying to appeal to all audiences,but OHF takes viewers back to the 80s and 90s when Action films were violent and bloody,showing viewers how violence really is. That's one of the things that I liked about OHF is that it never tones itself down or compromise the violence seen in the film. Watching the movie reminded me when I was kid watching Action movies during the 1990s where most Action movies used a certain formula and it works OHF uses the Die Hard formula to perfect and gives us a Action film that's not original but works as entertaining popcorn movie and crowd pleaser. What I also like about the film is that OHF was a pretty bold movie to make as well because we rarely see Action movies with terrorists anymore since 9-11 happened and you rarely see Action films or films in general where the White House has been taken hostage and when the White House being taken over it is done with intensity and grit. What is also great about OHF is that the film has your typical Action film Clichés(i.e tough Action hero,smart villain)and that it does not try to hide the fact that it is Chiche. While OHF has a serious storyline and tone you as the viewer don't have to take the movie serious because OHF is a film that has one goal in mind and that goal is to have a great fun time and OHF gives viewers a great time from start to finish that will put smiles on viewers faces and will have viewers glued to the screen with fun and excitement. At 119 minutes the OHF moves at a fast pace and never slows down from the opening scene and the pace is so quick you don't have any time to catch your breath. Mike Banning is a great character who is definitely in the same mode as Action icon John McClane,with Mike being an individual who is tough and can always handle himself in a intense and violent situation. Mike not only uses his fists,but also uses smarts and words to deal with a problem. Mike Banning is an old school Action hero in the truest form. The Action and violent scenes in the film are well done with great gunfights,fist fights and handled in a natural way with a certain brutality and grit much like the Action films in the past. The ending of the film while cliché,is exciting and a good cap off to the film and will have you cheering.The cast does a wonderful job in their roles. Gerald Butler is excellent as Mike Banning,with Butler bringing toughness,grit and great lines to the role. Aaron Eckhart is great as President Benjamin Asher,a President who does not take any crap. Rick Yune is wonderful and menacing as Kang,the film's villain. Morgan Freeman(Speaker Trumbull),Angela Bassett(Lynn Jacobs)and Melissa Leo(Ruth McMillain) give great supporting performances in the film. Radha Mitchell(Leah),Dylan McDermott(Forbes),Robert Forester(General Edward Clegg),Ashley Judd(Margaret Asher)and Finley Jacobsen(Connor)give fine performances as well.The direction by Antoine Fuqua is excellent,with Fuqua always moving the camera and bringing intensity to every scene and Fuqua also does a great job with the Action scenes. Great direction,Fuqua.The score by Trevor Morris is good and well done and fits in with the tone of the film. A good score by Morris.In final word,if you love Action films,I highly suggest you see Olympus Has Fallen,an entertaining,old fashioned Action film that is well worth your time. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10.",Olympus Has Fallen
149,kylehaines96,Olympus Has Fallen(2013) Film Review,8,27 May 2013,"Rating: *** Out Of ****.Rated R For Strong Violence And Language Throughout.1hr 59min/119min.48 uses of the F-word.Olympus Has Fallen Seems like it could be a summer blockbuster and a really well done action movie. However, the film plays like a mediocre yet fun action film. The film is directed by Antoine Fuqua who also directed 2001's Training Day and 2010's Brooklyn's Finest, both films are riveting well made films. Olympus Has Fallen has a lot of opportunities that Fuqua makes and many that he doesn't. Instead of a smart film, it plays off as a fun Die Hard Clone.Mike Banning(Gerard Butler) is the bodyguard to President Ashby(Aaron Eckhart) who is fired after an accident in which the President's wife dies after a car accident on a snowy road. 2 years later he returns when the White House is taken over by a group of terrorists and hold the President hostage which leaves Speaker Trumbull(Morgan Freeman) as acting president. Mike decides to take matters into his own hands and fights his way through the White House and save the President before it's too late.The acting is how you would expect in a film like this; not very good. The performances are sub-par with only 2 standout performers, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart. However even though Eckhart is credited as the main performer, he is only in the film for 25 minutes, which is not enough time to develop a strong President. Why is Banner fighting for him? Why do the terrorists care the most about him? We never know. Morgan Freeman is good in any movie he is in but only in it for 15 minutes. Gerard Butler plays the typical bad-ass in an action film and Dylan McDermott plays a typical villain. But I will say that it has a very diverse assortment of actors.The story is what redeems the film. I will say that they had some serious balls to make a movie about a national monument being attacked which might provoke images of 9/11. You also have some terrific action scenes and some great special effects. However we do have he stereotypical foreign terrorists, but they are surprisingly More brutal then the usual movie terrorists, Is the film worth seeing. Yes. I would say that I would buy it on Blu-Ray when it comes out because it was fun even though we have not-so strong performances.",Olympus Has Fallen
150,jb_campo,High-octane thriller although pretty unbelievable,7,10 February 2019,"Make sure you put on your seat belt before watching Olympus Has Fallen because it's a high-octane thriller of a ride. Gerard Butler is the head of the President's (Aaron Eckart) secret service protection and a long-time friend. Butler and the President experience a singular pain after a Camp David visit, which causes Butler to resign.Fast forward 18 months and the South Korean Prime Minister visits the White House to discuss the North Korean threat. Then suddenly, all hell breaks lose. Highly improbable action takes place all around the White House, which is suddenly under siege from everywhere. Before you know it, Olympus has fallen and the bad guys are in charge.The rest of the movie is your standard bad guy vs good guy thriller - a pretty cool cat and mouse game, leading to a showdown and a Hollywood ending.The acting is good, but stereotyped. The President is tough. Butler is ruthless. The generals are all hardened vets who just want to act without thinking. Morgan Freeman plays the Speaker who get thrust into the President's chair, and he does his standard terrific job. The bad guy is the same from James Bond fame, and he's tough and ruthless too. There's a whiny Secretary of State, and well, good vs bad. No one strayed far from the standard.The story was not plausible. Too many holes in plots that you could drive a Sanitation truck thru. So many people walking around with major weapons so close to the White House? No barriers around the White House? Lack of sense by jet fighter pilots? It just goes on and on. But put all that aside and enjoy the escapism. The White House was pretty well modeled. The bunker looks realistic. The plot, when revealed, was pretty ingenious. And the fighting was well choreographed. At times, Butler showed a little bit of John Wick because he'd been pushed well beyond his tolerance for punks.All told, a lot of violence, and blood. Not a complex story, but good acting with what the script afforded them. A surprisingly decent film with Gerard Butler kicking butt and taking names.
Enjoy.",Olympus Has Fallen
151,luke-a-mcgowan,"Insulting, with terrible writing and a few awful performances.",3,22 November 2015,"Had Gerard Butler revealed himself to have magical powers at the film's conclusion, I would have only been marginally surprised. For sitting through Olympus Has fallen requires such a complete and total suspension of disbelief that superpowers would only have been a mild shift from what I'd already seen.Olympus Has Fallen (Die Hard: With a White House) is a shameless popcorn movie set in a period where the North Koreans have seized the White House during a South Korean summit. During an air assault, the President and co are rushed to a secure bunker, bringing all the South Koreans with them, only for many of the South Koreans to reveal themselves as moles and take the President hostage.OK. Deep breaths. We'll get through this.The military and Secret Service in this film are so inept and incompetent that the North Koreans deserve to massacre them. A C-130 manages to fly from North Korea (how they got one, let alone learned to fly one, is never explained) all the way across Europe/USA and into Washington's outer suburbs without detection. In a post 9/11 world, yeah right. Its not until they reach Virginia that anyone thinks to challenge the plane, which promptly shoots down fighter jets with miniguns and continues on course. Leaving aside the physical impossibilities of that, the fact that the air force has no one else on standby or that they waited until over civilian territory to challenge the plane is mind boggling. Later in the film, the man in charge of that same air force orders an aerial assault despite being told that a revolutionary AA gun is sitting on top. Good planning, her-durrr.The military are pathetic, firing a single round of Anti Air rockets at the C-130 before promptly giving up and never trying again. We learn later in the film that there's a huge anti- air gun just near the top, which the North Koreans use against Black Hawks, but they give up and instead try catching North Korean lead in their chests. The minigun is stupidly more accurate than anything of its kind has any business being, and many SS agents are slaughtered. Then comes the worst of all - the secret service. They are butchered by a North Korean militia which magically appears out of nowhere and rushes the White House with high powered sniper rifles and SMGs. The Secret Service are completely pathetic and the North Korean militia is apparently never ending. The protocol of taking the South Koreans into the Presidential bunker just because the President said to is the whole reason for the movie, and would never ever happen in a million years.Okay. Now we're good. Let's talk about the movie. The screenplay is excruciating. The South Korean/American bilateral talks are so exposition- for-stupid-people heavy that even Die Another Day was wincing in pain. There's paper thin characters that have no logical thought process - such as the American who betrays his country to North Korea. NORTH Korea! What possible benefit is there to that! If he was successful, he'd have a glorious life living in Pyongyang, would he? Conversations between Butler and the main antagonist feel ripped straight out of Die Hard, threats come across as incredibly lame and there's some choice dialogue that made me scream in frustration, such as ""movement along the Korean DMZ MIGHT be connected with what's going on in Washington.""Butler does a good job, he's a solid action star even if he's channelling Bruce Willis most of the time. There's a couple of interrogation scenes where he is a great hero to barrack for. Morgan Freeman and Angela Basset bring dignified work to their characters, as to be expected. However, much of the rest of the cast is either wasted or terrible. Melissa Leo, only three years removed from her Oscar win, screams a pledge of allegiance as she is dragged through the hallway, making all of us wine in embarrassment. Rick Yune is an adequate but forgettable villain, often annoying with Marty McFly-coward reactions. Aaron Eckhart might just be the worst movie President of all time. His performance is truly awful, his logic even worse (if someone has information that terrorists need, don't order them to give it up to ease their suffering!!! If they die, the information is forever denied to the terrorists. But if they give it up, they are free to die and can be used to get information out of others!) Eckhart pulls faces and bites off truly unconvincing delivery, and he doesn't even look like a President.Antoine Fuqua is a hit or miss director, and Olympus Has Fallen is a big miss. The action is kinda cool, but there's some choppy editing and awful cinematography during fight scenes. There is no need for the camera to track a kick, nor is there any need to cut on every single impact. It worked in Whiplash, but not here.

152,trublu215,A sufficient actioner with more than enough action to go around,7,24 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen marks Antoine Fuqua's return to the action genre and man, does it deliver. The film plays out like a 90s action film, garnering a hard R rating with hard R violence, which pans out to it's benefit. The film's lead, Gerard Butler, plays his role effortlessly. While donning some cheesy one liners that only Bruce Willis would conjure up, Butler relishes in his role as one bad-ass force to be reckoned with. However, the film's most welcomed performance lies within Aaron Eckhart. His charisma resembles his performance in The Dark Knight but there is a certain controlled rage that boils deep beyond what the roles calls for ad Eckhart does this particularly well within his facial expressions. As far as the other performances go, most are after thoughts from previous characters that we've seen out of most of the cast which includes Morgon Freeman and Melissa Leo, both Oscar winners. However, with these rather tamed performances, that is not where the film suffers.Unfortunately with all the good, there is some bad. The film does resemble that of a 90s action film and it does it with enough grace to allow it to be pardoned from the typical action clichés...for the most part. The film does dwell into the B movie genre just a bit especially with certain scenes that will, most likely, garner some eye rolls from certain audience members. One, in particular, exists in the subplot with finding the president's's son within the overtaken White House. For lack of spoilers, all I will say on the matter is that if it was taken to another level or left out of the first act, then it most likely would have made for a more balanced film.Overall, Olympus Has Fallen makes for one hell of a ride. The violence is brutal, the one liners are cheesy, but it's all in good fun. Fuqua delivers an intense action thrill ride that is most certainly worth the $12 of admission and worth leaving your brain at home to enjoy this utterly ridiculous and graceful addition to the action genre.",Olympus Has Fallen

Ignore the reviews that ascribe any political meaning to any part of this movie. It could have been on any soil, with any invading country. If you can get past that irrelevant and inconsequential detail, then you are in for a couple hours of pure action, explosion after explosion, hand to hand fighting, and a few very ""US Marines"" style stabbings.
Good, straight-forward story that you want to see through to the end. The movie begins with some pretty solid ""pull at your heart's string"" attempts, which do a good job landing. The characters are well written, and the violence is on a huge scale (ie: death count at least 1000+)

I thought ""Olympus had fallen"" looked pretty rotten from its trailer, but I fell for several reviews that I read, telling me that it was apparently pretty good.Those who said it was good, are wrong. Those who say it just looks like ""Die-hard in the Whitehouse"" are probably more right than they realise. Gerard Butler tries to act all John McClane, running into a terrorist infested building, and becoming the one man army that must stand up against them. But he's no Bruce Willis. He attempts to pass of the same tough guy attitude, but ultimately fails. In one scene pointing out how unprofessional his superiors are being, before willingly giving away his position to the bad-guys by calling them up just to tease them. Idiot! Now the movie does actually start of pretty promising, but by the end I was pulling my hair out. It essentially is just ""Die-hard!"" Right down to a bad guy pretending he's an escaped hostage, and sharing a cigarette with the hero. The awesome invasion that kicks off the movie soon leads to Butler single handily taking on the 10 or so individual terrorists (Even though it took hundreds of them to carry out the invasion) and a rescue attempt with a helicopter spectacularly fails, by getting blown up and having Butler jumping out of the way to safety.I mean the titles even pretty rubbish isn't it. Though I would probably have another reason to slate it if it was called ""hard to kill"" or ""Hard target"" or something. As it is, ""Olympus has fallen"" probably sums it up pretty well. What could have been half decent, has fallen to very low depths, with its lack of originality, and a plot that struggles to be credible in any way. On top of that, its riddled with terrible dialogue and an unbelievable over use of slow motion flags blowing in the wind. As cheesy as it gets this.",Olympus Has Fallen
157,galahad58-1,Plagiarism --- Just About,5,16 August 2013,"The screenplay is as close as you can get to plagiarism without having a lawsuit thrown at you. There is not one single original idea in this movie and you can find all the scenes stolen from other action films over the last twenty years. Even the dialog has no originality to the point that you can predict every coming sequence by the scene/commentary prior. You know before hand who the traitor will be, you know before hand every action that is going to happen, you know you will have the higher up who does not listen to the hero, you know the timer for the bomb is going to go below 5 seconds, you know that the bad guy is going to crack the code and it will be certain doom for all of America, you know that every single other good guy (sans the hero) will be incompetent, and you know that there will be an attempt at humor in the dialog. The humor part fails badly because Butler has almost no charisma. He cannot pull off the John McClain act at all and it has shown in his other movies. The preposterous, cliché, stupid plot that a terrorist can find out about a top secret American project that even top flight Americans don't know is beyond believable. That the terrorist knows exactly what computer to use, what codes (and who has the codes) to use and what it does is beyond dumb and dumber. The only bright spot is Morgan Freeman -- who is very good in his limited role. Other than that, it is one stolen moment after another with none of the UMPH that a Clint Eastwood, Bruce Willis, Arnold, etc would bring to that kind of role.",Olympus Has Fallen
158,gregeichelberger,Better than the usual crop of action-adventures,5,8 April 2013,"U.S. Presidents have not always fared so well in Hollywood over the years. After all, Franchot Tone died of cancer in ""Advise and Consent"" (1962), Henry Fonda had to deal with the Reds blowing up everything in ""Fail-Safe"" (1964) and Fredric March was weakened and almost overthrown that same year in ""Seven Days in May."" In more recent times, Richard Nixon was pilloried in ""All the President's Men"" (1976), Jack Warden as President 'Bobby' was made to look foolish in ""Being There"" (1980), John F. Kennedy was blown away in ""JFK"" (1991), Bill Pullman had his residence destroyed AND had to appear with Will Smith and Randy Quaid in ""Independence Day"" (1996) and Harrison Ford survived bullets, terrorism, traitors and a plane crash in ""Air Force One"" (1997).There are certainly more examples, but I think the point has been made. The newest Chief Executive to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune is Aaron Eckhart (""The Dark Knight""), who, as President Benjamin Asher, is kidnapped, beaten and held hostage in the action thriller by Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day""), ""Olympus Has Fallen"". And while borrowing quite heavily from ""Die Hard,"" as well as the TV series ""24,"" it has enough bangs, flashing lights, falling aircraft and piling bodies to stand — somewhat — on its own as a decent entry into the genre.The lead, however, is Gerard Butler who, coming off twin turkeys ""Chasing Mavericks"" and ""Playing for Keeps,"" has a lot to prove here. As Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, he needs not only to work his way back into the audience's good grace, but the White House's as well. It seems after saving the president's life in an automobile incident 18 months prior (at the cost of the life of the First Lady (Ashley Judd, ""Dolphin Tale""), Asher rewarded him by kicking him off his detail - not because of incompetence - but because the memories were just too painful to the Prez (yes, I know it makes no sense, but - again - I didn't write this thing).Now working at a desk at the Treasury Dept., Banning is at the right place and the right time when North Korean terrorists - through an amazing battle plan and several convenient plot holes one could drive tanks between - take over and secure the White House. The President, Vice President, Secretary of Defense (a feisty Melissa Leo, ""The Fighter"") and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, among others, are also captured and held in the building's bunker. This only happens because of an amazing breach of Protocol by the Secret Service (I didn't write this thing). Surviving and uttering lines like, ""I'm the only chance you got,"" Butler gets to play the John McClane part that Bruce Willis once owned (during the first two films, anyway). And while not nearly as fun or sardonic as Willis was then, Butler is light years better than him in the last installment of the franchise, ""A Good Day to Die Hard.""As expected ""Olympus Has Fallen"" has more than its fair share of killing off of the bad guys. Many are offed with relative ease by various means (broken necks, gunshots to the head, strangulations, slit throats, knives to the brain, etc., etc., etc.); none, however, are dispatched with the clever patter of other action heroes, like Willis, Sly Stallone or Ah-nold.They all lead to the top dog, Kang (Rick Yune, ""The Man with the Iron Fists""), who, while evil enough, could have used a little of the delightful brutality of Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" or Gary Oldman in ""Air Force One,"" and make it seem he at least relished being the bad guy.There's a few side arcs to follow while all of this is going on — most notable is the one involving Speaker of the House, Rep. Trumbull (Morgan Freeman, ""The Dark Knight Rises""), who has to decide between obeying the terrorist decree of recalling the Seventh Fleet and pulling troops form the North-South Korean Demilitarized Zone or saving the lives of the hostages, as Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs (Angela Bassett, ""What's Love Got to Do with It"") and Joint Chiefs Gen. Edward Clegg (Robert Forster, ""The Descendants"") throw their two cents in.Clegg, by the way, is another incompetent who actually wants Bannig - the only good guy capable of saving the situation - to stand down (like I said, I didn't write this thing).So, will Banning save the day and can Butler save his career?The first part of the question is a foregone conclusion. The second is still up in the air. Fuqua, who directed Denzel Washington to a Best Actor award in ""Training Day,"" does not have those kind of thespian chops here. But with several Oscar nominees (as well as winners in Freeman and Leo), the cast helps him raise Butler's effort above that of your ordinary film of this genre. Freeman, Leo, Bassett and Eckhart are especially earnest in their roles and bring just the right amount of support and realism.In the end ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is still loud, violent, messy and sometimes just plain ridiculous (as when it takes almost hours to get the military to arrive in force at the scene), but if you suspend a little disbelief and are in the mood for such a picture, you will no doubt be on the edge of your seat throughout.",Olympus Has Fallen
159,nesfilmreviews,A fine piece of North Korean propaganda.,3,12 August 2013,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" exhausts itself even without the burden of originality. The White House is under attack, and John McClain still isn't available -- he is still recouping from his recent disastrous installment to the ""Die Hard"" franchise. Everything in this movie, credited to writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt, is seemingly directly taken from the action classic ""Die Hard"" (1988). Having a man on the inside is one thing -- but to the bumbling idiots in authority, the rooftop adventure gone bad, the hero mistaking a bad guy for a good guy... it's a hostage movie alright, a storyline almost completely lifted from the 1988 classic starring Bruce Willis. A group of North Korean militants launch an attack on Washington D.C. and manage to take over the White House. President Asher (Aaron Eckhart), the Vice President (Phil Austin), and the Secretary of Defense (Melissa Leo), are held hostage in the emergency bunker beneath the now ruined White House. The militants' leader Kang (Rick Yune) demands now acting President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), for the withdrawal of American troops from the DMZ and the Seventh Fleet from the far Pacific. But Kang hasn't reckoned with Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), a Secret Service agent forced to take a desk job months earlier after failing to save the life of the First Lady (Ashley Judd, in what amounts to a little more than a cameo) in an auto accident. He witnesses the assault on the White House and gets involved, eventually winding up as the sole defender inside the White House. As a former Navy Seal, he systematically eliminates most of the remaining terrorists by breaking more necks than I could count, while also using a gun, a knife, and his mighty fists of patriotism. Banning is the ultimate one-man army who easily puts Jon McClain to shame. There are too many ridiculous plot elements to call into question, and it would take away from the flag-waving premise of the movie. The only point is to put Butler in situations where he can kick some serious terrorist ass for truth, justice, and protecting the American way. To be fair, the action is well filmed, but also quite violent and graphic while mysteriously lacking any real blood or gore. Envision grounding ""Air Force One,"" moving it inside of The White House, giving it the story of ""Die Hard,"" with the laughable characters and ridiculous screenplay of ""Red Dawn,"" and presto, I give you ""Olympus Has Fallen."" It's dreadful, noisy, and ludicrous, not even worth the effort to assess it for future guilty pleasure enjoyment. All that's missing is an ""Air Force One"" style retort like ""Get out of my HOUSE!""",Olympus Has Fallen
160,Bruce722,Unbelievable but entertaining.,5,8 April 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen felt like a live-action version of a Call of Duty game. They ignore realism and go for as much shock and awe as possible. When I say they ""ignore realism"", I don't mean it looks or feels fake, I mean the major plot points that establish the premise are ridiculously unbelievable and all of the drama hinges on those points. It makes the very well done action sequences tinge of disbelief because the scenario is flawed. As a matter of fact, all of the drama in the film suffers from these flaws. So why did I give it a not-so-terrible rating? Because Gerard Butler is such a BA that he makes this movie incredibly entertaining. The combat and fighting sequences were incredibly well done and the acting throughout, not just by Butler but really the entire cast, is great. The graphics and cinematic elements were done well also. Really, the only flaws in the film were story related but they had such a cascade effect that it hurt the entire film.

162,monkeysgalore,A Sturdy Die Hard Clone,8,23 April 2020,"People are so hard to please. Die Hard (1988) ripoffs are great when they're done right. I mean some of the best action movies are Die Hard ripoffs (The Rock (1996), Con Air (1997), Under Siege (1992)), and it's a dependable formula.One of two Die Hard clones set in the White House (the other being White House Down (2013)), Olympus Has Fallen is a bloody, vicious, gritty action movie with lots of action and violence, and strong lead performances.Antoine Fuqua, one of my favorite directors, and his skill in doing action scenes is great. He paces the movie well and shoots the scenes effectively, without an over abundance of cuts.Gerard Butler is a little more charismatic here than in some of his other roles, and he plays the disgraced, grizzled secret service agent effectively enough. He does everything right, and we want to see him win. Aaron Eckhart is fine as the president, but this isn't one of his best roles. Morgan Freeman is also here, as dependable as ever, and gives a good performance.Olympus Has Fallen abounds with violent action scenes. The initial raid on the White House is bloody and intense, and well-staged. Once Butler gets into the White House things heat up. There are three or four great fight scenes, and some brief gunplay. A helicopter also explodes. The fights are brutal and well-done, with the final fight being particularly entertaining. Butler looks good in the action and cements himself as an action star.I recommend this film to fans of the genre. It's a suitably violent and entertaining enough action film that doesn't skimp on explosions and blood. Definitely one of Fuqua's best.",Olympus Has Fallen

Alternates were available to furnish the backstory without pointless references to politicians and vehicles going off bridges. And in retrospect: if someone can save the world in the major plot, he could not have saved one person earlier? If you have not learned you shouldn't ask such questions about contemporary action films, I think you are unnecessarily limiting your enjoyment of the current cinema. For example, I've actually read a comment comparing this film unfavorably to Mission Impossible and Die Hard. Yes, and in The Three Stooges, you only liked Curly and Moe, but didn't like Larry. Give me a break.This film was rather low on believability. But who is currently making comparable and believable action films? I had a terrific time watching this. I was actually surprised, because I entered the theater with very low expectations. This film is not art. It is not a masterpiece. It won't live forever as a shining example of its genre. Its only appeal is whether the viewer bought into the premise and the action. I bought. I got my money's worth.",Olympus Has Fallen
164,PCC0921,Watch for the plastic here.,8,4 October 2020,"Let's face facts! Originality is dead. It is impossible in this world to really find originality anymore. With 2000 cable channels at your disposal, limitless Internet options, books online, on tape and on a Kindle, YouTube running rampant and countless unoriginal things on the air, like reality TV, it's, sort of, a waste of time worrying about if you are going to see something original anymore. And, I really don't think it is our fault (meaning those of us here in the 21st century). I guarantee our ancestors from the 1800s were saying the same thing. Things like, ""I read a book last night that had the same ending as the one I read last Tuesday night in the smoking room"", or, ""Oooohhh, I saw a play last night in the opera house that was so predictable and I'm sure Poe already wrote the same thing"", and, ""I rode by on my horse and cart, past a saloon on the side of the road and there was a man playing the same song on his fiddle that he plays every night ........ So unoriginal"". Everybody is going to notice something in a piece of work that they have seen before in another piece of work. I think the goal of film-makers, in the 21st century and beyond, if they decide to tackle something familiar, should channel their energy into execution instead of originality. So, let's try not to worry too much about the word original anymore. It won't fit into this review anyway, because you already saw this film in Independence Day (1996), the five Die Hard movies and the television show 24.So, how was the execution displayed in director Antoine Fuqua's Olympus Has Fallen (2013)? Not too great. The film starts off rather shocking. Watching the White House fall so quickly and seeing the President taken hostage was fairly gripping. What follows is where the originality and execution makes this film only fun with little substance. The White House under siege looked very Independence Day, the whole premise is very Die Hard, especially with Gerard Butler's love interest, Leah (Radha Mitchell), showing us puppy-dog eyes as she worries so much about her snarling boyfriend and the last 70% of the movie is all Jack Bauer. Even the effects looked a little messy in some places. The White House looked like it should have been on top of a birthday cake. It looked very plastic for something that was produced in 2013. Butler, trying every bit to be Hugh Jackman, just snarled and looked mean. I was hoping after 300 (2006), after doing some drama and romantic comedies would help his range in his acting, but I enjoyed the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman as Speaker of the House, turned temporary President Trumall and Angela Bassett as Secret Service Director Lynn Jacobs, steal the show. I guess I am still mad at Aaron Eckhart for ruining Two-Face in the Dark Knight (2008), but he was fine as the President. Olympus Has Fallen (2013), is a fun thrill ride with too much familiarity and at certain points I felt bored. Go see it. The first half hour is gripping and at times scary, the rest is the same stuff you have seen before.8.3 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Olympus Has Fallen

166,ivko,"mirror, mirror on the wall...",6,14 May 2018,"If you live long enough you'll notice something funny about the way movies are made in Hollywood. Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.The reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then ""pitch"" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.The process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.A famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.This usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the ""must have"" idea of the year.Unless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.I don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.To my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.OHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is ""we are winning and they are getting desperate"". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.Neither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.Whatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.",Olympus Has Fallen

169,mgruebel,Good mindless fun,6,24 December 2013,"Like the better Airforce 1 or In the Line of Fire, this movie was not made to be analyzed, but to be watched once for mindless action fun. At that, it succeeds, which is why it has its circa 6 rating on IMDb (an accurate reflection, unlike many highly overrated recent movies).Yes, it shall remain mysterious how moles infiltrate the highest level of the South Korean government, how terrorists can organize so many trains, planes and automobiles on US soil without ringing red bells, and how a high-jacked US armed forces cargo plane outfitted with antiaircraft equipment gets to clip the Lincoln monument.But wait, a jetliner did slam into the Pentagon once. Another plane almost made it to the White House, were it not for the bravery of passengers and crew. The FBI missed suicide pilots training on US soil under their noses. As the plot of a pre-2001 film, these would also have been decried as 'impossible' by assorted reviewers.Fortunately, the point of this movie is not technical accuracy, or logical behavior by the President (who would probably not advise his staff to give away secret codes even when they are tortured), but lively action. The progression of the action, with plenty of dead bodies, excellent set pieces, and a good villain, is carried competently by Gerard Butler and the supporting cast, including Morgan Freeman. The movie hums along with never a boring moment, and the characters are just fleshed out enough for the purpose: the secret service man unable to save the President's wife in the past, redeeming himself by saving the son and preventing the US from becoming vulnerable to a nuclear attack.I give this movie a bonus star for not being politically correct. Some people who carefully listen to the background track might be offended by tidbits such as a news item that ""the Middle East is celebrating that the White House has been attacked.""But wait, were there not elements in the streets of the middle east celebrating when certain buildings in New York went down? The saddest thing I saw on the news on September 11, 2001 was not the World Trade Center going down, but the news video of those cheering middle eastern crowds. The US has done plenty of bad stuff out there, but I don't see Americans cheering about it in the streets.This film is a primal Hollywood ""God save the US"" action flick. The politically correct and those who seek acribic accuracy should shun this film, whereas anybody who can take some pretty gory killings and a Die Hard-style tongue-in-cheek approach to action (although Die Hard 1 is better) will be well entertained for their money.",Olympus Has Fallen

But putting that aside I for one thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.The synopsis consists of disgraced (he failed to rescue the First Lady in a car accident) ex secret service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) coming to the aid of the president (Aaron Eckhart) and his son Conner (Finley Jacobesen) after the White House is taken over by terrorist Kang (Rick Yune). Meanwhile Mike is in contact with Speaker Trumbull who is the Acting President during the crisis (Morgan Freeman)As I said the plot isn't particularly realistic, but it establishes the characters and the motives, the good guys and the bad. And the plot flows nicely from the action to the story, which is refreshing as a lot of action films struggle to do that. The script isn't great unfortunately with blatant attempts at the sort of Die Hard wisecracks Bruce Willis had (which were actually funny, in this it's just embarrassing), but the actors play their parts well. The only disappointment was Rick Yune, he never really convinced me as being a fearsome adversary (unlike he did in Die Another Day as Zao). But Eckhart makes a capable enough president, but Butler is even better as a one man action hero who you root for all the way. However unsurprisingly the actor who steals the show is Morgan Freeman as the Acting President who lends gravitas and dignity to his scenes.I enjoyed the music throughout and it is crisply edited. The biggest asset throughout was the CGI, which was great and the action, that was terrifically choreographed. The best sequence being when the terrorists take over the White House. Olympus Has Fallen is an overall entertaining popcorn action movie for it's two hour length that I really enjoyed.",Olympus Has Fallen

Great action, graphic violence, profanity and humor.With all the PG13 crap out there and all the annoying superhero movies it's nice with some R-rated old school action instead of CG. If you miss the good old days of the original first three Die Hard movies, this is a must see for you.Excellent action-movie.I recommend this to true action-movie lovers.And I'm really looking forward to the sequel coming this year: London has fallen.",Olympus Has Fallen
172,comps-784-38265,Watchable All Action Nonsense,7,7 March 2016,"Having just seen the sequel ""London Has Fallen"" (I gave that 5/10) it really illustrated that Olympus Has Fallen is the much better film. To enjoy this film (or any of this genre) you have to accept you are watching an all action, one good guy versus multiple bad guys, testosterone nonsense. You can then sit back with your popcorn (or a beer) and enjoy the film as Butler saves the USA and the world just in the nick of time from evil terrorists.It is (sort of) plausible. It does develop characters and the baddie is good and evil with a dastardly plot to blow up the U.S. nukes in their silos. A film to watch without having to think too much. Good guy creams all the bad guys - one by one !",Olympus Has Fallen
173,Tehmeh,I counted a few bodies.,8,28 February 2014,"This movie was recommended to me by a guy I usually trust. I will continue trusting him.""Olympus has fallen"" has a serious Die Hardish vibe to it. This is a good thing, even though you have basically seen everything before. Plenty of action and surprisingly little anything else. Even my ""oh man, they're going to have a kid sidekick aren't they"" - fears were put to rest soon enough.This is a movie where you have to suspend your disbelief. By no means is this film flooding with intelligence or believability, and you should adjust your expectations accordingly. I went in looking for a good action movie that isn't PG13-pussified, and that is exactly what I got. The film never slows down too much, the storyline and villains are decent enough to warrant your attention, the violence is satisfying and the bodycount ends up being impressive without going full Rambo.Gerard Butler. Oh man, please don't make another romantic comedy. These are the films where you excel! Butler has the looks, physique, charisma and most important of all - passion. His performance is enjoyable to watch and got me to respect him again. No tired old men yelling about being on a vacation here, I promise.Aaron Eckhart plays his role fine enough, as does Morgan Freeman. The standout from supporting cast was however Melissa Leo. Leo was wonderful in ""Red State"" and I'm glad to see she hasn't gotten worse. The little screen time she had, she nailed every second with an intense performance.I do have some complaints, however. It's strange that nowadays a 70-million dollar budget can be considered limited, but here it's exactly what it is. The effects in some scenes look fake, usually the ones involving aircraft action. This doesn't sink the movie and the scenes in question are not bad, but it caught my eye. The oldschool man-to-man combat and shootouts are thankfully well executed from start to finish.Another (but minor) complaint: geography isn't always established very well. Sometimes it's hard to understand exactly where in the location something is happening, and it doesn't help that in some non-confined action scenes people don't seem to be facing exactly the right way after or before a cut. This takes away some of the immersion and intensity, when you don't have an established ""map"" in your head.That's it, no other complaints. I can even take the storyline without nitpicking, it gives a reason for the action itself and for me, that is enough in these movies. If you want this movie to challenge your intellect, you should look elsewhere. If you can't stand American flags or a little patriotic pathos, same answer: look elsewhere.If this film was a little tighter, little more intense and maybe could've squeezed a few more millions into its budget, it would be a modern action classic for me. Instead, it's just a very solid, enjoyable action movie and that is surely enough. Recommended for action lovers.",Olympus Has Fallen
174,Jonathon_Natsis,America! F*** Yeah!,7,17 May 2013,"Hit-and-miss action director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, King Arthur, Shooter) has assembled an all-star team of American patriots for arguably his most ambitious film, Olympus Has Fallen. When the First Lady is killed in a freak car accident, President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) has no choice but to discharge his most trusted Secret Serviceman, and close friend, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). Eighteen months later, the White House is compromised by a crack team of North Korean terrorists, and when the President is taken hostage in his own underground bunker, it is up to Banning, with the help of acting President Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), to dispense freedom, one bullet at a time.Quickly written off by most critics and sceptical moviegoers for its absurd plot and 'junk food' tendencies, Olympus succeeds in all the areas one would expect, while crashing and burning everywhere else. The action sequences are expectedly strong, led off with an exhilarating set piece showing just how the White House falls under terrorist rule. Wave upon wave of mercenary-on-authority violence ensues, satiating the viewer's bloodlust with a glorious miasma of collateral damage. The violence isn't exactly Drive-level graphic, but Fuqua isn't afraid to spill copious amounts of blood and guts when required. Both the plot and Butler's strangely endearing 'don't-take-no-guff-from-nobody' persona hark back to the fun of the first Die Hard. That said, the film's short-sighted effort put into extravagant set pieces- and not much else- gives the impression that Olympus would've worked better as a video game. The script is a dog's breakfast, as dialogue ranges from cringe-worthy to inexcusably awful, doing little to soften the body blow already dealt by a contrived set of characters and a plot with more holes than the poor, generic baddies unlucky enough to face Banning and his toys. Fuqua has not made a good film, per se, but one for the wrong generation. One can't help but think that Olympus- with its macho, take-no-prisoners lead and its blatant pushing of outwardly 'muhrican ideals- would've fit right in in the excessive yet carefree 1980s. But in a time where audiences are, dare we say, smarter, it is easy to get wrapped up in all the ways a film is wrong, rather than considering how much fun it was to watch all the wrongness unfold.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",Olympus Has Fallen

I really thought that, with such a high rating, it was going to be at least semi-decent.But... it turned out to be a soul-less movie with nothing much going for it.The special effects were pretty good, and so was the acting. I did not like Gerald Butler in this film, but the talented Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman were, as usual, excellent. Sadly, that does not alter the fact that this movie was an uninspired borefest. What a waste of good actors.A lot of the time it just felt like some lame shoot-em-up video game. This whole movie is a 1.5 hour long killing spree. People are just walking around shooting and killing other people. Not much else happens in this film.It was too violent for my liking. The constant mindless/meaningless violence scenes get boring after 5 minutes or so, and you can't be bothered to pay any attention anymore.Plus, there are too many plot holes (though there isn't much of a plot), and the whole thing feels incredibly unrealistic. There was no decent story behind this violent mess. And whatever there was - was unconvincing.I would've rated it 4 or 5 (out of 10), but it gets a 1 -- just try and bring down the current high rating, since, in my opinion, it's unjustified.",Olympus Has Fallen

It has so many unbelievable parts that you better shut down your brain and only consume the action.
The most unbelievable part is: The terrorist leader says that he don't want the codes for the atomic bombs....because of the kidnapping they would be changed.
And only a few minutes later he wants the codes for the desctruction of the bombs (as they wouldn't change anything that the president had access).
Not that a single man can kill dozens of terrorists while the all secret service agents with much younger and tougher agentes than old man Butler are killed in seconds is more plausible.

When it came to the point where Kang needed his code he already has it. How? How did Kang get his code? Movie magic! That's how! Logic is so stupid to be bothered with. When they bring up the phrase ""we do not negotiate with terrorists"" you just roll your eyes because you know that will. That policy is ignored when President Eckhart\Asher is held hostage. The most powerful military rolls over and plays dead as they cave in to every terrorist demand with ""no, no, no, no don't hurt our President! We'll even surrender our territory. How does California sound?"" That is right! A trillion dollar army brought to its knees by a crap C140. No president-no matter how good looking-is worth that.

178,azanti0029,"Better than Die Hard 5, worth seeing for the attack on the Whitehouse.",6,19 April 2013,"The first of two movies to come out this year involving a direct attack on the American seat of power, in this case in a somewhat timely fashion, its the Koreans who are behind it. Gerard 'the housewife's bit of rough' Butler, plays Mike Banning, a caring ex Secret Service agent, who failed to save the wife of the president in a motor vehicle accident. Banished from the white house to a desk in the treasury, he is nearby when Terrorists attack during a conference with South Korea. So far so Die Hard in the White House, and that's not a bad thing. Butler gets involved and soon its down to him to rescue the president, his son and save the day.The timing of this films release, while a coincidence could not be more apt, with North Korean rouge agents playing the bad guys. Let's be honest this film, is what it is. Escapist entertainment, if you're politics are too far to the left your probably not going to like it too much. The American jingoism will probably begin to grate. But as an action film and 100 minutes of fun, is it any good? Well yes and no. Many scenes are paint by numbers plot points so there's few awards for original dialogue here. The actors all do a good job, and Aaron Eckhart makes for a convincing Oval Office lead, with Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett lending gravitas as staunch suited military types who bark orders and debate the best course of action while Morgan requests his favourite coffee. Wings Hauser really makes his mark in a good supporting tole too. Butler however isn't given the quick fire lines to make this Die Hard clone quite as memorable. As an action hero he is convincing but less so as a witty charmer but with better dialogue who knows? Credit though for the action scenes, at least here you can see who is firing at who and tell who is shooting at what. The assault on the Whitehouse is well conceived, well shot and not entirely unbelievable and makes for a fantastic set piece, which will make the film earn its place in my DVD collection. But less convincing are the action sequences that follow in the dark corridors with Butler one on one. By comparison they seem a little uninspired and all seem to take place in the same set. I thought we would see firefights throughout places like the Whitehouse Kitchen, the West Wing where Butler would get creative with grenades in microwaves and such, but no such luck. Here our shoot outs are confined to a couple of corridor sets and could have been much better. There's more than a few friendly nods to die hard here and not all of them work.It's a good effort and fun if your not too picky, but I think Whitehouse Down will be the one to watch. And, oh yes, way way way better than Die Hard 5. At least here you could believe what your seeing in the world that have created on screen. When you break those rules, you loose your audience.",Olympus Has Fallen
179,jaxbubba,Die Hard Meets the White House!!!!!,7,31 March 2013,"I truly enjoyed this film; however, I could not get the image out of my head how much better this film could have been if this film had indeed been the premise for Die Hard 5. The ridiculous plot, the diabolical villain, and John McClane finessing his way through halls and hidden corridors of an enemy overrun White House this is the film avid Die Hard fans wanted ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" to be about!!! This film parallels Die Hard 1 in ever plot point imaginable; except there are no Barra bonds. However, would of's, should of's, could of's is not what this review is all about. So let's talk about ""Olympus Has Fallen"".Gerard Butler stars as Mike Banning, a former Secret Service agent / black ops ranger who's only interest is to one day return to duty protecting the President of the United States. As the Prime Minister of South Korea is visiting the White House, a planned strategic assault on the White House has been coordinated to coincide with the Prime Minister's arrival. Taken completely by surprised, the White House (Olympus) quickly falls into the hands of a ruthless North Korean assailant, Kang (played wonderfully by Rick Yune). Once the Secret Service realizes that the White House is under attack, they quickly hurry the President and Prime Minister to the President's protective bunker below the White House. Except there is a traitor amongst them, and the protective bunker now houses the three (3) key people needed to unlock the US arsenal of nuclear missiles and the madman who wants their access codes.Butler does a great job portraying the severely overwhelmed, over-matched would-be hero. One man against a super villain and his horde of minions with their endless supply of the most sophisticated weapons known on this planet (I bet even you think this sounds like a Die Hard film right about now) anyways I digress. My biggest complaint of this film has to be Aaron Eckhart as President Benjamin Asher. I'm afraid if I am one of only three people on the President's staff entrusted with keeping the codes to our nuclear stock pile in check, then I definitely feel that I would be willing to give my life to ensure that these codes never fell in the hands of a ruthless terrorist. However, as each of these people start the get tortured for their access codes President Asher caves in and orders them to give up their code (WHIMP). Even Mr. Takagi was able to take his access code to his grave in Die Hard 1, rather than give it up to the evil Hans Gruber, and he was only protecting Barra bonds.Anyways, this film is a real action adventure with plenty of guns, bullets, and explosions. Definitely your Saturday Matinée type movie with plenty of excitement to keep you entertained and amused. If you are an avid movie fan, you can even keep track of how many similarities you find between this film and Die Hard 1 or better yet make a comment on whether or not you agree/disagree if this would have been a better Die Hard 5 premise. Either way, this film is no thinking required, senseless, mind-numbing action adventure fun.See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel""",Olympus Has Fallen
180,adrongardner,Dumb Hard,1,31 March 2013,"The entire movie I kept waiting for Leslie Nielsen to show up. This has got to be a parody right?Olympus Has Fallen is the most blatant, and dumbest Die Hard scene for scene copy that has, or more likely, will ever be made. I don't know how security cameras, sub machine guns, rocket launchers or bunkers work, but I'm sure I know they don't work like they do in this movie. This is like a really bad cover to a great, iconic song. Same words, but man, is it painful to experience.Not only does every single actor in this movie talk with the Jack Bauer and Batman Begins gravel voice, I think this movie is racist and discriminatory too. Not even toward the Koreans, it's also downright Anti-American. Look, there's some dummies that come and go from all levels of our government, but this movie makes reality look pretty sweet because everybody in this one is freaking IQ flat lined. The FBIs Johnson and Johnson (no relation) at the Nakatomi building were smarter than anybody in this one. Did I mention how dumb this movie is? Don't you have to Arm a missile BEFORE you detonate it? Can you evacuate 30k US troops from the DMZ in 30 minutes? Or, you know the part where they send in the Navy SEALs knowing their own weaponry will cut these brave men down and the CSA, played by Robert Forrester for payday, refuses to call them back after 5/6 helos are smoking? Wait, these guys are probably still alive, they can get out of the chopper and get the job done...Nah, the movie lets them be dead for the sake of the script so Butler bad dude can go in there and clean house. Even though all his security codes should be revoked for the White House after 18 months reassigned. :( My head hurts.As an American, folks, I want to publicly apologize for this thing. Also, what the heck hit that first SUV at the beginning of the movie? I still have no idea what that was. But then there I go trying to think. Everything I've been taught to do, my entire life.

181,Svenstadt,"Much like Die Hard 2: A star who deserves better, and improbable plot elements.",4,5 November 2018,"This title pretty much says it all about this movie. Every action movie cliche in Hollywood is here. The only difference is, Gerard Butler is the strongest link in this film. He can cover his accent well enough, and add enough ""This is Sparta!!"" gutteral yawns into his voice to be a tough guy well enough. However, a major plot element seems, on the face of it, completely improbable. The villain overdoes his creepiness. The guy who plays the president is a good actor, and I enjoy everything Aaron Eckhart is in. Some of the CGI elements are, as always, cheesy. The shootout scenes are OK, but a little overdone. The cinematography is kind of sloppy, even in the sequel London Has Fallen. Morgan Freeman plays the situation-room VP. There is not enough natural action or dialogue, and too much 'go-here, go-there' pacing, which is annoying.",Olympus Has Fallen

183,dharmendrasingh,Preposterous paranoid propaganda. But fun!,6,28 May 2013,"Why not cut the pretence and call this film, 'We Hate North Korea'? That's really all this film is: a childish warning from the ever- paranoid US to the Hermit Kingdom to tone down its bravado. It's the kind of film George W. Bush would call a masterpiece. Aaron Eckhart stars as US President Benjamin Asher, who turns his back on his friend and trusted Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) because he saved him and not his wife in a fatal car accident. Banning is relegated to a desk job, which he hates because he's much more productive when executing people in as few moves as possible. Luckily for him, his pencil pushing doesn't last long, as the North Koreans turn rhetoric into radicalism by mounting a full-scale surprise attack on Washington DC.While a sophisticated fighter plane (which impressively blasts out a halo of rockets to defend itself against attack) causes mayhem from the sky, a well-ordered, precipitous assault takes place at ground level. Refuse trucks park in front of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and open fire on the gates. Citizens emerge out of panic-stricken crowds and detonate bombs to allow entry onto the lawn. Then a small army shoots its way into the White House to continue the carnage until the President and key members of his staff are captured. It takes just 15 minutes for the White House (codenamed Olympus) to fall.That sequence is the single most impressive part of Antoine Fuqua's paranoid propaganda piece. I never once questioned the plausibility of the attack because we've seen too much to question what's possible. What I did question was Mike Banning volunteering himself as essentially the only form of resistance against this unprecedented terror attack.Honestly, an invincible comic creation would take more care. Banning strolls into the White House amid a rampaging gun battle, totally oblivious to the prospect of a pointless death. I just thought he was arrogant.And then I fell asleep. When I awoke 30 minutes later, my wife kindly assured me that I had missed nothing of importance. Banning had moved from one wing to another, surreptitiously executing a few goons along the way, while Asher and co. were toyed with by Kang (Rick Yune), the head terrorist as he made impossible demands of Acting President, Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman).Never mind why Kang is putting himself out like this - it's preposterous. First timers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt wrote this hogwash. Is it a coincidence that their first names sound a bit like the word 'cretin'? Angela Bassett, Melissa Leo, Robert Forster and Dylan McDermott are reliable in their bit parts but why add to the production invoice? For those who won't sympathise with the President's plight, his son Conner is used as the secondary victim. He cleverly conceals himself in the White House walls, and Banning has to rescue him before he saves the world from being blown to pieces. As if he didn't have enough on his plate.",Olympus Has Fallen

185,julian-mumford,Popcorn fodder with a formulaic plot,6,25 September 2013,"Succinctly described as ""Die Hard"" in the White House, this is one of two movies on the same subject competing for your movie dollar. First out of the gate from Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day), and somewhat handicapped by a smaller budget, comes Gerard Butler as troubled Secret Service operative Mike Banning.Mike is having a bad run, following his rescue of the President but loss of the first lady in an earlier incident. Mike has been sidelined into the backwater of the Treasury department, albeit still armed to ensure those paper clips are kept in order.President Benjamin Asher is the loving husband, father and all round good guy, quite happy to box and spar with his security detail and look after his movie moppet son. Eighteen months later he has gone through the grieving process and is enmeshed in geo-politics which brings the South Korean president to the White House for talks.No sooner has tea been served, the bodies start to pile up, a colossal Hercules style aircraft starts mowing down security staff and civilians alike as it heads for ""the most secure building in the world"".As events progress the only man who can save the day is Mike Banning, handily trained by special forces before presumably moving to the Security service. The film is very much black and white, Americans good and decent and the enemy du jour very bad. On this occasion filling this role are North Korean (NK) sympathisers, again leavened by being labelled as a terrorist splinter group, just in case the NK cinematic demographic opens up.The film is unashamedly old fashioned with a cookie cutter story, there is little irony, humour or even awareness of similar films this attempts to emulate. In keeping with modern trends, the villains are more ruthless than usual, with TV style executions which probably seem tame for the Youtube generation.It would be easy to tick off the plot points, child in danger, shock killings to emphasise how ruthless the bad guys are, revenge taken by lone gunman against the odds, incompetent warmongering generals and a final rousing speech wrapped in the Star Spangled banner before the credits roll.Predictable yes, with workmanlike direction and brick by brick suspense building. There is nothing to distinguish this from many other films in a similar vein. Morgan Freeman as speaker Trumbull and Angela Bassett as Secret Service Director attempt to add some gravitas to limited effect.Freeman in particular is handicapped by weak dialogue and nonsensical decision making. One would hope someone in that position would have more moral fibre than is demonstrated here. Of course there is a movie Macguffin in the shape of some vague secret military doomsday process ""Cerberus"", which will usher in some doom laden scenario, that characters must strive to avoid.The effects are average, not the state of the art and the body count high and keeping the brutality relatively real has also impacted the films rating. Butler is average, adding no personality to the role, albeit adding another rather bland entry to his resume.Summary Popcorn fodder with a formulaic plot, fun whilst it lasts but instantly forgettable and adding nothing to the genre.""Die Hard in the White House"" does what it says on the tin but with minimal style and displaying no screen charisma or magic.",Olympus Has Fallen
186,tbmforclasstsar,Fun....but ridiculouly ridiculous...,4,25 March 2013,"WARNING: OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN IS MEANT FOR BAD ASSES. THEREFORE, THIS REVIEW (OBVIOUSLY) CONTAINS LANGUAGE.In the history of cinema, there have been plenty of films that demand that we stretch the realism of our real world. From sic-fi films such as Independence Day to Die Hard films that have one man taking out an incredible threat on his own, films love to stretch reality as far as they can. The new film Olympus Has Fallen may have stretched it the farthest I have seen in a very, very long time.Starring Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett, and Morgan Freeman, Olympus Has Fallen tells the story of a secret service agent (who had previously been on duty to protract the President, but was transferred after an accident in which the First Lady was killed) who must take out an entire North Korean terrorist cell that has successfully invaded the White House. That's right. The White House was successfully breached and the President has been taken hostage.But hold on to your dicks, because s*** talking agent Mike Banning (Butler) is here to save the god damn day. With nothing but instincts, a mean set of fighting skills, and a determination we only see from the real heroes like Rambo and John McClane, Banning is on a two-part mission: save the President and kill the son of a b**** that attacked the country he loves. Get out your sleeveless American flag t-shirts for this one, folks. Because f*** sleeves. Immense patriotism will be more than enough to keep you warm in any theater showing Olympus Has Fallen.So how did these a-holes take over the White House? I mean, this is the most secure building in the world. How could these guys get in? Well, simple. First they flew a giant air bomber right through restricted airspace, shooting down a few fighter jets trying to tell them to back off, and took out the military personnel on the roof of the White House. Simple. Then they bombed the gate surrounding the White House and drove in giant dump trucks heavily equipped with machine guns. All they needed was for every secret service member to come running unprotected out the front doors of the White House, which, obviously, they do. Then they had their leader ready on the inside, teamed up with a traitor secret service agent, so they can kidnap the President. Duh. Piece of cake. And all they had to do was have everything go quickly and perfectly without military interference. I'm honestly surprised this hasn't already happened in real life.

But if you do, this film is a pure delight. It is essentially at ""Cat and Mouse Game"" featuring disgraced Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), versus Korean Terrorist Kang (Rick Yune), with the fate of President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), and perhaps the entire World at stake. We have seen inspirations for this film before"" ""Air Force One"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", ""Executive Decision"", ""Invasion USA"", ""Independence Day"", ""Under Siege"", and ""Die Hard"" to name a few, but what makes it different is: 1: The motivation of the Terrorists, which is to basically hand a victory to North Korea, by getting the US out of the Korean DMZ, and to have Nuclear Weapons explode in their silos (essentially turning the United States into rubble). Usually, these films have Aliens, Arabs, Greedy Individuals, Germans or Russians as the enemy, this time it is the Korean (who might give Bane (from ""Dark Night Rises""), a run for his money as being the most evil villain of recent years). 2: This film is not a watered down PC oops PG film, afraid of showing what evil is all about, and making bad guys look somewhat sympathetic, and (or) giving them a nasty sense of humor or a hot girlfriend to take the edge off what they are: Evil people with nothing redeeming about them. These guys are cold blooded murderers who thought nothing of killing people (even their own allies are not immune: Spoilers Ahead:(like when the helicopter blew up, killing terrorists and hostages alike)), so seeing Banning hunt them down like the dogs they are (understanding they cannot be allowed to win no matter what), and sending them straight to Hell for their actions (it does not matter if it was with a gun, or hand to hand combat, or finally shoving a knife in Kang's brain (as he promised to do), is something you can enjoy (just like when Banning and a wounded President Asher walk out of the White House as victors, and the Nation is saved (no stretchers here), and Asher gives a great speech at the end of the film that reminds me of the ""Independence Day"" speech of President Whitmore (Bill Pullman).

189,Ishallwearpurple,An elderly female likes the action and Butler---,8,24 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen (2013) Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckard, Angela Bassett, Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, Melissa Leo, Dylan McDermott, Rick Yune. Non-stop action and graphic violence means heart pounding thrills. The beginning sets up the First Family as loving parents to their young son, who is buddies with head Secret Service agent Mike Banning. So instead of Mike being in the car with the President, Mike goes in the car with Conner, the boy, who asks if he can. A horrible accident on the way from Camp David to the White House causes a death and Mike is blamed so is reassigned to desk work at the Treasury Dept. So when the attack on D.C. and the White House comes, Mike runs amid the chaos to the W.H. and by the time he gets there he is able to enter and find out the who, what, where of the people who have taken over the building. Since he has worked there and knows all the secret communications and passages, he is able to talk to the command center and those left in charge. He works his way toward the 'safe bunker' where the villains have set up shop and listed their demands. The scenes where he has to fight and kill his way toward his objective are graphic and bloody, but make you gasp and at times exclaim. Like other thrillers - Taken, for example - one extremely well trained guy is able to do the impossible. I am an older woman and I enjoyed the film and seeing Butler in action. The whole cast is very good, especially the three women in roles of importance to the story. 8/10",Olympus Has Fallen
190,CowherPowerForever,Get me some coffee. Half and half. Three sweet'n lows. In a real cup. Not one of those paper or Styrofoam things.,8,27 December 2014,"Olympus Has Fallen is an intense action thriller that will keep you interested from start to finish. With so much action and even some good acting, this film shouldn't fly over anyone's radar. The film suffers in only one major aspect, and that is the special effects. The CG is quite bad in this film. While this can distract some people over the course of a film, I'm the type of person who doesn't really get bothered by it all that much. The following is my review of Olympus Has Fallen.The film was written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. Both of whom worked on the recent Expendable 3 film. Olympus Has Fallen was their first writing effort, and the effort was not bad in my opinion. The story follows Mike Banning, a former secret service agent, as he tries to stop the terrorist attack from happening. Since he was in the secret service he of course knows the White House, and is tasked with fighting off these terrorists to then save the President. The story is fairly simple, and up until the recent real life scares at the White House, I thought this idea was ludicrous. While it still might be after all, the writers do a well enough job to get us to buy into it.The film was directed by one of the better directors of today, Antoine Fuqua who is well know for Training Day and the recent hit The Equalizer. There is so much action in this film, and this is an area where Fuqua really shines. About twenty minutes of the first forty is pure high octane action. While the action slows down after that, it still is a nice slow burn until the ending. With some nice tactical kills and amazing hand to hand combat action, there surely isn't anything boring about this film. The bigger action scenes have CG that looks pretty generic, and this could be a big turn off for some viewers. It is just not a few scenes either, there are many bad CG scenes in this film. Minus the bad CG in this film, director Antonie Fuqua does a fantastic job with this film.The star of the film is Gerard Butler with a surrounding cast with such actors like Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Dylan McDermott, Cole Hauser and Angela Bassett. While there is nothing award winning in terms of acting in this film, the effort is very good. Butler is able to deliver a great performance as the hero of the film and we all know Morgan Freeman is always a joy to watch. In a movie like this, most people only come for the action, however in this film the acting is good as well.The film was composed by Trevor Morris who is more known for scoring smaller action films. I enjoy his score on this film, but it is nothing special. It of course adds some nice depth to the overall feel of the film, but it is not an effort I will be remembering down the road.Overall, if you are in the mood for a fun action film that is not really boring at all, this is the film for you. The only downside is some cheap CG used in the bigger action scenes. Other than that, this is a must see film for fans of the genre.I will be going over the Blu-Ray special features as well. This home video release features 4 featurettes and a blooper real. I'm disappointed in the overall special features. The longest running feature on this release is only eleven minutes long. Most of the featurettes run at four minutes or less. I know the film wasn't suppose to be a giant success like it was, but well, it was, and the fact there still is not more special features is sad. The film is great and a must own, but watch how much you pay for it.8/10",Olympus Has Fallen
191,rebecca-ry,A less awesome Die Hard meets a less awesome Team America,7,7 May 2013,"'Olympus Has Fallen' stars Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart. North Korea infiltrates the White House and takes several hostages including the President.It's not difficult to see where people have made the connection between this film and Die Hard. Some things here almost mimic it! From scenes where Mike Banning (Butler) and Kang are exchanging threats via remote or the scene where Mike is hurt and talking to the stand-in President (Freeman) telling him that he is alright. These scenes provide some unintentional comic relief – as do the vomit inducing patriotic scenes which I like to refer to as 'Americuuh! F**k yeah' scenes. The action is really what saves this film. It is thoroughly entertaining, quite violent and sometimes shocking. I'm not sure if anyone else has noticed that the CGI is quite cheap looking; the jets, helicopters and large guns look almost cartoon-like. I don't think this film was released in 3D at any point and the film looks like it would have a fairly large budget so I don't understand why the CGI was so bad but it was quite distracting. When it comes to acting, Gerard Butler should definitely stick to action films; it's where he is best. Aaron Eckhart gives a decent performance as the President and actually suits the role really well. Overall, the plot is pretty dumb; it's sometimes too stupid to even comprehend and it is of course extremely far-fetched but the action is pretty good and really entertaining. It won't become a modern classic like Die Hard but it is a good film to watch with friends.",Olympus Has Fallen
192,drew_atreides,Few films are as dumb as this one...,5,23 March 2013,"...the producers and studio were wise not to advertise that this was another ANTOINE FUQUA film.... Had i known this going in i probably never would have bought a ticket... However, as the film faded to black, and i saw ""DIRECTED BY.... Antoine Fuqua"" i groaned out loud and shook my fist. Next time, Fuqua, NEXT TIME!!! I cannot believe that both Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman signed on for this garbage. I can only assume they needed the paycheque. Eckhart, to this point, had never let me down. Shame on you, Aaron!Gerard Butler...Boy there's a guy who really hasn't had a real winners since ""300"", eh? He really hams it up as Captain America-meets-John McClane... I guess he gives it the old college try but i don't think ANYONE could deliver those forced, wannabe-badass lines with a straight face. Don't get me started on the casting. Dylan Mcdermott? On what planet is Dylan McDermott ANY sort of imposing action figure?I give this movie a 5 (rather then the 3 i want to give to it) for Melissa Leo's performance. Never thought i'd see the day where i say something akin to ""Melissa Leo steals this movie"", but she really does.I understand the concept of the mindless action movie, i really do. But a real GOOD mindless action movie doesn't openly present plot holes a mile-wide that just stand there and scream at you!This movie was truly, truly awful. You've done it again, Antoine! Curse you.",Olympus Has Fallen
193,jimlacy2003,The cliché has risen,7,30 June 2013,"This movie was pretty much what I expected, which was a good thing. I knew it was going to be an action movie, and it delivered.In the opening for a brief moment I basked in the fantasy of having a real human being for a president that actually had a backbone. Too good!Loved when the action started happening. Humm.. what would happen if crazed lunatics got their hands on a gunship loaded wall to wall with chain guns and opened them up on innocent civilians? Great special effects, plenty of over the top violence, blood, occasional dismemberment et al. What you would expect really.Yes there are a lot of ""what the heck moments"". Like how did this gun ship just come out of nowhere and show up just miles from the capital building? No explanation given, none needed.Yes, like 90% of the movie was a mishmosh grab bag full of stereotypes and clichés. It was like ""Independence day"" meets ""Die Hard"", plus Under Siege"", and, you get the idea.Plus either intentionally or by accident it had lot of humor. The portrayal of our government was just down right laughable. In particular Morgan Freeman went on national TV to say: ""our government remains 100% functional."" I turned to look at my wife, did he mean to say ""SNAFU, our government is fully dysfunctional as usual.""? The irony of our government as shown was so thick and sharp it was cutting me.In the end you can't take a movie like this too seriously. It was just seriously entertaining fun!",Olympus Has Fallen
194,Macleanie,Fuelled thrill ride,7,18 June 2019,"It has its cheesy lines and predictable moments but this is a brilliant thriller. Action is plentiful and there is a great pace throughout, fuelled thrill ride. It has an air of the original Die Hard about it, man stuck in a building with terrorist holding people hostage, but he's the only hope as authorities on the outside are helpless. I did really enjoy this movie and although it was entertaining from start to finish, it did have a moments where I cringed a little. This storyline has been done over which takes away some of the likability and it is way too patriotic though expected to be. Although I rate Gerard Butler I did find him to be a little overzealous in his role.",Olympus Has Fallen
195,s_campanale,Tonight the part of Steven Seagal will be played by Gerard Butler....Everything else is unchanged.,8,18 April 2013,"In these cash strapped times, studios are playing it safe, dusting off mouldering old un-filmed genre scripts from decades past and shooting them quick and cheap with winning actors in order to make a good return on little investment.A perfect example is ""Olympus has fallen"", a Steven Seagal movie from circa 1994 that never got made, now finally surfacing with Gerard Butler no less playing Seagal, whom the intervening years have made too old and too portly to be taken seriously. The premise (shared by bigger budget rival White House Down) is the ultimate ""Die Hard"" spin off, a terrorist attack and takeover of THE WHITE HOUSE itself! The villains this time are North Koreans who want to get the US out and re-unite the Peninsula under Communist control (as well as wiping the USA out by blowing up all their nuclear missiles inside their silos!) but the hero is still a troubled ex-special forces superman with bad memories to get over who finds himself at the wrong place at the wrong time and takes down the baddies one by one till he gets to the head villain and stops Armageddon with just seconds on the clock (3 in this case) all the while communicating with the impotent commanders in their bunker as they coordinate badly planned attacks that are bloodily repulsed by the smiling villains as our boys and girls die in slow motion to tragic music and generals beat their fists and bite their lips. The hero will be utterly redeemed by the end and flags will be waved, speeches made and decorations given.There is nothing remotely original about this film, and that is the whole point! It's MEANT to be cheesy and dumb! Seagal had a sort of irony deficit which caused him to play even the most ludicrous and idiotic scenario 100% straight with an earnestness that made them unintentional comedy gold (culminating in the surreal ""Fire Down Below"" which effectively destroyed his cinema career). Antoine Fuqua however KNOWS this is all sheet, and presents the cheese with a knowing wink, letting us in on the joke. It works because it brought back those glory days of sitting in the local fleapit watching ""Under Siege"" and ""Marked for Death"", and the capacity audience (full house on opening night) were loving it and cheering along.Gerard Butler, a romantic comedy actor whose greatest fame is still as King Leonidas in the gloriously OTT fascistic epic ""300"", makes a good replacement Seagal. He almost never smiles and has that same gruff, serious look about him, even when delivering absurd dialogue and supposedly dramatic scenes. He even fights like Seagal, with that close quarters military style combat complete with slashing knives, usually ending up pushed into an enemy's head, chest, or throat. This may be a new career path for him, the new Steven Segal! A place in a future ""Expendables"" must surely beckon now.The rest of the cast is filled with famous faces doing very little for the money, not least a second cameo (after Oblivion) for Morgan Freeman as the speaker who becomes acting President, a character whose impotence is matched only by the utter indifference of the actor playing him. Angela Basset plays her umpteenth authority figure as Butler's boss, while Robert Forester is saddled with the over-eager gung-ho general character. They spend the whole movie in the command centre watching things play out, making lousy decisions and getting lectured by Butler over the intercom. In the White House itself, Aaron Eckhart plays the Harvey Dent-ish boy scout president, and tries to act a little despite the absurdity, while Melissa Leo, the defence secretary sporting the world's least flattering hairdo, shouts, screams, fights, kicks and gets beaten up in a scene that's meant to be shocking yet is as laughable as the rest. No sexy sidekick for Butler here alas, but he does have Radha Mitchell as his saintly Doctor girlfriend who watches from afar while curing the afflicted, and Ashley Judd appears as the saintly first lady who dies in the ludicrous icy river bridge crash at the start. The terrorists are all North Korean commandos (or something similar. The film tries to avoid directly pointing the finger at them while actually still doing it anyway) and besides the foxy girl hacking the computer, have none of the personality or diversity of the mercenaries in the original movies. Their leader and main villain is played by Rick Yune, who is effectively reprising his role as Zao, the North Korean terrorist trying to bring about a re-unification under Communist control using a super weapon and blackmail, from 2002s unloved 007 ""Die Another Day"". This follows the same cosmic coincidence of Wil Yun Lee turning up as a cocky North Korean colonel in ""Red Dawn"", which means that either Hollywood casting agents are very unimaginative (""North Korean villains? How about that guy from Die Another Day?"") or they are doomed to play the same roles for all eternity as some terrible punishment for that movie.The flag waving nationalism is part of the course – Every country's action movies do it so why shouldn't the USA? The production values are gloriously cheap, from the cardboard model White House to the PC game level CGI helicopters and missiles, to the crummy sets and poor lighting. The profanity riven dialogue is deliberately idiotic, as are the constant threats, pissing contests, and angry defiance of the various characters, not to mention the logical chasms of Hercules gunships strafing Washington and armoured garbage trucks taking out the White House security. It is these things which make this kind of movie so appealing as a guilty pleasure, and its why ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is proving such a big hit.Let us hope ""White House Down"" doesn't fail by forgetting what it is meant to be.",Olympus Has Fallen
196,The_Celluloid_Sage,Die Hard (slowly) in the white House,5,6 April 2020,"After an accident one cold and snowy night which forced him into saving the president (Eckhart) over the presidents wife, Mike Banning (Butler) is now assigned to a desk job just outside the whitehouse, instead of being the presidents personal bodyguard. A career professional he looks on out of the window with perhaps a little regret while still doing his government duties. Meanwhile in a ridiculous scene where an enemy plane manages to get far to close to where it wants to be (and after dealing with two military jets) the bad guys are on their way to the whitehouse.On the Whitehouse lawn all hell breaks loose as the terrorists manage to gun down special agents and blow up various things before forcing their way into the building (killing more people en-route). While on the phone to his wife, Banning notices this and jumps into action as the one-man army we naturally assume he is and manages to sneak inside before the building is shut down. How convenient. even more convenient is that all his security codes still work even though he longer works there. Lucky break eh?As far as Die Hard type films go, this is one of the dumber ones I ever had the misfortune to view. The plot is ridiculous, the scenes are even more ridiculous and some of the 'plot conveniences' are right out there in the dumb as hell stakes. Anyway, as one can guess Banning systematically makes his way through secret chambers, holes in walls and various other 'no one knows about places' in order to rescue people, dispatch with bad guys and eventually get the president.Now, as far as turn-your-brain-off-at-the-door films go, this is average stuff and should satisfy your typical patriotic, below average intelligence, cousin liking testoserone filled male. As for anyone else, I'd preobably recommend just watching the first Die Hard again for the fifty eigth time instead. Trust me, you'll have much more fun. The CGI here is average at best with a script which is perhaps even worse. The single saving grace to this mess is the acting, and that is saying something.Stereotypical bad guys, dumb good guys, ridiculous scenarios, and a daft plot. Not much else to say really except that Fuqua pulled of a master-stroke with this rubbish. He really has dropped a few talent points though compared to his earlier impressive work. What makes all this even funnier is that generally this film actually tries to take itself seriously and fails at every imaginable level possible. How this even made money and garned the ratings it did is beyond me.To sum up, if you're looking for a fast-paced action flick which rarely lets up and you don't mind your intelligence level dropping somewhat while watching it then this may be for you. Otherwise, stick to White House Down (Far superior film) or Die Hard, which while silly itself at times, still holds the bar for one of the better types of normal guy saves the day kind of films. As for Butler, he's a bankable actor, but he really should stay away from this kind of stuff now and stick to the romantic comedies.

197,moviescoundrel,What Die Hard 5 should have been....,8,27 March 2013,"This movie was pretty suspenseful from the beginning. It is basically Die Hard in the White House. Would Bruce Willis have done just as good of a job? Probably, but we'll never know. The action is intense including gun fights, explosions, stabbings, head shots, did I say stabbings? Mike Banning likes to kill bad guys, and he usually chooses to shoot them in the head or stab them. For me at least, it never got old. There of course are predictable parts, and this pieces together like the other movies from this type of hostage/takeover drama, but it seemed to work, take itself seriously at times, but many times, not too seriously. There are cheesy moments with the action and some typical plot holes, but at 2 hrs, I'm sure Fuqua was just trying to simplify it. Many of the scenes with the president felt legit and characteristic of a stand-up guy in his position.Check out www.moviescoundrel.com for more",Olympus Has Fallen

199,sohansurag,Fuqua's Mid Life Crisis Movie!,6,4 April 2013,"While Olympus Has Fallen isn't something we haven't seen before it offers a brisk pace and a little fresh take on the 'save the president' action genre. It did feel more like Die Hard 5 than the original Good Day to Die Hard replacing Bruce Willis with Gerard Butler of course. It has a striking resemblance with Roland Emmerich's upcoming White House Down starring Channing Tatum. It'd be only justifiable when I see it coz putting these 2 head to head is a bad idea considering both has identical plots, both are from reputable directors and both stars 2 of my favorite leads.We've seen Aaron Eckhart as a Spokesman in Thank you For Smoking and a District attorney in The Dark Knight and while he mixes the efforts in his role as the President he still comes off as a bit unconvincing. In a particular scene I expected him to scream ""RachelRachel"", the memories from The Dark Knight still etched in my mind. Of the lot Morgan Freeman role was reduced to a few minutes in the movie. The movie is owned by Gerard Butler as he got a welcome break from the disastrous chick flicks and rom coms that he was in. The return to his action roots is appreciable and he does deliver a strong performance sorta playing it off a very McClane-ish role. Dylan McDermott? Less said the better, there was no explanation or a backstory as to why his role behaved so. Rick Yune plays what he does besta formidable Korean antagonist.Gore is one thing I loved and the action promises plenty of gore hence making the whole affair more visceral unlike the recent PG13 G.I.Joe Retaliation. Still, given the director's previous films Olympus Has Fallen felt like lackluster. Olympus Has Fallen, compared to Fuqua's own Academy Award winning Training Day, is just a mindless action flick which promises a few nail-biting sequences.",Olympus Has Fallen
200,RoboRabbit89,One cool action flick.,7,12 October 2017,"Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckartt are superb in""Olympus Has Fallen.""Let me start by saying that this is a good action movie. It reminds me of the action movies from the '80's and '90's, with it's adrenaline pumping suspenseful opening to it's nail biting finish, this movie delivers.This may contain some spoilers.Mike banning is a secret service agent, part of the United States President's detail.But after Mike fails to save a loved one,he is demoted to desk duty. But now that's all about to change, one year later the white house is soon under attack by terrorist, killing all the service agents and it's up to Mike to save the day and take out the trash.The action scenes are spectacular, and it's nice to see an action movie with some character development.Morgan Freeman was good as Vice President Trumble, all his scenes are mostly in the Pentagon, but he was great.Aaron Eckartt was also good as the President, he didn't do very much because he was tied up for most of the movie but he was still good.Gerard Butler is very good as Mike Banning the hero of the film, it's great to see him kick ass in this, all his fight scenes and funny one liners were spot on.Ashley Judd has a very small roll in this as the President's wife but even though her part was small I liked her scenes.This film is directed well by Antwone Fuqua probably his best next to The Equalizer, He just did a damn good job.Rick Yune is great as the main baddie of the film, I haven't seen him in very much but this by far is his best work yet.Overall I very much enjoyed it, and I own it on DVD, and it's sequel, London Has Fallen is just as awesome.If your an action movie fan I think you'll probably like it.

After 9/11 would it really take so long to bring down the assault plane? Was it really necessary to make the crumbling of the Washington Monument a copy of the collapse of the towers? Should not the seal attack be called off after seeing what they were up against? As for the hostages, the only politician to earn my respect was Melissa Leo's Secretary McMillan, despite her over the top recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, comes across as serious and dedicated, unlike the President. I know there's not much review as criticism here, but this is one of the few films that I couldn't get over the stupidity of some plot points.",Olympus Has Fallen
202,DunkelheitVZ,shortest summary for your reading pleasure,5,17 February 2014,"Let us get the rating done first: 5 - average, at best why? 1. worst special effects in a blockbuster movie... even the car accident looked like an advertisement for old - fashioned technology. This really killed my immersion as a viewer.2. you can see every twist coming from a mile away 3. in films like this, I am looking forward to the intelligence behind the plan.... in this movie, there was none. Brute forcing their way and getting some shady looking people together with the president to get this done from the inside, which is totally against protocol? Really? I could go on, but since this is only an average movie, I stop here.If you just want some brainless entertainment for an evening, the movie is OK.

This is true, but as an audience I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.The best thing about this movie is its pace. You won't know how fast the 110 minutes go. There's not a minute you feel bored. The attack sequences are bit over the top, but if you are a drama lover, you won't be disappointed. The storyline isn't much to think about but the screenplay is apt. Its a good thing that the director Antonie Fuqua keeps things simple, doesn't dig too much into the conspiracy stuff and also doesn't include any unnecessary twists.Gerard Butler does what he does best, fight bad guys. Aaron Eckhart as the stern faced president reminds you of Harvey Dent. Morgan Freeman probably is there to strengthen the star value in the film. But its the villain Rick Yune with his evil smile who impresses.This is an out and out entertainer, don't think too much, just be in the moment and watch this movie.",Olympus Has Fallen

A well-organized, well-equipped, and well-informed terrorist group takes over the White House and take the POTUS and a large part of his essential personnel hostage. The baddies are North Koreans intent on taking possession of South Korea and nuking the US back to the Stone Age. Aiding them is an American traitor. Other than money and a chance at the good life what would motivate such a slug. The sole good guy on the premises is a disgraced former agent who cleans the bad guys' clocks.

Butler shoots, stabs, tortures and neck snaps his way to the bad guy's lair, delivering a cool monologue on what he intends to do to Kang to boot, and the action is mercifully R-rated, with it basically being chock full of gritty and at times wince inducing violence as well as having a pretty damn impressive looking all out assault on The White House itself. Does it have plot holes? Hellz yes, it's one of the many awesome things about it. Is it brainless? It's more Brainless than Jersey Shore. Again, one of the many awesome things about it. Is it jingoistic and low brow nationalistic? It would rival the likes of The Delta Force, Death Before Dishonour, Invasion USA or any Golan Globus production, circa 1980s in sheer, breast beating flag waving fervour. I'm not even American and even I was shouting ""God Bless America!"" at the end of this flick. So basicaslly anyone looking for a sober examination of US foreign policy should avoid this one and watch Syriana instead. It has a paunchy George Clooney with a beard as well as a badass mark Strong.However anyone who really just wishes to see Gerard Butler acting all heroic while delivering the action goodies in a decidedly R-rated manner, then Olympus Has Fallen is a more than adequate time filler and should definitely satisfy. 8/10, loud, vacuous dumb and a whole lotta fun.And whoever played Mike Banning's wife had the easiest pay cheque on Earth.",Olympus Has Fallen
206,TheMovonka,Gerard Butler never negotiates with terrorists...,6,18 June 2013,"As it seems to be trendy to conquer the White House cinematically this summer, ""Olympus has fallen"" tries to present the unpleasant scenario superficially and action packed.While CIA security expert Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler, has to suffer from being displaced as the main protector of the US president, North Korean invaders attack ""Olympus"", take the president hostage and threat the whole nation with the use of its atomic weaponry. Career and patriotism driven, Mike Banning tries to reclaim the White House, eliminate the threat and rescue his friend and leader of the western world.So far, so uninspired. As easy the story sounds, actually it is much more trivial. In the dust of mediocre special effects arises a movie which entertains with the fact to be full of action and un-whitewashed brutality. Ignoring every logical aspect of how to enter the heart of a city with a fully armored airplane, the fact that the US-helicopters are slower than garbage trucks and a perfectly equipped special North Korean army, outnumbering local security, can move freely within Washington, this movie is the perfect popcorn cinema event for action lovers and US-fanatics. While patriotism hits the audience with full tilt, Gerard Butler hits the invaders brutally and effectively. Nice fight scenes and his believable strategy distract from his luck that the squatters only attack in very small groups.To sum up, when the US flag is perforated and the Washington monument is destroyed, the audience watches the bloody ""one man rescue show"" with pleasure to see how the enemy is brought to justice. In the end, as long as you have switched off your brain, you saw a nearly classic action movie. So let me end with the sentence I heard several times during this movie. God bless those trivial movies and God bless the USA.",Olympus Has Fallen
207,capelladewdrop,No interesting plot twists,7,29 July 2015,"From the moment he disabled the White House security cameras, I just knew Agent Banning would lead a one man assault and retake the white house despite the dozens of secret service agents being taken down by the terrorists and then this movie became boring and predictable. He stopped every nuclear missile in the USA going off at the same time with only 3 seconds remaining (surprise surprise).I credit the CGI and the action scenes in this movie, but I doubt terrorists would really try to take The White House it's just not a target of huge importance. Other than the fear it would cause I doubt you would gain any major tactical advantage against the USA and the loss of life suffered trying to do it would just not be worth it.Now if it was about taking over Area 51 or the Pentagon, that would be interesting. 'It's only the white house' is what has put me off watching this movie for such a long time.I also think this movie could've been 90 minutes long instead of feature-length.",Olympus Has Fallen
208,culmo80,"Eh, Not Bad for an Action Movie",6,19 August 2013,"Entertaining but predictable.I like action movies, but I also can only suspend my disbelief for so long and in so many ways.First, this movie is your typical action film with thin characters, lots of shooting, lots of fighting, and lots of explosions. In that, its enjoyable. Gerard Butler is a decent action star who is believable as the tough guy who saves the day. Morgan Freeman was rather flat...he pretty much just mailed in his performance in this one. Aaron Eckhart is good in the role, even though the President in this film is somewhat one-dimensional. There is absolutely zero character development in this film. There really is no conflict between Butler and Eckhart's characters, even though that is exactly what is built up in the first 15 minutes or so. Similarly, the conflict between Butler and his wife is simply there for filler and does not feel authentic. The rest of the plot (and spoilers are below) is predictable and full of holes.For one, okay, Butler got reassigned to a desk job at Treasury...which apparently requires a pistol and extra magazines. Right.Assuming the North Koreans got an AC-130 gunship into the United States...where would they launch it from? And in the post-9/11 world, no aircraft would get that close with only 2 fighters intercepting it. Certainly not an aircraft of that size. Also, when fighters intercept a plane, one flies alongside to get visual with the pilot, while another fighter trails behind, so as to take out the bogey should it display hostile actions. Anyway, the AC-130 scene was just a harbinger of things to come.So a massive ground attack on the White House happens with a small group of North Koreans overtaking the Secret Service. So...where were the Marines? I didn't see one Marine at all. And to even get a truck that close to the White House, you'd need to go through a check-point that has physical barriers that can't just be plowed over...so the dump trucks, buses and armored cars would have been stopped cold on 17th or 15th street...causing a traffic jam.But nobody gets in the White House with a weapon...not a visitor, not the security detail of a foreign dignitary. The Koreans wouldn't have made it into the bunker with weapons - and they wouldn't have made it in the bunker period, despite the President wanting them in there.The rest of the movie is predictable. Butler kills off the Koreans one by one, the Koreans do bad things, the Pentagon is hapless in trying to resolve the situation, and the President goes from being tough with the Koreans to giving in.In the end, everything is resolved with the Koreans dead and the President okay. What's not resolved is the near-state of war that was brewing on the Korean peninsula. Oh, and there's no way you can ""recall"" 20,000 soldiers with all their equipment. A draw down of that size would take at least 90 days. Anyway...its a fun movie if you can turn your brain off. I did laugh at several points, mostly because what I was seeing was so unbelievable.",Olympus Has Fallen
209,billcarr31,Seriously?,2,16 May 2019,"Everything that can be said critically about this nonsense has been said, but the basic premise that the USA would withdraw all its forces which have helped
preserve the nation of S Korea from the megalomaniacs in the North for over half a century, just save the life of POTUS. What about the millions of lives that would be lost in South Korea???
Not to mention the Navy Seals and 8 helicopters thrown away in the misguided attempt to retake the WH. Absolutely not!",Olympus Has Fallen
210,DubhDoo,Surprisingly dull and desperately in need of a sense of fun,4,26 April 2013,"'Team America: World Police' was a terrific film because of how it so cleverly satirised America's never quenching thirst for ridiculously patriotic movies that often verge on propaganda. Antoine Fuqua's stateside smash is sort of like Matt Stone and Trey Parker's puppet comedy, albeit without any of the irony. 'Olympus Has Fallen' is predictably flag-waving, but so unrelentingly straight-faced that it becomes wearisome and even tedious in places. There are constant shots of the American flag (it's even incorporated into the opening titles); shots of past presidents are shoehorned in whenever possible (at one point Gerard Butler ironically kills someone with a bust of Abraham Lincoln); and of course, we are given a groan-inducing speech that would undoubtedly stir viewers stateside. In the film's opening, former secret- service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, a fine screen presence) fails to save the wife (Ashley Judd) of the President (Aaron Eckhart) as her limo slides off an icy bridge. 18 months later, Banning, still haunted by the incident, is working at the treasury department, when North Korean terrorists attack the White House in an overblown CGI assault and take the President as a hostage. It's then up to Banning to fight his way through the White House and save the day. In a recent interview, Gerard Butler commented that between 'Olympus Has Fallen' and Roland Emmerich's similar US attack movie 'White House Down', his movie is ""the more realistic and authentic one"", which remains a statement difficult to swallow after the sheer OTT daftness of the action and unintentionally funny lines of dialogue. The Koreans are portrayed are entirely dastardly villains walking around with nuclear weapons, who must be killed on sight. The action isn't particularly entertaining (aside from the initial assault), quickly becoming repetitive and with surprisingly shoddy CGI for $70 million dollar actioner. This is the type of movie that could be enjoyed as a comedy or good ol' B-movie, if it wasn't so serious about its self-patriotism. Fuqua's direction is workmanlike; Butler makes a likable action hero, Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart appears to have attended the Joey Tribbiani School of acting, as he uses flared nostrils to signify great anger. It is essentially - as so many have said – ""'Die Hard' in the White House"". But at least 'Die Hard' didn't suffer from a humour bypass.",Olympus Has Fallen
211,hazysistersunshine33,Just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride.,7,3 July 2014,"Gerard Butler is an ex CIA agent who happens to be near the White House when terrorists take it over. It's up to him to save the day. It's Die Hard in the White House pretty much and Butler is just as bad ass as Bruce Willis and almost as funny. It's incredibly violent and over the top and just completely ridiculous. None of this would ever happen. Like, they would never take the president to the same bunker as guests from other countries. Those people would go to a different safe room. Still, as unbelievable as the plot is, it sure was a fun movie. It was a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end. Aaron Eckert plays the president and he is pretty tough too. If fact everyone is tough in it, even the female secretary of state who really takes a beating from the terrorists. A lot of people take a good beating on both sides. The White House takes a good beating too. Good beatings all around! You may be surprised by a few twists and details in this, but the general story is pretty easy to predict and follow. I don't think that will get in the way of enjoying it. Just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride.",Olympus Has Fallen
212,villard,Mission Impossible,3,22 September 2013,"If you are in the mood for a razzle-dazzle action thriller that pits terrorists against good old American blood and guts ballsy fighting, this is a flick for you. The nonstop carnage may be too much for the tastes of some viewers.But the excesses the director goes through to make a riveting tale turn the film into a comic book fantasy rather than something more chillingly plausible as the film version of Tom Clancy's ""The Sum of All Fears.""The biggest bloopers:1. Foreign nationals would never be admitted into the White House bunker during an attack on the U.S. (center to the film's plot)2. The nuclear warheads on an intercontinental missile do not explode if the missile self-destructs. 3. In the post-9/11 age I imagine the U.S Capitol has far more robust surface-to-air defenses than the film imaignes.4. How do terrorists hijack a large Air Force gunship without it being shot down immediately? (never explained in the film).5. There is no way to cut off all power and communications to the White House to leave the occupying terrorists blind and deaf?6. I doubt that the President, V.P., and a cabinet member have to memorize any military codes for nuclear missile control. I have a hard enough time memorizing my computer passwords!7. Camp David is in western Maryland; the nearest fund-raiser would be a 2-hour drive (in the dark of a stormy night?) -- unless the President was going to a fire hall spaghetti dinner in a rural town.Yes, most good stories require some artistic license, but this film crosses a red line that makes the terrorist attack scenario so far-fetched that it's nothing to worry about. Little green Martians would be more likely to show up on the White House lawn first.",Olympus Has Fallen
213,jcallows,surprisingly good,9,24 March 2013,"This film was surprisingly good. It's been a while since I've seen such an enjoyable action film like this one. Actually, I've been starving for one for quite some time. So much so that after being disappointed by crap like the first two Expendables, the Transformers sequels, the Total Recall remake, etc., I wanted to give this a 10. Of course, this film wasn't perfect but was still a very enjoyable film.As others have said, this was basically a Die Hard film in the White House. Actually, this should've been another Die Hard film. But don't hold this against it. It was very well done. In fact, it was better than some of the Die Hard movies themselves.The strengths of this film were the action (of course), the cast, the character development and the story. The action was graphic and realistic, the cast featured quality actors, the characters had enough depth to make us care about them and the story (though not original) did add more weight to the importance of what the protagonist needed to do. Add this all up and you had a film that had enough emotional impact to make you care about what happened, unlike many recent action films that seemed more like mindless video games than movies.What I really like was the depiction of the bad guys. They were clearly bad and proved they were not messing around. Repeatedly. It's just one more reason for you to pull for the good guy.Like many action films, this one wasn't very original. But what separated this from the others was that it was well executed and there were just so many things going for it that it didn't matter. Watch the Expendables and you'll appreciate this a lot more. This was one of the better action films in recent years.",Olympus Has Fallen
214,TakeUpReel,"Yippee-ki-yay, MF",3,25 July 2019,"I watched this with a friend. I must of complained about the absurdity of the plot a lot, because he said, ""It's a movie. You have to let it go.""If you saw Die Hard, imagine the movie set in the White House and you have Olympus has Fallen (only not as entertaining).I could have gotten past the nonsensical plot, except they mentioned (more than once), ""America doesn't negotiate with Terrorists!"" Then, they proceed to.....well, you know.I didn't really care about any of the characters, so it didn't matter who lived or died. Ultimately, I died a little inside after watching this movie.",Olympus Has Fallen
215,slicedbread117,Don't judge a book by its cover.,8,29 August 2013,"My summary would describe what I learned after walking out of the theater following Olympus Has Fallen. I had some free time after my shift at the theater ended, so I said what the heck. I had low expectations for the movie, expecting another cheesy action movie that had potential and bombed it. But I was wrong indeed.This movie is non-stop action, like expected, only it was...well good. Really good. It was brutal, bloody, heart-pounding action all the way through and the movie never takes its foot off the gas. While a terrorist attack on the White House seems as cheesy as it can get, the movie portrays it in a way that is somewhat believable but more importantly, extremely entertaining. The setting provides for wave after wave of explosive action, and the opening fire fight in the front lawn of the White House is one of the best parts of the film. Eventually Olympus falls, and former Presidential guard Mike Banning has to take back the White House and save the President, 90's action movie style.Now, a 90's action movie style film can't be done without the right guy to rip through baddies left and right. I'm happy to say that after low expectations, Gerard Butler delivers a smart, brutal, and bad ass action hero that will remind some of Rambo or John McClane. Using his inside knowledge of his past occupation, Banning works through the most secure building on the planet (except for today) taking down anything and everything that stands in his way. And my God is it a blast to watch. The gritty, hard-nosed style that Butler brought to the table was pure old school action fun, and earns him the gold star of the show. After all, what's a good action movie without a good action hero? Gerard Butler as Mike Banning is that hero.Butler might be a blast to watch, but the supporting cast surrounding him helps the movie avoid the cheesy action flick I was expecting. Morgan Freeman (Morgan freaking Freeman) plays Speaker of the House Trumbull, who has to take over as Commander in Chief after President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) is taken hostage by a powerful military force. Both Freeman and Eckhart (who I both adore from their roles in The Dark Knight) give the movie that extra smack of acting talent that an action film such as this needs to remain exciting and alive. Not to mention other solid roles from Dylan McDermott and antagonist Rick Yune.Sure this movie's plot is hardcore cliché, and it is very predictable, but who cares. The story keeps you entertained and again, the setting is great for numerous action sequences to take place. This is old school action! Even with the serious tone of the movie, you can almost completely side step it and just enjoy the movie for what it is: a blood-spilling, action-packed roller coaster, extravaganza. Like the old saying goes, don't judge a book by its cover, and I learned my lesson after exiting the movie with faith yet in the old school action movie genre.8/10",Olympus Has Fallen

217,FabledGentleman,Who writes this crap?,2,30 June 2013,"Well, right after i was finished watching this rather less impressive piece of cinema, i asked my self. Who the hell writes crap like this? So i looked at the two writers involved, and found out they have not done anything else, than to write this script. Ever!.. So to speak..You see, the reason i wanted to know is just so i can avoid other movies these people have been involved in, which happily for me was none. But Antoine Fuqua has some experience though.. or has he? Well, Training Day was good... But after that he has not done one single good movie. And this is probably his worst so far.Those people these days that say : It's a good popcorn movie, well to you i say, stop with the excuses alright. So as long as explosions go off, peoples arms break off, bullets gets fired, it's a good popcorn flick? And if the popcorn digests correctly it was an entertaining movie, and if it was entertaining, it was also good?. Am i right?Not many people are stupid enough to swallow the plot in this movie, but we live in tense times,and USA has enemies all around the world, capable of doing anything,even take over the white house. We all know this is possible right?. After all we saw something similar on 9/11.Americans gets killed in cold blood in this film, we see it all. Koreans shoot babies, Koreans shoots dog, Koreans shoot people from medic trucks, Koreans are always the first to draw a knife in hand to hand combat, Koreans are merciless and cruel, Koreans torture and beat women, Koreans shoot holes in the American flag(oh my!),Koreans want to annihilate the almighty Unites States Of America! You got to wonder why a movie like this is made in the first place, it's like the perfect scary movie for most Americans. The evil North Koreans with their nukes, their hate, their big army.. They can just walk into any ones house in USA at any time of day, any time of the year and kill you. That is what this movie tells you. And it does it without even have a hint of humor. Everything is dead serious.I just can not understand what Morgan Freeman is thinking of, putting himself in this film. The paycheck was probably more than decent.Stay away from this film, it is propaganda crap that almost makes the movie Battleship look good. And back to the popcorn part, there are action movies made that are really really good, that you can chew popcorn to, and still have a good movie. Like The bourne ultimatum, Aliens, Die Hard, The Avengers... Pff, if you are going to see this film anyways, Please eat your popcorn, this way you get something out of it.

SFX on a few white house battle scenes looks like movies made in the sixties. In addition to the 3rd code stupidity, there are some other dummy holes, which have moved a number of users to give this movie a one or two.

219,dutchs-1,Fun Popcorn Movie,7,9 April 2013,"The plot: North Korean commandos take the White House, led by Kang (Kodos was apparently busy doing his laundry that day). The plan is to blackmail the U.S. into pulling out of South Korea, leaving it at the mercy of North Korea. His further plan is to self-destruct all of our ICBM's in their silos using a top-secret self-destruct mechanism called Cerberus. Supposedly this will detonate the nuclear warheads, too. A former White House Secret Service agent is the only survivor of the attack, and he proceeds to disrupt the plan. Although Gerard Butler (Agent) and Aaron Eckhart (President) have top billing, the movie pretty much belongs to Morgan Freeman (Acting President) and Angela Bassett (Head of the Secret Service). Considered as an action movie, it's hard to see any way to add to it. But giving it the same rating as Lord of the Rings or Gone With The Wind? Get out. So how to do it? Let's give it 100 points to start.+10 extra credit for avoiding the dumbest cliché in action movies, where someone's holding a hostage and there are ten people with guns nearby and the hostage is yelling ""take the shot,"" but they don't. (Lookin' at you, Dark Knight)+10 extra credit for avoiding the second dumbest cliché, where the hero fails to watch his back and gets taken by surprise. +10 extra credit for not having a heart-wrenching hostage situation involving the President's son, and generally having the smarts to keep the kid out of the movie as much as possible.Now the dings:+10 for having a really nasty villain, -10 for making his demise too easy. A wash. -5 for never mentioning we have a nuclear triad, and if our ICBM's are neutralized, we still have bombers and submarines. -5 for saying we have 28,500 troops in the DMZ, whereas that's the total for all of Korea. -5 for not realizing that South Korea has one seriously tough military, on its own. If we only have 28,500 troops there, South Korea must feel pretty confident. -5 for not responding to Kang's tirade about the poverty of North Korea by pointing out it's 100% their own fault, and if he had a pair he'd do something about it. It won't affect a fanatic like Kang but it might have a salutary effect on any viewers who are inclined to bestow victimhood on North Korea. -5 for not suspecting that nukes are pretty robust and certainly someone has what-iffed an accidental or deliberate detonation of a rocket in a silo. -5 for not counter-threatening that if our ICBM's are detonated, the bomber-based and sub-based nukes will turn North Korea into a sea of glass. -10 for having a self-destruct system that can be set off before the missiles are even launched. -10 for a bunch of trained guys standing in the open with pistols trying to take out attackers with automatic weapons. -10 for letting the countdown clock go all the way to zero.So that's 100 plus 30 minus 60 = 70.

Okay, so at what point wouldn't NORAD launch every available F16, Apache, or fire every single SAM in the capital at it. How many police stations are in Washington, how many swat teams, national guard, and the many agencies.

The plot and the special effect keep you excited and entertained. The plot makes the viewers curious to see how White House can be captured under terrorists within less than an hour. And most scenes are filled with action, with only a few breaks. However, it's just good for a one-time watch and didn't really give anything more than that. Just another Hollywood entertainment. If you're bored, then this can be a good choice. If you look for deeper meaning, this is almost zero.A few things annoyed me, though. Why did the President and the Minister had to look so fiercely and hateful and keep throwing spiteful words at the enemy all the time? They are people that suppose to know how to calm oneself under stressful circumstance, but from what this movie present you, they look really cheap and have no inner power. Another thing is...the whole country is saved by only one hero, instead of everyone working together. In this movie, the military, the Seal, the President, and everybody else are powerless and did all things wrong all the time, only our hero was the one who did all the right things and save the day.

After a fatal accident eighteen months ago leaves the Asher family in tatters, the disgraced Banning is pushed back to a side-line government role. Meanwhile at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, a clan of highly skilled North Korean terrorists infiltrate the world's most fortified house without hiccup, and take the president hostage. Not only do they want American forces to withdraw their support for South Korea, they intend to use the States' own nukes to turn the nation into a destitute wasteland. With the acting president, House Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman), and the rest of Team America in dire straits, it's left to the broad-shouldered Banning to use his Intel and military expertise to save the President – nay, the world – as we know it.With the spin surrounding a potential North Korea nuclear attack, seeing this star-spangled, preposterously right wing American film is a little discomforting. Not because it is an intelligent and harrowingly coincidental portrayal of the current situation, but because one can imagine gun-toting Americans taking some sort of solace in this inherently prejudicial picture.Directed by Training Day's Antoine Fuqua, it's a clunky, 'one man vs. the world' procedural which plays out like a deviant adaptation of Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, mixed together with Die Hard. Unlike Bruce Willis, Butler is so devoid of humour or charm that his boisterous action-hero shtick – not to mention a sketchy American accent – are excruciating.Relying on bloodied fight sequences and shoddy CGI explosions, the supporting cast (including Oscar winning Melissa Leo) are given nothing in the way of a good script or space to show off their acting credentials.

229,LordJiggy,Enjoyable Action with Character,8,23 March 2013,"First, you know this film was pitched as ""Die Hard in the White House."" Yet, given that limitation, the film manages to avoid a number of pitfalls that have crept into the many lesser imitations of the first (and still best of them) ""Die Hard."" It's the characters in the film that keep it from being too much of a cartoon. The lead character, played by Butler, has had a fall a grace. In a more clichéd film, he'd be a broken, embittered alcoholic (e.g., Kevin Bacon in ""The Following"") who happens upon a chance for redemption and salvation. Instead, Butler's Secret Service agent is getting on with his life in a desk job, disappointed, anxious to be of more use, but not a shambling wreck of a human. He is a career professional, and when the events of the story take place, he reacts like a professional. The wisecracks are few (he doesn't ""kill n' quip"") and understated, which makes them more effective. Other characters have small touches (especially Melissa Leo) that make them distinctive and worth rooting for. A very welcome touch is the way the film-makers foil our expectations...they've seen many of the same movies, and rather than follow the cookie-cutter approach of bad scripts, they twist those situations to make them new and interesting.The action is well done and exciting. It's not a perfect film, but more than competent, continually engaging, and, in the highest praise I can offer, worth full price.",Olympus Has Fallen
230,DjfunkmasterG,Good Actioner with balls,8,18 September 2013,"So out of the 2 Terrorists take over the white house films I have to pass the trophy to Olympus Has Fallen. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (Shooter) we get a decent action ride about a group of Korean Terrorists who more or less bring total destruction to our nations capitol, and in the process take control of the most famous house around the world in order to bring war and destruction to not only the US bu the world.Between the two films OHF does it right, it brings the destruction and brutality to a level not seen in a long time. WHD waters it to the point it is just a drowning shell of a film.Gerard Butler stars as Mike Banning, a special forces ranger who has been working for the secret service, protecting POTUS, until a fateful winter night on the way to a fund raiser an accident claims the life of the first lady, forcing the president to replace Banning so the memories don't haunt him.When S. Korean delegates come to discuss issues with POTUS about N. Korea, they group is immediately taken hostage by members of the team posing as allies. The amount of diversion and destruction they create to create subterfuge is just eye opening and jaw dropping insane. Banning, now on a desk job, as the destruction begins to bring DC to its knees, makes a b-line for the WH in order to assess the situation and try and save the presidents life.OHF could almost be, and kind of is, Die Hard in the White House. IN fact had they used this story as a Die hard 5 I think DH fans wouldn't have been nearly as alienated as they were with the horrible 5th entry of the DH series, but OHF safely picks up the slack left behind, and Butler really has you cheering for him every step of the way.The main cast, is a great ensemble for an event film of this nature:Aaron Eckhart - President Butler - Mike Banning Ld SS agent Morgan Freeman - Speaker of the HouseThe supporting cast includes, Robert Forester (Jackie Brown), Dylan McDermott and a few other familiar faces that have you enjoying each side they're on in this conflict.Now the film isn't without its flaws... a big brother little brother relationship between the presidents son, and Mike is hinted upon briefly but not explored nearly like it should be, it starts to bring you to the point that as it is shown you expect it to be a key part of the plot but instead it fizzles off like the last bottle rock in your fireworks kit that happens to be a dud, some other loop holes with Weapons system supposedly in place within the US weren't well thought out either, but when looking at the package as a whole, you just shrug and feel, yeah it could have been done a bit better but, the overall film was worth the admission price.If you have to watch both, and most likely you will (WHD and OHF) if you watch OHF 1st you'll feel like you wasted time on watching WHD 2nd, which is 1000% accurate. If you watch WHD, 1st the bad taste left in your mouth will instantly be washed away and you will feel refreshed like using a bottle of Listerine mouth wash.All in all, a solid 2 hour long action that paces well and has you cheer at the right moments.Worth admission and Blu-Ray costs.8 out of 10.",Olympus Has Fallen
231,rcastl2335,By the numbers--usually blood red,5,24 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen is a paint-by-numbers action film by Antoine Fuqua, a director who generally performs better behind the camera. Die Hard at the White House as its been referred to, is in the main, a humorless and very bloody action film with Gerard Butler as a Secret Service agent on a mission-to-redeem-himself, which entails lots of knifings and bullets to the brain of his faceless opponents. It's all very professional--and totally generic. Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Bassett and Melissa Leo are on hand to recite their lines and write their names on the back of a paycheck. This is a movie for people who have seen everything else at the cineplex but still feel the need to spend 2 hours in a darkened auditorium.",Olympus Has Fallen
232,yourfavoritecritic,Olympus Has Failed,4,4 January 2021,"Olympus Has Fallen, is written by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt and is directed by Antione Fuqua. The film follows Mike Banning, a Secret Service agent, played by Gerard Butler, trapped in The White House after a terrorist attack that was carried out by North Korea. Banning must fight for his life in order to save the President of the United of the States and the country as a whole. Released in 2013, Olympus Has Fallen, was met with decent reception and was a moderate success.Going into Olympus Has Fallen I was expecting a subpar action film and that was exactly what I got. The movie's does a fine enough job with its sets up; I actually found the initial attack on The White House to be pretty thrilling, it's a 30 minutes sequence packed with entertaining action. The rest of the runtime is spent with Mike Banning taking on seemingly endless waves of terrorists and that is mostly alright. It does get pretty mind-numbing and the character of Banning isn't someone I found myself all too attached to, he's a pretty stock hero-type. Gerard Butler does a fine job I suppose, he wasn't noticeably bad or anything, however he wasn't great either; the same could be said for the remainder of the cast. Although Morgan Freeman's performance definitely felt phoned in, I didn't get the emotions I should have from his character, he didn't seem all too worried about the situation that was happening in front of him.Clocking in at just under 2 hours, Olympus Has Fallen, is a painfully average action film, if you enjoy mindless violence and America vs. the World, types of films then this movie is for you. It is definitely a film that is requires the viewer to turn off their brain and just enjoy what's in front of them, however with that nothing really stuck with me. Olympus Has Fallen, is quite forgettable, nothing about the action really stood out, apart from opening terrorist attack. The acting is wooden, CGI is laughable and the story isn't all too hot either. This sort of film offers nothing new outside of possibly pleasing action movie fans, if that's your thing then you may get more enjoyment out of this film than I did. I am giving Olympus Has Fallen a 4/10.",Olympus Has Fallen
233,gfrancis0,"I know they had to make this look possible, but...",5,21 September 2013,"First the official run time is 119 minutes, why is this not listed IMDb? The best parts of this movie were the action and the boom boom special effects. The worst part was the plot, both how completely implausible it is and how predictable it is at almost every turn. It is super similar to the first Die Hard in many ways as well. They had some decent fight scenes, but the dumb side of that was that EVERYONE has a gun in the movie, why is there so much punching and kicking going on? Bad guys in this movie also seem to be able to materialize knives out of thin air in the middle of a fight. I am sure that anyone who is involved with national security, especially presidential and White House security HATES this movie. They are made to look like complete buffoons over and over. Starts with the first scene with the presidential motorcade just barreling down icy winter roads in the middle of a blizzard, pretty smart security right there. My favorite is that apparently the defense of the White House itself is mostly guys in suits running out into in the middle of the lawn firing handguns. The number of guys firing hand-held weapons at an airplane is pretty laughable as well. Even the most interesting twist, getting the Cerberus codes, ends up looking stupid as they try to crack the third code one character at a time. Yep, the top secret nuclear system responds to each letter of the code with a ""yep that's it"" or ""nope, try again"" until you get each one right, makes sense to me. Is any of my sarcasm coming through? Kind of tough in print. Anyway, if you are looking for an action thriller, but do not want to think too much about feasibility or plausibility, then this is not a horrible way to spend a couple of hours.

238,trevor-mcinsley,Outrageously Stupid Film,1,4 February 2014,I think this might be the worst film ever made. I went into it without seeing any trailers for it or even reading the plot summation on Netflix. Such things invariably ruin a film. For instance if I had read the brief plot summation on Netflix then I might as well have skipped the first half hour of the film as it gave this away in its entirety. In any case... it didn't matter. The plot was wildly predictable to the point where it was just obvious.In fact the only surprise was that police and Secret Service agents were stupid enough to fire handguns and sniper rifles at a speeding gunship with zero chance of doing any damage to it whatsoever. Quite what they were hoping to achieve was unclear. The whole plot is predicated on the bus load of Korean tourists (predictable) being heavily armed terrorists and the South Korean minister's security team (laughably obvious) being in on it and taking over the White House. Well maybe if the morons defending it hadn't sat around wildly firing into the sky like drunken cowboys they might have been able to offer a more adequate defence.Oddly enough none of the Americans seemed remotely surprised when they came under attack and acted like it happened every day. Even if you drill for something and are prepared it still takes you by surprise when it actually happens. Not a single actor appeared to convey this emotion. Then the Koreans were taken into the bunker 'against protocol' and yet no one even questioned whether they were up to something dodgy until they started shooting people. How can it be that you scarcely blink when a Gatlin Gun toting twin-engine aircraft shows up or at the notion of a surprise ground attack... and yet not be suspicious enough to consider the incredibly dodgy looking Koreans you are locked in a metal box with? This plot is actually insulting. It is designed for a stupid audience and relies on explosions and special effects to distract from the complete lack of a worthwhile plot. Oddly enough then the special effects were actually pretty bad. Definitely not the high budget stuff we have become used to.This said... I actually enjoyed watching the first half of this film. I did not watch it as an action film or a thriller though. I viewed it as a comedy and once I did this it was so much better. Suddenly the whole thing made sense after this revelation that no serious film could be this dreadful unless it was on purpose.For instance I have no doubt that there are contingency plans in place to protect the White house from all manner of theoretical attacks. When I was in Washington just a year before this film was released we couldn't get anywhere near the building and the police and security presence within blocks of it was enormous.However I sincerely doubt the scale of this protection is limited to an enormous army of ill-trained morons who serve as nothing more than cannon fodder. Honestly the 'defenders' of the White House simply run into machine gun fire and stand around in the open waiting to die. Meanwhile the Korean attackers just Waltz up the lawn in a tight cluster which realistically could be eliminated by a single grenade. You would think that such a heavily armed building might have just the odd dumb-fire rocket launcher to bypass the aircraft's counter measures? Or to take out the improvised armoured gun platforms? No. Apparently they only have BB guns.Seriously... how is it that the North Korean forces are capable of getting in range of the White House with a larger and more powerful arsenal of weapons and equipment than the entire defending force of 'the most secure building in the country'? The overarching plot line of the film is then the terrorists plan to get the three codes needed for some nuclear disarmament something or other. This plot device is meant to be some bulletproof system and yet the three people with the codes are all in the same building? Real bulletproof. When the people with these codes get tortured to give them up the president orders them to do so. Almost immediately. This makes him the biggest idiot of the lot as it should be completely obvious that when it comes time to get the president's code the terrorists will know that rather than torture him all they need to do is hurt the others.Oddly they seem to be in no rush whatsoever to get these codes and seem far more interested to delay the acquisition of them so as to act as a ticking clock to offset the increasingly stupid action sequences. I forced myself to watch the last half hour of this senseless drivel just to work out what happened with the whole Cerberus code business as it seemed like the writers just forgot about it.I am so glad I hung on. The ending is just hilarious. I mean dreadful and retarded but hilarious nonetheless. It turns out that this bulletproof system of disarming the nukes doesn't disarm them so much as it does... detonate them. What kind of moronic military would design nukes that can be detonated on their own soil without even being launched? What possible benefit could that ever have that would outweigh that risk? It is so stupid and bad it is actually amusing.A ridiculous film which does not get any better as it progresses and then ultimately devolves into total absurdity that discredits every other moment of the entire plot. Simply startling that this ever got off paper.,Olympus Has Fallen
239,loevw,Enjoyable action thriller if you don't expect realism,7,26 November 2016,"I've just watched this movie (in 2016) and it reminded me of White House Down, so I was hoping it would somehow be considerably different. They're not. I mean, the details have changed but the essence of the plot remains the same. If they hadn't been released in the same year, I'd have thought it was a remake. Anyway, if you enjoyed WHD, chances are you'll like this one too. If not, better pick something else to watch.You should know straight away from the implausible plot that this isn't the kind of movie where you'd watch something realistic. There are many plot holes, and if you're the kind of person that sits there thinking ""wait, why didn't he do this, how come that happened, that doesn't make sense..."" and that takes away your enjoyment of the film, then stay away from this one.If you know that it's only meant as a piece of entertainment with the typical bad guy vs good guy, then this is fun and far from boring. It's not excellent either. It's mostly guns and the fight scenes weren't as well crafted as what you might see in say, the Bourne Identity or Transporter. But it all flows very nicely right from the start and it's two hours of solid action entertainment with enough suspense to keep you wondering what will happen next.In short, if you enjoy an action thriller and don't think too much during the movie, this is a good one to watch.",Olympus Has Fallen

241,dbogosian-1,Atrocious,3,24 September 2013,"From its initial sequence to its end, this movie has very little going for it, unless you enjoy gratuitous on-screen carnage. There is so much that is unrealistic, one cannot begin to enumerate the ways. (One very minor example: a shot and wounded president walks out of the White House and is greeted by an escort of soldiers who, rather than putting him on a stretcher and carrying him away, drape his arms on their shoulders and help him walk.) The characters all seem flat and lifeless, and even the better actors (like Morgan Freeman) are just going through the motions. The story line is completely predictable. The film relies on innumerable clichés (e.g., a ticking clock counting the seconds down to nuclear catastrophe, while the hero attempts to avert disaster with only seconds to go).There is a little interest in the lead character who was unfairly disgraced in a past incident, but now has a shot at redemption. Some of the action sequences are mildly interesting from a technical point of view. But overall this movie is a complete waste of your time and brainpower. My only excuse for sitting through it all is that I was on a trans-Atlantic flight, and it helped kill the time.",Olympus Has Fallen

Brutal, but that's the nature of the genre. Also some badly done swearing. Cheesy.A big pile of turds with rough gemstones in it, but more than I was expecting.

244,sedativchunk,Ridiculous and over the top but VERY enjoyable!,8,1 September 2013,"It's Labor Day weekend and looking on Amazon Prime for a decent movie to watch over the weekend I ran across ""Olympus has Fallen"". I heard about it coming out but didn't know what it was about in detail or if it was good or not. But with a promising cast including Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman, I had to give it a shot. Olympus Has Fallen is a movie about a terrorist attack on the white house. A former secret service agent who works in D.C. happens to be around when the white house goes under attack. He springs into action, killing terrorist, saving lives, and tearing it up throughout the white house. The rest of the plot, I'll leave to the viewer to learn the final story and events without spoiling it.I rented it and watched it in one sitting. Bottom line - REALLY enjoyed this movie. Is it over the top? Yes. Is it completely ridiculous and unrealistic? Yes. Does any of that matter? Not really. This is a true, rock-em, sock-em, action flick with Gerard Butler's high energy driving it. I have to say the action really outweighed any downfalls/flops in the storyline. I really enjoyed it and usually I pick at movies like this. Honestly the only real thing besides the unrealistic side of the movie is the CGI. Some areas of the CGI were very budget-y and looked like clips out of a video game and not genuine elements. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend it. A good date night movie or something to watch on your own one night. It's fun and entertaining and had me glued to the television from beginning to end. It's above average but I can't give it any more credit than that for a weak story and ridiculous action scenes. I did thoroughly enjoy it though and recommend to audiences.",Olympus Has Fallen
245,ActionFan-Reviews,This Movie Kicks Serious ASS!!,7,19 April 2013,"Now over the past little while Gerard Butler has given us some movies like ""playing for keeps"" and ""chasing mavericks"". I respect him for trying something different but let me say that in this film he's back doing what he does best - cracking skulls, literally!. Now this film will be for those guys like me who are tired of movies being toned down for a PG 13 rating. It's a brutal and bloody throwback to the glory days of action cinema in the 80's/90's. this film combines elements of other great action flicks like die hard,under siege, red dawn, independence day, the raid: redemption and many more you could think of. Comparisons aside,It stands well on it's own to many of the classics iv'e mentioned. This flick would of been perfect for guys like Stallone, Schwarzenegger or Willis twenty years ago.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film to people who need to go through every little thing to see whether that would happen in real life. Because this film is escapism at its best and too much thinking isn't required. Now if your a person who wants a fun action packed film where you just sit back, munch on popcorn and enjoy the fun, I would highly recommend it.7.5/10",Olympus Has Fallen
246,koen_smit,Not only Olympus has fallen,4,25 April 2014,"So I watched this movie today to see if this 'other' White House Ambush-movie is as entertaining as White House Down. Unfortunately it is far from. Sure – there's enough action, exploding stuff and hide and seek inside the White House, but so many impossibilities inside the script that I was getting more annoyed than entertained. For instance: when a plane hits the Lincoln memorial would you still be standing next to it to watch it come down and the bricks hit you? Or worse: the Gerard Butler character was working for the president but got laid off 18 months ago and still all his codes and passwords still work?? Seriously: he deletes classified files and opens safes with guns inside I would say that's quite a security failure inside the supposedly most secured building in the world. The son of the president is the only leverage the terrorists might have and they save it at the first attempt. Well, that's not really exciting now, is it And there are much more of those failures in this movie. The most unbelievable storyline is making sure the president is alive at the possible cost of worldwide death and devastation. No, I do not buy that. Then there is of course the 'we are the best nation in the world'-ending which doesn't bother me if it's done in a good way in a good movie. In this movie it's disgusting and totally misplaced, I wanted a bucket to throw up in. Grow up, people - this was total bull.Once again big budget and well known actors still doesn't mean it's gonna be a good movie. This was lame, badly written and annoying.

247,CinemaCocoa,Olympus has FALLEN SHORT,4,12 July 2014,"Well I had always intended to watch this... but now that I have I have discovered some awful not-supposed-to-be-funny 'Murica trite.When a terrorist attack on the American White House ends with the President and his aids taken hostage and the House turned into a fortress, only an ex-Secret Service agent (who was retired due to an earlier accident that caused the death of the President's wife) can save the day.The 1990s were full of action political thrillers and Olympus has Fallen appears to be trying to rekindle that genre of film: grounded, realistic and most importantly contemporary stories based around sieges, hostages or conspiracies. But either Olympus has missed the point completely, or something has been lost over the last fifteen years. First of all, this film (as someone from the UK) is so overwhelmingly America, just... in your face America. Okay, that's fine for a while. But when every single scene for the first twenty minutes is noble politicians striding boldly through corridors while the score blares with trumpets and warbles with drums, over and over again, I'm sorry but you lose any sense of nobility. We then have the actual attack on the White House which is spectacular, there's no denying that the action in the film is well done (there's no obnoxious shaky-cam for a start, I generally knew where everything was!) but again the total lack of defence around Washington DC was outright laughable. ""Suspension of disbelief"" is all well and good, but when a tone of a film is generally seen as realistic or gritty, behaving like an action thriller than a standard popcorn flick, these sorts of issues become targets for criticism. Sure, trumpet how awesome America is just before obliterating everything it stands for a moment later! ... The film is a bloody sequence too: televised executions, beatings, stabbings, traitors, all shown through a lens of gritty hardship. I can't actually call this pro-America, it comes across more like self-defecation!Then there is Gerald Butler... Oh boy. I don't dislike the man; I enjoyed Law Abiding Citizen (for example) but this film's script and acting is atrocious. I've already said this film is bringing the 1990s back, and that is right. I've seen all of these cliché sequences before. I had all of the emotional attachment for him and his wife/girlfriend/partner/person as I do for my toothbrush: every now and then, I am reminded that it's there. Butler's character is, for want of a better analogy, The Terminator. We see these terrorists enter the story by massacring hundreds of civilians, and so naturally Butler can go on a bloody rampage executing any terrorist he sees with impunity. Imagine Die Hard, but without the sense of humour or self awareness. He just growls and murders his way to inevitable victory (oh, could that be a spoiler? You mean you weren't sure if the personification of America would survive this ordeal?)Ugh. Suspension of disbelief can carry you so far, but after that you need to tone down the pretentiousness. It is a forgettable action film that doesn't know how to act. ""We are realistic and contemporary: We... have hi-tech Hydra weapon platforms. We Stand for American integrity: We use a three-code nuclear activation system called Cerberus.""I need a good note to finish on... uhm... uhm...

It's almost as if we are witnessing a game of ""Call of Duty"" set in Washington, in legendary difficulty.Resuming, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is an impish action movie, that doesn't ask for permission to ignite the screen with a nearly apocalyptic Washington, D.C landscape.

251,pyx,"A blatant Die Hard rip-off, but with far less credibility",4,13 August 2013,"This movie transplants Die Hard 1 from Nakatoma Plaza to the White House, but other than that, all the major plot elements are near identical - super-genius villain, personal interest (this time played by the President's son rather than Maclane's wife), unbelievable hacking skills, idiotic rescue forces, superhuman man on the inside who knows best, and more besides.The movie insults you at every turn, starting with the ease with which the white house is captured, and the gross stupidity of the special forces, and the secret service agents. But by far the most egregious, and most idiotic plot premise, is the idea that nukes that haven't been launched or even armed yet, can now be ordered to self destruct in their own silos.Then there's the premise that South Korea would be left defenceless simply to save the life of the President. And of course, the other unbelievable premise is that not only are the only three people with the codes to disarm the nukes all EVER in the same place at the same time, but that such a vital function would even depend upon such a fallible failsafe in the first place. So once the nukes have been accidentally launched, if just one of the three civilians entrusted with their self destruct codes is incapacitated or unavailable, that's it - no way of cancelling?!The entire premise that Butler's character has shamed himself, is nonsense. An unavoidable disaster occurs - he takes exactly the right action, when the president is messing around wasting time, and saves the president's life. If the president had complied quicker, his wife could also have been saved.Olympus artlessly manipulates your emotions at every turn, but for all that, it did have some good moments. Butler makes a far more compassionate and likable hero than Bruce Willis. If you can leave every trace of your intelligence at the door, it's not bad for its action content, but its cerebral content is non-existent.",Olympus Has Fallen
252,chimera3,"An Unofficial ""Die Hard"" Ripoff",1,22 October 2017,"I enjoyed watching Gerard Butler in movies like ""The Bounty Hunter,"" ""The Ugly Truth,"" ""Law-Abiding Citizen,"" and even ""Dracula 2000."" When it comes to this, what can you possibly say? He can do action and he can do comedy, but this is neither. All it is is another dreaded attempt to try to get him to measure up to Bruce Willis...and it is a failure. Mr. Butler can certainly stand alone when it comes to action movies, that is for sure.Butler plays Secret Service agent Mike Banning, who is best friends with the President (Aaron Eckhart), the First Lady (Ashley Judd), and their son. To begin, he gets into a car accident after running into a deer, which ultimately claims the life of the First Lady. Fast forward a year and a half later and he still feels guilty about what happened, having taken a desk job after being removed from the Secret Service proper.He sulks about his so-called daily life with his wife/girlfriend Leah (Radha Mitchell). One day, things go sour when Washington D.C. is under attack by a band of North Koreans, killing everyone and destroying everything in sight before taking hold of the White House and doing the exact same thing. Fighting through his shame, Mike is called into action to kill the villains and save the President and anyone else of his staff who still happens to be alive. In a cliché with a capital C, he does just that, reunites with Leah and is redeemed by the President.In the end, I cannot begin to describe the many things that are wrong with this so-called movie. Antoine Fuqua, the very man who brought us the questionable ""Training Day,"" puts Quentin Tarantino and John Woo to shame when it comes to hardcore action, explosions, and gratuitous violence. It certainly shows here, I'll tell you that. Granted I have no problems with any of those things, I was deeply disturbed by what I saw here. It seemed like there had to be blood and explosions everywhere you turned in this dreadful movie.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. If you're going to watch a Gerard Butler movie, watch something like ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Law-Abiding Citizen."" Those movies are more his speed than this. Trust me.

254,paq5528,"Big Stars, Black (plot) Holes, a White House",4,7 April 2013,"First off, let me say that the movie is a high production Hollywood film meaning the guns look real, there is ample budget for Apache helicopters and realistic sets, professionally choreographed fight scenes, and the requisite amount of explosions and CGI effects.However, looking at this film in terms of realistic plot and character development, it lacks quite a bit. Without giving anything away, if you saw the trailer, this shouldn't be a spoiler, we're expected to believe an outrageous number of defensive failures on the part of several security organizations -- enough to bring on a not-so-clever or intriguing attack on the White House. Let's just go with that for a moment, using our advanced sense of Hollywood suspended disbelief syndrome and hope that, although the plot is implausible, at least the characters make it real.Morgan Freeman gives one of his most cardboard, stale acting appearances ever. The stereotypical military head says to blow things up, the more reticent advisers say to act cautiously, the President decries the inhumanity of killing staff members while the body count from the aforementioned guns and ammo displays and explosions count easily into the many dozens (hundreds likely, difficult to count). Our one last hope is Gerard Butler. I must say I like him as an action hero, and he played his role well here. But he was vaguely a man of action at the beginning of the movie, albeit at a desk for a few brief moments about 10 minutes in to 14 minutes into the movie, and he was a more defined man of action by the end of the movie -- don't look for any more character development from any character in the movie at any time. That was it; no development whatsoever. It's like asking for architectural and civil planning lessons from the suburbs of Detroit. The phrase ""devoid of"" comes to mind.Watch this only if you want some mindless action without having to think at all. And once again you can wave a patriotic American flag at the end and put another point forward for American exceptionalism.",Olympus Has Fallen

And that's the first clue that you're watching a mediocre movie.Most key elements of this movie are very predictable. Either we've seen it before, or it was simply directed and edited in a way that foreshadows the next scene, and ruins the excitement factor.Characters repeatedly do things the typical viewer would do differently (and would do better/smarter/faster). That makes it impossible to truly care for the characters.The lead actors are pretty good in their roles, but there's little heart. I felt more of a connection to random background characters than I did to the stars. The audience should very easily relate to the hero. But he felt nearly paper thin. He had the strength of character, good morals, higher than average intelligence and balls to do the job, but I just didn't care too much about him.It's decent action flick with lots of guns and explosions.

259,merdiolu,A Very Strong Razzie Nominee,1,2 April 2013,"What can I say ? First of all congratulations Antonio Fuqua. Selling and getting BO profit from a production straight lifted or ripped down to last inane dialog from a B grade cheese flick you can rent from Blockbuster or Netflix is an accomplishment no one can deny. It is even more impressive to get positive reviews for this silly trash that takes itself seriously which makes it even more terrible. When this thing was called Air Force One everyone every critic ripped it apart. Only explanations Olympus Has Fallen getting a 7+ point in IMDb ( a rating system which I will never take care of ) after so many years can be decreasing IQ of mass movie going audience and insecurities of 9/11 on US public. Every dumb stupid over the top Die Hard action cliché was crammed in this production. A C-130 gunship entering restricted DC airspace before shot down from a safe distance beggars belief. Or highly trained Secret Service agents wasting ammunition on a fast flying armoured aircraft. Or same agents exposing themselves only to be mown down. North Korean terrorists ( yeah you read that right Korean ) are depicted more like Orcs or Klingons. Any actual Koreans watching this film would probably laugh his ass off. At least in Hollyland Number 1 villains are not Middle Easterns with cheesy Arab accents anymore. What else ? Fallen military trained lone wolf hero killing all of them one by one , meanwhile taunting evil mastermind ( who makes one of most ridiculous evil turnout / reveal scene just by taking glasses off. Rick Yune is just not Gary Oldman ) with US macho jargon and saves the day. Down to talking to his wife in the middle of war zone he basically screams ""I am a John McLane looka like no:10241."" Failed military strike to retake captured building to increase tension. Oh look only 3 seconds left to disaster...AAAAAND it is averted.Last year Hollywood Powers That Be gave us Lockout which had basically same script but also semi enjoyable but this is just awful. I completely erased Gerard Butler from list of professional actors in fact I will stay away from his films away from now on. Aaron Eckhart , Morgan Freeman and Dylan McDermott will have to struggle a lot to redeem themselves in my eyes after this.Have I mentioned shoddy CGI or annoying heroic /sad music during supposedly heroic/sad moments ?",Olympus Has Fallen
260,mecheart,"A watered down, absurdly over-the-top remake of Die Hard the original",4,1 May 2013,"I remember going along excitedly to the movie theater with my father to see 'Die Hard' in 1988 at the age of fourteen. What an experience that was, as it ending up a night of explosive personal firsts. My first exposure to uncensored Bruce Willis, and an excellent introduction to a lifelong pursuit of the next great action film. Because of 'Die Hard' I was later able to closely relate to my father's favorite genre - the western - and the action stars of his own teen years: Eastwood, Wayne, Mitchum and Douglas. What a memorable experience.From the opening credits of 'Olympus Has Fallen' I had the sense that the writer's/director's intent was to re-script and recast 'Die Hard' for a modern audience. Of course, I was very skeptical. Twenty minutes in I knew exactly what plot twists the film was going to follow, and how it would end - never a good thing.To sum the film up... well, the actors were lifeless in their temporary skins, or so over-the-top fake as to be annoying, save for Aaron Eckert who did just OK as the POTUS. Gerard Butler? Well, the action stars of the 80's - the really good ones - all had a manner, or a trait or some kind of trademark behavior that lent viewing them excitement in some form or a familiarity. Butler is just...somewhat there and somewhat looks the role of the generic cop/soldier/ex this or that tough guy. Even Van Damme did Van Damme with style! 'Olympus' ignited none of the excitement action movies normally raise for me, and the movie 'escape' was not very immersive at all. I really cared about no one in the film save for the President's son, who played all too well the part of a boy who had other things than acting in a movie on his mind.

The story was interesting (considering the recent events in Korea). The cast was good and the action was pretty intense.This is pretty much the combination of Tom Clancy meets Die Hard in an OK way. There were moments where I laughed and when I awed. Yet there were 2 things that slipped my mind and made me question the movie. Number 1 SPOILER/PLOTHOLE: How is it possible for a ex Secret Serviceman to somehow know a combination to a safe hidden behind a portrait in the Oval Office? Number 2 PLOTHOLE: The Koreas have captured the President and the cabinet, they killed off the VP and SoD is let go which leaves the Treasurer and Attorney General. When they fake the deaths of the President and his cabinet in the getaway chopper, they cut back to the safe bunker and those 2 are nowhere to be seen, What the hell happened to them? Despite those 2 complaints, Olympus has Fallen is a rock solid action flick and I'd definitely recommend anyone to see this if they are into what I consider rock solid flicks.

You'll be watching something far more exciting and original than Olympus. The open sequences do offer some hope with some slick battle scenes but then it settles for drudgery. It's not helped by the fact that Gerard Butler acts like a drunken scots guy trying to do a Robert de Niro accent.

The same goes for the actors. Aaron Eckhart was saying he'd like to be more famous, to have more control over his film choices. I can see why. Anything to get out of doing something this bad. Not even Morgan Freeman can bring the film any much-needed gravitas, even though he's the best actor here.People talk about the depth of characterisation. Pardon? There wasn't a single believable character in the entire film. They were all cardboard cut-outs and stereotypes.In all, this was little more than a two-hour computer game. No... it wasn't even that. At least with a computer game, you get a sense of narrative. You also have some control over the outcome. This just hobbled along from one CGI, blood-and-guts set piece to the next with tedious predictability. It was like watching an episode of 'Thunderbirds', though without the tension and intelligence.If it's meant as a propaganda piece on the prevailing nature of American might and spirit, it fails abysmally.

A terrorist plane was just shooting at innocent citizens like it was casual in Part II -- this was nightmarish!

Gerard Butler does a good job bringing a little more gravitas to the character, although the movie could have benefited from lighter moments. I liked Butler in Law Abiding Citizen and 300 and I liked him in this. Arron Eckhart does a passable job as the President, and Morgan Freeman does his usual great job playing the speaker of the house. If you're watching this because you're an Ashley Judd fan, don't, she's in about the first 5 minutes of the movie.Now for the things I didn't like about the movie, the script was thin, very thin. Dylan McDermott (and I usually like this guy) was possibly the worst villain of all time. His lines were delivered woodenly, sometimes they were so bad that I wasn't sure if they were meant to be serious or funny. His 15 second rant at the President about selling out to the highest corporate bidder was not only laughably bad, it also didn't have any bearing on the plot of the movie.All in all, I have seen worse movies, the action is very good, Butler has some great fight scenes reminiscent of 300, and there are lots of gun fights and just good old fashion blowing stuff up scenes.

Olympus brings a lot of classic action flicks to mind, picks and pinches from them, and rolls it all into one big, dumb, explosive shootfest with thrills to spare and a body count so high it would make John Woo baulk. Gerard Butler stars as a hard-nosed Secret Service agent who has since been removed from the presidents' personal bodyguard after the death of the first lady in a car accident 18 months earlier. He is haunted by his failure and regrets the tragedy every day. When tensions between North Korea and South Korea start to simmer, a South Korean envoy arrives at the White House to begin discussions with the US as to how to handle the dangerous North. Unknowingly, the White House has just set in motion events that will lead to the capture of the iconic American building, as NK terrorists have infiltrated the SK envoy, and planned an articulate attack that will capture the president and force him to bend to their will. Only Gerard Butler and his bad American accent can save the day! Olympus Has Fallen is a fun injection of 90s nostalgia. It wants to be an action movie. It wants to be included in the ranks of Under Siege, The Rock, and other iconic action movies of the 80s and 90s. It most desperately aspires to be a new Die Hard, and while it is significantly better than the newest instalment in that franchise, Olympus can't quite achieve the level of suspense and quality of thrills that the original Die Hard provides, but is certainly a sound standalone action film achievement. Olympus has glaring plot holes that it skims over and a suspension of disbelief is essential if you are to enjoy it for what it is. Just deactivate your brain, don't think very hard, because if you do you will miss out on the experience. The film, wanting to continue in the vein of its inspired material, tries not to overindulge in CGI, but ultimately succumbs to temptation considering the massive scale of set pieces and the sheer work involved in practical special effects. Olympus still offers enough squibs and human stuntmen to bring back more of those good memories of Steven Seagal and Nic Cage blasting baddies and jumping from rooftops. It has flaws, its no Shakespeare, it has bad accents, it has glaringly obtuse Die Hard references, it has Morgan Freeman, but most of all, Olympus has hard-boiled action that will keep you glued to the screen from start to finish and makes your $15 ticket feel valuable.

I am disappointed in that regard, but it is expected. There was some good acting from the cast Rick Yune and Morgan Freeman were extremely solid. I also enjoyed Angela Bassett's acting throughout the movie.It just extremely missed in certain aspects that could have turned the film from a typical action movie into something a bit more thought provoking and memorable.True Score: 6.4",Olympus Has Fallen

279,naregian,Do yourself a favor and see this film.,8,23 March 2013,"I actually saw this film about 4 hours after I saw ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" and boy, was this better! I never really have been a Gerard Butler fan but I think he put his name in view of some important people with this film. He made his character believable, and did a great job in the role of the typical bad-ass who everyone's relying on. Let's be honest, Morgan Freeman was probably cast just to boost the lineup of the film, because they knew Gerard and Aaron weren't gonna be enough, but they really were! This movie had pretty much non-stop entertainment and pretty cool scenes. The only thing that caught me off guard was the very unsettling scenes of terroristic violence. The film was rated R for strong violence and language throughout. For those of you who want an action flick with minimally graphic violence, I ask you to proceed with caution. While this is nothing TOO unbearable in terms of violence, the MPAA rating is somewhat misleading, because all it says is ""strong violence"", which is terminology that the MPAA identifies with films not even half as violent. ""Strong, brutal, bloody violence"" would be more like it, just for those of you who are a little hesitant because of the violent content of this film. However, if you can see past it and are in the mood for a very well made, well scripted and nicely directed action flick, go ahead, do yourself a favor and see this movie. This isn't some insightful masterpiece, so don't over analyze, or try to see deeper into it, but take it for what it is, and that's just entertainment.",Olympus Has Fallen
280,HandHStudios,Solid Political Thriller That Felt Like a Flashback to Die Hard,7,31 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen is probably one of my favorite political thrillers of all time. The suspense, action, disaster sequences, likable characters, etc. makes for a solid film with little going wrong in it. A few ""why did they do that"" moments, with some tighter plot lines could've done the trick to make this better, but other than that, it hits the mark on all levels. This movie took me back to John McTiernan's 1988 action thriller ""Die Hard"". This movie had all of the Die hard characteristics we all know and love, and in my opinion, was better than the newest installment to the series! Unlike that film, this movie had tight spaces, a lone ranger in a hostage situation, and even went lengths to feature one of the villains pretending to be a good guy, and is offered cigarettes, just like in 1988. Gerard Butler puts on a solid performance, and leaves me wanting more. A bunch of witty one liners are packed into a superb script by Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. My favorite line: ""Here's a game we can play. It's called ""Go F**k Yourself"". You go first."" A couple of funny moments and much drama and action make this an excellent thriller. And, to top it off, this movie has Morgan Freeman. Plus!HandHStudios rating: 7.8/10",Olympus Has Fallen
281,manusanchez90,Action masterpiece! 9!,9,13 May 2013,"I did not expect ""Olympus has fallen"" to be so good. I thought it would be a decent action movie without many twists in the plot, just a simple action movie with a well-known director and a very good cast. However, it is not just that. It is one of the best realistic action movies I have ever seen. What first really attracted me was the story: the fact that the U. S. President is kidnapped inside the White House itself. I had never heard of anything like that, and at the end of 2013, two movies with the same nuclear plot will have been released. The problem with ""Olympus has fallen"" is the marketing people responsible for it. I do not know why it was released so late in my country, why the marketing campaigns were not huge (like the ones from ""Ironman 3"", which is quite worse as a movie)... I heard the budget had been too low for being a Hollywood commercial action flick, but I am sure not even one cent has been wasted. One strong point in the movie is its cast. The protagonist, Gerard Butler, is a very versatile actor. He is good in comedies, action, drama and mystery. I specially liked him in ""300"", ""Law abiding citizen"" and this one. This time, he plays the part of a bodyguard of the President who is fired after he is unable to rescue the First Lady from an accident and then must save the President inside the White House. The character is a real tough guy with a good heart. Aaron Eckhart (who I liked in ""Batman 2 the dark knight""), another notable actor, plays the role of the U. S. President. He is very believable in his role even though it is not a spectacular performance, but more than correct. Morgan Freeman, the White House's speaker, is very good, too, as always. He is a luxurious secondary actor which elevates the quality level of the films he works in. Rick Yune is the villain, like in ""007 die another day"". I really hated his character, which means he did a very fine job as a cruel southernkorean terrorist without any mercy. There are many more known faces among the actors, like Melissa Leo, Phil Austin, Angela Basset... They are all more than correct portraying believable performances. Anyway, the characters which are most developed are the ones of the protagonist and the president. The pace is maybe the best thing in the movie. Antoine Fuqua, known for ""Trainin day"", ""Brooklyn's finest"" and ""Shooter"" (three excellent movies with action), did an outstanding job. It is very well directed, no minute is boring and combines drama, action, tension and intrigue during almost its one-hour-fifty-five-minute-lenght. The action part is the predominant one, but this does not mean the script is empty and flat at all. I think the plot is quite original. As I said, I did not know any story about a direct attack to the White House. Although the very end is previsible, there are several unexpected twists that kept me at the edge of the seat. The first 30 minutes are introductory. Then, it is all about spectacular action scenes, tense dialogues, violence and dramatic moments. The movie contains many realistically violent scenes. The visuals are not the best in the industry, but they are more than sufficiently good and amazing. Let us not forget the movie is realistic. The scenes of the attack on Washington are incredible and the action scenes are very well-designed. There are many good dialogues, as well. In conclusion, tension and capacity of entertaining are the key words here. Every fan of the action genre must enjoy this extraordinary movie. I am looking forwards to watching ""White House down"" in order to compare both of them, but I do not think that will be this good, but I did not think this would be that good... 9.",Olympus Has Fallen

Probably both. There was not a single moment in the entire film that wasn't outright absurd. It would have been funny, I suppose, and I did get some good laughs throughout the film, but frankly it's a bit terrifying to think people actually enjoy this stuff and believe in what it represents. There was also a tremendously racist representation of Koreans, that kind of took my breath away.

284,generationfilm,"Another Brainless Action Movie That is Offensively Stupid, Overly Violent, and Forcibly Patriotic",5,22 March 2013,"To the casual untrained eye it would seem that director Antoine Fuqua's film Olympus Has Fallen is just a generic thriller that adopts the basics of the Die Hard formula, or rather an Air Force One filled with laughable special effects and unashamed borrowing of superior cinematic products. However, the entire film is an incredibly poetic allegory of Fuqua's career itself alluding to the promise of creative potential that succumbed to overtly insipid storytelling dependent on mindless distractions. Coming onto the scene with great promise through his gritty police drama Training Day it seems Fuqua's career has been falling at a steady pace ever since with each film under his tutelage getting far more ridiculous and far more unrealistic. The devolution of realism can be seen through Fuqua's filmography as he moved from shallow war drama (Tears of the Sun) to illogical conspiracy political thriller (Shooter) to the White House hostage takeover in Olympus Has Fallen. Olympus Has Fallen is beyond absurd and despite some tenuously directed sequences coupled with a surprisingly admirable yet failed attempt at being charismatic from Gerard Butler the film plummets in a downward spiral filled with preposterous setups, brainless dialogue, and over the top violence all on par with a Steven Seagal straight to DVD release. There is plenty of manipulative flag-waving here and it becomes so forceful that you begin to think you're watching the American equivalent of Leni Reifenstahl's Triumph of the Will but in action movie form. Despite having some promise to his career it seems that Fuqua has become Olympus and he has fallen incredibly hard with little to no hope of standing up again. Action junkies will be more than pleased with the adrenaline infused Olympus Has Fallen but that isn't enough to separate it from the other forgettable action frenzied flicks that regularly make their way to the theaters. If you're itching for an improbable, monotonous, and violent piece of manipulative propaganda filled to the brim with action distractions then Olympus Has Fallen is your kind of film but all others should just avoid it all together. It's too bad there isn't a tactical team that could save Fuqua from plummeting further away from his potential talent and keep him from wasting opportunities.Read more here: http://wp.me/py8op-wR Other reviews: generationfilm.net",Olympus Has Fallen

The rest is done by unexpected ground forces appearing to be tourist.Olympus, in this story is the code named president's bunker meant to NOT be able to breach. Butler's character gets to the line about the well trained the breach is to accomplish this NOT expected. Yes, definite accent on the REAL 9/11 what was done by other means than this story. If you are wondering ""other means"" ask students at Oxford what they answered Diane Sawyer a news program when asked what they thought of 9/11. They were NOT duped as most Americans what to believe because they too noted the inconsistence of event.What indeed would be IF this bombardment took place. The first hint in story beginning took place winter 18 months before. Most I will share to NOT spoil for those still wanting to see. Regular ticket price well spent too IF not bargain time.If you have noted critiques put IMDb before by writer's Email, know that I DO NOT put excellent to many productions. Most DO NOT rate high quality in the assembly of producing. A movie budget would have been better spent else where. For the money, wise use helping the needy would have been better used thank many movies produced. This movie is NOT in that category.

In one word, none. This individual hero-worship feels very much a cultural thing, it doesn't care much for team spirit, discipline, sacrifice, fighting for a common cause. You always MUST find one single hero. Not good.This thread carries on a bit when it comes to the willingness of the Pentagon to risk the whole country just to save the President. Seriously? Talk about putting the cart before the horse. The president is supposed to serve and sacrifice for his country, not the other way around. Very easily replaced.Out of all the silly stuff that goes on in these movies, the most baffling one was how the President orders his two team members to give their captors the ""code"" they're looking for.

There is a villain out to take the White House (Olympus) and a hero to avert him and save the POTUS. I would say that despite the simplicity of the story-line, the film is gripping, to say the least. There is a sense of urgency, a sense of foreboding cunningly crafted into the narrative which makes you root for the good guy. Gerard Butler is as usual the tough Secret Agent who cannot die or lose. I would have liked the other subplots (for example Butler's girlfriend) to have gotten more attention. This is not a serious film with a layered plot. It is a genre film with obvious plot holes and inconsistensies, but they hardly matter when the drama is so well enacted and tightly scripted.

292,pfogertyca,Die Hard Does D.C.,2,13 August 2013,"They couldn't cast Bruce Willis in the title role, so they settled for that Scottish actor who can't do an American accent without raising the right side of his upper lip. As Secret Service agent Mike Banning, Gerard Butler is tough (he boxes with the President), tender (he teaches the First Son all the ins and outs of White House security), and altruistic (he's married to a nurse who leaves it all on the ER floor, each and every day). So you know things aren't going to go well for Mike.The bad news - Ashley Judd is the First Lady. The good news - she gets a side order of limo rear window to the face and dies after plunging into the icy Potomac within the film's first five minutes.Then all the fun ends. Banning gets banished to a desk job at the U.S. Treasury because the mere sight of him now makes POTUS sad. As Banning's pushing paper, the White House suddenly and ridiculously gets taken over by a mob of angry North Koreans. Yes, kids, the No-Kos are Hollywood's new Nazis. Within minutes, virtually every agent guarding the Oval Office is dead, and the President, Vice President, and Secretary of Defense are being held hostage in the bunker by the Asian version of Dr. Evil. This guy even appears on a giant TV screen to taunt the Speaker of the House and the Secret Service Director, played by Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett - Central Casting's go-to people when a movie calls for stern, level-headed, well-spoken African Americans in positions of great power.Somehow, Banning manages to survive the hail of gunfire and sneak into the White House all by his lonesome to save the day. Fortunately, no one has bothered to remove Banning's White House security codes and passwords (even though it's been seven months since he was given the boot), which make it quite convenient for him to come to the rescue.But it's not all computers and electronic devices for Banning, no. When the No-Kos come at him with their guns, knives (you know how good those Asians are with knives, what with Benhihana Restaurant and all), and karate-kwon-do stuff, he takes 'em all down, one by one, until he finally reaches the Prez and walks him right out the front door.When you're not raising your palm to your forehead over the torrent of impossible situations, you'll be laughing out loud at the dialogue that practically writes itself. When taunted by the nasty No-Kos, for example, virtually every character sneers and growls, ""F**k you,"" including the President himself.

There were few minor misses. I looked for Morgan Freeman to show his usual calm under duress but here he looked dejected. A departure. The main action hero agent whats his name did not displayed any sense of fear while playing in den of deadly foes who occupied the White House, he simply wondered around room to room, sat in the Oval Office and made calls.

Good stuff with that all-around.Now let's get into the movie. And yes, I know it's ""just"" a movie. However, I found this movie beyond insulting to the people watching it. I know the average movie goer, like the average person, is not the smartest person in the world. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't even try. There are so many ""what the heck"" or ""Are you serious?"" moments. The characters do things that make zero sense whatsoever. Basically, there is so much wrong it's completely ridiculous. This movie is insulting to those watching it and especially those in the Secret Service and Armed Forces of this country. The decisions of the characters and the entire setup makes no sense. How easy they make it look to infiltrate the White House with like 40 Korean combatants versus the entire Secret Service (realistic), how simplistic they make it look to bury our country in a nuclear holocaust, UGH! Seriously? They try to do a few lines about the importance of Patriotism, but then the characters (even the President for God's sake!) are giving up national security secrets and protection because of what? The fear they'll kill the President? Cause we would EVER negotiate with terrorists? Come on!Okay, I know it's a popcorn flick, but it was just too much to bear.

How did Mike Banning believe that Forbes survived that brutal blitz on White House when his own mates died like puppets and still be the good guy?

Why did artists of the caliber of Antoine Fuqua, Melissa Leo, Morgan Freeman, and Ashley Judd (the wisest of them all, decided to dropout after copping it in first sequence) sign on for this caper? Too many questions, too many plot holes.

Then, the haunted male hero with his nightmarish failure to save the First Lady consuming him. Then, we have the rising global threat of terrorism in the Far East. The mix is already potent and putrid. Add Gerard Butler's average acting and it just becomes worse. The only one to come out of this muddled mess with some credibility intact is Rick Yune, who portrays Kang with twisted sadism.

The storyline follows a terrorist attack on the White House, masterminded by Kang Yeonsak, an ex-North Korean terrorist. Without giving away too many spoilers, the group eventually take control of the White House, with the president (Eckhart) held captive. The terrorists seem to have an answer for everything the Americans throw at them, however there is one remaining element which they failed to factor into their plan.. Gerard Butler. I know what you're thinking, how on earth could they be so negligent after all of that planning, right? You could draw a strong comparison to the storyline attached to 'Die Hard' and the Harrison Ford film 'Air Force One'. Unfortunately while I really enjoyed those films, Olympus Has Fallen is a pretty big disappointment in my opinion. The writing is painfully lazy, with countless plot holes which just leave you incredibly frustrated. Time after time, characters make terrible decisions which leave you baffled as to how they managed to acquire any form of political power in the film. I am aware there is a certain leniency taken into consideration when watching action films with thin story lines, but the gaping holes were unavoidable and had way too much impact in the film. Not only that, but the film has a very arrogant and self-righteous attitude, telling us how 'America is the greatest country in the world'.Maybe I am being too harsh, as I am sure there will be plenty of people who will enjoy this for what it is, but if you couldn't tell already it frustrated the hell out of me.

Movie starts with Gerard Butler's character miserably failing to save the first lady in a freak accident on a bridge. He is traumatized and even after 18 months he hasn't recovered from that guilt. Then we have a sudden invasion of terrorists from N. Korea with sophisticated demands. Thus the most protected building in the world has fallen. The American army which supposed to be the best in the world failed. The terrorist managed enter inside the president's emergency bunker and hold all necessary officials as hostages.

Here we have a John McLane type character Mike Banning played By Gerard Butler who just ends up inside while fighting, gets emotional to see all his friends dead on ground and sneaks inside the white house unnoticed and reached the oval office. I enjoyed the movie. It was a good 'thriller' as we sit at the edge of our seats until the whole thing just wraps up. But here are the logical reasons why this movie is less impressive.1. Generally the whole movie centers around this 'John McLane' named Mike Banning, and it if wasn't for him then the officials and everyone were helpless before the 40 terrorist as it is said. And he reaches in purely by luck and if he didn't? Generally Morgan freeman's characters and other people outside are not doing anything to save the president all the plans they make simply backfire them. 2. Surely is this movie is trying to show what happens when the 'Olympus' falls? With all the others hatred towards America like the terrorists here or the Middle East people celebrate when they heard about WH attack. 3. Sacrificing a nation for one. Sacrificed by those who all follow vows ""We won't go down without a fight"" and ""America don't negotiate with terrorists"". Well this is not negotiating, this is a direct order given by the terrorists so the officials have no other choice. 4. Giving the terrorist what they need will never save what they are holding as hostage, that is reality and above logic every terrorist one way or the shows that at the end. 5. Dumb fight scenes. Other secret service agents cannot fight the way Butler's character can. Well he has dealt with people like before haven't they?Overall this movie is about a one man army fight against a terrorist group that couldn't be defeated by a nation's fleet. Well the teens will enjoy it due to the action pack. 4/10",Olympus Has Fallen

OHF is one of the worst movies ever made. it is beyond any realm of drug induced believability and paints the United States military as being anything but competent - let's not delve into politics. First point; the POTUS would NEVER travel in a raging snowstorm with 4 entourage vehicles out of Camp David at night - absolutely ridiculous. Second point; any plane - especially an unmarked C 130 ""SPOOKY"" gunship - infiltrating the most restricted air space IN THE WORLD would be shot down MILES from the white house by more US Air Force F- 22's, F-16's, and F-15's than any terrorist could possibly imagine. This movie is really a noir- comedy. It has to be - how can anybody take it seriously. The screen play seems to have been written by middle school kids who wrote this while watching The Terminator or something. Other than the obvious ""for money"" why do such great actors agree to sully their reputation and ""star"" in this junk? I would give this ""movie"" no stars if I could. Terrible.

We can be pretty sure that a C130 and F22 Raptors will never duel above Washington DC. Second of all, we can all be pretty sure that the White House changes the security codes a little more often then the 18 months that have passed between the bridge accident and the ""falling"". Third of all, a lot of people are complaining that Secret Service agents are shooting at the C130 with normal assault rifles and submachine guns. What would you have them do, people? Hold up signs that say ""I surrender, shoot me""? Same excuse for the White House assault, Secret Service agents require to protect the president AT ALL COSTS. Despite the light machine gunfire from the street, what would you have them do??Yes, this will probably (and hopefully) never happen in real life, yes this movie is filled with clichés and yes some of the cast is really terrible (Dylan McDermott is really terrible in this movie), but does that mean the movie automatically deserves 1 out of 10? NO!!!

307,rahmannoodles22,Olympus Has Fallen - Noodels Review,7,19 December 2013,"I went into this movie with quite low expectations. Boy, was I surprised. Olympus Has Fallen is more than just a weekend popcorn flick; it's this generation's Die Hard (though not nearly as awesome as Die Hard). In a nutshell, this movie is the story of a former presidential guard who is the only survivor when the White House is captured by North Korean terrorists. Yes, North Koreans. In the 80's, it was Russians. In the early 2000's it was the Middle Easterners. Nowadays, it's the North Koreans who're the bad guys in all our movies.Anyway, it's all cliché in that the terrorists take the president and hold him for ransom from the government and, additionally, request codes for nuclear missiles. It's not like we haven't seen this before. But Olympus Has Fallen is actually a movie where this all works. Is it believable? Not really. Is it awesome and entertaining? Hell yeah! This movie is just filled with action and intensity, with a badass who saves the day. Gerard Butler's character is a very likable guy, cracking jokes and saving the day, but he also means business. Butler played him greatly and I couldn't help but compare him to John McClane while watching the movie (again, still not as awesome as John McClane but still pretty darn awesome). Aaron Eckhart, as well, was great in the movie. And there's Morgan Freeman; but we know what to expect from Morgan Freeman.Not only was the acting good and action entertaining, but the movie, itself, was very appreciative. Olympus Has Fallen is a movie that knows what it is. It's not trying to be an Oscar-winner, it's not trying to be a money maker (otherwise they would've made it PG-13). No, this movie is just straight-up what it is. Does that make sense? Probably not, but this movie knew what it was and it did what it aimed to do well: be entertaining and awesome.",Olympus Has Fallen

I felt this tense feeling throughout the whole movie, it was like it held the viewers in its hand. I was never bored for a moment i can tell you, something always happened, and it was entertaining. Creds for the fight scenes as well, it was brutal and they really made Butler look professional in this movie, he was fast, knew the right fighting tactics and it was intense, i really liked it. Although i would prefer that Morgan Freeman would be president and give us a hint that he was playing Obama and we never knew his name throughout the whole movie, just called ""The president"".

310,tradewinds68,Kick Ass Movie,10,26 August 2013,"***DEFINITE SPOILERS*** I have to say that I wasn't expecting this movie to be nearly as good as it was but I absolutely loved it. I run hot and cold on Gerard Butler but he really pulled out all the stops in this movie, as Secret Service Agent Mike Banning and talk about some hellishly good fight choreography! Angela Bassett is equally great as Secret Service Director Jacobs and Morgan Freeman as always provides a polished performance. Melissa Leo also gives a solid performance as Secretary of Defense McMillan. Basically, the North Koreans want to take back what they think they lost - South Korea. To do it they take the White House and hold the President, played well by Aaron Eckhart and kill off pretty much all the secret service agents except Mike Banning, who is a thorn in their side the whole way through the movie. What I really enjoyed was the complexity of the scheme to get into the White House and the way the movie was put together was seamless. Dylan McDermott also played a great role as a traitorous secret service agent, but the winner was the undoubtedly evil North Korean terrorist, Kang, played enthusiastically by Rick Yune from The Fast and the Furious. Not someone you would like to meet in a dark alley at night, unless, of course you were Mike Banning. I was disappointed that Ashley Judd didn't last for very long, I like her as an actress and Rahda Mitchell only had a fairly low-key role, but both were additions to the plot that I felt enhanced the storyline.",Olympus Has Fallen

So right away you know that in the end the bad guys aren't going to stand a chance against a true American patriot like agent Mike Banning. Gerard Butler plays the part very, very well and is quite good as an action hero. You find yourself really rooting for him to succeed in saving America from even more tragedy than what has already occurred. Ashley Judd has a small part as the warm and loving First Lady and mother of the President's son Connor(Finley Jacobsen). Aaron Eckhart is solid as the President of the United States and Rick Yune plays the part of the North Korean terrorist bent on destroying America ""to a T"". Last but not least, Morgan Freeman is Speaker of the House Martin Trumbull who assumes the Presidency while the President is held captive.Olympus Has Fallen has a solid plot, and you hope that God forbid a scenario like this could never happen in real life. The action and the special effects are fantastic. You are engrossed in this movie from start to finish, it delivers as promised.As I sat there and enjoyed this movie, a thought came to mind. If Morgan Freeman were to really run for President of the United States, he might actually get a lot of votes.

I wanted to see ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" and now I wish I hadn't bothered.This is the story of an attack on Washington, D.C.—more specifically, The White House—by a rogue North Korean faction. President Asher and the Veep are held hostage, leaving the Speaker of the House in charge and hilarity ensues. The problem is this: the movie was not supposed to be funny.This film bases itself on the premise that there are so many lapses in security in our nation's capital that you can just take over the The Executive Mansion. If you know even the basics about how we protect ourselves, you have to laugh at this film. Without going into the tedious details, let's just say I was surprised that 18 months after he left the presidential detail, our hero, Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), still has all his passwords and knows the combination to the safe in the Oval Office. He was removed from the president's side after the most implausible car accident ever put on film. It could not have occurred unless laws of physics were changed, the president's car was made of plastic, and every agent on the president's detail violated just about every safety protocol. In this turkey, President Asher, played by Aaron Eckhart, comes off as a complete whimpy moron who apparently has not been briefed about any security procedures. We also learn our Army and Air Force are ill prepared for any kind of attack. They don't recognize a disguised plane in much the same manner that Ricky never Recognized Lucy when she wore a wig. Somehow, these terrorists found all kinds of weapons, including an armoured car and a vintage bomber, with the ease of a shopping trip to Walmart.Morgan Freeman, who plays the Speaker of the House, is thrust into the scenario as acting president; he looks like he is phoning it in. I guess he was disappointed he didn't get to play the real president. I wonder if he is only allowed to be president when asteroids are approaching Earth. I was also surprised to learn that the head of the secret service makes the call and appoints him acting president. If you buy into any of this BS, the movie has a few good action scenes as our hero (Butler) steps over the bodies of what seems like everyone in the White House to try and save the president, his son, and the world in another implausible scene. I won't spoil it for you, but let's just say that if the president was shot, he would not be allowed to walk to the ambulance.The action scenes and a great exchange between ""Super Agent""and some North Korean gunmen gets this movie all the way up to a poor one out of Fordyce. This film is now playing at the Ultra Star Mary Pickford in Cathedral City, but there are several screens there, so you might want to try another movie.Credit Check: Even I didn't stay.

339,Reiko_95,RIDICULOUS copy of die hard,1,28 June 2013,"this ridiculous attempt of a film is trying to be something and succeeds big time and that is a ridiculous copy of die hard. what it fails terribly at, is actually portraying the real thing called die hard, and even more, surpass it. what were the film makers trying to do? copy die hard only on a grander, more apocalyptic and exaggerated scale? apparently so. it's just one of those movies (and there are a lot of those these days, sadly) where the trailer is awesome but the real thing sucks big time. this is policy nowadays in the movie industry, (especially the so called horror pictures where nothing happens for 70 minutes and in the last 20 minutes, they cram all the action and the gore in... pathetic) in that is, to show a top-notch trailer only to lure the viewers into theaters, and take their money for watching an (exagerrated) idea (in this case) of America gone to hell or in general, an idea and characters that could have been developed a lot better had the time and interest been spent more wisely and more responsibly. this film may very well stand as inspiration to the bad guys that actually might have something up their sleeves in terms of (future acts of)terrorism. i mean what are the film makers trying to do by showing this film to the world? give terrorists ideas on how to attack America? God forbid. Then again, sadly, the possibility is there. damn shame. a ridiculous copy of die hard which doesn't even stand up to it. 2 hours of my life gone down the drain. i really tried to like this movie, but i found nothing that could make me care for any of the characters, not to mention Morgan Freeman's talent wasted on a 2-hour ridiculous so called call to arms. he can do better than that, that i'm sure of and examples are quite a few, e.g Shawshank Redemption just to name one, and the list goes on. the film started out nice, pompous and all, but just like a balloon after the first half hour mark, it started to show clichés after clichés, only to fall flat on its a** by the end, and with a bang. you want a good action flick? watch die hard, at least the idea in it is original, and not inspired or copied with slight modifications here and there. in conclusion: a lot of potential wasted on a flick reeled out on cue in a hurry only for the purpose of cash flowing like water from a waterfall and with little regard to the audience's needs in terms of appreciation.",Olympus Has Fallen
340,Buscatcher,Got a hangover and want a snooze go see,5,12 May 2013,"Some have called this Die Hard in the White House well this is a damn sight better than the recent effort from that particular franchise (then again most movies are). Here we have Gerard Butler doing what 200 odd bodyguards/special agents can't. After being bosom buddies with and No.1 bodyguard to the President - Aaron Eckhart our hero finds himself desk bound after a car crash in which he fails to save the 1st lady. Luckily enough his new office is just a block or two away from The White House, so when a heavily armed bunch of naughty North Koreans (the new bad guys du jour in Hollywood) take control of The White House our hero is a mere caber toss away from kicking some N Korean bottom which he jolly well does. The cast also features Samuel L Jackson playing the acting president in his absence ably assisted by Angela Bassett an old pal of our hero. Aside from swatting those nasty Koreans Butler remains buff, rugged and handsome for ladies in Cinemas across the globe (certainly the screening I viewed this had more than its fair share of ladies). The plot is so so the characterisation so so and the direction likewise. If you want to see a bit of eye candy on a killing spree this is perfect though. The best thing about this movie is it has bucked the trend of recent movies of this ilk in not pandering to the censors to gain a more lucrative 12A rating; hang your heads in shame the makers of Die Hard 5 and Taken 2. Go see this if you've had a heavy night and want to clear your hangover and have an afternoon doze otherwise save your money.",Olympus Has Fallen
341,Onthethreshold,Quite a ridiculous proposition...,6,15 August 2013,"I think Hollywood is getting seriously desperate for story ideas because I remember back in 1997 when 'AIR FORCE ONE' was released and how essentially ""Olympus Has Fallen"" replicates such. Only difference is the plot is in the White House proper versus the Flying White House.Without getting too much into detail, the entire premise of this movie is ludicrous as is the notion the White House could ever be taken in the fashion portrayed here. I actually sat there laughing at the entire scene because it's so implausible. I know action flicks are going to be unreal to some extent but not to the point of living in some alternate reality world that completely distorts any semblance of the real world. Meaning there has to be at least some possibility of the events happening to make the movie enjoyable and here, despite the decent cast of actors, the film fails miserably.I'd even go a step further and suggest that much of the script here was ripped off from 'Air Force One' which in my view was an infinitely better film and much more plausible despite it's being highly unlikely.So I give this movie 6 stars because I like Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart. They try their best to make it work but in the end you have to wonder after watching the movie themselves they don't regret the choice. Especially for Freeman whose presence in a movie like this obviously has it's roots entirely in the money he's being paid and where his stature lends the credence to get people willing to pay enough to watch it. (Clearly he's a much better actor deserving of more decent roles)",Olympus Has Fallen
342,Yarayaraman,Fall Hard,2,21 August 2014,"To start with, there is enough action and suspense to 'enjoy' this film, making the 2 rating seem particularly harsh. Not a rating I give lightly. If you can forget/forgive the issues below you could treat this as a modern Die Hard rip off and enjoy it. Compared with the last Die Hard, it is arguably better, thus 2, not 1.The reason for the harsh rating is that while I fully expected a ridiculous story line, over the top special effects, customary flag waving, racism dressed up as patriotism and clunky dialogue, Olympus Has Fallen takes all of these things to a whole new level! All this would be fine, if everyone in it didn't seem to be taking this so damn seriously, reaching the point of being shoved down your throat so blatantly as to be regarded as a (poor) propaganda film, with some attempted 'witty' dialogue but little hint of sarcasm, right down to the final speech.What is more surprising is that this is the same director that brought us Training Day, which is a great film. Not sure how he got from there to here, but here you are.",Olympus Has Fallen
343,MovieMaster95,What a dumb and miserable experience,1,31 July 2013,"Let me start by saying, I'm a big action fan. Die Hard, Commando, Dirty Harry, most of John Woo's movies, I love 'em. But I can't think of a really good R-rated action movie that has come out in the last 10 years. Most modern day action movies are either PG-13 kiddie flicks with explosions every two minutes or boring, trying too hard action movies like this one that think a lot of mindless violence is all you need to make a satisfying movie. So 'Olympus Has Fallen' is a Die Hard clone. They're nothing wrong with that, the Die Hard formula has a lot of potential. Many action movies of the 90s tried to do this, my personal favourite being 'Sudden Death' with Van Damme. But what worked in that movie doesn't work here. First off, this movie is stupid. Real stupid. How the hell did the Asher guy become President in the first place? He's constantly making bad decisions based on his sentimentality. I know he's only human but common, he's the president. He almost got the whole country blown up because he wouldn't keep his mouth shut. Also once the US government found out about the terrorists plans, why not make an executive decision and just blow up the white house before they get all the codes? They'll be killing all the innocent people inside but at least they'll save the country. Then there's that part where they pretend to kill off the president in the dumbest way possible. Why does everyone except Banning believe the president is dead even though they didn't clearly see him get on the helicopter? Why on Earth did they think the terrorist would kill himself for no reason? Is everyone except Gerard Butler's character a complete idiot. I heard some people call this film racist, but it's Americans who should be really offended. Next problem, the film is dull. I hate CGI explosion and blood splatter and I also hate action scenes that have been done to death. The whole movie is robotic in pacing and instead of building up tension, it just drags. How many times can we see Butler choke, stab and headshot badguys with ease. It gets boring really quick. What's worked so well in Die Hard is that Bruce Willis was extremely vulnerable. He could take his share of punishment, but he had to rely on his wits and ingenuity to survive and defeat the badguys. In Die Hard, McClane's first kill in the movie is mostly by sheer luck, as they fall down a flight of stairs and McClane snaps his neck. In 'Olympus Has Fallen' Gerard caps off a few goons on his way into the White House and then later, when he's out of ammo, you think it's going to get exciting but no, he easily stabs another mook to death and already he's armed again. You can have a near indestructible hero in an action movie. As mentioned above, I do like Schwarzenegger movies like Commando, but that's because they're goofy and light-hearted popcorn flicks. Which brings me onto my third and final point. This movie is way too serious. Another thing Die Hard did right was never taking itself too seriously. There's a lot of humour in that movie that offsets the darker moments beautifully. In this movie however, the darkness is pumped up to 11 and it never lets up. There's a few one liners here and there but it never makes this movie any more enjoyable. From innocent people being gunned down in the streets and later being seen horrible mutilated in hospital, to a woman being brutally beaten by the sadistic terrorists, the movie is just unpleasant to watch. I know they want us to hate the villains but they didn't have to go this far. A movie like this should be a fun and tongue-in-cheek. The movie you can put on at any time and have a great time. But it's not. Everything's ultra-serious and depressing which really doesn't blend well with the over-the-top action. Just because it's an R-rated movie, it doesn't mean it has to keep a straight face throughout. This movie was just a miserable experience for me. Whoa, I wrote a lot. And I didn't even get into all the melodrama and patriotism throughout this movie. Like how no one cares about all the deaths in this movie, until the president is supposedly dead. Oh no, it's not like they won't have another one to replace him. Anyway there's my rant. I honestly can't think of a single thing I liked about this movie.",Olympus Has Fallen
344,D-Gal,"Action packed - Gripping performances - Unrealistic, though highly entertaining",8,10 April 2016,"This is the second time I've watched this film, and I liked it just as much as the first time I watched it. I've always been a logical thinker since I was able to understand things in life fully, and some of the things strike me as highly unlikely or improbable in this film, but though as seemingly far- fetched and unrealistic as ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is, it's a great film to just shut the logical side of your brain off, wind down and simply enjoy the thrill-ride of sheer action and suspense. The film is predictable and somewhat overly patriotic at times (especially the ending), but it's still awesome fun and leaves you hanging on for the ride. The scrip was pretty good, the acting was excellent and the characters were kind of 2 dimensional but the atmosphere of the film itself makes it feel less important. I was pretty bummed about the special effects to be completely honest though. For a film that had a 70 million dollar budget, you'd think they'd put in a little extra time and effort making the special effects look somewhat real at least; surely the actors weren't paid so much that cuts were made to CGI. It seemed a little, how do I say it... Cartoony? Oh well, the special effects were only a tiny portion of the film, I guess. I'm yet to watch the sequel to this film, ""London Has Fallen"", and I'm not expecting a flawless film at all, but although it may be just as far-fetched and implausible as the first film, I'm hoping my point of view will be very similar; fun-filled, action packed goodness. If you're a person who enjoys some excellent shoot 'em up scenes with a story that makes sense though as improbable as it may be, then this film is definitely for you! If solid action doesn't particularly fit in your area of enjoyment, then avoid this film and watch something else. 8/10. Great fun!",Olympus Has Fallen

The story is so tilted and poorly executed you don't really have to follow the story at all.You know the outcome after 10 minutes and after that you just wait for it to unfold.If you want to watch pure action i would recommend the old die hard movie instead it has better acting.If you want a invasion attack movie i think Red dawn from 1984 also does that better.I somehow don't get the feeling its the actors fault this movie fell so flat on its face i think its the people behind the camera to blame on this one.",Olympus Has Fallen

349,findingdevotion,Not even close to Die Hard,3,14 April 2013,"I know the movie was pitched as a Die Hard clone, but even at that it's a miserable failure, so miserable that's baffling.Does Gerard Butler have Willis' 'cool' action hero stance? Well, almost, but it's close enough. So where did this movie go wrong?First of all, the premise. In Die Hard, the premise was simple: some bad guys chose a target that just happened to be in McClane's proximity. That's simple and it can be sold. In Olympus has Fallen, the target the friggin' White House, in USA. How does a heavy military plane enter US airspace unchecked, let alone the DC area unchecked (yeah, it says USAF, but I guess any control tower would have launched an alert when the aircraft didn't identify itself, long before coming close to the city)? How does an army of Asian tourists manage to get an arsenal of war? How does a handful of terrorists manage to replace an ENTIRE diplomatic mission save for the top guy? That story can't be sold even to three year olds.In Die Hard, it's all about McClane's cool, humor and flair. It's all about action and killing bad guys. In Olympus has Fallen, too much cheap American cheap ""patriotism"" is injected, so much that it's painful. The film is plagued with a couple of cheap ""our way of life"" speeches which take away the fun for the moment and have the audience roll their eyes and exclaim: really??.The action scenes are competent, but there's no suspense there. It's like Fuqua decide to inject cheese into a competent recipe, completely and utterly spoiling it.In Die Hard, you had one experienced cop proving to be right in front of a bunch of other cops. I can dig that. In Olympus has Fallen, you have one insignificant and disgraced Secret Service agent (also experienced) who at one point tries to teach foreign policy to the entire defense structure of the US: generals, the CiC, etc. That doesn't fly in a million years.In Die Hard, you had simple terrorist demands: money, revenge, etc In Olympus has Fallen, a terrorist tries to dictate US policy and international treaties while holding one man at gunpoint. He's may be The President, but he's one man. There's no reason to sacrifice a country and world peace for one man. Also, the entire plot can be solved with basic logic: you cut White House hardlines, there's no way Cerberus could be activated, even with the correct codes.In addition, the real system which in the movie is given the name Cerberus doesn't detonate the rogue missile: it simply switches off the engine and blows the warhead. It doesn't initiate the nuclear reaction which results in a nuclear explosion but burns the nuclear load so that it won't be used if found.",Olympus Has Fallen

Gerard Butler plays a believable and compelling hero, hard-nosed and devoid of annoyances that limit most action stars. I hope he makes more movies with his Mike Banning character; I will go. Also, the first half hour is both highly dramatic and highly realistic, inspiring in me feelings I've not felt that intensely since 9/11. (PTSD warning!)The remainder stays dramatic and engaging, but realism slips. Fortunately, I was attached to the lead character and invested in the plot by that point, so I didn't give up. But I sure did a fair amount of whispered griping. By the time Morgan Freeman recalled the 7th fleet (Would! Not! Happen!), my girlfriend will attest that I was about ready to run up to the screen and strangle the president myself.Coming out of the theatre, I had mixed feelings. But dang it, I sure did feel like I'd just ridden a pretty good roller coaster! So I figured it out quick: Yes, because of the way it started, I thought this was gonna be a more serious take on the story concept. And the movie disappointed me in that regard.

This is nothing that drastically changes my view on the film though, don't worry. My main concern with it was that it is all recycled material from other films.

357,FlixChatter,"The spirit of patriotism is so high in this movie, there's absolutely no room for subtlety",6,23 March 2013,"I was wondering the other day if it's possible to find a review of this movie that does not mention the words Die Hard. Seems that the comparison is inevitable and it seems that Olympus Has Fallen is begging for a comparison. In fact, perhaps it's an homage to that action franchise, as it's more akin to the spirit of the original Die hard movie than its official sequel.If you've seen the trailer, then you'll know the plot. The White House is being attacked by a group of North Korean terrorists and hold the president hostage. As is with a lot of 90s action flicks, there is only one person who could save the day and that man is Mike Banning (Gerard Butler). The first ten minutes or so of exposition reveals a tragic event during his day as a Presidential guard. 18 months later, Banning is confined to a desk job and even as time passes he's still consumed with regret that he let his boss and friend, that is President Asher, down. So naturally, he's more than eager to redeem himself when the chance presented itself one sunny Summer day. The attack comes hard, fast and vicious. The first attack came from above, but instead of a space ship, practically the entire Washington DC is sprayed with bullets from an air carrier, and within minutes, the supposedly most secure building in the entire free world is reduced to rubble with dead bodies piling up on its grounds.The words fresh and original aren't likely to be associated with this film, but it certainly stays completely true to its title. Olympus indeed has fallen, and Antoine Fuqua doesn't pull any punches with the brutality of how it goes down. It's rated R for a reason, it's violent and bloody. I lost count how many people getting shot in the head at close range and all the severe stabbings. Banning himself has no qualms in *taking care* of the enemies. He seems to subscribe to the same ""No mercy! No surrender!"" motto as his most famous role in 300, but with a bit more humor thrown in. Some of the one-liners did deliver some laughs, especially his defiant quips at the Pentagon folks, though Butler's character not quite as charismatic as Bruce Willis' John McClane as the script lacks some serious wit.Unfortunately it's lacking in common sense as well. Granted, the believability factor depends on whether you'd believe a group of extreme terrorists could deliver such a blow to the United States. The thing is, I don't know how such a big aircraft could enter our airspace, passing through Andrew Air force Base, without being shot down? The security forces are so quickly rendered powerless it's as if they've never been trained to respond to emergency attack whatsoever. But the biggest plot blunder of all is how Banning is still able to get security clearance once he's inside the President's compound as he's technically no longer part of the Service. Yet could still use his thumb print to gain access, has the right code to open a safe, etc. as if he's never left! I mean, they didn't change authorization codes every time there's a shift in the security personnel? WOW, some *security* huh? Now, I can't possibly write this review and not mention the cheesy special effects. I get that this is a throwback to 90s action blockbuster, but do they have to throw in 90s SFX as well?? It gets distracting at times, especially during the ambush scene in broad daylight. Fortunately things get better and grittier as the day progresses, and the action gets more up-close with more hand-to-hand combat between Butler and whoever is unlucky enough to get in his way. Butler is utterly believable as a bad ass special forces, he's definitely credible in action flicks and as a one-man army. Yet he's not wooden or vacant like many action stars, he still brings a touch of humanity to the role as the mission is a personal one for his character. There's some emotional resonance in his scenes with Aaron Eckhart as the beleaguered POTUS, and also with his young son.The supporting cast are stellar but not really given much to do. We've seen Eckhart and Morgan Freeman in far better roles, but their presence did add gravitas to the project. Melissa Leo got more screen time than I though but I'm disappointed that the still-athletic Angela Bassett didn't get to do any butt-kicking in this movie! I was sure she would get to do some of that when she was cast as the head of Secret Service. Rick Yune pretty much rehashed his role as Bond villain in Die Another Day as the villainous mastermind Kang who's hellbent to get his hands on US nuclear missiles. I guess he's serviceable but nothing more, a far cry from the iconic performance of say, Hans Gruber, as Kang is neither menacing nor entertaining. I'd say the characters of Dylan McDermott and Radha Mitchell could've been left in the cutting room floor and they won't make a dent.The spirit of patriotism is so high in this movie, there's absolutely no room for subtlety. A torn down American flag being thrown by the bad guys from rooftops falls in slow-motion as a patriotic score comes on, there are plenty of moments like this and I can't help but feel a bit emotional despite its corny sentimentality.Despite all the flaws though, I still think this one is not a bad movie. In fact, it's actually quite entertaining and action fans should be pleased to see the relentless combat scenes and countless shootouts. There's also a decent level of suspense overall, and I definitely feel a pang in my gut seeing our leaders being violated in such a way. The subject matter of terrorism is sadly still relevant to this day, and at times it really hit close to home.",Olympus Has Fallen

359,claudio645,Another Under Siege Sequel?,1,13 September 2013,"I'm not going to rehash all the negative reviews already posted here. This is truly a bad movie. The government, police and military are all portrayed as either stupid or incompetent. The bad guys have more resources than any terrorist organization could ever have. Al- Qaeda wishes they had the weaponry these guys have somehow managed to gather and bring to bear on the White House, all without anyone getting suspicious. It's completely unbelievable the US government would rather lose Korea than let the President die. Officials give up codes when they're the only reason to keep those people alive. It would take code breakers at least 3 days to break all three codes (according to the plot) but only 10 minutes to break one?This movie follows a formula used many times with varying results. The first Die Hard used it well. The Rock was fun. Both kept enough realism to make it believable and they kept the scope of the plot fairly minimal. It's believable that a city police force might make some mistakes dealing with big-time terrorists. Having the entire US government, military and Intelligence community act like mall cops is not. This feels like somebody spent a week watching a Steven Seagal marathon, then took everything bad about those movies and rolled them up into one giant bull__t burrito.I can completely suspend belief if an action movie is ""comic booky"" like Shoot 'Em Up. When it feels more like a propaganda film my intelligence is insulted. To anyone who paid good money to see this film I'm sorry. To all the good actors involved in this travesty, you owe moviegoers a big, fat apology. Come out and say you needed the money or that the script looked better than the final result. They should be ashamed to have their names in the credits.",Olympus Has Fallen
360,Danielramos16,"Yippee-ki-yay, Mr. President!!!",7,28 March 2013,"Watching this film brought back many Die Hard memories, and yes everyone is saying that this is pretty much Die Hard in the White House. I can't argue with that. This film is actually a hell of a lot better then that recent disaster A Good Day to Die Hard. It's like Gerard Butler was getting in touch with his inner John McClane. All said this film is an awesome action flick, despite it's cliché moments, plot holes, and American vomiting patriotism.Gerad Butler plays Mike Banning, a former U.S. Army Ranger turned Secret Service agent in charge of the Presidential Detail. Banning is close to President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), the First Lady (Ashley Judd), and their son Connor. After a tragic car accident that results in the death of the First Lady, Banning is basically demoted to a desk job at the Treasury Department near the White House. One day a group of terrorists launch a coordinated attack on the White House and take the President hostage. During the attack Banning manages to shot his way into the White House. With the White House under terrorist control, the president hostage, and U.S. forces powerless, its up to Mike Banning to take down the Terrorists from the inside, before they succeed in their terrifying plot to destroy the United States.What I enjoyed most about this film was that It was almost like a nostalgic trip to those awesome action flicks on the 90s like Die Hard, Air Force One, and Under Siege. Its has this old school action style to it which brought back many fond memories of the Die Hard themed action flicks. If you love the adrenaline rush of an action film then you'll love this movie. I suppose Olympus has Fallen doesn't really offer anything original, and one might pick out some obvious flaws. Do the terrorists realize that their actions would result in the total destruction of their own country? How the heck did the terrorists get their hands on an AC-130 Spectre gunship? Where did they get that super advanced anti-aircraft defense system? Would the President and his staff really give up such top secret information to save each other when they are risking the lives of millions of people, and the well being of the whole country!? and how did Morgan Freeman become President of the United States Again?Despite that this film is still a lot of fun. The action is intense, bloody, and unrelenting. Gerard Butler has this commanding presence that you'd expect from an action star. He plays Mike Banning as a hard working professional rather then falling into that cliché disgraced hero looking for redemption role. He kicks ass, he cracks clever one liners, hes not invincible he bleeds and hurts, and come across as a more believable hero compared to some of the other crap action stars we've seen here and there. We get a great performance from a great supporting cast led by Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and Melissa Leo. The main villain played by Rick Yune is ruthless and smart, which makes him a more terrifying character. I could see Rick Yune in the same mold as many of thos epic Die Hard Villains. Every great hero needs a great villain. To its credit you do end up rooting for Gerard Butler, you are kept interested, and you are kept thinking what will happen next. This film is what the recent Die Hard movie should have been, and for that I give this film high marks.",Olympus Has Fallen

362,mattslim333,"It's good, but it's not quite White House Down.",8,17 July 2015,"I like Antione Fuqua, his films are often well-written and tense. Olympus has Fallen is certainly tense, with the opening action set piece and the climax of the movie. However this tension is not there in the middle half of the film, and it plods along without much story development in the 2nd act. Despite this, Olympus has Fallen is still pretty enjoyable. The acting from Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler is impressive, and the supporting cast do a good job too. I didn't like the score, it didn't really add to the movie at all and never ramped up the tension like a good score should. This is quite a minor problem, amongst a enjoyable film.Despite this, we must compare it to White House Down, a film of similar nature. I much preferred WHD, as it's comic verve in the script make it less plodding and the pacing is much better than Olympus has Fallen. The overall films are both good, but WHD is better in a variety of ways.Olympus has Fallen, then, is a enjoyable action film with good acting performances, but lacks the comedy that WHD has and I think the action is actually more exciting in said film. However, Olympus has Fallen is good fun nonetheless and is definitely good popcorn entertainment, but it certainly won't win any awards.",Olympus Has Fallen

Complete garbage, between the sterile, ridiculous plot line that takes it's self far, far too serious, to the brutally bad acting, I shut this one down 39 minutes into the film. The fight scenes were so shockingly bad, with secret service agents seemingly suddenly without any training leaping into the path of flying bullets rather than taking any cover. If a director decides to take their plot line with serious intent more effort has to go into creating realistic scenes. The opening few minutes of the storming of the white house is just beyond any realm of suspension of disbelief. The whole premise from the start was so disappointing and based on hard core stereo typed views. I mean think about it for even 1 minute. Would North Korea, really want to take over the White House? Really? When American subs are parked off their coast with nuclear weapons? Would America even think about negotiating with N.K? This movie should have been left on the cutting room floor. Do yourself a favor and bail on this one. Olympus has fallen all right, right to the bottom of the must see list.",Olympus Has Fallen
365,akik1259,American Pride: The Movie,7,22 March 2013,"I walked into his movie expecting a straightforward bloody action movie with a determined hero, and that's pretty much what I got. Gerard Butler plays a U.S. special forces agent who is forced to stop a group of Korean terrorists who attack the White House and kidnap the president, played by Aaron Eckhart. The U.S. government must formulate a plan to stop them before it is too late (not spoiling). It is clear from the get-go that these terrorists mean business and that gives you a sense of dread as they attack and kill innocent people.Not to sound morbid, but the attack on the White House is a fantastic scene (although it is unclear just how these terrorists got so close in the first place). There are lots of explosions that would make Michael Bay proud, although the CGI is a bit shaky. There are also at least 5 shots of the U.S. flag waving prominently. I was on edge through that entire scene. Gerard Butler is a bad-ass here. He knows his mission and is determined to succeed. He is very reminiscent of Bruce Willis in Die Hard and Liam Neeson from Taken. The way these terrorists act, you will end up rooting for him. Aaron Eckhart plays the president and he plays it just fine. Morgan Freeman plays the Speaker of the House and most of the time he looks like he is extremely stressed out (in real life). The move is pretty straightforward, but it works. If you can suspend your disbelief it is a pretty fun ride. The movie is very bloody and violent and there are a LOT of head-shots. There is some genuinely funny dialogue and one-liners delivered by Butler that had the audience giggling and that should be enough to keep you going.Now some negative things: the movie is derivative of several others, most notably Die Hard, Taken, and Rambo. Nothing very original here. The acting is a little on the stale side for the most part, the score is overly dramatic at times, like it's trying to make you feel emotion, and the CGI explosions look downright fake at times.In the end this is a fun popcorn movie with an patriotic flavor. Although it's not the least bit original, you will come out of it loving America at least a little bit more.",Olympus Has Fallen
366,bn229,Set logic aside and suspend the veil of disbelief,5,13 April 2020,"For a film with a budget of $70 million (reportedly), and with the big names attached to it (Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Rick Yune, Dylan McDermott, Ashley Judd), you'd think that they could have afforded to hire a good team of script supervisors. As many reviewers here have noted, the film had plenty of plot holes.With that said, if you set logic aside and suspend the veil of disbelief, it is actually a rather action-packed thrill ride. Considering the resources that were at the disposal of the filmmakers, it was a wasted opportunity. It could easily have been an 8-star film if they had just re-tooled the ... well, I don't want to write any spoilers. If they had re-tooled the way in which the terrorists initially subdue the White House, it would have been more believable.But then there are several other plot points that would need to be addressed, too.There are some pluses to the film. For me, the moment when Morgan Freeman (the Speaker of the House who is now Acting President of the United States during the crisis) rises mighty above the general, shouts him down and puts him in his place ... it was wonderful.

The difference between a good action movie and a mediocre one is that the former contains well- developed, understated characters that don't beg you (the audience) for attention. ""Show, not tell"" is the most important lesson they teach you in drama school, unfortunately too many movie-makers ignore these basics thus, driving their entire plot into clichéd territory. Whereas Expendables 2 made a strong impression due to deadly performances by French-accented Jean Claude Van Damme and Jason Statham, Olympus has fallen fails to make the mark despite some edge-of-the-seat excitement and a brilliant storyline. It's nice to have ceaseless gunfire, helicopter attacks and rogue nukes all over the screen but they should remain in the backdrop.I repeat, NOTHING can replace method acting, especially when you have a cast like Aaron Eckhart (Thank you for Smoking), Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler. Freeman looked tired and bored whereas Butler was too busy being badass, his character didn't come alive despite being portrayed as a one-man demolition machine. But, he still has a few cheeky one-liner moments against the Korean villain Kang and the United States government, but don't you see, anyone in that situation would have reacted with the same sense of humour.

372,landinathome,A subtle attack on America,1,24 March 2013,"This movie was so full of objectionable depictions of America that I was astounded. The only redeeming quality in the entire movie was the character of Mike Banning who was a tough guy willing to do whatever was necessary to get the job done. I really appreciated that, and I suspect that our special forces and our secret service men and women are very similar (maybe not quite so over the top).Objections: Almost everyone else in the movie, from the men guarding the White House to the Speaker of the House were a bunch of mealy-mouthed weaklings with no policies with which to respond to a terrorist attack or a hostage situation. Our president is not our ""Dear Leader"" and the idea that our entire way of life would be threatened if our president was held hostage is utterly ridiculous. But what I hated most was the implication that the North Korean's have a legitimate gripe with us. North Korea is a country where one man dictates to the rest; where one citizen is of no value; where all men are equally worthless. They make no apologies for these principles, they make no apologies for the millions of citizens that have already starved to death, and they make no apologies for the millions of political prisoners who dared to speak out against the ""Dear Leader"". We in the USA, on the other hand, have adopted a different set of principles where each individual citizen is valuable and our entire government is (or at least was originally) designed to protect the rights of each individual. These principles have allowed us to flourish and prosper. The North Koreans (and other dictatorships) don't want to adopt similar principles -they could- but they don't want to. Instead, they want us to feel guilty and responsible when their people continue to starve and die. I don't buy it.I do realize this is a movie review and not a political forum, but the movie did try to make a political statement and I think it warrants an answer.",Olympus Has Fallen

Olympus Has Fallen is the movie that has everything you were waiting to see. Thankfully, Bruce Willis is on vacation ( just like he claimed several times, in Die Hard 5). So, he is nowhere to be seen, thankfully.

So, like it for what it is, but don't hate it for what it isn't. It's not meant to be a serious, edgy and visceral movie.

The flaws won't take away the fun you'll have with the flick.The movie is not for kids or babies. It's very violent and they don't hold any punch regarding the display of violence and brutality on screen. Woman, men, that doesn't matter. Headshots, impalings, explosions and lots of deaths.

I mean, it would have looked great 10 years ago, but now it seems every object is made of plastic/clay, which makes me think they forgot to add the textures. That aside, because many great movies didn't have great special effects, I think the security measures that terrorists try to exploit just are secure at all. Imagine a coke can without its opening thingie. That would be harder to get into than the white house portrayed on this movie. Somehow, the villains manage to hit every civilian and law enforcement personnel with a bullseye to the chest/head while firing randomly from an aircraft. Well, of course they hit everyone except our hero, our knight in shiny armor that desperately tries to shield the population behind cars (from clearly ""car-piercing"" ammunition?). Somehow the villains just go to the white house fence, make a hole in it and kill everyone. And remember the big guns the defenders took from the lockers? I guess they don't, or they wouldn't have faced 50 machine gun holding koreans with just handguns. But you know what? I guess the fence was the biggest line of defense, or the koreans wouldn't have to cross it before bringing the bazookas... Seriously, bad effects, everyone's hit except Mr. Butler, awesome accuracy from the bad guys while good guys just lay there, explosions... I respect film producers all the casts and crews and try to see every bad movie has a series of bad choices, so I'm not gonna say this movie isn't worth it, but you'll have to turn off your brain.What surprises me the most is that movies like this one reach Portuguese cinemas while a lot of good ones never did.",Olympus Has Fallen

My shoulder and neck hurt after having tilted my head to the side at the countless IMPLAUSIBLE and ridiculous moments in this film. And I expected it! I...I just can't. Okay, let me gather myself. Olympus Has Fallen is the Antoine Fuqua directed....WAIT...Fuqua directed this!? The man behind one of my favorite films Training Day directed this mockery?!? Tyler Perry makes a film a month and Fuqua gets stuck with crap stains like this? Sorry, sorry. Olympus Has Fallen is the...(gulp)...Antoine Fuqua directed film about a Korean attack on American soil. Sound familiar? Well it should. Because you just got through NOT seeing the same concept in the abysmal Red Dawn remake. Oh..oh this time it's the White House, not rural America. That'll make it better. NO! No. It doesn't.How does the White House....THE MOST secured building IN THE WORLD get taken over you ask?(SPOILER ALERT)An airplane with more countermeasures than a Transformer and the most organized attacking force I've ever seen in my entire life. Seriously. The Red Skull and Loki both wielding the cosmic cube couldn't organize an attack this precise and infallible. Patton himself running SkyNet robots couldn't pull off an attack this perfect. At one point I thought the entire population of downtown DC was just armed North Korean terrorists. They come out of nowhere and just happened to ALL get mere feet away from, again...THE MOST SECURED BUILDING IN THE WORLD. The supposed secret service decide the best way to stop a bunch of terrorist firing at them with a .50 cal is to just walk directly into the gunfire, bullets be damned. If it was revealed later that this film was produced by the government in order to get the North Koreans to attempt something this stupid and IMPLAUSIBLE in order to legitimize us kicking their asses then nuking them, I'd buy it.(END OF SPOILERS)Look, I try my best not to spoil movies here on the site. However, I find it to be irresponsible of me as a human being not to prepare you for whats in store if you do plan on seeing this film. And for those saying that this is like Die Hard in the White House...Like DIE HARD in any shape, form, or F*%KING capacity...shame on you. Shame...on...you. You need to slap yourself in the face three times, genuflect to the awesomeness that is John McClane, put in Die Hard, then write a ten page apology letter to Bruce Willis and John McTiernan (In prison) for ever uttering Die Hard in the same paragraph as Olympus Has Fallen.The acting in this is over the top. It is clichéd and wooden. It is paint by numbers. How can a film this stereotypically bad garner talent like Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, and...well Gerard Butler does anything nowadays. When Sly and his Expendables do films like these, we eat it up because they are being ironic and nostalgically nodding to their earlier classics. There are no expectations of weight to the performances. But when you start sprinkling in Academy Award nominees in a film like this, it feels like you just caught them slumming it with some alleyway street walker on the LA strip at three in the morning. They are all better than this. Even you Butler.Olympus Has Fallen is a big budget film that still has a direct to DVD feel. All the stars and horribly CGI-ed fireworks they throw at it still can't polish this turd of a film. If you watch it...brace yourself...then try to tell me I'm wrong.(Sigh) Well, at least this will probably be the last film using this stupid White House under siege plot for a while.

However, don't be fooled. Gerald Butler is the star of this show, and Gerald Butler's tired eyes 18 month after 'the incident' deserve whatever award for awarding actors with great performances that portray reality.Like Deep Impact and Armageddon in 1998, this has a parallel plot movie ""White House Down"" with Channum Tating starring as the hero. I've seen both, and I enjoyed both. Although the plot, scenery, weapons, setup, and other details remain the same, Gerald Butler played it serious all the way through. Channum Tating and Jamie Foxx however lived it up, having a good ole time kicking ass. Gerald Butler is the new Bruce Willis from Die Hard, who is having a rough time with the wife and calls her during the crisis with a hard tone in the voice.This movie and White House Down are both 7's, definitely both worth seeing, if you liked one you'll like the other.

383,graphixv,No worse than Air Force One,5,22 August 2014,"For what it is this film is no worse than Air Force One. It's certainly no masterpiece, it's a check your brain at the door film. Yes, the stuff in it makes no logical sense. I mean none. The worst offense in the entire film was probably when the seal team finally tries to enter the White House through the roof with some choppers and were rebuffed. At that point, why didn't they just storm the entire grounds with the troops and Humvees and tanks waiting across the street? They had nothing to lose.But, in a film like this asking too many questions is asking for trouble! Overall I would say this really wasn't worse than Air Force One and it actually reminded me of that one and In The Line of Fire. It's stuff blowing up, mindless explosions, a hokey overly contrived story that is a mixture of past action films and set pieces that make absolutely no sense.Even though it succeeds as a dumb action film, it does suffer from some bad CGI. The plane attack and the white house are not totally convincing (Bargain effects company?)",Olympus Has Fallen

Yes there are plot holes. Yes, the ""we will not negotiate"" followed by full-on capitulation is hilarious. Yes, saving the President over and above millions of South Koreans is ridiculous. Yes, casting North Koreans as the Bad Guys is tasteless bordering on crass.But it's surprisingly easy to put those objections (and more) to one side and just get carried along by the fast action and satisfyingly high body count.

Butler is supported by great ensemble of actors who are doing great job.

It seems like it takes it for granted that the viewer is a complete, gullible fool that will accept anything as long as it has guns and blood. Not a single part of this movie was anywhere near entertaining, and I spent the last thirty minutes just waiting for it to end. I could never stop a movie before it ended.SPOILERS BELOWThe White House is attacked by a rogue Korean terrorist group looking to teach America a thing or two about starvation and poverty. This is to be achieved by setting off every missile (or nukes only, this was never made entirely clear) in their silos, laying waste to large parts of America. To do this, they need access to something called Cerberus, which has three different codes they need to get. Luckily for them, the three different people that know these codes just happen to be in the White House at the same time. Great! Now, the difficult part is getting to the White House. Luckily for the terrorists, the US has absolutely no way of stopping an unidentified aircraft until it is literally right above the White House. And even then it's got a couple minutes to circle around and shoot innocent people. Now that they've got people's attention, a bus loaded with Korean tourists (turns out they're actually paramilitaries) and explosives will make its way straight through the front gates of the House.So after every single agent in the White House has been killed, and the Koreans have established base in the bunker below, there's only a single man left on the inside. And luckily for us, he's superhuman, makes no noise, feels no pain, has no emotions, and is a total bad-ass. Except he's not really a bad-ass, he's just plain bad. Queue terrible lines and 50 minutes of fighting and shooting.Fast forward those 50 minutes, the lone superhero wins the battle against the terrible North Koreans, shuts down this Cerberus program by inputting a code and waiting 5 seconds.

396,Cris_Drg,just enjoy it; bitch about it later.,8,19 September 2014,"I decided to write this after reading several negative comments about the lack of logic and so on. yeah, yeah, so what?This is a very entertaining movie. So it does have a few holes in the fabric of logic, but you're not going to notice them. Because it's that good. and fast. Yes, for once I would like secret service, army and police to not be dummies in front of enemy fire; you know, if Butler can see a missile coming, so can they. They are trained personnel, they should act like it.Also, I for one would not let a plane get so far into DC; and I wouldn't just ask them politely to buzz off. I'd say logic would qualify for such a plane to be shot down with no warning. You're above the city, you're not supposed to be here, you're heading for the White House, game over. And why would the pilots position their fighting planes at just the right level for the intruder's machine guns to wipe them out? any 10 year old with a computer and a flight simulator knows better. Anyways... there are lots of logic problems, BUT all of this could actually happen me thinks. If we consider that it all went down in 13 minutes, we add in the chances of less-smart individuals being part of army, police, etc, we add apathy and being caught off-guard by an incredibly bold, fast and very organized team of professionals that have inside information, and all of this could happen. Routine and not paying attention is responsible for lots of work-related accidents. There are 2 things that I find inexcusable though: 1. there's the army general who sends in the seals blindly and then refuses to abort even when it was obviously a losing move. And to top it, then tries to blame it on the one guy who's been doing all the great things. Now: why would the acting president NOT relieve this guy of command? he just proved incompetence and lack of integrity. what is he waiting for? full on treason? and 2. the most incredibly stupid president of all times, a moron with a savior complex who takes away the credit and dignity of all the other officials by ordering them to commit treason and put the entire country at risk. there is a reason why these codes to arm nukes are protected by different codes given to several different people. we don't expect him to be smart enough to know about code-breaking computer programs or the prisoner's dilemma, but how about respect for his colleagues? how about someone calling him out for being the weak link in the chain, the one that will destroy his country? how about telling him off? you know, have some back bone, some dignity - Mr. President, it is MY job to protect these codes, even if I die doing it. sorry, but what you ask me to do is treason (and possibly genocide), so... nope! you don't get to tell me what to do. (please notice I'm not saying anything about this guy actually creating the whole situation by over-riding his security protocols. because I'm sure this happens a lot - people are always disrespecting the rules that are meant to protect them; which is why this plot can actually happen to a certain degree). Of course we will never know how an abort mission protocol for nukes is actually blowing them up, but... whatever. Let's not let these details ruin the fun.

397,matsnowie,Weak Die Hard wannabe,5,5 September 2013,"So here's the thing about action movies: ever since Die Hard, Hollywood has been trying to make another Die Hard. They've done every variation of hostage situation including several more office buildings, they've done every type of non-American villain except Canadian, and they've given every macho leading man from Harrison Ford to Alec Baldwin (in 1990) a shot at the title. But even Bruce Willis as John McClane fighting Russian terrorists in A Good Day to Die Hard couldn't recapture the magic. Now it's Antoine Fuqua's chance to direct, and Gerard Butler's chance to play the hero. Are the elements that make up the bones of Die Hard present? Yes. Do they work? No.Secret Service agent Mike Banning (Butler) is kicked off the President's detail when he fails to save the First Lady from a car crash. Eighteen months later and he is working at the Treasury Department on the day that the South Korean delegation is visiting President Asher (Aaron Eckhart). Then a gunship bomber flies over DC and starts shooting at anything and anyone, tourist groups turn out to be heavily armed infantry, and part of the South Korean delegation turn out to be the bad guys. The fact that one of them is played by the diamond-faced villain from Die Another Day could have been a clue.With the President and VP taken hostage and the White House occupied, the government is handed over to Speaker of the House Morgan Freeman. He has a character name, but all you need to know is he's Morgan Freeman, which is good because that's all the filmmakers give you. Party affiliations and character development have no place in action movies.Something I hadn't considered in my excitement to see Die Hard at the White House was that the whole ""lone hero"" scenario requires removing the other heroes. Washington DC has a lot of possible heroes to remove, and this means that the debut siege is a bloodbath. This sequence is one of the most original in the film, and it feels like the part that got the script the green light, but it resembles Saving Private Ryan more than anything from the Nakatomi Building.It may be unfair for me to constantly compare this film to Die Hard, but I can easily see Gerard Butler's character going home to watch the Bruce Willis classic and saying, ""Why doesn't he just shoot them in the head? He should just shoot them in the head. Do you think he considered just shooting them in the head?"" I didn't even try to count how many Full Metal Jacket brain splatters were the result of Butler firing a perfectly-aimed shot.An essential part of the lone hero action film is the hero's motivation. It's not good enough that he wants to be a good guy and save everyone. John McClane would have left the building if his wife weren't in the hostages. The same goes for Harrison Ford in Air Force One. Gerard Butler's only motivation seems to be doing his job, which is fairly weak as far as action movies go.But, at the halfway point, the film did not deserve much scorn. It succeeded in delivering what the trailers promised, which was a lot of action in the relatively new setting of the White House. However, in the second half, there is a device introduced that rises to Dr. Strangelove levels of stupidity solely for the purpose of raising the stakes higher than they needed to go. Nothing is easier to mock than a ticking clock, and a couple of plot contrivances leading up to it doesn't help the believability.As far as action movies go, there have been plenty worse, and if you don't mind blood this was a worthy popcorn flick. It's not challenging or particularly well-crafted, but it does what it set out to do.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2013/03/olympus-has-fallen.html",Olympus Has Fallen
398,Br007,"Run, Don't Walk, To See This, The Most Unintentionally Funny Movie of the Year",5,24 March 2013,"Saturday Night Live won't have much trouble parodying this movie which had my friends and I grabbing our sides from the non-stop unintentional laughter it produced.From start to finish, almost every scene is laugh out loud funny. Most of the acting, save Freeman and Butler, is appalling. Though Ashley Judd is fine and, to her advantage, mercifully killed off a few minutes in to this laugh-fest. Bassett has absolutely nothing to do, except sit there looking like she's thinking, ""Didn't anyone remember to write me some lines?"" Foster plays the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as if he's got dementia. ""I know I put that code book somewhere."" And one actor in the war room, I won't insult him by mentioning his name, so hilariously over acts throughout that you'll be reminded of Johnny from ""Airplane."" I was waiting for someone to ask him what kind of plane was attacking, to which he would reply, ""Oh, it's a big pretty white plane with curtains in the windows and wheels and it looks like a big Tylenol."" Then there's the plot. Really? There's a plot? Something about some evil vaguely North Korean villain from a Bond film and his American traitor pal wanting to punish America for its excesses and Wall Street and, I don't know. What I do know is, apparently, it takes the Marines 15 minutes to get to the White House when it's under siege. ""Hey Brad, do we turn left on K street or Pennsylvania?"" And it's fine for enemy planes to enter our restricted airspace since the $750 billion we spend on defense doesn't, apparently, account for any weapons capable of shooting down a single rogue aircraft.So, with the nation's Marines, Army, Air Force, Secret Service and capital city's police force unable to save us, we turn, as we so often do, to the efforts of a lone, down trodden hero. In this role, Butler saves the movie from completely devolving into a series of WTH moments. But, you half expect him to run into Bruce Willis along the way. ""You go that way, I'll go this way, and I'll meet you at the bad guy's lair."" Butler and Freeman do their best but Freeman looks to be wondering, ""my god, who wrote this tripe?"" Which brings us to the writing. Woody Allen couldn't have done it better, though he tried with ""What's Up Tiger Lily."" The dialog here made about as much sense. During the fight scenes you could almost hear them shouting, ""Saracen pig! Spartan dog! Turkish Taffy."" You do get the usual serving of clichés. Navy Seals approach the White House in helicopters. ""Five minutes. I want a clean deployment."" As opposed to what? The usual haphazard deployment? Then there's some beautiful Monty Python-esque comedic timing. Freeman is warned it's a trap but he won't abort the rescue operation. After five of the six helicopters are destroyed he hollers, ""Abort!"" Um, wait. You couldn't have given that order four helicopters ago? Melissa Leo, a terrific actress, terrifically miscast as a sort of drunken Secretary of Defense, tells the bad guy she'll never give up the codes. The president waits until she's been beaten near to death and then says, ""I order you to give them the codes."" She should have replied, ""Now you say that?? Now?? Next time, how about you order me to give them the codes before they knock my teeth out?"" And, about those codes. Apparently they'll blow up nuclear missiles across America turning our nation into a vast wasteland (small detail, self destructing the missiles would not set off a nuclear explosion). The bad guy is forcing the codes out of the three people he holds hostage. But he's good enough to force them out one every thirty minutes. A bad guy needs to build suspense.So, don't bother to bring your belief with you. You'll be suspending it so much, it's hardly worth the effort. Nothing in this movie approaches reality in any way shape or form. None of it could ever happen. But do bring your comedic improv skills, as hilarious bits will pop into your head from start to finish. Maybe even share some of them with the audience in Rocky Horror-like fashion. As a drama, I'd have rated this a zero. But, as a comedy, it gets a ten and that averages out to 5. It's funny as hell and, we should be grateful that Hollywood has finally turned out a terrific comedy for 2013, unintentional or not.",Olympus Has Fallen

400,xenoraiser,A Time-Killing Action Flick That's More Entertaining to Watch Than it is to Look Back On,6,21 March 2013,"If you're looking for an action film straight out of the 90's but stuck in the present day, you'll arrive at Olympus Has Fallen. We're initially led to believe that this might offer a story of personal redemption, when it's in fact a rudimentary action flick with little purpose beyond entertaining the regular American viewer. There's nothing wrong with offering a film such as this, so long as its entertaining. And, thankfully, Olympus Has Fallen offers enough enjoyable and compelling moments to keep its viewers watching with some degree of interest. No, the characters are not compelling and far from fully developed, and that's not necessarily the point. The point here is to keep the audience entertained and occupied, which is done sufficiently, if in an inconsistently effective manner. Gerard Butler does what he has to, being the fairly routine action hero a la John McClane, which is a bit of a shame since the opening act alludes to so much more. But by the second half, just about all potential for actual exploration is cast aside. Aaron Eckhart is a likable actor in all of his performances, even in one as underplayed as this. There's also a potentially strong predicament foreshadowed early on that could've been utilized to give the film a great edge, but it's ultimately abandoned for the routine action movie wrap-up. Meanwhile, everyone's favorite key player, Morgan Freeman, really seems bored in each scene, as if he's only there to occupy the cameraman's attention.As you can probably guess, both the plot and characters are thin, with only implied potential separating the key players from even more routine movies (which isn't saying much). The action and tension are where Olympus Has Fallen is left to shine, which it does during the time is plays. Looking back, however, it's far easier to pick the movie apart. You'll be entertained while watching it, but left banging your head shortly after leaving the theater.Given the lackluster stream of movies released so far this year, Olympus Has Fallen is able to make enough room for itself. Taken into account with other action films, however, there's little (if anything) to truly make it stand out. There's a sense of identity crisis here, as the film is more or less lost in another time period and suggests more than it delivers.

Aaron Eckhart is appropriate jutty-jawed (well equipped for the role!) and heroic as the US president. Gerard Butler does a pretty good job shouting(and swearing prolifically) in a faintly American accent as a highly clichéd, hardened, ex-special forces secret service dude, and Morgan Freeman delivers his lines with suitable gravitas - that's just about all that can be said in faint praise of this film.The story is ridiculous and the script highly unoriginal and derivative. The film takes itself far too seriously and has none of the redeeming humour found in some of the other films in the genre (eg Die Hard franchise). The supporting cast of extras seem to behave in a manner designed only to boost the body count - highly trained White House security personnel piling out of the main doors and leaving cover to be minced in a hail of evil Korean gunfire while only Gerard Butler has the wit to fire from cover (and is bullet proof anyhow).Another issue I have is actually with the British Board of Film Classification. There is a lot of foul language in this film, purely for effect and a lot of Jackson Pollock-style brain spattering with head-shots. Maybe a little too graphic for a 15 cert, despite the ready availability of immensely violent and gory games and YouTube material out there.",Olympus Has Fallen
406,arodmitton,I wanted to like it...,4,9 November 2013,"I really did! I love Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart. But this movie just wasn't very good.It was filled with clichés that we had seen hundreds of times, the dialogue was unrealistic, and the plot devices were predictable. I am willing to suspend some disbelief when watching a movie, but this one asked too much of me.I imagine the meeting for this movie went like this:Studio head: ""We've got Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman on board for a big budget action movie. We need ideas, go!""Hack writer 1 ""How about Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart dress up as black women to try and infiltrate Morgan Freeman's evil crime ring? We'll call it ""Black Chicks""!""Studio Head: ""Nah, too cerebral. Midwesterners wouldn't get it""Hack writer 2 ""How about terrorists take down the white house and only the disgraced secret service agent can save the day/country?""Studio Head: ""That sounds great! Get me a script in 2 days""Hack writer 2: ""I'll have it done by tomorrow!""Save your money or Netflix queue spot...",Olympus Has Fallen

The action is raw and the plot is tense. There is not a boring movie in this movie. I've given it 10/10.Gerard Butler does a fantastic job as Secret Service agent Mike Banning and so do the other actors in this film. But Butler steals the show completely. The fight sequences are really good too with a lot of martial arts and weapons all over the place. This will keep you glued to your seats wanting to know what happens next.

408,isisinhouston,"Long on action, short on sense",8,25 March 2013,"I like a good action film as well as the next guy/gal and have been looking forward to this one to help get the awful taste of the last Die Hard movie out of my mouth. Being a little over critical of wardrobe and set dressing, I had to just shrug off the low quality dress shirts they put on Aaron and his secret servicemen in the first scene. Okay, I can do that. The suits themselves looked pretty good so you didn't notice the shirts so much once they put their jackets on. You don't get to relax for long before one bad decision after another lands the president, some of his staff and the bad guys in the president's bunker under the White House. I have to admit that the story they created to get to this point was disappointing. When you ignore protocol, you will have problems. That's the main theme here. The rest is high speed action, more bad decisions and only Mike (Gerard Butler, looking real good) can clean up the mess. Took me forever to figure out who Gerard's wife was. Radha Mitchel, aka Johnny Depp's wife in Finding Neverland.There was no fall from grace for Gerard's character so don't let that mislead you. More like, you remind me of my loss and grief so I don't want to see you right now. That's not a fall from grace.There was a scene at the beginning that made me think there was going to be some political whining that reflects too much on the present whine fest in our country and I was glad that didn't last long.Great cast. Even the kid is good. Not on long but not annoying like so many kids are written.There is lots of bloody violence but what would you expect from a radical group taking over the White House? Silly String?",Olympus Has Fallen
409,duckforceone-5-626305,Hollywood has fallen,3,18 August 2013,"Just watched this movie.And i'm stunned at how bad the script and story was. It was filled with plot holes, stuff just didn't make sense in any way.Now i'm a soldier, a tactician and a movie maker. And for each of my professions, this movie rates bad bad bad.All the us soldiers in the movie, were being shown as if they only had the skills of a civilian with no training what so ever. Everything they seemed to do, was stuff a real soldier would not do.The tactics employed by the US response, was against everything they train and practice currently. Even the government, would never take any of those decisions they took in the movie.That just leaves this movie to be so improbably and unlikely, that it totally breaks the enjoyment of watching it.And don't get me started on characters and the way they interacted. A first year movie script student, could write a better script than this. The script is so badly mangled, that they violated most of the good unwritten rules about how to build up a story.On a positive note, picture quality was nice. But not even the greatest actors among the cast, managed to save the bad script.

Gerard Butler at his best, Morgan Freeman always great and so were the rest of the cast. What I would like to point out though is: how believable can this be?? So many people found it such a terrible movie, because... how can this possibly happen to us in the USA?? Come on people, the worst ever acts of terror have happened in the US of A!! I am not saying that the exact replication of this scenario can happen but.. so much else HAS happened, Why do you act so surprised and offended? It can happen is the US or anywhere else in the world as long as there terrorists around no matter where they come from. As far as the movie is concerned, it is a good story well brought to the screen by Antoine Fuqua and of course it's main star Gerard Butler.I am sick and tired of reading about ""anhother Die Hard"" movie. From critics to audiences,if one will say it, then everybody else repeats the same theme. Come on people, find something more original to say otherwise, don't say anything, be creative instead of boring.The movie was anything but boring. And after all, THIS IS A MOVIE.

What makes it even worse, I went to see the new Evil Dead movie which was sold out and thought I would take a chance on Olympus Has Fallen.. You know what is even more painful? I bought an extra ticket by mistake. Man I hated it.Olympus Has Fallen is correct, fallen into my top 10 list of worst movies I have ever seen. It was plain ridiculous.

Going in to the theater with this mindset, I was actually pleased with what I saw. With the premise given, you cannot expect much from a movie like this. You will expect a shoot-em-up with some pretty cool action scenes. Well, that is what you get. None of the characters are very likable, only because you never know too much about them. But something about them just makes you care. The movie really is unrealistic in almost every way, but who would want a realistic movie in this setup? The main character would be dead in seconds...where's the fun there? Acting is pretty good, but nothing really memorable. Overall, I did enjoy this movie. It is definitely intended for older audiences. It reminded me of Taken, but on a larger, more close- quarters, less personal scale.

Cheesy lines, cheesy action, one of the poorest dialogs ever to be put on screen. I mean, do they still make movies like this? You get a guy who does not really care about his family as much as he does about the president and his country, has been fired from the presidential guard, yet has retained access status to the White House coded something, who takes on an entire terrorist group of 40+ people who are unmerciful cold-blooded relentless murderers, and of course North Koreans, the new heathen, now that Russian commies are outdated, and who gets unscathed running within false walls while under fire by automatic weapons, firing back with a pistol and managing to actually kill two guys without looking, and all this while all the time being behind a wall.

416,dragosRO,"Unbelievable.. uh.. sorry, not believable",6,2 July 2013,"I love action movies. Having a desk-job I wanna at least see how it would be like to be a real action-hero. And for that, I give this movie half of the score (5 points). I don't particularly like the way Hollywood has gone these days, from the pre-2000 style of killing thousands of enemies without the heroes getting a single scratch to today's good guys deaths in the hundreds. But still, you have plenty of shooting, decent fight scenes, the length is good, the climax was not interrupted by some bad-guy getting back to life, all well (I think) directed and despite what some say, the CG was more than decent.However, as much as I like action movies this one pushes it. I'm used to having a story that has some non-credible starting point, but on some level it still has to make me believe it could actually happen. Not this one. I find it very, very hard to believe that the seat of power in today's world is so poorly defended, so well known by everyone and so far away from any military outpost. It's just not credible that a team of 50 (albeit well trained) special ops could storm the White House in less than the 15 min it took the army to arrive (also a dubious number). I know it's cinema, I know it's make believe, but still.. make me believe it's not so easy. Also make me believe that the life of one man will not outbalance the lives of millions. Also make me believe that the destruction of a nation does not rest in 3 codes, so secret that everyone knew who had them. That's all I ask from my 2 hours of entertaining. And for that, I only add just one more point.Rest assure, this is not the only time the White House get's burned down this summer (I don't know, do they talk to each-other about the theme of the year?!) and by the looks of it, this is the better one. So enjoy. Oh, by the way, looking at the budget figure I think I know why Freeman and Butler are in this movie and it can't be for the script.",Olympus Has Fallen
417,PhilGuest,Not bad but no DIE HARD,6,15 April 2013,"Washington DC. 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is under siege from heavily-armed North Korean terrorists. President Aaron Eckhart is held prisoner 120 foot below the Oval Office in his fortified bunker. And America's only hope of rescuing him prowls in the shadows of the West Wing - rogue ex-Secret Service agent, Gerard Butler...Yes, it's Die Hard in the White House. Or that's what action thriller Olympus Has Fallen aspires to be. Oh, it really wants to be Die Hard. One small drawback, however - it doesn't have a tenth of the style, wit or intelligence that film possesses. Not to mention that there are plot holes in the Olympus script big enough to fly Air Force One through. And whilst Gerard Butler is a decent enough actor and believable in his (many) fight scenes, he's no Bruce Willis.But it's OK. Olympus holds its own alongside other Die Hard wannabes that are still a fun watch: Under Siege, Sudden Death and - er - Die Hard 2. Olympus also boasts an impressive supporting cast of Oscar winners and nominees - such as Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster - who between them manage to make the ham-fisted dialogue work.Olympus Has Fallen is a decent enough popcorn movie - arguably not worth buying a cinema ticket for but certainly worth catching on DVD. It's also that rare thing these days - a red in tooth-and-claw action thriller. Olympus is no heavily diluted Good Day To Die Hard nonsense. It wears its '15' certificate as a badge of pride, with bloody on screen violence, a sky high body count and the 'F' word used in extremis. The initial attack on the White House - with terrorists strafing the Washington DC streets from their customised Hercules plane - has real impact, particularly in this post-9/11 world. True, there's some horribly shoddy VFX in this sequence but the action is efficiently directed by Antoine Fuqua and compellingly brutal.",Olympus Has Fallen

To get Aaron Echkart, Gerry Butler and Morgan Freeman to star in a turkey like this, you have to be really good at what you do.So I am guessing that they probably spent all their budget on the star studded cast and forgot to budget for other things such as the special effects.

Cast was good. Plot was lacking as expected. Predictable for the most part. Of course they were politically correct and would not blame what happened on any specific nation, but on a 'terrorist' from a specific nation. Would have liked Morgan Freeman (playing Speaker of the House and acting President) to have had more balls and told the terrorists to stick it up their a***s and just invaded North Korea immediately upon the demand to withdraw from the DMZ.The plot was so close to the original Die Hard in some ways, that there were scenes I swear they completely ripped offs from it. The cigarette scene, the helicopters and the roof scene, the hunting down the one rogue unknown good guy hiding element of the plot. Very very much a Die Hard wanna be.There were some relatively direct links to Air Force One as well. The President not following protocol leading to the mess they were in, the super duper secrete bunker to protect the president that our worst enemies not only know of, but know how all its computer systems et al in said bunker work. The family threat element (although that was not dominate like in AF1).Matrix - yea, the whole hiding in the walls thing was a direct rip from the Matrix.....no getting around that.....My recommendation....go see it and enjoy watching a very bad situation where the good guy kicks the s**t out of some bad a***s but don't expect anything original.",Olympus Has Fallen

After a ridiculous plan by terrorists actually appears to be working, you cannot help but root a bit for them, the Americans are so damn stupid they have it coming. The next moment you'll hate the terrorists again because they think it's smart to cut the power in an action movie, effectively making most action scenes occur in darkness. Doh! Curse you terrorists!

The terrorists are attackin the white house , killing everyone in 13 minutes , but only one survives..our hero in roll of Gerrard Buttler who offered nice acting indeed. I like that guy! He is funny yet badass kicker! Nice! So taking down white house is peace of cake for those expert and now they got hostages (president and some other important people)..few of them.

If you like violence and enjoy watching our capitol being disgraced with cynical ease, you probably would like this movie. Me no like. A formidable and deadly high tech North Korean terrorist coup (it's OK to chuckle here) masterminds a plan to take over the white house and kidnap the President and several other top government officials-especially those three that have critical nuclear codes who mysteriously are all in the same place at the same time (isn't there some kind of rule against that?) Homeland security, CIA and FBI are apparently completely unaware that these villains have planned this attack-involving tanks, air power, high tech weapons and dozens of armed men despite probably knowing the size of the underwear I bought the previous week, and are caught completely unprepared. One man, Mike Banning does what easily over a hundred well trained law enforcement personnel could not do: he dodges all the bullets, wins the big fight and takes out the entire coup single handedly. What for? To save the president, of course. The whole idea is that we would give in to terrorists to save basically one man (the president) in a situation like this, at the cost of losing a war while showing the world that we are pushovers.

In the end, Banning has found his way into the bunker where the President is being held against his will by the Korean leader, Kang and rescues him.

So it is with ""Olympus Has Fallen"", Antoine Fuqua's Frankenstein like creation which appears to have been assembled from dead body parts cynically collected from the graves of other, better movies.The comparisons to ""Die Hard"" are as unavoidable as they are embarrassing. Multiple scenes are largely cut and pasted from the gold standard of action adventure flicks to this forgettable piece of detritus. Gerard Butler displays every nuance of his acting ability, covering the gamut from angry to very angry to thoroughly angry. Perhaps for his next role he can do a study in confused and perplexed.At one point, Morgan Freeman actually has to send out for coffee just to keep himself awake through this dreary and interminable exercise.The plot, such as it is, is an utterly predictable and pedestrian exercise in ""let's rip off everyone else's movies and hope no one notices"". The characters are hackneyed cardboard cutouts. The plot twists are telegraphed so far in advance the filmmaker appears to be showing a 'Previously on Olympus' catch up for those who just returned from a 30 minute popcorn sojourn in the lobby.Beyond the novelty of yet another director blowing up Washington, DC, this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it.

Don't get me wrong, the acting isn't bad and the special effects are passable (even by modern standards), but the basic plot is so implausible that the average 10 year would find it an insult to their intelligence.I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't give details, but the movie centers around a terrorist takeover of the the White House and a lone former Secret Service agent defending the building. The premise that a small terrorist organization could take over the most heavily guarded building in the militarily powerful country in the world should give anyone pause. Even given ""suspension of disbelief,"" the way the plot unfolds as well as the terrorist's motivations and tactics are almost comical.Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman and practically everyone else give perfectly fine performances, but the plot is so ridiculous at times it feels like they are overacting.

The plot of this movie is a large group of terrorists decide to take control of the White House, and then Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler, must stop these terrorists before their master plan can succeed.As far as the action goes, it's spectacularly violent and bloodly. You got people being shot up by a C-130 in the sky, people being killed in ways where realistic gore is shown, guys being strangled to death, etc. So yeah it's pretty violent, but a lot of fun to watch.As far as the characters and writing go, the story is basically disposable, but the point of the film is to deliver a fun action flick, not a drama. And the most memorable characters in the film, in my opinion, are Mike Banning, Ben Asher, and the main villain who I can't ever remember the name of. Everyone else isn't as memorable.If you're just up for a good time with lots of gore and action, Olympus Has Falen is the movie for you.",Olympus Has Fallen

There are gaping plot holes but I honestly couldn't care as this action flick delivers on so many levels. The violence is fairly brutal, a refreshing change from the normal pc Hollywood fare, and it was nice to view a movie which clearly has a distinct adult target audience in mind rather than trying to cater to everyone and diluting its impact (think Taken 2 - they could easily have softened the violence and reduced the rating, this would no doubt have increased the viewing figures while while damaging the film - well done for sticking to their vision).This will win no awards, won't be talked about in 20 years and will turn up late at night on terrestrial TV but who cares - this is one very enjoyable movie.",Olympus Has Fallen

However when reality kicks in would you really sacrifice the safety of a nation for one man? Well ""Acting "" President, Morgan Freeman in his now omnipresent role as President/God/Leader of Humanity- (tick the appropriate box) has this decision to make as a terrorist group take over the White House and capture the President in an attempt to get the US to withdraw the 7th Fleet from the Korean Sea, withdraw the US Army from the DMZ in Korea and blow up US IBM's in their silos thus reducing the USA to a wasteland similar to North Korea. And only one man, Mike Banning can stop them which he of course does with great aplomb and pithy humour. An above average film of its genre and I particularly like the put down of the bellicose gung ho General Clegg played wonderfully by the great Robert Forster. There is a great one-liner from Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) to his arch nemesis Kang (Rick Yune) which is ""Lets play the game of F*@k Off....You go first"" All in all great fun and worth seeing .

The scene is worsened by the fact that one minute before the secret service agents were trying to force the president's son to use his seat belt.

The death of his wife, at the start of the film, is to set up the fact that the President, later puts all his friends ahead of not only national security but the fate of the millions of US citizens. The President is captured in the most outrageous way, held captive and all the demands of the terrorists are met. There is no way this happens in real life or even comes close. The command center appeared to receive all its info from news footage is it reels from one disaster to the next. The only surprising part was that the Presidents son actually manages to escape on queue. I do applaud the film for not dragging out the final fight as done in so may other films.

The CGI is pretty amateur (like, ""90's Command and Conquer"" amateur) and the composite shots are quite obviously footage from two different cameras. The acting is passable, though unspectacular, but the casting is fairly curious... Aaron Eckhart is a pretty good actor, but one of the least ""presidential"" people I think I've ever seen in my life. Battle for LA and Thank You For Smoking were perfect for him, but being Presidential just over-matches him. Gerard Butler's American accent is ""ok"" but still laughable in places... However, Yune's portrayal of a psychotic villain--though typecast and telegraphed--is pretty fun to watch.If you pay attention while watching the film, almost none of the plot twists are that shocking... except the one that inexplicably ""doesn't happen"". It's almost like they 2/3 of the way through the film and realized that they needed to drastically change the story to allow the main character a moment of redemption-- but didn't have the attention span to make it work with the rest of the script, so they just kind of left it as was. **Spoiler Alert** It's in with the Cerberus codes... they just ignored the part about getting the last piece out of the President.Beyond the off-balanced quirks and shoddy cinematography, the only real complaint to make is that it is fairly generic.

What I don't get is Aaron Eckhart agreeing to act in it. OK, I can understand that he wanted to have 'President' as one of his acting attributes, but now he can add Turkey as another. Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler I do understand. They have both been known to choose some cheesy rolesonly this time the opted for a mature Stilton. So, now we choose the North Koreans as bad guys. Guess we must be running out of enemies to portray. The only thing missing was a kick-boxing, machine gun toting Kim Il-Sung (though this would have probably improved the average quality of the movie). To sum up - Acting was bad (with the slight exception of Finley Jacobsen), writing was incomprehensibly bad, prejudices were high and the audience was robbed blindly.

Like the stereotypical terrorists who try to fake their own deaths at the end...just to name one. But seriously, it was like watching a rip of Die Hard without John McClane.

I'm pretty confident that Antoine Fuqua is a Die Hard fan and he thought that he could have fun with his 70M budget. First mistake was to make Gerald Butler the lead. Half Tough Guy, half Romcom Ninja. This guy is boring and have near to no charisma. The closest he actually got from being cool was in Rock'n'rolla but yet, he was out-shined by Hardy, Kebbel and Strong. So the Banning character is not much credible during the whole movie. Second mistake the whole plot. You have such a hard time trying to accept it that in the end, you just don't. That pretty much ruined the experience for me. I won't go into the details so I don't spoil it for you. But you don't see how the leaders of one of the most powerful country in the world could act like they do. Third and final mistake. Too much gratuitous violence. Sure it's an action movie and there's terrorists involved. But some of this violence did not felt right at all, even in the context. While a few scenes where necessary because it showed how those terrorists meant business and were to be taken seriously. Some other scenes really felt like they only been shot to create a shock value. Those sometimes even felt sadistic to me. Which had no point being in that kind of movie. However the movie is not that bad (hence the 4 stars) it's really action packed with only a few downtime. While there's nothing breath taking or really creative with the action, it's decent. And if this genre of movie is your favourite you might even end up enjoying it. In the end if you're not a movie buff or an action fan you pretty much want to avoid this film.

We have big and slow unidentified military aircraft coming over ocean, taking down two modern fighter aircraft, reaching Washington and wreaking havoc. We have only 2 SAM missiles in Washington, and they are incapable of destroying this ancient turboprop cargo plane. Nobody on White House roof have stinger or something like it, of course.

Nobody in the white house apparently had any military, or police training, they are spewing from inside on the lawn with no regard for their own life and completely oblivious to cover of any kind. Of course, none of them is issued life west, or any long barreled weapon... Those defense cuts are real bitch...And what stupid plot... Secret service lets bunch of private security guys in WH bunker. They turned out to be the bad guys, take hostage president. That makes him incapable of being president. I didn't catch where is vice president, but he also is incapacitated, so there is possibility he is also in bunker. Way to go secret service...

As one official put it ""if we can self destruct them, there is possibility our enemy could do it"". That's why only test missiles have that option.

And yeah its pretty much Die Hard meets Air Force One but who cares its all about the excitement, seeing whats going to happen next. The only downside I had was that it was a little too obvious who the traitor was in the movie (I mean come on isn't he always a bad guy). Overall I give the movie a solid 10 out of 10. It's exactly what an action movie should be, it gives you the jumps, the thrills, a hero to root for and a villain you love to hate. If you think a movie like this isn't for you I suggest you watch a Twilight movie, it doesn't have Gerard Butler killing terrorists....but it does have a sissy that sparkles.",Olympus Has Fallen
463,uptowndcsoulja-638-634479,"Gerard Butler in Olympus Has Fallen reminds me a lot of Bruce Willis in the movie ""Die Hard,""",6,16 April 2013,"The movie preview of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" made me want to watch it. Especially when I saw the action sequences in My City Washington, D.C. our Nation's Capitol – the scenes were definitely memorable. Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors – he played Mike Banning in this movie. Gerard Butler in Olympus Has Fallen reminds me a lot of Bruce Willis in the movie ""Die Hard,"" where Bruce is trapped in the same building as the villains and has to find a way of defeating them from within. The North Korean terrorist/villain Kang was played perfectly by Rick Yune. The cinematography is great and the supporting actors played their parts well. The fight scenes and shooting scenes were realistic and the choreography was done very precise.The down side about this film generally deals with the supporting actors' lines – it was over dramatic at times and it made you feel as if you could have wrote better lines for them yourself. The action scenes in the beginning were not enough – it left you expecting more from the enormous military plane than what it did in this film. Seasoned actors like Morgan Freeman and Angel Bassett were virtually nonexistent in this film – their roles should have had more involvement, with more dramatic lines. Olympus Has Fallen was basically Gerard Butler versus Rick Yune in a future real life foretelling of an impending war between the United States and North Korea.I give ""Olympus Has Fallen"" 6 out of 10 Stars",Olympus Has Fallen

Then the Speaker (acting President) Morgan Freeman caves to the demands of the terrorists and withdraws troops from Korea knowing it will lead to war. All of this was not believable and dumb. All he needed to do was storm the White House with military troops and take it back. Pretty simple. Maybe the President would have died, but he was giving up security codes anyway. Instead, in order to advance this horrible plot, Freeman proclaims it is all up to Butler to save the world. So dumb. The Koreans took the White House inn13 minutes.

But Let's face it, if the only three people in the world with the detonation codes for every single nuclear missile were all being held hostage by a terrorist in the White House bunker -- which just happened to be the only place in the world where the detonation codes could be changed -- well, I feel pretty confident the order would be given to storm the White House and kill everyone in it ... including the President. And if the cops and the Navy SEALS couldn't handle this task, I feel pretty sure every one of us gun toting rednecks would swarm on the White House and demolish it to the ground in about 15 minutes.And speaking of stupid, how about that super dooper gun turret they somehow miraculously smuggled into the White House and strategically placed on the roof such that it could shoot down 6 Navy SEAL helicopters??? OMFG! STOOOPID! This movie was Die Hard on steroids. Lame lame lame lame lame, and again, lame. Of course they cap the whole thing off with the proverbial ticking time bomb at the end ... that our hero just manages to deactivate at the last second, saving us all from certain doom.What has the American population become that they would try to pass off an utterly inane and stupid piece of malarkey like this movie on us as an even marginally plausible scenario for a terrorist attack ... never-mind having only one goober inside able to thwart the attack ... and we as Americans don't stand up en masse and demand our freakin' money back for this garbage??

No movie fan, no matter what age, should go without seeing it. However, this is the closest thing we are going to get to another movie like the original Die Hard. Both movies share many similar characteristics, only the stakes are much larger in Olympus Has Fallen.In Die Hard, the only thing was a lot of money was going to be taken. This time, not only is the President's life at stake, but it evolves into a much more high-risk situation.Olympus Has Fallen shows great acting in it's talent. Veteran Morgan Freeman brings a performance as strong as the rest of his. Along with that, Aaron Eckhart brings his ""A"" game, much like The Dark Knight. Last, but certainly not least, Gerard Butler delivers the best performance of his career.Olympus Has Fallen delivers the sense of awe that i have not experienced in a while. The entire White House attack scene will leave you with an open jaw, watered eyes, and a sense of despair.

479,neba91,Exceptionally bad movie.,4,3 August 2013,"I never write reviews. It's time consuming, and everyone's opinion is different. But I had to write one for this movie. Of course I didn't expect much, but I expected a movie I wouldn't walk out on. I didn't do it just because I think you can't judge a movie if you haven't seen it from the start 'till the end, but that was my only motive to stay and see it through. I figured Morgan Freeman wouldn't accept a role if the movie was bad. I think they fooled him and everyone else pretty well. This movie could sound totally acceptable in short, but the final product looked like it was made in a rush by a team of people who have some other, much bigger projects that they will enjoy completing more... Special effects are AWFUL. The blood, the explosions - they HURT. I haven't seen a movie with such obvious CGI since 1998, probably. Plot - the idea is not bad, but the realization... My GOD. Dialogues are incredibly one-dimensional, the whole nation thinks the president is dead, and none other than our great Mike Bening figures that there's something off with the fact that the terrorist demand a chopper to escape,but then decide (when everything goes according to plan) to blow themselves up. Also, are you telling me that there's a person so dumb to believe that it's possible to just storm the White House WITH A BOMBER PLANE which would, by the way, have been spotted thousands of miles off the coast of USA, especially on a day of the big meeting of the two highest positioned politicians of two countries? Then there are these ""patriotized"" moments where, in real life, a person would beg for its life, call for their mom, ANYTHING except repeating an oath to a flag/your country/your people. Main characters are a group of people from a fairy tale, which would be acceptable if they played a roll of a medieval knight, for example, not the roles of politicians whose profession has, you have to agree, not much with honor.I could go on forever, I always expect bad and good from the film, I am rarely shocked with a movie, be it great or awful, but this one left me in a state of disbelief...

The moralising is fantastically simple (American capitalism = good; Anyone who criticises America = evil).

482,kcalbertina59,"Great Action, Solid Cast, But Somewhat Flunks the Plausibilibity Test",7,28 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen has a lot to like about it, but there are too many times that I was asking myself ""Why would he do that?"" or ""Why would he think that?"" or ""How could that happen"". There were just a few too many moments that didn't make any sense.The action is intense and nearly non-stop after the opening 15-20 minutes of the film. Although there were many predictable moments, the film also has its share of twists to keep it interesting. I will say that I made one of the villains early on, although I'm not so sure it wasn't a lucky guess rather than a flaw in the film.Gerard Butler is a likable and capable lead in this action film. As others have stated, his Mike Banning character can certainly draw comparisons to Bruce Willis' John McClane character from the Die Hard movies, and deservedly so. Like McClane, Butler's Banning fights as virtually a one-man army against the bad guys and has good one-liners that make him ever the more fun.Aaron Eckhart is also enjoyable as President Asher, a character that tries to be nearly as tough as Banning. Morgan Freeman and Angela Bassett give their usual strong supporting roles, as does Melissa Leo in a small, but noticeable role as the Secretary of Defense. Rick Yune was solid as Kang, the main villain. For an action movie, the acting was much better than the norm overall.Where I believe the movie does fall apart is the plot/storyline. The main plot was a little weak, although I could buy into that. After all, this is an action flick, so one generally has to suspend disbelief. But about every 5 or 10 minutes in this film, somebody does something that just didn't make any sense if one has any logic at all. Throughout most of the movie, Banning seems to be not only the great action hero, but the only character that has any sense at all. Brains + brawn with good dialog makes for a great action hero, but couldn't someone else use their brain occasionally.Don't get me wrong, it was a fun movie that will keep you entertained for a couple of hours, just don't expect it to be the perfect movie. On the action, characters, and acting alone, I could have given this an 8 or so, but with the holes in the plot/storyline, it unfortunately drops to the 6.5-7 range, which in many ways is kind of a shame.

Do I start with how the antagonists all have magic bullets and the secret service agents don't or that the good guys are too stupid to seek cover when being fired upon. Maybe I should start with the plane that decimates DC and how it wasn't even questioned on the radio till it was flying over DC. Or maybe how Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is giving information to Speaker Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) and says that were forty terrorists and now they are down to twenty-eight. Seriously, I think Banning killed over six so out of all the other agents they killed the other half.My biggest angst is that Kang (Rick Yune) is torturing people for some codes and the President (Aaron Eckhart) keeps saying ""Give him the code he will never get mine."" and when it finally comes to the point in the movie where Kang needs his code it is ALREADY in the computer. What happened? How did Kang get his code? Also, the fact that they gave into the terrorist demands over the life of the President is hysterical especially when they bring up the phrase ""We do not negotiate with terrorists."".Overall, I thought this movie should have been renamed a comedy because I have never laughed so hard at all the ridiculous inaccuracies and weak story line.",Olympus Has Fallen

The editing made things look pretty good and the variety of killing styles used was appreciated. It gets boring if everyone just uses guns. A good head grab and twist is always well received. The main problem with this movie was how predictable it was. Don't get me wrong, there were a few times where I gripped Joe's hand harder in suspense (yep, saw it with my wonderful boyfriend), but you already knew how it would end as soon as it started.

Die Hard is responsible for many action film clichés but what made Die Hard special for me at least, was the reluctant hero who is out of his depth but pushes and quips his way to victory.The writing is is hammy, despite the pretty cool premise the film is marred by a seemingly inept good guys who manage to some how let a huge plane fly right over the most important building in the US. This is then followed by highly trained special agents running into the line of fire and government officials making continually bad decisions.Poor film.",Olympus Has Fallen

Namely, begin to pull American land forces out of the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea, and the move the American 7th Fleet away from Korean waters. So basically the entire United States Government and military caved, except for Secret Service Agent Gerald Butler. The movie lost its steam when the United States ended up looking weak.

Yes those things (cams) are everywhere too. Darn...even in our cars. What's with this ten lines of text BS? My goodness... can I write a bit on a movie without the curse of ""it's not long enough crap"" going on? I say old chaps it's enough said.

502,ystump-1,Olympus Has Fallen aka Die Hard in the White House,7,27 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen is a mostly formulaic action movie that hit the right spot for me. It's not entirely original but it is entertaining, which is more than I can say for every other action flick that has come out this year. This is the script they should've slapped the Die Hard name to instead of that garbage that was the newest Die Hard. In fact, this is the best Die Hard since the third one. It follows the simple formula; lone hero in a confined space, vastly out-manned and out gunned, ton of kills and the occasional one liner. Olympus has Fallen does all of these things exceedingly better than any action-er I've seen this year.Before I get too ahead of myself, should probably let you know what this flick is about. Olympus Has Fallen is about disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning who finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to attempt to rescue the President from his North Korean kidnappers. The story is not the most original but moves at a good pace and is not too complicated. What makes this movie stand apart from the others is the hugely talented cast. Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Robert Forster, Melissa Leo, Ashley Judd, Dylan McDermott, Cole Hauser, Radha Mitchell & Rick Yune. Told ya the cast was huge. Everyone is very capable in their roles but due to the size it seems a few people are underused (Melissa Leo and Angela Bassett especially). I'm a huge fan of Gerard Butler's when he's in action flicks (QUIT DOING ROMANTIC COMEDIES), he's very likable and physical enough to make the action believable. Aaron Eckhart plays the President, and is awesome as usual but it does feel like he slips into Harvey Dent mode a few times. Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman, you know what to expect with him.The actions scenes are extremely well done, the CG looks a little video gameish at points but it's OK. A ton of stuff gets blown up, the body count is huge and there are some surprisingly brutal deaths. As far as the action goes, it gets an A+. Antoine Fuqua directed this movie and does a decent job. He creates an incredible sense of tension, which is a rarity for these type of movies. Like I said, the action is well done but it seems like Mr. Fuqua watched a few too many Michael Bay movies. The slow motion is overused, the color schemes are similar, the music is hokey and final scene (which involves an American flag) looks like it was lifted from every Bay film. As you can tell, I'm not a fan of Bay's and these things are about the only negatives I have.Olympus Has Fallen is the best action movie of 2013, so far. It was a ton of fun to watch, had some very good tension and was simply a really fun watch. If you're a fan of action movies, this is a definite watch.",Olympus Has Fallen

But you have to suspend disbelief to an enormous extent to enjoy the movie. I am not going to list all of the places where this falls apart. But basically, the movie is completely predicated on the fact that the terrorists gain access to the safe room in the white house because the POTUS overrides standard protocol so that he can take his visiting dignitary (and that dignitary's entire security team) with him to the safe room. Now, how did the terrorists decide that was going to happen and plan around it? And don't even get me started on the portrayal of Cerberus as a completely hare-brained idea that would destroy the US if it was ever used (as portrayed in this movie, if there is an accidental launch of an ICBM, the US would be better off letting it get to its target because if they try to destroy it using Cerberus, every other American ICBM automatically gets armed and detonates in its silo, thus destroying the US several times over). It is like Independence Day, but with fewer special effects and more martial arts.",Olympus Has Fallen
505,chrismartin181-1,A surprisingly good time,8,25 April 2013,"Olympus has fallen, or as I like to call it the semi-big action blockbuster that comes out between Oblivion and Iron Man 3. To my surprise it's actually rather good.The story in a nutshell is the White House gets taken over by North Korean terrorists who take the president hostage. It's up to Gerard Butler who plays John McClane from Die Hard to save him and indeed the United States of 'Murica.I mention Die Hard there and I'm afraid I'm about to mention it again in a way that will probably upset a lot of people. Feel free to disagree but, brace yourself:I think Olympus Has Fallen is better than Die Hard.Still reading? Thanks for giving me a chance- so many people are in love with Die Hard and to be honest that's just what this movie is. But in my honest opinion it's done better. I understand it's over 20 years old but this is exactly the film that needs to reboot the Die Hard formula, not the pretty abysmal Die Hard 5.The scenes where the White House is taken down initially are possibly the most striking in the film. There's a hella lotta explosions and people are mowed down here there and everywhere. It's a scene put there to make Americans angry and give them someone to hate instantly. It probably does the job well, I can imagine them grumbling 'damn foreigners' under their breath as they see the Washington Monument crumble to the ground.The rest of the film is usually a tense affair that almost always ends in John McCla...I mean Gerard Butler's character in a nicely choreographed throw down with a bunch of North Koreans. The plot isn't overly complex and that's exactly how I feel it should be. It's a story of good guy goes after bad guy to save America and that's all it needs to be.The film does have it's flaws however. The aforementioned simplistic story does leave a few plot holes that didn't bother me to much but did my fellow movie goers. 'Why didn't they just do this' 'They said that was impossible earlier on then did it easily later' were the general things I heard so it's probably best to not think too hard about it as you watch it. Just enjoy the pretty explosions and helicopter crashes and cheer on the USA as they try and bring down the bad guys.There's also some of the most cringe-worthy acting between the president and his son at the start of the movie. The son is hardly even that important in the overall film like it's expected he will be. It would have probably been better to leave the president's son and emotional family back story out completely but I suppose they needed to show the the president as a human being with something to fight for. It makes it a little more interesting than just an emotionless hostage.This is the action film of the year so far, bettering GI Joe and fully eclipsing Die Hard 5 from memory. If you go into the cinema with the mindset of a strong patriotic American citizen you'll have a really good time here.",Olympus Has Fallen
506,sandroalgra,We've all seen this movie before haven't we?,5,6 June 2013,"Well I'm not sure whether you could call this review a spoiler. After all, I think we all knew what was going to happen.Let's see, It's about an underdeveloped villain and criminal mastermind who wants to make America suffer like they made him & his country people suffer and confidently thinks he can take down the most powerful nation of the world by plotting a direct assault that destroys several flags & monuments that symbolize American freedom and kidnapping a tough president who would rather die than negotiate with terrorists though his only weakness is that he cares for his colleagues and family who have all been taken hostage by the army of offensively portrayed foreign terrorists who apparently outclass an entire group of well-trained security guards but are still taken out one by one by a rugged patriotic soldier who doesn't seem to impress the terrorists despite his achievements and taunting one-liners and who according to a skeptic high military official cannot be trusted because he failed his job years before which also means the hero now has a chance to redeem himself by saving the president who then proceeds to give an inspiring ""USA! USA!"" speech that celebrates the fact that the country's system failed miserably and had to be saved by one man who remains extremely discrete about it and wants nothing but to return to his wife to make up for a previously missed date.*Spoilers end here* Yup, I've seen this film before. All in all I think this movie was done better than most other flicks of the same genre. It doesn't reach the Independence Day level of cheesiness. That still doesn't take away the fact that the story was one big cliché. It had entertainment value though.6/10",Olympus Has Fallen
507,robert-cogan,Warmongering and incredible,1,29 March 2013,"I hoped from the previews to see an exciting action flick with spectacular scenes, suspense, maybe some cleverness, heroism and victory in the end. Hyper violent, anti-North Korean war mongering overwhelmed any such values. North Korean ""terrorists"" are shown as brutal and ruthless as Nazis. American air defense is incredibly skimpy, incompetent and late. Our military leaders are weak saps who cave in to every terrorist demand with ""Oh, Pleeze don't hurt our President! We'll do what you want."" Our control of our own most potent weapons systems is easily overridden by one woman terrorist at a keyboard. The American SuperDuperHero single-handedly kills many of the terrorists and liberates the President. After killing the UberVillain, he even has a moment to put a bandage on the wounded President. That scene actually made me laugh.My wife and I regret we paid to see this. Negative emotions stirred up by the film may cause bad effects, mental, such as tolerance for another preemptive war, and bodily, like raised blood pressure, heart rate, stomach acid. With tripe like this, if you liked the wars against Viet Nam, Serbia, and Iraq, you'll probably love our wars on Iran and ""Second Korea.""",Olympus Has Fallen

510,jonathanhovda,I got dumber by watching this movie,1,29 June 2013,"I concur with others that stated in their review they wanted to stab a pencil through their ear to pull out the part of their brain holding any memory of this horrible, awful movie.Yes, huge plot holes are very evident, but given the director and screenwriters backgrounds, I am not surprised. You have to suspend logic while you watch this. How exactly would a C-130 fly from North Korea to the US east coast? What countries do they have basing rights with, and what sort of air bridge is set up to facilitate fueling this plane for that long of a trip? How exactly did over 100 North Korean Nationals make it to the US without rousing suspicion. How exactly did they get all of the weapons (including the huge gun on the top of the white house)? It became evident as soon as the SecDef walked out the front door that no, the front door is not booby trapped. So, she walks out, and they don't send any special forces in at that point??? They figure they will let the star handle everything, no need for assistance? Another thing, once the gun on the roof was taken out, why not send your troops in through the roof again? The threat is gone, and there was at least one H-60 that had ropes that survived the attack.It seemed the bad guys kept multiplying as the movie went on. At the start of the movie, there were about 20 or 30 bad guys on the lawn, and half of them were taken out, but throughout the movie, we saw WAY more than that in the actual white house.As others have stated, the phony nationalism is just ridiculous. So the ""double-agent"" speaks out about wall street, are we to think wall street is now ""good"". Do we forget how they destroyed the housing market? Are we THAT stupid? How is it that 80% of the reviews are 5 star or below, but the overall rating is 6.7 (as of today)? Unfortunately, the folks clicking on the 7, 8, 9 or 10 stars on the IMDb page for this movie validate Hollywood's perception of dumb theater audiences. Even though the vast majority of critics called this a pile of garbage, if folks are paying to see this, and validating this horrible movie with a high rating, the terrible directors and producers will continue to pump out this non-sense.",Olympus Has Fallen

So, I only want to point out one more thing:How can a serious movie, obviously with the intention to support patriotism, show a POTUS who is treating his own people with such contempt that he willingly risks the lives of millions just to save a politician and a high ranking military member some pain and suffering?But the worst of this all is the fact that this president was afterward almost treated like a hero and example for a strong nation. Did nobody realize what he did before? This president should have been charged with treason and breach of secrecy. He voluntarily delivered information to the enemy that was really concerning the national security. Snowdon was a harmless kid against this president.So, what's this movie supposed to teach? That a flag and an individual are ""the nation"" to protect, and not its people? That a president is so far above the law that he can and should protect his fellow politicians over his people?This is not ridiculous as many commentators felt.

There's no way to suspend disbelief when it just rips at the viewer's normal common sense. The first part that's ridiculous is all the secret service agents rushing the White House lawn firing their little 9mm's randomly at 50 cal. machine gun barrage and vastly superior numbers of guns/assailants. Lots of secret service agents have military, if not special forces, training. These trained professionals would have acted with far more calculation. It doesn't take much brains to figure out you're gonna die needlessly if you run out into the clear into massive superior weaponry. WWI mentality in a 21st century movie = dumb movie. (It made sense in WWI since machine guns had never been used in a major conflict before then). There's no way this would happen in reality, and indeed, brains were all, graphically, turning to pink mist. The split with the remotely reasonable goes on and on from there. It's not worth my time to recap all the stupidity.What's most disappointing is, I can see how this idea could have been carefully constructed and turned into a truly great movie. Instead, I guess they just went for the fast $15 million profit above the film's budget. I'd imagine, with these actors, they could have more than tripled that and maintained artistic integrity with a more believable plot. It's just a big ""shoot 'em up"".

Many have been saying that it's a fun ride if you ""leave your brain at the door"". Quite what movie these critics have been watching is beyond me.OLYMPUS IS FALLEN is dumb certainly, oh lord yes, but far worse it is an utterly joyless, turgid movie. Don't let pages and pages of banal ""comic relief"" dialogue fool you into thinking this is a movie which doesn't want to be taken seriously. Butler's heroics are about as plausible as those of the most far out superhero, but it's hard to cheer on his actions in a film which perversely contextualises him in a dour plot routed in real life geopolitical issues, and loaded with naturalistic depictions of death and suffering. Antoine Fuqua fills this film with the same kind of cloying, manipulative imagery he used for the preachy TEARS OF THE SUN a decade ago; the camera pans mournfully over grey-lit corpses, and burnt American flags are carelessly thrown off the roof by Korean terrorists while we wait for the next unexciting action scene to get underway.Fuqua made his debut fifteen years ago with forgettable American Yun-Fat Chow vehicle THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, and if anything his skills with action have severely lessened in the interim. There's not a moment of suspense or excitement here, every set piece resolutely unambitious; perhaps just as well for a film where the screen is frequently too dark for anything to be seen. While the editing is far from the worst from a recent action film, a number of disorientating cuts serve to lower the film one more notch.OLYMPUS IS FALLEN is the worst kind of DIE HARD clone; one that makes you wonder if A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD wasn't so bad after all.",Olympus Has Fallen

That being said having Butler work with someone like Fuqua, he's able show that he can be that brawny action guy with a heart. I heard several people complain that the movie is implausible, well, so was 9/11 and it happened. My problem is why are people even thinking about North Korean terrorist attacking the White House, it's a movie, it's fiction. That being said, I would be lying if I didn't have flashbacks of seeing the news on 9/ll. Olympus has fallen has a lot of blood, deaths, assassinations, and several action movie clichés. It also shows the different relationship the main characters have to one another. Aaron Eckhart does a good job as a Kennedyesque president. Ashley Judd's appearance was too brief to criticize.

To its credit the action never stopped. The actors would not have known what to do if they weren't killing or being killed. The Koreans were disposable, had no personalities so when they were killed in equally horribile ways you could not feel sorry for them because you did not know who they were. I think this movie is principally a piece of propaganda to tell the viewing public how truly awful the North Koreans are so if the US invade any day now, don't you go feeling sorry for them. Why else would they have worn masks indoors. Faceless robots do not get the audience sympathy.",Olympus Has Fallen
526,joeymaley,Die Hard - White House Style,8,2 October 2013,"Olympus has fallen - The Joey Review.Ever since Gerard Butler showed his action hero stance in 300, people have clambered to see him in any 'fighty fight, shooty shooty, explosion style' flick. He does well in these films, and Olympus has Fallen is no exception. Olympus has Fallen (or as it shall hence-forth be known - 'Die Hard In The White House') is exactly what you expect, as we have seen this set up so many times before: Our hero is a broken man due to a life altering incident but when the baddies come a knocking he has to step up and kick some arse. Die Hard in the White House is a good film as it doesn't pretend that it is anything it is not. It knows that people come to see this film for any of the following 3 reasons: 1, Action film - big badda boom. 2, Gerard Butler - Calm down ladies. 3, Morgan Freeman's voice - Need i say more?Die Hard in the White House is slightly better than most films from this genre as it doesn't fall into too many of the same old cliché action potholes. Butler's role is not that of a broken man who just wants to drink himself into an early grave due to the previously mentioned trauma (See Arnie's classic 'End of Days), nor does it dull down the plot points for it's audience (to much).All in all i would give this an 8 out of 10. Butler was good (he even managed to pull of a Boston style accent) and he does kick some serious arse. Arron Eckhart does his usual top notch acting and the Prez of the good ol' US of A. Morgan Freeman says words, thus making it a hit. (As we know, anything with him in it is amazing.)Next on Joey's watch list is the doppelganger to 'Die Hard In The White House' - 'White House Down', Or as it shall be now known 'That film with Jamie Foxx and that buff dude that is just like Olypus Has Fallen.'Joey says 'Watch this film, or don't. I'm not the boss of you.'",Olympus Has Fallen

You know what? That's why we call this movie fiction. Just buckle up and enjoy the ride.Most of the negative reviews I read here are more a reflection of the disappointing trend toward crowdstorming by the antifa types in an attempt to discredit anything seen as American patriotic. Apparently, Howard Zinn has been successful in teaching generations of Americans his version of historic lies.This is not the best action movie out there. But, it's not bad.

533,george-kakaletris,This Olympus Never Existed!!!,1,9 April 2013,"The reason we've not had another 9/11 twelve years later, is because the government doesn't work, think or react as these Idiotic Hollywood caricatures in Olympus. Banning as a ""disgraced"" Secret Service Agent? He did the right & proper thing for the people & government of the US, saving the President. A no-brainer. However, after seeing how the President acts & thinks throughout this movie, Banning should have let the President die & saved his wife. He is chosen by the People of the US to lead his country, when the time comes for his life to be saved, he takes it personally that Banning acts in the interest of the US & not in the interest of the President's personal feelings. Strike 1. When the SS informs the President of a breach in Airspace, he orders to bring the Koreans to the Bunker. He's informed that his request is against protocol, he orders to bring them anyway. By doing so, he initiates the takeover of the WH & the Potential destruction of the US, South Korea & hundreds of millions of lives. There's a reason why protocols are set in place. Strike 2. The Terrorist needs 3 secure codes to realize his plan & threatens to kill the very people who have them in order to get the codes (Think of that for a second; only 3 people have the codes & he threatens to kill them to get the codes. OK, so I don't give you the code and you kill me, now what? Game over) so The President of the US, who sends hundreds of thousands of soldiers into battle & in harm's way to protect Americans, is here unwilling to let one die to save hundreds of millions. Strike 3. You are out Mr.President and so is this movie.Suppose these Moral, Technical & Ridiculous plot holes are missed by us. How do you explain the following ridiculous acts? 1. An Unregistered C-130 entering air restricted space gets intercepted only after arriving over D.C. proper. That would never happen, especially after 9/11. Get Real Hollywood. 2. Elite trained SS agents don't know how to take cover, but rather run into a hail of bullets. Understandable if they're jumping in front of the President (As McCarthy did with Reagan in 81) but these guys were involved in a firefight. This was probably the best way to rid the good guys so Banning could take over. Kids who play video games know how to react better than these agents. 3. The acting President & most of his staff, would rather allow millions of South Koreans to die, nuclear war erupt; possibility of losing some kind of implausible control over ICBMs that leaves the US defenseless & millions of people to potentially die, in order to protect one man, as though the President is the U.S.A. 4. Banning is gone from the SS for 18 months, yet the codes are still operable by him in the WH. The most protected office in the world has security codes that still have the same codes after 18 months & can be accessed by a former SS agent. A ""disgraced"" agent. One would think he may be disgruntled and thus any accessible information by him would be retracted. Guess not. 5. If the potential danger existed with the security codes, why would you not, as the president of the US, allow the death of one or two people in order to save Millions? Especially if you knew that by killing the first person with the ""codes"" there's no way of the danger being realized. By the way, ICBM missiles first have to be armed, before they can be disarmed, all that those three codes would do is cause minor explosions within the Silos. 6. Before any foreign World leader visits the WH, their entire security staff would be screened & re-screened & disarmed before entering the WH. But if they followed those procedures it would make for a very short movie. 7. The son is integral to securing the code from the president. The Terrorist sends out men to die in order to find the kid, only to find out it was not necessary, he had the president's code the whole time. I also respectfully disagree with the comparison to Die-hard. True, it is one guy saving everyone, but this copies the first Under Siege, almost scene by scene. For instance: a. Terrorist(Jones/Yune) are taking over Whitehouse/Battleship.(WH/BS) b.Terrorists gain control by being invited to the WH/BS by government officials. c. Terrorists get assistance to takeover the WH/BS by a trader(Busey/ McDermott) who works for the WH/BS.d. ""Disgraced"" elite agents Seagal/Butler working a less than glorious job, are in the right place at the right time to save the WH/BS. e. Both S/B are helped & monitored by a staff/government officials from a smart-room.f. Both S/B become the eyes & ears for the smart-room. g. Both S/B have special devices to communicate with the smart-room at all points h. Both S/B have to stop the bad guys from launching a nuclear hell. i. Both S/B are questioned by a high-ranking official in the smart room if they can be trusted. j. Both S/B are defended by someone in the smart-room & reassured by that official that S/B are trustworthy based on personal interaction & past missions. k. Both S/B have antagonists in the smart room who hatch plots using SEALs that go awry. l. Both S/B prove the antagonists in the smart room wrong time & time again.Final question, how did the Terrorists know the Presidents Code? If we had the director in front of a Senate Judiciary Committee to answer for this plot-hole, I'm sure his reply would be: ""I do not recollect Senator""",Olympus Has Fallen

I really had my hopes up for this one but they were immediately shattered.The only reason I gave this as many stars as I did was because the action scenes kept my interest and there were a whole bunch of explosions.Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you need something to be playing in the background or you have a coupon or a free rental that needs to be used.",Olympus Has Fallen

The acting was great but the storyline was awful.They lost me in the first 10 minutes,the first part where the lady dies was to bad. But then an airplane reaches the capital so easily and takes out 2 fighters (that positions hem selves as easy targets) I lost faith in the movie.To me this movie is about how weak the Americans are. They rather save the life of 1 person that save millions. Is that the message they want to send to the world?

""U.S.A doesn't negotiate with terrorists"" protocol, is one of the most most famous movie quote in most of action movies, and it is true in real life, this movie changed this protocol into ""U.S.A doesn't negotiate with terrorists unless they've captured the president, then please give them what they want, give them all the nuclear weapons codes, move the U.S army for them, help North Korea invade South Korea"" protocol.The writers of this movie clearly haven't watch The West Wing T.V Show, and for sure they didn't even take the time to learn about some basic secret service protocol, for example, it is well known to any political action movie fan, that when there is a potential danger on the white house, the secret service take the president, the vice president, the security council, the chef commander of joint forces to different locations, but in this movie, not only they locked them in the same place, they let the south Korea's prime minister and his whole security team to be locked with them in the bunker beneath the white house. How stupid is that ? And apparently no one in the whole U.S administration knows anything about anything, and according to this movie, they army, FBI, NSA, and the Secret Service don't have any protocol for this situation.

I'm sorry, but when you have the president joking whilst seeing so much death and distraction around him saying 'its ok the house is insured' was just horrible and in very bad taste, that and the clapping and complete happiness in the control room in the pentagon when the president was saved, even after so much death and destruction made me realise how stupid the writers can be.

If you like action and are not too bothered about a realistic plot, then you will love this film. It has some great scenes and, to be honest, I enjoyed the majority of it.

The plot is basically insane. The bad guy is threatening to kill the hostages if the US doesn't withdraw their forces from South Korea but it's OK that an ex ranger roams free in the building. There's no drama, only violence. The cheap CGI makes the movie visually dull. The Cerberus (Mass Effect much?) thing as a plot twist is again idiotic.

Lacklustre performances, a plot that a 6 year old could write, patriotism oozing from every frame, fight scenes we have seen a billion times before. No Antoine, this has to be your darkest hour yet. I honestly expected far far better. This is the first movie I have ever given a 2 star rating to. Gerard Butler, if he hadn't been given such a poor character to work with might have stolen the show but honestly, nothing could have saved this shallow plot beside Aaron Eckhart becoming an alien.

However, after reading a few of of these ""1-star"" reviews, I asked myself, just how much fun did I actually have watching it ? A lot. The action scenes are brutal, thrilling and completely unapologetic by nature of their portrayal, which leaves you shocked breathless at times. There's no romance/love story to divulge to, the film doesn't shy away from attacking the viewer with more extreme violence and it does so beautifully. The result ? Well, it definitely had me glued to the edge of my seat and my mouth open throughout the watch. This is the reason I can forgive its many drawbacks that would strangle many other films in the genre.

His presence contributed something. It was a shame that his character, however, did not.The villain was cool. The gun fights were cool. The hand-to-hand combat was PATHETIC. It all amounted to close up shots of the waist, artfully avoiding the need for choreography. Most combat was resolved with a ""Sock!"" punch of some kind. It was so dated, it was like watching a fight scene in the original Star Trek series, only without the surrounding plot or character interaction.So, cool guns, cool explosions, and some watchable stock characters.Here we get to the best part of the movie. It was hilarious. I'm sure people in the audience thought the big American accent guy at the front of the cinema must have found all the flag waving (at an obvious point that everyone knew was coming, just to avoid spoilers) quite evocative, because I literally had to bite my fingers until the pain was overwhelming to avoid bursting into laughter.

I was surprised to see Dylan McDermott (whom I had seen in American Horror Story) in the film. As I am not a fan of R-rated movies in particular, the violence at times was a bit graphic for me, but a lot of the time I felt was handled well with angles and cutting.

The trailer was quite promising which made me to go for the movie and I am glad to inform that I have no regrets watching this movie. It is one of the movies that would remind you of some of the other action flicks that you might have watched previously yet at the end it successfully makes its mark. However, despite the good performances by the lead characters such as Morgan Freeman, Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart; I could not help it but wish the latter had more things to do apart from being helpless in most of the scenes as his character was underplayed in my views. The plot is predictable though at most at least however I must admit the director was smart in packaging a-not-so-new-plot with a better delivery tactics. It comes with the blends of action, sense of patriotism, sentiments and just the right amount of humor. A good movie to spend your money on!",Olympus Has Fallen

Perhaps go Darker? More serious? Nope! Olympus has Fallen goes down another avenue, and literally uses every cliché in modern cinema, back to back, repeatedly, both visually and in dialog. Never have so many American flags been burnt/ shot through/ thrown off buildings all to the sounds of that classic haunting lone trumpet player.Olympus has Fallen revels in it ludicrous script, astonishing body count and potty plot, but comes out somehow feeling like a classic and dare I say it, refreshing. If you missed the 80's American Blockbuster, your wait is over, it appears its alive and well.

Lets start with the accident scene. I'm assuming that was a big tree branch that fell on the hood of the lead vehicle. (unless there are torsos falling freely from the sky, in which case they have amazing accuracy to hit the suv just perfectly.)And I don't know of too many bridges that high above the ground that far in that have trees high enough to drop a big heavy branch on a vehicle like that. So the car spins out of control, and amazingly the ONLY seat belt to amazingly be stuck is the presidents wife's seat belt. Then there is the undamaged door that won't open. And I agree with others on here about the reaction by US military. Maybe it was tea time and they just couldn't make it in time to save the white house and save the president. and talk about a turkey shoot. Just where did the SS learn how to be cannon fodder anyway?

Especially if you are American, the slow motion unfurling flags, lengthy speeches of integrity, honour (sorry honor) and God blessing of America, would have you beating your chest in a patriotic fervour. I can count on two fingers the amount of American films that have some sort of governmental aspect that don't rely on these stereotypical and hackneyed wishy washy film flam features. Why oh why do these producers think that a slow motion ""Old Glory"" will have the masses flock to cinemas and inspire Oscar nominations? This COULD HAVE BEEN a good film if it didn't rely on patriotic claptrap, taking aside that Gerard Butler isn't even American, and his performance was at best mediocre, the plot was full of holes and contrivances. If you did away with Cerebrus (what a ridiculous concept), did away with ""I pledge allegiance to the American flag and the constitution"", did away with the son who so EASILY escaped, and instead had a RUTHLESS protagonist, a BELIEVABLE goal ( I mean, withdrawing the fleet, yeah that was dramatic... not!) and some ways of foiling security that were halfway reasonable then yep, the film would have been OK. I mean, a load of diplomats simply walk into the White House, FULLY ARMED without being checked AT ALL ?? How silly. At best this film was a distraction, its no wonder it didn't do so well at the box office. It reminded me of the 1982 film ""Who dares wins"" about the Iranian Embassy in London. That film was 31 years ago, and even though very dated, was far more credible than OHF. Im not anti American or anything, but it really riles me that film makers rely so heavily on American patriotism, don't they realise that their market is only about 20% USA, please give the rest of the world a little credit without trying to instil in us your patriotic propaganda...

Much like the ""Die Hard"" series it has a one-man-army who saves the day singlehandedly who is portrayed by Gerard Butler. But unlike the Die Hard franchise he is not the wrong person at the wrong place; rather he is the right person for the job. The action set pieces, tight direction and talk-less-fight-more-esque cinematography are like any one of those moderate-budgeted action movies. So action-lovers will be delighted and will surely enjoy the film. Gerard Butler was convincing in his part (well he is the 300 guy; so why wont he?). But casting Aaron Eckhart as the American President is a little questionable but its purely my personal opinion. He tried to be convincing but something was lacking; maybe because when Morgan Freeman was on-board who would've wanted Eckhart as the president. But no worry it hasn't affected the entertainment quotient of the movie. The film will provide enough adrenaline rush for its targeted action-film-lovers.",Olympus Has Fallen

No spoilers there, it kinda referred to in the title, the trailer. ""Olympus has fallen"" is kind of a metaphor/code word for The White house being taken by the enemy, I guess, where the Prez is Zeus. Gerard Butler's character is Perseus. The depth of moronity of the decisions made by the most high ranking officials astounds me, so, sadly, that's why I couldn't take it too seriously. I get that it furthers the plots and adds tension. But in a real life scenario similar to the story, if leaders acted like that, they deserve to be overthrown. I did like Gerard Butler's trademark brutality, probably the only redeeming aspect of the film. It felt like I was watching a Call of Duty late game mission, made into a film with a copy/paste of the '88 Die Hard plot. If you liked Die Hard and not thinking too hard about how a normal person would behave, as opposed to these characters who act as though plot progression is the motivator rather than sound reason and rational judgement.

Fabrizio Quattrochi was an Italian security guard who was taken hostage and shot in Iraq in 2004. Just before he was killed, he shouted, ""Now I'll show you how an Italian dies.""

I couldn't decide whether to laugh or be angry.In the event of the capture of the President, nobody would negotiate with these terrorists as long as the chain of command is still in tact. The fact that the President himself expressed this (which could be interpreted as a direct order) before he was gagged makes this even more ridiculous. North Korea does not even have the technological resources to mount such an attack and occupation. In reality, we would immediately level North Korea to a smoldering pile. Also, does the Korean government not believe in background checks? They just let 5 mercenaries accompany the prime minister straight to the US President.It took 15 minutes for the Army to arrive when there is a AC130 mowing down civilians, really?

I can suspend belief that a C-130 gunship could violate restricted airspace and cause havoc in Washington D.C.

Great marketing by the Independence Day director and his team!What Antoine Fuqua does well here is direct this similar to how he did with Bait with Jaime Foxx and the Denzel movie Training Day, he takes a mediocre script and crafts an adrenaline filled ride from start to finish and for that you have to give him credit. Gerard Butler as Mike Banning as a disgraced secret service agent in an action hero role is certainly likable but he's not Bruce Willis as he's wooden at best not as much fun as King Leonidas in 300 but way better than in his prior roles as The Bounty Hunter and that's the first of many problems. I do like the casting of Rick Yune who (as Zao the villain in the Diamond themed Die Another Day) does a convincing job as a North Korean terrorist bent on taking control of the White House and our Nuclear Weapons arsenal in a typical revenge because the mean Americans killed his mommy plot.Great casting of Morgan Freeman as Speaker of the House and Angela Bassett as Secret Service Chief and perfection in regards to Robert Forester as Chief of Staff General Clegg one of the coolest actors around. Yet no one in their right mind should have made Dylan McDermott a secret service agent. He fights like a sissy and he looks like one too. Big mistake. Clunk.As to the film, preposterous events transpire from start to finish especially the fact that there's no ""Here we come to save the day"" attempt at rescue by anyone after the exciting car crash at the beginning of the film. Then the North Koreans go virtually unchallenged in their B2 bomber all the way up the Chesapeake Bay and then they are able to get their hands on and then have time to set up a top secret multi-ton ballistic weapon on a hydraulic lift in the White House in a very short time frame. Also, why a secret service agent no longer on White House detail has the current codes to access a safe in the Oval Office is bizarre at best. From what I have read the script was cobbled together in March 2012 which in movie production time is seconds thus the reason for the numerous plot holes so big you could assume control of the White House and our entire nuclear weapon arsenal controlled by a stupid Cerberus system that puts it in the hands of three alphanumeric codes. This film makes you proud to be an American (sarcasm) that we could get away with making movies like this.... At least it was extremely exciting so if you can suspend believe its going to be a great hour and a half of action, outrageous bloodshed and some decent special effects. The problem is that its so easy to catch 40 of these type of movie on NetFlix so why did I shell out my $10 for this one?",Olympus Has Fallen

598,custom-10-849317,awesome beautiful movie,10,22 March 2013,"this movie is a masterpiece and a work of art. the action just keeps coming and the plot is believable. this has become my favorite movie of all time.the characters come to life. I must warn you all, however, that there are extreme images of violence against women. however, if you are a fan of explosions, shooting,and hard core fight scenes, then this movie with an all star cast is for you. I give this movie 10 stars out of ten rating, because it deserves it. it could possibly be the best movie of the year, or even the decade. the protagonist, Gerard Butler, shines in his best role yet.some of the parts were predictable, but to have a movie about America falling to terrorists in American markets, without a bit of hero action predictability, would more than likely not bet met with such enthusiasm in America. then again you always want to see the hero win over the bad guy. Gerard Butler does this with class and style. you get the good guy with the bad attitude approach. he even tells off the acting president.(spoiler alert!)***I was sad to see Ashley Judd die so early on in the film. Aaron Eckhart too is in his best role yet. Morgan Freeman was a huge let down, but the rest of the stars carried him nicely. I was very disappointed with Mr. Freeman's performance.watching the American flag fall and the white house explode was the best part for me. It was so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes of happiness. the antagonist of the film was superb. he was ruthless and calculating. the special effects are top notch and it looked so real.all in all this film is a true must see masterpiece. it has it's moments of downfall, as any film will, but they recover nicely from these faults and the action packed plot keeps you engaged.",Olympus Has Fallen

I say they use patriotism in the cheapest manner because they used it falsely. This was not a movie about American perseverance or strength, it was a cheap action movie in which one man takes down a force that was mighty enough to overtake the White House. Let me repeat that to make it explicitly clear, one man takes down a force mighty enough to take the White house. This movie was not about America or the world.

601,ghostriderstrobl,Olympus Fell Hard,3,25 July 2013,"First off, let me start this review by saying that I love action movies. Die Hard, Conan, Tango & Cash, etc. I figured that Olympus Has Fallen would fall in line as one of the stupid but fun action movies that I love. It got the stupid part, but missed the fun. This film was faaaaar to serious to be an action movie. To the people who compare it to Die Hard I say this: You obviously hate Die Hard. This movie had only TWO brief scenes where I felt like it could be Die Hard. When Banning is talking to Kang on the radio and when Banning tortures those two people. That's it.I'm not going to talk a lot about the acting because it was good. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. Instead, I am going to talk about this movie's impressively bad script. I will probably talk about these scenes out of order, so forgive me. First, I would like to talk about the movie's tone. This movie was way too serious. What should have been a lighthearted action movie full of one-liners was turned into War & Peace. This made the movie's poor decisions unforgivable.First, let's talk about the assault on the White House scene. We have some ground assailants as well as two people in trucks with turrets. Instead of sending out a man with an RPG or even a machine gun, the security team decides to send out groups of twenty armed with only handguns. After about the fifth go-round of this, we have one person, who gets shot immediately after, say, ""F---! I thought that would work!"" It obviously was not smart to send out waves of men with handguns. I like to imagine that there was a general or someone with authority yelling, ""More handguns!""Now I would like to talk about when the North Koreans invade the White House. They take the American Flag and throw it on the ground, so the viewer knows that America is in trouble. At the end, the flag is hoisted back up, so you know it's all good. This just felt sort of stupid to me. Again, if this movie had had a lighter tone, this would have been fine, but with the movie taking itself seriously, I had to ask myself why these scenes were necessary.Now I want to talk about the scene where the terrorists torture Ruth to get the code. They beat her up and after three hits she is bleeding everywhere and is throwing up. The president then says, ""Don't worry, Ruthie. Go ahead and tell them. That's an order. They won't get my code."" And Ruthie tells them the code and then thanks the president. What Ruthie does not do is say, ""Thanks for telling me that before they beat me almost to death, Mr. President."" That was what I was thinking. Then the writers have Ruth say, ""If I die, I want it on my gravestone that I didn't go down without a fight."" Actually, Ruth, you just did! You gave them your code after being kicked three or four times. Quite a battle to the finish, madame.Finally, I am going to talk about this movie's theme of redemption. It starts out with Banning saving the president instead of the first lady. The president demotes him or something so that he won't be reminded of the time his wife died. At the end of the movie, Banning is promoted back to his old position. Because it's okay for him to remind the president of the day thousands died.If you're still not convinced that this is horrible, I don't know what else to say to you. Just don't see this movie. It will throw away two hours of your life. I will say this one more time. The tone of the movie is the main problem. A lighter tone and this could have been good. I will give this a three because the acting was fair. But if you really want to see a movie about the White House, go see White House Down.",Olympus Has Fallen
602,ZaruM22,Cold War II?,3,23 April 2013,"In a nutshell: drivel.This film was passably entertaining as a 'watch it once' action thriller, but only if you can ignore the ludicrous patriotism and propaganda that swamps the film, nearly from start to finish. Where to begin? The CGI though in the end better than it appears in the trailers, is still substandard for any film produced this side of 2000. The violence was literally out of a video game and clearly made to appeal to that audience, even going as far as to have one of the characters playing such at the beginning of the movie as if to set the standard. The acting was below par, and the film was a colossal waste of the talents of such as Morgan Freeman. The plot is absurd. An insult to the intelligence, it was so implausible. And no-one in authority would handle the situation in the way they did in the film. The ending was predictable. Olympus came across not just as an anti-North Korean propaganda movie, but as some absurd revival of the 'yellow-peril', threat of the East nonsense, saturated with superficial patriotism. There is no point waving a flag and spewing out meaningless words if you don't believe in or even know about what the United States was or is supposed to be about, and what it is supposed to stand for. It shouldn't take someone from Britain of all places to point that out! But this is how the film conveys its representation of the USA - of flags, and no foundation. It reminded me of some of the 'cold war' films churned out into the 1980s, with stereotype 'Ruskies' and other cringing nonsense, including this over-the-top, lip-service patriotism. And as for trying to smear anti-wall street protesters and related people as terrorists and traitors - give me a break! If anyone can be included among the 'heirs' to the 'founding fathers' of the United States, it's people protesting for what is right, for the proverbial freedoms, democracy and of those evermore tarnished but worthy concepts. Not self serving Wall St types (and remember, it's these sorts of people who often fund movies)! And it's not an issue of capitalism versus socialism, but fighting for real freedoms, for what is right, for 'good government' and such forth. I know some people will simply swallow some of the trashy concepts presented in this film without question, and it angers me. Either watch for your own assessment of it's failings, or save your money and see a more worthwhile film. Practically anything may be a better choice than this.",Olympus Has Fallen
603,victor-lengquist,Good action throughout as logic goes down the drain,3,23 August 2013,"The movie is off to a good albeit cheesy start with some decent acting as we are befriending the presidential family. Soon the director try to make us side with the first family and the special agent who fail to protect them, by putting us all through a tragic traffic accident on the way to a re-election fund raiser. Already here the movie is somewhat lacking in quality. One of the cars in the presidential motorcade have its wind shield smashed. How? We're never actually shown. Falling tree trunk maybe. But from where did that come on that seemingly open road. And why does that ruined wind shield lead to an experienced secret service driver loosing control of the car so completely.Towards the latter third of the movie the whole plot seem to suffer a full breakdown of logics. Why oh why, would the American acting president and his staff risk the strategic goals of the USA by withdrawing the seventh fleet from the pacific ocean and American troops from the DMZ on the Korean peninsula? To save the president we're told. Come on! Why risk millions of lives for one person. On top of that, commandos holding the president are close to gaining access to codes which will give them some control of all nuclear missiles belonging to the USA. That if nothing else, surely make the captive president and all his staff expendable. Or so you might think.To top it off, the president is actually shot in the gut close to the end of the movie. However that does not stop him from walking out through the white house doors by his own device (albeit leaning on our hero for support). To be clear. Someone shot in the belly does not walk.

The way I feel is the film set out an extremely complicated issue but when they try to think of a cool solution, they fail. So as things go on, you find what appeared to be unsolvable become easier until the hero can actually solve it. :| The evil force looked strong on the records but showed ton of obvious flaws when facing the main character.

The photo looks exactly the same as the Korean that they've not only invited into the Whitehouse, but also welcomed into the secure bunker with all the US leaders.2. Cerberus was created to allow destruction of deployed US nuclear warheads (for some reason), but nobody thought to ensure you couldn't activate it while the warheads where still on US soil.3.

Also what a terrible way of showing character dimension in a propaganda film. Speaking of propaganda, way to promote the increase for the defense budget, I was surprised not see John McCain's name in the production bill. Great idea to push such strong values of violence, perfectionism, and emotions are weak, down young kids throats.I would hope audiences are smarter than to accept this, but reading reviews apparently people applauded during kill scenes. There was absolutely no consequence for the acts of violence taken place, except that if you are the bad guy you die. Great message... not. This movie is drek. If you want to watch a terrible propaganda film and laugh go with Battleship.

607,sam-burf,Alright. Not worth the watch though.,4,28 August 2013,"It wasn't terrible, it was actually bearable. The only reason I rates this film so poorly is the rubbish backing music which was constantly being played, the rather low quality special effects, how unrealistic the points that the story are based upon are and the quite mediocre camera work. When the terrorist plane is being fired at with missiles for example, the plane looks completely unrealistic and the anti air defence missile explosions leave a lot to be desired. On top of that you've got this ridiculous 'emotion filled' orchestra music in the background, which would actually be a lot more effective if it was just silent. Now to the story plot points, I find it extremely unrealistic to base a story (post 9/11) on a large unresponsive military aircraft being able to get within a couple of miles of the White House without being shot down. Of course you've got the low quality special effects to demonstrate this happening, and the music to really drum the point home. However, what really tops the quality of this particular point of the story, is the constantly fast changing camera shots. To me, this was what really indicated that this film was rather cheap and 'built for action' rather than effect. You can't fault any of the actors, even though they may appear to be C-Grade, you really must blame it upon the director and the edit of the film. Not worth a watch if you like a proper story and the need to think, but this films for you if you enjoy seemingly low budget films with un comprehendible plot points.",Olympus Has Fallen
608,connor_marshall06,Some good action scenes and clever ideas. However lacked a good story line and ending.,6,13 August 2013,"When this movie first came out at the cinemas, many of my friends requested that i wen't and seen it with them. Months later i can say i am glad i waited to rent this one. Before i launch in to the negatives i will state that this film did hold some positives. I found the ruthlessness of the leader Khan to be very intimidating to watch as he showed no mercy in executing the hostages, to often in movies these days terrorists bluff with killing there hostages and it becomes repetitive. Secondly the tactics used in capturing the white house were clever and kept you guessing throughout the build up of 'how are they going to get past that obstacle?'. What i did not like about this movie was the loop holes and the questions that were to often displayed. Yes it is a movie and being unable to breach the white house would defeat the object of the movie but i just felt that the ease and lack of prevention when it was done was to unrealistic. I also thought the time it took for Banning to attempt to rescue the president was dragged out to much. Also the betrayal from the other agent was quite stupid in my opinion as the whole become good when you are dying scenario just didn't quite do it for me. Overall this had some great action scenes and moments of worry for the on screen hero as you'd question 'how will he escape this one?'

609,astall35,Possibly the Worst Action Flick Ever,1,2 September 2014,"I enjoy action movies, and I am willing to suspend my disbelief and overlook some minor plot holes or inconsistencies to enjoy a movie. I love movies like Air Force One, Total Recall, Commando, Lockout, 300. This movie pushes things so far into the realm of disbelief that it's insulting to the audience. It was even more disappointing than normal considering the cast, which boasts some pretty good actors (a Cole Hauser sighting!). The opening is promising, minus the awful CGI snow, and sets up the rest of the story nicely. From there it all turns to crap. The White House is attacked by one C-130 with two pilots that somehow makes it into Washington DC before being intercepted by two (two!) jets which it promptly shreds with some self-aiming mini-guns while avoiding missiles fired at it from the White House. It then takes another five minutes or so for the US to scramble one (one!) more jet to take out the plane while it kills 2/3 of the population of metro DC. Meanwhile suicide bombers take out the fence, groups of Korean terrorists start pulling machine guns out of kimchi carts and assaulting the White House while groups of Secret Service agents rush directly into the bullets. Then security forces for a South Korean guy go rogue, spring into action and take everyone in the President's bunker hostage. The Koreans shouldn't even be in the bunker, but the President insists! So this whole plan hinges on being in the same bunker with the President, which is only possible because the President himself forced it to happen (against protocol of course!). Then lots of other stupid things happen and our hero saves the day. I'll spare summarizing the rest of the movie and point out some seriously stupid stuff instead in no particular order:No reasoning is ever given for McDermott's character turning against America. Or his sudden conversion back.How do the Koreans know about Cerberus? How did they get that Hydra thing?If Cerberus is a failsafe then why would it cause the missiles to go nuclear? Wouldn't it simply disarm the missile? This makes no sense. Also if it's a failsafe why is there a 5 minute countdown? Wouldn't it need to be instantaneous to be effective?Where was the Korean guy going to go with the President? They had started a 5 minute countdown to Armageddon, had no vehicle waiting, and if the President was dead (as everyone should have thought) there was no reason to not send in the military to re-take the White House. So why did he leave the bunker? What was the point?Let's land six SEAL teams on the roof of the White House at the same time. What could possibly go wrong? Also make sure all the helicopters fly in one formation in a direct path.So hero saves President, who gets gut-shot in the process. At the end there is some patriotic press conference where hero still has scabs from the cuts on his face. The President though has miraculously recovered from being shot. In the gut. And not receiving medical attention for ~20- 30 minutes. Because after rescuing the President and shutting down the Armageddon device nobody, not one person bothers to go get the President. Our hero has to half-carry him all the way back to the front door of the White House. You know, the guy so important we risked the entire world just for him.",Olympus Has Fallen

A ton of violence (sometimes too much), ridiculous action hero stuff (the main character shoots every single person in the head) and ultimately the bad guy failing simply because he is the bad guy.By no means is it a great movie or even something I would probably ever watch again, but in comparison to a lot of the crap movies being released you could do worse.",Olympus Has Fallen

Otherwise, main casts are solid and good amount of spectacular action scenes keep the pace going till the end.

The Director successfully bring a 2-hours suspense action movie,the plot is good, the acts is good, the strong character of Gerard Butler really makes the difference here. The R rated is much for the violence scene, although this is not to violence if you compare it to The Raid: Redemption, but still this is not really great scene for kids.the only critic for this movie is graphical effect.. for me is quite disappointing for a top-class movie like this. you will see when a plane crashing down in the middle of the town - and exclusively - white house, the cars and traffic are just flowing normally as if nothing happens.. the using of animation is also not very smooth. as conclusion, this movie is still worth to watch, enjoy the action, enjoy the story.",Olympus Has Fallen

Yes, the plot lacks originality and it better make up for it in its treatment. They have really worked hard on action sequences but the edits have failed many scenes. For the whole movie, you don't feel that the protagonist is shattered or to be defeated or even weak. It was really difficult to get in synch with the feelings of the central character.(Its very easy for US audience to relate with 'US is under attack' or 'the world is going to end' kind of plots). Script has got some holes which can quickly kill the flow of watching. The movie is good but not at all great. deserves 5 or 6. Hollywood has much much better to offer than this.",Olympus Has Fallen

However after some thinking, I realized that this movie is truly bizarre. The director and story writers did whatever they pleased to show some mindless action. But there are much better movies for that like die hard (this movie seems in fact an attempt to be Die Hard), mission impossible and James Bond movies which at least create those settings where one can still indulge in the action.I think the intent in this movie was to say that the entire US military and homeland security is a big failure run by an incompetent management throughout and there is only one savior to the White House who is a banished member of President's security team. Maybe I went to the movie with high hopes. Toning them to the rock bottom might help.PS: Ordinarily I would have given the movie 4 stars, but have deducted one star for wasting the talent of Morgan Freeman",Olympus Has Fallen
622,ethschulze,A popcorn movie,7,20 April 2013,"While the concept that the white house could be overtaken in 13 minutes is ridiculous, this is still a pretty decent movie. The acting is about what you would expect from an action movie, however, it has Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart to put it a bit above average. The action scenes are pretty good, though they don't really stand out. The story is predictable like most action movies. The thing the thing that made this movie a seven out of ten for me was the one-liners.Whoever was in charge of writing the one liners did a phenomenal job. They are few and far between but when they happen they are a refreshing breath of comedy in a movie that otherwise takes itself almost too seriously.Overall, a very stereotypical action movie that has an unimpressive story and a ridiculous concept. It is somewhat redeemed by its funny one-liners and decent action scenes. If you are considering seeing it, it isn't bad but is by no means innovative.",Olympus Has Fallen

It's makes you wonder where's the CIA and special agents that suppose to be guarding at the front line of the protection, especially at the white house. Yeah,the White House got surprise attack wherein one of their presidential visitor are the enemy. But are they that dumb to invite them in that bunker with all that secrecy going around with whoever visitor they got, they would just extend their invitation there. There is no Intelligent group neither depicted. probably the government did cost cutting somehow in this story. It is not an Action Hero kind of movie nor a sci-fi.

624,usagiarwen,This is a poor imitation of Die Hard,1,12 May 2013,"There are spoilers here, so reader beware. Normally I don't do movie reviews, but this one was so terrible that I couldn't keep it to myself.Basically you have this movie that tries too hard to meet the standards of the Die Hard franchise but falls flat on its face. First of all, what was the point of listing Ashley Judd in this movie if she's going to die within the first 5-10 minutes? She was one of the reasons I even agreed to go to this film with my mother. The movie could have been a little shorter with it just starting out as the president being a widower. Or hey, they could have ditched Melissa Leo (because the lines she was given were awful, and of course her acting could not have been better than what she was given). They could have replaced her with Ashley Judd and do a little romance on the side. But they didn't even do that with the movie.Then, the movie didn't even have great one liners. (Bruce Willis: Yippy-ki-yay mother ******). No, it falls short of that. But I think the most disappointing part of the movie is that it all seemed like a cookie cut out of Die Hard, where there's all this action that is frantic. The president says they don't negotiate with terrorists, all the while he's telling the other two people to give Kang the Cerberus codes claiming they'll never get his. Then, while they're giving up their codes, the terrorists are banking on him not giving up his, so they have this master code breaker program all prepped and ready to hack the final code they need.Now let's start on Gerard Butler. You'd think that after he lost his job with the death of the president's wife, all his old access codes would no longer work. WRONG. Supposedly everyone forgot about his codes and the potential for a serious security breach and relied on trust that he wouldn't come in the office some day. So, working at the treasury, he also forgets he no longer works there and busts in unaccounted for. He gets into all his old haunts with the codes everyone forgot about - except for him. I call bull. So you have him pulling Bruce Willis's character, even the part where Forbes comes out and tries to share a smoke with him. Ring a bell with Alan Rickman coming out, putting on an American accent and playing buddy buddy with Willis? Only difference here is Forbes isn't exactly the mastermind like Hans Gruber was.The whole idea of getting to the president's kid, and then Butler getting ""sparkplug"" out of there was ridiculous too. Why bother with the kid when Kang's got this master code breaker program? Last but not least - Kang states in the movie that it took only 13 minutes to overtake the white house. Bull. Real agents and army protecting it would not have been so stupid as to pour out of the entrance like ants and let their butts be riddled with bullets by these guys. There would be strategies, contingency plans....if it would have been this easy for terrorists to overtake the white house, then it would have been done in real life years ago. This ""perfect"" plan has so many plot holes in it that it could only ever work on screen with the secret service having blanks for bullets. There was no real story plot, or at least none that satisfied my mind for a reason to break into the most protected property in the USA.The whole thing was boring, and the only reason my mother and I were laughing in the theater was because of the people 2 rows down, crunching on their corn like cows at a grain feeder, and the people behind us so wrapped up in it they were gasping and snickering at the awful one liners.",Olympus Has Fallen

Because the movie is a huge sloppy kiss for the propaganda of this bs ""war on terror"" foisted on the world by the American administration and complicit partners.You just can't get past it - propaganda everywhere. Calling the White House ""Olympus""? Please. No gods there. Dylan Mac's character blithering about why he's turned on his country - intentionally clumsy and harebrained. U.S. flag shot full of holes fluttering down onto the White House lawn, symbolizing what - unprovoked desecration? Ad nauseam.Even the numbers being reported on the movie's performance are suspect. Grossing under $100 million is very believable; that it was made for $70 million (implying its not losing money) not so believable. Nothing with action and special effects gets made for that little.

628,djtindellauthor,Not quite as nuanced as some might like it to be.,5,26 August 2013,"Yes, there were some things wrong with this movie. The two jets that intercept the NK Spectre gunship aren't in proper formation; one should be above and behind the suspect aircraft while the other closes in for visual ID. Yes, it might not be realistic for lightly-armed Secret Servicemen to shoot it out on the White House lawn with the invading terrorists, rather than retreating into the building and barricading themselves inside. And yes, the general should have recalled the Black Hawks bringing in the SEALs after seeing that the Hydra weapons were deployed.And overall, is it realistic to expect the NKs to be capable of launching this kind of attack? Maybe not. But then again, about 12 years ago nobody would've believed it possible that some clowns living in the mountains of Afghanistan could possibly take down the two most prominent buildings in New York City, not to mention strike the Pentagon. Finally, as to those who have posted reviews saying how ashamed they were to be witnessing such blatant pro-American gung-ho patriotism on the screen and in the theater, I can understand how you must feel. Nobody in the movie had a nuanced approach to the problem. Nobody stopped to ask the terrorists what their grievances might be.

It's a shame because I'm a Morgan Freeman fan and I like Gerard Butler - but this movie was horribly hysterical. It had true potential, started out great and I thought it would've been taken in a whole other (non-bs) way. The premise of the story made no sense - that everyone would choose to save the president instead of the rest of the world? The president actually encourages the others to give up their nuc codes to the terrorists? Way funny. I mean, truthfully, if you want a good laugh then this might do the trick! Save for less than a handful of scenes this could've played like an action spoof movie. The action was good, I mean I have to be convinced the only reason Butler took the role was so he could shoot a bunch of things.

But this time, it's Gerard Butler playing Secret Service agent Mike Banning doing the action (and doing a pretty good job of it) instead of Steven Seagal playing Chief Petty Officer Casey Ryback. At times, it's almost the same word for word, but there are more plot twists in Olympus Has Fallen than in Under Siege. There were a couple of places where the script didn't make sense with what the bad guys wanted though, and because of the similarity of the two movies, it was somewhat predictable although Under Siege was on water and Olympus Has Fallen is on land.

Going into the movie I thought it might be fun and I could ignore a few mistakes here and there. But every single event that went on made no sense whatsoever. I was baffled this film received funding to be made. A low flying unresponsive C-130(configured as a cargo plane) makes it into DC airspace and magically shoots down two F22's with side mounted machine guns. These magical machine guns fire and wipe out all police and White House defenses for about 5 minutes. Not only did it have seemingly unlimited ammunition but it had perfect aim hitting even snipers on rooftops. That is just the start of this pathetic film. They referred to the poorly done CGI gun on the roof as a super weapon and it looked like it was drafted from a child's drawing. I could have wasted a whole afternoon describing this terrible film but I have wasted enough time trying to finish watching it. I just can't finish it. As soon as I finished watching a horribly contrived argument between Morgan Freeman and Robert Forster(that didn't even make any sense) I decided I couldn't go on. That is after giving it a free pass on computer systems that looked like silly flash games and military personnel being depicted as complete idiots that run into direct machine gun fire for a small portion of the film. It was obvious that not only did the director not consult military personnel for accuracy in what they use today, he didn't have a grasp of what the United States does in emergency situations.

This film is not for everyone as it is extremely violent, but the non-stop action is a relief from such ""action"" films as Skyfall or Mission Impossible: GP. Olympus is a simple movie that gets a little silly at some parts but it gives people like me what that want: dudes kicking the crap out of each other for America! In all seriousness the movie will make you cringe a bit at all the patriotism, Aaron Eckhart and Melissa Leo's characters say and do some really embarrassing things in the film, and you can tell Morgan Freeman is dialing it in. Other than Butler, the only actor to really shine is Rick Yune as Kang, the leader of the terrorist who attacked the white house.

646,mnhvf,Seagal Clone,8,8 April 2013,"Another reviewer has noted that Olympus Has Fallen shares similarities with the Bruce Willis' Die Hard series & that is so. Olympus also borrows heavily from plot lines & action sequences which we have previously seen in Steven Seagal movies: --a lone hard-ass with tech skills (Seagal in Under Siege & Under Siege Dark Passage) facing an elite band of baddies led by an arch-villain (Tommy Lee Jones in Under Siege); --an attack by a highly trained force of good guys in helicopters is anticipated & thwarted by the wizardry & fire-power of the evil-doers (Under Siege); --missile codes are forcibly extracted from 2 people, under the mistaken belief that no harm will come from the disclosure (Under Siege Dark Passage); --the hostile take-over is facilitated by a dastardly man on the inside (Gary Busey in Under Siege); & --our hero & his antagonist fight to the death, ending with a knife to the latter's head (Under Siege; or in the case of Out for Justice, a cork-screw does the job). Olympus is a well-done action flick. However, I was not keen on the portrayal of the US President, in that he came off, presumably unintentionally, as a wimp: --he instructed his underlings to give up codes to Kang (although we don't negotiate with terrorists) & --he asked after his son 1 or 2 times too often (we get the point: he loves Connor).",Olympus Has Fallen
647,markfishman76,Yippie Ka-Yay Mr. President,8,24 March 2013,"Olympus Has Fallen:  A movie review by a big, bald, film loving Jew. I was highly anticipating this modern take on the throw-back, thrill ride, lone-hero-saves- the-day, action flicks of the 80's & 90's. The simplest way to describe it is ""Die Hard at the White House"", but it is much more than that.In a post 9-11 world, the idea of terrorists attacking the USA, government and its leaders is all the more plausible and therefor more realistic as a film-goer. It adds a sense of ""this could happen"" while enjoying the story and action before you. The film is very well directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Shooter) and the man knows how to pace story, drama and action extremely well.The plot revolves around Secret Service Agent Mike Banning. After being removed from the President's detail following the accidental death of the First Lady, Banning is now the last hope when Terrorists attack the White House and hold key political figures hostage as well as Banning's old pal the President. Banning is portrayed by the incorrigible and lovable (especially by my wife) Gerard Butler. This is one of my favourite performances by Butler, think more Law Abiding Citizen than PS I Love You. Butler delivers on all fronts; cracking wise (a la John McClane) with the terrorist leader and he's more than capable of taking each ""baddie"" out one by one. I especially enjoyed his big brother-esque relationship with the President's son.Other notable performances would include the always amazing Morgan Freeman playing Speaker of the House Trumbull, whose thrust into the roll of acting President and has to make the tough decisions as the leader of the free world is being held captive.  Aaron Eckhart (Dark Knight) as President Asher, had heart and compassion both for his fellow captives and his country and it came across very well. Ashley Judd was beautiful and perfect as the First Lady. Although her performance is brief it was captivating nonetheless.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the exciting and moving Score by composer Trevor Morris. It reminded me of the great action, dramatic and patriotic scores of modern classics like The Rock and Armageddon but with his own talented, unique stamp on it. Extremely well done from opening scene to closing credits..Overall, I really enjoyed myself. And that's what it all boils down to. Was I entertained? And the answer is wholeheartedly yes. Olympus Has Fallen is fun fiction, yet has all too believable undertones, and pulse- pounding story with characters and action that deliver. I highly recommend it. 8 out of 10Yippie Ka-Yay Mr. President",Olympus Has Fallen
648,Mutahar_Hezam,Good photographed with extra scenes and some racialism,3,7 February 2014,"I think the movie has good contents in the effects, which apparently took a lot of work, but some other things rates it down and made it just somehow similar to other movies or other style of movies, i noticed some weak in the plot, some unconvinced scenes for spectators was scattered within the good photographed movie. Separately, though the efforts to avoid racialism against the Asians, there were some scenes showed high level generalization, in addition to many stereotypes against Asians. Another point the formation of crew maybe did not take enough time or money to balance, for me I believe in creativity in every artist work, i think the movie is just resembled in this point.",Olympus Has Fallen

This movie's contrived dumbness has worn off on me.Not only is the jingoism strong with this film, but so is the corn. Why oh why did I make myself finish watching this unfunny train wreck of a film. What? It wasn't a comedy? Could've fooled me. What with all the slapstick gunfights, shitty plot devices, and the pussiest most lily- livered president in the history of imagination. I would've sworn it was a farce. I guess the farce will be if this trash doesn't end Fuqua's career. But then, if Shame-y-lan still gets greenlit after The Happening...

It is not based on a true story. With that being said - as an action film, a lot of unrealistic effects, script, dialog and chain of events are to be had. If you can get past the obvious ""that wouldn't happen in real life"" scenes then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Definitely full of action - a bit more bloodshed shown than I expected, but still a very great, fast paced movie worth your time.

651,sorrybal,Waste of time,2,9 May 2015,"What a disappointing experience. Very unrealistic. As a president's guest, how can you get into the White House with a gun in your pocket? Highly predictable too. Every tiny bit of suspense has been robbed by over heroic acting. One guy saves the world, a helicopter lands upon him, and he carries on as if nothing ever happened to him. Towards the end, I've been fast forwarding because I just couldn't take anymore. Awful. I cannot believe that Morgan Freeman lends himself for this. He has a reputation to protect doesn't he? Then the body count, completely over the top. I wonder why it got 6.5 out of 10. Not before I've seen such a discrepancy on IMDb, a normally reliable source for me.

652,juancar27,US under attack,3,31 March 2013,"The US has a new archenemy, north Korea. the white house gets taken over, and the president and some other members of his chamber are held hostage by north Korean terrorist in the white house vault, a very secure chamber some couple hundred feet below ground level. My first disappointment with this movie is Ashley Judd dying in the first 5 minutes, however that is just a personal note, she should be able to get better roles. Going back to the movie, my first real disappointment was the inconsistencies regarding national security. How is a unidentified airplane, obviously army looking unidentified airplane able to fly freely until it is over Washington DC, three air force planes try to stop it, but failed, then it took forever to have more air force planes to come and try to stop it. On the ground the terrorists are a coming, and they are being successful, how ever no one is coming to rescue the white house. sure, the inside of the white house is full of secret agents ,that had hand guns, that are throwing themselves to be killed by the terrorists, but they were no were near prepared for this kind of attack, and the army, and air force seemed to be caught in a traffic jam because they were nowhere to be found. i said c'mon. the head terrorist said to the president ""it took 15 minutes for your army to arrive, we took the white house in 13"" well it just seemed that they were all having donuts somewhere because the bad boys had this big heavy trucks with huge cranes drive through the streets of DC amidst all the chaos without any problem and they still got there plenty before any sign of the army. after all of the action of the first half an hour, i must confess that i did enjoy the movie a bit, hence the few stars, Gerard Buttler as a former secret service agent that was demoted by the president after he failed to save his wife, was able to get in the already taken white house and did a good job as the guy, who a la Rambo combated the terrorists and saved the day up until the very end. all throughout the movie he was fighting one, two, three and maybe more, as his character remarked ""very well trained and organized"" terrorists at a time without much problem, however when it was time to fight the terrorists leader, he got a beating, i would had probably understood this better if the leader terrorist would had been another the same size or bigger than Buttler but this a very thin and small Asian men was able to almost conquer Mr 300, perhaps he just was tired after 1 and a half hour of fighting terrorist, but in the end he got some power and won, and then being able to, ta ta taaaa ta taaaa deactivate the nuclear blast in the very last second. all in all i would had left the theater not feeling so bad after seeing this movie, i could had overlooked almost everything in this movie had it ended there, but after all secret agent Gerald Buttler did, rescue the son, president, secretary of state, killing all of those terrorists, stop the nuclear blast, after all of that, all he got was his old job back as the head body guard, i mean another c'mon. at least a ceremony where he is a national hero would had brought the movie together for me, but i guess he did want his old job back and he got it cant deny that.",Olympus Has Fallen

You do, I admit, get your money's worth of violence, with dead bodies strewn all over the White House (or what's left of it).

Well, we were just bracing ourselves for more un-excitement. But what a pleasant turn.This time, screenwriters gave us a believable down-on-luck security officer to identify with; adding fight sequences, that for a change, make you want to get out of your seat and lend somebody a fist; but ultimately, we are given a visceral, choke-able villain to get your hands around that will make anybody re-think our future gun policy.And then there is the matter of the great timing of the release of this film.

But I was really disappointed, not mostly by the direction or acting, but by the plot itself.Dear Mr Morgan, I wonder what made you do this movie. It was boring as hell. No way white house can be attacked in the manner shown in the movie. Just not believable at all. I was really disappointed the way they openly showed North Korea as the attackers. It is just a sign of provoke to me. Did they forget what happened when last year or so a movie was made mocking Muslim. It just gives bad image to whole America.

Seriously, this is the EXACT SAME STORY, only in a different setting! I haven't seen any reviews that point out this glaring fact yet - if they're out there and I missed them, I apologize up front in the case of any repetition! Apparently, Steven Seagal was unavailable for the 3rd installment of the 'UndSeg' trilogy - he's probably busy with some mega-badass projects that call for lots of ponytails and squinting. So what did casting say?? Screw it!! Throw a Scotsman in there to save the American president! Gary Busey can't play the treasonous double-agent part again? No prob, just use Dylan McDermott instead...not as much of a maniac, maybe - but he was in Jersey Girl! Tommy Lee Jones too busy shooting commercials to lead an elite terrorist squad? Can we use a Korean guy instead??

657,anubhavarya,Not a good movie but not bad either,5,29 June 2013,"This movie shows a situation where the white house has been taken over by North Korean paramilitary and the President of the United States taken as hostage.Not that it is even remotely possible to carry firearms big as those anywhere near the white house but hey if its fiction you gotta go with what the movie tells you. And the movie tells you that Americans take a lot of their security for granted. As badly as the movie is written it rests solely on the shoulder of Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart both of which did a fantastic job of playing their respective roles and hence the five stars. I was personally delighted to see Robert Forster the famous drill sergeant turned actor from Full Metal Jacket.There is no denying this movie's stupid scenes which account how Gerard Butler can risk the President's life and tell the North Koreans to shove it. But that's the key to modern day Hollywood action movies. They are not meant to show you reality, instead they are created to focus on things which are not real but have created some great 'What If' questions amongst a thousand others. Not like Superman exists but we love to see him fly around and defeat bad guys. Needless to say real movie buffs know that not the entire movie direction is in the hands of the Director. Producers hand out instructions to directors all the time. And this movie was quite a big budget. So with some bad scenes along with some really nice ones especially the C-130 releasing ""Angel Flares"" to avoid missiles. This movie is definitely fun to watch but not really something you wanna recommend to anybody. No really. Don't.",Olympus Has Fallen
658,josefscharfen,I never write reviews but I have to make an exception for this one...,1,12 April 2013,"I thought the movie would be good - 7.1 rating and excellent actors. And that's actually all, which is good about the movie. So unrealistic and playing the lowest nature of human being, I have actually left the movie theater sad and disgusted with the fact how many people actually cheered out loud during the movie.a) A plane makes it to D.C. before being intercepted by two raptors, which get shot down and after that only ONE raptor is sent to deal with the threat. b) Disregarding the fact that half of the army would already be all over D.C. when the two jets got shot down, the terrorists are now advancing towards the White House on foot - Humvees and choppers are sent out from across the river and the humvees get there first??? c) all the SS agents just run toward the bullets d) president gets captured and the U.S. chain of command will let the nation be destroyed just because of one man e) WH doesn't use the super secret weapon to defend the premises but somehow the terrorists are able to operate it??? f) Blowing up unarmed ICBMs will destroy the nation??? g) At the end when Butler calls in that they are okay, it takes them 5 mins to get out of the building and no one is going in???And two things are absolutely worst: 1) Cheap and cheesy nationalism that should actually make people beware is still working to stir up some pretty strong emotions, especially among those whose necks are two feet wide and heads cleanly shaved. I was absolutely horrifies how many people stop thinking when a flag above WH has bullet holes in it and start punching the air, yelling and all together start behaving like animals... It's actually pretty scary, no wonder some people were scared of garrison state after the Cold War started. We are not far from it today... 2) I wonder who REALLY paid for this crap. So cheesy and appealing to the lowest animal nature of dumb people portraying North Korea as new terrorist threat??? (To be fair in one part of the movie they had to say that people in Middle East were celebrating when seeing the WH captured) How lame and pathetic is this...

Who is this Secretary of Defense? I thought I was watching a low-budget movie during her parts. And what nationality are those who played Koreans in this film? They do not even look korean nor could they even speak the language. They could not even pronounce their one-phrased lines correctly. It is sooooo distracting for anyone who understand the language. total disrespect and turn-off. All those who could understand Korean would cringe. too bad they totally blew it reaching the huge market in Korea. i could only imagine the criticism and outrage 'netizens' in Korea will bash out on this movie. Is it so hard to cast people who can at least speak the language and play the part? All throughout the film i could not help but to think they wanted to pay $3 an hour for a bunch of monkeys in masks blurting out poorly spoken Korean words.

661,m-elizmarie,Not as bad as everyone is making it out to be,8,4 November 2013,"I just watched this movie on Netflix tonight, and I gotta say--it's really not as bad as everybody is making it out to be. Sure, there were some plot holes but it was an attention-holding movie for me. Action movies generally have to have people wondering, ""WHY did this character do this instead of that?! Obviously he should have done THIS."" If the movie was written that way, then it would be a one episode, 25 minute television show which was all wrapped up nice and tidy after a Febreze commercial. I for one found this movie to be exciting, and it's been awhile since a movie actually held my attention from start to finish. I thought it was worth noting that there wasn't too much time spent on smaller plot lines, which made the movie stronger. The action wasn't as cliché as I was expecting, and neither were the character stereotypes. Yes, there is a BAMF for a main character, but the smaller characters, such as the Secretary of Defense, was a well-written role and was not characterized in a manner I would have expected. Same with The President's child--he wasn't portrayed as scared and helpless; he actually had some BAMF qualities as well.I can't give this a 10/10 because one of the main plots was just so wildly unrealistic that it took away from the movie, and the reasoning behind why the terrorists were attacking just wasn't strong enough for me. The ratio of why the terrorists were angry in relations to what they did in regards of it was pretty unbalanced. All in all, I did really like this movie. Gerard Butler was fantastic, and I look forward to seeing him in the sequel. This movie is worth watching.",Olympus Has Fallen

663,judas_rex,It missed the point.,2,22 August 2013,"If you haven't seen ""Olympus has Fallen,"" DON'T! After the first thirty minutes--assuming you can get past that point--it's a mediocre action movie. A mediocre action movie that should've been a decent political thriller. Either that, or died an ignoble death on the cutting room floor somewhere.Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it take practically a full military assault to take over the White House? So why, once that happens, does the ENTIRE JOINT CHIEFS still think it's a terrorist attack? Wasn't the C-130 gunship that strafed downtown DC and managed to shoot down a pair of F-22's before getting splashed enough of a clue? And why, pray tell, once the Big Bad has locked himself inside the President's hardened bunker--with POTUS, the VP, SECDEF, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and a visiting foreign dignitary as hostages--does the Pentagon order the troops to STAND DOWN? Especially a Big Bad that has shown a willingness to both use merciless and overwhelming force against his opponents (ref: the initial assault. Every one of the guards at the White House were killed. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Even the wounded were executed.) and execute hostages at will (He killed the South Korean Prime Minister as soon as he connected the video call to the Pentagon. I guess he needed to make sure they were listening).There's other crap, but basically that's the first thirty minutes. Don't worry, it gets better.Let's not forget that the Big Bad snuck in posing as a member of the South Korean PM's entourage. How much do you wanna bet he's really North Korean? Guess what he wants? Launch codes? Nope, they're changed immediately and he knows it. He says he wants the US out of Korea. He really wants the codes to self destruct the nuclear ICBM's in case of accidental launch. Why? Because the explosions of the missiles in their silos will detonate the warheads and irradiate huge tracts of land causing famine and poverty across America just like North Korea has.... WHAT???Now I know f-ck-all about nuclear weapons, but even I know that isn't possible. Anyone with half a brain knows that you can blow up a nuke without it going Hiroshima on everybody. Anyone with a full brain knows that ICBM silos are designed to GET nuked and still mostly survive, at least long enough to launch back, and therefore would likely contain most of the radiation. So no worries there. You'd think that somebody that's smart enough to never be identified in two decades would know this.The dialogue isn't much better. The quips are mostly bad apes of Die Hard. It did have its moments of decency, though. Most went to the Big Bad. though. He was the only one that sounded even semi-intelligent. Is there a rule somewhere that says that only the bad guys are allowed to be smart in movies? The only saving grace this movie has is Morgan Freeman. His portrayal of the Speaker of the House and Acting President--at least initially--is actually pretty good. When he orders coffee and takes charge I kept thinking that this stinker was going to get better. Alas, it didn't. Sorry, Morgan, but I finally found a movie of yours I can't stand.The premise would have made a pretty decent political thriller, but I think it completely missed the point. Overall, if you can suspend your disbelief after the first thirty minutes, you might almost enjoy a mediocre action movie. If you can't, avoid it like the plague.",Olympus Has Fallen

Nothing more than that though. The plot is the usual terrorist attack and the usual hero that saves the day. The only original feature is that it all happens inside the White House. Some details in the plot could be more realistic. And parts of it I found strangely predictable. Still loads of people in the cinema applauded at several points and I felt inclined to join (never did though). I liked the bad guy. He was a no nonsense bad guy that I wanted to beat up. That means that his acting was good. The before mentioned applaud was at that point.Boys are gonna watch it because its a nice action movie with loads of fights/shooting/killing/guns etc. Girls are gonna watch it because of Gerald Buttler (according to the female friend that accompanied me to the screening)Nevertheless both should feel satisfied at the end of the movie... or was it the pizza...?? oh well...,Olympus Has Fallen

I was in no rush to see this movie, although Gerard Butler looked like he was going to put on a show. But I made the trip, and I was thoroughly impressed.Butler put on a show that no past, present, or future Bruce Willis could mimic in a Die Hard movie. In the first 5 minutes of the movie, it had me hypnotized. Non-stop thrilling action that you can not afford to miss. If you have had any second thoughts on seeing a showing, take my word for it, you will not be sorry that you went. Olympus Has Fallen is a must see!",Olympus Has Fallen
676,devendude,Big well done to Gerard Butler,6,19 April 2013,"O yes. Olympus has Fallen is a straightforward 3 star slam bang action movie.It doesn't pretend to be anything other than a piece of entertainment. I thought Gerard Butler was more than capable of carrying this movie on his own. With some fantastic one liners and has the charm, looks and physique to nail the role of an all out action hero who ultimately does the job an entire force of US Marines, Special Forces and Secret Service agents are unable to do. (Which was a bit silly at times for me, they were running around like cannon fodder). Granted, an all star cast has very little to do besides set up Gerard's glory, but then Butler was one of the producers of the film so why not?It's good to see Ashley Judd back on our screens, albeit too briefly in the set up and Aaron Eckhart just does what needs to do in the role of President Benjamin Asher. Morgan Freeman's role as Speaker Trumbull was very disappointing, i think he is still one of the best actors in the game, but not in this. Also Angela Bassett as the Secret Service Director was another disappointment for me, whats happened to the woman we love and have seen in all those great films she has done. She looked board and wooden. Melisa Leo as Secretary of Defense, who (literally) takes one for the team late on in this movie (and that isn't a spoiler). She is fantastic as always.In all then, this is a popcorn movie that the boys can enjoy on a night out with the lads, but if you do go with a lady they can enjoy it just for Gerard being tough and charismatic.Oh, and it gives Gerard Butler one of this year's best ""YippeeKayAye"" moments when he gets to tell the villain; ""Let's play a game called f**k off. You go first!"" Big well done to Gerard Butler",Olympus Has Fallen

If you don't care, this is a very entertaining movie.",8,24 March 2013,"This is definitely not a documentary type of movie so if you're expecting for one, then skip this one. This has a lot of unrealistic things going and so if you are easily annoyed by those type of movies, you'll definitely hate this movie.To set a good base, recent movies I enjoyed above all others are: Transformers, Avatar, Battleship, Amazing Spiderman, Prometheus, etc... So if you liked most of those in the list, I will guarantee you that you will definitely like this movie too.This movie has a lot of far fetch happenings that definitely cannot and will not happen in the next century (if US stayed as superpower for that long).But, once in a while, we would like to play ""what if's"" in our heads.

678,briankeithferguson,Good Action movie but..,7,8 July 2013,"I really enjoyed this movie however I think it does a disservice to our nation to show in a movie or whatever, enemies allowed such an ""easy"" take over of one of our nations most secure locations.Lets just look at the IRL stuff. The SAM (Surface-to-Air Missiles) batteries only fired I believe 1 shot, maybe two missiles, but what about the rest on that rack, what about the other batteries. And wow, two planes shot down and they have nothing in th air to engage? And they seriously make that ""machine gun weapon"" on the roof of the White House look ridiculous. I forget what it's called, but that thing doesn't miss, those choppers would be dust in seconds. Those guns can actually intercept incoming missiles and rockets, i think they can handle a couple of helicopters. Just saying it makes our technology look weak, and do we really need to look weak these days? I do believe even if caught off guard as they clearly did in the movie, it would not fall so quick and easily. However i do concede, given the fact that there is so little ground between the publicly accessible area touching the outer fence and secured area past it, that I suppose given that the defenses not shown in the movie failed, perhaps it could happen, as you know anything is indeed possible.So all that I'm trying to say by all that mess is at least make the bad guys work for it or give a better reason why they just walked in past our nations finest, such as more of an inside man job or something, i don't know.Now onto the movie itself. I thought it was pretty entertaining. Who doesn't love Gerald Butler kicking some bad guy tail. I would expect there was a lot that got cut out of this as Morgan Freeman didn't see much screen time as acting President making the tough calls.Overall good movie if you can ignore the ""that shouldn't happen that way, so if your friends often tell you, ""its just a movie..."" then watch it alone.

That is all I'm here to rectify. White House Down was an unrealistic action movie with a lot of humor and nice shots of things exploding. This movie is grim. That's all. {the following contains some spoilers about the beginning of the movie}If they were going for ""realistic"" they really shouldn't have landed an entire army right on top of the White House's doorstep without anyone stopping them, shouldn't have killed of the entire secret service in 1 bottle neck, and shouldn't have done all those other incredibly unrealistic things that were scattered throughout the entire movie. I understand that there is a trend nowadays to make every movie as grim as possible, I don't understand why, but it's there. Still, if you are going to focus on that, at least make a credible story to place all your death and torture in. A lot of people compare it with Die Hard, but the reason we forgive Die Hard for all of its illogicalness is because it is funny. Incredibly funny. I think that the first real joke I've heard in Olympus Has Fallen was in the very last scene. That is why the movie didn't work for me. Unrealistic without humor. Too bad, because most of the actors performed really well.",Olympus Has Fallen

The story wasn't good, I am shocked how can actors like Gerard Butler and Morgan freeman agree to take part in a movie with such a movie. Personally I am a big fan of Gerard Butler but, if Gerard Butler(Mike Banning) could have killed them all, why did United states even had an army, he could have fought all the wars of his country on his own. He was like a super man, who fell from the top floor way down and he was still alive and managed to kill the remaining people. They should have made it a bit realistic.

My biggest gripe is that the movie failed miserably to make my ""believe"" the story, at any point of the movie. The ease with which the bad guys take over the White House and outsmart the Americans every step of the way was far too unbelievable, IMHO. Plus, there and I don't want to give a spoiler here, so I'll just say that a couple of sub-plots were woefully undeveloped. I love Morgan Freeman (who doesn't?), but unfortunately not only was he not present enough to save the movie, the script and direction left him sorely handicapped. Similar story for Gerard Butler, who was very present throughout as our leading character, but for me, never truly shined. Perhaps I was blinded to their otherwise good performances by my utter anger at having actually paid $30 at the theater for us to go see this yawner of a wasted film best left for Redbox, if not the dumpster. I only give it 3 because, well, my wife agreed it was awful but that it didn't rate the lowly 1 I was ""going"" to give it ... a plot with such good promise, an opportunity squandered by a director whose movies I'll be much more suspect of in the future.",Olympus Has Fallen

The movie was well scripted, entertaining, great action scenes, plot keeps you entertained and wanting to find out more, great one liners, and a true patriotic American ending where the whole audience clapped once the bad guy was killed and at the end of the film. Overall Olympus has fallen is a great movie! The only downside would be the script is a little bland but the movie's well makes up for that and it makes it a very enjoyable two hours.

If you think about movies..all movies have a good ending. Except for a couple of good films. But all I'm saying is that movies nowadays are ending up the same.

Oh, and let's add the obvious plot-holes and general retardedness of the whole story, and we got the generic 80s and early 90s action movies. Except, this was made for release in 2013.

This is pure, 100% high octane, high body count entertainment. It's a roller coaster movie. This being said, obviously there are plot holes (how did they smuggle enough guns to arm 40 commandos into D.C.? even American citizens can't do that) but there is a little thing called suspension of disbelief. Obviously this could never happen. Special Forces would come down on any White House trespasser like a bat out of hell and reduce them to little more then burnt dust and blood splatters. For an action movie, the acting is good, the gunfights are intense, the hand-to-hand is brutal, and the patriotism flows as readily as the blood from the bad guys skulls.

Worthless movie, unless you are a nationalist and get tears in your eyes of the USA flag..... In my opinion this is pure (badly made) propaganda.

Yes, they're portrayed as pretty evil but what do you expect for fanatical terrorists? Other than the inept defense by the Secret Service the initial assault was a pretty good job of using a stealth attack to defeat a superior foe. (But really now, a backpack bomb blowing a hole in a ironwork fence?? The blast would just go through it!) The C-130 also wasn't nearly as unreasonable as some are saying. It would have had no problem getting there, there are multiple civilian airports in the area. Only when it deviated from the flightplan would the alert go up. They were stupid to put both Raptors next to it, though--one would be on it's six instead. They also would have probably sent only one Raptor after it after the first two were shot down--they would have sent the first bird with a missile that was available, he wouldn't have waited for a wingman. Note that the C-130 had no means of defeating the radar-guided missile, one Raptor was enough.After that, though, everything falls apart. No terrorist group can do something this elaborate without government backing. After the Cerebrus incident I don't think Pyongyang would exist anymore. (Not that such a system would work that way, anyway. Even if you send a detonation command the missiles aren't going to go off in their silos because the warhead safeties won't have released yet. Furthermore, such a destruct would certainly not involve a nuclear yield. If you need to destruct a nuke you fire one of it's detonators. It's smashed but it doesn't go nuclear.)",Olympus Has Fallen

This movie is ultranationalist and creates in the mind of the average citizen of USA the idea that everyone is against them and want to conquer them and destroy them for no reason when Americans are the massagers of peace in the world and they should teach others what to do. 2. The main character played by Jason Butler or whatever is his name plays very well to the average chump who in his subconscious identifies himself very well with this character who is a superhero apparently without putting any effort(He can fight lime me he can swear like me he's tough just like me :) I remember that psychologist Paul Dobransky was saying that we enjoy and like movies that we identify ourselves with the character. This says it all. The main character is tailored specifically to mould on the average aggressive chump. 3. When pe population of US is united it's called Patriotism. When any other country or communion of people is united and fights for its identity like countries from the Western Europe it's called Nationalism. Way to go America. This movie just make me sick and added up to the disgust that already had towards the values of this way of living. Got nothing against American people. In fact if you'd read all the 1* rating you'd be surprised how many were disgusted by this movie.

Let's explain my idea! 1. In every country there are some areas which you can not fly there! entering them is absolutely causes a very aggressive respond! In the first wave, the airplane fly over a critical zone and pilots want to look inside an unknown airplane to check it! the funniest part is that both of the pilots do it together!!2. After two fighters were destroyed and the air strike to president place began, the Air force send just one airplane to engage the hostile airplane which has already took down two fighters!! 3. The guards went to the roof to take down an airplane with heavy guns by sniper rifles and machine guns!!!!4. After the attack, no one send ground units and back up to the zone for more protection! No one thought that every air strike may be the beginning of a very wider ground attack!!! 5. Is white house inside an abandon island?!!! Washington has no police department?! Usually in critical times, all cops are sent to the area! Why SWAT and special forces do not use choppers to reach the area very fast?!! If a bank is raided in Washington, the cops must logically reach there later than the time they need to reach to White house?!!! So in this case please give me a list of the banks in Washington! I really like to be rich!6. Every bunker has a few hidden exits for emergency times! Why this bunker is a prison?!! These exists are sometimes very far from the original place and the guards can easily transform VIP's very fast to a very safe and far place! Why the president must stay in his bunker while the white house was too close to be captured?!!! 7. The raiders used two heavy guns in trucks to clear the entrance. Why they must explode the tires?! Heavy guns can fire even behind lighter vehicles like pickups! Why they neglect the mobility?! Was it necessary? 8. Inside the White House there is no AT rockets like Bazooka for disabling heavy hostile vehicles or AA rockets like stinger for disabling airplanes?!! 9. Most of the guards walk and shoot in suits! Where were their armors?!!! Did they think they are invited to a party?!!!! 10. Every critical zone has some hidden heavily armed guards which are not seen and felt but always ready to respond any possible strike! Where were they?!!!! 11. The hostile ground units used two kamikaze men to break the wall. Why they must do such a thing?!! They had no remote control to explode the jacket from distance?! There was just one man who might stop them! Why the raiders did not use trucks to break the wall much more easily?!!!12. Highly trained soldiers and mercenaries, use snipers to clear zone! Why these raiders did not use a big group of snipers? There is no need to use heavy guns in trucks to kill people who fight with pistols and small machine guns!!! All of them can be killed faster by snipers!!!If you want to watch a movie with no logic but with a lot of shooting! this is a very good choice! but if you can not recline and watch a movie with no logic! find another movie!",Olympus Has Fallen

703,JellevdSchoot,Awful,3,22 September 2013,"I watch a lot of movies and I've seen some terrible things (movies), but Olympus has Fallen just captured the #1 rank of my 'Baddest movies' list. The movie is a typical Hollywood failure: lots of gunfire, explosions and lots of clichés. As soon as it became clear what the movie was about, we could all fill in the storyboard, including the ending of the movie.There's no story and it's very unrealistic. That's OK - normally - but this was just awful. There were some funny jokes, but that's about it. The actor list seems good and the director has made great movies, so I don't quite understand what he did here. Let's hope he gets back on the right track.Save yourself the embarrassment: skip this one!",Olympus Has Fallen

Good storyline: not out of this world different but got it. After seeing this movie, I have so much more pride in my country. The only bad thing about this movie is that too many of the good guys die and it makes you want the antagonists to die a long horrible torturous death but of course that would take too long and it wouldn't be very tasteful. There is enough screen time of the actors who matter and even for the supporting actors. For a movie trying to shove historical/political conspiracies together into a 1-2 hour movie, they did a pretty good job. Watch it if you want a good popcorn action movie. Oh, and Gerard isn't so bad on the eyes either! (;",Olympus Has Fallen
705,jamesmaslowski,Great Action Flick,8,18 March 2013,"Granted, I did not have much information about this movie prior to seeing it last week at an advanced screening. Some crazy action stuff that may be hard to believe, but if you just think Die Hard in the White House and just enjoy the movie for what it is, a good action flick that you can enjoy. Great villain who people cheered when he got killed. Good effects and great job by the cast, Gerard Butler got to be a badass and keeps the movie enjoyable. A lot of the stuff away from the White House felt a little flat and Morgan Freeman feels a little underutilized with this role, but overall I think the movie keeps a decent pace. While it doesn't bring anything really new or groundbreaking but still enjoyable and entertaining and worth seeing. I think that using North Korean terrorists was a different change of pace that was noticeable. Flawed but hadly unwatchable. Think of the first Die Hard movie where Bruce Willis kicked ass and you will enjoy it.",Olympus Has Fallen

The government would have shot that down in a matter of seconds. Second, there should have been a few more people guarding the White House. There was nobody out on the lawn and the terrorists were able to shoot away. Btw, all the Seccret Service agent were quite stupid. They all just ran out the door and got shot. Lastly, why did it take the government so long to say, ""Hey we should see whats going on at the White House.

If you're expecting an over the top ""Die Hard"" stunt fest peppered with dumb quips, be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. This is an efficient thriller designed to put you on the edge of your seat and keep you there till the very end. The assault on the WH was insane, with the same raw intensity of the first 20 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"". (And yes, the memories of 9/11 made it even more of a gut punch.) Fuqua is not pulling any punches. The violence is real and unvarnished. But lest you get pounded into submission, you have charismatic Gerard Butler story of redemption. That's where Creighton and Katrin Rothenberger's lean, taut, juggernaut of a screenplay does its job best. The stakes are high. And sh** gets real. Real fast. Butler is solid as the haunted former secret service stud taking the fight to the terrorists. . Morgan Freeman is great as the Speaker of the house who suddenly has the scariest job in the world. Angela Bassett keeps it real (and smokin hot) as head of the secret service. Rick Yune is believable as a cold-blooded shot-caller who could f*** Gerard Butler up. (His crew is scary.)

It has a wonderful romantic beginning and yet keeps the typical 'chick-flick' elements to a minimum. The action parts of it are as destructive as Independence Day. The plot may need a bit more, but amidst all this action, who really minds? Olympus Has Fallen has all the attraction of a 1990's action flick. When you see the other reviews of ""Die Hard in the White House"", believe them! I do wish to add, that Butler's role of that disgruntled agent doesn't really describe him well. It is more like Eastwood's In the Line of Fire- in that he has a redemption opportunity and then proves that he can be the hero. Butler's Mike Banning is indeed a composite of many action heroes from the 1990's, but that is why I, as a gal, liked this just as well as my husband did!",Olympus Has Fallen
709,historyandgrace,Makes the Original Die Hard Look Like Child's Play,9,23 March 2013,"In the original Die Hard film, which was great for its time, the setting was a high rise building in Downtown Los Angeles. The characters who were most vulnerable to a terrorist attack were the 20+ people enjoying a Christmas Party on one of the mid-level floors. Our hero, the one who would save his wife and the other hostages, is the unsuspecting John McClane, a New York City police officer with a bad boy attitude. Trying to top the first (and maybe even the second) Die Hard film is like trying to fly a plane through the Washington Monument, then crushing the White House. You simply couldn't ever do it.That is, until Antoine Fuqua grabbed onto the script for Olympus Has Fallen and shook his audiences with one of the most intense action scenes ever to take place on American soil. Imagine Red Dawn and multiply the realism of devastating an American city by 100 and you'll come close to experiencing what moviegoers witnessed at theaters during the opening weekend of Olympus.When I went out for a Saturday afternoon matinée, I'll admit that I was expecting a B-Grade film with corny acting and horrible lines. Olympus was anything but bad. Every time you expected to see an actor pull out a cliché, the characters had amazing restraint. Every time you expected a bad guy to show some unbelievable mercy, the good guys would mercilessly fall at the hands of a gruesome terrorist. And every time you expected the hero to say something goofy after killing a bad guy (trying to be like McClane), there was usually silence; allowing the audience to soak in the intensity of the slaughter. As part of that audience, I thoroughly enjoyed almost every aspect of this movie, despite having to suspend bits of reality that seemed to go away during the rush of storytelling.Normally, I check the time on my phone at some point during a movie (against all those rules that say keep your phone off), but with Olympus, I never looked one time. This was edge-of-your-seat entertainment that made the original Die Hard movie look like child's play.",Olympus Has Fallen

I was ten items past the line 5 minutes into the main ""taking over the white house"" scene. After i made the decision to absolutely not look at the movie with any kind of authentic merit, the movie itself got much much...well, it was actually pretty silly the entire time. Good news is, the movie has lots of murder and brain stabbing. Also, there is a hilarious pledge of allegiance scene. Bad news is the plot and actions taken to get everything to the next stage were completely unbelievable, the writing was abysmal, and i think i have made the decision that i am done with CGI.

It failed as a drama, as an action flick and just wasn't bad enough to be campy, although it came close.I did spend a lot of time laughing at how bad it was, so maybe it did succeed as a comedy, albeit unintentionally.

713,princess-nicolerice,Works because it's so real,7,24 March 2013,"""Olympus Has Fallen"" works because it is so real. Putting aside the bit of exaggeration and slight plot problems, the movie does a good job. It's otherwise easy to follow, and the acting conveys a true sense of fear. Perhaps I'm a bit bias being (arguably) Gerard Butler's greatest fan, but the acting by the President and Acting President fits perfect with the movie's tone.I love this action film because it is so real, and doesn't need fancy CGI or SFX to make it look good- it plays off the sense of fear we as Americans have. It really makes me angry when I read reviews that criticize its ""R"" rating and lack of ""action"" (which I highly disagree with, as the violence is convincing and the action COULD happen) because they fail to realize that a good movie plays off emotion, not fancy editing work.Also, I was sickened when people in the theater laughed at people's death and the slight bouts of humor (although, I giggled when Gerard described the day as just a rough day in the office. These humorous lines are defense mechanisms in real life, and keeping with the idea that this can happen makes laughter unthinkable. And just because we killed the bad guy (which there were way too many of in the film), doesn't mean we should laugh. Really, it's a human life... and really...a death in the context of this movie isn't funny. Sorry to rant, but this movie really shouldn't be filled with hefty belly laughs...Overall- great, real film with great, real acting and effects. It just goes a slight overboard (I feel) with the amount of terrorists there and the quickness (or sometimes lack) of response by others.",Olympus Has Fallen

Only Hollywood could come up with something this ridiculous.The premise is farcical and totally unbelievable. This is pure fantasy. I expect anyone with any military experience to get up and walk out. This is Hollywood bashing an inept US military all over again yet Hollywood can't get any of their facts right. Never mind reality, let's just make a fantastic shoot-em-up with lots of explosions and a big body count. The plot plays on public fear of nuclear bombs going off accidentally, but the story line is completely self-contradictory, it can but it can't.What bothers me is, unlike Jack the Giant Slayer, people might actually believe this nonsense.

They protected America to the fullest of their abilities due to the horrific circumstances they were under. It is heart-stirring because it really makes you think about what you would do if you were in a situation like that. America was at risk of being blown up completely. It really moved me because I know I wouldn't have been as strong or brave as Gerard Butler, as the main character, Banning. It is heart-stopping because there are moments that are thrilling, meaning you do not know what will happen until it actually happens. It may have massive amounts of killing and I know, thou shalt not kill. But it's so well written, directed and acted. 2 hours of riveting action and mesmerizing entertainment. Never a dull moment.

716,carlstovermusic,"A much needed break, hopefully a sign that things are looking up",8,27 March 2013,"I won't call this the greatest film I've seen, but when you look at the drawl of mediocre sequels and crappy remakes that Hollywood has been cranking out for the past few years, this film is definitely one worth while. I did my best to go into the theater with NO expectations, that way I could go either way in terms of approval or disapproval. Overall I approve. The film had a very nice flow to it, and brought a sort of old- school feel to theater. You'll probably hear people describe this as what Die Hard 5 should've been, or what it would be like if Die Hard went to DC. That does place it fairly well. This film is certainly reminiscent of the legendary Die Hard series, but somehow manages not to do a total rip-off. The cast was well picked, though I do wonder if names like Morgan Freeman were picked just to beef it up. Regardless, overall I'd give the actors a 9/10. Butler did a very good job, and Angela Bassett and Rick Yune were very memorable and convincing in their roles. Eckhart has seen better days in his career, but his performance was enough to be convincing at the very least. The story had a nice flow to it which is something I miss very much in films. There were small twists here and there, but all in all it fit together. The action sequences were well done, though I think Hollywood devotes too much time to FX and not enough to a good movie. The dialog was questionable though, at times. I felt like some of it was just too cliché, or just flat out poorly placed. I think the characters could've been much more had they had better lines. With a better script and perhaps more character development, this movie would've gone incredibly far. But as I said, in comparison to what's been coming out, this movie is a much needed break. All in all, it's worth watching with some friends once or twice. *A note to parents though, that the invasion on the White House could give the opening scene from Private Ryan a run for it's money. It's much more gruesome than the R-rating might hint at. Other than that, this movie is a very enjoyable action flick, hopefully a sign that things are looking up in the movie industry.",Olympus Has Fallen
717,sf340,I wanted this film to be good,2,30 March 2013,"OK first off, I love these types of movies. I went into this expecting a fun movie, lots of action, etc. It had the action, but.... This movie was just terrible in general. The movie makes its major mistake by assuming that a gun to a presidents head, will cause us to move battle groups out of countries, move Navies to other oceans, etc. Really? In reality the president is just a man who in a sense is disposable. The Presidency is different. That would be the office. That we protect at all costs. We have a chain of command, if the president is killed, we have others who fill the void. But this movie, wants us to think that just because our president (the man) is being held hostage, that we are going to move all our soldiers out of the DMZ, we are going to move our Navy out of the China Sea, etc. And the Govt does! Really? That is the whole plot. Okay i can look past this. But after 40 min of looking past so many things, i realized this movie just has no legs to stand on. They send in the Navy Seals, not on the ground in the dark, but in noisy helicopters that of course get shot down by the bad guys. Hmmm. The very cool C130 shots at the start of the movie, had nothing to do with the rest of the film. A c130 shoots up DC then gets shot down. Hmmm. What does that have to do with kidnapping the president? In fact the C-130 crashed accidentally into the white house, and could have killed the one person they were trying to take hostage, the President! I was expecting a bunch of paratroopers to jump out of it to take control of the White House, never happened. All the C130 did was alert everyone that the bad guys were coming. And where was our military? First off somehow the jets that do go up to talk with the c130 both get shot down by it. Really? When the bad guys storm the front of the white house, ALL the secret service just run out into a barrage of machine gun fire...no one takes cover. Except out star, who is great in this movie. In the bunker we find that the bad guys are trying to get 3 codes from the hostages. Once they get the 3 codes they can destroy America. Three different hostages have their own code. So when the kidnappers ask for the codes, the Presidents tells the Admiral and the Secretary of State, to give the codes to the bad guys. Really? You have got to be kidding me. So they get two codes, and then a computer somehow just figures out the third code. Hmmm. Also, our military had the white house surrounded, but never goes inside. No intead they listen to the bad guys and just hang out around the outside, doing nothing. Hmmm. You know, any movie you have to look past some stuff, but in this film it just keeps adding up. And what i listed was just a brief example of things i attempted to overlook. Most the audience i was with, felt similar to me, based on all the comments. Just a mess of a film.

The plot needed to be more suspenseful. The role played by Aaron Eckhart as President was least impressive. I particularly rate his performance better as Harvey Dent in Dark Knight. His character does not portray leadership skills ; on the other hand , Gerald Butler seemed too HIGH and OVER as a presidential guard. I particularly enjoyed when the audience clapped at Rick Yune's (Korean Villain) training history ( you got to watch to know why)I don't know why Morgan Freeman was not chosen in the role of President.His acting skills were not fully utilized as most of the times he remained quiet.I rate this movie 6/10",Olympus Has Fallen

Thanks to a traitor ex-secret service agent who espouses occupy wall street catchphrases the Koreans commandos gain access to the secure bunker, killing all secret service agents in the White House and thus eliminating all future unfunded liabilities in personnel while the South Korean PM and some cabinet officials are graphically executed. alas the Army comes rolling along into town with tanks, Bradleys, helicopters, and hundreds of armed infantrymen....... two minutes too late""Olympus"" (the super secret code word for the White House) is now under foreign occupation, at least 100 cops from varying agencies lay dead and dying, the Washington monument has collapsed, and the Rose Garden has burned to the ground, it's panic button time, and Speaker of the House Alan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) is declared the president under action movie code 56.7B stating the Morgan Freeman must be the president when the stakes are high. Enter Special Agent Michael Banning (Gerard Butler) the disgraced Secret Service Agent who has partial responsibility for the death of the first lady. After seeing the initial strike of the hijacked AC-130 from his desk job in the Treasury, he sees the opportunity for redemption (not to mention overtime) and runs towards the firefight at the whitehouse, head shotting (BTW about half the people killed in the movie are by head shot, I guess all that Zombie preparation is really getting to people) several Korean commandos and entering the whitehouse, where he is Americas only hope to stop the apocalyptic plans of Kang, the Korean mastermind....The movie has a predictable plot, the combined forces of at least 30 federal LEAs plus the US Marines and Navy SEALs are basically slaughtered by ruthless elite commandos without ever having the chance to fire the 1.6 billion rounds they've been ordering, while the lone hero effortlessly exterminates the offending invaders. The end of the movie is the ticking time bomb scenario in which millions of people are saved with seconds to spare. originality is not this movie's middle name. The characterization is good, Aaron Eckart, while younger looking, is presidential enough for the role. Rick Yune plays the Evil and heartless Kang, the villain of the movie, and I wouldn't be shocked to see him in another blockbuster, he's got real talent that I would love to see in the future. Morgan Freeman's skill is undebated, and even the B-list actors played well. This is not a movie to take the kiddies to, violence is graphic and often gratuitous, chances are if Saving Private Ryan made you sick this is not for you. However there is no nudity or sexual references. As for guns? got lots... it seems Kang and his crew are Glock Fanboys, there's a ton of scoped remmy 700s, I think it's a law that remmys are in every action movie.. Butler seems to switch between his Sig P229 and a gun that I believe is a 1911, probably a Kimber. The first half of the movie though everyone was carrying Sigs, I couldn't help but believe the 13 minute scene where half the bad guys were also carrying P229s was a running commercial for Sig Sauer.... P-90s, AR-15s, and MP-5s abound, in addition to numerous knife fights and graphic knife killings. Overall 5/10 for the graphic and predictable, but suspenseful Olympus Has Fallenrecommendation, wait for the DVD.",Olympus Has Fallen
731,marceloveronezzi,"Fail so hard trying to be the new ""Die Hard"" ...",3,9 November 2013,"Damn , i've never before wrote a review at IMDb, but ""seeing"" this movie i had a urge to come here and warn all the possible future watchers to avoid at all costs this film...Don't get fooled: even having Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd acting, it's so unreal that even if any of them did an Oscar performance, the movie would still sucks...I think the director/writer of this movie watched all Die Hard's films and thought that would be a brilliant move use the plot of an invasion an take over of White House where just one tough man could clean all the mess up ( even if the ENTIRE force of Washington were run over at the beginning of the movie )...Don't take me wrong, i LOVED the Die Hard movies and i don't mind see a film that has plot holes... But when the Die Hard's movies creates some forced situations, but that are plausible, i'm OK with that... But at ""Olympus Has Fallen"" the situations are unreal that i couldn't stand see it past the take over...Just some points... A simple plane with two side turrets can reach the White House after take over 2 F-15, avoid missile turrets aiming for it at ground, while shooting random citizens for no point... Reaching there it was finally taken down... Oh gosh, the White House team won!!! No yet: from nowhere a group of about 50-100 north koreans disguised as TOURISTS O.o breach the gate, opening fire against all the security left, and obviously breaching the building... Worst of all: at the bunker were the President and the South Korea minister were hiding, we discover that the whole crew of Korea minister is actually a decoy, and there they wipe out all the security members to get their hands at the president...REALLY??? the guy that wrote the plot, and the director that accept to shot this story must had be seriously stoned to think that it would be good... I mean, everyone that liked Die Hard can watch the movies thinking ""hmm, it is hard to believe, but it could happened...""... That with John Maclane's character, doing his job but in a WTF way, leads the audience to enjoy the franchise...But here, we get just an absurd history, with plain characters, with no memorable moments, when all the actions scenes we keep think "" Seriously that they want me to accept that bullsh*t?"" I gave 3 stars just for the first scene of the movie at Camp David (that made me believe that the film would be good) and invasion to the White House ( it's a cool scene, but it lose all meaning cause it's totally unbelievable ) ...Resume: it try to be a new ""Die Hard"" movie, but is a complete fail cause all scenes you will see will make you think that all security force at United States is directed/ruled by morons and that if you could find some pals and buy some guns your crew could too invade and kidnap the president too ... ¬¬ Don't get me wrong, like i said i have no problems seeing a movie that has plot holes, but when they are plausible... In the same field of ""Olympus Has Fallen"" i would recommend instead ""Air Force One"" ... Harrison Ford being a president that fall under a terrorist attack same as Olympus, but different from that, ""Air Force One"" is believable, thing that ""Olympus Has Fallen"" is FAR , FAR AWAY ...",Olympus Has Fallen

This has got heaps of action, an drama but its not very realistic. I personally prefer a movie that's not too realistic, cause we have life for that. Don't bother watching the movie if you're going too point out every single mistake. For readers I don't want to say don't watch it, or do watch it but what I mean is this is something to watch just for fun like everything else. All in all if you hate action don't waste your time, but if you adore action movies this is a number one must see, especially for Die Hard fans.(most of you might say that this is a better idea for Die Hard 5, than the current crap.)",Olympus Has Fallen

Even those who suspend all disbelief before watching action films will be scratching their heads all through this. Scratching their heads and wondering why they bothered with this shonky film.The CGI is very poor. I have seen better CGI on TV series. The plot is flimsy at best, and when the Hydra 6 kicks into action, you will be either dry-wretching, or running for the exit.I had to force myself to watch past the 10min mark, and it was all downhill from there. I found myself laughing and swearing at the screen, at several points in the movie, I raised my hands and made my best ""WTF are you doing?... Pull the power plug you idiot!!"" face.This film is CERTAINLY NOT Die Hard, it is not Die Hard 4.0 (which admittedly had some decent CGI stunts), It is not even Die Hard 6: Die Harder For Another Two Hours. This film will make you feel physically ILL !! It is truly THAT BAD, and not in the SO BAD IT IS GOOD category.If I were able, I would give this film a rating of DNF instead of a score. It is a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE movie. It should never have even made it past the SCRIPT PHASE.AWFULLY AWFUL.",Olympus Has Fallen

736,Michael77777,More than an average action movie,8,23 June 2013,"First of all I want to say that I read a lot about people complaining that this movie is all too unrealistic. Admittedly the movie has some scenes which can make you wonder a bit. But I think one must see that it's always hard for the movie makers to do the split between an authentic or realistic plot and visually stunning pictures. In my opinion especially some of these scenes really contribute to thrill the audience. Here I want to mention the aircraft scenes, the ""flying tank"" and the Hydra – I definitely wouldn't have wanted to miss these scenes and neither will you.Once Butler in person of former Secret Service Agent Mike Banning has made it into the White House the party really gets started. He builds up a great one man show and never lets you get bored. Also it has plenty action scenes the storyline is always pushed straight forward. At no point from now on you think about how realistic this or that may be, you're just like 'What if the bad guys come through with this."" –No way because we have this charismatic warrior knocking the intruders off one by one.But then appears this one bad guy – Rick Yune displays Banning's counterpart and evil mastermind Kang. From the first step on he leaves no doubts that he will do whatever it takes to achieve his aims. Without any hesitation he starts killing and torturing his hostages – with a smile on his lips showing that he exactly knows how to handle things. There out develops a grudge match between Banning and Kang. As Banning comes closer and closer to thwart Kang's plans Kang comes closer and closer to accomplish them. The suspense increases until their final duelEventually I'm offering a positive summary of ""Olympus Has Fallen"". Although it remains faithful to the genre, it's way more than an average action movie.8/10 from Michael",Olympus Has Fallen

I'm a very hard critic of movies and it's very rare I rate a movie a 10 but I did with this one. The acting was excellent, the story line was great and the action kept you on the edge of your seat. My husband said he couldn't believe how realistic it was - but I read online that previous C.I.A. agents and military personnel played a key role in the making of this movie. I enjoyed how the movie built up the suspense right up until the end. If you liked the following movies: ""A Few Good Men"", ""The Day After"", ""Air Force One"", ""Clear and Present Danger"", and ""True Lies"", then you'll love this movie! The news is now reporting that a new movie is coming out called White House Down - I wonder if this will be a copy cat to this excellent movie. I'm looking forward to the awards for this year because Olympus Has Fallen should definitely be up for some awards! By the way, my favorite type of movies are action, suspense and thriller.

738,stormening,yet another action flick,4,27 June 2013,"At first glance, it looks like a great example of an awesome movie. However, after the first 5 minutes, you can actually predict the outcome of the main character's (banner) dilemma and his development throughout the story - therefor we know that he will redeem himself. the action is good, impressive and comprehensive hence the relative big budget, which is the only thing, that's going for the movie. While Banner is within the White House, the dialog and script take a turn for the worse. The dialog is poorly constructed and based on clichés.

Script appears to have been selected from the ""Special Olympics of Hollywood"". I wonder of Butler and Morgan were sober when they signed up for this movie, or maybe they were handed an offer they couldn't refuse... Cheesy lines, antiquated CG (most video games can do much better), hyper-highly predictable. By the way, I wouldn't be surprised if the North Korean regime would cut this movie into a propaganda.

What a sham. This flik was a waste of time and money. An all star cast with a second rate plot and script. I think I could have written a better story. Boooooooooo. To think that they actually want us to believe that all 28,500 of our soldiers in Korea are at the DMZ and that Korea would be nothing without US soldiers. South Korea has more than enough soldiers, they wouldn't even miss the 28000 US soldiers. Hmmft. Hollywood is coming out with movies like our modern day commercials.

743,dimpanf,One of the worst movies I have seen in the past 2 years,1,28 June 2013,"This movie was so surprisingly terrible and disappointing after about the first 15 minutes.With characters like Morgan Freeman and Gerard Butler it definitely came to me as a surprise when this movie became from quite a disappointment, to a complete and utter failure. First off, I started questioning the movies plot and character decisions since the plane near the start flew over DC. Since when is an unauthorized plane allowed to fly that far into America before getting questioned. Where were the missiles that were supposed to be fired to shoot down the damn plane? Why were so many agents just running out of the White House, with no cover whatsoever. I could have done a better job than any of the agents being shot and I have no training whatsoever in gunfights and only a few years of judo at my side. These are just a few of the questions that popped into my head while watching this poorly directed and revised plot. However I cant blame some of the more popular characters for this movies mischief.Gerard Butler gave as good of a performance as he could have given when facing up with such a terrible plot, and Morgan Freeman was given a terrible role for the actor he is. This reminded me of the movie Red Dawn although it hasn't nearly made me as mad. God dammit Hollywood give us a good movie that involves an invasion of the United States, these make me cry myself to sleep.",Olympus Has Fallen
744,luonga93,Terrible Accuracy..,1,29 June 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it would be mediocre AT LEAST. Now that I have watched it I have completely changed my mind. I know movies aren't supposed to be completely realistic in matters regarding weapons, explosions, and military standard operating procedure...but this one was just blatantly terrible. The AC-130 that attacked DC would have been intercepted/shot down long before it made the initial pass over the city. Another point being...why would an AC- 130 gunship be that low to the ground in the first place? Don't even get me started on the aerial tracking GAU's on both sides of the aircraft either. My next point of outrage is the lack of tactical thought and security by WH security agents and the SS. It may seem romantic for some to run into bullets..but to have a stream of +20 SS agents run into an inter- locking field of fire is ridiculous. And what was up with the initial ground security? It's as if they were completely oblivious to the fact that they needed to continue to perform their duties and secure the perimeter..if they had done this more of them would have been alive instead of being shot in the back and having their perimeter breached. Another thing to bother me was the lack of hurried response from the military. I may be over-exaggerating, but it seemed as if it took military forces 15-20 minutes to respond to an attack on the WH. When a military response did organize, only U.S. Army Rangers arrived. While this would be an effective ground force to cordon of the perimeter of the WH, is this really all the US military would muster to protect the WH and The President? Seriously? Another grossly large error was the tremendously slow response time for US forces to reach the front door of the WH once it has been ""cleared."" The most annoying part of this movie was the 4-star general. Be it in a movie or in real life, any over-sized ego that orders men around recklessly is horrible and this general was no exception. After receiving actionable and valuable intel, he still pressed those 6 birds towards the WH, losing 5/6 of the helicopters and most of the platoon of SEAL's. This movie was absolutely terrible, save your time and your money. Please message me of any discrepancies or if you would like to raise a point,I have an open mind (or so I like to believe).",Olympus Has Fallen

All I have to say to that is: Fiction.The film is not supposed to be realistic, it is a work of fiction so get off your high horse, sit back and enjoy the story. I thought the film was excellent. It contained various 'Die Hard' aspects but the film was focusing around terrorism and the White House being taken over. Gerard Butler was brilliant as usual, very good at playing the wronged Secret Service agent back to redeem himself. Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart were both also brilliant as I have long thought they were.The film was shot with amazing cinematography and epic symbolism (especially when Gerard Butler's character Mike Banning kills one of the North Korean terrorists in the Oval Office with a bust of Lincoln). I was enraptured in the film for the entire 120 minutes and I strongly recommend anyone who enjoys a good political action/thriller to give it a go!

With 7+ rating and the presence great actors like Morgan Freeman what more could I have expected? Well as it turns out a better plot line, a little bit of research on how the secret service agents would react to a plane shooting at them (I know nothing about any police or secret service protocols, but seriously would you in your right mind shoot at a flying plane with anti-personnel rifles??), perhaps a bit of research on how the leaders of U.S.A would really react to a similar situation as portrayed in the movie (I mean president > tens of millions of life + a possible WWIII? - hmm not so sure if you ask me...), oh and this is something more personal (as a Korean) but why would a North Korean terrorist say ""The Sea of Japan"" instead of the ""East Sea"" - this one's a bit silly, but details like these really decreased the quality of this film. Despite the points made above I give this film a 2 just because it was hilarious in nature. Agents ""trained"" to guard the president of one of the super powers now a days walking into bullets, 40 paramilitary terrorists being able to walk unharmed into the White House in 13 minutes and 12 of these terrorists with ""super bullets"" that pierce through everything assassinated by erm... 1 ex-agent with codes that do not get changed for 18 months... Honestly the it was simply overwhelming the amount of negative emotion the movie conveyed. People cheering when the president was rescued somehow forgetting about the dozens of men including the vice president that died moments earlier, people killed by this mastermind North Korean that somehow became the security detail of the Korean prime minister and leaders that do not pull their people back until 5/6 choppers are completely destroyed.This movie has some Die hard thingy going on for those block buster fans but for that matter there are far better movies of this genre.Bottom line, if you want to laugh and enjoy of the incompetence of Antoine Fuqua (who by the way had made great films in the past) watch the movie. If not don't waste 2 hours of your lives as I did.P.S for the movie developers: Next time please get people that actually CAN speak Korean please. How hard can it possibly be?",Olympus Has Fallen

758,Robertdschneider,Best action film in 25 years,10,13 August 2013,"I have been waiting for this movie for a long time. Since 1988 when I sat in a packed theater and watched the original Die Hard with a room full of screaming people, I have longed for an action movie that had the same adrenaline rush and unrelenting tempo of that film. Ironically Olympus Has Fallen follows almost the same plot structure as Die Hard only this time the setting is the White House instead of a skyscraper. A two hour film has never flown by so quickly. The pacing is perfect, the action set pieces are jaw dropping, and if you are watching on blu-ray in a good home theater the DTS-MA soundtrack is one of the best I've experienced. If you ignore some of the basic story implausibilities and just kick back and enjoy this thing you are in for the ride of your movie-going life. Regarding other reviewers comments on how this could never happen and how ludicrous it is let's all remember that if a film had come out concerning the events of 9-11 before that occurred no one would have believed that possible either. Even if you are not patriotic by nature you will be running around your living room waving the Stars and Stripes by the time the end credits roll!",Olympus Has Fallen
759,shawn_carney,An overall excellent action packed movie,10,14 August 2013,"I read the reviews for this movie before I watched it, and even though most of the reviews that I read said that this was a bad movie because it was over the top and had cut-out stereotypical characters, I still thought it was a great action packed movie and was on par with The Die Hard series or even The Expendables. To say that this was a bad movie because it's unrealistic is to say that the action genre as a whole is terrible because most action movies are unrealistic, but they're still fun to watch. For the people that gave this movie a bad rating, you may as well give movies like G.I. Joe, X-Men, and Transformers bad ratings as well. That's just my opinion, and I welcome yours. If you're looking for a good time and enjoy action, spend the $1.50 and get this at Red Box. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",Olympus Has Fallen

You say that you are not in the mood to watch ""Die Hard"" again for the umpteenth time? I feel that way too, but nevertheless I would have been more satisfied watching ""Die Hard"" again than having spent 120 minutes of my life on this picture. This is one of those movies that made me writhe in disgust and contempt. I kept thinking how inviting the ""eject"" button on my blu-ray remote looked. I almost quit before the end.

I will not name the book because I encourage everyone to read his work. This is the latest trend of Hollywood to produce movies based on novels without having to give credit or receive input from the talented writers who came up with the concept. Hollywood is void of talent and has resorted to downright theft of other peoples talent. Other authors such as Brad Thor and Stephen Hunter have multiple books that should be made into movies with the input of the author. Stephen Hunter had one success with Mark Wahlberg starring but Hollywood still took liberty in changing the story. Hollywood wonders why they are in trouble. I have not named the books on purpose.

There are a lot of people out there that would find this movie disgusting and unnecessary, but if you can handle the intense blood baths, there still isn't a lot left to fulfill...Putting the pointless back-story aside, the opening of the film may hold your attention for a good bit. However, once it dies down, the plot turns into nothing more than a dragged out Die Hard with hit-or-miss humor(Or Die Another Day without Pierce... Or The Fugitive with Freeman replacing Tommy Lee Jones and an over-the-top premise). Speaking of Morgan, Freeman fans won't get their fix. Butler and Eckhart justly express their talents, but in the end are buzz-killed due to insufficient drive. At times it had an original feel, one of its attempted strongholds.

It is so far from reality that its simply hard to sit through. I can't imagine any Secret Service agent could do so as it simply makes them appear to be blithering idiots. I'm unsure what makes some actors take these rolls other than the paycheck.

You will be on the edge of your seat. Gerald Butler's acting is top notch as well as many of the other actors. Melissa Leo as the Secretary of Defense, while her part was small she gave a very captivation performance. There is some strong language, which is to be expected seeing as how the movie is rated R.

765,jeffcampbell333,Disappointed,3,28 August 2013,"What I wrote immediately on my Facebook wall upon seeing this movie: ""Did I miss something, or are cheesy '90's movies back? Olympus Has Fallen=Waste of my Redbox budget."" I think that's a pretty fair assessment. The presented scenarios were ridiculous, the President's character was poorly written, and highly unrealistic, not to mention the corny blech that oozed from the screen. I'll be honest, I am often attracted to R rated movies because they tend to portray a more realistic world. This flick failed realism, which is why I disliked it.First off, there's the blatant disregard for the intelligence community. We're supposed to believe that a group of men, one an x-secret service agent, can pose as security for a South Korean Prime Minister while secretly being part of a terrorist organization? My God, they have a picture of the guy when they mention his name in the movie! No, no, it's okay. I get it. You have a picture of the guy... but no security agency, in two countries, notice a damn thing. I doubt it.Solid action... nothing based on anything that could ever actually happen. They were looking for ""thought provoking"" or at the very least ""plausible"" but missed on all accounts. If I'm going to pay for a political thriller, I want some fact, some well thought out plot, something that shows holes in the system, not a cheesy feel good flick based on an impossible scenario. Good action, good acting... terrible writing. My hell, ""The Dictator"" has a more plausible story line than this movie!",Olympus Has Fallen
766,yoopyp,Get the facts right!,1,28 August 2013,"Okay. To be clear, I did not hate the movie. The movie itself was actually quite fun to watch. However, the only reason I am giving 1 star is that there were two facts that were awfully misleading. First, no Korean would EVER say the words, ""Sea of Japan."" Koreans have their own term called, ""East Sea."" Especially America hating North Koreans will not use the term, ""Sea of Japan,"" as they hate Japan as much as they hate the U.S. The actor, Rick Yune, who played the villain is known to hate the Korean culture and his Korean is not that good either (not that anyone cares). I do not know why he does not care for the Korean culture as he is an ABK. If he really knew his stuff, he would have told the director the simple fact about East Sea. Secondly, the military general guy said that if the US pulled the fleets away from East Sea, they would take over Seoul within 72 hours. OK, this is quite dumb. Really, it's stupid. South Korea has its own army, too, which may not seem much for the global super power like the US, but the fire power in South Korea is not that weak. It would take a lot longer than 72 hours. Why do they think all the Korean young men spend 2 years of their lives serving for their country?

The actors are top notch, all the action scenes were well done but it was too much in your face type stuff. One of the best movies to feature the president and military action was 'Seven Days in May"", not the same type of movie though. My point is that without shooting, explosions, CGI and hand to hand combat in almost every scene it was a GREAT movie. With this movie they forgot about all the things that makes a great movie what it is and replaced it with video game action and lack of plot development.

Was prepared for another medium key movie but was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie kept me interest right through. Acting was good and Morgan Freeman as always gives a good performance. Movie is fairly long but well worth hanging in to the end sequence which had a good twist. On average would recommend this movie for anyone who is in the mood to watch a good action flick.

This one would qualify to be called a Z film. It is so bad. From the directing to the cinematography and the acting it is one of those rotten tomatoes that make you cringe in your seat, walk out in the middle and demand a refund.I simply cannot understand how it has managed to get a 6 star average. Who are the people that have given this rating? Have they even seen films before? The cinematography and acting, which clearly come from the director's management of the project, is so bad. I was unable to put myself in the characters position because everything feels fake and for some unexplained reason there is nothing you truly feel you can identify with them so the film runs smoothly. You basically feel like a bunch of inexperienced high school kids with too much money at hand is trying to make a motion picture.So, because the movie was such a Turkey I just had to look up the name of the director so I don't waste another 2 hours of my life again on any work by these two.And lo and behold. The director is some Antoine Fuqua who has never really done a quality film in his entire career. Antoine Fuqua has done films like Shooter, King Arthur, Lightning in a Bottle, Tears of the Sun, Training Day, From Toni with Love: The Video Collection, Bait. Apart from Training Day, have you even heard of any of them? Me neither. And Training Day was such a dark, depressing and negative film leaving you miserable and angry afterwards that you wondered what twisted psychology was behind a film like that. Well now I know. It was the psychology of Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua has also made Brooklyn's Finest, another one star scheise that also feels discoordinated and where the actors are out of place; a truly poor quality film.Fuqua's movies always feel like such a grotesque distortion of reality that it is very difficult to feel any familiarity at all with any of his characters. You can tell that the actors don't feel any familiarity either, because whenever anyone half a name act in Antoine Fuqua's film, their acting goes down the toilette and they look like they need to take a five year course at The Actors Studio or some other professional place.It's therefore interesting to note that Antoine Fuqua is African American. If this discoordinated, dark and distorted world is the mind of African American males in general, no wonder so many fall behind in society. I'm certainly not going to pretend this guy has any talent at all, which he doesn't, merely for his complexion. He should get the same critique as anyone else. In all sincerity he should go back to film school. Seriously.It's because of films like this the illegal download market came into being.",Olympus Has Fallen

If you don't use logic then sure there are none. But if you use just a tiny portion of your brain then suddenly the plot holes are ridiculously obvious.The characters are for the most part unbelievable one dimensioned. I don't mind this so much in an action movie but this sets up a tone where they want to be taken seriously.SPOILERS! READ NO FURTHER! SPOILERS!Plothole 1: Why would you make a system that can blow up the nukes without firing them? The whole point of the system was to make sure that if one was fired accidentally then it could be aborted. Plothole 2: The president tries to spare the other two code-holders from torture by letting them give up the codes. But that is simply idiotic. The guy torturing them could just continue to torture them when they wanted the Presidents code. At best he has postponed their torture. At worst he has doomed his own country.

The plot is just insanely dumb: ""Terrorists"" (in this case North Koreans) ""flood"" into the US and actually attack the White House! Okay...let that settle for a second and then let's move on to just some of the crazy parts:A US military plane flies over Washington DC and is first asked to identify itself only about 30 seconds away from the White House.-After the plane shoots up the White House about 40 North Koreans start attacking, they were just waiting outside disguised as tourists and they actually get out RPGs, machine guns, et cetera...So we are to believe that about 40 North Korean Paramilitary Fighters entered the US undetected, bought or brought an arsenal of Rocket Launchers, Machine Guns, and much other war equipment, carried it in front of the White House undetected and start attacking it.Of course the Police, Tactical Response Teams, Secret Service heck not even the Navy Seals stand a chance against them....As another reviewer already remarked, and I agree: If this movie had ""Die Hard 5"" written on it I would be more inclined to like it. It would still be a stupid story, but that's the idea of Die Hard, it only has to get you so far to get the action started. However this movie is trying to come across as serious - at least I could not see any hint to believe otherwise - so it's just unacceptable.

Cast, acting, premise, direction, action sequences, s/fx, all good enough for your standard action/political drama.The script, the dialogue, the logical flaws, the poor decision making of the ""hero"" characters were all insurmountable obstacles to enjoying this movie. It was the first movie in a long long time where I began screaming at the television.This is my first IMDb review, and I write it to save other people their time.I enjoy a good action flick (i.e. Die Hard was great). I enjoy a good political drama action flick (i.e. Air Force One was great). I enjoy that style of movie for what they are. Olympus Has Fallen was a black abyss of despair.Spoilers start here: There are so many things to point to in this to illustrate my point. However, I will start with my biggest problem with this movie.The President of the United States, his cabinet, the Speaker of the House and the Pentagon team made consistently awful, stupid and dangerous decisions, jeopardizing, at a minimum, 350 million people to save maybe 10 people.I believe in the suspension of disbelief while watching a fictional movie, but sometimes the flaws are so blatant that they shock you out of such suspension. Such was the case in this despicable movie.The writer of this film thought that it would make the President look tough and Presidential to beg for other peoples lives while saying that they would not get the secret code that he had memorized (the terrorist objective). This had the exact opposite effect. He looked weak and like someone that I would never want to have as President, because we would all die (and we almost did in this movie - directly as a result of his poor decision making process).For instance, one scene has the chief terrorist threaten to kill the Joint Chief of Staff(JCOS) in order to obtain the code that the JCOS has memorized. POTUS tells JCOS ""Give him the code. He won't get mine!"" So much here: 1. Long time decorated military general JCOS approx. 60-70 yrs. old rolls right over and to save his own life and follow POTUS's order gives the code; 2. POTUS shows he'll act against state interest to save an individual life, what prevents the terrorist from threatening JCOS a second time in order to secure the POTUS code.Anyway, I could go on for the length of the movie (approx. 2 hrs) about the terrible flaws in this movie. Flaws so distracting they made me angry and yanked me out of the suspension of disbelief.",Olympus Has Fallen
785,jimmy-nijlant,not the best film ever,7,24 November 2013,"If I was a critic I would have written this movie off. Saying that its just one of those movies with the same old plot with a bit modification. This is true, but as an audience I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.The best thing about this movie is its pace. You won't know how fast the 110 minutes go. There's not a minute you feel bored. The attack sequences are bit over the top, but if you are a drama lover, you won't be disappointed. The storyline isn't much to think about but the screenplay is apt. Its a good thing that the director Antonie Fuqua keeps things simple, doesn't dig too much into the conspiracy stuff and also doesn't include any unnecessary twists.Gerard Butler does what he does best, fight bad guys. Aaron Eckhart as the stern faced president reminds you of Harvey Dent. Morgan Freeman probably is there to strengthen the star value in the film. But its the villain Rick Yune with his evil smile who impresses.This is an out and out entertainer, don't think too much, just be in the moment and watch this movie.",Olympus Has Fallen
786,abrie-4,The most ridiculous plot ever?,4,30 August 2013,"I love a mindless action movie as much as the next guy, and really have no problem suspending my disbelief for most of them. But really? This movie has such a ridiculous plot-line it is beyond laughable. Some movies need 1 or 2 implausible events to set the stage, but then at least the rest of the movie is believable enough. But not here. They just add one ridiculous plot event/decision on top of another until you can only conclude that there was undoubtedly no-one with any power of reason involved in the making of it.If you want to just see some (fairly good) action sequences and can stomach seeing the people in charge of a country make one nonsensical, idiotic decision after the other, (and of course a few mandatory superficial emotional scenes/monologues thrown in), then watch it, but you can really do a lot better.I give it 4 points for some decent action sequences and the fact that in spite of the script and direction the actors actually manage to make you believe that their characters are real.",Olympus Has Fallen

Then the my Savior's name was used in dishonor. Conscience can't let me watch anymore. So frustrating because I was really getting into it. Graphics were great. Very suspenseful. When will these directors and actors start respecting that there is a large percentage of the public that WILL NOT drop money at the box office because they can't show a little decency and respect. Huge population here that is limited to animated children's entertainment because we won't sacrifice our respect to our Lord just for temporary entertainment. Want to make more money?

788,jablanchard95,Good Movie for What it Is,8,16 December 2013,"Here I am on the IMDb site reading all of these negative reviews about Olympus Has Fallen, and my question is: ""Why see a movie (and write a severely negative review on it after-wards) if you can tell the entire genre and plot from the trailers?""To get started, we've got an action flick involving Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman, and Aaron Eckhart (to name a few) who star in a movie about North Korean terrorists taking over the White House. Follow up the take-over with Butler moving through the place cleaning house single- handedly. To give some predictions that we could guess: 1. The bad guy leader dies, 2. Butler bleeds a little bit, but still comes out on top, and 3. The President is okay in the end, albeit hurt some.To review the actual movie, it was - as some people have pointed out - a Die Hard clone, and a good one at that. The CGI is a little fake looking in some parts (primarily the C-130 attack and the helicopters crashing sequence), but the hand-to-hand sequences between Butler and the North Korean commandos looks good. It's fast, tight, and brutal, which is what equates to ""good"" hand-to-hand these days.The gun play is over-exaggerated in that ""good guys can't hit anything until the script calls for it, and the star is a dead-eye with every bullet"", but beyond that, the fighting between good and bad is great for an action movie.The plot itself contained a few holes, and as has been pointed out, significantly the President's code's magical acquisition by the terrorists after he swore to his staff that, ""They won't get it from me.""Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Olympus Has Fallen, and would suggest it to anyone who is interested in a good action flick.",Olympus Has Fallen
789,gelz24,This was the worst movie I have ever seen.,1,30 December 2013,"I've never felt compelled to write a review before, but when I saw that this movie had received a 6.5 rating, I had to.The whole time I was watching this film (and I honestly can't believe I made it through to the end) my head was swimming with questions. Like...where is the Vice President through all of this? Why is the US military suddenly no match for 30-odd militants? How did that plane even get to DC in the first place, and where did all of the on-the-ground militants come from? Honestly this movie makes no sense. What's worse is it's politically incorrect (bordering on extremely racist) and really poorly written. The script is absolutely terrible, and I usually don't mind bad language in movies at all, but the amount of times the F-Bomb is dropped in totally inappropriate and random settings makes the script campy and crass. My number one issue though, is why are these people even questioning that the president's life is worth the lives of potentially millions of South Koreans? As if anyone in government would even consider that a worthwhile trade? Horrible. So unrealistic I couldn't even begin to take it seriously.Honestly, don't waste your time with this horrible film. The plot is filled with holes and I was almost embarrassed...I hope people who are not from the US don't watch this film (not sure why they would) because I would hate for anyone to think that this is how Americans think. I want the last two hours of my life back!",Olympus Has Fallen

791,jdi1279,Great Movie With Flaws,8,12 February 2014,"People seem to complain about how this movie has so many flaws relating to the realism, or lack thereof. It is a movie and it is for entertainment. If you start watching a movie expecting it to be as close to real as possible, you will end up not liking said movie. With that said, I REALLY enjoyed this film. I have never seen a movie with Morgan Freeman I did not like and this one is no exception. Some of the quotes in the film are cheesy and that is OK. the character build was not the greatest, but you get to know them well enough to know where the film is going and to keep you engrossed. The plot was somewhat cliché when it comes to an action/thriller movie. However, for me, it stands out as one of the better ones pulled off. When I watch an action film I like to see action and not a lot of mush between the love interest of the main actors. I know there needs to be some to build the character and some movies go way overboard and sacrifice a lot of action and I do not like that. This film, even though it had some ""mushy"" parts to it, it was kept to a minimum which made room for more action scenes. I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Mostly for the actors who played their rolls well. Morgan Freeman, as always, did a wonderful job, as did the rest. I did not give it a 10 because these types of plots are a dime a dozen and they are just rehashed over and over again. I did enjoy the movie and I recommend it to anyone.",Olympus Has Fallen
792,taylor-krukar,Olympus Has Fallen-Great Movie,8,17 February 2014,"Action, drama, and suspense: three things that many types of movie lovers search out when they're deciding what to see in the theaters. Olympus Has Fallen, directed by Antoine Fuqua, delivers on all three of these fronts. Gerard Butler stars as Mike Banning, a Secret Service agent who after an accident involving the President (Aaron Eckhart) and the First Lady (Ashley Judd), is demoted from the head of the President's security to a menial desk job at the Treasury Department. Following a terrorist attack on the White House, Banning must try and help put an end to the invasion and rescue the President while the Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) takes over as acting President. With non-stop action from start to finish, Olympus Has Fallen delivers on its promises of being a first-rate action thriller. This movie will have you on your toes from beginning to end and the plot will have you constantly wondering what's going to happen next and what Banning's next move will be. Butler delivers as he always does and plays his usual action hero role. Although his acting skills can be somewhat limited to this type of performance, he never fails to play it with ease. With amazing nonverbal cues during the most intense scenes in the movie, Butler aces this portrayal.Aaron Eckhart's ability to take on all characteristics of what a President should be like allows him to make this a flawless and very believable performance. Morgan Freeman's finesse and skills as an actor completely show through in this movie. He definitely brings about a sense of authority and power with his commanding presence as the Speaker of the House in this performance. Although this type of plot has been used in movies before and is not the most original idea, Olympus Has Fallen manages to make you feel as if you've never seen something like it. The graphics and effects, although a bit over the top and exaggerated, are fitting for this type of movie in that they are supposed to be a bit extreme. The script is very well written and captures all of the necessary aspects that you would look for in a suspenseful action thriller like this. All of the characters lines help support the plot and make it realistic and conceivable. This movie flows seamlessly and there are little to no gaps in the story line that make you wonder what could possibly be happening at that time. The series of events in the plot of Olympus Has Fallen make it so that all of the scenes jump from one to the next without any issues or confusion.This plot and script of this movie are sure to invoke a sense of patriotism towards the United States as a whole. It is nearly impossible to not feel an extreme sense of nationalism and pride towards our county after watching this film. Seeing the White House, a place of reverence for United States citizens, being put under attack by foreign terrorists is likely to make everyone want to show unity as a country. Olympus Has Fallen is a movie with the ability to intrigue its viewers consistently throughout its two-hour run time. The parts and pieces all fit together to make an amazing film.",Olympus Has Fallen

794,diogosalazar83,Awful movie,1,13 March 2014,"Where to begin? 1,000 are not enough to say how bad this movie is. Apparently Washington D.C and the White House are the easiest places to be breeched. Also, the south Korean intelligence agencies are run by an inbred, drooling, moronic idiot who likes to eat his own poo, given the fact that the whole security detachment was made up of north Korean terrorists. Morgan Freeman is firstly shown up as a tough congressman who tells the president that he should tell the north Koreans to frag themselves, when asked what to do if they call our bluff, he responds: ""who says we are bluffing?"" then, a few hours later he gives EVERYTHING the terrorists asked of him.This is how it should have happened:Kang: ""I want you to retreat the 7th fleet and your troops from the DMZ, or else I'll kill everyone in here."" (this, right after he murdered the south Korean prime minister in cold blood before saying anything)Acting President Trumbull: ""And I want you to surrender all your henchmen and leave all the American citizens held hostage alive or else I'll request tactical nuclear missiles to be dropped on Pyongyang.""Also, whoever designed the software of the Cerberus should be executed after this. How the hell you design a system that is supposed to self-destruct nuclear missiles after they are launched but work just as fine if used even if they are not launched?

No compare for Gerard Butler in this movie. This is a must watch movie for all. For US this should be in everyone mind that by any means we should protect our laws and no place for the terrorists. I like the movie so much for its thrilling experience. When i suggested my friends to watch this movie they all enjoyed it so much. Man i just loved it to watch again and again. I love you Butler. When the film's main action start, the film doesn't stop running. The bad guys, oh boy they do mean business. Americans citizens get mowed down by bullets from ground and air forces. The all-American (Scottish) hero represents freedom and justice, and the bad guys represent every American's worst nightmare.Having said that, Rick Yune surprisingly makes for an effective and nasty villain, who is relentlessly cold, smug and procedural in his mission, following the formula perfectly.

798,Remo-Williams,Return of the Definitive Old School Action Extravaganza,10,29 March 2013,"Much like a particular hard-boiled New York detective from the Eighties and a certain Navy SEAL cook from the Nineties, ex-Secret Service agent Mike Banning is about to have a very bad day. Luckily, this bad day is a real audience pleaser. In this moment in time, when films like ""The Expendables"" 1 and 2, ""Bullet to the Head,"" ""The Last Stand,"" and ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" are all vying for that nostalgic Eighties/early Nineties trip down action memory lane, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" wins over them all, completely taking the prize as the true meat and potatoes throwback to Regan-era extravaganzas that action junkies have been waiting for. I had the pleasure of doing coverage for this script ten years ago, while I was interning at a production company in Los Angeles. Fortunately, they kept the title. It always had the right ring to it. I am happy to say that the finished product, which I had the unique pleasure of viewing with the film's talented writers, Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt, is the same action ride that I read on paper a decade ago. It's refreshing to see writers Creighton and Katrin coming up with scenarios that are simply meant to impress the audience and take them on a ride. I am reminded of that moment when our wisecracking hero, Banning (Gerard Butler, back in pitch-perfect tough guy mode), has to go to the roof of the White House and destroy an out-of-control missile defense system. Seeing that type of adventurous scenario on the big screen again made me giddy and nostalgic. I love those moments, and I love these movies. In the age of PG-13 and/or watered-down-R action pictures, not to mention films that are entirely too short (""Die Hard 5,"" anyone?), the R-rated ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" which runs at a pleasing two hours, is the definitive Guy's Action Popcorn Movie (thankfully not released on Valentine's Day), a throwback to the age of the fun ride. The White House has become a war zone after an amazing all-out assault by North Korean baddies (we're talking James Cameron-eque, ""Black Hawk Down"" technical precision and attention to detail. Kudos to director Antoine Fuqua). Modern audiences will be happy with camera choices that occasionally give us first-person-shooter scenarios. I loved the various scenes of hand-to-hand combat, as well as Banning's unapologetic view about getting the job done (look no further than his interrogation methods). In a nod to Schwarzenegger/Seagal-esque violence, one particularly vulgar and aggressive back and forth banter with main baddie Rick Yune is darkly funny and warranted, and a mid-point moment involving a bust of Lincoln is a literal knockout. The White House geography also is used well to appropriately brutal effect. There are moments where the lighting is similar to director/cinematographer Peter Hyams films (""Sudden Death,"" ""The Relic""), movies that play with darkness and shadows and revel in them. Thus, in many instances, our hero, dressed in black (naturally cut from the same unstoppable cloth as one Mr. Seagal), emerges from the dark to dispense justice, and he could be lurking anywhere. One particular scene, as Banning walks down a hallway, gun pointed, illuminated only by a hanging halogen light, will remind you of the era of then-cinematographer Jan de Bont's ""The Hunt for Red October.""Although released in this uncertain and grim post-9/11 era, when there is necessary discussion about gun control (and I am very in favor of the idea), the film, with its gruesome, unapologetic action, frankly has the right tone that a throwback action movie needs. That night in the theater, I got my action movie fix. ""Olympus Has Fallen"" will be a definite Blu-ray purchase for me. I look forward to watching that White House assault scene again with my theater surround system. I congratulate Mr. Rothenberger and Ms. Benedikt on their first produced effort. Enjoy the ride and watch as Banning saves the day with the old-school attitude that takes a well deserved break from PG-13. Highly recommended.",Olympus Has Fallen

801,kknetzger-11774,Olympus Has Fallen Movie Review,10,4 October 2016,"Although I am not knowledgeable on the work of directors, I would recommend any of Antoine Fuqua's action thriller movies just after seeing Olympus Has Fallen. With a stellar star lineup, special effects production, and a plot that screams patriotism, this movie was bound to be a success. The star of the movie, Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler, is a former Presidential Secret Service agent who finds himself in a sticky situation; he must take control of the White House national security team, once again, during a terrorist attack. Alone and under attack, he must save not only the President and his colleagues, but the entire nation itself from terrorist takeover. Being a former agent, he has the required skills and knowledge of the White House that makes him the perfect man for the job. The role of speaker of the house was ironically played by Morgan Freeman, a man known for his voice. It was not one of his more interesting roles, but Freeman uses his serious tone of voice to make even the smallest role seem meaningful. Being put in the position to take control of the situation while the President is unable to, I awaited to hear every drastic decision he made that brought changes in the plot. The dynamic relationship between Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart, the President, is not what you would expect it to be. The relationship of security guard and President is stripped down onto a more personal level of two friends who care about each other as people, not just the position they take in the government. The interaction we are first introduced to in the beginning is playful; like they have been lifelong buddies who can take a joke or two. This was a refreshing and unexpected surprise because you don't often see this sort of interaction in action movie's, especially between two male actors. Although the plot seems to be implausible, the special effects take full responsibility for providing realistic Hollywood drama. The explosions were loud like they were in the same room as you, weapons were realistic, and camera work was steady making it easy to lose yourself in the movie and seem realistic. Gerard Butler seemed to prepare well because he looked badass in every fight scene handling weapons and fighting a whole army of terrorists all on his own; His masculinity just oozes from the screen. The writer did a phenomenal job playing on sympathy to get you to really feel the movie. Giving the President a young son and taking away his wife in a tragic car accident makes your heart ache for him as he goes through hell and back being tortured. This is a smart tactic in an action film because now you are emotionally invested in the plot and feel a need to continue watching. Being citizens of the United States also gives you an emotional connection to the plot and adds to the fury you feel towards the terrorists for destroying your country. Sometimes, all action thriller movies seem to fall under the same category and are produced too similarly with predictability. Olympus has fallen just doesn't seem to follow that same line; Antoine Fuqua and his special effects team create a powerful visual experience that is sure to satisfy, and an unpredictable plot that will spark so many different emotions you will just be left in awe.",Olympus Has Fallen
802,vamsisv,Impossible scenarios even for this movie genre and plot loopholes,6,29 March 2013,"10/10 for Butler. No questions asked.But the movie fails with so many loopholes and IMPOSSIBLE scenarios. Extremely stupid that terrorists just storm into White house with ZERO resistance from the Army, SS or local cops.Here is the mega goof-up. The President ""orders"" the first two (Admiral & Defense secretary) to give up those codes because he is confident that they can never break him to get the 3rd code. But towards the end of the movie, you realize that they somehow get the 3rd code and activate some destruction sequence. Duh! How did that happen. I'm sure I didn't fall asleep.Then there is the traitor SS agent and all he had to say for his acts was that he didn't vote for the president. Okayyyy!There were moments of chuckles in the theaters some genuine but most in utter disbelief of the stupidity going on the screen.Morgan freeman's cannot be more clichéd. What's with ordering coffee when he has to decide whether to agree to the terrorists' demands or not.Your call, people.",Olympus Has Fallen
