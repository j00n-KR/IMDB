0,Leofwine_draca,An old-fashioned Christmas monster story,6,27 December 2017,"KRAMPUS is a high-spirited Christmas horror tale that's a lot more fun than most Christmas-themed horrors which seem to go down the predictable 'killer Santa Claus' route. This one has some of the style and verve of the fine Halloween anthology TRICK 'R TREAT, and, although not as good as that movie, it tends to be better than average overall. The small-scale story is a little like POLTERGEIST and GREMLINS and involves a festive family gathering which is invaded by a series of crazy monsters brought to life by the spirit of German folklore. The family members end up getting munched and attacked by sentient toys and Christmas decorations, and if it's all a little safe and PG-13, there's enough high-spirited mayhem and decent FX work to let you forget the simplicity and occasional silliness of the story.",Krampus
1,SnoopyStyle,this should be more vicious,5,31 October 2016,"Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette) are trying to have the perfect Christmas with their children Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen), Max (Emjay Anthony), and Tom's German-speaking mother Omi (Krista Stadler). The problem is that they are being joined by Sarah's sister Linda (Allison Tolman) and her horrible family. Linda has her husband Howard (David Koechner), their kids Stevie (Lolo Owen), Jordan (Queenie Samuel), Howie Jr. (Maverick Flack), and baby Chrissy. Worse of all, Linda brings their aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). The situation takes the ugliest turn when Stevie steals Max's letter to Santa and reads it out loud. Max tears up the letter and renounces Christmas thereby allowing Krampus into their lives.The setup is great. There is a solid cast of actors. They are adapt at both comedy and horror. This movie is set to launch. However, it never truly achieves escape velocity. It is constrained by certain gravitational pulls. The obvious one is that Max should be the lead character. An extension is that his sister Beth should not be the first to go. The adult actors are all great but they should be the first to go. With only kids, the tension is ratcheted higher and it would keep Max as the lead.Second is the level of horror. The old style where the kids disappear rather than be grotesquely killed does not get over the hump. The movie tries to be irreverent gore but ends up being light B-movie romp. This should be more vicious. I also have a lighting issue. Candle light and fire light is often not enough. Overall, this concept holds great promise but this movie aims for less.",Krampus
2,Horst_In_Translation,I did not expect too much and I pretty much got what I expected,4,13 December 2017,"""Krampus"" is an American 95-minute movie from 2015 and if you have heard the name Krampus before and remember the reference, then maybe you will know that here we have a combination of Christmas and horror, in which the scary component, however, is far more dominant than the harmonic component. The director is Michael Dougherty and he is also one of the many writers working on this one. The most known cast members here are certainly Oscar nominee Toni Collette and Adam Scott from Parks and Recreation. I cannot deny that I am not a fan of the latter at all, also in this film, but it needs to be said in his excuse that honestly the material he and most of the other cast members were given here is never that amazing at all. There are also several child performers in here, who are probably not known to many and for me personally, that also includes the kid at the center of the story. The character of Krampus was included in many other horror films already, but this has to be among his most famous inclusions, probably even the number one. We see him in all kinds of shapes and costumes here and my favorite was probably the harlequin skin if you may want to call it that.But besides that, I also felt sadly that most of the movie was really forgettable. The general idea about the summoning and the background story of the creature not only never had me on the edge of the seat, but never impressed me at all. It's pretty tough to find huge pros in here. I think the runtime was not (way) too long. The ending when it actually seems they kill the boy was bold and unexpected, but sadly they made up for that kind of quality quickly afterward by including a stupid ""oh it was all just a dream"" story line. I also did not find this one worth seeing from the Christmas film perspective. The only ones I'd really recommend it to are probably those who really really are into supernatural creature horror films although they probably have seen it anyway already. The ending indicates that there may be plans for a sequel (or prequel), but we will see about that. I am not sure if quality, critical reception and especially box office were successful enough for them to really go for it. All in all, my personal verdict here is rather on the negative side too. Gotta give this one a thumbs-down and it is clearly inferior to some recent fairly decent horror films I've seen in previous months. My suggestion is you watch something else as this one clearly tries to include effects (even animation in flashback sequences) to make up for story-telling deficits. It's not worth your time.",Krampus
3,Prismark10,Gingerbread on fire,4,12 November 2016,"Krampus is a mild Christmas horror film for all the family but I am not sure it succeeds with an opening which is too family friendly with an extended family that reminded me of the Home Alone movies before it takes a darker turn.Krampus opens with a dig at the commercialisation of Christmas as people harry for the latest gifts in a store.Max (Emjay Anthony) is a young boy who still believes in the spirit of Christmas however when his family is joined by his uncouth, gun loving uncle, aunt and cousins his enjoyment is spoilt especially as they lead out aloud at the dinner table his letter to Santa.Humiliated Max rips up the letter and throws it to the wind but soon afterwards a blizzard appears, there is a power cut in town. Before long creepy, snowmen appear, demonic dolls come alive, fiery gingerbread men attack and elves start to rampage leading to the emergence of the big bad Krampus.Max's Austrian Grandma tells the tale of the legendary Krampus, a character from European folklore who is some kind of an evil opposite of Saint Nicholas who comes to punish, not reward. She encountered him when she was a little girl.Krampus lacks the balance between mischievous humour and the comedy horror of Gremlins which lets it down. It also does not follow through with the satire that is signalled in its opening and is too sloppily paced but you can still watch it as a family if you are looking for a less saccharine festive film.",Krampus
4,nogodnomasters,HE HAS COME FOR US ALL,8,17 April 2018,"The film opens showing us that Christmas is a holiday of aggression at the Mucho Mart. Tom Engel (Adama Scott) and family are hosting some relatives for the holiday season, people they seem to tolerate only because they are family. Howard (David Koechner) is a citizen with the right to bear arms and makes no bones about it with his family that ""crawled out of the shallow end of the gene pool."" Young Max Engel (Emjay Anthony) has a special relationship with his German grandmother (Krista Stadler) who believes in Santa. When Max is bullied...the spirit of things change.It took me a while to see this film because of the plethora of Krampus films on the market. This one is ""kid friendly"" in that there are no F-words, sex, nudity, or gross bloody scenes. I don't see it as an annual classic as it is a film one can out grow. The production had a ""Gremlins"" feel to it as small characters provide us with mischief. The film lacks real horror for adults. Fair amount of humor.",Krampus
5,kosmasp,Horror Mystery,7,30 April 2016,"Or is it fable? It's tough to decide. And it's even tougher for some to call this Horror since so many good actors are involved with this. Toni Collette to name but one. No one would think of her in a Horror movie. And yet here she is and I'm pretty sure she liked the no holds barred script that while it's silly at times, also has some very strong ideas throughout.The child actors are really good too and the movie could've been just another Christmas movie with Comedy themes. Think of unwanted family members coming over and a feast that has more insults than love spreading around the table. So while this is Horror fantasy, you also have a lot of comedy and other ingredients that either make you excited about that ""meal"" or they make you want to get out as fast as possible ... Which actually wouldn't have been a bad idea for the characters in this case ...",Krampus
6,gavin6942,An Uneven Disappointment,6,16 May 2016,"A boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a Christmas demon to his family home.I like Michael Dougherty. ""Trick r Treat"" is a modern masterpiece, and he happens to be a heck of a nice guy. Even here, there were so many good ideas, that I hate to be overly harsh on the film. But it came out uneven, a bit slow in places, and I was never quite sure if it was horror or comedy. The two did not blend quite right.I would have liked to see more from the elves and maybe less from the other creatures. Some of them seemed oddly reminiscent to ""Gingerdead Man"" and ""Demonic Toys"", and it is never a good idea to give Charlie Band something to claim he had an influence on.",Krampus
7,lee_eisenberg,it's beginning to feel a lot like terror,9,7 May 2016,"Every Christmas, a bunch of treacly movies get released, ostensibly to get people in the spirit but actually to make money. That's why Michael Dougherty's ""Krampus"" is so fun. In addition to trashing the overly sugary Christmas movies, it also pokes fun at consumerism. The opening scene shows a bunch of people pouring into a supermarket to grab the latest whatever. Black Friday has to be one of the more ironic days of the year: on Thanksgiving people give thanks for what they have, and the very next day they scramble all over each other for the newest products.But then the main part of the story begins. It's a typical family gathering where people end up angry at each other (another look at the Christmas season's fake niceness). And then, the boy denounces Christmas, releasing the title character. Krampus is the horrific character, but his elves are more like pranksters (and the animated toys bring to mind ""Gremlins""). I suspect that this is one movie that they had fun filming.I had heard of Krampus before watching this. I recall that an episode of ""Grimm"" featured him as the main antagonist (or Wesen, as the show calls them). Austria and the surrounding areas have a Krampuslauf (Krampus run) around Christmas. No doubt they want to remind tykes to be good or else.Basically, this is a movie that you're bound to enjoy. I think that every Christmas party should show this movie, along with ""Gremlins"" and ""The Ref"" (about a cat burglar who kidnaps an obnoxious suburban couple; like this movie, it features a family get-together that goes sour). Have a merry, scary Christmas!",Krampus
8,jboothmillard,Krampus,5,5 January 2017,"I heard a little bit about this dark Christmas film, and I saw the poster with the clawed hand holding a snow globe, and when I heard more about it I certainly became more intrigued to try it. Basically a dysfunctional suburban family are gathering for Christmas - Tom (Piranha's Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette), their children Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) and Max (Emjay Anthony); Sarah's sister Linda (Fargo's Allison Tolman), Linda's husband Howard (Final Destination 5's David Koechner), their children Stevie (Lolo Owen), Jordan (Queenie Samuel), Howie Jr. (Maverick Flack), and their baby daughter; Sarah and Linda's aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell); and Tom's German-speaking mother Omi (Krista Stadler). Following family tensions, Max rips up his letter for Santa Claus and throws it out the window, little does he know that this lack of Christmas spirit has unleashed the wrath of something nasty. The family find themselves trapped, snowed in by a severe blizzard, and the power cut out throughout the town. Beth is the first to disappear, worried about her boyfriend she walks to his house, but is caught in the storm, and finds herself stalked by a mysterious horned creature. Tom and Howard go out searching for Beth, going to the boyfriend's house, but they find it in devastation, with the chimney ripped apart, and giant hoof prints, going back outside Howard is attacked by something hiding in the snow, but Tom saves him. Returning to the house, not knowing what they are up against and panicking, they board up the doors and windows, but during the night the fire dies out, and a hook is lowered down the chimney, on it is a gingerbread man, it comes to life, and Howie is taken up and cannot be saved. Omi knows what is happening, they are being tormented by the Krampus (Luke Hawker, voiced by Gideon Emery), an ancient demonic spirit that punishes those who lose their Christmas spirit, the creature is referred to as the ""shadow of Saint Nicholas"", Omi herself was tortured by the Krampus as a child, her family and other townspeople were dragged to Hell, only she was spared. There are strange noises coming from the attic, the family go to investigate, and many Christmas toys have come to life and start attacking them, including der Klown the demonic jack-in-the-box that swallows Jordan whole, an action figure, a doll, a teddy bear; and three gingerbread men, Lumpy, Dumpy and Clumpy. Following this chaos, the Krampus' elves abduct Dorothy, Howard, and the baby before suddenly leaving again, the remaining family decide to make a run for a snow plow in the street, Omi buys them time by sacrificing herself. Tom, Sarah and Linda are abducted by the snow creature and the elves take Stevie, leaving only Max, he begs the Krampus to give him his family back and take him instead, the creature considers and holds Max over a pit into the underworld, into which Stevie was thrown. Max apologises to the demon for losing his Christmas spirit, Krampus accepts his apology, but throws him into the pit anyway, but Max awakens in bed on Christmas morning, it was all a dream, everything in the house and outside is back to normal, with the family opening presents, the family however are still being watched by the Krampus and his helpers, through a snow globe. Also starring Sophie Gannon as Hero Dark Elf (Bjúgnakrækir), Ivy George as Perchta the Cherub and Seth Green as Lumpy. Scott, Collette and the other cast do their parts fine, it takes a while for the title monster to actually appear, but when he does show up he is suitably nasty looking, the Krampus is based on the European folklore character, but new are the evil gingerbread men and possessed toys, the film is darkly humorous and the complete opposite of the regular cheery Christmas movie, you will either love it for being bonkers, or just say ""bah humbug"" to it, it's an average, mildly enjoyable seasonal comedy horror. Worth watching!",Krampus
9,Woodyanders,Excellent yuletide horror winner,8,26 October 2016,"Young boy Max (a fine and likable portrayal by Emjay Anthony) has become so disillusioned about the Noel season that he inadvertently summons evil ancient spirit Krampus (Luke Hawker in a gnarly animatronic suit) and his equally wicked minions to terrorize his dysfunctional family around Christmastime. Director Michael Dougherty, who also co-wrote the twisted and witty script with Todd Casey and Zach Shields, keeps the enjoyable story moving along at a quick pace, takes time to develop the colorful and distinctive characters, milks plenty of laughs from the wickedly funny sense of pitch-black humor, ably crafts a strong feeling of isolation and vulnerability (the family are trapped inside their home by a fierce blizzard), generates a considerable amount of suspense, maintains a deliciously dark, yet playful tone throughout, stages the attack set pieces with skill and flair, and tops everything off with a surprising downbeat ending. Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: Adam Scott as meek workaholic dad Tom, Toni Collette as harried mother Sarah, Stefania LaVie Owen as the snippy Beth, Krista Stadler as wise and kindly grandmother Omi, Conchata Farrell as the sarcastic Aunt Dorothy, Allison Tolman as the mousy Linda, David Koechner as the crude uncle Howard, and Maverick Flack as the boorish Howie Jr. Kudos are also in order for Jules O'Loughlin's sharp widescreen cinematography, the dynamic shuddery score by Douglas Pipes, and the nifty practical special effects. Best of all, this movie even comes complete with a pertinent central message about the bitter spiritual price one must pay for giving up on the true spirit of the Christmas holiday. Good ghoulish fun.",Krampus
10,BA_Harrison,Have yourself a scary little Christmas.,7,26 December 2017,"Having already given horror fans Trick 'r Treat for Halloween, director Michael Dougherty turns his attention to Christmas, delivering festive escapement and frights with Krampus, in which an evil creature - an 'anti-Santa' - pays a visit to a family who have lost their seasonal spirit.I'm not one for saccharine, family-friendly Xmas movies with a cheery ending (my initials aren't BAH for nothing), and I relish the thought of some demented Christmas comedy/horror. Krampus takes a while to get into the swing of things, but once it does, it's non-stop fun, getting darker and darker as it goes on.Things start out light-hearted enough, with an amusing opening credits sequence that mocks the commercialism of Christmas, and the film continues in this manner up to the moment when disillusioned Santa fan Max (Emjay Anthony) tears up his letter to the jolly old man, an act that is as good as an invitation to Krampus and his helpers.From hereon-in, it's twisted entertainment, as the family (including their National Lampoon's Vacation-style relatives) are captured one-by-one by the horned, cloven-hoofed Krampus, a gang of wicked ginger-bread men, a massive jack-in-a-box, a terrible teddy, a creepy doll, and some nasty elves. Dougherty handles the action with skill, providing moderate scares and silliness in the vein of that other holiday comedy/horror classic, Gremlins.After a lot of enjoyable Chrimbo chaos, with Max's family all captured by Krampus, it looks as though Dougherty has run out of ideas with an 'it was all a dream' conclusion, but a final shot ensures us that all is not as it seems.While not quite in the same league as Gremlins (largely thanks to the slow start and a lack of Phoebe Cates), Krampus should provide those who struggle with seasonal cheer with a few ho-ho-hos and some memorable monster fun.",Krampus
11,paul_haakonsen,'Twas the night before Christmas...,6,15 October 2016,"""Krampus"" was a movie that had initially went under my radar. Sure, I had seen the poster at the cinema back in 2015, but it wasn't a movie that had caught my attention. But I had the chance to sit down and watch it here in 2016, and I must say that this was really a movie where I had been missing out on something.This is a horror comedy movie that manages to take both genres and blend them together for a great outcome. And ""Krampus"" is a movie that really should be seen if you enjoy the horror comedy genre. It has enough comedy to work well on the screen, but it doesn't cross into being a movie where you sit around and laugh at what is going on. The comedy is subtle, to the point and it works. And as for the horror elements, well they are working quite good, especially because there is a great build-up of suspense in the movie at the hands of director Michael Dougherty.The story is a dark twist on the spirit of Christmas. It is about a dysfunctional family that has come together for the Christmas holiday. But young Max is fed up and turns his back on Christmas, and by doing so he inadvertently summons the demonic shadow of Saint Nick, a horrible creature named Kampus who seeks only to punish those who lost faith.As I mentioned before, then there is a great build-up throughout the movie, up until the full intent of the demonic forces are unleashed and finally revealed. And after that, then the movie doesn't lose momentum or becomes less interesting. No, director Michael Dougherty managed to keep the movie go on at the same great pace.There is a good ensemble of cast in this movie, such as David Koechner, Krista Stadler, Adam Scott and Conchata Ferrell. People were performing quite well with their given characters and seemed like they were having a blast being in this movie.The horror elements are also really brought to life on the screen by the special effects and CGI team, as they really managed to pull something impressive out of the gift-sack here, pardon the pun. The effects were realistic and the various creature designs were just fantastic, and there was a great dark spirit that permeated all these designs, and that worked so well in favor of the movie.I was more than genuinely entertained by ""Krampus"" and I am glad that I have finally gotten around to watching it. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I can strongly recommend that you do so, because it is most definitely worth a watch. It might actually have enough contents to become a reoccurring movie to watch during the Christmas holiday.",Krampus
12,Quinoa1984,a fun little Christmas horror comedy for kids (and some adults),6,26 December 2015,"Krampus was something I expected, maybe, a little more from. It's a good little movie where it takes a formula not unfamiliar to fans of Joe Dante - chaos and havoc being wreaked on people from supernatural creatures - and gives it a little extra polish and extra Christmas dimension as the Krampus monster is the inverse of Santa Claus. In short, a little boy has a crappy family dinner (redneck cousins and extended family, with a caricaturish David Koechner) and tears up his letter to Santa (which was read out loud, cruelly, by his dip-s*** cousin anyway). This brings on both the Krampus and his minions, and the family now has to stay alive over one night and a day and change.I think part of the problem is that I could only get half invested in the family, and while it was at times a comedy (there are a number of funny lines throughout, not consistently but in chunks) and the movie asks the audience to care about everyone... well, more or less for some of the less-than-one dimensional kids. Perhaps it was also mismanaged expectations on my part, as I hoped from the look of the trailer the film would be even crazier in its effects and creatures, or gorier. As it is, the son is the main character, and it's his story.This isn't to say that director Michael Dougherty doesn't have imagination - far from it. There are a lot of scenes he's swinging for the fences with some fresh practical effects and monsters (a clown with a tear-away face and big jaws with teeth is a highlight), and even some CGI gingerbread monsters (no, really) are fun yo watch. But there's also a sense of the predictable through some of the story, and it's not enough to carry everything. I have to also give credit for an inspired stop-motion animated sequence where the old grandmother finally speaks English (because why not) and tells the story of how the Krampus came to her village as a girl. And the ending, what it really turns out to be, is extremely clever. It's just not quite as good as my expectations led me to, which isn't't to say for the next Christmas and others it won't be a fun watch. Especially if you're like 8 and older, it's probably a blast.",Krampus
13,Coventry,"O-oh, the monsters in the attic are frightful!",7,4 January 2018,"I must admit that I originally hadn't planned to ever watch ""Krampus"", due to the assumption that it was more of a dark Christmas tale for children (like ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" or ""Gremlins""), but then it suddenly became my ""annual Christmas horror back-up plan""! For you see, I have this stupid but inescapable tradition of watching at least one Christmas-themed horror movie per year and I still hadn't found a suitable title around new year's! Since I've already seen all the classics and couldn't get my hand on the ones that I initially planned to see (either ""Better Watch Out"" or ""All Through the House""), I purchased a copy of ""Krampus"" that was on promo-sale at my local supermarket. And I must say that I'm very glad it turned out this way, as this is seriously one of the biggest pleasant surprises I encountered in years! ""Krampus"" is child-friendly but not childish, and it contains far more suspense, creepy imagery and grisly monsters than I've seen in any other horror film lately. The opening sequences are downright fantastic: to the tunes of a golden oldie Bing Crosby carol, we see a compilation of less joyful holiday sights like crowded supermarkets with people fighting over presents and little kids crying on Santa's lap. It's a nice change from all the usual and fake merry scenes in movies and immediately sets the tone for a different kind of Christmas story. The film further unfolds like an old-fashioned folklore/fairy-tale, with young Max tearing up his letter to Santa Clause and cursing Christmas because his family is fighting at the diner table. By doing so, however, Max summons an ancient creature from the Austrian mythology. Krampus, the evil shadow of Saint Nicolas, punishes the unbelievers of Christmas by covering the entire landscape in ice and unleashing his monstrous toy creatures. ""Krampus"" feels like a mixture between the comedy classic ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" (dysfunctional family spending the holiday period together) and the Dutch horror flick ""Sint"" (demolishing the image of children's heroes), and the result is a fast-paced, atmospheric and beautiful film. There's even a terrific animated flashback interlude, explaining the origins of Krampus and the grandmother's first encounter with him. A lot of time and effort was also put in special effects and monster designs. It takes a while before we get to see Krampus but, luckily, he has an army of creepy minions, like evil gingerbread men, elves and scary dolls. With the excellent ""Trick 'r Treat"", co-writer and director Michael Dougherty already showed his great potential and with ""Krampus"" he forever proved that he's a multi-talented storyteller. Recommended!",Krampus
14,michaelRokeefe,Nothing like your old fashion Christmas.,8,10 August 2016,"Michael Dougherty directs and co-writes this ghoulish holiday fare. Don't expect HOME ALONE or TRICK OR TREAT; expect Christmas on the darker side. This yuletide yarn is based on a German folk tale; a dysfunctional family gathers to clash over the holiday's as usual, but young Max (Emjay Anthony) longs for the better Christmas' of the past. He is disillusioned and has lost his jovial holiday spirit. He doesn't realize that his attitude has unleashed the wrath of Krampus (Luke Hawker), who comes to the surface each year to punish those who have either been very naughty or who have turned their backs on the festive occasion. The evil demonic force brings ancient elves to help pass out punishment for the non-believers. The family should have listened to grandma (Krista Stadler).The story line borders predictable; but is so intense, you're too far invested with the snowy atmosphere template of violence and terror. Don't you just love creepiness coming down the fireplace? There is a bit of dark humor in this twisted Christmas. There is a yuletide soundtrack featuring: Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Brenda Lee, Gene Autry, John Clement Wood and Paul Ottinger.Also starring: Toni Collette, Adam Scott, David Koechner, Stefania LaVie Owen, Maverick Flack and Conchata Ferrell as Aunt Dorothy.",Krampus
15,Scarecrow-88,Krampus,7,18 December 2015,"I think Krampus, for me, is one of the great surprises of the year just in terms of its intensity and how it truly turns the Anti-Santa premise loose on us. You will never see the Gingerbread Man quite the same again. The Jack in the Box, Porcelain Dolly, and Teddy Bear have never quite been so monstrous, ghoulish, and wicked! Seeing Jack gobble up a kid (well we see wiggling shoes as Jack takes a gulp!), the Gingerbread Man giggling as it plunges toward a kid (wrapping him in chain as he's pulled up a chimney!), multiple Gingerbread men shooting nails from a nailgun with glee (!!!) at one of the film's heroes, the Dolly trying to strangle a victim with Christmas Lights, the Teddy Bear with a mouth full of sharp teeth ready to bit tries to gnaw a victim's arm off during an assault, and a robot toy decides to go on a tactical strike with a knife blade mechanism that stabs repeatedly! Oh, the Jack in the Box has a worm like body and decides to flee through the ventilation ducts of the house! If that wasn't enough, Krampus is Santa if he had hooves, was shaped like a large snail, a tongue that slithers out of this face somewhat similar to St Nick, and stomps around quaking everywhere he lands. Oh, and the elveswell if elves were the size of hefty 8 year old boys and wore masks similar to the creepy intruders from The Strangers (2008), then obviously they belong to Krampus.The snowglobe ""limbo"" twist at the end just left me rather smirking even if it is so eyerollingly sillyalthough, the film isn't the least bit realistic once Max (Emjay Anthony) rips apart a letter to Santa and tosses it out the window into the wind. What lies within that momentary lapse of control and through the action of the letter's ""dismissal"" summons a different kind of visiting ""holiday spirit"".Max loses his cool when the dysfunctional relatives arrive. Max's mom, Sarah (Toni Collette) has a sister, Linda (Allison Tolman), married to a sports-obsessed gun devotee asshole (David Koechner) who raises even his girls as tomboys, speaks without thinking, and has contempt for Sarah's husband, Tom (Adam Scott, quite good in a rare dramatic part). Linda brings a son along who rarely speaks but has quite an appetite and an aunt (played by scene-stealing Conchata Ferrell of Two and a Half Men fame) who loves the eggnog as long as it has a little added liquor for extra effect. Max has a sister, Beth (Stefanie LaVie Owen), a bit too clever and hip for the family her parents find so taxing and obnoxious. When Koechner's girls (dressed in logger shirts, wearing ball caps; all they need are some tobacco so they spit in a can when needed) read aloud Max's Santa letter, this sets off the chain of events that lead to the accidental calling of Krampus. The film even includes an animated sequence where Max's German grandma (Krista Stadler) tells of her youth and calling of Krampus, which is quite a thing of beauty.The neighborhood gone white with a blizzard, houses gutted by Krampus' *visits*, a snow plow left stranded in the middle of the road, and Beth (who went to see her boyfriend, with parents' regrettable permission) trying to hide underneath a delivery van (with a driver frozen in the front seat after being scared to death) with a musical box opening and unveiling one of Krampus' ""helpers"", the film really startled me with its creature feature sensibilities. Don't bring the kids to this one, though. I learned the hard way. Krampus and his gang scared the hell out of them. I delighted in the very parts that scared them, though, I must admit. The movie does its job. This family are visited upon by a horror that isn't yuletide.",Krampus
16,Hey_Sweden,"And all through the house, a whole damn bunch of creatures were stirring.",7,1 December 2016,"""Krampus"", based on actual folklore in Germany and Austria, may not be without faults, but damn if it isn't a reasonably impressive new addition to the canon of Yuletide genre movies. It starts out as an obnoxious domestic comedy, as one family welcomes their grating relatives in for the holidays. Young Max, played by the very appealing Emjay Anthony, is so distraught by the friction between his kin that he destroys his letter to Santa and turns his back on the Christmas season. Big mistake: an imposing demon named Krampus makes it his mission to punish - make that SEVERELY punish - all those who lose their hopes and beliefs. Soon, horrible weather conditions presage an escalating series of terrors for Max and company.Co-written and directed by Michael Dougherty, who also gave us a modern Halloween favorite in the form of ""Trick r Treat"", this is surprisingly engaging entertainment. However, it's not so much a horror comedy, as it is a full-blown horror movie with some moments of levity. Despite the PG-13 rating, it's not for the youngest members of your own family due to some incredible intensity. It does take on the tones of a nightmare.It does have its pleasures, such as a rich variety of ""monsters"", which are huge, hideous abominations of familiar toys and goodies. (This viewers' personal favorite was the anaconda sized Jack in the box.) There is some very potent atmosphere and quite a bit of macabre imagery filling up the 2.35:1 frame.How one responds to the protagonists will most likely affect how they respond to the film. Yours truly wouldn't have minded seeing almost everybody get theirs. Still, the actors give it 100%: Adam Scott and Toni Collette as Maxs' parents, David Koechner as the gun loving uncle, Conchata Ferrell as the grumpy great aunt, and Krista Stadler as the wise grandmother who knows the score, right from the start.A solid diversion overall, with some groan inducing dialogue and moments but quite a bit of energy & pizazz and a twisted nature.Seven out of 10.",Krampus
17,preppy-3,Interesting but not altogether successful,6,10 December 2015,"Horror/comedy about a young boy who still believes in Santa and writes him a letter. However his relatives make fun of him and mock him for believing in Santa. In anger he tears up the letter and loses all hope for Christmas. This calls up the Krampus--the dark side of St. Nicholas. He preys--and kills--people who have given up hope and don't believe in Christmas. Soon the family and relatives are under siege by killer gingerbread men (I'm not kidding) and toys made big and evil by the Krampus to punish them.The movie has its moments (both comedic and horror) and has mostly good acting but doesn't quite gel. The script is scatter shot and never quite reaches a consistent tone. The attacks by the gingerbread men, evil toys and elves are fun. They're pretty violent and bloody (for a PG-13) and full of action. However the ending seems a cheat although it is open to interpretation. Also Adam Scott gives a terrible performance as the father of the family. So it was well-done but sort of confusing and lacking.",Krampus

All this negativity unleashes the eponymous monster bent on seeking out the santa-phobes amongst us! Woe betide anyone who crosses them; they can possess anything from an huge great snowplough to a gingerbread cookie and they are relentless in their pursuit of the miserable. It could have been quite good fun, but the cast really do deserve their comeuppance (except, maybe, ""Omi"" (Krista Stadler) who has the wisdom of her years). The acting is as wooden as the contrived drama created by their noisy intolerance of each other.

However, in the KRAMPUS dimension, this is the Bell from Hell. Most viewers will be hoping for the violent and gruesome Christmas Guests deaths seemingly promised in the KRAMPUS preview during the first hour of this movie. Because everyone in this flick is White, and since Granny Jibber-Jabbers mostly in German, this story shapes up to be some kind of weird revenge tale dating back to Slavery and\or Nazi Days during its early going. However, as the horror becomes more dream-like, the cloying-if-seasonal WIZARD OF OZ close is clearly telegraphed as being inevitable. Though KRAMPUS might be a little too juvenile to have any behavior modifying impact upon the Seven & Up crowd, it could be a good bet to keep toddlers through kindergärtners in line during this Holiday Season. But remember, it will have much more impact to say, ""If you do THAT again, KRAMPUS and His Elves will come to our house this month"" if you actually take your tykes to see this show first.",Krampus

Max's slightly dysfunctional family is getting prepared for Christmas when Mum's sister and her very dysfunctional family arrive, and everything goes pear-shaped. After his cousins rag him unmercifully about his letter to Santa, Max rips it to pieces and throws it to the wind, wishing bad things on everyone. And these wishes summon Krampus, a spirit who is Santa's dark shadow. As an unnatural storm sets in, Max's family is beset by Krampus and his anti-elf little helpers.Krampus starts out as a fairly routine comedy of seasonal embarrassment and errors, an impression which the presence of David Koechner as crass brother-in-law/uncle only adds to. But the move to horror film is smooth, and there are times when humour and horror co-exist effectively.The cast is good, especially the youngsters, and all perform well. I was pleased that the horror elements weren't made up of ""made you jump"" moments but were, instead, built nicely and atmospherically: the storm gives a sense of claustrophobia as the two families are effectively trapped in the one room which has an open fire, while Things go bump upstairs and outside.With production from the Peter Jackson camp, and effects by Weta, the production values are high.

Vividly remembering the holiday cheer gone awry ads I saw when it hit the big screen last X-Mas,I decided that it was the perfect time to pull a Krampus cracker.View on the film:Staying in the family home for most of the movie,the ensemble cast give excellent performances which spill seasonal merriment with frosty screams. Shooting his mouth at any awkward family members and shooting his guns at a ""special"" greeting from Krampus.David Koechner gives a hilarious performance as Howard,whose brave face breaks the moment anything creepy is unwrapped,as Conchata Ferrell glazes the flick with a deadpan relish as the less than lovable Aunt Dorothy. Sprinkling the Horror-Comedy tinsel with melancholy, Allison Tolman gives Linda a strong feeling of trying to put a positive image on things,and Krista Stadler (who got cast after the last 3 originally chosen choices all quit!) causes the family to break out in a holiday chill,as Tom's creepy mum Omi.For the Krampus folk tale,the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Todd Casey and Zach Shields) dip into eerie fantasy that seeps into the ""perfect"" Christmas image.Pushing the ""traditional"" X-Mas image on its side with a cheeky opening,the writers stamp down on the stollen with thunderous Creature Feature Horror shakes,landing with a thump from the appearance of the title character,and leaping in the air thanks to a quirky collection of Krampus ""friends"" from murderous gingerbread men (!) to screeching elves.Bringing the family together over the fear of Krampus,the writers smoothly balance gooey Comedy-Horror with a warming message of finding the meaning of family in an intelligent manner that never becomes sickly sweet. Throwing Max out to find his dream Christmas,the writers unleash a deliciously macabre twist ending,which wonderfully casts the film into the Gothic X-Mas tales direction.Opening with a highly-stylish slo-mo sequence that drops a dollop of acid on the mince pie, director Michael Dougherty grips his long delayed return to the big screen with an infectious atmosphere,lit in gliding tracking shots that pick up every crumbling floorboard that Krampus and his pals stamp on.Whilst not going for outright terror, Dougherty and cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin take the horror down an extremely creative chimney, wrapped in delightful Monster Movie screams soaked in deep reds,greens and whites,which includes startling unique gifts that include a dazzling stop-motion animation sequence,as Krampus comes to town.",Krampus

In this one particular family everything is a routine rush until relatives arrive and chaos follows. Nasty words are spoken. Criticism scorches the air. The belief in Santa dies when one boy's letter is stolen by a cousin and read aloud in mockery. Enraged he rips it up. The result is the power going out and ominous snowmen appearing about the yard. There is something sinister lurking and its demonic influence even transcends to gingerbread cookies that nab one of the boys up a chimney. The production values here are effective and creepy but its dark tone may make for entertainment not fitting for the season. Many of the characters are cardboard although Toni Collette holds her own as a frustrated mother whose hard work slaving for Christmas dinner is met with discontent. David Koechner as her brother-in-law is a steal. He attempts to brave the storm with a shotgun but ends up fending off nail gun brandishing Christmas cookies. Conchata Ferrell as the crabby and drunken Aunt Dorothy is also a hoot. Other characters are not nearly as flashy. Theme regards the importance of not taking things for granted. It is a similar theme used in Home Alone when little Kevin is met with answers that he wasn't prepared for. The effects are frighteningly spectacular with a little hint of the naughty.

One of the better elements featured here is the fact that this one really overwhelms the seasonal work here with the holiday set-up featured throughout here. Basing the film deep in the folklore and using the familiar trappings of the holiday, it gives this the excuse to readily utilize the basic elements found in the day with the house all decorated with the usual ornaments, wreaths, presents and lighted statues placed throughout here which really gives this the appropriately festive appeal that runs for the whole film and is only enhanced with the onset of the storm that continues blowing throughout here. It's a fine frosty coating overlaid through the whole film and really helps to place the whole film in the proper tone and atmosphere while giving this one the balance required to make the later scenes with the different killer toys and Christmas- based ornaments under his command feel all the more closely tied together. The scenes of the walking gingerbread men and the different dolls that come to life and attack the family are quite appropriately apart of this set-up that really makes this one quite exciting and enjoyable due to the rather close tie-in which is what makes this one so much fun. Likewise, the fact that there's quite the fun build-up to the action scenes here is rather enjoyable as there's some fun making the family struggles come to light quite early on as the slight indications of the creature approaching makes this one quite chilling, and once it becomes obvious all their antics have led to their assault that gives the film a solid set-up which lets the early action scenes all the more exciting. The big action scenes, from the creature appearing at the snow-plow hunting the lone member outside the house, the search-party arriving at the ransacked house finding the creature already having taken them and the first instances of the main house seeing the different attacks occurring in the living room all give this one quite a solid foundation with the different chases throughout the upper floors in the house seeing the different creatures attacking the household. Even the final battle with the creature in the house is quite fun and chilling with the family taking the big stand against the creature results in plenty of great action, and the fantasy-based resolution does fit in quite nicely here all giving this one a rather nice twist ending. Along with the fantastic creature backstory and the overall design, these give this one plenty to love that hold it up over the films' small flaws. The first issue here is the needless jerky camera movements during the action scenes, which makes it really difficult to see what you really want to see and lets the obvious CGI shine through quite easily. The other flaw here is the fact that there's a pointless backstory done in a really lousy animation style that pads out this one needlessly when the straightforward story could've been told in a better, less distracting manner. These here are what hold it back.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and intense themes of children-in- jeopardy.",Krampus
26,FlashCallahan,Shepherds gotta protect his flock......,7,29 March 2016,"When his family clash over the holidays, Max becomes disillusioned about all the magic surrounding the holidays and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know, this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of the titular character, a force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a hellish life of their own, laying siege to the family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive..........To enjoy this film fully is not to take it seriously at all, it isn't primarily a horror movie, it's an almost homage to the comedy horrors that auteur's like Landis and Dante gave us in their heyday.Heavily influenced by Gremlins and that really weird segment of The Twilight Zone movie that featured a scary rabbit, Krampus heavily relies on the wonderful effects delivered by Weta, and the chemistry between the the three main members of the family, Collette, Scott, and Koechner, they are really good in this and just bounce off each other.The casting of Collette is a work of genius, he makers could have gone for someone like Poehler, Wiig, or Fey, but then it would have been an out and out comedy. Collette plays it straight all the way through, despite all the craziness that surrounds the narrative.The plot itself is pretty simple, boy turns his back on the magic, evil spirit comes to get vengeance, and wouldn't you know it, it all happened before to the German grandmother years ago. After all, that's where the legend originates from.Krampus himself is a wondrous creation, a Neo Gothic being, he looks like a possessed Santa Claus.........Satan Claus if you would.But it's his henchmen who bring the laughs, especially the gingerbread men, whom basically rip off the atypical Gremlin.Although the film isn't scary in the slightest, it can she pretty tense at times, and would be a little too unsettling for younger children, even though it is tongue in cheek.The ending is a little bit of a cop out, especially if you consider sub plots revealed earlier on in the film, but overall, it's nothing more than a fun creature feature to watch on a cold winters night.",Krampus

Adam Scott and Toni Collette play Anthony's parents, and Allison Tolman and David Koechner play his brash aunt and uncle. Conchata Ferrell (who, along with Koechner, provide most of the film's laughs) also co-stars. As you might expect, she's always quick with a quip.

32,StevePulaski,Narrative shortcomings and obscurities work to derail a potential revival for a forgotten genre,4,7 December 2015,"Much like Michael Dougherty's directorial debut ""Trick 'r Treat,"" which has gone on to embed itself as a contemporary Halloween classic, one can hardly fault ""Krampus"" for trying to interject some life and memorability into the forgotten formula of Christmas horror that was ostensibly left for dead in the 1990's. Unlike the last Christmas horror offering in theaters - the remake of Bob Clark's ""Black Christmas"" nearly ten years ago, ""Krampus"" boasts an actual backstory and folklore going all the way back to days of Paganism. Cross that with a cast of proved comedic talents, such as Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and ""Two and a Half Men""'s Conchata Ferrell, and you ostensibly have a genre hybrid that attempts to restore the magic of Christmas scares.The sad part is that ""Krampus"" is the kind of film that feels like lightning will strike and it will, all of a sudden, be a strong piece of comedy/horror without having to rely on storytelling or genuine scares in order to be successful. It fails to realize that its concept doesn't hold a lot of weight in the public mind, and that a film like this needs to introduce and give some sort of development to its titular villain in order for audiences to really establish any sort of connection.The film revolves around a suburb family during the holidays made up of: young husband and wife Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette), their daughter Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) and their son Max (Emjay Anthony), Sarah's sister Linda (Allison Tolman) and her husband Howard (David Koechner), along with their children three children and newborn daughter, Sarah's aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell), and Tom's Austrian mother (Krista Sadler), who only speaks broken English. The opening twenty-five minutes of the film show that this family is an irreparable mess of ungratefulness, arguments, and conflicting intentions, most of which revolving around the tactless behavior of Linda and Howard's side of the family, which doesn't stop at their kids' relentless bullying and aggression towards Max.Max, who still wants to believe in Santa despite age and young adult wisdom beginning to come into play, finally gets so frustrated with the bullying that he rips his letter to Santa to shreds and throws it out the window. The pieces of the letter then get sucked into the sky and ignite a fierce blizzard, one with incalculable snowfall and whiteout conditions that knock out the power, phone-lines, and cell-phone service. Stranded in their own home, when Beth's decision to go visit her boyfriend during the storm results in her not coming home, Tom's mother reveals that this storm and its weird activities are caused by Krampus, a demon who punishes those naughty on Christmas. With that, Krampus - and what looks to be his band of monsters, which are anything from violent gingerbread cookies, psychotic snowmen, to anything that looks like it could've escaped from the screen showing ""Goosebumps"" - winds up abducting certain members of the family all while they are trapped like sitting ducks.Where exactly does Krampus take Beth and his other victims? What is the history of Krampus and how did he come about? Why is he haunting this particular family who holds animosity for one another like most families do this holiday season? Why did Krampus take Beth, one of the more innocent members of the family? Who are the other monsters that Krampus works in conjunction with? These are some of the questions that Dougherty and cowriters Tom Casey and Zach Shields should be working to answer, but instead, they're all overcome with the mistake that an overwhelming audio-track filled with synths and loud, sudden bangs and cacophonous noise substitute for scares.These storytelling shortcomings are especially upsetting given what Dougherty manages to effectively make ""Krampus"" leading up to the more climactic sequences. To begin with, while comedy is definitely infused in ""Krampus""'s script, it's pleasantly understated comedy that revolves around family contempt. Most of the quips and zingers in the film are family members mumbling things under their breaths in a stunningly realistic manner, showing the trio of screenwriters are definitely more concerned with believable and location-specific comedy than brazen humor or slapstick. In addition, Krampus is physically revealed throughout the film, meaning there's no one moment where the score kicks in and we see a full shot of Krampus from top to bottom. Dougherty and cinematographer Jules O'Loughlin do their best to give us sporadic ideas into the physical appearance of Krampus while making him a visual enigma, keeping the audience, at the very least, in-tuned and interested in what Krampus looks to be.But around the forty-five minute mark, when we haven't seen too much, we don't really know too much, and there isn't much to keep us invested other than what the titular demon truly looks like, ""Krampus"" goes from being a silly comedy-drama about a family not getting along (I already had to endure ""Love the Coopers"" last month) to a wild and cluttered horror film full of noise and narrative obscurities. While the latter would be more suited and acceptable for a generic holiday slasher, it isn't acceptable for a film that wants us to get to know the origin and the roots of a certain character. Even the relatively minimalist and threadbare ""It Follows"" thrived on moodiness and metaphoric resonance in a way that captivated and at least gave the viewer something in return if they were willing to try and seriously follow the narrative. ""Krampus"" isn't horribly predictable, nor is it of extremely poor quality, but its select narrative shortcomings bring down an otherwise fascinating project from a genre that will continue to go by the wayside in the modern day if films like this become the quality-standard.",Krampus

Now I actually really liked ""Trick 'r Treat"" but this was barely passable for me. I give it some respect for it not trying to be more than what it is, which is a Christmas survival horror. And how it doesn't try to rely too much on blood and gore to get the audiences attention. In fact it's a PG-13 movie, so the whole family can sit and watch it while not getting offended by it. Besides that this is a very straightforward survival horror movie that doesn't really bring anything new to the genre. Plus some of the scenes doesn't make much sense, but I guess some of it was to show that women can be empowering and rational in survival situations. Despite the title, Krampus isn't really in this movie all that much at all. In fact Krampus is utilized more like the ""The Ring"" girl Sadako.

35,Hellmant,It's a pretty straightforward horror flick actually!,8,7 December 2015,"'KRAMPUS': Four Stars (Out of Five)A horror-comedy flick, based on the folklore character (of the title). The film was directed by Michael Dougherty (who's most well known for helming the 2007 cult horror flick 'TRICK 'R TREAT'), and it was written by Dougherty, Todd Casey and Zach Shields. The movie stars Adam Scott, Toni Collette, David Koechner, Allison Tolman, Conchata Ferrell, Stefania LaVie Owen and Emjay Anthony. It revolves around a boy, who loses his faith in Christmas, and accidentally summons an ancient evil force. The film is a well made, and effective horror flick; but it's just a little too slow- paced, for my taste.Max (Anthony) has always loved, and believed in, Christmas; but this year he's started to lose his 'festive spirit'. His aunts (Tolman and Ferrell) and uncle (Koechner) have come to visit, with their kids, and they're really testing Max's patience. His sister (Owen), and their parents (Scott and Collette), are not too happy with the extended family visit either. Max tears up a Christmas wish, he wrote, involving all of his family; and throws it out the window. By doing this, he unwittingly calls a terrifying Christmas demon, called Krampus, and it's twisted helpers.The movie is darkly funny, in places, but it's never as humorous, as I was expecting it to be (especially given the cast); it's a pretty straightforward horror flick actually! The film isn't that gory, or overly violent, but it is pretty creepy; and somewhat terrifying. I really like, and enjoyed, most of the movie (it reminds me of the kind of scary movies I liked as a kid); but it definitely takes a while to really get going (there's a ton of buildup, before the payoff). Those who really enjoy slow-paced, moody horror flicks (especially holiday themed ones, like Dougherty is becoming an expert in), shouldn't be disappointed.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13nGzq8Gvgo",Krampus

Especially since 2000ish, 9.5 out of 10 horror movies released are ghost stories – bah! – and to prove that, the jam packed list of horror previews before this feature, were ALL ghost/haunted house movies.I digress, this half/half comedy/horror, was one of the best horror films I've seen in a while. Though not as good as the Director/Writer's other horror effort, Trick 'r Treat, it stood alone fairly welleven when the second act kind of dragged a bit.That said, the first and third acts were the best. The first was strictly comedy and had a ton of LOL moments from me. The third was genuinely scary in parts and all the hopes I had, from the information given in Act 2well, I can't say how they panned out without spoilers. Needless to say, I loved the final act, including the awesome ending.Basically, the Anti-Claus isn't one you want to summon, but as horror movies gothat's what happens to this dysfunctional household. Once the comedy's over and the drawn-out background and suspense-building scenes are over, the terror becomes all too real and it's onfor this family to come together, finally. Just took a scary legion of super meanies to do the trick.Completely recommended, especially for those who love Christmas Horror shockers and dark comedy in both an otherwise plagued subgenre of holiday films of joy and brightness and far too many unoriginal ghost stories.",Krampus

38,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Flat, ineffective yuletide horror comedy",4,14 August 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In their large, secluded home in the woods, married couple Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette) are preparing to host their dysfunctional family for the Christmas period, whilst dealing with their two equally rambunctious offspring, including son Max (Emjay Anthony) who tears up a letter to Santa after getting disillusioned with them all. Sadly, this invokes the spirit of Santa's nasty brother Krampus, who plunges the family into a devastating game of yuletide destruction.The weather may be cold outside, but Christmas is always the warmest of the holidays, a time when the family must get together and be warm and happy. But all that warmth and cheer can get a bit too much for some, and so over the years, the phenomenon of the 'alternative' Christmas film came about, where the Christmas cheer is converted into something a little darker and more adult. Michael Dougherty's Krampus is one such example, a Christmas horror which introduces us to Santa's wicked brother, who many on this side of the Atlantic ocean may not have heard of.With elements of some of Tim Burton's more outlandish offerings, this forms an uneasy mix of horror and comedy, but somehow there is not enough depth invested in either the characters or the story to make any of it tingle. The set up certainly had potential, and the effects have the kind of childlike awe factor that makes these kinds of film sparkle, but it all feels like a big flat, wasted opportunity.Somehow, though, I feel there'll be a sequel. **",Krampus
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,You better watch out...,6,25 December 2020,"'Krampus (2015)' is centred around the myth of its eponymous creature, a dark reflection of Santa Claus who punishes naughty children - and, in this case, entire families. The narrative involves an extended family gathering that goes a little bit wrong when an argument breaks out between cousins with opposing views on whether or not Father Christmas is real. When all Christmas spirit is sapped from the family, Krampus is called to drag them all to hell. Most of the movie involves various members of the family being picked off by the big bad's various minions, learning to work together as they try to find a way out of their bleak situation. There are scenes in which it feels as though it wants to be a full-on comedy-horror, which are probably its most successful moments. The movie never goes far enough down this path, though. As such, it doesn't so much as feel cohesive as it does tonally inconsistent. Still, the affair maintains a decent atmosphere throughout and is coated with a looming sense of dread. It's rather visceral, at times, despite being relatively bloodless. It's also straight-up silly at others, even though its stakes are always sincere. It all comes together in an ending that sort of seems rushed. It's not bad, but it feels a little half-baked and doesn't quite have the impact it perhaps should. Overall, this is a relatively enjoyable alternate Christmas flick. It isn't all that scary and it isn't all that funny, but it works well enough to be worth a watch during the holiday season. 6/10",Krampus
40,bowmanblue,National Lampoon's (horrific!) Christmas Vacation,7,21 June 2017,"Sometimes you know you're going to enjoy a film from the moment it starts. The opening to the horror film 'Krampus' is a montage of Christmas shoppers, all fighting and – practically – rioting as they try to snap up the best bargains for themselves. It was within these early minutes that the film made it clear that it didn't take itself seriously and didn't expect me to do either. In short: it was a tongue-in-cheek little number and wanted the world to know it.We meet our 'typical' family who are getting together for the holidays. And, I say 'typical' because, instead of all getting along perfectly, they (like us?) are basically just pretending to for the duration. However, the pretence finally snaps when the young boy has an outburst and storming off to his room. Rather than the only effects of this meaning he gets an hour less Xbox time, he inadvertently summons up an evil 'anti-Santa' demon known as 'Krampus,' who descends upon the family to drag them off to the underworld one by one. So, the family must fight for their survival (while also doing their best not to fight each other – at least some of the time!).As you can probably tell, I enjoyed the movie. It's not trying to be anything amazing, other than a darkly comic little caper with shades of horror and a dash of social commentary. And, despite it's 'PG13' rating robbing it of its gore, it is pretty dark. The monster itself is well done (looks like practical effects to me rather than CGI – always a bonus) and his minions amusing while being horrific at the same time (although I think the psychotic gingerbread men were CGI!). If you're into this sort of thing then you should be entertained for the duration. There are a few minuses – the little boy is a bit annoying, but luckily the adults (especially David Koechner!) make up for the child's inexperience. Plus the German grandma was put in there purely for purposes of explaining Krampus to the family (and us, the audience). Then there's a nice little mini animation in the middle of the film that sort of goes some way to explaining Krampus' origins. It's well done, but does seem a little out of place amidst the rest of the carnage.But those are only minor gripes. For some reason I found myself watching 'Krampus' on a boiling evening in mid June. I think it's better watched at Christmas. I think after a few long weeks of listening to Christmas songs and having to make sure everyone has enough presents to keep them from hating me for another year, I'll definitely watch this film again (and do my best not to wish Krampus on my extended family!).",Krampus

I have seen odder movies, check my reviews, but I have never seen such an odd movie with A-list production values, SFX and casting.2. The opening title sequence is one of the best I have ever seen. Do they give Oscars for that? If they did, it would win.3. The next 10 minutes after the titles is very X-Mas with the Kranks and actually funny and engaging. THEY SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH THAT THEME.4. The rest of the movie is very Gremlins and Tremors and not very engaging or very entertaining or very anything. Just odd. Very very odd.What a waste of resources that could have been used to make a better movie!",Krampus
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Real Bad Santa,6,20 December 2019,"I've abstained from reviewing Krampus since I first saw it in the cinema four years ago as I could never figure out what the movie's problems and strengths were, but after seeing the movie five times now and feeling the same frustrations over and over I think I've got it sussed.Krampus is best described as a combination of Christmas Vacation and Gremlins, opening with a satire of mindless Yuletide consumerism before settling in with a middle-class family in the suburbs including German grandma, emotionally distant teen daughter, and idealistic son. Their cheer is soon ruined by the arrival of extended family who bring trashy, redneck values that are at odds with the atmosphere of the household. After mocking the poor son's belief in Santa Claus and his desire for a wholesome family Christmas he decides not to mail his letter to the big man and rips it up, surrendering the shreds to the winter wind.Someone else is the recipient of that letter. Someone darker and malevolent.A darkness falls over the neighborhood, town, and world, isolating our disparate gang from any outside saviors while a host of nasty creatures invade their safe space, offing them one by one, and it's at this point the movie begins to come apart as the pacing and structure becomes far too chaotic and annoying. A clever kill every ten minutes with clearly defined rules and building mystery would have resulted in a far better movie, but Michael Dougherty fumbles this all-important middle act, leaving the audience desperate and impatient for a quick ending.The practical effects in this movie are also quite, quite appalling, especially the actual Krampus creature, which barely has any points of articulation. Even the 1987 Garbage Pail Kids looked better than this. Exactly what are his minions supposed to be? What are the rules here? Some wonderfully devilish elves appear but nothing is done with them and they disappear just as fast. The fight against the demonic toys in the attic is terribly done, with nothing clearly shot, and also confusingly intercut with a ridiculous gingerbread man fight in the kitchen. The cutting back and forth between these events neuters both to the point of irrelevance.In its favor, Krampus has surprisingly good characterisation, an immense amount of atmosphere and a cold, otherworldly feel that really helps sell this as a dark Christmas alternative. So many movies aim to be the new Christmas classic and become an annual tradition but the majority of them fail. Krampus barely makes the grade. This could/should have been a much better movie and I can understand why less patient viewers would dislike it.",Krampus

This is a movie that you really can't explain and just has to be seen to appreciate. This is not a typical horror movie in the sense many that are wanting to see this are expecting.

49,Reno-Rangan,A creepy Christmas tale of a family.,7,4 May 2016,"Probably no one would have anticipated it, this is a surprise movie, especially being an anti-Christmas theme. Possibly the one last time I enjoyed was a Finnish film called 'Rare Export', that's the name came in my mind after watching this. I also could not believe this rated PG13, well it differs in other countries. Of course, there are plenty of intensified frightening scenes, even for the adults, but no gores. The violence parts were well edited/shot, yet it makes sure they're still part of the story without showing them. I think it was a smart filmmaking keeping in mind the family audience. So in the end, I guess it paid off well.I did not know the plot, as well as a few words that referred in the movie. But while watching it, I was worried about the graphics, because this is not a big budget film. Even the cast was not from the top league. Overall, it achieved a good result, that's the point. There are no major flaws as well, and the small ones can be easily ignorable. Because on the other side the movie provides a good suspenseful entertainment that makes you not to move the body or the eyeballs. After I'm saying all these, you should at least consider giving it a shot. But remember there's no story in it, it was constructed on a panic situation during the heavy blizzard when one after another begin to disappear.7/10",Krampus

It can't decide if it wants to be a horror or a horror comedy, and the mix doesn't work. This would have been so amazing as a full-on horror, but it gets very weird, and is not serious enough when it ought to be. The effects remain amazing, though.

51,eddie_baggins,Krampus is no Xmas treat,4,19 May 2016,"A refreshing change of pace for the horror genre and the Christmas genre and a hearkening back to the good old Gremlin like days of the 80's, Krampus is at first glance an enjoyable experience but as Michael Dougherty's film journeys on you begin to realise you're becoming less and less engaged by a movie that has great potential, yet not a great execution.The anchoring component of Krampus is a pretty dark one when all considered, evil Xmas nasty terrorises a family during the Xmas silly season and Dougherty's (noteworthy director of the cult favourite Trick 'r Treat) film is actually a lot more sinister than you'd expect from its rating as Krampus isn't afraid to dispatch both the young and old and characters as they come and go in quick succession as the body count rises and the possessed ginger breads increase in numbers. It's neat that the film isn't worried about ridding itself of a majority of its cast of unlikeable characters but all is mainly for nought as the uneasy balance between dark comedy and horror tropes fail to connect.The aforementioned Gremlins and films of that bloodline succeed on the back of a near perfect balance of terrors, laughs and heart and while Krampus try's its utmost to make the audience care for young tyke Max and his family led by parental matriarchs in the form of struggling married couple Adam Scott's Tom and Toni Collette's Sarah it's hard to care at all about if they survive this particularly dangerous yuletide season and the films saving grace ends up being a quality bulldog and some inventive creatures like some bloodthirsty clowns and some unfriendly house invading elves. In the end, whatever life lessons Krampus wants to impart on its viewers, they're are lost in an event that's only a small portion of what it could've been.There's a really fun and entertaining time to be had from Krampus but unfortunately it's not from Dougherty's film and in the end Krampus is only a stark reminder that when it comes to these types of hybrid films, the 80's certainly did it better and in a much more memorable fashion.2 murderous gingerbread men out of 5",Krampus

It seems to come out of nowhere, and most of the time you can't even make out what's doing the killing, even when you get a good look at it.The movie just turns into boring, derivative attack scenes with people screaming and trying to avoid whatever's after them.

This is a good combination of horror, fantasy and comedy. It certainly starts off with the emphasis on humour but becomes darker as it progresses. Although much of the cast is comprised of young kids I think it would be unsuitable for pre teen children. There are a few good jump moments plus plenty of on screen violence. A bit of swearing too. Credit to David Koechner and Conchata Ferrell, great performances delivering much of the humour. Toys coming to life reminded me of some horror movies from the 80's/early 90's. Trouble I found here is that much action takes place in the loft and there was too much going on in a confined space. Without giving it away there was a good twist at the end.

All they want to do is punish and destroy anything in their paths; pretty much the opposite of the Santa that we all know and love. This dysfunctional family is really in for a couple of days of torture and mayhem.

With its relatively gore-free delights and wicked sense of humor, it's a ""PG-13""-rated horror picture that rightfully EARNS its ""PG-13"" rating and is a welcome change-of-pace from most other gore-filled, special effects-laden horror films of late.Equal parts horror, dark fantasy and family comedy, ""Krampus"" plays out a lot like a darkly comic mix of ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" (1989) and ""Home Alone"" (1990), combined with ""Gremlins"" (1984). ""Krampus"" is a holiday-themed horror film to watch if you're snowed in by yourself or with friends or family (whose company you can, or cannot, do without).The film's opening credits sequence sets up the overall darkly comic, cynical tone of the picture, with a crowd of Black Friday shoppers rushing the front doors of a department store looking for the latest in holiday gifts. (This scene would be ludicrous were it not a real-life phenomenon around this time of year.) Afterward, we're immediately introduced to 30-ish hard-working family man Tommy (Adam Scott, of TV's ""Parks and Recreation""), his wife Sarah (Toni Collette), their teenage daughter Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen), and their young son Max (Emjay Anthony). Adam's German-speaking mother Omi (Krista Stadler) is also in town for the holidays.They're getting their home together in preparation for Sarah's redneck sister Linda (Allison Tolman), her husband Howard (David Koechner), and their two tomboy daughters Stevie (Lolo Owen) and Jordan (Queenie Samuel), Howie, Jr. (Maverick Flick), and Baby Chrissy (Sage Hunefeld). Tagging along unexpectedly is Linda and Sarah's aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell).What we get with these 12 family members is typical family dysfunction. Young Max is caught in the middle of it, who also appears to be the only one who really believes in the spirit of Christmas, and wishes for ""Christmas to be like it used to be."" Well, he's about to get his wish, when the so-called ""dark shadow of Saint Nicholas,"" Krampus, a horned, hoofed monstrous parody of the Santa Claus that we all know and love, and his army of demonic minions, drop in and begin terrorizing everyone over one chilling Christmas holiday season.""Krampus,"" from director/co-screenwriter Michael Dougherty, is one hell of a thrilling holiday-themed horror-comedy/dark fantasy film. The actors all fill out their roles quite nicely - young Emjay Anthony, in particular. While young child actors in the horror genre are nothing new, Emjay Anthony is a delight as a young boy who must learn the hard way about ""being careful about what you wish for - because you might just get it."" I also single out Adam Scott, who is better known for lighter comedic fanfare, because of how he plays Tommy rather straight-faced, while also in a self-knowing manner that acknowledges his awareness of the inherent absurdity of the whole thing. Yet, he's able to prove himself the bravest and most clear-headed of the bunch.Yet, just because ""Krampus"" is rooted in dysfunctional family dynamics, that doesn't mean that it's not occasionally creepy, even downright scary. There are a number of sequences that are quite intense, and are a clear indication that ""Krampus"" is a ""PG-13""-rated Christmas-themed horror-comedy flick whose ""PG-13"" rating best be heeded beforehand.Along with movies like the aforementioned ""Gremlins"" and even ""Black Christmas"" (1974), ""Krampus"" is sure to join the ranks of those great Christmas-themed horror classics in due time.I think it's also quite obvious that a sequel is probably due out in a few, too...8/10",Krampus

61,drownnnsoda,Amusing? Yes. Ridiculous? You betcha.,6,26 December 2015,"""Krampus"" charts a Christmas holiday from hell for an upperclass suburban family. If the stress of holiday entertaining isn't enough, the family's youngest son inadvertently invokes an ancient Yuletide demon that turns a chaotic Christmas into one of death, destruction, and killer toys.I was somewhat puzzled by the premise of this film from the moment I saw the trailer, because I frankly just wasn't sure they could really pull it off in any meaningful way. Now having seen it, I think the answer is yes and no. What ""Krampus"" does well is play with Christmas atmosphere in a fun and remarkably energized way; the holiday theme bleeds through every scene, and the script does a nice job at highlighting the magical and simultaneously bizarre elements of the holiday that are sometimes utilized meaningfully and sometimes just there for fun. The film opens with a tongue-in-cheek montage of mad shoppers and in-store fights, which sets a satiric tone that is threaded through thematically. Where the film falls somewhat flat is its balance of raw comedy and horror. Horror and comedy can work very well together with proper measurement, but there seems to be near equal measure of both in the film that makes it a strange pill to swallow in many ways, and one almost gets the sense that the two genres are vying for the spotlight with the film as the battleground. The first thirty minutes or so are surprisingly atmospheric and funny, and even when things get extremely cartoonish (think ""Small Soldiers"" meets ""Christmas Vacation"" if it were a horror movie), there is still a playful sensibility about the film.The picture benefits greatly from having a cast of great comedic actors who help maintain a lightness about the film in spite of some of the darker elements within the script, but at the end of the day, it is a holiday film through-and-through, and it succeeds at being that. As a horror film or as a comedy, it is lacking proportionality, but by seasonal standards, ""Krampus"" is an amusing, absurd, and fantastical take on the darker side of Christmas mythology. 6/10.",Krampus
62,davispittman,Not what I expected.....,6,4 December 2015,"Krampus (2015) wasn't at all what I expected it to be. Not anywhere close to what I expected. I did not know it had some comedy involved in it, I just thought it was all 100% horror. The acting is all around pretty good. The special effects are well done as well. The look of Krampus and his minions were pretty good looking I thought. It really wasn't that scary at all though, the trailer was pretty misleading, it made it appear to be scary when it really wasn't, so that was kind of a disappointment to me. I found myself laughing in the theater at certain parts, I guess I was supposed to I don't know. The script and dialogue was just alright, nothing much to brag about. The effects and the designs of the crew creatures were cool and impressive looking. Some parts were just a little slow, but not too awful slow. I was not completely disappointed by Krampus, but I was a little let down. I just was expecting a much scarier film than what I received. So if you think you're going to get a really scary film based on watching the trailer, think again, that is NOT what you are getting. Also, I absolutely loved Aunt Dorothy, the actress that played her did soo well! Her character really did have some hilarious lines that she delivered wonderfully! 6/10.",Krampus
63,myriamlenys,not all that successful,3,6 January 2019,"I've got to admit that I find it hard to think of a target audience, since the movie is too scary and intense for children and too silly and predictable for older teenagers and adults. (If you're over 13 or 14 and if you're unable to predict the ending, or at least the general tone and message of the ending, feel free never to become an astronaut.)The movie is also much given to preaching, even when this is clearly inappropriate, as in the tale told by ""Omi"", the German grandmother. The tale is a short but accurate description of a community in ruins, probably as a result of war. Can you believe that there exist traumatized, malnourished, defeated humans who have given up hope ? And can you believe that there exist bone-tired children driven to distraction by the constant quarrelling of their parents ? Boo to all of these spoilsports ! Boo ! They should all be singing carols next to a roaring fireplace !Still, I would like to congratulate the people who designed and executed the various monsters. Many of these monsters were genuinely funny, disquieting or original, such as the malevolent gingerbread men. I get the feeling that these creations would do very well in, say, animation shorts about fairytales.",Krampus
64,peterp-450-298716,I know. I know. Christmas is far behind us already. Still wanted to see this horror.,5,14 April 2016,"""He's is always ragging on Christmas. He even told the first graders that Santa was just a cheap marketing ploy invented to sell Pepsi.""""Krampus"" was a movie I was really looking forward to. Partly because I picked up a radio report about a ban in some Austrian villages to use this folklore figure (I had never heard of it by the way) and his assistants. And partly because I was curious how a horror Christmas movie would look like. It's something different than the annual traditional Christmas junk we see on the tube. I was a little bit disappointed about this film, because the horror level is pitifully low. It was amusing though, on some level. Unfortunately it wasn't really the Krampus who predominated this movie, but rather his vicious little helpers. And those helpers really looked like dressed up villagers who just returned from a ""Krampus"" festivity in some tiny Austrian village. I'm just not sure yet whether Krampus has something to do with Santa Claus or Saint Nicholas.The first part of the movie was matchless. Those slow-motion images during the opening credits where a Christmas shopping frenzy is being portrayed. That fighting mass of buyers rolling over each other. The security guards using their stun guns. Salespersons tumbling from ladders. And fighting children during the Christmas recital. Brilliant although slightly exaggerated. But believe me, this is how I feel about the others during Christmas shopping. The most important person here is Max (Emjay Anthony), who still believes in Christmas. He's surrounded by his caring parents Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni ""Miss you already"" Collette), his older sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) and his Omi (Krista Stadler). The latter is a very cuddly grandmother and the personification of Christmas. Max has just one wish. He wishes that Christmas would be again like yesteryear. A cozy, warm family celebration, full of joy and affection. That wish is pretty much ruined the moment Sarah's sister shows up, with in her wake a moronic, antisocial family. A tactless guy, possessed by weapons. Two ludicrous daughters who look like solid quarterbacks and urinate while standing. A lazy, fat, stupid looking son whose only goal in life is to eat everything he can get his hands on. And as icing on the cake, an alcoholic, pedantic aunt. This colorful mixed bag of individuals are the cause of some chaotic situations, the moment they arrive there as an unwanted winter storm. The situation escalates completely after Max tears apart his Christmas letter with his wish written on. And that's the signal for Krampus to appear.This hilarious part was magnificent. Extremely funny, perhaps bland but hugely recognizable. I'm sure every family has a bunch of relatives like those of Max. What's intended to be a period of peacefulness, self-reflection and affection, sometimes ends up here and there in a family quarrel with old feuds being stirred up and feelings of jealousy taking the upper hand once again. The result is that there's hardly anything left of the traditional Christmas feeling. And that's why Krampus and his helpers show up. Not to reward anybody like Saint Nicholas or Santa Claus do. But to penalize those who don't believe in Christmas anymore.And that's where the horror starts or should start, because it isn't really creepy or frightening. Don't expect scary, gory scenes. It looks more like a Christmas version of ""Goosebumps"". The fact they made it in such a way, so young people could watch it too, probably has something to do with it. Although it's sometimes very exciting and thrilling. And the SE-department did a great job. The neighborhood which is turned into an icy landscape looks excellent. And the furious Krampus walking over the rooftops with the additional dismal sounds of rattling chains and ringing bells, looks also impressive. Only those creatures terrorizing the whole family, are just comical instead of terrifying. Krampus his imposing stature is seen repeatedly. Unfortunately we can only admire his phiz at the end. When talking about the comic-part of this movie, you can say it's kind of successful. But the horror is just like the Christmas spirit in this film, totally absent.

65,TheOneThatYouWanted,Joy to the world..,9,25 May 2017,"From the director of the upcoming Godzilla film! This was on my must-watch-list ever since it came out and I didn't get a chance to watch it. Looking back, I wish I watched this instead of rewatching Star Wars. I had to watch Star Wars twice because I did not like it the first time around and wanted to see why seemingly everyone loved. Fast forward a couple of years and people finally realize Episode Seven was a fail. I'm half tempted to skip Episode Eight and wait for it to come out on cable. Anyway. This is a very fun and original horror film and it does an outstanding job of mixing both practical and computer based effects. And the director does a great job of mixing the horror and comedy. So yeah, I'm glad he is directing the next Godzilla movie. Before ending this I need to say one thing; this is sort of a one-shot type of movie. Any sequels or prequels made in an attempt to establish a franchise will simply cheapen this film and I hope it never happens.",Krampus
66,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Christmas Horror,8,14 March 2019,"This was a film that I heard a lot about and had never gotten around to see it. Many of the podcasts I listen to always talked about how this is now in their Christmas horror film rotation. I decided this year to give it a try and get into the spirit myself. The official synopsis for this film is a boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a festive demon to his family home.We kick this film off what looks to be either Black Friday or people doing last minute Christmas shopping. Regardless, it shows one of things that I hate most about the Christmas holiday, how commercial it has become.The film then shifts to a family returning home. Our main character is Max (Emjay Anthony). He is actually being scolded by his parents, Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette). He got in a fight during a Christmas play. It turns out that Max still believes in Santa Claus despite his age. His grandmother, known as Omi (Krista Stadler) tries to cheer him up and tells him to write to Santa.This family is being joined by their cousins, aunts and uncle. Max has a sister, Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen). His uncle is Howard (David Koechner). His wife is Linda (Allison Tolman). They have four children, Howie, Jr. (Maverick Flack), Jordan (Queenie Samuel) and Stevie (Lolo Owen). The interesting thing about the last two is they are girls, but the father really wanted boys. They also have a baby. Their Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). No one is thrilled about her as she complains about everything and drinks a lot.During dinner, the two girls get the letter that Max wrote and start to read it. He is embarrassed and wishes that Christmas would go back to the way it used to be. He then throws the ripped up letter out of the window. We then see that it goes into the sky.The following morning, there is a horrible snowstorm and they can't see even across the street. The power and heat are off as well. Max notices a snowman outside that wasn't there before. Beth asks to go see her boyfriend, but when she doesn't return home, Tom and Howard go looking for her. They find something sinister that is stalking them as everyone on the street seems to be missing.I do want to lead off stating that this film is fun. If you haven't gathered, I'm not the biggest fan of Christmas, but something about this film I really liked. The concept of Krampus is something I find to be absolutely fascinating. Many of us grew up with Santa Claus and we had to be good in order to get presents. It is terrifying that if you are bad, there is an evil version that will come to take you away.What I find interesting about this film is that Krampus uses evil toys and elves as his minions. This gave me vibes of A Nightmare Before Christmas even though their toys unintentionally do bad things, because that is just how things were done in Halloweentown. The minions in this film are quite creative I have to say.Something that really turned me off to this film before seeing it was there being a lot of comedic actors. At the time this film came out, I wasn't the biggest fan of horror comedies. It is something that I have started to come around to, even though the crossover still isn't my favorite. I have to say, I was wrong, because the cast definitely enhances this film, not ruin it.Tthe pacing of the film is very well done. What I like about this film is that it does have lighter feel throughout, but it does get dark. There are some laughs that are sprinkled in, which is something I like if you are going to have comedy. This film does feel like a horror film for sure. There was a moment in it where I was going to get real angry if they decided to end a certain way. It ended up going the way I hoped it would, which is actually something I had heard on a podcast prior to watching this. It is funny to have the same reaction to this.Acting for this film I thought was great. Anthony is interesting as he is the main character, but he falls into the background for a good portion. A lot of that is he is a kid and the parents are trying to do what they can to protect them. Scott and Koechner are interesting as they are the exact opposite of each other. You have Scott who is more left in his ideology with Koechner being right wing. They end up coming to common ground to work together which I thought was good. Collette is solid as usual. I really like Stadler as the wise older person who give the background of what is happening. Owen doesn't have a big role, but I found her to quite cute. Ferrell was good for comedic relief and the rest of the cast round it out well for what they needed.Something else I found to be really good were the effects. I'm assuming there was a combination of practical and CGI, but they were done seamlessly for the most part. The look of Krampus himself was great. What I found interesting is we never get to see his face, as he is wearing a Santa mask. I was completely fine with this. The elves also looked good, as their masks were creepy as well. The toys were much of the same. The only thing I had an issue with is the living ginger bread men. They were a little bit too out there for my liking. This film was shot beautifully though and I liked the effect of the storm to really make the film much more claustrophobic.Now with that said, I thought this film was good and I'm kicking myself for not seeing it earlier. I love the concept of Krampus. It is even more interesting the minions that he brought along with him. It is an interesting perversion of Santa. I really only had issue with the living cookies from his group. The acting I thought was really good as were the effects. The editing and pacing were solid with a good ending. If you are a fan of the holidays and want to see a horror film that fits the spirit, I would recommend this one. I found this to be good.",Krampus
67,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Krampus,7,14 December 2015,"So is it true? Am I hearing this right? Did Universal Studios have the cojones to put out a comedy/horror/fantasy picture during the almighty silly season? Well good for them. I say bravo chap!Anyway let's face it. Everybody loves a good holiday film. Maybe it's Scrooge you fancy. Or maybe it's Elf. Maybe it's Home Alone. Heck, it could be Mixed Nuts for all I care (oy vey). Krampus (my latest review) is Christmas-themed but it also has horror movie interludes. This thing basically gives the middle finger to all concepts of yuletide cheer and goodwill towards men. Just throw in an element of Gremlins, a dash of Assault on Precinct 13, and Two and a Half Men's Conchata Ferrell for comic relief. That's Krampus for ya. In the words of flappable Tiny Tim, ""God bless us, every one!""Taking place amidst the present day and containing animation derived from one long flashback, Krampus the flick is about Krampus the horned, anthropomorphic figure. He (or she) punishes little kids who are disobedient and shout out that they hate Christmas. Max (played by Emjay Anthony) commits these offenses and much more. He also rips up a letter that he planned to give Santa Claus on the 24th. Next thing you know his family (consisting of actors/actresses Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and David Koechner) is terrorized by Krampus, his monstrous elves, and just about every ghoulish entity in sight (the image of snowmen outside dwelling windows still gives me the chills the more I think about it). Over the film's short running time, the skies in turn get grayer, the snowstorms get heavier, and no other humans are out and about. Basically the whole family is trapped in their Christmassy, East Coast home. Miracle of 34th Street becomes nightmare on residential street. Natch!Now Krampus with its bloodless violence and campy tone, is a movie that provides you with no mercy. It doesn't really frighten with jump scares or jolts. It's more about the demented images of monsters who relentlessly pursue the dysfunctional, suburban family spotlighted. Translation: Take heed if you're a parent because this 2015 release is not for the kiddies. With almost no build-up, fifteen minutes pass and you already know that chaos will rear it's ugly suture. Director Michael Dougherty provides the audience with a mixture of snarky dialogue and creature intake composed of snaggletoothed devils (masking as evil dolls). Add a ton of fake snow, howling winds, and icicles the size of Texas and you've got yourself a grim, almost totally original take on holiday, trepidation fare.In conclusion, I decided to look up all scary movies that take place on Christ's birth. There aren't a ton of them. With Black Christmas and Silent Night, Deadly Night being the only notables, it's safe to say that Krampus might turn into a December cult favorite. Only time will tell. My rating: 3 stars.Of note: (Spoiler alert) the ending to Krampus is mildly confusing in that you experience all 98 minutes of it and wonder if everything was just a bad dream. In hindsight, I suppose this was the right way to wrap things up. With the PG-13 rating presented, it's probably appropriate that every character didn't end up dying (chiefly the women and the children). In truth, the metaphors for this film really speak volumes. If you don't believe in the magic of holy day and adhere to the fine art of misbehaving, well the demons with claws aplenty are hastily coming to get ya. Make note on that!",Krampus
68,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A smart Christmas horror film,7,2 December 2016,"Everyone in the world may not celebrate it, but during December, many countries and cultures around the world celebrate Christmas. As heard through several mediums, it is the season of giving and being joyous. However it is important to note that this isn't the only time people should be merry with each other. The attitude should be carried out as much as possible; but this is far from the case. In various circumstances there have been incidents where people are not nice to each other. This is most commonly found among consumers in popular shopping malls or more relatably at home where family members must confront other members that just aren't worth it. These are norms that many people will not acknowledge or bother to recognize because many do not want to confront it. They are however apart of today's culture and things many people have to deal with. Of course there are also some that just want to escape it all, but be careful what you wish for. That is at least according to writer/director Michael Dougherty. Seeing he made such a cult classic with his Halloween holiday horror film Trick R' Treat (2007), it's no surprise he produced another holiday horror film except this time for Christmas. Written by Dougherty, Todd Casey and Zach Shields, the story follows Santa-believer Max Engel (Emjay Anthony), a boy trying to enjoy the holiday. Problem is everyone around him except his loving parents Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette) feel the exact opposite. When family members arrive and start annoying him, Max makes a wish for them to all go away. Little does he realize it would be his last wish he ever asked for. By doing this he has released the Christmas devil known as Krampus into his small neighborhood. Script wise the plot strikes a poignant note when it comes to morals. Overall, be grateful and don't wish for any harm because the end result may be far worse than what was wanted. The idea itself of Santa's shadow being heavily maniacal is ridiculous but nevertheless true when comparing it to karma.There are however some minor plot holes that don't make sense. When Krampus arrives, he also makes several other people vanish as well (very quickly). It's understandable that he is supernatural but his speed seems limited. Also there are some motivational contradictions for the holiday demon. When such creatures are summoned, most have a set of rules to follow but it seems as though Krampus doesn't or at least not consistently. Aside from this though, the acting is all done well by every cast member. Even the less important characters like Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen), Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell), Howard (David Koechner), Linda (Allison Tolman) and Grandma Omi (Krista Stadler) all have development in one way or another. And although this is a horror film, there are also several moments of comedic value to experience. Some of these occasions take place either when family members exchange certain lines or their reactions to preposterous situations. This is surprising considering the tone is more serious than comedic.As for horror, that's another gift in itself. Sadly the gore isn't as high as one would expect since Dougherty did make Trick R' Treat (2007), but believe it or not, it still works. There are several things to enjoy about the way Dougherty handles the movie. For much of the running time, Krampus is hidden in the background. The image of the creature itself is disturbing - with a hunchback, giant horns and rickety sounding joints. Adding to that is a bunch of other creative holiday ghouls that are just so ugly its amazing to see. The way it's presented is through a mix of CGI and practical effects but most of it looks practical. This is excellent because the degree of detail on these monsters look spectacular. Who knew such regular everyday items could be so hideous. Aside from the level of gore, the only other thing that may disappoint horror fans is the level of horror it takes its viewers. Perhaps this is because of its rating but it just isn't that scary. The horror and imagery is great but there's nothing to fear. Thankfully there aren't a lot of stings.Cinematography was another different experience thanks to Jules O'Loughlin. Rarely do horror films change their setting when it comes to execution. However this is different since it takes place in the middle of a snowstorm. How often does one think about the horrors of dying in the cold? O'Loughlin's skill also works very well with how the scenes are shot. Much of it has him capturing large amounts of the house's interior to show what's around. There are even some slow motion shots for comedic value. On a side note there's also a short stop-motion animated segment that is impressively put together as well. Kudos to that. As for music, Douglas Pipes' film score is another great audio effort. The composition is a mix of a few comedic and several horror cues that lift the main theme from classic Christmas songs. The difference is, Pipes puts them into a minor key. The score itself is well constructed with regular orchestra, Christmas bells, tribal drums, horns and church bells. A great sounding holiday horror score.Although it may miss a few exposition points when it comes to consistency, the overall product is a unique holiday horror film. Krampus is truly an iconic monster smartly brought to life with relatable writing, creepy monsters and fantastic music.",Krampus

70,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"""It's Christmas. Nothing bad is going to happen on Christmas!""",10,14 December 2015,"Krampus was a blast, one of the best films I've seen this year. Kind of like Home Alone, crossed with Gremlins, and Demonic Toys, a kid gets angry at his obnoxious family a couple of days before Christmas, says he hates them, which draws the attention of Krampus, a creature from Germanic lore, who punishes naughty kids on Christmas. The following morning, a blizzard traps the family, a la The Shining, and creepy looking snowmen mysteriously appear in their front yard, and as they venture out to seek help, all sorts of freaky creatures attack them, toys come to demonic life, Krampus stalks their rooftops, gingerbread cookies attack them (in one of the funniest, and simultaneously creepy moments in the movie) A dim, fat kid is lured by a doughnut on a string, hanging down from inside the chimney, and it works! This kid is so amusingly dim, the trick works, he is snatched up the chimney, via the fishing wire doughnut, to his implied death! And the scene works, it isn't ""so bad it's good"", it is genuinely funny and simultaneously horrific, in a Gremlins sort of way. The family is grumpy and kind of obnoxious at the start, but when all of these freaky things begin happening, they start to work together to save their asses. There is no Doubting Thomas in the bunch, they all accept and believe this is really happening to them, and that Krampus and his minions are trying to kill them- or is he? Several odd twists in the final moments seem to say it was a dream, possibly being collectively had by everyone in this family, as a warning of what might happen to them if they keep arguing, and show them they *can* get along with each other and work together, because Krampus is (implied to be) watching over them, still, in his snow globe, which is where the family apparently resides ... ! Weird and wacky, simultaneously scary and intentionally funny, one of my favourite films of 2015. The only part I didn't like was the final shot, a predictable jump scare, a cheap gimmick marring an otherwise brilliant horror comedy.",Krampus

72,brando647,Fun Christmas (PG-13) Horror From Director of Classic TRICK 'R TREAT,7,25 December 2016,"For those of us tired of the holly jolly holidays and the overwhelming happiness forced upon us this time of year, writer/director Michael Dougherty brings us KRAMPUS. If you're unfamiliar with Dougherty, you should start with his fantastic Halloween film from 2007, TRICK 'R TREAT. Once you realize TRICK 'R TREAT is an instant Halloween classic, set your sights a little lower and settle in for KRAMPUS. KRAMPUS is mostly fun but it just can't compete. Released in 2015 at the height of a Krampus craze that seemed to sweep the Internet, it's a PG-13 holiday horror film inspired by the legend of the creature that would arrive at the homes of naughty children on Christmas to beat them with sticks or steal them away to the underworld or something. Obviously I'm not well-read on the topic but I love the idea of an evil Christmas spirit. In the film, young Max (Emjay Anthony) and his family are settling in for Christmas with their obnoxious relatives. Max's youthful belief in Santa is challenged and the ridicule from his cousins leads him to tear up the letter he'd written to the North Pole in disgust. The destruction of this young child's belief awakens an ancient evil that arrives in the midst of a sudden blizzard to terrorize his family, picking them off one by one to drag them to Hell. Once he's conjured, Krampus and his Christmas minions are an unstoppable force who won't quit until the non-believers are punished accordingly.I want to hype KRAMPUS more but I have to be honest with myself that the movie isn't as great as I'd hoped it would be. There is about twenty-five minutes or so in the middle of the movie that are just awesome. Once the minions are unleashed in the house, everything goes nuts and you forget the movies lack of compelling characters for a while. It's all thanks to the sweet creature design. Krampus, who you don't see in any great detail until the end of the second act or so, looks amazing. He's designed as a sort of twisted St. Nick with the red robes and the jingle bells, except he's an otherworldly demon with hooved feet, long gnarled horns, and his face hidden behind a the mask of a hideously warped old man. And Krampus doesn't work alone; he's got his own little army of Christmas-themed freaks including dark elves, spastic gingerbread men, andmy personal favoritea man-eating Jack-in-the-Box with a face that splits like the Reapers from BLADE II. It's all done with practical effects: puppetry, animatronics, makeup and costuming. Everything except the gingerbread men is done in camera and I love it. It's something I wish more filmmakers would do in modern creature features. The segment of KRAMPUS where we get to watch these creatures go crazy in all their practical glory is really the best, and probably only, reason for me to recommend the movie. There isn't much else to get excited about in here.The first half hour of the movie establishes the characters but they're all so unlikeable that it isn't that much fun to watch. Adam Scott is Max's overworked father and Toni Collette is his overly-stressed mother trying to keep the holidays happy in spite of the family's constant in-fighting. His older sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) can't be bothered with Christmas and wants to spend time with her boyfriend. Then the cousins arrive and it gets worse. There's definitely some a bit of class warfare with David Koechner's conservative uncle Howard butting heads with the upper-middle class liberal nature of Max's parents and his kids are insufferable bullies toward Max from the moment they arrive. Then there's Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell from ""Two and a Half Men""), a stereotypical sassy drunk old maid type who grumbles sarcastically between spiked glasses of eggnog. Everyone is a pain except little old grandma Omi (Krista Stadler) who embraces the Christmas spirit and tries to keep Max's belief alive because she had her own experiences with disbelief and its consequences as a child. Omi is the only person who understands what's going on and the family would do wise to follow her lead. But they don't, so we get that awesome half hour of fun before the movie realizes it needs to hit that finish line and rushes through the last twenty minutes awfully fast considering how long the whole setup took. I might sound a little harsh on KRAMPUS at this point but keep in mind I still enjoy the movie and will fit it into my holiday watching routine and I recommend anyone searching for some Christmas counterprogramming to give it a watch. I just wish it had made the characters a little more sympathetic so we'd care more when they're taken.",Krampus
73,moviexclusive,"A refreshingly different Christmas movie, this horror comedy based on the ancient German folklore is an unassuming treat of wicked fun",6,3 December 2015,"Give credit to writer/ director Michael Dougherty for attempting a different breed of Christmas movie apart from the usual shtick of an extended family which puts aside its differences to come together in the spirit of the season. On the contrary, the particular household at the heart of 'Krampus' is, as a result of its dysfunctionality, visited by no less than demented little gingerbread men, terrifying Christmas clowns, evil elves and the titular horned, anthropomorphic figure who punishes those that have lost the Christmas spirit. Oh yes, though it may appear hooded like it were wearing a Santa hat, Krampus is no jolly old Saint Nicholas, but his very shadow – darker, more ancient and even more powerful.But to set the stage for Krampus' grand appearance, Dougherty spends a good half hour detailing the acrimony between the Engel family from the point of view of the young boy Max (Emjay Anthony). His parents, Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette), seem to have fallen out of love with each other of late, and his older sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) whom he used to hang out with now prefers to spend her time with her boyfriend who lives four blocks down from their house. Each Christmas sees their churlish Uncle Howard (David Koechner), Aunt Linda (Allison Tolman) and their intimidating twin girl cousins come to visit, a tradition not cherished but dreaded.Worse still, Aunt Linda has this year inadvertently brought along an even more annoying relative Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell), who lives in a trailer park and whom Sarah makes a deliberate point not to visit. It's a full house to say the very least, the meekest addition of all Max's German-speaking grandmother Omi (Krista Stadler) – and in case you're wondering, the old legend originated from German Alpine folklore, which is also how Omi gets the honours of explaining just who Krampus is to the rest of her uninitiated descendants. In fact, as the night wears on, Grandma Omi will reveal in a stop-motion flashback that she was ever visited by the feared creature as a young girl, who had taken her parents but spared her many, many years ago.At first, Max clings to hope that things in the family will get better this Christmas – that is, until his tomboyish twin cousins steal a letter he had addressed to Santa and embarrass him in front of everyone else at the dinner table. In sheer exasperation, he tears up the letter and declares that he has given up on Christmas, a proclamation that becomes an invitation for Krampus and his malevolent brood to come a-knocking as the sky turns black and a massive snowstorm besets their suburban neighbourhood. With the power out and no cellphone reception, a worried Beth gets her parents' permission to pay a visit to her boyfriend to see if he is OK, and her subsequent disappearance sets off a chain of events that will bring the entire clan face-to-face with the beast.As you may expect, Dougherty keeps the hooved creature in hiding until the last third of the film – and let's just say that when he is unveiled in his full glory, it isn't a pretty sight. In fact, none of the other mythical creatures are any less grotesque, and if every one of them appears vulgar, that is likely the very intent. There is nothing pretty about Krampus or his minions, nor for that matter do they have any other purpose than to instil fear and inflict pain – that explains why Sarah is beset by a demonic looking doll looking to chew her face off, while Howard is attacked by three vile little gingerbread men armed with a nail gun. The fact that Dougherty has kept the creature effects visibly crude is also tacit homage to its genre predecessors, most notably another Christmas- themed horror called 'Gremlins'.It is in that same spirit of wicked fun that Dougherty has crafted his freak show, and there are more than a couple of standout moments that will have you cheering in glee – among them, a couple contributed by no less than Howard's seemingly timid bulldog as well as the self-deprecating Aunt Dorothy. A somewhat messy finale aside, Dougherty deserves mention too for not resorting to the typical cop- out of a happily-ever-after ending – as much as some of the concluding scenes seem to give that impression – and sticking instead to his appreciably darker and ostensibly less sentimental vision of a Christmas (cautionary) tale. That consistency is in turn reciprocated by uniformly sharp performances by his ensemble cast, who play out their roles with dry wit and just the right hint of self-awareness.If it does feel like the mayhem is over too soon, that's because Dougherty spends the first hour in second gear before cranking the momentum all the way up to overdrive in the final act. That build-up does allow the characters to emerge with more texture than you would expect from a horror comedy like this, but it also does mean that fans of his similarly holiday-themed 'Trick R Treat' will find that 'Krampus' packs less frights on the whole. Frankly, we went in with little to zero expectation and found ourselves pleasantly surprised at how mischievously entertaining this subversive piece of Christmas candy was, and so if you're sick of Hollywood's usual holiday eggnog, this may just be that taste of naughty and nasty you're looking for.",Krampus
74,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Another wickedly entertaining horror-comedy from Michael Dougherty, ""Krampus"" is a great throwback to 80's cheese and holiday-horror classics like ""Gremlins""!",8,11 December 2015,"Ah, the horror-comedy. How I love thee.A sub-genre that is all too often dismissed, misunderstood or neglected altogether. Yet also a sub-genre that paves the way for some of the most wickedly entertaining and genre-bending classics of all time- just take a look at ""Gremlins"" or ""Evil Dead II"" for some of the finest examples of horror-comedy done right.And for this fan of horror and of horror-comedy, ""Krampus"" is definitely a wonderful new treat. Especially as, just like ""Gremlins"", it's not only a horror-comedy, but also a prime example of a holiday-themed horror-comedy done near-perfectly, save for a few issues here and there.Director Michael Dougherty is certainly no stranger to either sub- genre- his previous directorial effect (the excellent ""Trick 'R Treat"") also fit into both categories and is arguably the best Halloween- themed horror flick of the past several decades with its savage sense of humor and some genuine eerie thrills. So it's a lot of fun seeing him lend his unique sensibilities to a Christmas- themed film.The film focuses on a young, somewhat troubled boy named Max (Emjay Anthony) who is struggling with some Christmas-blues during the holiday season. He's just gotten into trouble for causing a fight, he worries that his parents (the wonderful Toni Collette and Adam Scott) are drifting apart and that he's similarly losing his friendship with his older sister (Stefania LaVie Owen)... and to top it off, he has to contend with his irritating extended family who have come to spend Christmas with he and his parents.After a disastrous diner, Max loses all faith in the holiday spirit, and tears up a letter he had written to Santa Claus, casting it out of the window, unaware that his actions will summon a dark force- the ""Shadow of Saint Nicholas""- ""Krampus."" Now, Max and his family (under the guidance of his elderly German grandmother played by Krista Sadler) will have to struggle against Krampus and his legions of demonic toys, killer-gingerbread-men and freakish devil- elves to survive.The success of the film really does fall back on Dougherty and his expert blending of both broad and specific types of humor in addition to a few genuinely creepy set-pieces, and the wonderful casting of the film that lends to all characters- even an irritatingly uber-conservative gun-nut uncle played by David Koechner (frankly a character you'd usually love to hate)- being inherently likable and enjoyable to root for as they deal with the onslaught of Christmas-chaos.There's also plenty of great callbacks to old-fashioned 80's cheese and wonderful old film standards of the holiday and holiday-horror genres, which give the film great character in and of itself. Particularly notable is an animated flashback sequence explaining the character of Krampus that is done in such a style to invoke notes and feelings of those old, schmatlzy Rankin-Bass stop-motion Christmas specials.Though despite how wonderfully entertaining and stylish the film often is, it does have a few issues. Even though it's only about 98 minutes, it does drag a bit in the first half (it honestly could have been trimmed down to an even 90 minutes and it probably would have flowed a lot better) and I do think the titular ""Krampus"" is held off on a bit too much until the final act. I know the classic cliché is ""don't show the monster too much"", but I think the film could have used another glimpse or two of him instead of relying so heavily on his freakish (and freakishly entertaining) ""minions"" as often as it does.I also will say that this is definitely a horror-comedy through-and- through, which I don't think was illustrated properly in the marketing. So be aware of this going in... because I'm sure there will be some audiences who are unaware of this, or just don't enjoy or understand the horror-comedy sub-genre, and may emerge disappointed that it wasn't just a straight-forward horror film.But regardless of that, I honestly can't say enough to recommend this film to horror fans, and ESPECIALLY to horror-comedy fans. It has a few kinks that could have been worked out, but they are just small chips in an otherwise exceedingly enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining ride to Holiday-Hell!I give ""Krampus"" a very-good 8 out of 10. It's not for everyone, and people who aren't fans of films that blend genres will probably not enjoy it, but open minded audiences and genre fans should eat this up! It's definitely joining ""Gremlins"" and ""Die Hard"" on my list of ""Must-Watch Alternative Christmas Films"" that I view every year!",Krampus
75,quincytheodore,What I want for Christmas is jolly scare and merry satire.,7,14 December 2015,"Krampus opens up with nice ironic Christmas tradition of fighting random strangers to get discounted stuffs, it's a pleasant reminder of the annual Arnold's survival movie for Turbo Man. It already gets the holiday spirit right already, then it slowly adds some creepy version of fat man and toys. This is pretty far from legitimate haunting flick, but just like a decent enough present viewers would be content with its mix of comedy and horror.The first act is a jab towards silly tradition with overly unlikeable relatives, just like the jerks on Home Alone. Admittedly, they encapsulate this struggle very well with satire on visual and music, juvenile banter and even perverted mall Santa Claus who stares at the teenage girl's butt. I almost forgot this was meant to be partial horror and was quite absorbed in the comedy.They sure make the relatives characters unsympathetic with nasty manner, perhaps even a tad exaggerated. The main family, in contrast, is a better on-screen characters, especially the two cynical children. Max is the quintessential disappointed kid who audience would like to cheer due sheer innocence vibe and Beth, his sister who is caught in one of the most frightening scenes in the movie, and not the pervy Santa.Its other horror aspect is unfortunately could be better. There are a couple of chilling instances while the rest are utilized more for comedy. At some points the cinematography plays with color tone and lighting so well, even capturing the ominous sighting in grand fashion. It has ample of gore for horror fans, and its twisted designs for the creatures are quite fascinatingly appalling.However, it loses the magical steam about mid-way, it simply can't keep the same level of wit or revulsion from early on. The movie might not be intended as full-fledged horror, but it feels like a missed opportunity since there are some highlights that could've been legitimate scary moments. On the side note, the caricature visual used to create the flashback scene is pretty amusing and it adds depth to the mythology.Krampus may not bring the ultimate gift for horror, but it delivers presentable delight with strangely compatible satire and a welcomed unconventional holiday atmosphere.",Krampus

They didn't take themselves too seriously and had fun with it. It's very reminiscent of the cheesy horror movies from the 80's and 90's. In a way, this movie comes close to 'Gremlins' This review will contain some spoilers. I loved the opening scene. It gives you a feel of Black Friday and how crazy some people actually get. The beginning really felt like Christmas like the family banter, the decorations, and making Christmas cookies while watching a Christmas movie. Our main character is a young boy named Max who wants Christmas to be like it was in the old days. He gets aggravated when his mom's side of the family come and one of the kids reads aloud the letter he wrote to Santa. He becomes angry and tears the letter into pieces, which causes the Krampus to soon show up and spread some holiday fear. The Krampus was very cool and creepy looking. They don't show him too often, but they make up for it with his demonic toys, sadistic elves, and adorably possessed gingerbread men. It's up to Max to stop Krampus and save Christmas. If you love Christmas and horror comedies, I highly recommend KRAMPUS!!!",Krampus

When their son tore his letter to Santa Claus and threw it away from the window, the storm clouds gathered and the howling blizzard brought Krampus and his elves and the toys came to life along with Christmas cookies. The german grandmother kept telling they should feed the fire at the fireplace because it keeps them away. Their daughter wanted to check his boyfriend and became the first victim to krampus. The fathers went out to look for her and Howard got attacked from beneath the snow by something like a creature in tremors and the scot boy saved him. Howard kept the first watch but fell asleep and the fire went out and they took his fat son from the chimney. The girls were lured up into the attic and the toys that were possessed fighting the humans were really hilarious. The clown puppet, the chucky's bride doll with wings and a robot with a knife. And Howard got attacked by Christmas cookies and the dog ate one of them and saved Howard. They wanted to drive away with the plowing truck. The grandmother locked herself in and wanted to face it as she summoned it back in war torn Germany. It took her and the adults were all suck into the ground by the tremor thing. Minions took the last girl and the gate to hell opened in the ground. No matter how hard he asked for everything to be reversed, both were thrown into lavas. He woke up in the Christmas morning and all seemed normal except for his present was the sleigh bell of krampus as a reminder of what happens when Christmas spirit is lost. They were trapped in a snow globe and Krampus put it away on a shelf next to other snow globes. Krampus looked really good with the evil face of Santa Claus and a body of a crooked giant goat.",Krampus

The scares are few and far between and the humour is almost entirely in the last quarter of the film. So much so that, when I finally laughed, it was a handy reminder that this is a comedy movie - I'd forgotten.This isn't a particularly bad film, it's okay as a mystery drama, which is exactly what it is for the first three quarters. Then it takes a humorous turn, but by then it's just too little, too late.'Krampus' can't seem to decide what it wants to be. It had the potential to be a scary and funny film, but falls short on both counts.Overall, not what I expected or had hoped for. 'Krampus' has too few scares and not enough laughs.",Krampus

The film looks like it is going to turn into a survival horror (I was hoping for Gremlins type deal) but it is really only two short sequences.The family is hideously out gunned making it depressing rather than tense and the films plot becomes a tangled mess. It doesn't really have anything to say which is strange for a Xmas movie - but maybe not for a horror.The main problem I had was this is scary in places, but not scary enough, or funny enough, or pretty enough, or jumpy enough, or endearing enough, or anything enough.The movie covers all bases but only half heartedly. I went to the cinema, I will probably fall asleep to it next year on DVD. Not a terrible movie just very flat and a bit dull.",Krampus
82,one9eighty,Underappreciated cult classic which surely has to become a yearly tradition,8,31 January 2019,"When families are forced to spend time together in close proximity at Christmas things often go wrong. People argue and tempers fray. Imagine then, if a Bavarian Christmas demon attacks your neighbourhood because he has been summoned due to the gloom emanating from your family.Michael Dougherty directs this 2015 comedy, fantasy, horror film which is destined to live on yearly as a Christmas film for late night viewing. Featuring a great cast and some really authentic horror action this film has been under-valued due to the Christmas film it is decorated with. It reminds me of a good old fashioned 80's and 90's horror film - think ""Gremlins"", ""Evil Dead"", and ""Tales from the Crypt"" - even away from horror, there were times it felt like this was all happening on the same street as ""Home Alone"" was unfolding.I expected this film to be a b-movie 'bad but good' film which was entertaining enough for me to like it - this surpassed that and I actually loved this film. The action was great, the practical effects were top notch, the spare CGI worked really well, the plot and script were convincing too. While labelled as a horror film, you don't get the cliché horror that you'd see in modern films, no overuse of fake blood and gore, no over the top R-rated violence and language, no scares just for the sake of making the audience jump. Instead this is a well crafter family horror, if there is such a film - something I'd be happy watching with my retired parents, or with some of my older nephews. It's actually a refreshing change to see this level of care applied to a film - but admittedly, this might not make everyone as happy as it did me. For me this really did feel like a family horror film with all the heart and messages of a good Christmas film too.I'm giving this film 8 out of 10. I am more than positive that this will be watched every Christmas hence forth. Enjoy!",Krampus
83,meddlecore,Children's Horror About Christmas Anxiety And Losing Faith,6,15 December 2016,"Krampus is a children's horror about Christmas anxiety and losing faith...that is certain to scare the crap out of your kids.While not particularly gory, or anything...the monsters are all pretty badass. Some are CGI-rendered, but most utilize real fx in a very convincing fashion, that will genuinely terrify pre-pubescents.And there is just enough action and violence to keep the adult crowd entertained, as well. Giving it a nice balance, without making it too hardcore for young viewers.Storywise, we follow a family who is starting to lose faith in the magic of the holiday season, as their children begin to approach puberty.These anxieties seem to have triggered the resurrection of Krampus; a demonic Christmas entity, and his legion...who are hellbent on taking everyone out, one-by-one.The family must overcome their differences and disagreements, if they are to defeat these demons...and/or simply make it through the night.There is a final twist- which is a bit cliché- but it works for a film that is marketed towards children. In the end, Krampus isn't such a bad little film. The monster fx are seriously awesome (when not reliant upon CGI). Which, from an adult perspective, is it's most redeeming aspect. However, if you are looking to scare the sh*t out of your kids for Christmas this year (as all good parents should!)...then this is definitely the film you should turn to.6 out of 10.",Krampus
84,RforFilm,"You better watch out! Krampus brings a good blend of scares, laughs, and even holiday spirit",7,17 December 2015,"When most people think of holidays and the horror genre, they immediately think that they don't go together. While I myself don't care for horror movies around the Christmas season, only wanting to embrace the happiness around the colors and decorations, I can understand that there is a darkness hiding around this time. Christmas time means getting together with the family and friends you've grown accustomed to, but it also means a lot of talking. It will be around this time that much of these conversations will revolve around issues you'd rather not talk about in a normal dialogue. Add that along with tension among relatives you may not get a long with, it can be easy to lose the holiday spirit as anger clouds the mind in favor of resolving your own problems without addressing someone else's. I've had my fair share of trouble around the holidays, arranged from death around that time to a friend making an announcement that shocks everyone. My strategy is to let the other party have their day and tell them that the kind of business they want to indulge in should be reserved for the next year. A whole family faces their troubles with the help of a demonic monster in Krampus. After a hilarious slow motion opening showing the madness of shoppers around the holidays, Max is scolded by his parents Tom (played by Adam Scott), Sarah (played by Toni Collette), and his sister Beth for ruining a Christmas pageant for starting a fight over Santa Claus. A disobedient son is the least of their worries as Sarah's sister's family is soon arriving for Christmas. Though the family knows that the relatives are hard to deal with, Max does his best to keep a positive attitude around the festive season, hoping that he can still have a nice Christmas. Sarah's Sister Linda (played by Allison Tolman), husband Howard (played by David Koechner) and their children Stevie, Jordan, Howie Jr., and their baby daughter, along with an older aunt Dorothy (played by Conchata Ferrell) all arrive and have barley anything positive to say. The tension run so high that after Howards kid's openly read's Max's letter to Santa, young Max tears his letter, feeling that Christmastime is a shame.This causes an immediate snowstorm to knock the power out and block all roads, leaving the neighborhood totally enclosed in blinding white snow. As they start to hear and see strange things, the family is told about the monster coming instead of Saint Nicholas, Krampus.Krampus could have been an easy straight up horror movie, but its smart enough to take inspiration from Gremlins to add plenty of dark humor. Much of the jokes not only come from the personalities of the family, but also of the creatures that come in for the attack. I guess I would have liked a little more, say something like Evil Dead 2 that had a nice blend of horror and comedy. This seems to be more focused on the dark stuff as it defiantly has a scary atmosphere (surprising for a PG-13 movie).Krampus is also intelligent enough to know that it is a Christmas movie. Scares are the focus, but story wise, it's always about two things; the monster and the background on why it goes after those that don't have the holiday spirit (as told through a nicely touched stop motion scene) and the conflicts of the family and how they resolve them. In a way, Krampus has A Christmas Carol feel to it, especially with how the story ends. I won't spoil it, but it ends enough to make a good blend of holidays and scares.I'll give this seven Krampus monsters out of ten. While it's not as laugh out loud funny as I would have liked, it makes it up with some creepy monsters and a surprisingly sentimental story. If you don't want any horror madness around the holiday season, then you're not going to like it. If the mood strikes for something different from your Christmas Vacation or Christmas Story, then Krampus may be a welcome down your chimney.",Krampus
85,cultfilmfan,Krampus,9,5 December 2015,"Krampus, was a film that really peaked my interest the more I read about it online. I finally then saw the trailer for the film and it looked like it would prove to be a fun night out at the theatre. I also read from other viewer's who saw director Michael Dougherty's previous film Trick 'R Treat, and most online reviews I read said what an impressive modern day horror film that was and if done in the same way and using the same talent that he did for Trick 'R Treat, then potentially Krampus, could prove to be another horror hit for the genre and for Dougherty as a director. If, I had to be honest about it, I would have to admit that I choose what I review for this site and decide to see at the theatre very carefully and what types of reviews a film gets will usually play largely in my decision to see that film, or not. This week when I knew Krampus would be released, I scoured the internet online to find reviews for the film to decide whether to spend ten dollars to go and see it at the theatre, or perhaps not if it was a poorly reviewed, or made film and not worth my time. I was getting concerned because in the week of it's release, the film was supposed to be released on Friday, and yet here we were on Thursday morning and there were no critics reviews for the film whatsoever. Normally this is not a good sign because normally when a film is not screened for critics you know immediately that you have a dog of a film on your hands and that is why the film studio decided not to screen it for critics, to further save them (the studios) some money from a film that they are most likely already going to lose money on and the negative reviews if they were published would certainly not help things. Finally on Thursday afternoon, reviews starting to come in and thankfully most of them were positive. By the time I got home from work on Thursday night, most if not all of the reviews for the film were available and they were pretty decent reviews for a film of this type. Seeing as you are reading this page, you would already know that I listened to the reviews and went out and decided to see Krampus, and I am sure glad that I did. The first maybe 20 minutes, or so of the film were getting on my nerves as the film was playing out mostly as a comedy and I found the extended family and relatives of the main characters in the film to be obnoxious, annoying and the humour that was used tended to be obvious and fall flat in the humour department. I hoped the rest of the film was not like this and thankfully it wasn't. Once the whole horror aspect and theme of the film took over, I was enjoying the film thoroughly. Humour would still be thrown in here and there, but it tended to have a better feel and flow to it set against the horror backdrop of the story. The film this most reminded me of was Joe Dante's film Gremlins, from the 1980's and in a sense I think that is what Dougherty and his crew were aiming for. The special effects in the film are underplayed in the sense that they do not go overboard with them and they use a nice mix of both computer and natural effects that looks beautiful here yet creative and pleasing to the eye at the same time. The villains in this film tended to be larger than life and were more menacing and mischievous than bloodthirsty, or gruesome as was true to the original Gremlins as well. The film brilliantly combines a film with a Christmas time setting and combining humour (which works a lot better later in the film) as well as horror and fantasy. The film is completely fun and entertaining as soon as the horror element kicks in and whatever one says about this film, they certainly can't say that it was boring. The visual effects, lighting and cinematography are all beautifully done here and give the film a sharp and pleasing look and yet conveying a scary and dull wintry backdrop at the same time. The characters also grow on you and you have a lot of fun with them trying to save themselves from these various monsters. Krampus, is as many have already said, bound to go down as a cult classic and would work well as an annual Christmas time watch as well. This is one of the most original and interesting films of the year and probably the most fun as well. The violence is also on the low side which works well for the film and should be suitable for larger audiences other than strictly adults. A fun time to be had by all.",Krampus
86,dave-mcclain,"""Krampus"" does a disservice to a very good story with unlikeable, non-sensical characters.",4,4 December 2015,"Pay close attention. Your future depends on it especially if you're a real Movie Fan. If you are, you need to know about the character of Krampus, for reasons that will soon become clear. The Krampus legend is a product of 16th century Alpine-area folklore – especially in Germany and Austria (even though certain aspects of the character may come from the pre-Christian era). Krampus is a horned creature who is a counter-balance to Saint Nicholas, much as Satan is to God. Saint Nicholas rewards, while Krampus punishes. Saint Nicholas gives. Krampus takes. While Santa Claus (the American version of Saint Nicholas) gives presents to good children and leaves lumps of coal for bad kids, Krampus does Saint Nicholas' dirty work for him. Krampus takes away children who behave badly or, worst of all, have lost faith in Christmas entirely. The Krampus character has played an increasing role in Europe's holiday season celebrations in recent decades and has more recently started to become somewhat of a thing in North America. And, naturally following on the heels of that development, is a more prominent role in our popular culture. The horror comedy ""Krampus"" (PG-13, 1:38) is 2015's most high-profile (but not its only) cinematic embodiment of the legendary character, and is, in fact, part of a growing trend.Tom and Sarah (Adam Scott and Toni Colette) have an upper middle-class suburban family living in an unnamed city, likely in the Midwest. They have a typically selfish and moody teenage daughter named Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) and a young(ish) son named Max (Emjay Anthony) who still believes in Santa. Also living in the house is Tom's elderly German-speaking mother (Krista Stadler), whom the kids call Omi. This Christmas, Tom and Sarah are hosting their extended family, including Sarah's sister, Linda (Allison Tolman), her gun-toting husband, Howard (David Koechner), and their kids - teenage tomboys, Stevie (Lolo Owen) and Jordan (Queenie Samuel), younger son, Howie Junior (Maverick Flack), and baby girl. Tagging along is Sarah and Linda's rude Aunt Dorothy (Conchatta Ferrell). Soon to follow is another unexpected guest, the titular evil spirit (played in body by Luke Hawker and in voice by Gideon Emery).The movie's first act is all about setting the stage for the mayhem that is to come. The movie opens with a funny, but random and awkwardly-staged slow motion Black Friday-type scene, set to Bing Crosby's joyous rendition of ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"". Then we get a kids' Christmas play gone awry (also in slo-mo), and serviceable, but disposable, character development which turns obnoxious when Linda and Howard show up with their clan. The major scene in that section of the movie is an impressive, but unappreciated holiday meal on the night of December 22nd. During that dinner Stevie and Jordan steal, read aloud and mock Max's recently completed letter to Santa (while the adults at the table basically do nothing). This culminates in Max screaming that he hates his family, a moment reminiscent of Kevin McAllister dissing his clan in ""Home Alone"" 25 years earlier, but with a much darker result than Kevin's morning-after surprised, but happy proclamation of ""I made my family disappear"".It's when Max retrieves and rips up his letter and then tosses it out the window and into an ominous cold updraft of wind that the movie finally gets interesting. In short order, a very nasty winter storm robs the house of its electricity, cell phone and LAN line services and also seemingly robs the neighborhood of all signs of life, while depositing a creepy snow man on the family's lawn. Then, Tom and Sarah inexplicably let Beth out of the house alone to walk the four blocks to check on her boyfriend. When it gets dark and Beth hasn't returned, Tom and Howard go looking for her. During their brief outing, they battle some of the evil minions that are Krampus' helpers, barely making it back home.Strange things start happening around the house and Omi decides to tell the family what's happening. She relates the story of her own family's encounter with Krampus when she was a little girl and advises the others to ""keep the fire hot"". Apparently, a well-stoked fire will keep the evil at bay, at least for the members of the Krampus crew who like to climb down the chimney. But when the house where you are holed up has a big, spooky attic, you don't think twice about bringing in a large and dirty sack of gifts that just appears on the porch, and no one can stay awake long enough to throw another log on the fire or complete his guard shift in front of the boarded up windows well, evil will manage to find its way in.Krampus is a great character around which to build stories. It's too bad that ""Krampus"" isn't a better movie. First of all, you could skip the film's first 35 minutes (which I actually suggest you do), while missing nothing of importance, and sparing yourself some poorly-written, poorly-directed, poorly-acted scenes. The rest of the movie features poorly-cast actors, but the performances improve when Krampus and his pals show up. The evil spirits and the objects that they possess are cheaply portrayed and those scenes feature an overuse of tight and shaky cinematography, but the horror and horror-comedy aspects of the film still work pretty well and the ending is very well-done. More Krampus-themed movies are indeed in the pipeline. Meanwhile, if horror comedies and/or evil central European holiday characters are your thing, you just might enjoy ""Krampus"". While judging the film to be something of a mixed bag (like to the title character's sack of ""gifts""), I did enjoy parts of the film, but only enough to give it a ""C+"", a little short of a recommendation.",Krampus

I'm not going to go into why St. Nicholas has so many different names but I'm simply going to explain for the premise of the film and story.Krampus has been used for centuries to remind children to be good or it won't be St. Nicholas who visits it will be Krampus, who doesn't give but takes.In essence this is a silly horror comedy film and they knew it when making it adding extra layers of Christmas cheese to the mix to create a few lough out loud moments and I don't usually like comedy horrors but I loved this alternative take on Christmas, from the killer gingerbread men to the Christmas lawn decorations.Brilliant alternative take on Christmas but actually reinforced the message and meaning of Christmas not through some sloppy story but one I actually enjoyed.You'll either love this one or hate it.Rating 9 out of 10",Krampus
89,Sir_AmirSyarif,A Christmas scare that offers tons of fun for the audience,7,24 December 2020,"Sags a bit in the middle but Michael Dougherty's Christmas scare, 'Krampus,' still offers tons of fun for the audience. It's both lighthearted and funny but also surprisingly horrifying. The movie features strong acting all around with leads Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and David Koechner providing wonderful performances. 'Krampus' also features a wealth of fantastic effects, from the evil toys, to the elves, and especially Krampus himself. There is no lack of great creature effects.",Krampus
90,Seth_Rogue_One,Krampus? More like Krappus,3,14 April 2016,"Starts out with 20 minutes of genuinely unfunny 'comedy' (I use that term lightly when it comes to this movie) then gets more promising as it manage to create a somewhat spooky atmosphere but just when you think they are gonna get it right they ruin it.Michael Dougherty attempts at recreate what made 'Trick R Treat' a hit which basically means put in as many different baddies as possible and hope that people will feel that they got their 'bang... or maybe better worded 'boo for their buck' at least and that that will be enough.But it's not... Really not, no matter how many deadly gingerbread men or killer dolls you throw in... He even hired a chubby kid that looks just like the chubby kid in 'Trick R Treat', which is hardly a coincidence.Maybe it's time to learn a new trick?A shame to see Toni Collette waste her talent on this crap.",Krampus
91,MattyGibbs,Very enjoyable Christmas Horror-Comedy,9,2 December 2016,A family are besieged in their home by a number of Christmas spirits in the run up to Christmas. This is a film very much along the lines of Gremlins and a very welcome change from a lot of modern horrors. This is beautifully filmed and although not gory there are plenty of horror elements on show here. There is a great atmosphere created throughout the film and there is some decent humour thrown into the mix. The casting is great with not a duff performance on show. The creations are brilliantly done and quite creepy. This is a film that's great to look at and a huge success as far as I'm concerned. The ending is also wonderfully ambiguous. A real Christmas treat.,Krampus
92,nathanmanson,I feel violated,2,22 September 2020,"That was god awful. I didn't laugh or get scared once during the film, I just sat there in pure silence for an hour and a half. The story line made no sense and the kids acting was shocking. Bad acting, bad story line, bad film, BAD!",Krampus

94,CANpatbuck3664,"Not Very Scary, But a Solid Family Holiday Horror Movie Nonetheless",7,12 December 2015,"A good holiday movie is hard to find. There are the classics (It's A Wonderful Life, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, even The Santa Clause depending on your taste) but there have been few made lately. While it would be hard for me to recommend this movie for the whole family (definitely not young children), if you're looking for something a little off the beaten path to pass the time, Krampus might just fill that need.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After a montage of the worst possible holiday experience at a department store, we are introduced to our main family with the main character being Max (Enjay Anthony) who despite being a little too old for things like Santa, he is trying to keep the holiday spirit alive. It is December 22 and his extended family is coming and he's looking for a little quality time with his closest family, watching Charlie Brown and baking Xmas cookies. The only one supporting him is his grandma Omi (Krista Sadler), his parents Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette) and his sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) are all more preoccupied with themselves, all yammering about how unpleasant the visit will be. The extended family eventually arrives, they are ungrateful and frankly rude led by Linda (Allison Tolman) and Howard (David Koechner) and their kids Stevie (Lolo Owen), Jordan (Queenie Samuel) and Howie Jr. (Maverick Flack). As a surprise they also bring along Sarah and Linda's nasty aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). The atmosphere at the dinner is unpleasant and after an incident involving a pretty touching letter to Santa from Max, Stevie and Jordan decide to read it at the table for fun, the evening turns sour. Max becomes angry and while his dad tries to comfort him, he loses faith and rips up his letter to Santa which is sucked up into the sky. Soon a very unpredictable storm roles in and with it the titular villain Krampus to punish the family for their disrespect of the Christmas spirit.To start off, for you holiday cynics out there, if you feel like the Christmas spirit no longer exists and the holiday isn't worth celebrating because of all the commercialism out there, the first 5 minutes of Krampus should have you in stitches. You get a montage of some truly awful holiday behaviour. It's slightly exaggerated but there is some truth to it and I was laughing throughout.One of the things that Krampus does that you don't always see is that it makes an effort to set up its characters as you get probably a half hour without the impending monster that will later dominate the film. Our protagonist Max is a good kid, he's trying to make the best of having to be around his a&&*^$% extended family and even when his actions summon Krampus, I couldn't blame him. The rest of Max's immediate family are relatively understandable, minus the Grandma they all have warts in their personalities but they seem closer to an average family. While I'm not going to blame the actors playing their parts, the writing about his extended family walks the line between realistic and downright cartoonish. Max's aunt and uncle and their children all just varying degrees of annoying and unlikable, especially Max's two female cousins. Still, this extra development serves the movie well ultimately, I saw it as an unexpected positive, some effort from the creative team that isn't always present in other movies.Something else that was unexpectedly beautiful was the animation scene explaining the grandma's back story. She has encountered Krampus before and her story is told through an animation sequence that reminded me of Coraline. Is it necessarily consistent with the rest of the movie? No, but it is vibrant and it helps pick the movie up in one of it's slower periods.The acting in the feature is solid. I don't know if there are any stand out performances but it is an ensemble, the group definitely does their job. Adam Scott, Toni Collette, David Koechner and Allison Tollman are all good as the 4 parents. They all do good work with the material they are given. Emjay Anthony also performs well but while he is the protagonist, he is the main character at the start of the film but the focus moves more toward the family as a whole so he's more relegated to the background. Otherwise I didn't find a weak link in the cast.Getting down to the heart of it though, Krampus as a film is classified as a horror/comedy. I think the movie is definitely funny and it never drags. But on the flip side is the movie scary? I didn't think so. It is tense and I admired the creativity of the monsters and the creatures that Michael Dougherty and his crew created but it wasn't terribly frightening. I was laughing more at the horror aspects than I was screaming. If you showed this movie to an older kid or a young teenager, I think horror wise this would be more their speed. But as an adult, Krampus is definitely not one of the scarier movies out there.So, while the movie isn't terribly scary and the horror and comedy parts don't always mesh together well, it is fun. It's very much a throwback to Christmas family comedies and Krampus is enjoyable on that level. It's laughably weird in bits and I have to give them credit for not giving into a crowd pleasing ending. It seems a little deep for this feature but it's interesting and if you see Krampus with someone else, there will be a discussion about it. I can't recommend it to everyone, if you're rolling your eyes at the premise, I doubt the movie will change your mind. But if you're in the mood for something a little more obscure to watch while the weather outside is frightful, you could do a lot worse than this.",Krampus
95,SquigglyCrunch,Great Monsters and Often Dumb Characters,8,15 December 2016,"Krampus follows a family who loses the spirit of Christmas and is attacked by anti-Santa Claus. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a lot of fun to watch. If you go into it knowing that it takes some time to get going, you'll probably be able to enjoy it more than if you expected constant fast-paced action. As such, the pacing is pretty good. The movie takes place almost entirely in one house, and it creates a great atmosphere for the movie to settle into. The special are almost all fantastic. It's all practical, save for a few little things (which don't look as good). It's amazing to think that they made, and own, actual props of most all the monsters in the movie. They're all pretty creepy, and the fact that a prop like that exists somewhere in the world just makes it slightly more frightening. On that note, all the monsters look great, not just in terms of special effects, but design-wise too. The monsters are often visually creepy, and I absolutely loved each one. Unfortunately the characters are, while comedic and often a lot of fun, pretty dumb from time to time. Specifically towards the end they make some really stupid decisions that could have made their lives just that much easier if they bothered to use their heads a little. The ending isn't great. I think that if the last minute or so had been shaved it off it would have been better, although I liked how the final cut of the end was done regardless. It has redeeming qualities, but it's not as ballsy as it could have been. It was done to appeal to a wider audience, and I get it, but it doesn't necessarily make it better. Overall I had a great time with Krampus. Save for some aspects towards the end, it was a great time. It's far from great, and I'd hesitate to call it good based on the actual quality of the film, but I still enjoyed it a lot. This is definitely a movie I plan to see every Christmas and in the end I would definitely recommend it.",Krampus

It is HORRIBLE it is not FUNNY, SCARY, IT IS PRETTY BORING I FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.
Acting in this film was also really bad. They even looked BORED.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS 💩.",Krampus
97,billygoat1071,Festive Horror,8,6 December 2015,"Krampus tends to be a twisted version of classic family Christmas movies, like if the McCallisters were being haunted by the Austrian myth which is the shadow of St. Nicholas and some Gremlins-like creatures that are made of cookies and other Christmas-related stuff. The real appeal of the film is it's trying to be a campy horror film in a time of Christmas, where we see creepy practical effect monsters, designed with the festivity of the holidays. At that point, it's all pretty fun. And thematically, the movie does stick with the spirit of the season. While it's nothing groundbreaking to both horror and Christmas movie standards, it's still an enjoyable dose with these two elements coming together in a delightful while.The movie opens showing how Christmas is no longer about what it used to be. People rushing into stores for the holiday sale and while it's as silly as it looks, it's also a sad image of how the spirit of the season has fallen apart by commercialism and other sorts. The story centers a young boy who wants to spend Christmas in a less bitter way than what he is usually having lately with his family. And their attitude leads to a consequence of having the legendary creature punishing them for forgetting what the holiday is about. With its arc, it's just perfectly engaging, as it goes to clever directions, especially when the lights finally go out for the antagonists to scare, how the characters grow into sympathy with each other actually felt natural for its shift of heart.For its horror, it's just downright enjoyable. Yeah, horror fans might be asking for more gore, but to what it is, the craft on how the monsters attack is clever and just excitingly frightful. While Krampus himself is creepy enough without looking at his face, there's also a giant jack-in-the-box that eats children, some sentient gingerbread men and a number of demonized Christmas stuff. The movie is basically just having a blast of making these evil beings mess around, although they don't appear much until the second half, but the film makes the most out of these monsters, which is mostly the holiday treat we expected.Again, the appeal of this movie is how mostly practical the effects are; showcasing these puppetry and costumes with its grotesque and diabolical details manifesting the terror of these monsters. There is still use of CGI when it's needed, it never kept it from its twisted nature and just let these craziness run wild. The acting is also quite natural for a movie that goes over-the-top about its own cynical view towards modern- day Christmas. The moment between the kid, Max, and his dad, though only little, is quite charming to watch, so is the relationship of his parents at their smaller moments. The other characters are meant to be obnoxious, but they manage to get that away for how they change into this journey of Holiday misery.Even without the horror, Krampus is already an engaging film. But the horror is so fun, it's just worth the payoff, well maybe not most of the audience. Yeah, the movie isn't too scary or violent for the horror fans to love it entirely. But again, maybe as an adventurous Christmas special with a good amount of twisted imagery, the movie works well enough. It sticks to the spirit of the season, while also sticking to its 80s-like monster movie roots. It's just the right film to unconventionally celebrate the holidays.",Krampus
98,bregund,Poor writing,2,7 October 2018,"Based on the reviews I was prepared to see sophisticated horror but got an aimless ninety minutes of mostly boredom. Here are the main issues I have with this film:1) Daughter is missing, mom calmly goes about her normal routine. Any mother in the world would be climbing the walls with worry.2) Son gets yanked up the chimney, dad doesn't seem too put out by it. If this happened in real life, the whole family would be upset, screaming, terrified, instead they just return to their normal routine. The film takes great pains to set us in reality, then expects the viewer to accept the characters' calm reactions to missing family members. Either go full on horror or broad comedy or something, but make it believable.3) Grandma says keep the fire burning, she's right there in the living room, why can't she keep it burning? 4) The backstory makes ZERO SENSE. She's given a loaf of bread that people take from her, why would they take her bread? It's a major city, of course they would have bread for everyone already. If they're too poor to afford bread, they can't afford Christmas anyway, so why would krampus come because they're poor? Someone didn't think these things through while they were writing the story.5) The characters have all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. The main kid is too old to believe in Santa Claus. The visiting family are painted with broad brush strokes, too obnoxious to be taken seriously, in a film that asks you to suspend disbelief and then is too lazy to write believable characters. The fat aunt marches into the kitchen and criticizes mom's cooking, NO ONE WOULD DO THAT. A talented writer with a lighter touch could have handled that scene with aplomb.I had been looking forward to seeing this film for some time and was greatly disappointed.",Krampus
99,funtasticfour,Not bad but not great either,6,17 November 2018,"This movie was somewhat different than I expected. I thought there would be one creature-(title character) that would be murdering and butchering people left and right. Part of me was glad it wasn't that, but I still felt somewhat let down. Some interesting character effects, not all on the good side. I liked the creepy snowmen outside and expected more from them as well. Still, I'm not a big Christmas movie fan, so I like to see a horror spin on it once in awhile. Glad it was free on Netflix though.",Krampus
100,TwistedContent,The 2nd Yearly Tradition Holiday Horror from Michael Dougherty,8,29 December 2019,"Ever since seeing it on the big screen for the first time, ""Krampus"" has become a yearly tradition for me, as much as the other Michael Dougherty's seasonal horror ""Trick'r'Treat"" & I would love him to do a sequel to one or the other. ""Krampus"" is far from flawless, but it's a wildly entertaining, thoughtful and aesthetically pleasing holiday horror flick.I feel like ""Krampus"" took a lot of risks, which I very much appreciate, but, somehow, stayed a little too conventional at the same time. ""Krampus"" has a dark heart that I absolutely love, Michael Dougherty takes the sweet, perfectionist essence of Christmas and throws it into a blender with the harsh reality of a modern family and the not-all-that-nice vibes surrounding this holiday in the same modern times. The story is carried on by an awesome cast delivering grounded and charming performances, a well befitting atmosphere, and, of course, awesome cinematography, even more awesome FX (including lots of practical effects) and great action sequences. The production design is spot on, really, Krampus himself is just pure and simply nailed. ""Krampus"" does its job well both as a horror and a comedy - the suspense building is as good as the pay-off & some of the jokes are actually funny. I find that the biggest of flaws is the pacing - it suffers a bit during the middle parts. After having seen it five times, I think there could've been a little more action scattered through. The third act delivers a truly fun load of action though, never disappoints me. To top it all off, the ending's much more ominous than happy, that's another +1 from me.""Krampus"" is equal parts dark and funny - a highly entertaining Christmas horror romp for pretty much the whole family. I'll keep the tradition going & still hope for Michael Dougherty to return to the genre of horror and comedy, because the latest ""Godzilla"" is not what he does best... My rating: 8/10.",Krampus
101,skybrick736,Krampus (7/10),7,10 July 2016,"Christmas usually a time of cheerfulness and presents thanks to the jolly Santa is flipped upside down when Krampus comes to town. The events follow an obnoxious family, who are crude in their comedy, and have poor decision making. Funny man Adam Scott and horror vet Toni Collette make a unique couple but are relied upon heavily being the only serious roles written for the film. There is an appropriate blend of comedy and horror, which is seen in the absurdity of characters, evil gingerbread men, and killer toys, not so much the written dialogue. Once Krampus is seen fully his appearance is pretty cool looking like an old decrepit vile Santa. The ending was rather a letdown but overall it was a decent fun horror flick. It would be best to watch Krampus during Christmas time because it does have a great holiday feel to it, worthy of a watch for sure.",Krampus

Or is he more like the God of the Old Testament who uses whatever means necessary to horrify so that people are given the opportunity to turn back from their wayward lives. The latter is my interpretation. This film is for Horror buffs what A Christmas Story is for Childhood Drama buffs.

103,dcarsonhagy,It's Not Nice to Not Believe,6,1 May 2016,"Missed this film during the past holiday season. I finally got around to watching it On-Demand the other evening.""Krampus"" is a film about the legend of Santa Claus's counterpart. While Santa is good and bring presents and lots of joys to people who have been good during the year, he lets his distant brother dole punishment for those who have completely lost the true meaning of Christmas. Krampus is described as being huge, with horns and cloven hooves, as well as a massive head. The legend states for those people bad and completely unfeeling during the holidays, Krampus will beat you with switches and/or chains before taking you in a basket to the Neather Realm.Max, the youngest of a family, desperately wants to believe in the goodness of Christmas and Santa Claus. However, given the situation he is in this is next to impossible. Seems his uncle and nasty clan are visiting for the holidays, and to say they are obnoxious is an understatement. After an encounter with the ""butch"" sisters, Max tears up his annual letter to Santa Claus and that's when all hell breaks loose.I thought the movie was very well done and very well acted, yet it never went over the top. The scenes of Krampus jumping from one house to the other, while in pursuit of Max's sister, was actually scary. Also, the director's choice not to show Krampus that much really helped build the tension. I think watching this will eventually become a holiday tradition. The movie is rated PG-13 for language and minimal violence, I recommend showing the movie to unruly children before Christmas. It just might change their tone! More of a 6.5 movie than a 6.

105,shawneofthedead,"Some good moments, but this is primarily a tonally inconsistent mess that winds up being neither funny nor scary.",4,4 December 2015,"It's tough to blame anyone for not knowing just what to expect from Krampus. The film's marketing campaign has been confusing, to say the least. It's a horror movie! It's a Christmas family comedy! It's both! Some even had high hopes for Krampus to be the next Gremlins - a fun, occasionally creepy but mostly campy parody of the formulaic horror genre. That's not a bad assumption to make, given the presence in the cast of skilled TV comedians such as Adam Scott (oddly scoring top billing over Oscar nominee Toni Collette) and David Koechner. Somewhat depressingly, however, actually sitting down and watching Krampus is unlikely to make things very much clearer. The film careens haphazardly from horror to comedy and back again (or not), sacrificing pretty much everything along the way: laughs, scares, tension and stakes.Workaholic Tom (Scott) and uptight Sarah (Collette) are readying their house and home for the annual holiday descent of family members they'd much rather avoid. These include Sarah's sister, Linda (Allison Tolman), and brother-in-law Howard (Koechner); as well as their brood of four kids and hard-drinking Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). Unfortunately, the visitors don't play well with the young master of the house, Max (Emjay Anthony) - the precocious little boy who still half-believes in Santa Claus. Disillusioned by his family's bickering, Max makes a wish that draws upon his house an evil spirit (and his Christmassy minions) that comes straight out of Germanic folklore and the nightmares of Omi (Krista Stadler), Max's grandmother.Right from the outset, Krampus establishes an almost dour tone that makes it tough for writer-director Michael Dougherty to effectively dial up the comedy later on. There's nothing faintly funny, for instance, about the family dynamics that play out over the dinner table. Insults are hurled, people are bullied, terrible things are said. The few weak gags Dougherty conjures up at this point involve Max's cousins: a kid who stares intensely at people without saying a word, and two tomboys who still behave like giggly mean girls. When Krampus' minions arrive, dragging chaos, a blizzard and hellfire in their wake, everything is played without a single hint of irony. We're meant to be scared, even though it's hard to conjure up much creepy tension around a jack-in-the-box and clumpy, magical snowmen. Later on, the film gets weird(er) - presumably, when cackling gingerbread men and demonic teddy bears turn up, the audience is meant to howl... with laughter. But Krampus is such an odd hodge-podge of tones and ideas that it's hard to know when and how to engage with everything that happens on screen.It doesn't help that the creature part of this feature isn't particularly coherent. The mish-mash of monsters that plague Max's family flit between dark and broody, to bright and giggly. The special effects are decent, especially when it comes to rendering toothsome clowns and flaming cookies. But the horrors themselves contribute to the see-sawing, confusing aspect of the piece: are we supposed to take the clown seriously? Or laugh because of how patently silly it is? Are Krampus' elves meant to be terrifying or ridiculous? Pondering such questions leads to others, such as: can a Christmas movie ever really kill off all its characters? The answer to this final question nags throughout the film, prompting more cynical audience members to disengage from the characters and their final fates.That's not to say Krampus is entirely without merit. Actually, Dougherty has a few excellent ideas struggling to break free from the rather shapeless mess that constitutes much of the film. His opening sequence is a sharp, satirical burst of mayhem set to Bing Crosby's It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas - suggesting, with dry wit, that we are the real monsters who have blithely forgotten the true meaning of the holiday season. There's a completely bonkers scene set in the attic - featuring three adults, an axe, toys come to life and a lot of screaming - that comes closest to nailing the oddball vibe that was sorely missing from a great deal of the film. Also, there lies nestled within Krampus an absolutely delightful gem of an animated sequence, gorgeously designed and rendered in claymation to tell of Omi's firsthand encounter with Krampus as a child. It almost - operative word: almost - makes up for the film's frustrating cop-out ending.Krampus also benefits from a cast of actors who are completely and utterly committed to all the different stories they've been tasked to tell. Each one of them, from Scott to Stadler, plays his or her role in deadly earnest. Indeed, anyone looking to hire an actor who never phones it in need look no further than Collette. Bless her heart - even when screaming her face off while being attacked by a creepy angel doll, she performs what's required of her with a verve and depth that the script and her underbaked character don't really deserve.Perhaps it's unfair to wish that Krampus had been better able to blend its myriad ideas, themes and tones into a coherent whole. After all, the zany, off-kilter, campy comedy of Gremlins is a fragile thing: too much and it will grate, too little and it falls flat. Nonetheless, the handful of times Dougherty manages to skate that fine line suggests that a cannier script and a more experienced director might have more effectively mined both the humour and horror in Krampus.",Krampus
106,kermitkid,"Fun, dark Christmas romp is callback to 80s.",9,30 March 2020,"I'll just say this right now: to enjoy this movie you need to go in with the right mindset. If you're expecting straight-up horror that will make it hard to fall asleep at night, this is not the film for you. However, if you're expecting dark comedy than you will most likely enjoy this film. It's obvious it was influenced by ""Gremlins"" and ""Poltergeist"" in some parts. Without giving too much away, I will say that if you were a child of the '80's you will definitely be reminiscing about those movies. That's not to say it's a straight ripoff of them, though. It's definitely got some originality to it. If you're a ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" fan, you'll probably enjoy ""Krampus."" There's even a flashback sequence entirely animated in stop-motion and it's beautifully done. Even during the parts that are supposed to be scary, it's so over-the-top and goofy that it's hard to take those parts seriously. That's not a complaint. I enjoyed that. I was smiling and laughing nearly the whole time. Even the score takes classic Christmas music and gives it a dark, warped feeling. You will never be able to hear ""Carol of the Bells"" the same way again. So, if you're tired of the cliche ""we love each other"" saccharine sweet Christmas films and you're looking for something different, this is the film for you. I have a feeling that in about 10-20 years this will be considered a classic like ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Elf,"" Nightmare Before Christmas"" and of course ""Gremlins.""Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars",Krampus
107,Rendanlovell,A fun ride that lacks intrigue.,7,9 December 2015,"Krampus is the latest ""horror"" film from Michael Dougherty. Who also directed 'Trick 'r Treat'. However, 'Krampus' is not about Halloween it's about Christmas (Obviously). One thing that I loved right off the bat was how self aware the film was. From the opening shot, the film seems to talk to its audience. Saying, you're gonnna have fun if you don't take this to seriously. The film knows that merging cheer and horror is not an easy task so instead of trying to hard at either one it does both. It knows that it is absolutely ridiculous and it takes that and runs with it. Everything from the creature design to the structure of the film displays it's self awareness. This was easily the best part of the film.Watching a film that knows how insane it is makes it that much better. In doing this you are no longer laughing at the film but with the film. It also displays a certain maturity from the director. He had an incredibly tough job to. He had to make a low budget PG-13 horror movie set during Christmas. And he did a great job.The film also has some impressive production value. It may not have a pitch perfect dramatic cast but the actors it has do a great job. More or less they are known for comedy, not drama. So, taking that into account, they really did a great job. The look of the film is also very impressive. It's definitely one of the best looking and directed PG- 13 horror films out there.It also is a surprising parody of Hallmark type of Christmas films. The entire first act just feels like it's making fun of these terribly sappy Christmas movies. Where a family gets together for the holidays and things are nearly ruined by really stupid relatives. At first I thought this was not something the film did right. But as it got a bit further into things I realized that it was following this stereotypical plot a little to closely.That is when I flashed back to the genius opening scene and remembered what this film was. But, I don't want to give off the impression that this film is brilliant or anything. It's certainly flawed. One of these issues was in its characters. Films in this genre that are great make the characters deaths feel like they matter. But 'Krampus' never achieves this. Every time a character died it was over shadowed by a hilarious creature design or a lack of an emotional bond between the audience.As these characters start to get picked off it was hard to care. But the biggest misstep this film makes is in its ending. At first it seemed like it was going to end on a very risky note. A note that was all to perfect for the film. Yet, it didn't. This event happens and it kept going. So, instead of ending on a depressingly high note the film ended in the sappiest way possible. A conclusion that the film seemed to be utterly against up until that point.However, 'Krampus' is a lot of fun. Its complete disregard for the typical holiday film rule book made for an incredibly entertaining experience. It was smartly constructed, nicely shot and impressively directed. The problem is, it has a hard time making its characters feel like they matter. By doing this the film falls into the very thing that it was making fun of.",Krampus
108,TheRedDeath30,Uneven Tone Ruins a Good Idea,6,29 May 2016,"I am a massive fan of Michael Dougherty's cult classic film, TRICK R TREAT, so when it was announced that he would be tackling another holiday horror, I waited for it with anticipation. After all, the film was combining the talents of Dougherty, with the idea of a Christmas horror comedy (bearing to mind one of my favorite films of all time, GREMLINS) and combine that with the use of the Krampus character, who's become so hip over the last decade. This seemed like a can't miss proposition, but the results are, sadly, disappointing.The horror/ comedy hybrid is very hard to pull off and do well. People have been trying since the days of Abbott and Costello meeting the Universal monsters and have always met with mixed results. The rare classic, like SHAUN OF THE DEAD or ZOMBIELAND, is the exception to the rule that pumps out dozens of forgettable horror/ comedy hybrids that can be found all over the horror landscape. The trick is in getting just the right mix of ingredients and having them both work well. Too much horror or too much comedy one way or the other makes the movie feel uneven. In the case of this movie, it's not enough of either and we end up with a movie that never quite seems sure of what it wants to be. Confusing all of that is a tendency, in this flick, to want to inject some touchy feely family moments, as well.The basic plot is Christmas VACATION, where a cousin Eddie type character and his hillbilly kids come to stay with a rich family for the holidays, throwing in a few animals and odd old people. The tomboy cousins steal our hero's letter to Santa and use it to mock him. This leads to the boy throwing a hissy fit and tearing up his letter, which seems to be some sort of invitation for the Krampus and his minions to kill everyone in their town, just because one boy stops believing in the joy of Christmas, or some such Hollywood sentiment.Within the first few minutes, we start having our first deaths and the movie seems promising, but it never really gets off the ground. Despite having a cast of many familiar faces, the humor is just flat. I found myself, many times through the film, knowing that they were going for laughs but not able to find them myself. I honestly cannot say that there was one moment that I even chuckled a little. Maybe the jokes were meant for a younger audience, but I feel that they were moreso poorly written. So, if the comedy doesn't work for you, then the horror has to and that falls flat as well. I really wanted to like this movie. I love that Daugherty tried to inject a number of monsters, rather than just the Krampus, but most are bad. We get an evil Jack in the Box, who looks like a special effects student's first year project. He looks bad. He moves poorly. The facial animations are horribly done. He is neither scary, nor amusing. Then, we get a gang of ginger bread men who look like castaways from SHREK and end up just as scary. Again, I think they are intended for humor, but it just doesn't work.The one monster that works well is the Krampus, who is an incredible creature design that I found to be terrifying in brief moments. Alas, his part is far too small, in the end, despite his title billing. The stupid ginger bread men really get more screen time than he does and it's a shame because there was a great movie hiding in there somewhere using that fabulously designed monster, but he got lost in a sea of bad script writing.I just can't figure what they were going for here. If this was meant as a scary family film, then the ending and final act throw it off kilter, as far too mean spirited. If this was supposed to be horror, then the bad jokes and poorly designed monsters ruined it. If it's a comedy, then they need better joke writers and less annoying actors. I'm going to imagine a do-over, with the sense of insane horrific fun that Dougherty injected into his first film and a terrifying Krampus monster because this is one movie that was much better as an idea than as a final result.",Krampus

This is a perfect xmas treat for anyone who grew up with 80s movies like Gremlins etc. This movie is clearly inspired by the movies from that era. It's kind of like horror version of The National Lampoons Christmas Vacation. There's even a scene where the relatives arrive that is almost identical to the Christmas Vacation movie.The production values are really high, the effects work and the winter atmosphere is really good. Krampus and the ""creatures"" could be from a Terry Gilliam movie.Not a huge fan of Adam Scott, but he isn't quite as annoying here as he has been in some movies I've seen from him. The rest of the cast is quite good too.The movie has a tongue in cheek feel to it, which takes away from the actual scariness. Horror comedy is not an easy genre to pull off, but this movie really works quite well.

112,mistoppi,Not worth your money,3,4 December 2015,"I didn't raise my expectations too high, since I learned Krampus is both comedy and horror. Still, I was disappointed.The good parts of this movie are in the beginning and the end of the movie.The first time when the Krampus is introduced, that moment is perfectly scary. It's amazing and so skilfully made. The ending of the movie is amazing. It's a total surprise, especially after you think you've been severely disappointed. That's some skillful planning right there.That's it. Most of the movie isn't that good.After seeing Krampus for the first time, nothing is as scary as that moment. There are moments that build up the tension and you feel something horrible coming up, but you are let down. Even Krampus is ruined. He stops being scary after the audience could see him. After he is shown it ruins the feeling. It definitely ruined it, because when you don't see him, you build something in your mind that the true face of Krampus can never be as terrifying as the idea of him. The comedy part of this movie really succeeds. The mystery is, was some of the humour intentional or not? Some of the scenes seem like they are meant to be terrifying, but they are so ridiculous there's no other choice but to laugh. But I guess gingerbread men are meant to be hilarious - and they are. They are weird and funny in a really disturbing way. The dialogue succeeds really well at being funny, and it had the strengths of both horror and comedy - and the weaknesses of comedy.Krampus might have some really good parts, but it really isn't worth your money. It's really boring, and horror movies are not meant to be boring. If you really want to see it, you're going to be disappointed. It's boring, and its potential is flashed too rarely.",Krampus

Santa Claus is synonymous with Christmas and the Christmas Season is love and warmth to some extent. Someone should be responsible for bad children, No? Undoubtedly, this film marks footprint , not only for its argument, marks footprint for its release date ( Christmas). It is something entirely different. Tom (Adam Scott) is the typical father who only have time for work and have to spend days trapped with his wife's family. Sarah (Toni Collette) is an apathetic mother who wants to keep the spirit of Christmas in her broken family, forcibly. Her perfectionism and low tolerance to take her to strengthen family ties. Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) is the popular Hollywood teen problem, ( cliché character ) not caring for your family and Max (Emjay Anthony) is a young child who still believes in Christmas, cookies and Santa Claus, defrauded of his family, he decided to forget his beliefs to make way for the evil spirit of Christmas. Another cliché character is the uncle Howard (David Koechner) who is only interested in criticizing, ruin Christmas dinner, love the weapons and be easy prey for the movie monster murderer, his wife (Conchata Ferrell) that oddly is not a cliché character, is one of the surprises of the plot points and their two daughters odious that only serve to fill. The development of the story is good but specific to a horror movie, Step One: We hate Christmas, Step Two: A hellish storm was momentarily dismantled, Step Three: In rare circumstances, bad girl ventures out and get her deserved, Step Four: From there on, the once-fractured family is forced to come together in order to fend off an extended siege from such nasty creatures as demonic dolls, hellacious harlequins and evil elves, all of which are mere opening acts to an appearance from the big bad himself. Step Five: Frightened family, family death, Step Six: Lesson Learned. Michael Dougherty has become a master of horror , performing the cult classic ""Trick 'r Treat."" Like the previous , Michael honors past classic in his movies, ""Trick 'r Treat"" pays as homage to ""Tales from the Crypt"" and ""Creepshow"" with its anthology format. Joe Dante's ""Gremlins"" serves as a reference for find the perfect blend of creepiness, subversive humor and genuinely earned sentiment, to make it a seasonal favorite for viewers who prefer their Christmas entertainment to have a little more bite to it. Krampus intention is to work on those same lines , but never makes it to the top. Although the opening is quite original ( recreating a Christmas comedy ) fun and effective but introducing pieces of a good horror movie, unfortunately , despite the decision to classify the movie family-friendly PG-13 rating (even though no sane parental units would deem it to be acceptable viewing for the wee ones) it can never achieve what you want to be, given that it would have worked quite well with R rating. It might have worked better if the first part would not have spread so much time to get your gear. "" Krampus "" has even more , is a box full of good surprises , and more notable point is that Michael used to perfection the mix humor - horror not turn his movie on a typical Christmas movie , going to cheesy and stupid .

115,supermaggie,Good attempt with an inventive well-done new villain (with too little stage time),8,2 June 2016,"I can (just) imagine the reason of the negative reviews to be that the reviewers expected a slasher movie like Black Christmas. Horror fans hoping for inventive deaths like Final Destination will be disappointed. This does not mean that the film is lame or a flop. Quite the opposite, not only does it feature a great line-up of actors (Toni Collette, Adam Scott, the hilarious Conchata Ferrell) and an inventive staging (a flashback/background story is done as an animation), the Christmas spirit is also well captured, both in a positive (pleasant holiday music, etc.) as well as in a creepy way (the snowbound winter landscape, the eerie atmosphere), the biggest ace, however, is Krampus himself - but this also poses the great weakness of the movie: Krampus is a well-done, original, cool, creepy, exciting creature - the rare times he can be seen, since most of his bloody work is taken over by his little helpers, and while the tireless fans of Gremlins, Puppet Master, etc. will probably cheer, fans of Krampus / less chaotic bustle are annoyed relatively quickly. Less ""Toy Story"" and more Krampus would have definitely improved the movie.

Having heard of the praise this movie got, I was interested as to why. Needless to say, I got my answer. For those who don't know, Krampus is from the actual Santa Claus folklore: while Santa rewards those who have been good, Krampus punishes those who have not. It was made in the style of classic 80s horror such as ""Poltergeist"" and ""Gremlins"", complete with some of the most impressive practical effects I've seen in a while (hardly any CGI was used), while also subverting some of the usual trappings of that era, which I commend. Plot: All little Max wanted was to celebrate Christmas with his family like they used to, but most of the folks have become increasingly dysfunctional to the point where it's unbearable. Disillusioned, he turns his back on the holiday, which summons the nefarious Krampus and his minions to their doorstep. Now, they struggle to survive this not-so-jolly onslaught while also learning what it truly means to be a family. While I personally wasn't scared, there are plenty of things in ""Krampus"" that were effectively disturbing with mild comedy. The titular antagonist is a truly fantastical nightmare, sporting a beautifully twisted design and unnerving presence, a perfect antithesis of ol' St. Nick. The little minions are both varied and creepy in each of their own ways, taking all the things we typically associate with the holiday and turning them upside down. The atmosphere and environment offer the appropriate chilling (pun intended) feeling of isolation this kind of story warrants. Surprisingly, I found myself emotionally invested in most of the family. You see how they've fallen apart yet you get shreds of who they used to be and want to see that side of them brought to the forefront. It's kind of like ""Christmas Vacation"" and ""Home Alone"" in that respect. The most pure, and personally interesting, of them are Max and his grandmother Omi. As of yet, I can hardly think of anything major to criticize with this film. It's definitely earned its place in the world of cinema and the director is already making it big (currently directing ""Godzilla 2: King of the Monsters""). If you want something refreshing to see next Christmas, then I'd say give ""Krampus"" a try.",Krampus

A good Christmas based Horror movie with a fun story and awesome atmosphere throughout the run time of this movie.Some good character interactions in the movie and a great monster design make this a fun little flick for Horror Fans.The story in this movie is very interesting with a demon being awaken called Krampus who is here to punish this family after a character called Max loses his Christmas spirit. Its an interesting story that plays on an old legend set around Christmas.The effects for the most Are awesome especially for Krampus I really like the design he is so creepy and he really adds to the overall atmosphere of the movie.There are some dated effects in the movie for example the Gingerbread Men in one scene look really silly but I do like the scene.The character interactions are awesome in this movie and the Family Dynamic is handled very well in the film and the characters play off each other great and keep your interest throughout the movie.I also really like the Backstory for Krampus and the little animation segment we get works really when telling the story and his a unique style for a Horror movie like this and it still manages to have a horror feel to it that's possibly my favourite scene in the movie I love it.My only issues with the film besides some odd effects here and there is sometimes some characters can be a little over the top mainly when fighting the creatures in the third act it's still fun but can take you out of the story a little bit.Also the ending is a little confusing it's an interesting ending but it's not really well explained it seems like Krampus has trapped them forever in their own perfect Christmas but I'm not sure it's an odd and confusing end to a pretty great movie.But this movie is a lot of fun and I do enjoy it alot even with its flaws its an interesting story that keeps your attention and has a wicked design for a monster this is a fun Christmas style Horror movie.Verdict 8/10 a great fun Christmas themed Horror movie with an Interesting story and some great characters and monster design that I like alot some flawed moments and dated effects but one hell of a fun Horror movie.,Krampus

120,RhapsodyReviews,Blew Expectations.,8,12 December 2019,"Review:
'Krampus' is a comedy-horror film directed by Michael Dougherty. It is based on the eponymous character from Austro-Bavarian folklore.
I seen this movie when it first came out and I was so happy to have a Christmas themed horror film that was actually good.
When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max (Emjay Anthony) is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know; this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non-believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive.
The acting is surprisingly strong. Adam Scott as the classic overworking father, Toni Collette as the anguish wife and David Koechner as the overbearing mean spirited uncle who provide great conflict in a dysfunctional nightmare at each other. Even the child performances not once cringe me at all!
The story is simple but executed in a way that is so entertaining it makes you want to watch it again and again. The comedy doesn't always hit and makes tense scenes seem awkward rather than have added humor. But the movie is very tense at times and while it is lacking in humor, its all entertaining.
Overall, the movie is a Christmas film with a horror twist and if you're into that, give this a try. It has a great cast and above all a great and simple story.

It has suspense and darkness all along and despite the small doses of humor here and there, it is purely thriller.

It was certainly a great surprise! While people compare this movie to Gremlins I guarantee you it is nothing like Gremlins. This movie is its own movie! The acting was top notch, even when there were elements of cheesiness that occurred they all managed to keep it great! The director also did ""Trick Or Treat"" which is another Halloween cult classic. But Krampus surpasses ""Trick Or Treat"" by a long shot. The story was good, and it keeps you really glued to the screen wandering what will happen next. There are also many scenes that are hilarious. Most of the humour came from Aunt Dorothy. Many people online will complain that the characters/actors were too unbelievable and so unlikeable. This is the whole point of the movie. This is a story of a broken with family with no love, no respect and no desire to love Christmas. And then Krampus comes to town! The Practical Effects were used so well. I like the fact there was no CGI used for this movie (with the exception of the Ginger Bread Men). It's kept old school, and it never fails to amaze us. Without spoiling anything...the story does start out quite slow. But as soon as the blizzard hits...you know you're in for the roller-coaster ride. Kramous's minions are awesome and scary, to say the least! When Krampus's appears his face will give you nightmares! The ending was very original and very unexpected. I really hope this becomes a movie (like Home Alone) that comes on TV every year for all of us to appreciate the spirit of Christmas! All in all, it is a cult classic and it was quite a surprise on how good it was. Had no idea this would be a movie I would love so much.

124,justinwfirestone,A fun dark romp.,7,16 December 2015,"Krampus, or as the grandma says, KARAHMPOOSE, is a wink-wink take on Christmas movies, part comedy, part horror, part thriller, but generally all fun from the get-go. In fact, we barely have time to mock the War on Christmas before Krampus arrives, which is good, because that makes the rest of the movie a fast-paced battle.You see, Krampus is sort of like the opposite of Santa Claus, because he comes not to give, but to take. He's like an anti-Santa, or a demon-Santa. He's got horns and hooves and he's big and jumps around a lot and cackles. And he has minions: dark elves, demonic gingerbread men, evil jacks-in-the-box, and a handful of other mean-spirited and murderous friends. He also apparently makes menacing snowmen in your yard when you're not watching, and he doesn't like it when you keep the fire in the fireplace hot.That's because he prefers sliding down chimneys, but he's too big, so he rips through the brick and mortar just like a Patriot missile tearing apart the fuselage of a Scud rocket. He starts a real War on Christmas, because he only appears when everyone loses the Christmas Spirit, that spirit of giving and sacrifice that can only be found in your heart.Krampus is sadistic but has a sense of humor. A jack-in-the-box greedily wipes blood from his lips after a juicy meal, and the demonic gingerbread men dance and play like gremlins. And when they're done ruining Christmas, they have a big party around a nice fire pit.The movie does a nice job of riding the fence between mocking people who believe there's a War on Christmas, and those who think Christmas is nothing but a spectacle of the fetish of commodities. David Koechner is good as a backwoods, conservative boor, but even he and the other unlikable characters take sincere turns for the better.But not before Krampus takes his cut.",Krampus

127,MattBirk,Not Enough Toy-Fueled-Mayhem,5,8 December 2015,"Dare I say I was rather disappointed with Krampus? I knew it was going to be a light-heard horror story about a family paying for their misdeeds, but it felt like it was missing something. Possibly even holding back to a certain degree. The movie most similar to this is without question, Gremlins, another Christmas time horror movie where a bunch of creatures wreak havoc in a small town. The comparisons are there, both silly horror movies that are more comical than terrifying. The problem is that Gremlins embraced the silliness and Krampus did not. Instead, Krampus seemed to hold back the fun and debauchery for too much of the film. Yes, there are a few bursts of action between the humans and the toys/minions that Krampus controls, but things don't get out of hand enough to make the movie truly worth while.For too much of the film we hear the creatures making noise from above or outside the house, teasing us of their presence but when the time comes to reveal them, their appearances are too brief (seriously, why did the cookies have four minutes of screen time?). Of course we get to actually see them up close and the animatronics look quite nice, but the movie holds out for too long before we get to this point, unfortunately.This is the same director from the cult classic horror film, Trick r Treat, which I like quite a bit (though not as much as the general horror community). When looking at the two, it's easy to see Trick r Treat being the superior film, mostly because it's a nice balance between Halloween tradition, holiday spirit, and being the perfect amount of over the top carnage. Krampus has the tradition, a degree of holiday spirit, but only goes half speed during the fight scenes when it should have went to eleven (Spinal Tap anyone?).Krampus has its fun moments but the it should have went the Gremlins route and welcomed its silliness earlier on and went for broke from there.",Krampus
128,pal05052003,"When a child loses faith in Christmas, he unleashes the Krampus; an ancient demon who 'only comes to punish' and to take.",9,9 December 2015,"Following the gaining popularity of the Krampus, Michael Dougherty's take on the legend is the perfect blend of scare, fun, and magic. Casting normal-looking casts (with the notable exception of Adam Scott), the movie feels relatable and makes the shock of the Krampus more pronounced. The story begins with a normal family trying to have a 'normal' Christmas by having their relatives come in. Of course things don't work out. The in-laws don't get along, neither do the cousins. What would seem like a springboard for a regular family comedy takes a dark turn when a letter to Santa is torn to shreds and is blown away with the wind. From then the horror part of the story unfolds. The movie does not try to get too sentimental, but in the end you will root for many of the characters, not just the protagonist. I think the true horror of this movie is the fact that this happens to a really normal family, not the stock characters in a slasher movie. Of course, there is the stereotypical old lady who knows about ghost, but she is not a pivotal character in the movie and only serves to introduce the Krampus (much later in the film), so she does not count. Another thing I like about the movie is that is has a Christmas feel to it, despite being a horror. The Krampus actually feels like Santa's dark side, and the elves are creepy (but are these movie elves wearing masks, or are the masks supposed to be the real faces of the elves?). Another thing that is how the outdoor scenes contrast the indoor ones. In fact, the snow scenes look so harsh, and glum that I would rather put up a fight (in vain) with the Krampus than venture in the snow. Like other Christmas movies, it has a happy ending.... But the problem is: is it? Thus, I think Krampus is a brilliant Christmas themed horror movie and will probably set the trend for more Christmas horrors in the future. Once again Michael Dougherty has set the standard for 'holiday-themed' horror. ... Now, when is Treat R Treat 2 coming out?",Krampus
129,Milk_Tray_Guy,Pretty good Christmas horror with a lot of laughs,7,21 November 2021,"Ridiculous (in the best way) comedy/horror that plays out like a dark flipside of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation! Stars Adam Scott, Toni Collette, and David Koechner. It's a Gremlins-ish throwback to 80s horror, with mostly practical effects, including an in-suit performance for Krampus (who looks really impressive, from when we first glimpse him in the shadows and half-light, right through to the full reveal). Despite it being a comedy, it gets pretty tense in places. At times the 'group under seige', cut-off by a snowstorm had an almost 30 Days of Night feel. But before long sheer lunacy rears its head again. Twenty minutes from the end I was pretty sure where it was leading... only to (happily) find I was wrong! Fun Movie. 7/10.",Krampus
130,elmoslively,Not much Christmas cheer in this one.,7,9 December 2018,"What I liked best about this movie is its overall production design, it definitely has a look of creepiness. The script is okay, with plenty of black humour and there are some effective jump scares. The acting is okay, but the overall storyline reminded me of an episode of "" American Dad"" that I saw a few years ago.",Krampus

133,Sunsphxsuns,Krampus - He's Here To Make A Point!,10,31 October 2017,"Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas, have always been my favorite holidays. In addition to great food, and family time, it is also a time when filmophiles can guiltlessly gorge on a panoply of holiday films. Truthfully, not all holiday cinema is great, but Michael Dougherty's Krampus hits on all cylinders, beginning with the sentimental, passing on to humorously engaging, and carefully rising up to terrific horror. Dougherty's previous Halloween movie, Trick 'r Treat, had quickly become one of my favorite films, not only thematically, but because there was so much attention to detail. Krampus shares the same painstaking, beautifully filmed scenes so reminiscent of the late and wonderful writer/director John Hughes (Home Alone, Uncle Buck, Planes, Trains and Automobiles). And it is this very detailed focus that skillfully draws you into the film, locking you into the story and its various characters. Dougherty's vision of Krampus blends some of the darker Austrian and German supernatural fables with our more contemporary idea of a delightful Coca Cola Santa Claus. But Krampus isn't here to reward good children, indeed, he's arrived to punish the naughty ones. As in Trick 'r Treat, Dougherty has assembled a stellar cast, and an accomplished team to bring Krampus to life. And it is so much more than a ""slasher"" flick. Krampus glows in its own horrific nature, an embodiment of all that is good and bad when families get together to celebrate the holidays.To reveal anymore of this wonderful film would spoil the fun you'll have watching it for the first time. Rent the DVD or BR and enjoy the beautiful photography, the perfect cast, the great soundtrack, and above all, know that this is surely just the beginning of Michael Dougherty's amazing career as a filmmaker. Michael, if you're reading this, PLEASE don't make us wait too long for Trick 'r Treat 2, OK?",Krampus
134,mwcrunner,Funny but not scary,6,24 April 2016,"This movie was more of a comedy than a horror film. The part in this movie that I found quite amusing were those gingerbread men. Also if there really is a Krampus, Santa would come and kick his ass. I did make a drawing of that of Santa as a Jedi and fighting Krampus who is a dark lord of the Sith on Deviantart. Also the very ending of that movie that whole misfit family were in a snow globe in hell version of Santa's workshop which is of course Krampuses workshop. Now this is a Christmas film that I don't plan on watching every Christmas like the Grinch and A Christmas Story but at least I got to see it once. I give this movie 6 out of 10.",Krampus
135,tjgoalie13,A Great Satire on the American Society,7,6 December 2015,"Krampus is yet another Christmas horror-comedy that satirizes the American family, and the merriest time of the year. Beneath all of it's scary creatures, and comedy oriented cast is a message about family, and the Christmas spirit. Krampus is a funny, and often scary Christmas horror movie, despite its weak and somewhat confusing ending. In an age when Christmas time means something different to everybody, this movie is especially impressive because it appeals to all of those people.Krampus' humor is one of the film's biggest strengths as it opens with a hilarious black Friday scene. The humor came as no surprise, considering the cast, but what was slightly surprising was that the comedy was more black-comedy, which blended beautifully with the horror tones. The film in many ways is a satire on our society in general, poking fun at how divided we are and our overall apathy towards the things that matter. Although the film has a pretty biting take on the American family, it has a somewhat positive outlook on it. The creatures in the film are a combination of gremlins, and a terrible holiday nightmare. The different types of creative creatures the film uses is truly impressive and terrifying. The black comedy blends beautifully with the twisted variations on holiday toys and treats. Despite all of this the film does have it's share of weaknesses. The most notable is the ending.The film has a good narrative flow, and pushes through until the last 10 minutes of the film. In the last 10 minutes, one characters turns a 180 and the plot becomes confusing. Without giving anything away, the film has multiple endings and by the end it's tough to tell what happened. On top of the weak ending, many times the film feels like a gremlins rip off. On top of that the satire on the family falls a little flat, as many characters remain stereotypes.Krampus does deliver on the humor and the horror that it promises, and if that's all you're expecting then you won't be disappointed. The film even gives a funny look at the American society, even if it's a little thin. In the end Krampus is a fun take on Christmas horror, and horror comedy, so if you like either of those genres, check it out.",Krampus
136,thisseatofmars,"A better modern Christmas movie than Will Ferrel's ""Elf.""",5,12 August 2016,"""Krampus"" isn't super great. The opening sequence features violent shoppers storming a Wallmart on Christmas Eve, all set to cheery music: so, cynicism, obvious irony, etc set the tone. How original. Look too close and you can see the extras forcing their angry faces.Then you meet the cast. There's the boy (who has a Gypsy Danger toy from Pacific Rim on his desk! Rad!!!) who's a bit *too* sweet and innocent, and his weirdly sexy grandma. Toni with an 'i' Colette and David Koechner, who I like a lot, round out the cast. Koechner plays yet another bigot unfortunately, playing a parody of a Republican. Way to insult half your demographic, filmmakers. At one point, Koechner's character says, ""Wish we had some Bing Crosby to listen to,"" eliciting disgust from the tediously superior Karl Urban lookalike playing Colette's husband. (Hey-- what's your problem with Bing, Not-Karl?) So, the characters are all stereotypes. But that's fine: ""Krampus"" is a special effects horror movie, not Woyzeck or Hamlet. And what special effects we have! Keen attention to detail went into crafting the puppets and CGI. I think the placement of Gypsy Danger on the boy's desk was done on purpose by the filmmakers: Pacific Rim is a movie loved by people who love film. Some genuine heart went into ""Krampus"" and it shows in elements like the animated backstory of the grandmother as well as the design of Krampus himself.""Krampus"" is more fantasy than comedy or horror. The film works thanks to the natural charm of ""Krampus's"" effects and animation, in spite of the cynical and obvious comedy slowing it all down. At least it's better than Will Ferrel's ""Elf.""",Krampus
137,LinkGoku,Very entertaining Christmas comedy/horror,9,5 December 2015,"A dysfunctional family gathers for Christmas, when the Christmas spirit is dead, Krampus comes to punish the naughty.Writer/Director Michael Dougherty (Trick R Treat) brings us this fun flick. Similar to Trick R Treat Krampus is more fun then scary. But that only works in its favor. Its not filled with comedic lines or anything like that. Its the mix of crude characters with awesome creatures.Notice horror is the last genre listed. That's because it doesn't really treat itself like horror. It doesn't have a bunch of cheap jump scares, its not gonna gross people out. It just has a lot of fun creature action.All of the creatures look great, but none more so then Krampus himself. Every scene he's in is generally exciting.The only downfall I can think of is that there are some dumb character decisions. Given with horror films you generally have to have some dumb characters to carry the plot. I also felt the end was a tad rushed. Though it still had awesome visuals.This film isn't for everyone, some may not find this to be fun. But you couldn't have wiped the smile off my face :)",Krampus
138,georgecoffeynewyorker,Christmas horror with a Comedy aspect in it.,7,14 December 2015,"Not bad a movie. You will most certainly be entertained with Conchata Farrell's comic action like one line was fantastic. ""I haven't been this hungover since the Pope died"",. We all got a great laugh from this. She bring's her Two and A Half Men character onto the big screen. The genre of the movie is Horror/Comedy. The visual effects wowwww, but more importantly, the plot was quite simple to follow. The plot being as I said above, was that a young boy wishes the OPPOSITE of wishes. In that mayhem ensues when Max's family tree comes, ie the Aunts, Uncles, Cousins etc., So in a fit, he rips up Santas's letter and throws into the sky, hence where Krampus comes and causes mayhem. IN the end, it is found that Max receives a Bauble with Krampus on it. We all thought it was a dream, however when its realised that it wasn't, who knew. Something tells me a SEQUEL might be on the cards.",Krampus

Young Max gives up on Christmas because his horrible dysfunctional family are just horrible and dysfunctional.The good bits... the creatures are cleverly and creepily realised. Krampus is a Christmas devil you would be scared of. It's an interesting idea.The bad bits, the family characters were terribly clichéd. The actors tried, but there really wasn't anything for them to work with. Hands down the best character was Omi, but even she broke character to tell them all the tale of her childhood encounter with Krampus in perfect English, she had only spoken German up to that point. Another character has to cover this strange and clumsy gear change with an awkward line which said ""Ah English, I thought so.""The ending was beyond strange. I couldn't work out if Max had succeeded or not. Overall, somewhat disappointing.",Krampus
140,A_Llama_Drama,'Twas the Night Before Christmas...,6,5 December 2015,"and we all fell promptly asleep out of boredom.Krampus is the story of a family (and a society) that has lost its Christmas spirit. While relatives gather and children bicker, one kid has had enough and gives up what remains of his Christmas cheer. Unsuspectingly, he summons Krampus, the less friendly of Christmas heroes and suddenly the family home is under siege from dark elves, demon goats and monstrous toys.What starts out as a possible thrill ride with an abundance of black humour and scares slowly reveals itself to be a completely confused mess of horror, comedy and drama. Not scary enough to maintain the energy or suspense, not funny enough to cut through the slower moments and not enough real reason to care for a family that doesn't really seem to have any problems other than the fact that they all find each other slightly annoying. The pacing is far too slow for a horror - its plodding and bloated with far too many things happening in between scary moments, consistently dampening any terror you may be feeling. About halfway through we're treated to an animation of Krampus' history which is neither interesting nor originally animated and comes straight after the kidnapping/murder of a child... not really the time for storytelling, is it? It's not entirely made clear what happens to any of the caught victims so it's never that scary if they're caught - they could be taken to a spa for treatments or forced to watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" on repeat for all we know.Saying that, there is some fun to be had. The adult cast are great and seem to be having a lot of fun. Conchita Ferrell is hilarious as an alcoholic, acerbic aunt and David Koechner does what he does best.The biggest disappointment arises when the mania finally sets in. Having given no real indication of what Krampus or his minions are capable of, it's rather confusing when a bunch of demonic toys wreak havoc. Although it's a hilarious (and at moments scary) scene, this should have been a manic release of all the tension so far built. Instead, the poor direction and editing has just led us into the event with no real giddiness. Gremlins this is not. Nor is it Black Christmas (2006). Unhappily, it occupies some squalid straddle over Bad Santa, The Grinch and Nightmare Before Christmas. A lot of good potential squandered on a dull and unoriginal script, lazy editing and unfortunate direction. If you can't sleep on Christmas Eve, watch Krampus, it'll send you off in a second.",Krampus

It looked promising, so I thought I'd give it a real shot. It took so long for the story to get going, that by the time it did, I didn't care. The dysfunctional family was so overplayed, it seemed very forced. I understand campy, but this was a bit much. Every single visitor was WAY dysfunctional. The story was never explained very well and there was a lot you just had to 'go with.'The makeup and special effects were pretty good. Some of the lines were amusing.

Krampus !,9,12 December 2015,"Listen, i don't know a lot about Michael Dougherty other than he made ''Trick R Treat'' a good fantasy-horror film divided in three stories, and it was done in a great way that it makes Tales from the Crypt look like something written by a child.Here, 2015 surprise of the year to me with ''The Guest'' and ''The Gift'' this year, is ''Krampus''. I did not know that this movie will be that good. In fact, i go watch the movie in theatres with little to no excitement. I love Christmas and horror, but the mix of the two is very strange so i don't know. But at the end, i was... oh my god give us sequels Dougherty !!!!Adam Scott, Toni Collette, David Koechner and the always great and underrated Conchata Ferrell (Two and a Half Men) stars in this horror-comedy-suspense-fantasy film you did not know you have to seen this year ! It's a tale about a boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a Christmas demon to his family home. Like the IMDb short story says. But the fun start at the beginning with the Black Friday extravaganza and all theses over the top people that we do remember in our own family or neighbours... then you meet this family lead by Collette and Scott, two talented actors who make a good couple together. Colette is as usual very funny in her way and do all the things a ''perfect'' family will do to impress... and when that family comes, lead by David Koechner, the fun never stop... it looks like Home Alone, Christmas Vacation at parts and Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday The 13th at other times...when i read the budget at around 15 Millions i could not believe... because there's ton of great effects and lots of imagination...that movie is nearly perfect, there's a little part i was bored but it's about 5 minutes in the whole 100 minutes films. watch it !

Maybe a tiny bit scarier in parts but overall not paranormal activity or conjuring levels. Its not jump scares but sinister imagery and monsters that scare you here.The first part is well scripted and quite comical as the relatives that don't get on turn up with well-timed comedy insults flying around, really well actually.
Then the Krampus and his many scary helpers turn up.Production, acting and script are first class and it is a really well made movie. Its just not really scary or gory but its not really supposed to be. Although its 15 certified its only a few expletives I feel that really make it not suitable for anyone younger.

Krampus comes to town, all (cold) hell breaks loose and fast.Solid performances by everyone, but bonus props to CGI and practical effects. Really, monsters look great, in design and execution. Sound design is also excellent.Maybe the biggest flaw is that it's kinda predictable and not entirely original but the execution of the movie is on point in any case. Characters are a bit stereotypical suburban family vs dumb rednecks but cast did their part mostly good so that's not big of a deal anyway.As for the runtime, hour and a half, just enough, not too long and not too short.As you may have guessed - recommendation from me for this version of Krampus.",Krampus
147,NDbportmanfan,Not Scary or All That Funny but Still an Interesting Story,7,10 October 2016,"Krampus is about a family who is trying to survive their relatives for the holidays. When they reach a breaking point, the younger boy makes a wish that releases the spirit of Krampus. The family must try and work together to face the onslaught of creatures at the spirits disposal.I know this movie isn't winning any big awards for the dialogue between the characters or anything but I couldn't look away. The story was too interesting as the implementation of the monsters were well done. They also looked great especially the jack in the box, that creature might solely be a reason to check this movie out if anything. The pacing and flow of the events that transpired felt right as there was hardly any place in the movie where I was yelling at the screen to get on with it.Of course with the typical B movie type movie this is, plot holes will be made and this movie has a few so just be warned in that regard. Also not all the characters felt like they belonged in the family. I know that was the point of the conflict but one character stood out. The writers seemed like they had to include the folklore which is the correct move but it felt odd coming in this way.This movie is probably only for certain audiences as I can't see this getting wide appeal. Looking at the rating currently at a 6.2 it seems like this film will be one of those cult classic movies that will go under the radar. I think this movie is only for fans of... well maybe lighter horror like what the Gremlins or the lesser know movie Dolls. People who also find the Krampus folklore will also get a kick out of this as it seems like a faithful adaption into a movie.",Krampus

150,samgiannn,Krampus (2015),6,25 December 2015,"2015 has been a fairly good year for horror in my eyes, and Krampus does at least a decent job in ending the year. It's the first Christmas-themed horror film in a long time, so it does give some variety for horror fans. Krampus is based on Germanic folklore of Santa's horned little helper who punishes the bad children on Christmas day. One boy has given up hope on Christmas when their obnoxious in-laws come to town. A freak snowstorm knocks out the power and barricades the family in their house. They have evoked the wrath of Krampus, who sends demonic toys and elves to terrorize the family. Fans of silly horror movies like Gremlins or Slither should find a lot to like in Krampus, although those looking for a good scare might be slightly disappointed. The movie takes a long time to really get to the good stuff, not really building any suspense but just watching banter among the family. However, it does allow all of the characters to be memorable and fleshed out. When Krampus' Minions finally do show up, the movie goes nuts. Practical and digital effects are used for the toys, making them look more real and creepy. A giant jack-in-the-box toy in particular is the stuff of nightmares. Krampus never gets particularly scary, but that's made up for by its silliness, memorable characters and fun plot. It should make a good annual Christmas viewing if you're not into Frosty the Snowman.",Krampus
151,johnplocar,"If you love ""Gremlins"" then you'll love this...",8,21 December 2015,"""Krampus"": Just a few days prior I saw one of the worst horror- comedies I had ever seen in my entire life. Again I say, I hate you ""Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse""! Last night, however, I saw easily one of the best and will definitely end up being my new Christmas classic to watch every year. Directed by Michael Dougherty, the man who wrote and directed ""Trick 'r Treat"", he now brings us a story about this dysfunctional family being stuck in a house together during a snow storm while the Krampus and his minions start terrorizing them. This movie was nothing short of awesome; the movie is drenched in Christmas atmosphere in the same way ""Trick 'r Treat"" engulfed itself completely in the season of Halloween. While I don't believe ""Trick 'r Treat"" was a great movie, it was still a decent directorial debut. This, however, is legitimately a fantastic movie. I loved it; it was equal parts hilarious as well as downright creepy! I honestly don't want to get too much more into it because it's something that you just have to see for yourself. So if you decide to read on, there won't be many spoilers but I still say just go see itstill here? Okay. The story, for me anyways, was pretty unpredictable. There were a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming at all; for instance, kids just straight up dying in this movie. It doesn't get gruesome with its kills, but this is a case where the PG-13 rating didn't get in the way of the movie succeeding because this felt exactly in the same vein as a holiday horror movie like ""Gremlins"". It felt very reminiscent of that movie quite a bit actually, not in the sense that I felt like it was a rip-off, but more inspired by if you know what I mean. Including the feeling of the holidays in every frame of the movie while not easing up on how dark the story can get where anyone can simply be killed off at any point in time. In the 1980s this would have been a PG, and it still would have been amazing. There are plenty of cases where this obviously borderlines on becoming an R, but not to where it's distracting, although at times extremely shocking instead. If there ends up being an R rated cut of this once it hits video I wouldn't mind seeing it. I don't think that it would make it a better movie, but it would still be an interesting watch. The characters are something I need to touch on because in the first five minutes of the movie there were a couple of moments where I was getting worriedthe reason I say that is because they were getting dangerously close to being unlikable and I was thinking that if this movie turns into something where I am only wishing for them to die the whole time then this is going to be one miserable piece of s--t. Luckily, it was only for a few moments that they acted like jerks to one another, but in a way that made sense. And only within the first five minutes of the movie, after that they all start actually working together, bonding and are really humanized once this snow storm hits and especially after they have to start fighting against the Krampus and his little creepy toy monsters. Speaking of the effects in this movie are astonishing. I mean truly gorgeous and creative; the creature designs and animatronics and costumes were a true work of art. You see in the trailer just a quick glimpse of what the movie has in store in those regards and it is amazing. The Krampus himself was something that made me practically crap my pants on the spot once he was revealed. I'm not going to describe what he looks like, that's part of the fun when you watch this movie. Seeing it just happen in front of me was sheer joy. Even when they use CGI it never felt out of place, they used it only when they absolutely had to and they made it look good. I haven't gone to see a movie twice in a movie theater since 2012, and that really wasn't necessarily my choice, it just kind of happened; this movie I would totally be willing to see again in the theater. I sadly wasn't able to see ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" from this year in the theater again, so I hope that I can get the chance to see this one again before it leaves theaters. That should give you a good idea on how much I loved this movie, ""Krampus"" and ""Fury Road"" are the only movies I wanted to see multiple times in the cinema in the last several years. So to wrap this up; the story was exciting, the characters became people I liked and were funny and easy to route for, the effects were great, the art direction was gorgeous, big laughs and creepy imagery scattered from beginning to end. I had a blast at this movie. If you love movies like ""Gremlins"", ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"", ""Black Christmas"", ""Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale"", ""Elves"", or ""Christmas Evil"" then you'll have fun at this movie. Ridiculous plot with a dark twist on the holiday season, it's just great. I knew that I would probably love this movie just from the opening credit sequence alone. PLEASE GO SEE THIS!",Krampus
152,dhainline1,Be Good for Goodness' Sake!,10,8 December 2015,"In German myth, Krampus is a horned, non-human entity who is Santa Claus's opposite in every conceivable way. He punishes naughty children and leaves nice children alone. The Engel family is a German-American family that consists of Tom (Adam Scott), Sarah (Toni Collette), young son Max (Emjay Anthony) teen daughter Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen), and Omi (German for Grandma-Krista Stadler). This family is getting ready for Christmas and the dreaded holiday visit from Sarah's sister, Linda (Allison Tolman), BIL Howard, (David Koechner), twin daughters Stevie (Lolo Owen) and Jordan (Queenie Samuel), son Howard, Jr. aka Howie (Maverick Flack) and baby daughter, Crissy. Every visit with the in-laws is hell on earth for this poor family. Howard is a white-trash gun nut who is raising his 2 daughters to be tomboys and his son to be a pro football player. This year, they bring along hyper critical Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). The trouble starts when Max's cousins find out he still believes in Santa Claus and Stevie snatches the boy's letter to Santa from him and reads it out loud to the whole family. Max tries and succeeds in getting the letter back after wrestling the twins for it. He says he hates Christmas, he hates them, and he wants Christmas to be like how it used to be. Max runs up to his room and Tom tries to console him. This doesn't go over well. Max rips up the letter to Santa Claus and tosses it out the window. Suddenly, a blizzard blows through the neighborhood and the power goes out. After this you are left with 12 family members who are at each others' throats and the Krampus and his minions come to punish them for being naughty. Omi stops speaking German in order to tell her family in English what the Krampus is and shows them the bauble the creature left her when she was a little girl who stopped believing in Santa Claus and wanted her parents to vanish. Krampus doesn't give, instead he grabs the naughty and drags them to his underworld. This was an exciting, scary movie that teaches a good lesson to have faith in Santa Claus and Christmas or otherwise Krampus and his minions will come with punishment in mind. All the actors were great, especially Adam Scott as the kind father, Toni Collette as the mother who wants to have a nice Christmas for her kids, David Koechner as the boorish uncle, Allison Tolman as the aunt who doesn't control her kids, and Conchetta Ferrell as the very critical, scathing Aunt Dorothy! Special mention is given to the younger actors especially Emjay Anthony as the young boy who still believes in Santa Claus and wants his family to get along desperately.The Krampus was quite real and quite scary and so were his minions. No wonder the song says for all to ""be good for goodness' sake""! I recommend this movie as a Christmas horror movie that teaches the viewer to be a nice person and not just on Christmas!",Krampus
153,TeenVamp,Wishes it was Gremlins...fails miserably,1,7 December 2015,"I had high hopes for Krampus , but from the beginning I could tell it would be way more cheesy than scary...boy was I right. I didn't find one single scene creepy or scary and the character development was non existent. The silhouette of Krampus with his devil horns looked pretty good but later on all the buildup is destroyed as soon as you see his face with his mouth open a foot wide just like every other CG monster of the last 20 years. Yawn. As soon as the CG gingerbread men showed up looking like rejects from a Pixar movie and sounding like Joe Dante's giggling GREMLINS I realized I was watching something that should have been direct to DVD. It felt like a made for TV kids fantasy movie. Instead of dread,chills, or even the old standby GORE we get slapstick, unlikable characters, and evil toys that look like rejects from a Puppet Master sequel. Michael Dougherty should stick to writing crappy superhero scripts and stop directing ""horror"" movies.",Krampus
154,KingBrian1,A fairy Tale Horror,9,26 April 2017,The movie should have been made decades early. The Germanic fairy tale of a creature that kills children who don't believe in Santa Claus has all the makings of a horror movie and this film does not disappoint. As someone who is not a fan of gratuitous violence this film is truly a great horror. It combines comedy with freakish sets and monsters. Yet somehow it is not fully a horror but a Christmas Classic for all those people who want to ditch Christmas and embrace the anti Christmas spirit well welcome to the world of the Krampus. The tale itself is frightening but i have to give a lot of credit to the designers of the props and sets in this film. The conclusion is also epic.,Krampus
155,jerralagbayani,This film made me realize I ought to believe in Santa!,6,9 January 2018,"Movies like this need to be more around as the future progresses and with remakes upon remakes maybe one day people will treasure this film more than they treasure, let's say It.
Basically after a kid proclaims he wishes there was no Christmas he throws his Christmas List into the cold winter sky, embracing a storm. After a series of events they realize a figure from mythology, Krampus, comes to haunt them, showing the terror of Santa's twin's wrath on camera.
This film should really be a cult classic and should be as well known as Jeepers Creepers or maybe even Insidious.
What brought me down was somewhat of a lack of action with occasional jokes every now and then and maybe a momentary jump scare that isn't surprising.
What I did like was it's feeling in holidays and how it kept that feeling throughout.",Krampus
156,gooseshaw,"A fun, creative, and well-made modern-day Christmas fairytale.",8,1 April 2020,"I watched this movie on Christmas Eve of last year to get me into the Christmas spirit (I wrote this review a while ago). While the movie isn't joyful, it till manages to make you feel like you're actually watching a Christmas movie. The movie is a horror, though it will likely only manage to scare children. Still, the costume design is fantastic - the creatures here are comparable to those in Pan's Labyrinth (2006).I have to say, I was a little worried as the movie got closer to the end. Honestly, I was afraid they'd go with an obvious and clichéd happy ending where the whole family gets to come back and it's all as if nothing ever happened. The movie
does end this way, but not exactly as I had pictured it. Instead the camera falls back to reveal that the family, who is now alive and enjoying their Christmas as they should be, is stuck inside a snow globe within Krampus' cave, presumably so that they can relive Christmas over and over as a family - a twisted version of the protagonist's wish. This unexpected ending provides a nice twist that turns a cliché into a nice little fairy tale ending, well suited for this Christmas story.I would absolutely recommend this movie if they're looking for a fun time around the holiday season.",Krampus
157,asandor,Hilarious Christmas Horror Film?,7,23 November 2016,"Krampus is a horror/comedy Christmas film. A genre buster it is, but it is most certainly worth a watch. The story follows a young boy, Max, who is having a bit of a bad Christmas season. His parents are fighting, his sister growing older and more distant. And his Aunts family, a group or red necks who love guns, drinking, and fighting, have come to town. After he has had enough, Max tears up his letter to Santa, in frustration over the holiday season. Unfortunately, this summons Krampus, a demon anti-Santa who comes to take Max's family to Hell. What follows is a comedic Christmas/horror, that is quite a good time.As mentioned, this is more comedy than horror. The family dynamic is overblown to the point of satire. The horror is gimmicky and self-referencing. This film is just plain fun. The horror aspects are fairly weak (one of the lesser points of the film) but this is more to due with the tongue in cheek humour over anything else.This film also features some excellent sound design and visuals. The CGI was weak in the film, but the practical effects used in the costume were fantastic. Krampus and his minions are very creepy looking, channelling the folkloric look of films like Pan's Labyrinth, and nailing the German Paganistic origins of Krampus while making it accessible to unfamiliar audiences. The sound in the film was also excellent. The reverberating thumps of Krampus on the roof, the snarls and demonic sounds, were all deep and resounding. The howling wind of the unnatural snowstorm adds excellent background and setting.I really enjoyed this film quite a bit. It was suitably funny to work well as a comedy, and although the horror was not heart stopping, it tapped the feeling of films like Poltergeist; it was more outrageous than spooky, and mixed the two genres well enough to work. The addition of excellent sound, practical effects, and the humour the cast and story brought to bear, made this a fun and highly watchable film for the holiday season. If you are getting sick of watching the Grinch over and over, give this one a try for a refreshing and fun holiday film.",Krampus
158,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,My new favourite Christmas movie,7,3 December 2015,"As a person who is generally not a big fan of the stress the Christmas holidays bring nor the usual movies based on it, Krampus is so refreshing to watch. Krampus is a German folklore character who has been gaining popularity recently with shows like American Dad. So it would be natural that he gets his own movie.The movie starts out like Home Alone/Christmas Vacation with the bickering family having to spend Christmas together which includes the in- laws (Adam Scott and David Koechner) and sisters (Toni Collete and Allison Tolman) who don't get along, the mean cousins and the alcoholic, cursing aunt (Conchata Ferrell). It is when the film's main kid Max (Emjay Anthony) decides to give up on Christmas that it summons the movie's monster Krampus. It then goes from Christmas Vacation to a dark fantasy.What I admire about the film is how it explores that Christmas today has been commercialized to look like this perfect holiday where everyone just gets along but when really it has become a very stressful time of the year. The slow motion opening sequence clearly explains. It delves on a good balance of both comedy, horror and Christmas spirit. There are plenty of moments where you will chuckle and laugh. Many of the horror scenes are not too scary but they can really give you chills and sometimes become very disturbing despite it is PG-13. But the humour and comedy never loses the Christmas message of looking past people's fault and learning to care and sacrifice.I give a huge credit to the screenplay and actors. All of the actors (including Emjay Anthony) give great performances that are complimented by the great writing that fleshes out these characters. In the beginning you can understand why Krampus has come punish most of these despicable people. But when they are forced bond and work through there issues, you really do begin to care if these people make it or not.But the biggest positive I can give this movie is Krampus and his minions. Krampus has less screen time then I would of preferred but his presence and arrival is executed so well. He at first appears as a mysterious shadowy figure stalking people from the rooftops but when he finally comes down the chimney (more like brakes through it) you see he is a nightmare version of Santa that will look down at you with huge dark eyes and a ghoulish face. Every part about the character's design is unique. Some of the other creature designs are well-done too. You have Krampus's version of elves and toys that look like they came out of The Nightmare Before Christmas like a giant carnivorous Jack-in-the-box, a killer teddy bear and some psychopathic gingerbread men. Aside from Krampus, the Jack-in-the-box was my favourite creature. And pretty much 90% of the creatures is this movie are practical effects which is good to have in a horror movie. And the finale is probably the most twisted happy ending you can give to a Christmas movie. There was one final scene that scared me the most then I ever have had.If are tired of watching the same run of the mill Christmas movie and want to see one that explores the darker side of Christmas that today's culture is too afraid to tell, then Krampus is the right kind of movie to see. It is also a good treat to have before Star Wars Force Awakens comes out.",Krampus
159,ryanmark-57919,Christmas Movies are Getting Weird,8,6 December 2015,"Wow, another movie that I liked a lot more than I thought I would. This is actually a really fun film and I agree with the moral behind the story. In case you're wondering, the moral is the same one that we hear about in many of the classic Christmas movies. Don't be selfish and give what you can to others. The lesson is similar to many other Christmas films but the movie itself is totally different. Michael Dougherty did a pretty good job on this one and I highly recommend it to anyone that's looking for a different kind of Christmas film.The story follows a young boy named Max (Emjay Anthony) and his family during one particularly difficult holiday season. Max's family don't exactly get along and this is true even during Christmas. Max's whole extended family show up but none of them like each other and they're making Max miserable. Max tries to overcome his unhappiness and embrace the joy he feels during the holidays but his family just keeps pushing him and pushing him until he reaches his limit. Max decides to reject his positive feelings and ends up accidentally summoning a demon named Krampus. Krampus is kind of like Santa's shadow. Santa represents happiness and joy while Krampus punishes those that don't embrace the Christmas spirit. Unfortunately for Max and his family, they're next on Krampus's list.They actually went with comedic actors for this movie which surprised me at first since I didn't really think it was a comedy at first. It does have a lot of funny parts to it though so I guess it's actually like a comedic horror film. Emjay Anthony does a decent job as the innocent and endearing Max. This kid really does try his best to overcome the selfishness around him but his family is making it difficult. I've seen Anthony in films before and I actually really like the kid. God knows he's much more believable than half the child actors in Hollywood. We also get some pretty good roles from Adam Scott, Toni Collette, David Koechner, and Allison Tolman. All of these people are able to bring on the comedy but are also able to act decently well. They say being funny is extremely difficult so maybe that's why so many comedic actors are able to adapt to other genres. In any case, everyone does a great job here.The atmosphere to this film works much better than I thought it would. The snowstorm really is a perfect place to set a horror movie and I'm surprised that more people haven't taken advantage of this plot point. The snow combined with night brings the visibility outside to basically nothing and makes everything seem even more spooky. The few times we see Krampus is either outside in the snowstorm or in the dark so he remains mysterious throughout the entire film. He doesn't do much of the dirty work himself and instead allows his minions to do the capturing of children and whatnot. The toys and elves are actually really inventive and scary looking for the most part. The Jack in the Box is especially terrifying just because of his looks and what he does to the children when he gets to them. The Gingerbread men are the most plain looking out of the minions but they're used so effectively in one particularly goofy scene that I really wasn't disappointed.I really can't think of too many complaints to make about the movie. I guess the cgi wasn't that impressive but it really didn't bother me any. I suppose the scenes were tame for a horror movie but even the lack of blood didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film. It's not exactly groundbreaking or anything like that but the movie is just really fun and a unique take on the classic Christmas film. I don't think it'll be for everyone but I would easily recommend it to those looking for a weird horror comedy hybrid film.",Krampus
160,bartonj2410,You better watch out cos it ain't Santa Claus coming to town this year,7,5 December 2015,"Every year around this time we get a few new releases that are centred around the Christmas holidays. It's no surprise really as Christmas is one of the most profitable times of the year however, the trouble is that most of these films normally follow the same formula and end up being rather quite boring. There are films however, that stray away from the norm and Krampus is certainly one of those. Yes, it involves a dysfunctional family coming together for Christmas but with an Alpine folklore twist thrown in for good measure, it certainly makes things a little bit more interesting.Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette) are parents in a family hosting Christmas for their relatives. When Sarah's sister, Linda (Allison Tolman) and her husband Howard (David Koechner), arrive for the holiday, it is clear that they don't always see eye to eye.Tempers begin to flare and when Max (Emjay Anthony), Tom and Sarah's son, makes a Christmas wish, all hell breaks loose as Krampus, an ancient spirit that punishes those who lose the true meaning of Christmas, pays them all a visit.What I loved most about Krampus is just how much it reminded me of Gremlins, with its dark comedy burying the tongue firmly in the cheek. Gremlins is one of my favourite Christmas films mainly because it goes against everything you would expect to see in one with fear taking the place of festive cheer.Krampus isn't just a copy of Gremlins though. It gets its own identity thanks to the folklore that it incorporates into the story. Michael Dougherty, Todd Casey and Zach Shields have done a great job in their writing by mixing the fantasy elements with the comedy, making Krampus a very likable piece of entertainment this holiday season.Dougherty, also the director, has spoken of his commitment to using practical effects and it's a decision that should really be applauded. They go a long way in making the horror elements of the film so effective, with the creatures looking way more realistic and disturbing than CGI ever could. I mean you just have to look at the jack-in-the-box in comparison to the gingerbread men and you will agree.Some of the jokes fail to land in the film but comedy actors such as Adam Scott and David Koechner play their part in making the most of all the jokes. There isn't one performance that hinders the film in any way, even when there are just as many child actors on show, and I have a real dislike towards child actors sometimes.So, rather than digging out Home Alone or any other Christmas film you normally watch again this year, give Krampus a go. You'll be in for either a devilish treat or a monstrous trick.",Krampus
161,TheBarleyGuy,A whole lot of fun.,7,26 February 2016,"A dip back into the 2015 pool, to a movie that I just didn't get a chance to see in theatres. Krampus is exactly what it claims to be: a Christmas time horror movie, with a giant monster version of Santa Claus. If you've seen a trailer for this one, then you really do have a good idea what you're in for. It's a dark, funny, and predominantly fun film that doesn't pretend to be anything other than that.The cast was the first indicator that this would be a movie with more elements of comedy than horror, with Adam Scott (Parks & Recreation), David Koechner (Anchorman), Allison Tolman (Fargo), Conchata Ferrell (Two and a Half Men), and Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) all add up to a pretty funny bunch to drive the movie forward. The lot of them play a family that couldn't be any more cartoonishly dysfunctional, which is the one thing that worked against this movie for me. While there are plenty of families that don't get along, the level that these people operated on, while continuing to still interact with each other, is a bit outside the realm of possibility for me. That said, they're definitely living in some kind of heightened reality, and considering the tone of the rest of the film, I quickly got over my dislike of their characters.The movie also stars Austrian actress Krista Stadler as the grandmother, Emjay Anthony (Insurgent) as a boy who misses his family and happy Christmases, and Stefania LaVie Owen (The Carrie Diaries) as the older sister who is, surprisingly, taken by Krampus very early in the movie.One of the things I liked about this movie immediately, is that it hits that sweet spot of self awareness where the tone of the movie matches the absurd tone, without spending 90% of the film winking at the camera. There are enough moments of comedy balanced with enough genuinely creepy or scary moments that there feels like a good balance. Perhaps a bit sillier than Cabin in the Woods, but not quite as silly as Tucker and Dale vs Evil (both movies that I love by the way), if that helps give it a bit of a scale.Krampus is well designed, and feels massive and intimidating in this brief moments on screen, but its his minions that will make the movie memorable, and probably a fun favourite for the holidays. His tiny, evil gingerbread men are cute and somehow menacing, his evil teddy bear and angel are effective, and probably the most bizarre and upsetting is the Jack-in-the-Box with the disgusting, wet, fleshy mouth. The monster design is a lot of fun, and even more wonderful is the fact that they exist and aren't just thrown together in a computer. There is a great incorporation of practical and digital effects, that really give this some lasting impact.Perhaps the most important moment, for me, was the ending. It definitely fakes you out, and I found myself genuinely upset up until the full reveal. It's actually a surprisingly bleak end to the film, and overall it works for me. While I'm sure some might not like it, and others might have wanted something a bit happier, there's something really satisfying about a movie that wraps up completely, even if it's not in the most positive way.On the whole, Krampus is a fun Christmas time monster movie. It's reasonably well acted, and has a really good balance of humour and scares. It's funny, and doesn't take itself too seriously which is a welcome change from so many of the self-serious crap we're forced to choke down as horror fans. Give this one a watch, it's worth the time.",Krampus
162,JontheLobsterLover,A new Christmas classic...imo,9,15 December 2015,"I knew from the very first time I viewed the trailer for Krampus that I was going to love it. The story about an darker St. Nick, that punishes the naughty kids; it's not only very clever, it's a story that likely needs to be told. That's why as I'm sitting in the theater and watching all the kids piling in with their families I was first a little irritated; however, a part of me thought ""If these kids witness what happens if you're naughty, maybe they'll start being nice."" Wishful thinking for sure, but one can hope.Anyways, back to the movie. The humor begins right off the bat as the credits roll. One of the best things about this movie is how much humor is in it, and how clever the humor gets. It's more a comedy movie with horror mixed in, instead of vice versa. The animation in the movie was incredible. All types of it, because there is more than one kind in the movie. Finally, the look of Krampus and his minions was beautifully horrific. Something nightmares are made of, and yet something to also be admired; almost in an artistic way.",Krampus
163,michaelant555,I wasn't impressed,4,27 February 2016,"I was waiting to see this film for quite a while and I had high hopes, but when I settled down to watch it, my enthusiasm eventually turned to total disappointment (about half way through)and then, for the rest of the film I couldn't really care less what happened to the cast. There was nothing here to keep my interest. There was no depth to the story or the characters and the action scenes were shot in, what I can only describe as a ""claustrophobic"" and chaotic way with no real sense of interest for the viewer. Most of the characters were so obnoxious and irritating that I didn't care if they got eaten by demons. Obviously in real life I'd have more compassion for them, but in the fantasy film world I was like, ""Yeah go on, gobble them down"". I started flicking through the internet through the second half because I was so bored. Films like Gremlins, E.T., Ghostbusters and The Goonies are classics; this film will not be. I only said that because someone on here thought it would become a cult classic, but I really don't think it will. It's too empty and one dimensional. Judge for yourself.",Krampus
164,InDyingArms,One successful horror / comedy that truly delivers!,9,5 December 2015,"A family, all together is huddled up at home with no electricity as a massive storm hits them. On Top of that, they now have the challenge of which they must fight off a supposed legend; Krampus and his helpers pick each off one, by one, leaving them to a fight for survival. First off, this will be a flat out good review regarding this film, along with it's small flaws of course. This one was successful, and succeeded in my high, hypothesis thoughts toward it. Firstly, I found this movies plot to be intriguing, and simply thrilling for the audience. We're put through a whole, white- knuckle situation of witnessing this family slowly await the arrival of Krampus, and his helpers. You sit in suspense, wondering who'll be next, or what Krampus and the others may possibly do next. This movie keeps it all a solid secret, only adding more successful suspense towards the audience. On top of that, the film keeps the audience entertained with some funny jokes, which are actually quite funny overall. The film keeps the conflicting feelings of both suspense, and dark - comedy at a 50/50, leading to an intriguing, overall plot design that keeps us entertained, thrilled, tying in a few laughs with comedically successful humor! Overall for the plot, it succeeds in something new towards the whole Krapmus legend, turning it into a more frightening, mythical - like way that, as said many times before, succeeds. For the characters we're given in this film, I personally found to be overly great. We're given a group of characters that present themselves in a parody - like way, comedically keeping up with it's Comedy - horror title. The characters aren't bad, clichéd, or really even hateful. We, as the audience grow to these characters, whether it's actual hope for them, or for the comedic hilariocity they uniquely carry. These characters stand out as unique, and play their roles in this entire movie simplistically. Same goes for the actors, these actors did an outstanding job playing their characters in a believable matter. Now for the more intriguing aspect, that being Krampus' appearance, as well as his helpers. Honestly, hats off for the design that was given for the film. This entire film, in regards of the appearances of the creatures were flat out fantastic. Krampus looked great, and overall, we actually see a good majority of him, unlike other films that just pass off small glimpses, we actually see a great portion of Krampus, overall looking, actually, quite creepy, and menacing. For his helpers, they lead to more of a comical aspect, a surprise I honestly quite liked. We're given these helpers that go for more comedy, rather than chills. Like Krampus, they looked great. And we get a great number of appearances from them. I must say, though, the one helper. The Jack - in the box, ( Not a spoiler, we see him throughout the trailer ) Was creepy, and the film only threw that out to us harder than it came. Finally, probably the only flaw I can even see in this film, the pacing. Although this film had decent, well pacing, I have to address this feeling; Around the final act of this film, it felt as if the entire movie decided to just throw everything straight at our face - It felt rushed. Everything, honestly, just blew by quite quickly, and felt off. But overall, that's probably the only, small flaw in this film. In conclusion. Great actors / characters, great pacing, amazing visual effects, nothing looked cheesy, or too CGI filled, We're given a great plot design, as well as unique aspects, and to top it all off we're given an excellent blend of comedy, as well as horror. Although the small flaw of a rushed - feel toward the end, ""Krampus"" was a highly entertaining, chilling, and thrilling film that succeeded on many levels. I felt as if the writers, and directors did a simplistic job at this one. Definitely give this film a look. It's a great film - I'd even go as far as saying it's one of the best of 2015. And that's saying a lot - Highly recommended. Check it out, you'll have a blast!",Krampus

I understand that they tried to get a family-horror style to it, but in the end its very clearly just one of those. When its a family scene it is just that and the same goes for horror too.If you can get past it, you will have a movie full of good performances (especially Toni's one), great end and some pretty creepy monsters.Not recommended for a family viewing, but you can watch it with your friends during Christmas period.",Krampus

Each of the cast does a good job portraying their characters even if the characters are not the friendliest people in the world. The practical effects are terrific and are a huge relief from all the CGI these days. Even though I don't hate CGI, a lot of filmmakers tend to overuse it these days. This film only used CGI when necessary which is something that most filmmakers should learn.I only have 2 problems hence why I gave this an 8 and that is the ending is kind of weak and not every joke worked for me, but that's it. This film is a really good throwback to the 80s with a really good cast, script, story and great practical effects.

167,tyingling7766,Krampus Review,7,24 April 2017,"Anyone who goes into this movie disappointed by the end clearly didn't know what they were watching. I knew exactly what the movie was once I heard about it. So I wasn't disappointed. Stick around and see what I thought.Synopsis: When his dysfunctional family clashes over the holidays, young Max is disillusioned and turns his back on Christmas. Little does he know, this lack of festive spirit has unleashed the wrath of Krampus: a demonic force of ancient evil intent on punishing non- believers. All hell breaks loose as beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous life of their own, laying siege to the fractured family's home and forcing them to fight for each other if they hope to survive. Starring: Adam Scott, Toni Collette Director: Michael DoughertyThis movie was made as a comedy/horror from the jump. Notice which word I put first there. There is a reason I did that. The director made this movie in the right way.I never thought this was going to be an instant classic. It is one of those movies that could have a cult following in a few years, just like Dougherty last movie Trick 'r Treat.The movie is quite enjoyable. The major problem with the movie is the fact the studios wouldn't sign off on it unless it was rated PG- 13. This is one of those movies where the rating does hurt the movie more than it helped it. Yes, it did allow for a larger audience, but that is becoming a moot point. I saw parents taking their kids into Deadpool, and my misses saw moms taking their kids into Magic Mike.There is a lot of comedy in this movie. Not so much horror, but more comedy. There is even more action than horror in this movie. Of course, that is action towards evil objects.I want you to notice I didn't mention the acting. There is a reason for that. The movie wasn't about the acting. And the actors know that. They played their roles the right way as well.Final Thoughts: This movie was made an anti-Christmas movie. It doesn't matter when you watch, but you do need to watch it. It's not the best movie out there, but it's worth it.Rating: 7 out of 10That's it for me folks.",Krampus

Me and my nephew watched it the other day because we wanted to watch something for the Christmas season and this wasn't it.The story is about this family who is trying to be the all American perfect family around Christmas time but it doesn't turn out that way when their relatives come in from out of town and causes hell for the little kid who just wants to have Christmas like he used to when he was a kid and have a normal holiday. Well he writes a letter to Santa but his snotty cousins make fun of him for it and he goes nuts saying he hates Christmas and tears up his letter and wishes that his family would go away, basically Home Alone but without the criminal coming in and breaking in and stealing stuff.

Hopefully he'll end up in something better than this in future.Krampus...Anyone saying this is a great film or proclaiming that it'll be a future cult movie needs to be slapped in the face with a wet turkey. This is an utterly run of the mill, clichéd attempt at a family-friendly 'horror', with cardboard characters (the adults that is, as I mentioned the kids are fairly believable) and hackneyed script and storyline. It gets very boring very quickly as you realise the film will never improve, and in fact gets drastically worse when the power goes out.

171,lev-nemkin,Krampus does not disappoint...,8,28 December 2016,Krampus is a movie that definitely does not disappoint and it really makes you not want to ever lose your Christmas spirit if you've seen it you know what it's about a young boy wishes that he could have a nice Christmas with his family again that it would go back to normal instead of them arguing all the time but instead he summons an ancient demon who is there to punish him for losing his Christmas spirit which he kind of did because in the movie he tears up his letter to Santa Claus which he wrote that's why Krampus came and from then on it's a nightmare for the boy and his family this is a great mix of horror and comedy as well Michael Dougherty definitely did do a great job the idea of an ancient Christmas demon who comes to punish and not to reward is kind of terrifying to me I never knew about the legend of Krampus until I heard about this movie it actually is a legend there are stories about him. The acting in this is awesome as well I mean there was not a moment of bad acting in this I was hesitant to watch this movie because I was afraid I might not like it but I ended up being surprised at how much I did and Krampus just looked really terrifying I mean I got chills down my spine when they showed him on screen. I definitely would recommend this movie if you haven't seen it yet this is definitely a Christmas horror movie that doesn't disappoint.,Krampus
172,funbaggs,Loved it and hated it at the same time,8,2 September 2018,Good all around film with some lack of direction acting by some peeps who should have been in other roles not this films roles.

173,MissOceanB,When Toys Attack...Great Film!,7,1 March 2016,"This movie certainly peaked my interest. At first you may think ""Oh, another Christmas-time scary horror film"" as I did but it is so much more than that. It has a great cast, great storyline based on an ancient legend, and I can't quite compare it to any other Horror film I have seen in the recent past. The story begins like most Christmas-themed films, family arriving for the Holidays, decorations, lots of food, comedic remarks and such. Krampus is not terribly horrific, but there are a few jumpy and creepy moments (of course, this depends on your personal taste). There isn't a dull moment in the film, it goes by quite quickly and has some interesting features that one would not expect. The ending was well done. Krampus is worth seeing, at any time of year!",Krampus
174,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,I Guess the Evil Easter Bunny is Next.,7,5 December 2015,"Krampus is directed by Michael Dougherty and written by Todd Casey, Michael Dougherty, and Zach Shields. It stars Adam Scott, Toni Collette, Emjay Anthony, David Koechner, Allison Tolman, and Krista Stadler.A boy who has a bad Christmas ends up accidentally summoning a Christmas demon, known as Krampus into his family home.I am a big fan of Micheal Daughertys works. Before he sprang into his directorial debut he wrote the phenomenal X2 and the respectable, if a bit dull, Superman Returns. Though I admire his work in both movies, Trick r' Treat is by far his best work. With a keen mix of intelligently crafted thrills and darkly comic sequences, he crafted a non-linear horror-comedy that stands out as one of the best in the genre. So I was naturally pumped for Krampus, his sophomore film. Thankfully, my expectations were met and I really enjoyed Krampus. With that said this movie feels like it was written in three, very, different segment joined together in a linear plot but never really meshed well.The first act or first segment feels a lot like a sharply written satire that deals a lot with materialism and the interpretation of what a holiday truly means. This segment sets up all the characters, from the most delightful types to the more unsavory ones extremely well. This part also sets up its odd premise and can best me described as gleefully mean-spirited. This is the best part by far.The second act or second segment is a clichéd drama that harbors some inventive thrills that involve a chimney and an intriguing story back story of one of the side characters. The writers get a bit too carried away in this segment, demonstrating their knack for character development in the expense of original story telling. A lot of this segment feels recycled and highly unlikely, even for a horror movie, especially the events leading up to the said chimney sequence. With that said, however, this segment transforms all the living characters established in Act One into sympathetic individuals who we, the audience, can root for. Before I delve into the third segment, there were two aspects of the film that remained untarnished up until that point in the film. These two were the direction and acting.Dougherty's sure hand direction was absolute privilege to see on the silver screen. Making the active decision amplify the sound of movement and to conceal Krampus' face until the very end made for a truly terrifying antagonist. Dougherty also masterfully used moving shots to demonstrate the tension the characters were facing. Dougherty does his job in ghoulish style.The acting was also phenomenal, by horror movie standards. Led by a perfect performance by Adam Scott the whole cast demonstrates a barrage of emotions in an almost spitfire kind of way. Hard to hate and easy to adore, Tom, the family man whose household is being tormented by Krampus, is brought to life by Scott and is channeled into a truly believable character who reaches his highly emotion core in segment three. The other actor who really stood out was Emjay Anthony. Proving to be one of the best child performances of the year, Anthony demonstrates a level of terror and eventual courage not seen in any child, horror, performance this year.Now on to the third act or third segment which is strictly campy horror. This is most entertaining segment but is also possibly the most flawed. Though occasionally overly campy to plain silliness this segment pulls its self back into place in some awesome and emotional scenes. With a great climax and some gory fun, it was really disappointing to see how unearned the ending was. With no reference or foreshadowing, the ending, though intriguing and unpredictable, was ultimately completely out of place.Krampus is a deftly directed and well acted even if it is rather uneven in the writing department. Krampus gets a B+ or a 7/10.",Krampus

176,Jack-Wareing-Films,Next GREAT HORROR CHRISTMAS Movie Classic...,8,29 April 2020,"KRAMPUS took a few views for me to start to like/appreciate it. I think this is one of those movies that need a few (maybe 5 - 10 years) to be fully appreciated. I thought it was lousy/terrible on first viewing, but by the year 2020 I have come to appreciate it a lot more. Despite the poor writing the tone is pretty cool, and most of the Special Creature/Gore FX pretty are well done. IDKY but I have grown to like this movie over time. PLUS, also IMHO Conchata Ferrell is an awesome character actress (i.e. Two and Half Men)",Krampus

178,thatpunkadam,Uses crude characters of genre trope to highlight seasonal spirit,7,12 December 2015,"The easy route henceforth would exploit satisfaction in watching the purposely-profane relatives gruesomely fall victim to a collection of Christmas killers. However, where Krampus succeeds strongest is using the genre trope of unlikable characters to its thematic advantage. Bolstered by a realistically reactionary approach – lightened by the believably brash humor of Koechner's character, though a completely straight edged Scott is a tad disappointing – a progressive feeling of previously unimaginable allies is refreshingly palpable, and fitting within the season of togetherness.Though held in check by a more marketable PG-13 rating, Krampus' league of hellish holiday haunters are imaginatively wild and meticulously rendered, even if a headache- inducing strobe eats up more screen time than we see the monsters do people. But visual kudos should also be rightly reserved for the sound and effects department—not to mention the culturally dark animated origin of Max's grandmother's (Krista Stadler) young encounter with Krampus. Layering the storm's merciless howl and Krampus' clanging chains amidst the claustrophobic blizzard, the enveloping whiteout manages to hold its own against this year's Everest and Crimson Peak. Conversely, if our characters learned the true fate of their conditions as we learn in the film's closing minutes it would have eased the pain of the cop- out and draw more attention to the excellent atmospheric effects.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2015/12/13/krampus-2015-review-indieadam/",Krampus
179,larrymeers,mediocre and funny at times,5,19 August 2016,"So Krampus focuses on a dysfunctional family that clashes over the holidays, while a boy named max has lost his Xmas spirit and accidentally summons an ancient demon to his home, once Krampus arrives they must hope to fight for each other to survive. first the pros. So i really liked the approach this film took, a monster attacks a family and they must protect each other. The film also knew when to be serious and funny. Its also very cool when you get to see krampus. he looks very terrifying and menacing. there is a part in the movie where he is chasing a girl, while he is jumping from rooftop to rooftop, and i really liked that scene because it described the monster ""creepy"" they also put a lot of detail in the minions. but now the cons. Krampus only has a limited amount of screen time and that's sad because if your going to show a new character, you don't under show him because we don't really get to experience that character. The film is pretty predictable near the 2nd and 3rd act, and the ending was just dumb. So i was sad to find out i didn't like this film because i thought it would be the next gremlins, but no it wasn't. So overall krampus isn't good nor terrible, but instead right in between. its a decent horror comedy film.",Krampus
180,nicholaskutzin,Not as bad as I expected...,7,31 July 2020,"Going into this movie, I did not have high hopes. I assumed the plot would be stupid and the characters would be one-sided. Boy, was I wrong. Not only did I end up liking most of the characters, but I found the acting to be exactly what it need to be: Funny at times and dramatic at times. The effects were not as good as I would have liked, but they get the job done. I found all the creatures to be a little cute but also a little terrifying, which is perfect. My only problem is you barely see Krampus himself. This was great for a PG-13 horror movie and I would watch it again.",Krampus
181,tarynabryant,I love this movie,10,25 September 2020,"I first saw this movie when it was released in theaters and didn't think too much of it. I thought it was entertaining but nothing super special. However, after purchasing the DVD for the sole purpose of adding it to my horror collection, I began watching it more and more and came to realize how much I actually enjoy it. For one, it's pretty funny. Plus, I find the story of Krampus very interesting, so it's fun to see it come to life on the big screen. It's a great watch for both Christmas and Halloween time. Also, the fact that Toni Collette is in it certainly doesn't hurt. What I like most about this movie is that it has substance and character. The story and development is definitely beyond surface-level and you're unlikely to find another movie like it. It's a refreshing watch. It was definitely better than other horror movies that were released around the same time (The Boy, The Forest, etc.)",Krampus
182,SeakDub,"Average Storytelling, Not Much Else",6,12 January 2017,"Dark comedies are my go getter. Won't shy away from them. Took awhile to watch it but finally got around to it. And in the end it was just an average/decent film. I feel like they could have had a grand slam movie but it ended up short. By the end I had to give it a 6/10 for it had good elements to the movie but could have been so much more. It was sort of a bland movie were you forget you're watching a dark comedy/horror. And kind of just go along with the story. A Christmas/creature feature flick that is neither scary or laughable. Basically what it comes down too. For the Christmas part of it I think it did an excellent job of that. Especially adding the Christmas music when it got intense or the family bonding moments. But don't expect it to be a family Christmas movie now. Even when it had the Christmas feel, family trouble, music, and all other things you'll expect to see. You start to wonder if you turned on National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989). But then we get the folklore of Krampus.Krampus, an evil Santa. Or justice to families who just don't have the Christmas spirit. Very incredible job and special effects on Krampus himself. From the sound effects making him sound pretty epic to the way he moves about and looks. I was quite impressed. He sure does give you an extra chill run down your spine upon watching him. That is were the good sort of ends. I was expecting some comedy, cool side creatures, action, or nail biting moments, and scares! But you don't get anything like that. It had moments that were suppose to be just that, then fell flat. Some of the other creatures were cool (mainly just one) the others lame. The jokes/puns and action sort of felt eh. And of course the cliché grandma knows the back story of the so called Krampus. Which at least seems to be understandable, but left me with a few questions. I was expecting all sorts of exciting moments but not having any of it hit a home run for me. I was dreading the ending. The typical horror ending you always get. BAD! Although the ending came and I didn't hate. It felt fine. Like it belonged to a movie of this nature. It was cheesy and it seemed like it was going to end where the viewers weren't going to be satisfied. The very last minutes I think filled that spot. Not good enough to leave pleased but accept it.So from the beginning and jump to the end. That should have been the movie, a short story perhaps. The middle could have done without and would've been much better. In conclusion with it being a 6/10, average to me, only check this movie out during the Christmas time if you feeling sort of Christmas like or horror(truly not scary.) Otherwise it isn't a movie I would recommend to people's viewing. Not a must see and in a way feels a below average thanks to bland and unfunny jokes.",Krampus
183,WilliamOTyler,"This Krampus is fun, but very tame",7,14 December 2015,"Director Michael Dougherty returns to the screen with another holiday tale, but this time he leaves the scares of Halloween behind to reinvent the story of the ancient dark side of the Christmas season. Krampus does a great job of setting a certain mood through the first act of the film. The opening credits sequence is great, laying the groundwork for both the comedy and the horror that is to come. By the time snowfall covers the neighborhood, and you're into the thick of the frost and the snowmen, you've gathered that this will be a chilling tale.Suddenly, though, the film introduces aspects that quickly cheapen it, setting you up, instead, for a completely different ride and never really letting the nice buildup from the beginning pay off.The cast pulls it all off well enough. True shrills come from Toni Collette and her film daughter Stefania LaVie Owen while you'll love to hate David Koechner and Adam Scott keeps the heart of the family sincere. And while everyone has their moments of jokes, the film doesn't quite find that great balance between horror and comedy, like its predecessor Gremlins. There are some great moments of fear and definitely some laughs, but it seems to go from one extreme to the other. Then there are moments where it is unclear whether the laugh is intentional or not, which just makes it a little awkward.The design of the film is its highlight. The cold and moody atmosphere immediately jumps out at you, and feels rightfully frostbitten. Krampus himself is an interesting twist that works with this movie, creating even more mystery around the character and implying more back story just through his clothing. His minions are all visually interesting enough, though that may be all that they have going for them. A high point is actually an animated sequence that seems to allow the style to let loose and do the things it really wants to do in the rest of the film. There are a few engaging scenes that really do deserve a spotlight, but the movie as a whole is still a little weak.Coming off the heels of Trick 'r Treat for Dougherty, which became an instant classic for its holiday and masterfully weaves several stories in and out of each other, this film struggles all over the place with telling just it's one story. Perhaps the director is better at creating his own mythology than interpreting an existing one. Maybe there is also a play of too many hands in the pot, as this is a very Americanized telling of Krampus, with cutesy monsters and gingerbread men added in. While it reeks of big studio mandates to appease a bigger audience, it's hard to decipher whether that is true, or whether it's a cash in on the successful cuteness of Trick 'r Treat's Sam, or whether it is both of these ideas. It's not fully successfully done here, but it's an overall fun time even if not really as scary as a Krampus movie should be. One thing is for sure: that Guillermo del Toro inspired Jack in the Box will creep into your memory long after the movie is over.",Krampus
184,kyyankee,A meandering journey to a terrific finish,7,7 December 2020,"Way too much exposition up front. Your extended family is a nightmare, thanks we get it. Take out 20 minutes. Krampus is coming to get you and he has creepy helpers. We get it. Take out 10 minutes. You're left with a solid hour of horror. And then keep a really imginative finish.

185,mccabegabe,Funny Mix of Christmas and Monsters,8,20 November 2021,The setup is the classic Christmas scenario: the extended family gathering that everyone dreads.

186,ghostjunk,Twisted Christmas Fun,6,25 December 2015,"Having recently lost his Christmas spirit and formed bitterness towards his family, a young boy unintentionally summons the wrath of a vicious demon to his home for the holidays.For the first time in what feels like decades, we're fortunate enough to have something fresh and new come out from the shadows and surprise us. Unlike many of the countless reboots that are coming at us, like a flock of seagulls chasing after food, Krampus offers something that any film enthusiast could appreciate: originality. Sure, the character might be based on ancient Eastern European folklore, but who are we kidding? I'm pretty sure that most of us in North America have never heard of this legend beforehand, which makes it feel as fresh as putting on a clean pair of socks straight out of the dryer. Just don't expect to feel too warm and fuzzy when this terrifying shadow comes to town.What makes Krampus so effective is its intentional throwback to old-school horror mixed with the tone of a family Christmas flick from the '80s. This is certainly not an easy concoction to mix, but writer/director Michael Dougherty comes the closest to achieving exactly what the flawless Gremlins did for this twistedly fun sub-genre. His decision to implement the use of real-life monster puppets instead of going full CGI certainly has a lot to do with this. But it was his clever decision to keep them hidden from the cast until filming that truly made them come alive. As stated by Park and Recreation's Adam Scott, the first time they'd see most of the creatures was on-camera, so their reactions ended up being completely genuine. Not that this film's wonderfully dysfunctional family, which also includes Anchorman's David Koechner, The Sixth Sense's Toni Collette and Two and a Half Men's Conchata Ferrel, needed it, but it certainly doesn't hurt.Krampus might be one of the world's darkest Christmas movies, but it manages to hold just enough light-hearted qualities with its family values to maintain some holiday spirit. I have no doubt that some audiences will find its premise a little unsettling, but its spiritual sensibilities and strange sense of humor prevent it from being a pointless tale of bloodshed. Thankfully avoiding typical horror clichés, this is one unexpected gift for the holidays that's sure to slay.",Krampus
187,thestarkfist,Silent Night Deadly Night,7,26 December 2016,"Synopsis: A severely dysfunctional family learns the true meaning of Christmas when the Krampus and his dark horde of malevolent toys and treats turn their holiday into a holocaust of horror.As it turns out Krampus is a figure out of Germanic folklore that was said to travel with St. Nick to dole out the punishment to the children who had not been good during the year. In the legend he uses a switch on the kids, however. In the movie Krampus lays waste to entire villages by committing mass murder upon those who do not have the Christmas spirit. Seems a little over the top, if you ask me. And over the top is exactly what this is. The ultimate Christmas story; Dickens's Christmas Carol, can be said to contain an element of horror in the guise of Jacob Marley, Scrooge's deceased partner, who visits him on Christmas Eve bound in the ""chains he forged in life"" and wailing in bitter agony over the terrible fate that his callousness and greed has delivered him into. Ghostly visitations aren't enough for this flick. When Krampus first appears he cuts the power to the town, plunging it into darkness. He causes a terrible blizzard to engulf it, cutting them off from the outside world and making escape impossible. Most of the townsfolk disappear, leaving behind only the signs of violent struggles. Soon the family is being picked off one by one, only to have their body turn up outside the house encased in a snowman. One child is devoured by a particularly disturbing looking toy in the attic. You might not want to let your 7 year old view this if they are particularly impressionable due to the violence against children. The movie is competently made. The performances are all good. There is humor and pathos mixed in to cut the tension. I was disappointed with the ending. You might find this enjoyable if not twisted holiday fare if you choose to watch it. Ultimately this movie subverts itself with its opening sequence which features a scene torn from every Black Friday news story of late. Shoppers are shown being trampled, punched in the face and tazered by security guards. Toys and clothing are ripped apart by frantic shoppers struggling to wrest it from the hands of another person. Who needs a Krampus to make Christmas a horror when we are perfectly capable of doing it ourselves?",Krampus
188,Harbinger_3781,Think I found my Christmas Blackwing,10,4 March 2016,"Aww yeah. I think I got a new hero for Christmas.This is incredibly satisfying. Sometimes, some people need their rude awakening to see what's wrong in front of them. From what I learned, Krampus is like the Anti-Santa Claus, like Satan the Anti-God. First I heard of this guy was in NBC's series, Grimm, and I distinctively remember Nick Burkhardt turning zombie and knocked him out cold in one punch, just WHAM! But instead of the good characters, I find the ""bad"" ones more fascinating. Instead of sitting on the sidelines observing humanity tearing each other apart, Satan put himself on the front line to force them to see their mistake, it's like a father grabbing the hair of his extremely naughty son and pressing him against the door glass of his messy room and say, ""Take a look! Look at the mess you done!"" Well, Krampus is like Satan: Christmas version. I guess he was dispatched only when the Christmas Spirit hits a critical mass beyond below a certain level; public knowledge: Good children receive gifts(some poor children may receive coal for emergency warmth) and bad children gets nothing, but having Krampus dispatched... whoa, that's gotta be one heck of a negative spirit.Krampus was a bit chilly, but I really like his method of actions. Sometimes, punishments are really more effective than reprimands. For the family in the movie, they really need this. They won't and never will see what really matters, or ever synchronize well, until they really lose it. Krampus demonstrated a really fine shock-and-awe, teaching everyone the consequences and price to witness when Christmas spirit hits a certain low level, and I found my new Christmas hero - an unconventional Angel Blackwing.Well, that being said, surely wish Hallmark will never have to dispatch him for the holidays - That'd probably be REAL scary.",Krampus

I know this movie is comedy- horror, but that is not an excuse for not make a serious film. They had a chance to make a great film, one of the best Christmas themed, but they didn't.... I was disappointed. The only reason i give it a 6/10 it's because i really enjoyed it from the start till the half of it, from moment to moment it's funny, then it's scary, then you don't know what is going on-a bit of mystery, as I said this could be a great movie.",Krampus

I was really disappointed. Tonight I thought ""Perhaps I was in a bad mood."" And decided that I would give it another chance. The actors did a decent job with what little they were given, but I'm pretty sure that none of them were proud of the end result.

191,CinderFall,I'm Dreaming of a Krampus Christmas!,9,10 December 2015,"...okay maybe not. But the points I do want to get across start with the opening credits. Oh hey! It actually does have opening credits! This is part of the more comedic section of the movie as it opens with a ""average"" Christmas shopping day as people trample, fight, and hurt others just to get presents. This all happens in slow motion while ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" plays. Michael Doughtery, you have outdone yourself! So, we get the main characters at the end of the credits as we see a slow motion of our lead, Max, in a fight during a Christmas play. This is a genius idea to open a movie! It only gets better. From there we meet Omi, the German grandmother; the cousins and the entire other family, Dorothy, and Rosie the bulldog. Everything is like a normal Christmas get-together; some bickering at the table, someone complaining about the food not being good, and the cousins being complete jerks to Max. Normal stuff. Then things turn serious after Stevie (one of the cousins) reads Max's letter to Santa at the dinner table. This infuriates Max to the point where he shouts he hates all of them and he hates Christmas. He runs upstairs and then rips up the letter after his Dad talks to him. He throws it out the window where its whisked up into the air. Unbeknownst to the family, a snowstorm is settling in. This storm wipes out the power of all around them, and that's the least of their problems! I don't want to get into spoilers or talk about the ending because everyone will have a different view on how it ends. It's a loose ending and its used to a good advantage to make the audience wonder what happened. It's not near masterpiece, but its really good for a new Christmas horror movie. One of the last ones we got was Silent Night, Deadly Night; and well, that sucked. If I were to break down the film and feature my favorite part, it would have to be when Beth is running from a tall dark figure with horns while it chases her from rooftop to rooftop. This is amazing because it shows that Krampus isn't some evil thing that only came to kill them, but a thing that is having fun tormenting them. He is obviously having fun, especially during that and the laugh scene. The costumes are well done, the creature effects are MAINLY practical, the script is not dry, and it's an all around a fun film. I give it an A- on an F scale. If you want to see Doughtery's other works that is highly praised, check out his other holiday (not Christmas) work Trick 'r Treat.",Krampus

You know, Chevy Chase and that corny comedy. So imagine them in a B-rate cheese horror flick. If that's your cup of tea, then you MIGHT like Krampus (it's still bad though). Apparently a lot of people do, because I see a good rating and many good reviews for this film. It's hard for me to believe that these reviews are real. Very hard.It's not scary. It's not mysterious. It's not spooky. It's not interesting. It's strictly 100% corn-ball comedy mixed-in with the B-movie type of over-the-top horror/comedy. So bad it's good (for those who like such a thing).Me....I thought it stunk. The comedy was excruciatingly bad. And the horror....for me to find it funny, you have to go all-out....like Re-Animator or something. Just having a couple wacky scenes is not enough. Especially when it's not clever and I've seen it a hundred times. Plus it got really boring for a while toward the end. Lots of LOUD yelling and screaming; annoying.Bottom line: If you're looking for a real horror movie, pass on this one. If you want a corn-ball horror flick....it's still bad.",Krampus

For those unaware, in ancient lore(not this film) Krampus is the stick to Santa's carrot. When Krampus comes to town, he rewards the bad children with severe spankings, and the exceptionally naughty children with a trip to his home for dinner(his dinner that is. )A mix of comedy and horror, Krampus is a wickedly fun twist on the traditional holiday dysfunctional family film. The horror is usually more comedic then horrific and the movie focuses more on the family drama and terror of what might/has come, than constant attacks. This is not to say it does not have chills, simply that when we do get them, the horror is more keenly felt because we have come to know these people, and the atmosphere is never excessively oppressive(it is Christmas after all. )The film starts with the well to do liberal Engel family preparing to host poor conservative aunt Linda and uncle Howard, along with their four spawn. Drunkard aunt Dorothy tags along uninvited, and things start to look decidedly UNmerry for Christmas this year. When young Max tears up his letter to Santa, he inadvertently summons Krampus and his helpers. He brings with him a snow storm first to isolate them, then absconds with the naughty family one by one. The Engels must learn the true meaning of family and togetherness if they want to survive this year.With its emphasis of family, compassion, tolerance, understanding, and love, Krampus is decidedly a Christmas film, and may even leave you feeling a little nice after having seen it(along with being creeped out.) Scary, but never TOO dark, and very funny, I can safely say I have found a new Christmas movie to watch at this time every year. If you enjoy dark humor, scares, and are looking for a little Christmas cheer(??) then check it out.",Krampus

The set design and environment is also creepy .At the start there is a sarcastic song playing in the background which shows the reality of Christmas now these days.Overall i would say it is a good horror movie and u can give it a watch.",Krampus
195,evan-pahl,A Christmas horror movie for the modern day,10,25 December 2020,"I think this is a highly underrated modern horro/Christmas movie. It doesn't necessarily fit all the cliché tropes because it is a creature feature with the holiday emphasis, and for the effort of the production and quality, it sets itself apart in a way that puts it on your list of annual must-watch Christmas movies, especially if you're a horror fan.
Director Michael Daughtry said in the special features and directors commentary that he was heavily influenced by classic 70s and 80s horror movies and their production, and tried to use practical effects and props when possible, as well as adding humor to the script. I feel that adds some quality to the movie magic and makes it that much more of an entertaining film to watch. Pair that with the message it gets across about the spirit of the season and it really packs a punch for your Christmas party.",Krampus
196,Samirsbureau,"FUN, yes perfectly described.",7,27 February 2016,"Let me start by telling you that i watched this movie with negative thoughts because a friend told me he didn't like it.And now that i watched it, I have no idea why he said so. In the beginning,the movie makes you think its your typical Christmas comedy family movie, but then after you get a few laughs, things take dark turns, and from there, it keeps on getting more intense and exciting.What To Expect: A simple plot. Laughs. Thrills. Edge of your seat moments.What Not To Expect: Your typical horror movie with demons and a straightforward film.This movie is just good at grabbing your attention. I personally thought, it's one of the best mix between horror and comedy.You'll Laugh.. But at the same time you're scared. It's an experience that you have to go through by yourself to understand. and the ending of this film is a bit open, and it leaves you thinking, and you decide to believe what you want to.I don't want to spoil anything more than that, but an advice, whether you're a horror fan or not, if you want to watch a movie just for fun and to kill some time, definitely checkout Krampus.",Krampus

198,d_stack04,A horror comedy that isn't scary...or funny,4,14 December 2015,"As a frequent cinema goer I can appreciate when a filmmaker tries something new. I like it when a movie takes a risk. But it is called a risk for a reason. Michael Dougherty took some risks with Krampus and while I admire the effort, I didn't care for the resulting product.Krampus is that movie that tries just a little too hard. Everything feels forced. The comedy. The ""scary"" moments. This movie desperately wants to be this generation's Gremlins and it isn't. Not by a long shot.This movie is not without its positives. The actors in this movie do a very good job and I was very close to caring about their characters' fates. But the good acting is wasted on the movie thanks to its clichéd dialogue. And the exception of this would be Conchatta Farrell. She plays the same loud, brash, sarcastic old broad that she annoyed us with for years on Two and a Half Men. I can't help but think that a better actress who could play the type of character they were aiming for, like a Kathy Bates, would have made the character more sympathetic and the movie a little better.The biggest problem with this movie is it doesn't ever really decide if it's a horror or a comedy. It gets more serious at the end as horror comedies naturally do but by that time you really don't care about these characters. It was a horror movie that didn't make you root for the bad guy per se, but man was I waiting for everyone to die. There are scenes where these people are getting attacked by their toys (yeah, I know. Stupid.) and you can't tell if you're supposed to laugh or be terrified. I laughed at how unterrifying the creatures were but I'm sure that wasn't the filmmaker's intent.And as for the creatures, once again I appreciate the deviation from the norm and using practical effects, but they are really cheesy and look too puppet-y. First off, we see some toys come to life and attack the family. Sounds like a real scary Christmas scenario. But the toys that come to life are a jack in the box; something that hasn't been under a Christmas tree in about 50 years, a porcelain doll that wouldn't be a suitable gift for ANY of the female characters, and an obviously CGI killer teddy bear. But my biggest complaint is the actual Krampus creature itself. The movie shows you flashes of the villain and even got me excited to see what this thing looks like. Then when they show the Krampus it looks like a prop from a local theater production. At that point, I wish they had never shown him, the mystery would have been way better.The movie's story is just flat out inconsistent. For a good while you forget about the Krampus completely because of the endless attacks from his minions. You never get any kind of explanation as to where everyone else in this town went to. The grandma character was most frustrating. They used the very annoying foreign language ploy to get more dialogue on the page. As in the character says something in a foreign language, another character asks what they said and yet ANOTHER character translates. See how I just wasted three sentences to explain something that could have been done with one? Yeah, THAT annoying. She also happens to be the living exposition machine. Why is this happening? Grandma will explain after the fact when saying this earlier might have saved a person's life but whatever, I guess. And at the end they kill off about 4 or 5 characters within a matter of seconds. It's as if they realized they had too many survivors at the end and just sloppily had the creature take them out.The most disappointing aspect of the film is its comedy, or lack thereof. I know how subjective comedy is but you see every joke coming from a mile away like you do this film's jump scares. Maybe it's the Conchatta Farrell thing bothering me still but the jokes feel like they were written by the staff of Two and a Half Men. It's just set up, break, punchline, repeat. They never take advantage of any physical comedy that could come out from a story like this.Overall, you could see that everyone really tried on this movie but the execution left so much to be desired. I wouldn't recommend seeing this in a theater simply from a financial standpoint. If you're still curious about this one by the time it gets to disc, go ahead and rent it if only to feed your curiosity. No offense but if you're a teenager you might really enjoy this one. I saw plenty of teens enjoying this one and laughing at the jokes I groaned over. So who knows? Maybe I'm just too old for this one.4 out of 10 stars",Krampus
199,alexrwatson-888-169026,Krampus: A Mixed Bag of Presents,6,1 January 2016,"With Christmas right around the corner, a demonic spirit named Krampus is accidentally summoned to unleash hell upon a disjointed family. Krampus is a horror/comedy directed by Michael Dougherty, who also co- wrote the film along with Todd Casey and Zach Shields. Krampus is a bizarre ride that includes a few laughs, and a few scares but lacks a tonal consistency necessary to feel like a cohesive final product.The story in Krampus is absolutely insane. Having a horror film set during Christmas is a welcomed curveball that makes the experience feel fresh. One aspect of the story I did not care for were the family members and their interactions. Sometimes their verbal exchanges made me laugh but other times made me wish that Krampus would go ahead and off them already. Most of the family lack redeemable qualities, and this made it hard for me to have an emotional connection in the story.Krampus does have some freaky imagery. The design of Krampus himself is not that scary, but some of his ""helpers"" are very unsettling to look at. In particular, the clown ""helper"" is absolutely terrifying. For some reason the writers felt the need to give the audience a detailed origin of Krampus, but it's silly and completely unnecessary.The place horror and comedy meet is where the film begins to falter. There is one great sequence in the attic that does a great job of combining laughs and scares, but outside of that, the movie feels like a tonal mess. In one scene, characters are completely serious while getting hunted by Krampus, and in the next, they are making jokes while their loved ones are dying. This felt as if writers were consistently clashing with their particular visions of the film and its tone.There are no bad performances, but the only relationship I truly cared about was the father/son relationship between Tom (played by Adam Scott) and Max (played by Emjay Anthony).Watching Krampus works best with a large group of people taking turns at guessing the next Christmas-themed death. I had a good time watching the movie, but the inconsistency in tone heavily detracted from my overall movie-going experience. However, this film does have a certain kind of charm, and I believe has the characteristics to become a cult classic within a niche group of movie lovers. Krampus is a mixed-bag of presents: sometimes you unwrap a PS4, but sometimes you unwrap a 6-pack of socks.Check out this review and many more over at www.watsonmoviereviews.com or feel free to follow me on twitter @alexwatson1994 to talk movies",Krampus
200,beccabentley,"Not comedy, not horror, just plain awful",2,29 March 2016,"I don't normally write reviews but felt compelled to because I couldn't get over all the positive reviews of this film. It starts off like a family film (home alone style) but then abruptly changes into unfunny, excruciatingly bad horror. I wouldn't mind but the acting is poor, the plot nonsensical and the characters so unappealing and idiotic that I really stopped caring what happened to them. Spoilers here..what mother would let her daughter go out in a horrendous blizzard and then not worry when she hasn't text to confirm her safety? And what father would hear what he thinks are his daughter's cries and then not investigate? In fact he just returns to the house and battens everything down (even though at this point no attack has been made on the house!) The film is full of these kind of inexplicable decisions. The back story is done in this weird animation and it makes no sense that krampus would descend on this family simply because a boy ripped up his letter to santa. I just couldn't buy into it at all. Krampus himself does nothing and just looks like some frozen puppet. I like comedy horror but this film is not scary and only funny in that it is laughably poor. It takes elements from other films and mashes them together as if this will somehow make a good movie. I've only given it 2 instead of 1 because i liked the montage at the beginning with the fighting Christmas shoppers. I wish I'd turned it off after this as the film just deteriorated from there.",Krampus

202,cgrill8,"A New Wonderful Kreepy Kristmas movie, welkome Krampus",9,16 December 2015,"Kouldn't help myself. Saw this on a Tuesday by myself at a local theater where the tickets are $5 on Tuesdays. Anyway, let start. I walk into the theater house with a drink and Goobers. It was pitch black in there. No one else was inside. The screen was not lit showing...anything. I sat pretty close to the screen in the darkness. Then after a few trailers, the movie started.I have to admit, this movie is mislabeled. It really isn't a horror movie exactly. It was great, spooky and dark. Being in the theater all alone, the surround was creeping me out. I kept thinking someone was over to my right when no body was there! Now the rest: The movie was wonderful. The message how Christmas is lost to commercialism, anger, and family strife really hit home in a new way. The family reminded me of my own getting together at my grandmothers house across town! Really! The actors were each wonderfully picked. Loved Emjay as Max. Howie Jr was perfect as the fat dumb thick headed kid. As he went for his 'treat'... I kept hearing Rupert from Harry Potter in my head saying ""How thick can ya get!?"" What this movie has that others miss out on is ambiance. The atmosphere, the darkness, the loneliness of being the one family around (possibily) on the street. The fear of losing someone, the fear of the impossible, and the fear of 'death'. OK, let me explain why this isn't horror. They way things happened, reminded me of the original Willy Wonka movie - you just don't see the kids come back. As a kid, the movie (Willy Wonka 1973) really freaked me out. Krampus just didn't, but don't stop watching it! And don't let them put the fire out! The personalities, from the actors to every THING else was spot on. Very little CGI here (there is and it's used quite well), which helped create a little more chaos.The music. There really wasn't much music. When it was there it filled in the incidental moments well. The regular Christmas music was used VERY well, which is part of the comedy itself! I failed to sit through the credits. I hear there are some cool tunes in the credits. The Krampus version of Carol of the Bells has many people's attention.The effects were mainly practical which made everything seem more realistic. From the parents funny comments when things were getting tough, to the things they were fighting! And boy they did give the good fight! The story holds its own, though simple. I wonder if Krampus was planning on hitting these people even before Max wrote his letter... or maybe that was just the icing on the cake. His letter is very key too. The emotional turmoil these people face really puts them all through a quick emotional blender for some really funny one liners. It almost seemed to me there were 3 different endings... I could be wrong. But this was a wonderful 'adventure nightmarish Christmas ride' I have ever seen. This movie will be my Christmas guilty-pleasure viewing each year once it's released on Blu Ray. Despite the events, I wished the language had been tone down somewhat. It was OK, but since it's not a 'real' horror movie, they could have pulled in a bigger audience. While some wish it had been R rated with more gore and language, I'm thinking just the opposite...but only wish the language was toned done a bit.The rub: Everyone continues to compare this to Gremlins! Really? In Gremlins, we see Gremlins killed, people killed, and havoc on an entire town in the old comic-style humor. We weren't really supposed to take Gremlins TOO seriously despite the gravity of it all. Krampus on the other IS supposed to be taken seriously, but with humor and heart. It is a Chrismtas spook-fest! It has it's funny moments, but the tone is more serious than Gremlins. And... well, I don't want to spoil the ending. With Krampus, they pull a many ideas from A Christmas Carol, the 'lessons being learned' etc... and they did that very well. I left the theater on a good-vibe emotional high I haven't felt from a movie in YEARS.The TRUE comparison. When you watch this, don't think Gremlins think, Willy Wonka, Private Eyes, And Then There Were None, Clue, Christmas Vacation and A Christmas Carol... all that brings us to Krampus. Not exactly the correct-looking Krampus, nor does he come down... on the correct date, but overall you won't care. The movie does it's job rather well. Every detail counts even the creepy 'parade' we see near the end! Maybe my family should integrate Krampus on December 5th... hmm... I should make myself a mask! Wha ha ha! And there are a lot of masks! READ THE TRADE PAPERBACK!",Krampus

Wish I could get my time back AND my money).IMDb is asking me to WRITE more in order to post this, unsure why, but it's painful enough to delineate my impression as is. There were audible groans through this entire movie from audience & think about this, avg age there was maybe 18 & they aren't too discerning when given ""horror films""...I think that says it ALL.

206,j-w-b-concepts,New Holiday Favorite,9,8 December 2015,"I guess I should start off by stating that I can see why Krampus may not appeal to everyone, but if you enjoyed Dougherty's Trick R Treat then you should love this movie. This holiday Horror/Comedy was almost perfect in my eyes and would have gotten a 10 if it wasn't so slow in parts throughout the middle, but still it had the perfect build up to an ending that could be interpreted multiple different ways. I don't want to give anything away so this review will just focus on a couple key aspects that really made this movie for me. For starters you don't get any of those cheesy jump scares, its all suspense that is built up from being stranded in a blizzard all the way to Krampus and his minions arrival. The horror is gradually introduced rather than saying bam! here's a Krampus kick in the face and we are going to jump scare you all the way to the end. We have a story here people and we are going to make sure you enjoy it by sprinkling in bits of horror and comedy. One of the main things that I really enjoyed is the minimal use of CGI. CGI has its place, and could have easily been used to portray Krampus, but Dougherty doesn't play that game. Instead we have old fashion movie magic with great makeup, masks, and costumes that show the dark side of Christmas. Yes we have CGI here and there, but in places that were obviously needed. Finally this movie has a Christmas message. Can you believe it? a horror movie that encapsulates you and leaves you with a message similar to that of what a Christmas Carol has done. Krampus is a beautiful piece of filmography, with a great story, and Characters you really get attached to as the movie goes on. A little more gore, some patch work to the minor holes in the middle of the movie and slap an R-rating on this and you would have yourself a 10. This will be a Holiday tradition for me once released on DVD as Trick R Treat is around Halloween. One can only hope too that when released they make a special edition that comes with Krampus's bell/ornament thing. I highly recommend this soon to be new Christmas tradition for anyone who really enjoys Mike Dougherty's work, even if you are a holiday scrooge.",Krampus

208,rkoch1,Blame the young for diminished ratings,10,13 August 2017,"I thought the movie was excellent (for sake of pure entertainment). The movie had excellent character design, and contained horror elements plus humor. Yes, there were stupid characters doing stupid things, but not as much as you see in other movies these days so what are you going to do. The movie deserves to be at least a 8 so I've bumped my score up to offset some of the younger audience, who was likely traumatized by this and came here to give the movie a 1. I read that many families took their young to see this movie (can't do anything to prevent the stupid these days) and because of that there were a bunch of kids who were traumatized and crying/shocked. I don't blame them! The character design was vivid and striking and surely would leave an impact for any young mind who envisions an endearing version of ""Santa"".So yea, the movie is about a 7.5 or so, the only thing I didn't like was how the antagonist ""Krampus"" was seemingly acting without real motive. What I mean by this, is his actions weren't to teach the ""kid a lesson"" about Christmas in a more violent way or anything, the demon was literally just there to kill and imprison everyone for no reason. I feel that this was perhaps one of the many alternate endings that the scriptwriting crew discussed while producing the movie, and they unfortunately went with this ending where I don't think it was the best. But everything else about the movie was great.",Krampus
209,furtherdownfilms,Krampus - A Movie Review by Nathan Fischer,6,17 December 2015,"Michael Dougherty's film Trick r' Treat has become a Halloween staple for myself and many others. Now, Dougherty is back to terrorize Christmas with his new film Krampus. Does he keep the same high quality horror as he did in Trick r' Treat? Yeah, sorta.Krampus is about a little boy named Max who is on the brink of not believing in Santa Claus anymore. After an argument with his snotty cousins, Max announces his hatred for his family, tears up his letter to Santa and throws it out the window in to the winter wind. Bad idea. This summons Krampus, an old Germain legend who is described as Santa's shadow. He comes (with his crew of evil minions) to terrorize and punish the naughty kids.The movie opens up with comedy and keeps that theme through out its entirety. This is some snappy writing here that keeps the laughs coming. This family will make your Christmas with your loved ones feel like a walk in the park. The movie also keeps a solid grip on the theme of Christmas. Its not just a setting, its essential for the movie to work. It does perhaps take a little too long for Krampus to finally show, but I was OK with it. The banter between the family was enough for me to stay entertained.There is an animated sequence while the grandmother tells a story about her first encounter with Krampus. This not only changes the pace of the movie, but its also my favorite part. The animation is charming while being very dark and eerie. I was very happy they included this scene. After that, the movie pretty much jumps in to full horror mode. There are some scary parts, but its mostly tame (retaining a PG-13 rating). The creature designs are fantastic, using mostly practical effects. Krampus himself is also well designed, almost resembling a Santa from your worst nightmares.I will say that some of the action was hard for me to decipher. With the power out and lots of snow flying around, it was hard to tell what was going on sometimes. I can also see how some audiences might feel robbed by the ending, but I personally thought it was fitting for the Christmas theme.So while the pacing is a little off, and some of the action can be chaotic, I enjoyed Krampus. It didn't totally fulfill my Christmas horror needs, but with some great comedy and awesome animation, this will be a movie I will revisit on the holidays.",Krampus
210,nathan-mcgee6,Great Christmas horror,9,11 March 2016,"I was finally able to watch Krampus the other day and I was sure glad I did. The overall story is nothing particularly scary or at least for adults and doesn't seem to take it's self to serious, but very entertaining, full of fun and likable characters that I actually cared about in the end. The back story of Krampus was very thought out and didn't feel stupid as I thought it was going to be when I first heard about it. it's kind of a home invasion/survival type situation like you're Next for example but with a nice twist. The casting was great, they weren't a bunch of useless young good looking people hired for their good looks and not their acting skills. They all played their parts very well, even the children. I usually hate CGI in my horror films because it makes everything look really fake and takes away the fun and the fear, but it was very well done here and even had a good mix of practical effects as well. Each of the monsters were very well designed and had their own goofy and monstrous look to them that kinda reminded me of demonic toys. Now if you didn't already know this PG13 horror film doesn't have a drop of blood in this at all kinda like Final Girls so gorehounds will be disappointed throughout. But for everyone else it's a fun lighthearted horror film that doesn't take it's self to serious and a little overall cheesy, but a lot of fun to watch and i recommend you check it out on DVD on the 26th of April if you didn't already see it in theaters or just wanna watch it again",Krampus
211,parrishcub,It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Krampus...,7,7 December 2015,"Upon first glance at the trailer several month ago, I was unsure what to make of ""Trick r' Treat"" director Michael Doherty's dark Christmas tale with the amusing title. It looked like a cross between horror, comedy, and fantasy. Surprisingly, they cut the trailer in a fitting fashion. The film was very much what the preview presented it to be. I was often reminded of Steve Miner's 1985 cult classic ""House"" (the one with William Katt), which a prominent critic aptly-described as ""an offbeat horror comedy"". Teetering the line between funny & scary is definitely a thin line, but to establish right out of the gate that the laughs would be obvious & applicable did help keep me entertained at least (although for some reason I was the only one chuckling out loud the majority of the runtime). In retrospect, Doherty's directorial triumph – or at least the film to put him on the map (Trick r' Treat) – had many of the same elements. 1. It was not particularly scary; 2. It had many good, dark comedy laughs; 3. The horror & comedy co-mingled in a unique yet, on occasion, rather silly fashion that instigated certain unintended snorts; 4. It drew from folklore; 5. It did have genuinely-creepy moments; 6. It had a mostly-ensemble cast; 7. It was made by enough of a horror aficionado to veer away from clichés & be made well; 8. By the end, I did not feel cheated by the experience. Toni Collette, who I have loved since her breakthrough performance in ""The Sixth Sense"" was honestly one of the main reasons I decided to give ""Krampus"" a chance. No shocker; she was great. Instinct told me she would not take a role that did not have some depth & intelligence, and even though this film takes a nosedive into the absurd, it was created with plenty of heart, soul, humor, & humanity. Adam Scott (Parks & Recreation) was a terrific dad despite some poor decision-making early in the feature. Alison Tolman (TV's Fargo) I failed to recognize until halfway through, and her take as wife of ignorant right-winged David Koechner & mother of several dysfunctional children fit to an eye-rolling template that is all-too-accurate but a funny shade of a family of Archie Bunkers. The opening credit sequence hit on all the holiday stupidity that retail surveillance alone could market as a billion hits reality show defining the fundamentally-insane lengths people go to get what they want. Truly, it was a fun start. Though a critic claimed it had a ""single-yet fatal flaw"", the PG-13 rating shadowed the unusual moments that inspired their comments for mebut I do understand their point. Despite a slow build-up to the title demon's reveal, the end product lacked in sufficient impact. The film's end does sound off like it's got a pair, and I salute it for that! Sadly, I doubt many people would agree.",Krampus
212,BloodGuts,'Krampus' is the Christmas gift you've been waiting for since Gremlins,9,29 December 2015,"The festive favourites of the horror genre haven't really changed since the introduction of 'Gremlins' and 'Silent Night' back in the 80's. Smaller films have gone under the radar including the sleeper hit 'Rare Exports', 'Santa's Slay' and 'Sint' but none have captured the big screen attention that is so deserved of the genre. 2015, by all extents, seems the year of Krampus, a mystical shadow of Santa who punishes the bad leaving Santa to dish out his presents to the good. The legend of Krampus has lived on throughout the lifetime of the jolly man himself yet it is only now we begin to share the legend from its humble roots, welcoming the hooved naysayer into our homes and festivities.'Krampus' lives up to its expectation of being an instant Christmas classic with the joy and goodwill of Christmas wrapped up in spine-tingling wrapping paper to unravel. Gone is the happy festive family and in its place a true representation of Christmas, the burden of the family reunion and stress that all seem to go unnoticed in the world of movies, until now.Adam Scott and Toni Collette envision the parents who try to do best and when her sister played by Allison Tolman, the entourage of husband David Koechner and siblings only provoke further drama in the Engel household. The only Christmas spirit the Engels will see this year is that in the liquor cabinet and when youngest son Max (Emjay Anthony) relinquishes all hope, the message is sent straight Santa's shadow who arrives just in time to make even the doubters believe that where there is good, there is evil too.Superbly paced in a tone that can only be compared to that of Gremlins, this is a humorous yet dark tale which has plenty of appeal for young and grown adults alike (just make sure the little ones are in tucked away first). Kudos has to go in the hands of casting director Cathy Sandrich, the films biggest credit has to go to the stars that play out this thrill ride in all of its glory.In addition, the creep fest that arrives in Krampus and his elves, is nothing short of disappointing. From torturous jaws like snow creatures to a jack in the box that certainly has bite, director Michael Dougherty has chosen to keep the majority of the magic to practical effects which the film incredibly benefits from. Add into this a punchy score by Douglas Pipes and you have all of the ingredients for a fine feast to sit back and indulge.'Krampus' is the Christmas gift you've been waiting for since Gremlins and sure as hell does not need you to act surprised.

213,istvandragos,More of a comedy than a horror,5,2 January 2016,"Krampus is the latest delivery from Michael Dougherty, the director of the much acclaimed horror movie, Trick'r Treat, so there were pretty high expectations laid upon the movie especially when it came to scares, but the movie does totally something else, it makes you laugh. The humor of the movie is really good, the jokes were pulled of really well,the characters were well rounded and each one of them has a few witty lines, the actors are well chosen for each role. Also the movie contains some well executed social commentary, especially in montage during the opening credits. Despite all this the movie can't strike a balance between humor and comedy, and when it forays itself into horror it really doesn't succeed. These parts are lacking any kind of thrills and the worst part is that you can't wait for the movie to get back to its humor driven moments. The monsters are looking awful, in the bad way, they aren't believable at all, especially those made with practical effects, it seemed like the costumes weren't finalized, like they were put on the actors on a hurry. The CGI counter parts fair a bit better, but they don't help with much. Another complaint would be the lightning, most of the events that were happening outside the house and especially during night, were indistinguishable, especially in the final act, where you didn't even bother to follow the events anymore. All in all, if we take in consideration the comedy part the movie was great, but when it comes to the horror part, it can't really keep up with the previous one. The movie simply can't find the balance that was attained in The Visit, and another thing where The Visit did a better job was the simplicity of set pieces, Krampus being over filled with a lot of items that are decreasing the visibility even more. The movie is advisable for those who prefer lighter horrors, but not when it comes to the lighting of the movie.",Krampus

217,Jgirl2688,Krampus is exactly what we need.,8,6 December 2015,"I first heard of the story of Krampus from a Christmas episode of American Dad!, and I've been surprised that none of the reviews I watched online for this film mentioned that since it's the one of the only times Krampus is mentioned in pop culture. Perhaps now that this movie is out, we will hear more about him. I sure hope so, because this is the perfect Christmas tale for the kids and families out there. It's a story that we could all benefit from, in fact.The film starts out by showing us the insanity that we all know as Christmas shopping. It's all about how materialism and family strife can wreak havoc on our emotions during holidays. The problems all trickle down to the children, who should really be enjoying and celebrating the season instead of getting caught up in the stress the adult deal with. So, our main character rips up his letter to Santa, and wishes for all of this to be over with. Krampus, being the evil side of Christmas, grants the wish. The characters are slowly plunged into a horror story. Their Christmas story becomes a story of survival. Will they be able to get along for the sake of surviving Christmas? There were only a few things that I really had a problem with. That's why it gets an 8 instead of a 9 or 10. The first reason comes from the fact that I am a serious horror fan, and felt disappointed at the lack of blood and gore in the film. That reason may keep some genre fans away, but also makes the film more accessible to the kid and family audience, whom the film is really for. The other problem I had with the film was with the editing during the scenes with Krampus' helpers, because it was quite jumpy and made it hard to see everything going on the entire time.Again, this is a good movie. I highly recommend it as one of the best new family Christmas movies. Krampus is exactly what we need to balance out the holiday. This will definitely be remembered as more than just another holiday themed horror movie. It will, hopefully, become a staple for Christmas viewing.",Krampus
218,AmbushBug26,"Krampus may stumble here and there, but tis a jolly little scare.",6,4 December 2015,"Krampus may not be the scariest film this year, but it's certainly entertaining and you can tell the creators gave it their all. Even if not everything in the film ends up working.The director is very talented at creating legitimate thrills and building up suspense. There are no false jump scares or lame fake-outs. When the film is building up to something, it builds and builds. Showing just the right amount at just the right time. That scene in the trailer where the girl is being chase under the car, is exactly how a chase should be done. It's tense, it's fast paced, and it's awesome.This may be the first film in years that captures the feeling of being stuck at home in a snow storm, perfectly. I actually remember shivering at one point and wondering if the theatre had turned on the AC, but it was actually just that the film looked cold. The fireplace always looked cozy and warm and inviting, and the claustrophobia of staring outside and seeing a blank white page of environment really sits in. It feels exactly like you're there, stuck in that house.There are so many moments, that are insanely creative. The opening credits sets the mood perfectly and there's a pretty cool animated stop-motion segment in the middle of the film that evokes those old Rankin/Bass holiday specials. These are great ways to bring a little more life to the film and shake things up a little.There's a lot of creativity in the monsters. From demonic sharp toothed teddy-bears, a jack-in-the-box caterpillar monster, and maniacal laughing mischievous gingerbread men. Krampus looks great as well. He kinda looks like Santa Claus on Meth, which is a unique design. Although he does have one main flaw, his face is just so lifeless and cheap looking. The Krampus in the animated segment showed more personality in a matter of seconds, than the actual live action costume.The actors for the most part are good. Conchata Ferrell gets all the best lines. But the other actors all do good work with what they're given. I thought I was going to hate these characters, but strangely enough the performances of the actors involved actually made me end up rooting for them to survive. They tried their hardest to work with the limited material, and it shows.The ending was the worst part. It ends three times. The first I was perfectly fine with, and felt like a legitimate place to end the story. History repeats itself, lessons are learned. But then it just kept going, and the second ending was kinda lame but at least was serviceable. We got to see more of Krampus' crew which was kinda cool. The third ending was just flat out dumb. I get what the creators were trying to do. The old divine intervention ploy we've seen in The Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life, but unlike those films it just felt like a cop-out and unearned.It's not drop dead funny, it's not soil your pants scary. It's just kinda in the middle. There's some good stuff, there's some bad stuff. But in the end, I was entertained by the film. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to see it on the big screen, but watching it at home by the fireplace with a cup of hot-chocolate, totally!",Krampus
219,logansgotmail,Horrifying,7,1 December 2018,"I can't really tell you why, I don't know what it is, but this is for some reason one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. The whole thing is dark and unsettling. The visuals are eerie, it feels hopeless, and the twist at the end is wild.",Krampus
220,Tecnicinismo,A scary and goofy ride that couldn't get any better,7,15 August 2018,"I am a fan of Norse mythology and when I came across the Krampus and it's tradition the Krampusnatch. I must say that I find the concept of an anti-Santa Claus is beyond creative and attractive.Needless to say I wasn't expecting much when I heard that hollywood was making a movie about such a rich legend, I was expecting an average teen horror relying on jumpscares. but then I saw the director Mr. Michael Dougharty and my expectations where hyped. I really loved Trick'r Treat and it's tongue in cheek horror, and let me tell you that's exactly what this legend needeed.
First let's talk about just how beautiful the monsters of this movie are, yes, because the Krampus is just the icing on the cake for all the horror this movie has stored for us. There is a really clever use of puppetry and customes in this movie in a level that honestly caught me off guard. There's only one monster in particular that you'd notice is CGI, but then I'd ask you... how else would've you made it? all this is paired with really creepy imagery that manages to mantain an atmosphere that reminded me of the best parts of The Shining.On the other hand, this movie dares to bring us a serious scolding about the true meaning of christmas, and when I'm saying this, I'm not talking about family or love, I'm talking about greed, hypocrisy, material obssesion, looks and all that makes Christmas a really bad time for some people, if you're willing to take this message as it comes, you'll be satisfied, safe to say this is not a ""feel-good movie"".Watch it on Christmas, hug your family, lock the doors, because Krampus is coming.",Krampus
221,flamingblok11,Welcome Krampus,7,5 December 2015,"Bust out the eggnog and gingerbread cookies (perhaps seasoned with some festive herbal greenery). Krampus has come to town!Max (Emjay Anthony) loves Christmas. Despite looking ten, he still believes in Santa Claus, and wants nothing more than a peaceful holiday filled with love and kindness. Unfortunately, his boorish aunt and uncle (Allison Tolman and David Koechner) and their diabolical children are coming over to spoil the season. What's worse, they brought obnoxious Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell) along. When dinner goes wrong, Max wishes his family would go away, and accidentally summons St. Nick's shadowy twin Krampus, who causes yuletide chaos for all.If you've seen any advertising for Krampus, you've probably been lied to. It's being billed as a Christmas-themed horror flick, and if that's what you're expecting, you'll be disappointed. Go in expecting a semi-nonsensical, yet mindlessly entertaining cinematic concoction of comedy and thrills, and you'll have a good time.Objectively, the film isn't a masterpiece. The script isn't particularly taut. Some of the jokes aren't funny. A few of the scares aren't spooky. The child actors aren't great to watch, and there's one flashback sequence that is, curiously, animated. It is, admittedly, visually jarring, and definitely a questionable directorial decision.Despite all that, I (and the three people I saw this with) had a pretty good time. The adult cast doesn't phone the movie in, and they're all fairly charismatic. Fans of Parks and Recreation will get a kick out of seeing Adam Scott play the bumbling beta, and the above mentioned Koechner plays a convincingly churlish redneck. Take it from someone who spent last year in rural Virginia; I'm familiar with the type. There are enough successful gags and absurdities to earn the comedy label, and some of the monsters are interestingly designed and markedly disquieting. They do a good job of holding back Krampus, making his reveal pretty mesmerizing (a feat many monster movies struggle with). He, too, is well designed, and stands out from the crowded list of modern horror creations. At least aesthetically.While I won't spoil it here, I feel I have an obligation to talk about the film's ending. It appears as tough the credits will roll about four times, and it's a bit of a roller-coaster. The endings go from interesting, to great, to frustratingly sophomoric, to frustratingly twee, to satisfying. Just hang in there until the final cut to black before passing judgement.Of all the Christmas movies out right now, this is definitely the symbolic star atop the tree. If you're looking for a subversively merry movie, but have already seen The Nightmare Before Christmas thrice too often this year, grab some friends and check out Krampus. There are definitely worse ways to spend six bucks.",Krampus
222,nohemig_karla,I'm pretty sure someone paid people to give this thing good reviews,1,28 February 2017,"In my opinion, this is one of those movies that deserve a zero. I'm really puzzled by all those high ratings and the awards this movie got. For starters, there is not one single likable character in this movie. They are all either evil for no reason, disgustingly rude, or just plain out of touch... the decisions they make don't really make sense (if you watch it you'll know what I mean). I watched it because I had read some reviews that compared it to some horror classics from the 80's. But I mean, Gremlins had a plot, and some humor that actually worked. This movie tries to be funny and dark and just ends up with bad graphics of stuffed animals that... kill people? I don't know, sometimes movies are ""so bad they're good"" but this one just got stuck at bad. If you can, please watch something else.",Krampus
223,AstridKent,The next horror cult classic,8,1 December 2015,"Honestly Universal should be paying me for the amount of hype i've created for this film among my friends and their friends. I was without a doubt super excited for Krampus for two reasons. Firstly it's a horror film that isn't from Blumhouse, honestly with every horror film these days being ""from the producers of Paranormal activity, Insidious and The Purge"" I was starting to think Jason Blum made a pact with the devil to produce all mainstream horror films. Secondly this was the kind of film I hadn't seen in ages, something along the lines of Gremlins but more horror focused was what I've been wanting for a long time. So after seeing Krampus I was not disappointed at all. Was it a horror masterpiece on par with The Exorcist? No it wasn't but thats not at all what I wanted. I wanted a fun imaginative horror film and one that finally does justice to the long overlooked legend of Krampus. The idea of a Christmas horror film is nothing new but all the well known ones (Black Christmas, Silent Night Deadly Night) are always slasher films with human villains when Christmas had it's own traditional villain with Krampus why has it taken so long to bring him to the big screen?But anyway Krampus is unlike any film i've really seen before it's both lighthearted and funny but also surprisingly horrifying. I mean it when I say there's some nightmare fuel in this film even if i didn't find it that scary It is still in my opinion a legitimate horror. The Visit proved to me that horror and comedy can mix well. When a horror film is 100% serious thats OK as long as it's warranted. When a horror film takes itself too seriously though it can make it a boring watch. A great comparison is A Nightmare On Elm Street from 1984 and it's remake in 2010 the remake was largely panned because it was too serious while dealing with some ridiculous subject matter whereas the original made it into some morbid humour which worked much better. Krampus does the same although it is obviously more of a comedy than Elm Street. Krampus himself looks fantastic being made entirely of practical effects and carries a great presence in may opinion he is a classic horror villain in the making. Of course he isn't alone and is accompanied by demonic toys and wicked elves who's sadistic and playful nature makes for some truly horrifying visuals. Oddly enough though this is still a Christmas movie and does manage to bring me those warm holiday feelings. I think this film in it's own right will hold a special place in my heart as a holiday movie with a wickedly twisted side that I just loved so much. In conclusion Krampus won't win Oscars but I think if you go in wanting to have fun and experience some scares along the way you'll be more than satisfied. Krampus is one hell of a Christmas gift.",Krampus
224,soggydeadgirl,"Best Christmas Move, Ever!",9,27 February 2016,"I must say that I waited for Krampus release with 'bated breath. There was so much chatter on several of the horror site, the build up was great. My anticipation for a great horror movie was high. Could Krampus live up to my expectations? I hoped so.I went on opening day to a nearly empty theatre, some action adventure was probably drawing people away. (Turns out that I live in a town that just doesn't seem to appreciate horror.Sitting there in the dark theatre, my anticipation rising. The movies opens and it starts off looking like a family movie. As it progresses I realize I am not viewing a horror movie. I start to sink into some degree of disappointment, when it hit me: Krampus is a Christmas movie with some horror elements. A Christmas movie in the vein of A Christmas Carol and It's a Wonderful Life. It is essentially the same story as its predecessors, but more fitting to its time. I thought the movie well done, even if I might've done some things slightly differently.I foresee Krampus becoming a regular, well loved Christmas favourite.

Krampus comes for badly behaved children but Max was not a bad kid. He got into a fight in the opening sequence that was later explained as a bully bothering him. Idk about you but a 10 yr old scrapping once doesn't warrant his entire family and him basically going to hell for eternity. The ending was trite, unnecessary and the movie itself is just a stream of disconnected tropes. The family dynamic wasn't enough to make their fate seem deserved. Krampus takes evil wicked immoral children. Max throughout the entire film acted like a typical normal child for his age. Why was Krampus even there let alone set upon punishing what the film showed was a normal kid is beyond me, because he ripped a letter and tree it out his window! The parents in this were more problematic and not even Max's parents came off that terrible. The aunt and uncle were decidedly heinous but again this had no bearing on the outcome. The finale seemed like a rushed stretch and the movie left you feeling like wtf did I just watch and I can't get my 1.5 hours of my life back.

The 1 person he has is his grandmother. When he wishes it all away to get back the life he had of joy and happiness, Krampus comes with his band of Christmas-themes demons to torment them all.In an age of sap, this tosses in some Halloween and some laughs while entertaining you in the process.

228,erikghost,Krampus Review: Beware of Santa's Dark Shadow,7,29 December 2015,"Review by Golden State Haunts and EventsKrampus starts off with a stereotypical scene of a mob rushing into a big box store on what appears to be a big sale only to be seen tearing items away from each other and fighting over the merchandise while Bing Crosby's ""It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" is heard over the speakers. Meanwhile, preteen Max (Emjay Anthony) is engaged in a fight during a passion play because he's upset that a bully is telling the first grade kids that Santa isn't real.Max's gun and football loving uncle Howard (David Koechner) and aunt Linda (Allison Tolman) come to Max's father, Tom (Adam Scott) and mother Sarah's (Toni Collete) house for the holiday with their chubby children (Maverick Flack, Queenie Samuel and Lolo Owen) and old alcoholic Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). The children steal a letter that Max has written to Santa Claus and ridicule him. Max, who just wants things to be the way they used to be between his parents and who hasn't exactly been a good child the past year in a moment of being upset goes to his bedroom, rips up the letter and throws it out the window.All of sudden there's a blizzard and all the lights in the neighborhood go out. The set dressing with a palette of whites and grays will really chill you even in a warm theater. Max's sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) leaves the house to check on her boyfriend. After not arriving back home when she was expected a concerned Tom and Howard go looking for her. Howard is attacked by something that crawls under the snow.When they get back to the house, Beth still missing, Max's wise old grandmother Omi (Krista Stadler) who speaks in German tells everyone about a mythical creature who is the shadow of Santa Claus who come when children are naughty and/or have lost the meaning of Christmas. The childhood story of her being visited by Krampus is a nice interlude done in animation.Director Michael Dougherty (Trick 'R Treat) seems to have taken some inspiration from both Gremlins and Poltergeist. Once again, like Sam from Trick 'R Treat, Dougherty has created an almost likable protagonist. Soon Krampus's minions invade the home and attack. True horror fans might not find the film that scary, but scenes of gingerbread men attacking with a nail gun and a giant, child-eating Jack in the Box are definitely entertaining. Eventually the family is even attacked by proverbial evil elves.Krampus is not seen much in the movie until the end, but when he is he moves either under the snow or by jumping around rooftops. The film relies more on puppetry and costumes rather than CGI.A Pagan-like sacrifice leaves it up to Max to regain the spirit of Christmas to save his family. The ending is sentimental and may remind you of other Christmas favorites such as ""Home Alone"". There's different interpretations of how the movie ends, but we don't want to give any spoilers. We were thoroughly entertained by the movie and would definitely recommend it.",Krampus

No really, the film barely earns a 3/10 in my opinion. Literally the only saving graces are the art direction, the practical effects and the fact that it's a compact (by today's standards) 90 something minutes. The plot is weak and contrived, the characters are trite stereotypes, the dialogue is unremarkable at best and cringe worthy at a few instances, and the acting is sub par for the most part. I appreciate they tried to do something unexpected in with the ending, but really all the twists in the span of 5 minutes were just excessive and forced.

The German grandma was very sweet, in my opinion.I most liked this film for the storybook/dramatic quality. Toni Collette built her character as Sarah very well. I liked when she was ready to face the monster cuz she's such an interesting character, in my opinion. It brought out her true side. She's a very caring mother and as a person very stern. When it was time for the adults to face the monsters, she looked like she knew what she was doing. She seemed fierce, sure, and even emotional in that way.

(suspence build up pretty well, i liked seeing the ""Monster"" which I usually dislike in other Horror Movies) -Krampus is pretty accurate. (And Scary) -Additions to the old myth are either working well or are too funny to not include. -Brings the world closer to the real old Christmas we ""enjoy"" in central Europe. -Funny half of the movie working well. -Scary half works perfectly fine. -Overall pretty good contrast to the rest of the commercial holiday.The Bad: -Maybe a little slow on the start. -Maybe overall a bit too harsh for some viewers. (but no blood or overuse of the F Word, but still pretty scary but the closer the end the more serious it gets with less comedy)The cinema was pretty much enjoying it some people hated it i guess. But i felt it was quite good and had a good evening.I would say overall if i wanted to watch Krampus in the very beginning, which i didn't intend to, i would be happy with the actual Movie.It Keeps its Promises and does very well what it intends to do.

It starts off well, seems promising as we have the Santa believing boy confronted by his obnoxious cousins and equally distasteful uncles and aunt ; in fact the only person who he seems to have an affinity for is his German speaking grandmother. Unfortunately the relatives obnoxiousness sort of melts away, the hard and tough gun slinging Uncle is soon saved by the boys apparently wimpy father, and the Grandmother explains the reason behind their predicament suddenly speaking fluent English !

I love the theme, I love the set up, the family feels real, and there is fun and interesting villain. But they committed the cardinal sin of horror movie making; they overused CGI. After the first scare or two with CGI, I thought, okay they can't keep doing this the whole time right? Horror is all about suspension of disbelief. Well it's pretty much impossible to believe anything in this movie is actually happening, or could happen, because every time a monster\creature comes on screen it looks a video game character blue screened into the shot. It was flat out obnoxious. And then when you finally get to see Krampus, which isn't until the climax, he has the worst CGI face I have ever seen. It was so bad that I didn't even realize until a month or two later that he was supposedly wearing a mask, which frankly is just as bad. like I said, this movie could have been wonderful, it was entertaining to point, but when the cinematography looks like 2015 and the CGI looks like 1991, the movie feels completely disjointed. And if you think that CGI can only go so far, just look back to what they did with the first Jurassic park, back in the early to mid 90's. If they can pull off dinosaurs 20 years ago, then can we please make a monster look even somewhat realistic; or better yet, just get rid of CGI and go back to practical effects. John Carpenters remake of the Thing had amazing effects that looked real and scary, and that was what 1981?

240,Finn_Rllm,"Not as good as i expected, but still entertaining.",6,1 December 2015,"*Maybe small Spoilers, but nothing about the plot* When I heard about the film Krampus, I was delighted.The ingredients sounds like an exciting mix. A Christmas setting with a fresh and unspent ""villain"". A solid cast with Conchata Ferrell (Two and a Half Men) Adam Scott (Mitty) and Toni Collette (Six Senth) and lots of black humor wrapped in a horror movie. Unfortunately, I went with mixed feelings from the cinema and reading my vote you can already see, that the film could not fulfill my expectations completely. Krampus thrives on the unusual idea with the eponymous character, ""Krampus"", but unfortunately the film did not make it in the first 60 minutes to walk properly. Here one has unfortunately taken too much time to introduce the characters, although they still come along relatively stereotypical and a long introduction would not necessary. Really good is the atmosphere of Krampus, everything looks pretty dark and menacing. The horror scenes are exciting and by the unusual idea is to surprise the one time or another. Very good is the implementation of the various figures to Krampus. Here was very little on CGI, as set much more on traditional animation techniques. This gives the film a great look reminiscent of the films of the 80s, where technology like dolls and co was still normal. A single exception is the gingerbread men which are completely CGI and, unfortunately, less convinced of their quality. Here you realize the relatively small budget of 15 million dollars. Unfortunately, there are also bad points. There's the matter of the genre mix. Here, unfortunately, was too isolated between funny and creepy. So the funny passages easy to act compulsively and can not be so well connected to the atmosphere, as is the case for example in a ""Zombieland"" or ""Shaun of the Dead"". Here, the film simply takes too seriously when it does not have to be, although there really Conchata Ferrell is noteworthy that knows how to repeatedly convince with their funny kind. The plot just as the plot twist was good for a horror movie in my opinion, but just at the beginning of the story, as already mentioned above, their lengths. Despite exciting idea simply is not as round. The last point of that bothered me, was the appearance of Krampus. Here is just shown at the beginning of his appearance he is an agile contemporary, but it occurs in favor of his helpers a little too much in the background. So I have to end up giving only 6/10 points although I felt entertained by the movie. For horror movie fans this is strip a very fresh way of entertainment. For everyone else an entertaining movie with weaknesses.",Krampus

Even if you allow for the fantasy genre of this film, this film still has not worked well. The fundamental plot is OK - and I try my best not to give away too much - this film is a kind of US modern version of Scrooge (Michael Caine) - but the little sequences here and there that pepper throughout the film are frustrating. One example - how can a grown man be intimidated or even harmed by a small soft toy the size of your hand that climbs on your back when it does not even carry a weapon? And this grown man rolls around the floor and appears to be unable to stand up and get rid the nuisance. Now you know what I am pointing at - the film is peppered with 'nonsense' (even though as I said I am putting my 'fantasy' cap on while commenting). I have seen many fantasy films.

244,leeprew1,Horror comedy?,4,8 December 2016,"I can count the number of successful horror comedies on one hand. This is most definitely not one of them. After viewing the trailer I had reasonably high hopes for this film. The cast seemed competent and well put together and the look and tone really appealed to me. Unfortunately, it suffers from the same issues that many horror comedies do in that it doesn't really know what it wants to be more and in doing so it is neither a good horror or comedy. The horror elements certainly outweigh the comedy (in speaking with a friend who also saw the film I had to point out that it was supposed to be a comedy and the cast had several comedian actors and he was still adamant it was just a horror) and I would have preferred it to have been a straight up horror. I really don't see how anybody can describe this as a throw-back to 80's movies as it's very much a lazy and uninspired modern piece of film. The only reason I will remember it is because it was such a wasted opportunity and that is very much indicative of our current times.",Krampus

247,costas26,"Atmospheric, Seasonal and Comedically Sinister",7,30 April 2016,"This is undoubtedly another holiday horror gem from Michael Dougherty following the success of his Halloween-themed 'Trick R' Treat'. The film masters the 'Gremlins' formula and updates it to fit the 'Trick R' Treat' atmosphere as brought to life by Dougherty. The score is very effective and works well within the film which mixes comedy, horror and holiday family drama. The Krampus story has never been done this way before, certainly not with these production values and the talent behind this movie is very well chosen out. Allison Tolman, Toni Collette, Adam Scott and Emjay Anthony are the stand-outs in the movie.The special and visual effects team did a great job in bringing this vision of Krampus to life with a very memorable titular creature and with minions which are reminiscent of the 'Gremlin' days.The story of Krampus is intriguing and very well told in its debut portrayal of such scale and the film leaves many stones unturned which gives ideal room for a sequel.

You've got to take it for what it is - it's a campy horror-comedy with a really solid cast and some pretty fun scares, nothing more and nothing less. This is what I would consider to be a ""family-friendly"" horror movie, almost like this year's Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.

Luckily, Krampus (with tongue planted firmly in cheek) pulls it off. From the slow-mo opening of the horrors of holiday shopping to the twist at the end. The play on Christmas traditional expectations are on full display. What Daugherty did for Halloween he has now done for Christmas, and gives us a movie that, like its near cousin, descends into the wilderness of visual and dark comedic excess in order to deliver its players to a moral that, somehow, manages to be universal and thoughtful. The methods at which he goes to make the point will be at odds with what you anticipate when going to a movie about the good old holidays, but that's precisely what makes it so distinctive.Many will perhaps find the tone unsettling and imbalanced for the nature of this premise, but ""Krampus"" is much smarter than it lets on

252,Drebe73,Devilishly good companion piece to Trick r Treat.,9,6 December 2015,"I have to say that being a big fan of Michael Dougherty's Trick r Treat, it's no surprise that I absolutely loved Krampus. I left the theater and my heart was still racing from the scary fun that I had just witnessed on screen. I have to say that every actor played their role quite well. I enjoyed all of the characters and they all were developed enough that you cared about each of them despite their dysfunction. The film was shot beautiful and the setting really portrayed the chilling, uneasy and helpless feeling that the characters were experiencing. As for the creatures, they were all absolutely terrifying. I was afraid I'd have nightmares about that gruesome Jack In The Box. Though their were plenty of scary moments, the writers didn't go for gore or gratuitous jump scares to frighten the audience. What makes a truly scary movie is when the director gives the audience just enough visuals and audio to allow the them to fill in the blanks as to the character's fate. My only gripe I would say was how the characters seemed to just give up on each person who went missing from the family. I would have thought they would have been more distraught afterward. Otherwise this was exactly the type of film I would have expected as a follow up to Trick r Treat yet gave me plenty to love on its own merit.",Krampus

254,benmckenna-1,FILLED WITH Christmas AVERAGNESS,5,7 December 2015,"let me start by saying even though this isn't an awful movie, I was severely disappointed. from the trailer, cast, reviews and overall feel of this crimbo flick I was highly anticipating it.I was expecting a hearty Christmas horror with laughs, gore and frights which were there but not in the best way.the comedy while laughable in places felt done before as were the characters as a whole even though they were well played (some). it couldn't decide in places if it was going for humour or scares which somehow worked more than when they directly went for one or the other.the gore is where I felt let down. not that I wanted bucket loads or anything but there isn't a single death scene. its a stable of horrors but no everyone is either dragged off or taken out off screen. I was disappointed as they could have had some really inventive deaths but instead took a random approach of never showing anything.the frights are the reason this film got a five for me. whilst not being overly scary there were a few scenes that screamed either awesomeness or perfect dread. the best scene is the reveal of krampus as he chases someone on the rooftops bounding to each house. the creatures as well were clever and cool but there potential wasn't fulfilled as they never showed them doing anything overly monstery.overall this is a kids film. a couple of bad words, some dread and a bloody leg stop this from being a new generations gremlins or monster squad. if they had intended for it to be a scary kids film I would have been fine, but as they marketed it as a full blown horror I'm afraid I won't be using it as a stocking filler.",Krampus

256,jinky-blahblah,I can't say Krampus is the worst movie ever,3,5 December 2015,"Only because I haven't seen every movie. (But it's waaaay up there, or down there, depending on how you look at it.) I suspect that the filmmakers are either 1) in hiding out of shame, or 2) in hiding and howling with laughter at people, like me, who were curious and needy enough to spend scarce money on it. I only gave it a 3 because of the scenes with the Evil Clowns and Gingerbread people.Some observations I made during the movie: Riddled with clichés, including shallow characters portrayed by mediocre actors, predictable vulgarity and bottom-of-the-barrel attempts at lame humor.Weak, nebbish of a father and a dimwit, borderline personality mother; kids whose language and behavior would have them sent to reform school, or at least thrashed soundly; and, of course, horrible family coming to visit.Fashionable Democrat vs evil Republican jokes; Stinky, crying baby; Slobbering English bulldog; Obligatory scene with Grandma crossing herself; Imminently forgettable lines like, ""Look, what's that?, and, ""They took him!""; ""Who took him?"" and others along the lines of ""Hey, look, a thing."" During scenes that were supposed to be funny, no one - as in not a single person - laughed. And when the supposedly scary stuff began, no one jumped, gasped or indicated fright or shock in any form. There was no reason to as there had been no foreshadowing of any kind.Oh yeah, weak continuity. It's like they took deleted pages from unmade iterations of Chucky 17, National Lampoon Christmas Vacation, Poltergeist-the unreleased, film-school version and Blair Witch Project, tossed them in a basket and handed them over to the editor, who has my sympathy.This film could become the next Plan 9 From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, only it isn't good enough.I wonder how long it will take someone to score, ""Krumpas, the Musical""?Final thought: Peeee Yew! Thank you, drive around.",Krampus
257,jutterio,"Probably interesting if you are American , but other than that ?",6,13 December 2015,"I can see why people like this film , and i see what the artist tried to do here. But a big sell of this film would be that the Krampus is a creature from the 'old world' that the Americans don't know anymore. Part of the scary would be that you could fear a return of such a creature you don't know anything about anymore that is apparently still feared in the old world etc. All Americans can relate to this. The thing is : I know Krampus, firstly he is practically only a thing in Austria, Secondly i know that there he doesn't come with Christmas but around December 6th and lastly : I don't know anything about American Christmas other than what i learned about various kids movies that focused on rescuing it.A few years back, We had a similar movie to this called 'Sint' in my country which featured a horror version of our Saint Nicholas tradition. That film implied that through commercialization etc the people have forgotten that Saint Nicholas and his helpers actually should be feared. Only That is relatable to me ! I can for the time that is suspend my disbelief adopt this notion and have it frighten me on top of all the usual horror stuff, have it turn something i associate worm feelings with into a nightmare.But I don't feel I know the characters in this film. Although they are supposed to have Austrian heritage and the mother of the paterfamilias is played rather well by Austrian actress Krista Stadler, and i can somewhat relate to that because i am half German myself; I can't fully project myself onto them because the things they do that are supposed to make me connect to them often times are foreign to me (The mixing of Christmas and early December traditions does not help). So what am i left with ? A visually interesting film about A American Family with a link to Austria getting haunted by a folkloric character from Austria together with what i assume are all American Christmas clichés coming alive , I felt the snowman showing up at the beginning was pretty promising . But most of the time I felt more like a voyeur then a participant. Its also part comedy and they do play around with clichés from both horror and Christmas movies. But those are not nearly as fun if you are not from the states where apparently the Christmas hype starts very early and people are already done with Christmas before it begins.",Krampus

They tried to throw in the theme that if you don't believe in Christmas this will happen to you. Where they trying to preach at America for not believing in Christmas anymore?

259,TheCinematicMind,'Twas the night Krampus entered my life and surprised me tonight!,8,6 December 2015,"The Cinematic Mind reviews Krampus (Dougherty, USA, 2015) ****/*****A few days before Christmas, we meet a dysfunctional family who are not getting on very well. A young boy (Emjay Anthony) loses the hope and spirit of Christmas because the holidays aren't the same as they used to be with his family and proceeds to destroys a letter he wrote to Santa Claus triggering the release of a massive blizzard and the summoning of the titular Christmas folklore demon who strikes against the family and it isn't alone.From 2007's Trick 'r Treat director and screenwriter Michael Dougherty, this is the second holiday themed horror film he has done. This sub- genre is known as the X-MAS Horror! For me, they are very mixed-bag for me! My favourite would easily be Black Christmas (1974) in my life as one of cinema's most underrated slashers of the 1970's with one of the most bone chilling endings in a horror film and Gremlins, enough said. Others include The Nightmare Before Christmas, Christmas Evil and Silent Night Deadly Night (I consider it a little overrated). The potential is huge but also can be a task to handle. However, this is movie besides Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale are the greatest modern X-MAS horror films of recent times considering I was making fun of the title alone and thought it would be TV movie quality. The results altered once the film began.The setup is a brilliant throwback to the stereotypical mean-spirited family from Christmas Vacation and Home Alone and a great satire on consumerism taking over the holidays with a riot at a Shopping Mall with ""It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas"" by Bing Crosby in the background. Ahh! The lost of being vintage and nostalgic. I call glorious irony.The acting is surprisingly strong. Adam Scott as the classic overworking father, Toni Collette as the anguish wife and David Koechner as the overbearing mean spirited uncle who provide great conflict in a dysfunctional nightmare at each other. Even the child performances not once cringe me at all! Once the characters start to realise what the following events are taking place and coming to learn lessons about the actual meaning of Christmas, I quote I dropped in awe. A celebration gift to all the memorable horror films and Christmas horror films of the 80's/90's.From Gremlins, The Evil Dead to Poltergeist, Nightmare Before Christmas and one of my favourite scenes, a homage to Rankin/Bass with a back-story of Krampus presented in animation. The comedy is hilariously quotable. Mainly from the cynical drunk great aunt played by Conchata Ferrell. However, it never ruins the thrills of the suspense and creativity of the creatures the film thrown at us. For my universal acclaim, the production design, the music score by composer Douglas Pipes and the practical effects of Krampus and the minions brings to life the dark corners of Christmas in a way I wanted to experience. From the vintage jingles to the chilling suspense pieces. This is an example of me wanting to check out the art of Krampus and resulting in myself in collapsing all over the designs. They took the budget of $15 million and the crew carry out this stimulating picture given on what they had on their shoulders.However, why do I did prefer Trick 'r Treat still more? Simple! The execution wasn't fully there. Krampus felt underused at times! When Krampus is in it, my mind is blown away in excitement, I wanted to discover the hellish nightmare of Krampus. There might had been a little too much of the minion/toys more than Krampus. There needed to be more set pieces with the character without this disjointed middle. Also, the ending nearly irritated me as it nearly involved one of my most hated cliques in horror history until the rest of the ending happened, it at least never destroyed the ending with the message of the film and what it turns out to be. I wanted a little more than that because I felt it could had a longer runtime. It breathe a sequel that could happen.Still, I'll consider this during a time where most expensive Horror films are underwhelming unintentional comedies with ugly third rate CGI, Dougherty and his crew decided to continue the practical dream to us Horror fans and brought us a dark and fun early Christmas gift! In conclusion, 'Twas the night Krampus entered my life and surprised me tonight! Merry Christmas and let's hope the force would awake and rise. Tell me what you think of my review.",Krampus

261,deebrubaker,Merry Christmas From Hell,9,12 December 2015,"This movie obviously was intriguing from the moment we all viewed the trailer. A Christmas horror/comedy with a solid cast, this movie had potential disaster written all over it. Christmas and horror have tried to combine their holiday spirits multiple times in the past 30 years with movies like Black Christmas, Jack Frost, and Santa Slay only to come up slightly short. Krampus is the answer to our holiday prayers.From the moment the movie starts, it's hilarious. Excellent cinematography and it only gets better. With classic Christmas movies and music on in the background for a majority of it, it somehow gives you this quaint nostalgic feeling. The constant bickering from two very different families reminds me of Christmas's back home and the relentless arguments at the table about the most pointless nonsense really brought the true spirit of a family Christmas to life.Once Krampus shows up on screen the movie really kicks it into high gear. The special effects are solid and the helpers in the movie are truly ghoulish and yet comedic. I found myself laughing and feeling unsettled during some of the scenes with Krampus's toy minions. I felt like I was watching Sam Raimi's Evil Dead Christmas Special and I loved every second of it.As far as bad things about the movie goes, I would say that sometimes the movie would slow down for no real reason or the conversations back and forth did not make much sense and seemed there just to fill in the gaps, but that 's not really much to complain about. All in all this is an excellent movie for the holiday season and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good comedy and/or horror.",Krampus
262,joelacunaisawesome,Really solid look at a horror Christmas story,8,14 December 2015,I had decent expectations from the man behind Trick r' Treat but this movie blew those expectations away. It was a solid horror from the half Santa half Goat looking Krampus to the creepy look of his little helper toys that go in and take families away. The atmosphere was really well done to feel like awful things are going to happen to this family. I really enjoyed how they put effort into the creepy special effects and make up that was done for all the creatures. The showing of how awful the family is to each other was done great too considering i really wanted to go in there and just slap the crap out of the awful children and the shitty parents. Over all this is a really good movie. Not a very many jump scares at all but the over all creepy feeling really makes up for it and i loved it. I think there needs to be more movies like this and less movies like the Paranormal series sort of movies.,Krampus
263,yarbroughstarla-40175,Be careful what you wish for,9,18 October 2018,"I was enormously entertained. Sometimes funny, dark and spooky without outright fear, but with a definite level of uneasiness. You think it will turn out alright and everyone will be safe because you don't actually see any corpses. You watch it and liken it to other Christmas movies where the protagonist learns a lesson and earns happiness. If you expect that here then you missed the point, he come stop punish. When Krampus was called, their fate was set. This is not a feel-good family holiday movie where everything comes out hunky dory. This movie should have done much better but it was up against the two biggest movies of the year, Star wars and Mockingly 2, so it didn't have a chance. For those who did see it, I hope they enjoyed the reality (vs false happiness) of other holiday tales, and enjoyed the ""it doesn't turn out alright"" ending.",Krampus
264,seanb333,"If you miss it in theaters, rent it!",8,21 December 2015,"Very enjoyable and delivers on what it promised - a funny horror movie. Not surprising given the great comedic cast. The opening scenes are hilarious.To me some of the scary scenes were a bit too slow to be really scary. But this works, as it is really about watching people get scared & react, rather than getting scared and reacting yourself. Also it was not too cutesy nor clichéd, sticking to being a horror movie first.You could put this in a category with the old Gremlins series. I warn against younger kids seeing this (or Gremlins), especially if they still believe in Santa.All in all this movie is a great bit of fun. A good break for those overloaded with Holiday Sweetness, but still feeling the Holiday spirit.***All Spoilers from here on*** The good: I enjoyed how the settings could go from a ""Home Alone"" to an ""Aliens"" flavor. I really like how the ending wrapped up. All characters learned lessons, not just our main protagonist. I preferred this to Gremlins. Both movies deal with the loss of belief in Santa. Gremlins does it in a very negative, off- hand way - it didn't serve that story and should have been left out. In Krampus the topic is central to the story concept, and yet it is positively handled (as only a horror movie can) because by Krampus being very real, Santa must be too, right? Doubt at your own peril ;).The bad: Not a big deal; there's a political moment where our stereotyped ""meathead relatives"" self identify as Republicans by saying ""they must be Democrats"" about our protagonist family. Obviously scripted by a left winger writer who couldn't resist. But it's just once and it does work with the character. It's tolerable as even the right- wingers are really good guys and not so horrible. Surprising! Perhaps the Christmas spirit touched the leftist writers too?",Krampus
265,devonsterling10,Krampus Review,6,20 August 2016,"A very fun and enjoyable second act and half of the third act and had really good effects and really suspenseful and awesome kills that left me satisfied and some good character development. But unfortunately was kinda ruined by the ending and first act. I didn't like the first act and I hated the ending. Most of the characters mainly the in laws are EXTREMELY unlikable. I know they're supposed to be but I just hated those characters and I couldn't wait for Krampus and his helpers to kill them and when some of them did die I was happy. The ending also got me very angry even more than the first act: but warning spoilers! It was all a dream...it was all the kid's dream...that is my most hated film cliché and it annoys me when it is just a dream but then shocker! it's not. But I thought with the exception of the first act and the ending...it was enjoyable. If it had a better ending and first act and at least made the in laws a little more likable it would've been great. But for what's it worth, it's fine. Would I watch it over Christmas again? probably. But it wasn't the great Christmas horror movie about the legend of Krampus that I expected. I would still still recommend it though but just remember those little flaws.",Krampus
266,jjburchard,A Pleasant Surprise,8,7 December 2015,"When I first heard about it, I was excited about Krampus for two reasons:1) The concept (gotta love German folklore)2) The man at the helm (Michael Dougherty knows what he's doing)Then I heard it was going to be PG-13 and suddenly my expectations hit the floor. Not that violence and language are necessary for a good horror movie, but I kind of took it as a sign that the film would mostly pander to the teen audience and aim to make its money back because teenagers notoriously see bad horror movies.But I was wrong, and I was pleasantly surprised about it. Krampus is, in many ways, not unlike cult hit ""The Babadook."" Both films use practical effects brilliantly (only 1 of the ""monsters"" in Krampus is CGI, and it's used mostly in a humorous way; without any spoilers, I'll say it reminded me a bit of an important character in Shrek). Both films tie their overall aesthetic to an important motif — The Babadook with confronting grief and Krampus with appreciation and conviction in humanity as it applies to the microcosm of family.Krampus features a great performance (grandma Omi), several good performances, and no bad ones. The characters are fairly archetypal but they all serve the story quite well and pack plenty of humor (that, as others have mentioned, crows increasingly dark). There are plenty moments of genuine humor, but not in a way that distracts from the terror available for a PG-13 movie (again, I'm not saying it would've been served any more by more gore). The movie is also pretty genuinely beautiful, from its slow-motion opening that is not subtle about the movie's take on commercialism and the irony of the holiday season, to the blizzard- engulfed neighborhood the whole movie takes place in. The pre-horror set design is not an after-thought, as it often can be in scary movies. And I will also say I was pretty satisfied by the ending. It's one of those movies you appreciate even more as you think about it after seeing it. If you're at all enticed by the concept of the Krampus or holiday horror, you'll enjoy the movie. It's entertaining from start to finish, both for its humor and its scares.",Krampus
267,Octavien,Great Horror Film with Some Christmas Comedy,8,4 December 2015,Going into this movie I expected it to be a horror comedy with more comedy than horror. I was wrong.Like many horror films this film starts out light and then becomes continually darker. The start is a great parody of modern day Christmas and rather funny. The movie gets darker fast and the middle produces a great mixture of light comedy and dark horror. The last third is surprisingly dark. The end you'll either hate or love. Horror fans will be glad they have a movie to watch every holiday season. Those seeking more comedy will be disappointed but not by much. The cast is excellent and the performances by Scott and Koechner stand out. Ferrell and Tolman provide great side characters. The rest of the cast provide good performances with none making me wish there was another in their place. Characters are well written and the development is one of the best in a horror film. Characters are supposed to mimic family and much like many Christmas stories the family is more likable as it progresses. The plot is decent. A warning to commercialism like most Christmas movies and specials these days except much darker. The horror in the film plays like a home invasion. There are pure comedic moments that don't ruin the tone of the movie. There are pure horror moments that sets the tone. There are only a few horror/comedy mix moments allowing a dark tone for the movie without being too outlandish.The only problems I had was with the lack of subtitles and need for Max/Tom to translate for the German grandma and the ending will give you mixed feelings.

First reaction was its not good for kids because maybe it was like other movies that ruin Christmas hope. But it turns out this was the kind of good Christmas message of hope I wanted in this kind of movie.Cannot give it more than 8, would say 7.5 because the cast, the visiting family is so disgusting you cant wait for the movie to end so you don't have to suffer them. And should take off 2 stars because of the BLAST!!! and BLAST!!! and BLAST!!! that was so loud it would shatter a wine glass easily if I had been holding one in the theater. I had to sit with ears covered, pressing hard. The ear damage part is not good for kidsThis is a movie about suspense and kids will jump and scream and then likely laugh. no way you want the spoiler, its something you want to discover in the movie. This movie its more important i think than most in that respect.Good for the family, they will likely be OK watching it a 2nd time.",Krampus
269,afutoma,Amazing Message and Amazing Costuming/Makeup,9,14 December 2015,"Warning this does contain some spoilers!!! The movie is like a Christmas tradition gone horribly and accurately awry. With amazing acting, costumes, and makeup Krampus will scare you out of your bones.The movie also carries some underlying and very important messages such as to be careful of what you wish for and to always be thankful to have a family. The plot line can seem a little dry and sometimes it seems the characters are not as fully developed as you might like, however, what the family battles to protect is much more important.This movie highlights the true spirit of Christmas and what can happen if we lose ourselves to hatred and petty marketing ploys.Omni's part was also well-played and very mysterious. Both she and the youngest male child are the focal points of the movie. The German was also spot-on so good one there. The story of Krampus may or may not be completely accurate but this movie is still a Christmas-must-see. This is also not on the path of a traditional horror movie so do not expect traditional horror movie anything here.",Krampus
270,This_Really_Sucks,This should have been called KRAPPUS,1,6 December 2015,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS RIGHT FROM THE START!!!Setting up a ""horror"" movie with a marketing campaign that screams ""HORROR MOVIE!"", but then presenting us with a family friendly horror movie in which the hero is a tween and everyone lives in the end is just an extremely crappy thing to do!!! Of course, I should have seen this coming from the guy who turned Superman into a sickeningly lovesick, Lois Lane-stalking, peeping Tom with his ""Superman Returns"" story. You know, the Man of Steel story that made ""Superman 4: The Quest for Peace"" look like ""Gone with the Wind""!NEWS FLASH, Mr. Dougherty - Horror films and family films DON'T MIX WELL! Decide which one you're gonna make and stick with it.If you're going to make a movie in which the titular character is historically known to be evil and merciless, then you should make the frigging movie reflect what he is! Who frigging makes a PG-13 horror film to begin with? This is like promising the public a ""Halloween"" movie, but, your movie is about Michael Meyers prowling the neighborhood tickling his victims instead of dismembering them!This wussy version of Krampus makes The Grinch look like Satan himself.However, the director did do a decent job setting the tone for a dark horror film once Krampus arrives... but, then the movie pukes all over the audience with no on screen violence or bloodshed and then a gang of evil elves which is pretty much just a bunch of short actors in what looks like unpainted Mardi Gras masks or something. To top it off, Krampus, himself, never does any of the killing or physical violence – he just looks like a fat, dirty, homeless, passive, evil leader. The evil-doings are all handled through his evil minions: a Jack-in-the- Box, a toy robot, a rabid teddy bear and a gang of gingerbread men. Seriously?This movie starts with shoppers comically fighting for Black Friday deals. And as the audience around me began to roar with laughter, this was the point where I should have walked out, but they got my frigging $10 so I figured I'd stay put and see if it got any better. NOPE, it didn't!This entire movie is filled with senseless behavior, from utterly retarded characters, that really only serves as weak plot devices to get us from one scene to the next. Such as...We are presented with some of the most irresponsible parents in movie history. Here's an example A frigging mysterious blizzard of historically epic proportions has appeared suddenly and from nowhere (complete with strange snowmen cropping up in the front yard), and this mother and father allow their young, teenage daughter to head out into the blizzard from hell so she can walk several blocks away to her stupid boyfriend's house all because she's worried that he hasn't responded to her texts? But, wait, it gets dumber when she hasn't returned after a couple of hours, the mother gets concerned, but dad blows it off and says she's fine, she's at her boyfriend's house. Does the writer even have kids? If so, would he send them out into a blizzard like the one he created in his story? If not, then why put it in the script just to separate the daughter from her family so Krampus can make his first appearance to the audience?It would have been more forgivable to have the daughter ask permission to leave, have the parents say ""Absolutely not"", and then have her sneak out of her bedroom window only to have mom and dad discover her missing later. It's much easier to accept a rebellious child's behavior in your script than a couple of retard parents who are so stupid as to send one of their children into the freezing unknown to check on her little, pizza-faced boyfriend. And then, there's the scene where one of the parents is helping two of the kids escape into a truck, but, instead of climbing in with them, she actually closes the door and tells her son she loves him right before she's dragged away by a monster as her son watches in horror.AND THEN as the parents try to fight off the onslaught of evil toys and dumb crap with a couple of guns, we're subjected to the idiotically clichéd ""taking-your-time-to-pull-the-trigger-so-you- can-make-a-stupid-wisecrack-but-something-else-happens-while- you-were-wasting-your-time-talking-and-you-miss-your-shot"" plot device. This happens several times and is really annoying! It doesn't build tension  it's really a sign of extremely weak writing. In fact, everything about this movie is a product of weak storytelling skills. How do you people even get these things financed?Then when we finally see Krampus up close, it is some of the worse creature makeup I have ever seen on a big budgeted, highly anticipated ""horror"" flick. The creature's mouth never closes, like a Halloween mask - you couldn't even spring for some better effects? AND THEN in the end, when all of the family members have been taken by Krampus, the only survivor – the whiny, tween boy who summoned Krampus - confronts the holiday demon and the demon actually has mercy upon him and his family. And they all live – but trapped in a snow-globe? Total crap!As a fan of horror – and an author of it, as well - I am thoroughly disappointed.",Krampus

I'm no expert critic and this is actually my first review, but I can say that this is an enjoyable movie and well worth the watch time. This is by far the best Krampus movie that i've seen and it is silly in a good way. It's definitely not a disgrace like some may say.I'm not a harsh critic. I enjoy most movies and I usually find it difficult to find bad things in a movie, but I instead review movies on wether or not I regret watching it.",Krampus
272,able-70721,Rewatched and still enjoyed,8,23 December 2018,"I watched this movie in December 2015 - when first released. I wasn't in the right frame of mind, or watching it properly, so I rewatched it in December 2018 with fresh eyes. A lot of what I thought that first time rang true again!Still... a movie that makes you want to see it again has to mean something...The negatives of consumer culture at Christmas are shown from the get-go via the opening credits, and this sets the tone for the remainder of the movie.Great effort is made to establish the characters, but in hindsight, they aren't particularly likeable. Which I suppose makes the reason for Krampus' visit even more necessary.The problem with spending so much developing the characters/situation (ok... we get the idea... extended family at Christmas can be a burden... NEXT!), we aren't really giving an onslaught of terror/horror until the one hour mark which feels somewhat delayed.The CGI gingerbread men take away from the creepiness and 'what isn't seen is scarier' vibe earlier. In face, speaking of earlier... the scene in which Beth's father and Howard search for the daughter conveys the vibe of what the horror SHOULD have remained - a silouetted Krampus on chimneys of neighbourhood houses... hoof prints... The moment we ""see the monster"", all anticipated shocks are erased and we aren't left with any mystery.I believe KRAMPUS never screened in Australia - or if it did, screenings were limited. It even had a trailer release in mid 2015 but nothing was ever heard again. The reason would be the ending, I suppose. The blatant 'f*&k you' to the holiday season and any grinches out there... but the snow globe finale poses a poignant question... what happens is we DO stop believing in the spirit of Christmas?",Krampus

I can't even bother to write why this is bad.It reminded me a lot of ""Ed Wood"" , not the great movie but the stupid movies ""Ed Wood"" was making in that film.anyway, If you hear my voice : Do not bother watching this, its one of the movies that I think not one single person can give it a 10, yeah that's it.I now go wash my eyes to remove the ugliness of the last two hours they witnessed.",Krampus
274,reinisl,A decent comedy horror film,5,17 December 2015,"I had this film on my mind for quite a while and after having seen ""The Night Before"" which in my opinion was a flop and a boring comedy I was really afraid that I'd get disappointed twice in one week. It wasn't the case as it really exceeded my expectations.This is as decent or as ""normal"" as a film could possibly get. You'll get some good jokes, some good horror parts, the music is well placed and the story develops nicely and on a good pace.For me, it's really important for the comedy part to click together with the horror parts and the director has really done well on this, as sometimes I had my heart racing and suddenly a good well-placed joke had me laughing before something scary happened again.As for the level of scariness, I think it wasn't like the complete horror films, it's rather mild and an average viewer could watch it too.A good film to watch if there's nothing else left to see.",Krampus
275,adelau95,Perfect Christmas Horror,8,26 December 2017,"The usual Christmas movie will do its utmost best to make Christmas out as this time of magic, family unity and general good cheer. This movie does the exact opposite and does it well enough that I hope an Easter movie is on the director's schedule for future viewing. Future planning aside,The movie tells the story of a suburban family gathered together for Christmas celebration. There is a tiny problem though - these people do not like each other. At all. All this stepping on toes results in desperate measures taken by the family's son, Max, and the rest os history - a bloody one at that.If you are looking for a genuinely good horror Christmas movie, this here is it. You won't regret giving it a chance.",Krampus
276,Marshymint98,"Bizarre, and not really in a positive way...",5,6 December 2015,"I wanted to like this movie. The concept appealed to me, and the concept of an 'evil' Father Christmas as the basis seemed intriguing. I mean, isn't the idea of Father Christmas slightly sinister? However, the movie was ultimately bizarre, with the horror aspect not remotely terrifying, and the film somewhat resembling a spoof movie by the end.The movie opened weirdly, with a collage of what appeared to be Black Friday fight clips. I have no idea how this related to the movie to be honest. More than anything it established the strange sequences coming up. However, once the actual story started there was some appeal. The joining of unwilling family members at Christmas, while cliché was actually quite entertaining, reflecting what I'm sure many families have experienced at some point. It was also awkwardly funny on occasions, and ensured an appealing first act. The dilemma of a snow storm also was exciting, with the idea of a family isolated creating a good horror basis. However, the second the horror came into the movie the suspense was lost. For me, horror has to be somewhat realistic to create fear in me. The first scary scene involved a creature jumping from roof to roof on a street. Not really realistic......In all honesty the movie lost its appeal from there. Children started to go missing or were killed and their parents completely got over it in a matter of seconds. The actual scary creatures turned out to be little ginger bread men, or goats with weird capabilities. I actually zoned out the horror sequences were so dull and ineffective. Essentially, the whole movie went outrageously over the top, with absolutely no structure or sense to it. It was like the writers had made up the story as they went along. The movie also seemed to rely too much on comedy, that seemed uncalled for, and not remotely appropriate. This mixed with the pathetic horror certainly made a laughable movie, that as I said seemed very much like a spoof. The ending as well was obnoxious. Myself and the others with me questioned whether this was 'all a dream.' Well guess what? It was - but in keeping with the typical horror trend, the closing scene questioned it. The movie couldn't even create a new structure, it merely followed the overused horror structure. You can imagine the effect. The acting was decent enough with the grandmother standing out, with an actual mystery surrounding her effectively. Other than this the acting was average: yet the cheesy script could be the cause for this. Overall this movie was hugely flawed, with virtually no effective horror, or plot. Yet I guess this movie had a decent concept - that should hopefully create more similar but superior Christmas horrors. This one though would have worked far better without the horror. In fact the opening created a real strong comedy vibe - that would've suited the movie far more.",Krampus

279,lawnnomechick,"BAD. Bad writing, acting, CGI, editing, and ending",1,12 November 2016,"The writing was awful. The writers don't seem to have a grasp on how conversations work, how children speak, or how a person in any specific profession would speak. It only took me the first few lines to realize this. At that point, I almost gave up on the whole movie but kept watching, hoping it would improve. The writers continued to disappoint throughout the film. Example: Why would a child psychiatrist say she was with the police? It makes no sense for the character to introduce herself as anything other than what she was. The acting was not good. The actors'deliveries of lines were unconvincing and interaction between characters was inorganic. Costume and makeup were also a problem. The psychiatrist had WAY too much makeup that made her look like a hooker rather than a professional. Every time she got out of bed, I swear she was wearing a different outfit than the one she was wearing when she got INTO bed. The costumes of the police officers looked like they came from a Halloween store. Continuing the topic of aesthetics, the CGI of Krampus was unimpressive, lacking color, and not even close to realistic. It looks like it was created by an unpaid college intern. While I'm on the topic of tech, I should also mention that the film editing was awkward. Some of the transitions between scenes were strange, and short, unnecessary scenes were kept in that didn't help move the plot. The story line was interesting but the end was disappointing, confusing, and left a lot of questions unanswered for seemingly no reason. This could have been a great movie if anyone involved had any talent, whatsoever. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Krampus

But I've been to like 30 - 40 previews before and I've always been the guy who found something good in every single movie (and there were quite bad ones among there), but Krampus is just so totally meaningless and boring it's astonishing. Well, I even found one good thing: I like the costumes, Krampus looks great and I also like the other creatures. Not to mention I really like the idea - so even two good things - retelling of an old myth is a cool thing and in one point I've to agree with the other reviewer: it focuses on the ""real old Christmas we ""enjoy"" in central Europe"". That's fine.But that's it. I'll write a short list of cons:The film starts really, really slow, this may be okay, but the start last for about 60 minutes... Just nothing happens, nothing bad, nothing funny, nothing ... It's just insignificant. The characters are not really relatable, they are such stereotypes and even though the film takes so much time for the introduction, it's not well used.There are some scenes that are supposed to be creepy, and they are not per se bad, but those scenes really get the red carpet rolled out for them. You know minutes beforehand that ""something"" is gonna happen. To be honest, I laughed a couple of times, and most of the times the scene was at least a bit funny, but in the context of the film it was always a pitying laughing. While I laughed I was feeling sorry for the film because it really had potential. But most of all - I can only repeat myself - it's just utterly insignificant. Not even really boring, or outstandingly bad, the movie made me apathetic. Honestly the most ""Yeah, whatever!"" film I ever watched, I could not even get upset.",Krampus

297,CriesofCredo,Christmas horror movies typically don't work but Krampus...,6,6 December 2015,"Alright, so I went into this movie with kind of high set expectations and walking out I was disappointed with Krampus. For the most part, Christmas horror movies just don't work well and Krampus is a huge step up but it still doesn't feel quite right, however it is significantly better than most other horror Christmas movies (black Christmas, jack frost). When I'm done seeing a movie I ask myself two questions, was I entertained throughout the movie and would I see this movie again? Unfortunately, I wasn't all that entertained throughout and I really wouldn't want to sit through it again. Here are the things I thought this movie did right and wrong.Right: The actors were great, there were genuinely funny and creepy scenes, character development was fantastic (the aunt cracked me up), the story line actually was decent (I loved when the Grandma told the story of Krampus, I thought that worked really well), and the best thing about the movie was the Krampus. The Krampus looked fantastic and was very interesting to see every time on the screen. The scene where Krampus is jumping from roof to roof chasing the sister was so sick and done really well but unfortunately this is the only time we get to see a scene like that. The other monsters were also well done, the big clown thing was cool-looking and the use of the snowmen was creepy as all hell. So yeah, Krampus did have some good things going for it but the few issues it had are BIG issues.Wrong: The main issue with Krampus is the pacing. The movie's timing is very wacky, the beginning is super slow and then when the climax hits it seems like everything is thrown at you all at once. In the first hour, maybe two people are killed off then like five main characters are killed within thirty seconds of each other, its to the point where their deaths had no significance. Also, I feel like they went overboard with the Krampus minions. The gingerbread men were the only thing in the movie that looked incredibly CGI and should have been left out because nothing else was so obviously CGI! Those things weren't all that funny either and ruined any sort of creepy buildup which the movie did have! The creatures and crap were thrown at you so fast and your sitting there kind of thinking, ""wait, when did this movie get so silly? what happened?"" Finally, I didn't dig the ending, it just seemed so rushed that I didn't really care, more simply it lacked any sort of meaning. And then we see it was a dream (I think) which I find to be a big disrespect to the audience and when the kid got the Krampus bell as a gift on Christmas, I was like that's the same ending from the Polar Express!!What I would have liked to see: I think if the only creatures were the Krampus and the elves, the movie would have been a lot stronger. We would have seen more Krampus which would have helped. The movie had this really creepy, original creature that even had some personality to it and it was kind of drowned out by all the other stupid creatures. Krampus looked sick, sounded sick, moved sick but because they had so many other minions happening there wasn't all that much Krampus wreckage going on. The elves were great also, they looked really creepy too but we really didn't see all that much of them until of course the end when everything is thrown in your face. The final thing I really wanted to see happen at the end. The real Santa comes and beats the crap out of the Krampus and kicks him into the lava pit (for a second, I really thought it was going to happen). It would have been the perfect silly ending to a silly stupid movie, it would have worked so well!! The whole movie would have been so worth it if that ending happened. I would have walked out of that theater saying, ""Omg, that was super sick!!""All in all, Krampus wasn't bad just know that its definitely not perfect. Go see it! Tell me what you think!",Krampus
298,chweekweh,Disappointing,3,3 December 2015,"I caught the movie just today. The introduction was drawn out and lengthy, but the premise set up by Max's letter was engaging and showcased the dysfunction rampant in both families in the house. The monsters themselves were terrifying, but the storyline negated most of the excellent appearances of the antagonists. It was repetitive and the characters were very cliché. We have the facepalm-inducing push- pull ""I have to go but you don't want me to go and whoopee, we're wasting so much time crying over me going"", head-smacking ""I don't believe this crap at all so I'm going to do something really stupid right now"" and forehead-clutching ""I'm just going to do the thing no one in the right mind would do"". Hustle, people. You're getting eaten because you're standing in the goddamn snow doing nothing. And really? You're going to make a battle speech and think that horrifying enemy is going to sit there and listen?There was sudden animation in the middle of the movie, which threw me off guard. I mean, what was the point of that? And nothing on Santa's side was really explained. Did Santa decide to screw everyone because one kid stopped believing? He just let the antagonist go ahead and destroy their entire town because of that? That's not very nice, Santa.Some characters seemed to be very immune to the attacks. Not a trace of blood besides at the very start. The ending was a big no no; it was very, very predictable and just an all in all terrible way to sum up the movie.The saving grace for this movie was Aunt Dorothy, if I remember her name correctly. Absolutely hilarious.",Krampus
299,kjmcdani,A future holiday cult classic combining comedy and horror,8,5 December 2015,"""Krampus"" is a cautionary tale for the families that fight and bicker during the holidays. The film really takes a deeper look into how American families have lost the true meaning of Christmas, which is meant to be a time of giving and joyful celebration with loved ones.DIRECTION/PACE The opening scene and following setup scenes of ""Krampus"" define the way Christmas is celebrated in America. The slow motion scramble in the mega store and the following awkward, dissonant exchanges between the family peer into how meaningless and materialistic American society has become. The following family scenes also address the loss of wonder that one experiences when growing up, such as disbelief in Santa. In addition, most of the family members complain about spending time with their cousin counterparts. These scenes drag on for longer than I would have liked.The film transitions from family scenes to thriller scenes. Krampus appears in a fast paced action scene. The first attack occurs and signals that it's time for the horror to start. From this point on the film continues to build up tension as more and more frightening things happen. This build up period is lengthy and has some frustrating moments that lag the action to increase suspense. The main action (which is humorous at points - dependent upon the audience) actually takes place in a short amount of time. It is intense all throughout and will have you jumping and laughing at the disturbing creatures. This is followed by the climax of the film - the up close unveiling of Krampus. The falling action is a ""flight"" from the horrors and the ending is quick, but satisfactory. There is a strong message and not some cheesy cop out. The ending is unexpected, despite what some other reviews would lead you to believe - lots of hindsight heroes out there.Ultimately, I felt the pace and direction could be improved. Less setup, a little less tension building, and a little more horror action+gore would have helped balance out the film. ""Krampus"" provided the horror excellently and I'm pleased it isn't just another ""jump scare"" film. It blends thriller, horror, and comedy well.CINEMATOGRAPHY As said before, the slow motion brawling in the mega store is brilliant. The film uses lots of low, closeup, and unique angles that work well in the horror genre. The camera during the outside chase scene where Krampus is jumping from roof to roof makes it exciting - the camera is aimed perpendicular and up close to the character with Krampus in the background. There is also a nice closeup shot of a used Santa candle that had two streams of red candle wax running down the head as if Santa is bleeding. Excellent use of foreshadowing with characters lurking in the background. The haze of the blizzard added to the intensity and ""fear"", meanwhile use of underexposure in some scenes created apprehension. Overall, the cinematography in ""Krampus"" is well done and stays true to the genre.WRITING The plot of the movie is an innovative twist on the Krampus folklore in an American setting. The characters are believable and mostly stayed true to themselves. The only real break in any character comes from the grandmother who goes from speaking only German to English suddenly. There is not much character development to be had. There is no ""growth"" from the events that happened other than characters regrets of hostility. Again, the cautionary tale aspect is really where the message is delivered - the end result of their actions.EDITING ""Krampus"" flows well throughout the course of the film. Scene transitions were not jarring and there are no bad ""cuts"". The film does an excellent job with use of CGI elements. CGI is used intelligently and as an enhancement of the scene, never replacing it. Where CGI fails often, to me, is when it's overused for beings that need to move ""naturally"". This is not an issue in ""Krampus""!COSTUME DESIGN The costumes are spot on. All the characters are wearing traditional Christmas garb - big coats, hats, gloves, knit sweaters, etc. They even went far enough to distinguish between Tom's family (Adam Scott) and Howard's family (David Koechner) wealth gap. All of the evil Krampus ""helpers"", the ""sleigh"", the ""reindeer"", etc. are mostly real props that were expertly touched up (with CGI). I really enjoyed the close up scenes of Krampus, there is great attention to detail to make him look like the real deal - hooves and horns and all!SET DESIGN ""Krampus"" takes place in the perfect modern day Christmas movie location - what I would call a ""Home Alone"" suburbia. The location not only fit the film perfectly, but it looks just like a frozen nightmare. The house, creepy snowmen, the blizzard, the recently abandoned/dead house, etc.SCORE/SOUNDTRACK ""Krampus"" features popular Christmas tunes serve as background music or in a creepy way, either to add suspense to tense moments or ""altered"" to create a horror effect - such as played with an odd instrument or particular emphasis on certain notes (such as holding them longer) that distinguishes from the original piece. The score emphasizes the movie and moods of the scenes so well it melds right into every scene.As a whole, ""Krampus"" does a lot of things right. There are a few shortcomings in the character writing and pace. The story accomplishes what it was set out to do and still very much entertains. The film is a great break from the usual Christmas garbage while still conveying a very important message - don't lose sight of the spirit of Christmas! (In a non-religious point of view).",Krampus

305,ButcherOfLuverne,"Funny, yet Grim and Darkly Atmospheric",8,8 December 2015,"Michael Doughtery, who directed ""Trick R Treat"", brings a rather offbeat but overall enjoyable concept to his latest film based on the Alpine folk legend, ""Krampus"".Krampus stars a very talented cast, featuring Toni Colette and Adam Scott in the lead roles, David Koechner, Alison Tolman and Cochenta Farrell in supporting roles, and Emjay Anthony as the heart of the story, Max. Max is a young boy who has lost his Christmas spirit when he family becomes more and more distant from each other and have pretty much given up on Christmas. Things are made worse by his bullying cousins and the arrival of his aunt and uncle. Eventually, Max snaps, and tears up his letter to Santa Claus then tosses it out the window. This summons the ancient beast himself, Krampus, a demonic goat-like creature who wrecks havoc on those who have lost the Christmas spirit. This launches all sorts of mayhem, including a pretty damn suspenseful chase through the snow with some of Dougherty's best cinematography to date. The cast does a pretty good job; Emjay Anthony is a good child actor so he's convincing as a kid who misses his younger years when Christmas was simpler. The adult cast is quite top-notch, with Koechner ringing off some very funny dialogue, particularly one after he faces off with some crazy Christmas cookies. Tolman and Colette have some nice, tender moments as sisters but aren't doing anything incredible; they have proved themselves to be capable performers in the past so here is no different. Cochenta Farrell, who plays the bitter, drunkard Great Aunt Dorothy provides as the main comic relief in particularity darker scenes of the film, and she does so with such finesse that its hard not to enjoy her sour attitude. The main stars, however, are the minions of Krampus. Aside from a group of CGI Gingerbread men and one beastly teddy bear, all the effects in this film are animatronics and puppets provided by Weta Workshop, including Krampus himself. The minions of Krampus are incredibly creatively designed; an intimidating crew of atmospheric yet useless snowmen, a stabby robot toy, a creepy Christmas angel, and, possibly best of all, a snake-like jack-in-the-box that swallows children whole. These minions set the perfect tone; creepy, eerie, and even freakish if you find a sharp-toothed clown and slimy tongued angel scary but also are very fun. They have personality; they have a mischievous way about them, and the giggle and clap with glee when they achieve their goals of chaos.The movie overall has this tone; fun and giddy but still grim, dark and somewhat gruesome at certain times. The film doesn't shy away from showing one small obese child being dragged up a chimney with chains and hooks.Luckily, it tackles this darkness with a warm-hearted Christmas message of hope and some good comedy. Krampus himself is kept in the shadows mostly, and we only see him for a few (but memorable) scenes for the first two acts. However, after an incredibly suspenseful build up reveal of a fireplace entrance, the final act focuses it's entirety on Krampus. The film has two flaws, however. Though they aren't film ruining, they are just a bit noticeable. First, the snowmen; I loved these things. The snowmen provided a great sense of sinister atmosphere and looked legitimately menacing. But I wish they had more to do with the chaos that ensues in the film; they mostly are just there to look creepy but they never come to life, which is a bit of wasted potential. It would've been interesting to see them move around, adding some more creepiness to the movie. The second flaw is the CGI on the gingerbread men; though this movie uses practical effects almost entirely, the gingerbread me were computerized. They aren't bad looking, by any means, but they don't look like they really are there in the environment. That's a bit of a nitpick but, overall, I can see myself watching this every Christmas for a good message of family togetherness, as well as some madcap mayhem involving a hooved demon goat. 8/10.",Krampus
306,lindseynwoodward,Abysmal.,3,7 December 2015,"This movie had a lot of potential but turned out to be a steaming pile of cat crap.First, it starts out almost reminiscent of a John Hughes feel-good holiday movie and then almost out of nowhere the ""horror"" begins. After a brief and fairly impressive scene featuring Krampus leaping across rooftops in pursuit of the teenage daughter Beth, he's barely seen until the climax and is instead replaced by a slew of minions, some of which include gingerbread men, a carnivorous jack in the box, a demonic angel, and dwarfs. The physical representation of Krampus himself was disappointing to say the least.I would have kept as much folkloric authenticity as possible in a film like this and produced it with a low budget and included a tonne of gore. Actually, I would make Ash vs Krampus. That would be cool.The parts intended to be humorous were not, with the exception of a couple scenes featuring the minions, and the scary parts relied on loud, jumpy intrusions. The ending was predictable. All a dream! Forever trapped in a snow globe! What a twist.My expectations were low and even they were not met. I only give it a generous 3 stars because I laughed 3 times throughout the entire film. These people saying it will become a cult classic are delusional. Don't waste your time on this drivel. I hope Krampus drags every person associated with its making straight to the bowels of hell and forces them to watch it on infinite repeat.",Krampus
307,bobtheskull-88240,"Remarkably well done, & remarkably maligned",9,8 December 2015,"You know that sense of duty you feel sometimes when watching patriotic movies? You know, the old, ""somebody's got to stand up for what's right"" kind of shtick that sappy, emotional dramas love to smack audiences with so that they can be nominated for awards while being carried on a tide of tears and guilt? That's more or less how I feel about this review on Krampus, but in this case it's because I'm quite fed up with reading professional reviews of the film. I don't think any of the critics that I stumbled across had more than one or two kind words for Krampus, and that seems like a disservice to me because this film isn't bad -- in fact, it's really good. So this is me trying to set the record straight. If you're looking for a TL;DR sort of line so that you can skip reading the rest of this: ""Krampus isn't perfect, but has likable characters, beautiful design, and produces enough tension to baffle an army of massage-therapists. If you aren't bothered with a PG-13 Horror movie, or are willing to wait for the unrated version, strongly consider watching it."" For those of you who watched the trailers put out for Krampus, I'm sure that the beginning of film didn't hold much in the way of surprises for you. We're thrust into the story of a young boy named Max who is so disheartened both by the general air of marketing- driven greediness, and by the unpleasant attitudes of his family, that he throws away his own holiday spirit. Since we are talking about a Horror movie, this sort of thing can only ever lead to curses or monsters; and sure enough, Max's ill feelings draw down the ire of Krampus: a Germanic spirit whose job is to punish those who are on the Naughty section of Santa's list. Soon, Max and his family are trapped in their house by a blizzard of epic proportions, all while Krampus and his minions stalk them and pick off family members one by one; and if all of this sounds very familiar to you, then you've probably ridden on the Horror express a time or two. Krampus doesn't set out to make major waves in the genre, and is on very friendly terms with the clichés we've all come to know and love. But it doesn't take an utterly original movie to be good, and Krampus has to be my favorite new Horror movie that I've seen in a long while. For one thing, Krampus' actors are all very good. None of them are people that I recognize off-hand, which is a little unusual for movies nowadays; but every single one of them pulls their weight, and manages to come across as being more than just a walking plot device -- which is excellent. Nothing kills the mood in a movie where people are picked off one-by-one like unreal-seeming characters. Another point in Krampus' favor is that every critter that makes its way onto the screen looks absolutely horrifying in the best possible way. Dougherty did similar things with creature design in Trick 'r Treat, and it really pays off in this movie with evil clowns, elves, dolls, and pretty much anything else you can think of that's vaguely Christmas related. Cinematography is similarly fantastic-looking, and really does its job in establishing a mood. In fact, the more I think about the film, the more I realize that the only negative thing that I have to say is that the ending could have been a little better. Without wishing to spoil anything, there's a part near the end where it would have been absolutely devastating to drop the curtain and simply leave the story, and the film fails to capitalize on this. Still, the ending isn't absolute crap, and considering how good of an impression the rest of the movie left on me, it would have taken an ending on par with a natural disaster to change my opinions. Which leads me somewhat unevenly to my next thought: I don't understand where the negative professional critique on Krampus is coming from. Perhaps the most baffling comments for me (and there are a lot of them) are the ones that claim that Krampus is comedy, and fails to hit the mark in terms of humor. I might have missed something, what with my jaw resting on the floor while I stared at the terrifying- looking jack-in-the-box, but I really detected little to no comedic vibe from Krampus. There are some scenes which pay a certain amount of homage to movies like Evil Dead, but nothing I saw struck me as being intended in a comical light; in fact, the only reason that I can fathom for people believing that Krampus is partially a comedy is that there were rumors circulating around the Web to that affect. In fact, the more I've read through critics' comments, the more strongly I'm struck by the bizarre feeling that none of them actually paid much attention to the film. Maybe this suspicion is nothing more than my bias showing, but I have difficulty in accepting that a reviewer has actually watched the movie when they try to sell me on the idea that the plot revolves around Liberal vs Conservative stereotypes. (Yes, that is an actual example.) More than anything else, though, I think that the feeling of disconnect between myself and the reviewers is mostly due to the fact that few of them seem to be looking at the movie from the standpoint of Horror. As has been paraphrased uncounted numbers of times, real Horror is only possible when faced with the unknown and mysterious; and none of the reviewers whose works I've read seem to have had the patience for this. Which is a shame, both because it's harder to review a movie which you don't give a chance to, and because they missed out on what I'd call a very good time.",Krampus
308,tomv-64744,I'd rather have Krampus come down my chimney than St. Nick!,9,10 December 2015,"Krampus offers some much needed counter programming this holiday season. While I enjoyed the film wholly there were some issues that kept me from really loving it. So first I'll talk about what bugged me.Obviously from early on we know that Grandma knows what's going on but what bugged me is she has a conversation in German and her grandson continues to speak English. We do have subtitles but later on she has a few lines without subtitles so a little consistency here would have been made it work. Also, there's no reason she keeps her family in the dark as to what's going on other than to keep the audience in suspense but it doesn't work because we are watching a movie called Krampus. We know what's going on.Next, I can's suspend my belief that Tom and his wife would let their daughter go for a 4 block hike in an awful blizzard alone... so no.My biggest peeve is this flick needed to be R. It needed gore, legitimate gore. This film is kind of a mash up of other horror films but I got a major Evil Dead vibe and I so wanted to see some blood and guts and it really left me longing. This is a key component that could have taken this flick to the next level.Of course the third act ruined everything. If you're going to go all in and give us a film about something as cool as Krampus then give us a third act that can knock our socks off. The family's plan is to get to an abandoned truck with a plow however the parents get offed and expect the 10 and 8 year old to drive a 5 speed. Uh no...Fortunately everything else is excellent. The opening credits scene is absolutely spell binding, funny, and bitingly satirical.Krampus himself and his minions are so well crafted from their appearances to their sound design, they deliver on exactly what I wanted from these characters.The animated sequence is top notch.I was really impressed with Adam Scott and Toni Collete's performances. The hardest thing they are able to achieve is a balanced tone of humor, fear, terror, and hopelessness which is really difficult to do.The set design, camera shots, and editing really set the right tone.Overall Krampus is a success that will become a holiday viewing staple for me and my family.

It seems unreasonable. If we're even going for the whole, ""Keep the Christmas Spirit in your heart or Krampus will stick a knife up your butt"" type of supernatural, unrealistic plot then where the heck was Santa? Early in the movie, it was already established that Santa did not exist, so why the heck does Krampus? Does that make any sense? How are we supposed to keep the spirit alive when Santa doesn't even exist? There is literally no reason. Also, what of the people that aren't even Christian?

It's been awhile since there has been a really good dark Christmas film and Krampus definitely delivered that.The movie itself wasn't very scary but it definitely had some twisted elements to it. From the horrifying toys - the Jack-In-The-Box was my personal favourite - to the ways Krampus & his elves messed with the family, it was a wild ride. Towards the end of the film - about the 3/4 mark - the plot started to drop off a bit but the ending totally pulled me back in. It's one of those moments where you're led to believe one thing - which kind of makes you go ""aw, really?"" - and then totally twists it around, leaving you relieved and kind of excited that it ends the way it does. Not to mention the song in the credits was pretty sweet. The overall writing of the film was fairly well done. It had lots of quick & witty humour and the cast chosen delivered it quite well.The film was light-hearted, funny and horrific all at the same time. While I don't think it'll win any major awards, it's definitely worth checking out this holiday season. It'll make you think twice about losing faith in the Christmas spirit.",Krampus

While in Polar Express the child protagonist's youth-like wonder brings the Christmas spirit back into his family, this protagonist (Emjay Anthony) and his belief in the true spirit of Christmas (which hinges oddly with his German speaking grandma) comes to an end causing all hell to break loose. Krampus comes to punish those who don't believe and the audience is taken into a spiral of ridiculous scenes coupled with horrendous cinematography in which Krampus and his demented yet laughable minions come to terrorize the cliché family.""Rebellious daughter with stoner boyfriend"" (Stefania LaVie Owen) goes out into a terrible blizzard without a phone to check on her boyfriend. Of course this is perfectly reasonable to the unsuspecting parents and is even more ridiculous when she doesn't return to which Tom (Adam Scott) responds with complete ease. Its as if Micheal Daugherty set up the plot to enter Krampus in the most convenient way possible with no hindrance to the practicality of the viewer. The rest of the family, including the insecure parents, alcoholic aunt, rowdy uncle who bashes on his brother in law, and irritatingly unintelligent cousins, are left to deal with the rest of the Krampus ""horrors"". It is a relief for me to see David Koechner in the film due to his amusing roles in comedies such as Anchorman and he does provide with interspersed one-liners. Unfortunately this is destroyed entirely when he is attacked by an onslaught of angry gingerbread men. Three more of the children are abducted while a possessed jack-in-the-box, angel, and teddy bear terrorize the family and you can't help but wonder why/how no one is shooting these things with the two loaded guns they are holding. Although Krampus looked like a prop I could pick up at a Halloween outlet and his elves didn't look much better, the truly unrealistic part was the script and convenience of each and every encounter with the evil Christmas knockoffs. Each scene where the characters were standing paralyzed (presumably by the appalling special effects) left me split between laughter at the horrible writing and the resounding mantra ""do SOMETHING dammit"". This finally ended when Tom spits out the most memorable line in the movie ""Finish it"" to which alcoholic aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell) responds intensely ""With pleasure"" and proceeds to blow the brains out of the giant jack-in- the-box that consumed his cousin whole. I couldn't help but laugh with my fellow movie goers as climax eased into resolution with Krampus. Keep the childlike wonder of the Christmas spirit from Polar Express and instead add in the poorly portrayed dark underbelly of Christmas folklore along with an incompetent script and you have Krampus. An uneasy mash-up of Christmas horror with a family friendly back splash; the two simply don't mix.",Krampus

It's by no means 100% accurate but it fulfills his purpose: to be scary, to be feared and to teach a lesson that one should be good or else...The story starts out slow with an ever decreasing pacing til the end where i get the feeling it was too fast and everything was over in a flash.Krampus little helpers are a mixed bag, some of them are very... VERY creepy while others seem goofy.If you are in the mood for a movie that likes to switch between grim themes and light comedic moments than you are gonna like this one.",Krampus
316,elisabethmp,Awful,1,7 May 2016,"I thought due to the other reviews this would be a fun, crazy movie. I was right about the crazy part. I am a horror movie lover and this was the worst movie I've ever seen. Im shocked these great actors were in such a terrible movie. The acting was great the story was great, however, the elves and Krampus himself were just people wearing masks and it was awful. Krampus is supposed to be an evil, twisted, shocking terrifying version of Santa and this was a guy in a mask! The mask wasn't even scary, it looked like a hunch back version of regular Santa. What a waste of time and money! Very disappointing. Maybe if there was some CGI effects or something to make the movie more effective but it was flat and terrible. Don't waste your money, wait till it comes to TV or something.",Krampus
317,bymwesigwa,Dreadful,1,1 June 2016,"Krampus was the most bogus movie i almost watched, designed with the intention of promoting the western deceitful myth of Santa Claus. Really, instead of going around creating these idiotic devilish movies why don't these so called renown USA producers create Jesus films, since it His birthday we celebrate in the first place?. personally i consider such movies harbouring racist intents to continue slavery ideologies of these DCs. Anyway who really am i to talk since after all i have no experience in these movie producing and directing but overall what a puke of a movie and interestingly it won many bogus awards useless really useless.",Krampus
318,painter-35428,A good yarn but not a horror,7,7 August 2016,"Krampus is what I would call a 'Sunday film.' When you've been out the night before and there's nothing on TV. The reason I start with that point is that to enjoy Krampus you must switch off your brain and ignore all logic. The film is not a bad way to spend an hour and a half but not a great way either.Krampus describes itself as a horror but it's definitely better positioned as a fantasy.There are no real scares per say. That said the creature designs are good and Krampus himself is quite sinister. The film does want to be funny, however it never straddles both horror and comedy quite like 'Tucker and Dale vs Evil' did before it. So go get yourself a bag full of sweets and settle in to some no nonsense good fun. Just don't expect to be scared.",Krampus
319,paddyboy-31595,Waste of a great idea.,1,8 November 2016,"Horror comedies haven't always been my favourite mix of genres. The  idea is a real juxtaposition and puts me off being truly horrified or  dulls down the comedy in non-comedic circumstances. Since I have heard  of Krampus before and have seen a few great horror comedies like Shaun  of the Dead I'll put my preconceptions about the movie to one side.  After watching the movie I feel like it should have been full horror  and leave out the pathetic and forced attempts of comedy via awful  characters or crude slapstick. Krampus is met through an oddly placed  cartoon which felt a little more Disney and a little less Tim Burton  that I think it should have done. Throughout the rest of the movie  however, his ever looming presence was a great source of terror and  really created most of the horror in the movie. Unfortunately, we see  much more of his ""minions"" than him, which may not be so bad but the  minions are actually 3 gingerbread men, an owl with a doll's head  (yeah, it does sound cool, doesn't it?), a very useless teddy bear, a  large jack- in-the-box and some Oompa-Loompas in tiki masks with Greek  letters sharpie-d onto their heads. Krampus may have been worth the  wait if he hadn't ended up being a bloke in a latex mask with a blanket  over his head who's had a little too much Christmas pudding. Perhaps if  he had been gifted with a little more mystery and special effects, just  to keep him scary, he may have made me consider this a worthwhile wait  instead of making me not care about the characters who got eaten. Also,  there are a few inconsistencies and plot holes with this movie. No  rhyme or reason has been given as to why any character is sacrificed or  taken before the others; they aren't particularly naughty within the  30s between their mates getting captured so I'm not sure as to why  Krampus holds off. The sweet old grandma notices the house is shaking  and everyone is slowly disappearing but fails to mention that she knows  exactly what's happening until a couple minor characters are dead.  But above all else, the most frustrating, horrid and awful thing that  this movie does is in its ending.  The infamous ""It was all a dream"" ending where everything goes balls up  and the writers can't undo the dead-end ending they have created so  instead erase everything and say that nothing matters, except for some  stupid paradoxical memento makes a character stop and look at the  camera and ask themselves ""was it all a dream?"". I sure hope this  terrible movie does not have a sequel but I am hoping for a remake with  actual horror, more Krampus and some plot consistency.",Krampus
320,casehardened-04652,Good - Could have been Great - SPOILERS !!!!,6,26 November 2016,"SPOILERS !!OK, when it come to Christmas Movies I'm just a softie.I liked how, initially, adversity brought the family together, and would have preferred if that theme was continued.But it soon degenerates into a violent free-for-all, with no victory.Where was Santa ? Perhaps he should have intervened and kicked Krampus's ass. And grandma or the aunt ? I would have loved to see either (or both) stand up to the beast and somehow disgrace him.But no.My family still enjoyed it, and I it IS worth viewing.But no classic.",Krampus

322,samkaycoh,Great beginning.... very rough middle & end,3,24 December 2020,"I absolutely LOVED the first 20 minutes of this movie. Great writing, characters, and foreshadowing for the ensuing horror... but as soon as the horror elements came into play- everything else seemed to go out the window. The editing was jumpy, there was little to no plot or character development, and the ending was beyond disappointing. I'm almost upset at this movie because of how much I liked the first act.",Krampus
323,landonwingerson,Terrible,1,24 December 2018,"The cast chosen for this movie does not sit at all, the scripts for the characters are terrible, and the whole plot has absolutely nothing interesting about it. This film might be interesting for a 12 year old to watch. Do not wast your time.",Krampus
