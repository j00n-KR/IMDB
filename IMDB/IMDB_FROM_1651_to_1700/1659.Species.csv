0,Leofwine_draca,Clunky sci-fi alien B-movie,4,29 December 2016,"SPECIES is a B-movie with an A-list cast, nothing more and nothing less than that. Its tired, hackneyed plot is like something out of a '50s alien invasion flick, and the film as a whole is little more than excuse for lots of gratuitous nudity and some gruesome bloodshed along the way. One of the most notable things is that the alien is designed by H. R. Giger, the designer behind the most famous screen Alien of all time, and to hammer the similarities home we have an eerie soundtrack that seems to rip off ALIENS at every single opportunity. Sadly, the only time we really see Giger's work is at the climax, where it's represented by some shoddy CGI effects that I remember thinking were good back in the day. Now, watching this with hindsight, I see that they stink. If only we had more of the cool alien suit and less CGI, I might have enjoyed this a whole lot more.The storyline is so predictable that it's hardly worth bothering with. A female alien in human form attempts to mate with lots of guys, but usually ends up killing them instead. Of course, the good guys are always just behind, and don't meet up with her until the climax. Natasha Henstridge stars in her breakout role as Sil, the alien, but her appearance is little more than an excuse for lots and lots of topless nudity. She doesn't make an impact other than that, and neither does Michelle Williams playing the young Sil. More interesting are Michael Madsen, delivering an adequate hard-ass character with little material to go on, and Marg Helgenberger cast as a love interest before C.S.I. came along. Ben Kingsley is here too, but he just seems weird, while Alfred Molina is trying too hard as the oh-so-British professor. I did like Forest Whitaker, though, who brings warmth and depth to his role as an 'empath', somebody with a psychic link to Henstridge's killer.A predictable ending involving characters being stalked through the sewers and a ridiculous killer baby aside, this is for the most part routine fare. There's one outrageous gore scene where a woman has her spine ripped out in a toilet cubicle and one decent suspense scene in which a couple of the characters are trapped in a sealed room with a rapidly growing alien organism. Other than that, SPECIES is a film just not really worth bothering with.",Species
1,SnoopyStyle,Alien in a pretty package,7,26 April 2015,"In 1993, SETI program receives a transmission documenting how to splice alien DNA with human DNA. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) leads a secret government project to do just that. They created Sil (Michelle Williams). Her growth is extremely rapid. When Fitch tries to destroy her, she escapes. She metamorphoses into a grow woman (Natasha Henstridge). She learns quickly in a world she doesn't know. Fitch gathers a diverse team to find and kill the potentially dangerous creature. Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina) is an anthropologist. Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) is a molecular biologist. Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker) is an empath and Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen) is the mercenary.There is enough backstory to justify it. I really like the idea that she's interstellar weed to kill off humanity. It's Alien in a pretty package. Alien is one of my favorite movie and I certainly don't mind the pretty package. Natasha Henstridge is a little more than simply pretty. She shows both wide-eyed innocence and a bit of murderous spark. The empath is ridiculous but I still like the hunt and the thrills.",Species
2,claudio_carvalho,One of the Best Sci-Fis of the 90's,7,22 November 2007,"For thirty years, powerful telescopes have been scanning the space searching from signal of alien civilization. In 1974, the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) team sends a message to the space with the human DNA, map of our solar system and other information. In return, they receive two messages: the first one, with a catalyst for methane; the second, a detailed alien DNA together with instructions to join it with human DNA. The result of the experiment is the deadly creature Sil. When Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley), who is leading the research, decides to terminate the experiment, the girl Sil (Michelle Williams) escapes to Los Angeles. Dr. Fitch joins the mercenary Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen); the anthropologist Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina); the scientist Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger); and the empathic Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker) to chase Sil (Natasha Henstridge). Sooner they discover that the predator Sil has grown-up and became a beautiful woman, trying to copulate to generate an offspring.""Species"" is one of the best sci-fis of the 90's. Full of action, sexy and with a great cast, this film introduces the stunning Natasha Henstridge, one of the most gorgeous and sexy actresses of Hollywood ever. Her debut could not be better, and together with the cult Michael Madsen, they make this pleasant movie work. The story recalls those B-movies from the 50's, but spiced with erotic and very sexy scenes. I have just watched this movie for the fourth time, and I do not get tired to this attractive story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Experiência"" (""The Experience"")",Species
3,kosmasp,What a cast,8,23 October 2020,"I guess it was 25 years I last saw this ... before the other day when I rewatched it to refresh my memory. I am very certain that I was not too aware of the cast back then. I mean ... wow! Sure they all may have done some lesser movies on their own and this is not a blockbuster or high budget movie, but just the fact you have all those people assembled here - even Michelle Williams as a kid. Reminds me of Kirsten Dunst first role in Interview with a Vampire in a way.But back to this and it is as B-movie as they can get. And I don't mean that in a bad way (as you can already see with my rating), but in a good nonsense and fun kind of way. Nudity and violence with an idea that is quite out there. Still tough to pull those off if you don't have some good people in front and behind the camera. This is really good fun, if you are not expecting a blockbuster movie. I might watch the sequels sometime, but for now I am more than happy that I watched this again ... so much ridiculous fun",Species
4,classicsoncall,"""She was half us, half something else.""",7,25 May 2014,"When this first came out I had high hopes that it would be a sci-fi thriller along the lines of ""Alien"" or ""Predator"", but sadly, that was not to be. In fact, it's more comparable to a blend of soft porn and sci-fi gone astray, what with the inner Sil resembling an Alien knock-off in those mesmerizing dream sequences. I don't think we can blame it on the high power cast with Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Forest Whittaker and Marg Helgenberger on hand. I think they needed more to work with.Now as far as Natasha Henstridge goes, think what might have happened to her movie career if she didn't debut with this effort. Not exactly a household name, even if you could pronounce it. The thing is, she's simply stunning in the film, and that's with her clothes on. Notice I mention nothing about her acting.It's almost inconceivable to me that there were a couple of sequels to this movie, though the ending obviously begged for it. I may get around to them at some point, with the same kind of urgency I attach to Japanese Godzilla flicks, beach movies and Seventies martial arts films. Which is to say, I can wait a while.",Species
5,gavin6942,A Defining 1990s Science Fiction,6,30 June 2017,"A group of scientists try to track down and trap a killer alien seductress (Natasha Henstridge) before she successfully mates with a human.The film was conceived by writer Dennis Feldman in 1987 while working on ""Real Men"", another alien story; he had recently achieved success with ""The Golden Child"". The ""Species"" story was originally pitched in the style of a police procedural called ""The Message"". For whatever reason, ""Message"" failed to find the same level of interest as ""Golden Child"". In an interestingly twist, he modified it and called it a spec script, and it was picked up! With MGM and director Roger Donaldson (""Cocktail"") involved, the budget became rather respectable. The effects crew consisted of legendary H. R. Giger (""Alien""), the lovable Steve Johnson, and Richard Edlund (""Ghostbusters""). MGM was open to Giger's input on the script, as he feared some aspects might be too close to the ""Alien"" franchise and would typecast him. Giger had a massive set of props produced and ready to go. He made new drawings very day, focusing on every minute aspect from the inner workings of the alien to the feet. Steve Johnson has noted that 99% of Giger's art is female, which makes him particularly apt for the job. His finished work actually looks more like an homage to ""Metropolis"" than a redux of ""Alien"", which is always a good thing.We even get composer Christopher Young, whose score is vaguely reminiscent of his earlier ""Hellraiser"" work. Strangely, although Young had worked on many films (mostly horror) since ""The Dorm That Dripped Blood"" (1982), he has claimed that ""Species"" was the first one that actually had him working in Los Angeles. This relocation could very well have been his turning point for bigger budget and non-genre films. The cast is arguably the most impressive of any horror or science fiction film of the 1990s. The film stars Natasha Henstridge in her debut role, and to date (2017) the role she is best known for. But we also have heavy hitters Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger. A pre-fame Michelle Williams carries the beginning of the film, and watching this years later it is fascinating to see that this young woman has blossomed into an Oscar-caliber actress. As others have pointed out, the top-notch cast is what really elevates this from a B-movie (something Roger Corman would have made) to a major motion picture.Although critics were less than thrilled by the picture, seeing it as sort of fluffy and relying heavily on nudity to carry the picture, it still was a success. Budgeted at $35 million, the film earned a total of $113 million worldwide. And, loved or hated, it really made its mark on pop culture, being one of the more memorable science fiction films more than twenty years on. The story really sticks with you. And, it never hurts to have three (!!) sequels.The Scream Factory Blu-ray release is phenomenal, pure and simple. They have ported over the special features from the earlier DVD release, which included two audio commentaries and a wide selection of interviews. But then they go above and beyond, giving the film a 4K scan from the interpositive, so you know it will look far better than it ever did on DVD or VHS. And if those old interviews and commentaries were not enough, they have an all-new making-of documentary with Christopher Young, Steve Johnson, and many others. The focus is strongly on the special effects and creature design, which means plenty of entertaining anecdotes from Johnson.",Species
6,lee_eisenberg,"Learn to accept it as a near porno flick, and it's quite fun",5,15 July 2007,"While ""Species"" has as its actual plot a group of scientists looking for an escaped alien specimen - did somebody say ""Alien"" ripoff? - I derived that the whole movie was really an excuse to show off Natasha Henstridge's breasts. If in fact that was the film's purpose, then they did a pretty good job with it (seriously, not many movies get sexier than this). If the flick was supposed to have any real purpose beyond that, then I don't know what they were thinking. Just accept that the movie probably got made with the aim of sexually arousing teenage boys, and it'll be perfectly easy to enjoy the flick. Personally, I wouldn't mind getting slinky with that alien babe! Also starring Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger and Forest Whitaker. I don't know whether or not they want to stress this film when discussing their careers.",Species
7,jboothmillard,Species,5,15 December 2007,"I had always seen this film a few minutes in, and I knew the cast pretty well, so I knew I had to see the entire film to really appreciate or dismiss it. From director Roger Donaldson (Dante's Peak), this film starts with a little girl, named Sil (Dawson's Creek's Michelle Williams) inside a large see-through dome, and a few seconds later has a gas pumped in to kill her, and she obviously escapes. This girl is now on the run, and Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) has brought together a group of experts in their own ways to help exterminate the girl. This group consist of mercenary Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen) who is there only to kill something, anthropologist Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina), scientist Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger), and Empath (who can feel things, i.e. what another is feeling, their intention, their reason for something, and if they are close or where they have been recently) Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker). We discover that (obviously) this girl is not ordinary, she may look like a human, but behind closed doors and before a victim will be killed by her, she is a new species. Basically over many years the scientist satellites have been sent alien codes with instructions to join their DVA with humans, they tried this with five due babies, only one (Sil) was allowed to live. Anyway, Sil has now fully grown into a mature adult (introducing the attractive Natasha Henstridge), and learning more and more human traits, she is desperate now to find a healthy human man to help her breed, in other words, with her increased speed of growth, she wants to make a baby. The film consists mainly of loads of chases, alien deaths, near misses and quite a bit of nudity, till eventually Stephen is victim to her conception, and death of course, and finale sees all surviving characters tracking the now hideous looking creature down underground. The special effects may not be absolutely superb, but they are pretty cool in moments, and I found Whitaker's character a little weird, even though he is helpful in the story, and a great actor, so in whole, quite a good once in awhile film. Worth watching!",Species
8,rmax304823,"""I Think She Wants To Mate.""",5,25 August 2011,"An exciting combination of pursuit thriller, science fiction, erotic adventures, and a mind-numbing piece of utter garbage.A genetic scientist working for the government gets hold of some alien DNA, combines it with human DNA, and produces a cute young blond girl who seems to be growing with lightning speed. The girl escapes and turns into Natasha Henstridge who wanders around Los Angeles looking for a mate. She wants to get pregnant because the alien part of her has been sent here to propagate and destroy the humans. The human part of her is already beginning to hear the ticking of her biological clock. All kinds of killings, near-copulations, and titillations follow.Let me get the members of the A team right. Ben Kingsley is the scientist responsible for the creation of Henstridge. Marg Helgenberger is maybe a clinical psychologist. Michael Madsen is the professional assassin for some government agency. Forest Whitaker is the ""empathic"" who is able to read emotional vibrations. Afred Molina is the goofy looking professor of anthropology from Harvard.I didn't care for Molina's character at all. I was a professor of anthropology for years and nobody ever ""paid for my drinks"" while pursuing anybody like Natasha Henstridge. Of course I wasn't a professor at HARVARD, just a state university, but still. On top of his being pampered by the government and everybody else, he's the one who gets to impregnate Henstridge. I was glad when she tore him apart.Of the other team members, I wondered what a fine actor like Ben Kingsley is doing in this slapdash lunge for the buck. Ditto Forest Whitaker and Marg Helgenberger, both of whom have more to offer than what they're allowed to put on display here. Michael Madsen, I was happy to see, has the role of cynical hero, a change from his usual character whose sadistic traits, if they had a face, would resemble that of a Turkish pederast.I kind of enjoyed Natasha Henstridge, especially when she was naked, which is roughly half the time. Wow. She's a lissome, toothsome blond and very tall. When my mind wandered, as it tended to when she was clothed, I found myself wondering if, put together, she, Mariel Hemingway, and Uma Thurman might not provide the foundation for a decent girl's basketball team. What made the fantasy attractive was that they were playing the game dressed only in bikinis and high heels.Not that Henstridge is without problems, both as actress and character. Her role as alien who learns mostly from observing others, limits her speech to only a few lines. It's just as well, considering the way she delivers them. But her weakness as a thespian is more than made up for by her magnificent figure. We don't get to see enough of it, if you ask me.That's Henstridge the actress. The alien character has a different set of problems. First, she has a nasty temper. When her first victim is eager to impregnate her but she senses he has some heritable medical problem, she thrusts her tongue so far into his mouth that it comes out the back of his head. Now, that's overdoing it.She's in the Jacuzzi with prospect number two, both naked and about to do it, when the phone rings. He wants to interrupt the proceedings and answer it but she's anxious to get going. When he insists, she turns into her alien form and disarticulates him. The scene caused a horrifying flashback to my marriage.A few words about her alien form, which we get to see in its most revolting aspect at the climax. In the Jacuzzi, it assumes the kind of demonic form that is Judeo-Christian in nature. She looks like our usual conception of Satan, with vertical pupils and pointed ears. The origin of that figure is not from outer space, it's from the Middle East of thousands of years ago. I make this observation as your personal anthropologist. That will be fifteen cents. Or a billet doux from someone who looks just like Henstridge in her human form.But -- just listen to this special offer! For fifteen cents I will throw in the observation that in her FINAL form, in the sewer beneath the hotel, she shows distinctly mammalian characteristics -- her breasts, her hair (cf., the bride of Frankenstein), her reproductive organs -- and yet she retains certain reptilian traits, like scales, that natural selection should have dropped long ago. Moreover, some of her features seem to be either plastic or metal. What the hell kind of evolution do you call this? We evolve into creatures of plastic? And thermosets at that, because both the alien and her newborn baby fall into a lake of fire and that's that.Not that the movie misses the cliché of the supposedly dead body leaping back into life -- or any of the other formulaic jolts we've come to expect from strictly commercial ventures like this. There are a multitude of CGIs, mostly disgusting slimy worm-like things that strangle people or suck out their brains and -- well, you get the picture. I'll mention the final cliché. When the creature is destroyed and the team departs the field in victory, a bit of limp alien flesh is left behind. A sewer rat nibbles on it, then flashes out a tiny alien tongue and consumes another rat. This is the signal that there is to be a sequel -- ""Species II"" -- which followed apace.Ugh.",Species
9,ma-cortes,"Sci-fi and fantasy movie about an alien on loose, mercilessly chased by a team of brave scientists",6,19 April 2020,"A friendly galactic message packing a recipe on how to combine extraterrestrial DNA with human is sent to genetic scientifics on Earth. The scientists led by Fitch : Ben Kingley, undergo the weird experiment resulting in a sexy half alien, half human, she is called Sil. But Sil, - as teen played by Michelle Williams and as an adult by Natasha Henstridge-, is a killing machine who escapes from the investigation laboratory and Fitch forms a expert team: Michael Madsen, Forest Whitaker, Alfred Molina, Marg Helgenberger to find her.

As the alien Sil disguised as a human is pursued desperately by the colleague scientists, while the monster has to hunt down especially nubile male prey to procreate her alien race. As she seduces young people into mating to produce a baby to expand her descendants on Earth.
Enjoyable Sci-fi movie with noisy action, stomach-churning thrills, tension, intrigue, violence, state-of-art FX , strong sexual scenes, nudism and lots of gore and guts . It is a nice but so-so thriller with no much sense, but it results to be pretty entertaining and amusing, following in the distinct wake of the Science Fiction movies of the Fifties. All-star special effects including great technicians as Dennis Muren, Richard Edlund and the famous artist-designer HR Giger, all of them create a fantastic and strange creature. This one is played by Natasha Henstridge, in his film debut, subsequently to play a long career as cinema as Television. The cast is frankly excellent with several familiar faces formed by an agreeable and attractive group who carry out an unenviable and relentless task of catching her.It contains a mysterious and thrilling musical score by Christopher Young, a good musician expert on terror and dark atmosphere. As well as colorful but shading cinematography by Andrezj Bartkowiak who has also directed some films. The motion picture was regularly directed by Roger Donaldson. This filmmaker is a good artisan who has made some successful films, such as : The recruit, Thirteen days, Dante's Peak, The getaway , White sands , Cadillac man , Cocktail, No way out, Marie, Nutcase, The Bounty, Smash palace. Sleeping dogs, among others. Rating 5.5/10. Passable and acceptable but mediocre.It is followed by two inferior sequels : Species 2, 1998 by Peter Medak with Justin Lazard, Natasha Henstridge, James Cromwell, George Dzunza, Marg Helgen6berger, in which scientists create a clone from the monster of the original film. And Species III, 2001 by Brad Turner with Robin Dunne, Robert Knepper and the gorgeous Sunny Mabrey.",Species
10,BA_Harrison,Spine-ripping alien sex schlock horror.,8,23 August 2007,"Any film featuring a creature designed by H.R. Giger has got to be worth a look, even more so if it also features plenty of nudity from hottie Natasha Henstridge and a decent cast including Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Ben Kingsley and Forest Whitaker.In Species, a female human/alien hybrid, created by meddling scientists (when will they ever learn?), escapes from a high-tech laboratory in order to procreate. With the fate of the human race at stake, a group of 'specialists' (some more scientists, an empath and a mercenary) are gathered together to try and trap the creature (named Sil) before she can successfully mate with a healthy male.As a popcorn flick, Species is a success, delivering plenty of thrills, some gratuitous nekkidness, and a touch of nice juicy gore. Towards the end of the film, like all good movie monsters, Sil heads for the sewers and here the plot becomes a bit strained (and the CGI effects a tad weak), but for the majority of the time, this sci-fi/horror is very entertaining. After all, this is pure schlock, albeit with a budget, and as such the story shouldn't be dissected too thoroughly.I had deducted one point from my rating due to a couple of ridiculous mechanical scares (a squirrel jumps onto one of the characters(!) and a tramp lurches from behind a dumpster), but reinstated it after hearing Molina deliver the immortal post-copulation line ""well, I enjoyed that immensely."" So it's a decent 8/10 from me for this unpretentious slice of scaly alien fun.",Species
11,Coventry,Sexy Natasha endangers the male species!,4,28 April 2006,"Ah finally! An excuse to stare at gorgeous boobs, cleverly disguised as Sci-Fi cinema! Well maybe that's a tad bit exaggerated but, still, the multiple sequences in which Natasha Henstridge walks around topless are unquestionably the most memorable moments of the entire movie. In her debut role, stunning Natasha plays a secret government project, namely the very first scientific hybrid of human and alien DNA. During the opening sequences, she's still a teenage girl but already incredibly strong and too dangerous to keep alive any longer. When project leader Fitch (Ben Kinsley) attempts to destroy her with gas, she escapes on a train and Michelle Williams transforms into Natasha Henstridge. What's the sole thing on a sexy blond alien's mind when she drifts through L.A. all by herself? Procreate, of course, and thus Sil (her codename) hooks up with random men as she's looking for the perfect sperm donor. Meanwhile, Fitch assembles an elite squad that'll be charged with hunting down Sil and annihilate her before she copulates the entire male population to death. ""Species"" is a pretty bad movie, yet horror and Sci-Fi fans will definitely find it entertaining due to its large amount of gore and trashy sleaze. The action-sequences are well illustrated and exciting but, as soon the script tries to be intellectual, the whole thing looks stupid and dreary. Especially the characters don't make much sense. Michael Madsen is (again) supposed to be a tough and merciless bounty hunter, but he has a gingerbread heart and falls for a dull female doctor. Kingsley is profiled to be the cold and heartless scientist but he can't even force his authority on a four-headed crew? Oh, and Forest Whitaker is the lousiest spiritual medium ever! ""Something has happened here"", he says whilst staring at the bloody aftermath inside the train carriage. Well duh! You're staring at corpse and the juicy leftovers of an alien cocoon! The special effects are blobby and they regularly brought back memories of cheap B-movies from the 80's, which was nice. Like I said, ""Species"" is a lot of fun as long as none of the characters open their mouths to speak.",Species

13,Theo Robertson,Deadly Dull And Cliched,4,28 July 2002,"***** CONTAINS SPOILERS ******SPECIES is an extremely dumb and derivative SF horror film . Not only that it`s extremely predictable  The plot is this : human egg is mixed with alien DNA which leads to the creation of an alien girl ,alien girl escapes and a bunch of spook types have to hunt her down because the future of humanity is at stake . Think of a medley megamix of A FOR ANDROMEDA , FRANKENSTEIN , THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT , LIFEFORCE , THE X FILES and a climax that rips off ALIEN and you`ve got the idea. Or should that be several other folks ideas ?Most of the actors try to do their best with their sketchily written characters , well apart from Michael Madsen who may very well be doing his best , but the more films I see him in the more obvious it becomes that Madsen lacks any range , and he plays a government hitman in SPECIES , oh gee hope I didn`t spoil anything for you there. Without doubt the best performance is by Michelle Williams who plays the young Sil and who manages to communicate the fear and suffering the hunted alien must be going through , such a pity she turns into a bimbo non actress .The one really bad thing about this film - with the exception of the dialogue - is the CGI , it really is bad in some places like the tendrils coming out of the young Sil`s face , and it never ever rises above being mediocre at best .Still despite its many flaws SPECIES is an absolute masterwork compared to the sequel",Species

Michael Madsen is pretty good as part of the team as are Marg Helgenberger and (especially) Forest Whitaker.

16,poolandrews,"""Lets just say I'm a freelance solution to some of our Governments problems."" Enjoyable mix of horror, Sci-Fi & female toplessness...",7,27 July 2005,"Species starts at 'U.S. Government Laboratories Dugway, Utah' where a young girl named Sil (Michelle Williams) has been created by altering human DNA by Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) & his team who are using a blueprint in a message sent by extra-terrestrial life from outer space. The decision has been made to terminate the experiment, that means Sil has to be killed which is an idea she isn't keen on so breaks out of the lab & disappear into the darkness of the night. Sil manges to make it to Los Angeles by train having now reached adulthood (Natasha Henstridge) where she becomes intent on completing her life cycle by reproducing & having a baby. Fitch assembles a team to find & kill Sil, a professional hit-man called Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen), a molecular biologist named Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger), Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker) an empath & finally Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina). Together they trace Sil to Los Angeles where they must find & stop Sil before she mates & infects the human race with the strain of deadly alien DNA...Directed by Roger Donaldson I thought Species was a good solid horror Sci-Fi film. Why does the IMDb list Species main genre as drama? Horror is the last one it lists when it should be the first. The script by Dennis Feldman moves along at a fair pace although I must admit my interest started to wain towards the end & there are some gaping plot holes that annoyed me. For instance why is it so hard for Sil to have sex? I'd have thought having the looks of Natasha Henstridge would mean she could have sex morning, noon & night if she wanted! I don't know about Los Angeles but where I live we'd be queueing up round the block! Also when she knows that Fitch & his team are after her why does she deliberately seek them out, even after she has faked her own death? Why attract the attention of the only people on Earth who know who she is & want to kill her? On a positive note Species provides good entertainment & Natasha Henstridge naked, what more do you want? With an estimated budget of $35,000,000 director Donaldson does an OK job but fails to create much tension or atmosphere, Species looks & feels rather bland & forgettable throughout. A sequence when Lennox & Baker are trapped in a isolation chamber with some mutant alien DNA falls particularly flat & is distinctly ineffective. The special effects are a mixed bag, some of the CGI Sil alien effects at the end are poor by todays high standards although the special make-up & creature effects look better. The alien Sil was designed by H.R. Giger complete with exaggerated red nipples one of which shoots out & acts like a tentacle isn't exactly a million miles away from the look of the alien from Alien (1979) which Giger also designed. There is some violence & gore here as Sil leaves behind a steady supply of bodies, a ripped out spine, tentacles bursting through the back of peoples heads & a chopped off thumb. The acting is OK by all involved although Kingsley isn't given that much to do, Madsen makes for a likable hero. The sequel Species II (1998) came three years after this & in my humble opinion is better. Species is definitely worth watching although I think it plays a little longish at times & I doubt I'll be sitting through it again anytime soon.",Species
17,Boba_Fett1138,It's already a cult-classic.,8,26 May 2008,"For some reason I've always loved watching ""Species"", even though I very well realize that it isn't a particularly good movie. Still due to its approach and handling of a really unoriginal concept and story, the movie can be regarded as one of the best science-fiction movies from the '90's.If you need to compare this movie to something, you can easily compare it to any of the ""Alien""-movies. Of course over the years ""Alien"" and its sequel ""Aliens"" have been ripped-off countless times and film-makers often tried to cash in by making basically ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" clones, using the same concept, settings, characters, locations, complete sequences and whatever more that it was that made these two science-fiction movies such an highly acclaimed success. Yes, in my opinion ""Species"" can definitely be seen as an ""Alien"" clone but out of all the movies that ever tried to rip off the ""Alien"" movies in any way possible, this is easily the best movie, that at times even makes you forget how unoriginal it actually truly is.Also no big wonder that the movie should remind you of ""Alien"" at times, also since the alien in this movie got designed by the same man who designed the original alien for ""Alien"" and all of its sequels. So perhaps this is also part of the reason why you so easily can forgive this movie from ripping off ""Alien"" in parts.It's a surprising movie from Roger Donaldson, who had never done any science-fiction or horror before and he also hasn't done any ever since. Donaldson is these days mostly known for directing more serious movies.It's perhaps its horror that also makes this movie work out so well. The movie is not just a science-fiction movie about an alien on the loose but truly knows to create a dark moody atmosphere as well and puts in a couple of true great and effective horror moments, which makes the movie tense and in a way also unpredictable to watch, also since the movie is not too afraid to kill off its main characters.There is also some gore in the movie that is good looking, with its often graphic killings. Also the make-up effects are great and the movie uses some early special effects, that especially for 1995 standards seem like pretty good ones, even though the movie itself somewhat feels and looks like a low budget production.The movie makes a choice not to only follow the team that is called in to hunt down the alien but also shows things from the perspective of the alien herself. She's constantly learning things, which she uses to adapt and blend in and to eventually get what she wants. This approach gives ""Species"" a nice extra dimension. It's like ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", only with a not so friendly alien. The movie also has an amazing cast with actors such as Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker and Michelle Williams involved. Whenever I hear the name- or a thinking of Ben Kingsley, I'm not thinking about ""Schindler's List"" or ""Ghandi"" but I'm thinking about ""Species"". I don't now, I just find it to be a very amusing role by him, despite the fact that he plays his character totally death serious.I love this movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Species
18,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,She'll kill anyone who gets in her way,6,7 November 2010,"When a lab experiment goes awry, two doctors, an Empath and a man who excels at killing are sent to retrieve the escaped specimen. She has the appearance of a normal woman, but Sil has half the DNA of an extra-terrestrial(I know, when *will* those eggheads learn?), and we don't know her limitations. One thing is for sure. She wants to mate. While this cheesy little sci-fi horror flick(reminiscent of those from the 50's) is silly and clichéd, it is also surprisingly engaging, and effort was put into making the script hold up... unusual for this sub-genre. We get a great and talented cast, and they deliver fairly good performances. Madsen is cool, Kingsley is determined, and Whitaker is hypersensitive. All three do well. This is downright creepy and scary, with tension, several nice jumps and some truly grotesque sights and sounds. The creature is built up well, with a chilling design(and who could forget the ""nightmare train sequence""?) courtesy of H.R. Giger, famous for ""fathering"" the Alien for Ridley Scott's classic. This has reasonably solid production values(even if one explosion seems to get turned into three with the use of cheap zooming in), with great practical FX. The CGI is dated, and perhaps it wasn't impressive to begin with. This is genuinely funny. The concept isn't bad. And this was the first role for the incredibly stunning Natasha Henstridge. What she may lack in skill she more than makes up for in willingness to strip in front of the camera and appearance. She's naked for half her screen-time! This is pretty exploitative, as you may have guessed. We get plenty of bloody, gory violence, nudity and sex, several hot chicks and a bit of strong language. The DVD comes with a trailer for this and its direct sequel. I recommend this to any fan of this type of movie. 6/10",Species
19,view_and_review,Solid Start to a Franchise,6,30 August 2020,"A government project called S.E.T.I. (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) made contact with something extraterrestrial. Whatever it was beamed a DNA sequence to the SETI team who then fertilized a human egg with that DNA sequence. I know. Dumb. But at least we got a movie out of it. The result was a part human, part alien female named Sil that grew at an accelerated rate. When she broke containment the project leader, Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley), hired a team to capture and/or kill her. He contracted an empath (Forest Whitaker), an assassin (Michael Madsen), a professor in cross-cultural behavior (Alfred Molina), and a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger).I would call ""Species"" a cross between ""Alien"" and ""Jurassic Park"" (since we're combining things). The species, which quickly became a gorgeous adult (Natasha Henstridge), was nearly as deadly as the xenomorphs in ""Alien"" (and sort of looked like one) and was a DNA amalgamation like the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park."" So, she could be as unassuming and harmless as a beautiful blond can be, yet as ferocious and deadly as a xenomorph.""Species"" was decent. It had a couple of ""you idiot"" moments, but nothing egregious. I think this movie was a fine start to a horror/thriller movie franchise.",Species

Unfortunately, she escapes and within just a matter of days has attained full adulthood.

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that Natasha Henstridge was perfectly cast as the beautiful but psychopathic creature named ""Sil"". I also liked the performance of Forest Whitaker (who played the empath by the name of ""Dan Smithson"") and Marg Helgenberger (as the micro-biologist named ""Dr. Laura Baker"").

It features a breed of alien that dines on people and looks exactly like Natasha Henstridge. With that respect she ages rapidly until reaching the Henstridge stage. She escapes from a lab that was to abort her and she stalks about in search of eager males and breeding, which leads to a nasty sexual encounters that are deadlier than any sexually transmitted disease. Perhaps she should get a guest spot on The Dating Game to help her chances. Lousy recycled peep show reduced to formula and predictable stupidity. Directed by Roger Donaldson who previously made The Bounty, and whose best asset is the special effects. Henstridge spends most of the film having nasty sex and displaying a look on her face that indicates that her underwear might be jammed up her crack. File in as the morons who test death are Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Forest Whitaker, and Marg Helgenberger whose roles are reduced too running and either dying or narrowly avoiding it. One thing is for sure, and that is they didn't narrowly avoid the casting call for this trash.

The action-movie focus during the latter half results in some fine moments, as they chase her around town leading to scenes like the freeway chase into the hillside or the spectacular series of stalking and shoot-outs in the underground caves at the finale, among other top choices. The underground scenes in particular are among the film's best parts, as the disorienting caves, dark pits and waterways provide some great locations to generate some amazing shootouts and spectacle amongst it all. Other big action scenes are spread throughout the film and really help mask the fact that this is slightly too long, it's only big flaw, since there's several subplots that last too long or don't need to be included at all. Fortunately, the marvelous special effects for the alien being, abundant gore in the graphic kills and copious nudity also manage to overcome the film's rather weak CGI for the finale, and with enough tension and suspense from the main, make this one rather entertaining.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and animal violence",Species

26,Aaron1375,Good actors turn this cheesy science fiction horror film into a fun ride.,8,10 December 2009,"This film has a rather low score here, but I thought it was a rather good science fiction/horror movie that also has good action and comedy too. Scientist have created a new form of life based on some strange signals received from outer space. Though at the beginning of movie they are trying to kill this life as I do believe they have figured out that his new life is a threat to the human race. They get a group of scientist, a psychic and a guy who takes care of things a great character played very well by Michael Madsen. He really added something to this movie and I really enjoyed his character. Natasha also is very good in this movie as the very sexy and sultry alien who is out to find herself a mate. The story is somewhat cheesy, but it is still fun thanks to the good actors in this movie who include besides Madsen and Natasha Forest Whitaker, Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina. The alien is a bit different too, as it is not a seemingly bad creature, only doing what her instincts direct her to do. She is not a kill first creature though bad things will happen if she is allowed to mate and bring about more of her species. There are also some very memorable scenes in this one, the most memorable being the one involving the guy with asthma and that wonderful kiss he shares with Natasha. A lot better movie to me than a lot of horror movies here that get a lot higher scores than they deserve, I think this one deserves higher, but I would never want to watch the sequels as they did not look good at all from the previews I saw.",Species
27,Wuchakk,"Wiping out the ""galactic weed""",8,5 November 2015,"Released in 1995, ""Species"" chronicles events after SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) receives a transmission from outer space detailing alien DNA structure, along with instructions on how to splice it with human DNA. This gives birth to Sil, a girl (Michele Williams) who escapes and rapidly grows into a statuesque blonde (Natasha Henstridge). Government agent Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) assembles a team to locate and destroy Sil before she finds a mate and breeds. The team includes a tough mercenary (Michael Madsen), an anthropologist (Alfred Molina), a molecular biologist (Marg Helgenberger) and an empath (Forest Whitaker).I developed a bad attitude toward ""Species"" for years due to Roger Ebert's scathing review, but changed my mind upon giving it an openminded viewing. This is a top-of-the-line sci-fi/adventure/horror flick. People look down on it because of the nudity and mild sex scenes, which prompts them to disdain it as exploitive and trashy. While Natasha Henstridge is a good-lookin' woman, she doesn't do anything for me (she's not my type) so I was able to totally overlook this element and focus on the film's other attributes.For one, the score by Christopher Young is excellent. Secondly, the A-list cast is a highlight and their characters are increasingly fleshed-out in the story. Lastly, while people understandably write-off the movie as a Grade B plot with Grade A production, there's more here than meets the eye. For instance, Sil is the innocent pawn of the extraterrestrials who sent the DNA. Another example is the excellent character of Dan (Whitaker) whom whiners complain about as ""always pointing out the obvious"" when the movie shows over and over that he DOES know things the others don't and they ignore him to their own peril. Dan is necessary so that the team knows what direction the creature takes on repeated occasions; without Dan we'd see them pursue one boring dead-end after another.While snobby film critics love to hate ""Species"" it's a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi adventure with an interesting moral and a great cast of characters. If you like films like ""Alien,"" ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Predator"" you'll probably appreciate it. It may not be as good as ""Aliens,"" ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2,"" but it's on par with ""Alien"" (and marginally better IMHO) and superior to ""Predator."" Then again, it depends on what you want in a sci-fi blockbuster. As far as I'm concerned, ""Species"" delivers the goods.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in the areas of Los Angeles and Brigham City, Utah.GRADE: A-***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie)The theory is postulated by the mercenary and biologist that the alien DNA was sent as a biological weapon, a ""weed killer"" from outer space to wipe out the galactic weed of earth or, more accurately, the human race that inhabits it. It's a fascinating concept and the film compellingly realizes it.",Species
28,The_Void,"Sexy B-movie thriller, great fun!",7,10 July 2006,"Species is like a meeting between an amateur low budget film, and a big budget horror movie. On the one hand; the film has a great cast and is professionally produced, but on the other - the special effects wouldn't have looked out of place in an eighties film, and the plot concentrates mostly on its sleazy and often silly by-products. That being said, however, the movie is lots of fun; and overall I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the best horror films of the nineties. The film takes obvious influence from a range of similar films, such as Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce and Jack Sholder's 'The Hidden', but it brings all of it's elements together well and somehow manages to feel fresh and inventive. The plot is pure hokum, but it works well; as alien-human crossover 'Sil' escapes from a testing lab with a team of professionals, comprising a psychic, an action hero, a woman etc, on her tail. Sil's ultimate goal is to reproduce, and to complete that aim she must find a man. So basically, what we have here is a sexy, horny, naked chick being chased around before she can have sex with someone. Sounds good to me...I'm not quite sure how director Roger Donaldson managed it, but he's managed to get quite a few names to appear in his film; and most of them do well with their roles. Despite the fact that she probably isn't really, Natasha Henstridge looks clean and pure in the lead role; and this both ensures that she looks the part, and the film is great in that it carries off the juxtaposition of having a sweet-looking virginal woman act like a prostitute. Ben Kingsley is the biggest cast surprise, as the former Ghandi actor looks slightly out of place in a B-movie like this. Michael Madsen is absolutely great in his typecast action hero role and the cast is completed by a memorable performance from Alfred Molina, and a rather annoying one from Forest Whitaker. Marg Helgenberger fails to make much of an impression as Madsen's love interest. The two plots that run concurrently are played out well, and climax nicely. The special effects are key in a film like this, and even though they're cheap throughout - they do look fairly realistic. It's not until we get to the end and the director decides to spoil it with some abysmal CGI that the effects become a problem. But even so, Species takes its plot well and isn't too serious, and I've got to rate this as a really fun flick overall.",Species

There is plenty of blood and guts and very romantic scenes which usually wind up in a blood bath death.

( the Search for Extra Terrestrial Life ), a team of scientists, headed by Fitch ( Ben Kingsley ) have picked up strange signals from outer space that appear to be a genetic code. The code is then used to create a human being - a young girl whom they christen 'Sil' ( Michelle Williams ). She is too powerful for them to control, and they try to kill her. Sil breaks out and, evolving into adult form ( Natasha Henstridge ), steals a train conductor's clothes and money. While they endeavor to track her down, the alien girl embarks on a blood-soaked quest for a mate...In 1960, the B.B.C. broadcast 'A For Andromeda', a six-part sci-fi serial by Fred Hoyle and John Eliot, which starred the then-unknown Julie Christie. It also concerned a beautiful young woman created by scientists from information sent from space. 'Species' owes it a great debt, as well as to the 1990's revival of 'The Outer Limits' and 'V' especially the character of Elisabeth the star child. Nudity abounds, but with Henstridge providing it who's complaining? The 'yuck' factor is high too, especially in the scene when the chrysalis in the train compartment spits out the adult Sil. 'Alien' creator H.R.Giger designed Sil's true alien form and, as you'd expect, its gross.Yes, this is a daft movie - sleazy and illogical by turns - but thoroughly enjoyable. Quality actors such as Kingsley and Alfred Molina give it a bit of a lift.

33,sddavis63,It Has Its Moments,5,10 January 2013,"As this movie came to an end, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) asked a question that I thought was surprisingly thought provoking, given that the movie as a whole wasn't especially thought provoking. According to the story, several years before, SETI (The Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) had received a signal from an alien civilization. They interpreted it as having been a friendly signal sent in response to signals from earth. The signal included an alien DNA code, in response to a human DNA code that had been sent into space. The scientists decided to implant the alien DNA into a human ovum to make an alien- human hybrid creature. OK. (I suppose the opening is thought provoking as well, in depicting this poor, human looking young girl locked in what was little more than a comfortable cage with little contact with anyone, but it was the ending quote I found most thought provoking - from Dr. Baker: ""she was half us and half something else. I wonder what half was the predatory half?"" Good question! (Maybe the aliens tried the same experiment with our DNA with equally disastrous results and were trying to get back at us!)You see, this hybrid was predatory. It was a killer. It grew rapidly, reached maturity quickly and had the desire to mate and reproduce and would do whatever it took to find the right partner. If that included killing, so be it. But, yeah, from what we were told, the aliens seemed friendly enough. So where did the predatory half come from? Us? Interesting, and thought-provoking enough that it actually made me raise my estimation of the movie just a bit.Having said, that, this is overall not a great movie. It has some moments. No doubt about that. Some of the animation - revolving around the alien in the underground caverns near the end of the movie - was pretty primitive looking, though. There was really no need for Dr. Baker and Preston (Michael Madsen) to get together romantically, and Forrest Whitaker's character of the empath Dan seemed really out of place. In fact, the movie seemed to reach its silliest pretty early on when Xavier (Ben Kingsley) gathered this team who had been brought together to search out and destroy the creature, looked at Preston (who was some sort of special ops/government hit man type) and said to him ""as the non-scientist among us ..."" ""THE"" non-scientist? Are we to infer that Xavier considered an empath to be a scientist? Pretty silly line. One line, yes, but it stuck in my head for some reason. Anyway.The cast here is a very interesting one. It ranges from the very well known and accomplished Ben Kingsley to the (at the time) unknown and not at all accomplished Natasha Henstridge, who has never really built a major acting career out of this beginning. She's quite beautiful, but she didn't really blow me away. (As an aside, when I lived for a few years in Newfoundland, I lived near her home town of Springdale and actually knew a couple of people who were related to her and some who knew her as a child when the family would return home to visit after moving away. I actually was living there when this movie was released, so it created quite a buzz that one of Newfoundland's own was starring in a movie!) Between Kingsley and Henstridge, there were other faces, some (like Whitaker or Alfred Molina) better known (to me anyway) than others (such as Madsen or Helgenberger.) So there was quite a range of talent and experience in this. Kingsley's character looked a bit silly in the end as he picked up the flame thrower to go after the creature. I still see him as Ghandi, I guess, and Ghandi with a flame thrower is not an image my brain can process easily! In fact, at various times scattered throughout this I picked up an almost tongue in cheek attitude in the movie.This isn't great but it also isn't really bad, and, yes, it does have its moments.

And, for an out and out B-movie, Species has to be up there with the best of them.There is nothing particularly 'stand-out' about anything in it. An alien – or rather the most ATTRACTIVE alien you've ever seen – is unleashed on an unwitting L.A. population and we follow the rag-tag bunch charged with the task of tracking her down before she reproduces (and, if you're interested, the 'reproducing scenes' are worth watching this film from most red-blooded males' points of view!).Absolutely nothing new to see, just a hell of a load of cheesy fun that, albeit quite serious, never gets heavy enough to drag the film down into a melodrama. It just manages to stay slightly above 'tongue-in-cheek' to allow everyone (and when I say 'everyone' I probably just mean men) to enjoy the crazy, corpse-strewn ride.There are plenty of memorable moments, but most of those involve a nude woman.

These are probably the film's highlight. And if you enjoy female nudity, you'll find more than your share here. The beautiful newcomer, Natasha Henstridge, is displayed in all her glory. She is very well cast as the alien, Sil, though, and not just a pretty face. She does have talent (erm...acting talent...).The film features a seasoned cast, but unfortunately the script is laden with issues and not very intelligent either. Forest Whitaker's character, Dan, was mostly annoying with silly dialogue, always stating the obvious. In one scene they enter a train compartment with blood and body parts everywhere and he remarks ""Something bad happened here."" Later in the film he also insists ""she went this way"", when in fact she didn't.... pfff!!! So much for being Clairsentient!

Giger designed the creature), the cast which includes heavyweights like Ben Kingley, Forrest Whitaker, Alfred Molina(SOOO young here) as well as always fun to watch Michael Madsen and beauties Marge Helgenberger, newcomer Natasha Henstridge and a very young Michelle Willimas, a decent script, very workmanlike directing from Roger Donaldson(who generally does a good job creating suspense and action). All of these add up for a roller-coaster THAT did keep me on the edge of my seat. I cared about the characters, the story was inventive, and the acting was very good for a vehicle like this. Are there some big holes in the script? You betcha! Are some of the lines and the ending in particular a bit troublesome to swallow? Yes, again, but I liked the movie nonetheless. Kinglsey is very good in his role as a bureaucrat. Whitaker excels as an empath. Henstridge is absolutely stunning and very fresh. This is your typical government makes-a-mistake-then-gathers-a-group-of-experts film, but one that I thought was very well done and highly entertaining.",Species
40,Anonymous_Maxine,"Wow, Natasha Henstridge was literally born naked into the movies.",6,7 December 2004,"Species starts out with a great premise. Scientists receive radio signals from outer space that, when decoded, include an alien form of DNA and instructions for combining it with human DNA, resulting in attractive human creatures that have attributes of the alien species. In the opening scene of the movie, scientists are trying to gas a cute little blonde girl to death, having learned that this particular alien species is far more than we can handle and, my god, making it female didn't make it more docile and controllable after all. I find the beginning premise fascinating to no end, but probably because I always forget that such story lines are dreamed up by people who have no more clue about what's out there than I do, so I'm probably not going to learn anything. That's why movies like this tend to go downhill in the second half.One of the most startling characteristics of this new species is its rapid growth rate. The subject has grown to the size and appearance of a 10-year-old girl after only a few days, and then before long into the statuesque form of Natasha Henstridge not long after. At this point, still well within the confines of the first act, it may become apparent that, if she has grown to maturity almost immediately, you might think she would grow into an old woman and die of old age before the week is out. Later in the movie you may also wonder how a few cells can grow into a bubbling mass of organic matter before the very eyes of shocked and frightened scientists with no nourishment whatsoever. What is being metabolized to allow it to grow like that?No matter. It's strange that the movie started off with such an interesting premise, a radio signal from a clearly intelligent alien species, and then all of a sudden we realize that that intelligent species is nothing but another slimy Hollywood alien. Try to imagine this alien, in its own form, sitting down to compose a radio signal including instructions for how to combine two types of DNA, and you have the chink in this movie's already thin armor. Forest Whitaker is great as the movie's resident psychic, I don't know why, he just fits roles like that really well. He's got one of those faces that always seems to be deep in thought, and is clearly not someone who easily fits in with the mainstream. He's very good at conveying emotion, from extreme sadness to gleeful happiness, and interestingly one of his best scenes is one in which he's drunk. Alfred Molina is also very good as the anthropologist, a very different role from the one he may now be better known for in Spiderman 2. There is a young actor named Michelle Williams who gives a wonderful performance as Sil, the human form of the alien, as a young girl, effectively portraying her fear of her sterile surroundings. Once she turns into the blonde bombshell that is Natasha Henstridge, the majority of the rest of the film is concerned with her burning desire to mate and create babies and with everyone else's growing desire to stop her before they lose containment even more completely. One thing that I found interesting about the movie was the locations. It was filmed mostly on location in Hollywood and the Santa Monica area, which is where I live, so it was interesting to see all of these street locations that I know so well. I found it a bit odd, though, that in one scene Michael Madsen's character reads Dr. Baker's (his romantic interest in the film) home address, which is a real address in Simi Valley. My grandparents live in Simi Valley, and over the Thanksgiving holiday this year I decided to ride my bike by the house that was mentioned in the movie. It's just some house, in case you were wondering, but the address is real.There are some strange scenes in the movie, such as the one where they find the crashed car that Sil was in, find the tip of one of her thumbs in the car, and assume that she's dead. What do they figure happened to the rest of her body? Vaporized? There is some great poetic justice, you might say, in her choice of a mate, but my favorite part of the movie was the part at the end when the woman wonders which half of Sil, the human or the alien, was the predatory half. Pretty interesting question about humanity, although a bit jarring to have come from what is at best a second rate science fiction film.",Species

Not nearly as good though...",6,23 February 2019,"This is definitely a B-movie, although a great one. Why? Because originally this movie was meant to be taken seriously and they put lots of effort in it to make it look good. Great actors, for one. They truly act ok, how could it be otherwise with the magnificent talents of Ben Kingsley, Forest Whitaker and Michael Madsen. These are A list actors, oscar winners. The photography and music score are what one could expect from any other great scifi picture as well. Beautiful suspensful music score and great photography. Yet the story is quite ridiculous. No, good acting or horrifying special effects can cover up the bad taste of this ridiculous story.The story starts out ok though. At the beginning this movie is really rather enjoyable, with a surprising teenage role by (then unknown) Michelle Williams as an artificially created Alien. The alien escapes and starts trying to breed with men. This is the really raunchy part, wherein we see the gorgeous blonde alien in hot nude scenes contineously. Quite sexy, yet from here on the story gets rather silly as well.Nevertheless, despite this silly story, if you have never seen this movie, it will definitely put a grin on the face of many men, who surely can dig a blonde alien, looking like Natasha Hensdrigde. There are quite enough shocking action scenes to be enjoyed as well, BUT please dont expect more than a good (raunchy) B-movie.H.R. Giger, the creator of the monsters in the all time scifi classic ""Alien"" (1978), has made the monster in this movie as well. In this movie the monster looks laughable though, but the monsters in ""Alien"" (1978) will scare the living daylihgts out of you. Be sure to check that 1978 ""Alien"" classic out.

And though she's not given much to do save for walk around in various states of undress, Henstridge does a reasonably good job as both a curious blank slate and a deadly black widow predator.

Finch is a scientist, who feels the hybrid is too dangerous for the human race. But Sil escapes from her observation room.

The cast seems to be having an great time expect for Kingsley, who seems... he taken his role way too seriously and he is stuck with the worse kind of dialogue since the unintentionally funny Tobe Hooper's film ""Lifeforce"". Which ""Species"" is occasionally dumb, when it is intentionally. But the highlight is Henstridge and of course, H.R. Giger (Alien). Despite mixed reviews, ""Species"" was an box office success and later... three sequels were produced.The single disc from the 2004 edition. The DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong DTS 5.1 Surround Sound (also in Dolby Digital 5.1). DVD extras have two informative commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director and actors:Henstridge & Madsen. Commentary two is by the director, producer Frank Mancuso Jr., visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund and special make-up effects creator Steve Johnson. DVD also includes the original theatrical trailer, sneak peak at the awful ""Species 3"" and more. ""Species"" went on to have a cult following for over the years.

48,ShootingShark,Enjoyably Scary Sci-Fi/Action/Horror Yarn Of Escaped Alien Seeking A Mate,6,2 August 2011,"A secret US government lab receives a transmission from space of a coded DNA strand and grows a female alien, which it names Sil. Sil's growth rate is fantastic, and when the nervous eggheads try to terminate her, she escapes and makes it to Los Angeles. A team comprising the head boffin, an assassin, an empath, a biologist and an anthropologist are scrambled to track her down before she can reproduce I really like this movie, but then I'm a sucker for this type of material - it's got mystery, action, clandestine operations, sex, scares, gruesome special effects, intriguing characters and most important of all, a terrific and quite original monster. It may be an Alien knock-off but it has more than enough variety in its premise and depth to the people to justify itself. Sil is a fascinating protagonist as she is forced into a desperate situation, must use all her predatory instincts to survive but also has to confront who she is and the point of her existence. Henstridge is terrific in her debut role, wisely keeping Sil's dialogue pared down but still exploiting the pathos of her monster, not to mention handling the frequent nudity and action scenes with aplomb. The team of experts are a great bunch of character actors, with Madsen the quintessential tough guy, Molina a great comic foil who meets a gleefully sticky end, and best of all Whitaker in another great twitchy oddball part as the guy who can sense people's feelings. I must admit I think this film has a liability though, and it's the third act. For ninety minutes it moves admirably fast, setting up and exploring the story and the character dynamics without any chaff and moving logically on with the chase. The finale though, as our heroes hunt an impregnated Sil through a gloomy sewer system with guns and flamethrowers and all decide to wander off in different directions is much too familiar from every other such picture, starting with Them! forty years earlier. Donaldson's touch slips a little here and this sequence lacks focus and suspense, so for me the movie fizzles out a little. Nevertheless, it's still great science-fiction / action fun, with brilliant special effects by Richard Edlund and Steve Johnson, and horror music fans should savour another fantastic choral string score by Christopher Young. Extremely well scripted by Dennis Feldman, who also wrote The Golden Child and the delightfully crazy Real Men. Whilst not in the top drawer of alien monster movies this is a fun flick, and would make a great double-bill with Tobe Hooper's Lifeforce, which also features a sexy young woman out to destroy the world.",Species
49,Spleen,Let's split up!,3,11 July 1999,"Well, no, they don't actually use those words, but their attempt to disguise the idiocy of splitting up in the middle of a monster-haunted maze is even more embarrassing.That's the biggest particular idiocy.  It's harder to determine the second biggest idiocy - there's more competition - but my preferred candidate is the scene where the scientists (so called) decide to put some alien DNA in a test tube with a few millilitres of some liquid or other in order to see what happens.  Nothing happens.  -No, that's what would have happened if I'd been director.  Actually, within seconds, they have a giant brown squid that threatens to overwhelm the world.  What was the giant squid made out of? Where did all the matter come from?  (And given its casual lack of concern for laws of physics and biochemistry, why was it so unscary?)""Species"" is rife with such idiocies and clumsily made to boot.  I'll admit that Natasha Henstridge's body is worth seeing; but even here there are problems.  For one thing, if we're going to see her naked so often, then I'd rather she were the heroine.  It's as if the director thought that sexiness is a kind of cinematic sin, which can be atoned for only by violence and angst.  I feel quite strongly about this matter.  Casual, jeu d'esprit erotica I have no quarrel with.  The Hollywood idea that sex and nudity belong in the dark, with a false air of dead seriousness and the hypocritical pretence that some deep dramatic end is being served, I do have a quarrel with.

The ""anti-Jaws"" approach of showing the monster off is really cool as the premise is largely how detailed and dangerous the xenos is, but the approach removes a lot of the suspense in the hunting and subterfuge, almost humanizing her as ""hunted by the evil government entity"".While it would be a much different, and arguably better, movie to do something more like ""The Thing"", that she only has one human mask sorts of outs her, making it more like a spy movie, and I think they did really well with that in mind.It just lacks the level of nuance and hidden information that spy and thriller movies tend to have.It's much closer to ""Aliens"" than ""Alien"".",Species

56,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Species""- Delicious 90's cheese. A silly, sexy sci-fi thriller that doesn't really hold up, but is fun to watch regardless.",6,16 June 2018,"I remember back around '95 when director Roger Donaldson's ""Species"" first hit the public's attention. It was built up as the sort-of ultimate ""modern"" science fiction film- with buckets of gore, cutting edge computer effects... and of course, its notorious use of a ""sexy alien villain"" whom is seeking to mate. It was supposed to be a new classic- an erotic thriller like no other. And indeed, the film was generally well-liked for the most part. At least at the time. Heck, I even remember many of my extended family members renting the film over and over again when it first came out on VHS. Of course I was too young to see the film at the time... but I was definitely aware of its cultural impact.But alas, as is all too often the case, the 90's struck again. Yes, in retrospect, ""Species"" is one of those many films that was popular at the time... but has been showing its age exponentially as time goes on. It's hard to take it seriously now with its simplistic writing and laughable effects. And yet, a part of me does still definitely have a little love for this weird, uneven film. It's cheesy and antiquated and doesn't really hold up. But what can I say? With bouncing naked bodies, creative kills and some decent performances, it's still quite a bit of fun to watch.A seedy government agent (Ben Kingsley) has used a decoded extraterrestrial signal to create something entirely unexpected- an alien-human hybrid. However, when the surviving test subject ""Sil"" manages to escape in a violent breakout, a rag-tag team (Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker) is assembled to track her down at any cost. Trouble is, the alien DNA has accelerated Sil's growth, causing her to mature into a fully-grown adult (Natasha Henstridge) in mere days. And her biological clock is starting to tick...Part of the charm of the film is that the cast is quite varied and talented. Though Natasha Henstridge was definitely cast more for her looks than her chops, she's pretty decent in the role of Sil, and makes for an adequately menacing presence. She's odd and aloof, and plays the part of an alien trying to blend in pretty decently. But the real highlights here are definitely Madsen, Helgenberger and Kingsley. Madsen plays it cool and sleek as he oft does in these types of roles, but for his part- that of a mysterious operative- it works very well. Helgenberger is charming and fun as a biologist whom helps study Sil. And Kingsley looks like he's having a blast and a half as a smarmy government stooge. Molina and Whitaker are also pretty darned good, adding a sense of class to the film, and it's fun to see them in an earlier film now that they've both gained great fame.And for the most part, the general production is fantastic. Director Donaldson does just about everything he can with the material, and there's a number of shockingly effective sequences. His sense of flow, composition and pacing is top-notch. I also very much adored the work of creature designer H.R. Giger. Giger, whom also famously designed the titular baddie from the original ""Alien,"" crafts a new fiendish monster for the ages in Sil- a beautiful and deadly seductress. It has all of Giger's trademarks, and is stunning to behold on-screen- especially with the amazing practical effects and puppetry. When it goes old-school, the effects are just mind-warping. And the gory kills are among the decade's best!But it's sadly not all sunshine and roses. And there are some big flaws that are impossible to ignore here. The film was definitely the product of its time, and it just doesn't up under modern scrutiny. Not only are the plethora of digital effects wonky and overly artificial, but the script by Dennis Feldman also leaves much to be desired. It feels a bit contrived and quaint looking back, and it's hard to take it seriously as a result. I also do take issue with how the film's most notorious facet- the sexuality- was handled. Don't get me wrong, I genuinely like the idea here. And it's safe to say that erotic thrillers can be masterful and the use of sex can add a lot to a film. But it comes off as a bit too skeevy here. It feels like nothing more than an excuse to show off the actress' ""assets"" and film some softcore ""skinemax"" material. And yet at the same time, it also feels oddly tame in many ways because it's basically only focused on bared breasts and brief simulated sex scenes. There just isn't much balance to it. Using sex and sex appeal in a film is a fine line. And ""Species"", well... it just doesn't quite stay on the line. It either needed to be more restrained... or it needed to go much further.Also... the jump-scares. They're so bad. Like seriously. This film has the single most laughable attempt at a jump I've ever seen, in a sequence involving a squirrel. It makes the ""Oh, it was just a cat"" jump-scare cliché look tame by comparison.In the end, it comes down to this. ""Species"" has a troubled script, dated effects and a some really lame attempts at scares. But it benefits from a fun premise, a groovy creature and a handful of great performances. So it comes down to how much you're willing to forgive. Me? I liked it despite its faults, because what it does well... it does really well. And so, I'm giving it an about-average 6 out of 10. If you love your delicious 90's cheese, it's definitely one to check out! Just don't expect too much out of it.",Species

Not able to resist such juicy stuff, scientist Ben Kingsley (as wooden as you'll ever see him) follows the recipe and lo and behold a beautiful monster is reared. And escapes. Naturally.So far so cute. She leaps over fences and crashes through windows and grows from pre- adolescent Michelle Williams to fully ovulating adult Natasha Henstride in days. She has one thing on her mind: reproduction. Anything that gets in her way she kills. She can give a mean tongue kiss that goes out through the back of your head should she feel threatened.Well, if this is a metaphor for the urgency of the feminine reproductive imperative I think they should have played the Power Station (?) song with the lyric, ""She wants to multiple/Are you gonna do it?"" in the background.Anyway, as usual the plot deteriorates into a drawn-out chase scene that Hollywood thinks the mass mind craves along with the usual stupidities.

Giger - the alien species, not the knockers - a half-human, half-alien life form called Sil (Natasha Henstridge in her human form) escapes from a SETI facility and goes on a rampage screwing everyone. In the Biblical sense. And then screwing them in the Hollywood sense.Spreading her alien seed, doing what every species on Earth has been designed to do by genetic engineering since life began, somehow she is regarded as doing something wrong. Only because she is not of the human species.And it only confuses the issue when non-humans have such great knockers.Specialists are called in to hunt down the alien: Michael Madsen as the Tough Guy, Alfred Molina as The Dork, Marg Helgenberger as The Hot Scientist and Forest Whitaker as The Empath, all led by Ben Kingsley The Brain.SPECIES hangs our credibility by a thread by initially mating human DNA with alien material to spawn Sil, but we can live with that in a haze of scientific jargon; that thread is cut when The Empath is introduced, tracking mud all over the science and jerking all over the jargon. Whitaker is only here so that the alien hunters can glean clues to Sil's movements without hard evidence and stay hot on her hot tail. That spoils an otherwise good story centered around the most basic tenet of natural selection.Sex.The message at the core of SPECIES is that every living thing's purpose is to mate; continuance for the genetic code. It's what Marg Helgenberger aches to do with Michael Madsen all movie.We've grown so inured to that mating message with all our displacement and duplicity and political correctness that when Sil asks a captive woman why she is here on Earth, the woman tearfully laments, ""I don't know!"" And people don't! They think they are here to make money, to worship false gods, to get married, work a job, buy a house, blah blah...Writer Dennis Feldman got it right - the purpose of life is to propagate more life. And the organism in this story trying to copulate copiously is designed correctly as well - she is the most alluring thing on two gams. Genetic engineering at its best. Henstridge is so strikingly beautiful, there is nothing else on screen when she glides past. Helgenberger is a tasty specimen herself, but in this movie, Henstridge is in a league of her own.The message gets a little lost when the person on the team who eventually has mind-blowing, unprotected sex with Sil is The Dork.

Species' also and far less significantly one of the better sci-fi action-thrillers too attributed to the terrific cast, dedicated story writing, awesome nostalgic science fiction theme, its all-around inexplicable sexiness, and primarily for the beautifully touching alien character played by Natasha who is no evil monster at all but a true innocent. In a movie loaded with established performers, Kingsley, Madsen, Whitaker, Molina, Helgenberger and a young beautiful Michelle Williams, Henstridge by far gives the best and the overall most impressive performance and it's not even close. Anybody who thinks differently, I think not. I love Species; Natasha is the main attraction, but Sil staying one step ahead of the team of scientists trying to hunt her down is entirely interesting stuff. They don't make 'em like this anymore!",Species
61,rzajac,Sure it's dated and outclassed... but it has its glories,7,31 December 2016,"Pretty much B-movie territory... but like I said it has its moments of real class.As the adult S1L works out her destiny, there are times you feel like you're seeing the kinds of primitive psychological insights into an idealized character, such as you'd get from Philip K. Dick or Jerome Bixby. I found those flashes refreshing and exciting. I also sometimes found myself gripped by the central existential issue: That the fate of the human race rests on the outcome, no less than in the original ""Alien"".But, yes, these rather pristine story elements wind up a bit inundated by the succession of de rigeur horror flick alien/human encounters.And there is the fact that one of the most interesting plot points is a tech hubris of ginormous proportions (NO SPOILER: It's revealed in the first 10 minutes): WHO the HECK's Bright Idea was it to shotgun a DNA sequence radioed from outer space into a human egg?!?!?! Sheesh!!!So, with the proviso that it's pretty much a horror movie snack, it's worth watching for the aforementioned sterling conceptual stings, the general decent production values, the nicely turned dramatic tension over the outcome, and almost all of the acting. There are some letdowns, but I still consider this a not-half-bad ""period"" classic of the genre.",Species
62,Squonkamatic,Amusing Alien Sleaze,6,15 August 2009,"Let's face it, SPECIES is a B movie with an A list cast & production design to match. It's a deceptive entertainment that finally shows it's hand during the boring, silly showdown in the sewer level from Quake II where you have to find the red key & beat the boss monster without the quad damage. I'd always drown before I could find the biosuit. Why this was never made into an adults oriented video game is beyond me, other than the obvious problem with marketing it to teenagers.The whole SPECIES franchise was meant to cash in on the success of the ALIEN films, obviously, and go straight for the amniotic fluid in the reproductive cycle at the expense of logic, probability, and science. It's probably a better movie than it had to be and I'm sure that multiple viewings will bring out more nuances, though that's probably not the idea they had in mind when making it. Once will suffice for most viewers.I enjoyed seeing Natasha Henstridge naked, however, and the H.R. Giger creature designs are fabulous as always. In fact I wondered, is the whole film really a contrivance just to get to see Giger's aliens mating with humans? Why yes, it probably is. And for some people that's enough to warrant watching it regardless of whom the lead body actress is. Giger's designs were sexually suggestive to begin with and with this movie he finally got to see them doing the nasty. I trust he was well paid.In any event it's a wildly popular film for reasons that have nothing to do with the professionalism of the cast & crew. Which by the way someone should have told them before prodding us with their serious, emotive performances that serve as buffer zones between the sex & ooze scenes. Only Michael Madsen seems to be aware that it was essentially an exploitation film and acts accordingly. He's spoken of his pride in the work and it shows, especially when considering that he turned up for SPECIES 2 with it's bonus deathmatch levels and Capture The Flag mod.6/10",Species

64,Ben_Cheshire,"Natascha Henstridge naked, but otherwise the worst movie ever made.",2,17 April 2004,"This movie does everything wrong. Terrible, corny dialogue, which results in terrible performances by actors trying to keep straight faces, a nauseating cast of supporting characters, Forest Whittaker's psychic (who sees the alien has abandoned her car and predicts ""she walked""; sees two people chatting intimately at a bar and predicts ""they like each other,"" and is the last to realise that the alien wants to have a baby), Michael Madsen doing his pretensious sunglasses-wearing, brow-furrowing, i-used-to-be-in-Reservoir-Dogs aren't-i-a-toughguy thing, Ben Kingsley with a strange hybrid accent doing an impression of Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina and that chick from CSI looking young and old respectively, yet both still quite annoying.This movie doesn't even have the appeal of fun bad movies - it takes itself by far too seriously for the rubbish it is: an evil government agency man (mad scientist) injects a beautiful girl's DNA with Alien DNA and it escapes and starts killing people for no good reason. Michelle Williams from Dick and TV's Dawson's Creek is one of the only two highlights, the other being the beautiful body of goddess Natascha Henstridge (who seems happy to partake in many ""let's take our clothes off for no good reason"" scenes, always a sign of a quality production).So yeah, the really only appeal of this movie is if you want to see Natasha Henstridge naked. Granted this appeal is a fairly incredible one, and there is quite a bit of it to be seen, but the corny dialogue, posing and posturing instead of acting, and sex and violence exploitation style of filmmaking might make the rest of this movie (those few parts that don't involve Natascha Henstridge naked) a bit hard to put up with.",Species
65,FloatingOpera7,Basic Instinct Meets Alien: Sci-Fi Horror,7,30 October 2006,"Species (1995): Starring Natasha Henstridge, Ben Kingsley, Michael Madsen, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, Alfred Molina, Michelle Williams, Virginia Morris, Herta Ware, Shirley Prestia, David Selburg, William Bumiller, Whip Hubley, Anthony Guidera, Don Fischer, Jordan Lund, Scott McKenna, Jayne Luke, Melissa Bickerton, William Utay, Stogie Kenyatta, Gary Bullock, Susan Hauser, Matthew Ashford, Richard FAncy, Leslie Ishii, Marliese Schneider, Ed Stone, Pamela Cook, Dendrie Taylor, DAna Hee, Jellybean Benitez, Jimmy Chunga, Coati Mundi, Zak Knutson....Director Roger Donaldson, Screenplay Dennis Feldman.There are some science fiction horror films that, try as they might to appear like a sensational, top-notch thriller with serious Hollywood actors, fail miserably due to reasons such as a poor script and weak premise. This is the case with ""Species"", from Director Roger Donaldson, released in 1995. It was not a surprise to many when this film went straight to video or the airplane movie feature. Possibly inspired by the more successful blockbuster hit ""Alien"" (which had starred Sigurney Weaver) and its sequels, ""Species"" starred A-list actor Sir Ben Kingsley and then popular actress Natasha Henstridge. Ben Kingsley won the Oscar for his role as Ghandi in the 1985 film. Here, Kingsley portrays the British Doctor Xavier Fitch, who together with Doctors Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) and Stephen Arden, decide to play God and create a hybrid- a perfect specimen of a woman (Natasha Henstridge) who has one human parent and one space alien parent. The alien side of her, of course, takes over completely. Before long, Dr. Fitch and his crew realize what a monster and global threat they have unleashed. The creature assumes the body of the seemingly innocent, blonde beauty Sil who immediately sets out to mate and populate the earth to a degree they will destroy all the humans, whom she believes are inferior. She seeks out nightclubs in LA to find the right mate. Dr. Fitch, Dr. Baker and Dr. Arden have a strong hero on their side- Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen) who wishes to put an end to the alien's predatory game. The film did not do well at the box office because the script by Dennis Feldman is nothing noteworthy and borders on camp. It's likely he was influenced by episodes of the popular series ""The X Files"" but he is clearly trying too hard and produced nothing good. The photography and cinematography is by foreign, no-name Andrzej Bartkowiak, who is clearly attempting to make this film look like a thriller modeled after ""Basic Instinct"" and ""Alien"". Natasha Henstridge behaves like Sharon Stone in ""Basic Instinct"" when she is after what she wants- which is a sexual partner. Nevertheless, she is wooden and robotic in her performance, even when she attempts to behave like a normal human female. The music by Chris Young is rather dramatic but not memorable. This movie is now mostly enjoyed by young sci-fi fanatics who don't mind the cheesiness and appears on TV and cable in the late night hours. It is nothing worth raving about but it has a certain badness that also makes it good. I give it at least a 7.",Species

A secret governmental group, led by Kingsley, is mixing human DNA with a code they received from outer space (why is not clear), creating 'Sil', a young woman (Natasha Henstridge) who has a serious appetite for eating and mating. When she escapes the lab she was in, a group of experts set out to hunt and eventually kill her.Great over the top performances by Kingsley, Madsen and in particular Whitaker, who's whispering incoherently to the camera while wearing some sort of silly hat. Meanwhile, Henstridge is a nice surprise as a first-timer, and not that bad for the eye either.When the team finally faces battle with 'Sil' (in an underground oil cave?) all logic is thrown overboard, but what remains is a fun movie.

67,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Los Angeles is where the battle will be fought and won""",7,8 December 2019,Species is a somewhat ambitious science fiction horror movie and while not the first movie to feature alien/human hybrids it's definitely one of the best and most unique of the science fiction horror genre and stands out on it's own with a simple yet interesting concept where the alien/human hybrid is a beautiful sexy and desirable female who blends in perfectly with a crowd puts people at ease and is the physical personification of innocence and perfection but inside hides a terrifying creature that has only one instinct one desire one purpose to mate with a healthy human male and pro create the perfect organism to replace human kind.The storyline involves scientists sending a message through space in the hopes of making contact with intelligent alien life sent in the message are information about earth and its population ect and the DNA code for humankind when earth receives a message back from unknown life in space with information detailing how to create a clean and unlimited energy source and an altered structure of the human DNA code scientists enter this new genetic structure into human cells and growing the first human/alien hybrid but after observing the seemingly human baby grow at an accelerated rate and show signs of possible mutation they decide to terminate the experiment now threatened the new hybrid known as Siv survival instincts take over and escapes the science facility unable to find her the lead scientist Xavier brings in a unique team to track Siv down and exterminate her before she can mate and kill those who get in her way the team charged with hunting her down are Dan a deep feeling empath Arden an anthropologist who is an expert in cross-cultural behaviour Laura a molecular biologist and Preston Lennox a manhunter who is the rouge of the group together they investigate the bodies left in Sivs wake and track her to the one place she will blend in and find a male easily the City of LA.The movie takes it's time setting up Siv as a character and doesn't just play her off as a one dimensional monster but as a sexy seductress who is looking for the perfect male subject to procreate with to further her bloodline if looks could kill she would be every mans worst fear actress Natasha Henstridge place the part brilliantly especially considering this was her first movie debut but had previous experience on camera as a model.There are several nude scenes in the movie with Natasha Henstridge several sex scenes and also many topless scenes Henstridge stated in the movies commentary that the scenes never bothered her didn't really think about them until after the movie was released and interviewer's and the press would ask about the nude scenes constantly for the next five years but still doesn't regret it to this day.The special effects and makeup for the alien horror and gore side of the movie look great for the time a little dated now especially when watching the movie on Blu Ray the effects stand out more but are impressive for the time and have a nostalgic feel to them when looking back at this movie and rewatching it.I recommend this movie to any Science Fiction horror movie fan it's worth watching at least once and will surprise you as one of the lesser known and mentioned movies in the sci fi horror genre.,Species
68,Movie-12,Not a whole lot of new material--but good presentation of what is here. ** out of ****,4,26 October 1999,"SPECIES (1995) ** Starring: Ben Kingsly, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, and Natasha Henstridge Director: Roger Donaldson   Running time: aprox 95minutes   Rated R (strong sexuality, nudity, language & graphic violence) By Blake French: 	""Species"" is an overly familiar practice in making a bad science fiction horror romp. It does have some campy, run-of-the-mill scary moments that build up enough momentum for an occasional shock moment, and even some squirming at the gore. But all of the film's terror is smothered in its high self-esteem and the character's unconvincing motives. The movie thinks that a lot of kinky sex, copious amounts of gore, and a complex and arguable plot can save it from its own lack of focusing on ""the chase,"" and it fails as a result. 	The movie takes place in pretty much present day. A research clinic in search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence receives a signal detailing some kind of alien structure of DNA. The complicated story line soon makes it quite clear that the movie will transform a sexy young woman into a blood thirsty monster who is desperate to become pregnant so it can breed. This beast is called Sil, who brutally kills many people in search for a mating partner. 	All of this nonsense can be thanked by a no-nonsense scientist named Xavier Fitch (funny how the cartoon character on the children's television series ""The X Men,"" has the same name, hair style, look, attitude, and deep voice). This man sentences a band of police and mercenaries to locate this monster and destroy it. 	The film eventually lacks scary material and an actual reason to see it. There is too little going for the film, besides a few nice special effects. But as for star power, reputation or genre, this is a pale wannabe. The cast here, including some very big and highly commendable names, Ben Kingsly, Michael Madsen, Alfred Molina, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, and Natasha Henstridge, all are quite good in their roles, but their characters are seriously flawed. Take the Ben Kingsly character for instance, someone so obsessed and determined with morbid ideas it is hard to feel any kind of empathy for him. The context of ""Species"" may have had a chance at being something effective if the characters had been better written.
""Species"" is the kind of horror thriller that will surely be remembered for some time to come--even though it is not a good movie. The film offers so much for adult audiences though; the cast, the occasional suspenseful atmosphere, the controversial subject matter, the popular and good looking cast, and the list continues. Since the film's release in 1995, there has been a sequel that followed in an attempt to keep audiences in remembrance of this production. But the filmmakers' attempts have been mostly unsuccessful--mainly due to the fact that there simply is not a whole lot about this film that deserves to be remembered.

73,DavidSim240183,Natasha Henstridge is a real man-eater. Literally!,7,14 May 2007,"Species was made a whole 16 years after Alien. And it was the success of Species that led to a whole new batch of revivals (ripoffs!) on that same theme. Alien predator on a killing spree. The novelty of Species is this is an alien/human hybrid. Its a woman. And there's even a hint of Basic Instinct thrown in for good measure.Although Species has been trashed in quite a few corners, its not an altogether bad film. In fact, its a guilty pleasure of mine. Its got a little bit more going for it than your standard, run of the mill B-Grade creature feature. Its got good direction. Some stunning conceptual designs from ""Alien"" man H.R Giger himself. The haunting musical score from Christopher Young is effective. And there's a surprisingly good cast.We've got Ben Kingsley as Dr Xavier Fitch, the sinister scientist who's let this monster loose on the public. He's the last person you'd expect to find in a film like this.Michael Madsen is good as always as Preston Lennox, a freelance troubleshooter. With all the best lines.Alfred Molina puts in a humorous turn as anthropologist Dr Stephen Arden.Marg Helgenberger is OK as biologist Laura Baker.And Forest Whitaker, in a role 100 light-years away from his Oscar winning Idi Amin, puts in a rather irritating performance as empath Dan Smithson. A psychic who seems to be one step behind everybody else.Species brought to light the previously unknown Natasha Henstridge as Sil, the shape-shifting sex-bomb desperate to mate with a compatible male and start a whole new species. She's certainly physically matched to the role. She spends half the time topless, peeling off her clothes at every opportunity. When it comes to actual acting ability, Henstridge expectedly comes up a bit short. She never really generates much of a threatening presence. Famke Janssen would have been more ideal to the part. With her exotic good looks, she can tantalise and communicate sinister intent all at the same time.Also Sil picks up driving and accessorising in a surprisingly short amount of time. She's designed to be threatening or fragile depending on the needs of the moment. Which is pretty poor writing if you ask me.But despite the utter predictability of it all, I for one rather liked Species. Its quite easy to get into, and there are moments that hold an intensifying charge. The scenes of a teenage Sil about to be killed through Cyanide by Fitch is a real corker of an opener. As is her escape, and her eventual metamorphosis into the beautiful, adult Sil.Its nice to see H.R Giger back in SF again. And with Species, he does manage to craft more of his customary striking imagery. Sil's nightmares are interesting but much too brief to leave any real lasting impact. Except for the image of a train that almost looks like carriages engaged in a sexual act. When it comes to creating the alien half of Sil, he's less successful. She looks like a poor imitation of Giger's own designs for Alien. And the special effects are so variable they never instill an inhuman, unearthly horror in you like they're supposed to.Species is at its most effective when the plot is moving along. And for the most part, it moves at a brisk pace. Like the team's investigations and Sil's discovery of her alien half. Some scenes don't work. The scene where Preston and Laura are trapped in a lab with a growing alien DNA sample begins on a suspenseful note, but it goes on for far too long. And Ben Kingsley's annoyingly bureaucratic performance saps the scene of all its shock value. Compare it to Ripley and Newt's similar situation with two face-huggers in Aliens. That's the way to do it!Also, what exactly are Sil's nightmares supposed to represent? The film never bothers to explain. I get the impression at perhaps some early stage, they would have played a more important part than they do. Even Sil questions what they mean at one point. But obviously any further development on that subject has been left on the cutting room floor. So Sil's motivations are maddeningly incomplete. We're never even sure why she wants a baby so badly. She just suddenly decides she does. (An excuse to include some sex scenes probably!).Species does make up for some shortcomings in other areas. The byplay between the team feels natural and easygoing. And Michael Madsen saves a lot of scenes with his droll delivery. When Fitch tells them they made Sil female because she would be more docile and controllable, Preston replies: ""You guys don't get out much!""They are really just a bunch of stereotypes, but because they're such a good bunch of actors, they help to make Species more enjoyable than it has a right to be. Shame that at the end the film heads straight for B-Movie territory. Beforehand, there are some genuine jolts. Like the horrible scene when Sil cuts off a woman's thumb just to see what will happen.But at the end, it goes for the mundane. Starting with a faked death. Stolen from Alien. And then a final shootout. In some caves. In LA! Anyway, because of the poor optical effects, it robs the climax of any tension, and by that time you're half wishing the film were over.When it finally is, does Species leave a lasting impression? Natasha Henstridge's perfectly shaped arse certainly does. I suppose the film doesn't completely fade from memory. But its not something you'll be revisiting all that often.",Species

Nothing lasts forever""At a top-secret Utah facility headed up by Dr. Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley), scientists have created ""Sil"" (Natasha Henstridge), a half-human, half-alien product of experiments with DNA codes obtained from beyond the stars. Unfortunately, Sil has escaped. Her primary objective is to mate, and, with the ability to transform herself into an incredibly powerful alien creature, puny humans can't stop her. So Dr. Fitch calls in a quartet of specialists (Forest Whitaker, Michael Madsen, Marg Helgenberger, and Alfred Molina), to attempt Sil's capture. At the same time, Sil is leaving a trail of mostly male corpses in her hormonal wake. The organic-flavored alien designs for Species were provided by H.R. Giger, the artist responsible for the memorable creatures and spaceships of Alien (1979). When MGM decided to cut the spectacular ""train birth"" sequence in the interest of budget-trimming, Giger personally financed this $100,000 showcase of his work.This campy, cheesy, B-grade movie starts off strong. The major players are introduced, the comedy was well-timed and the thrill was executed with precision. The first half was impressive if I put it so bluntly but its sad to say, the second half drags the whole movie down. The ending scene inside the sewer was shoddy and ridiculous. The acting was okay. Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Idi Amin (Forest Whitaker), Gandhi (Ben Kingley) , CSI lady (Marg Helgenberger) and blonde bombshell Natasha Henstridge who made her debut in this movie was okay in a cheesy, sci-fi/horror kind of way.

Forest Whitaker is even more annoying than usual here and Michael Madsen looks completely out of place. At one point after thinking they have killed Sil, Madsen ends up in bed with Helgenberger. Which is is even more implausible than Sils transformation from Williams to Henstridge. And the other members of the press have nicknamed his character Preston: Press even though they have only known eachother a very short time. Meanwhile Molina ends up in bed with Sil. She has dyed her hair black and because of that he doesn't recognize her. Yes itsa that's stupid. She successfully mates with Molina, kills him and escape from a hotelroom into the sewer-system. The rest of the team follows her. She kills Kingsley and almost immediately after that give birth to an alien-boy that almost immediately transformi nto a ten year old boy. Madsen kills her and her kid and the movie ends with a rat with alien dna in it somehow.The whole time I actually rooted for Sil, because the team are morons and Sil just wants to have fun. Leave her alone already.The special effects are mostly cgi and that cgi is as awful as the movie even for 1995. The practical effects are decent but could have been better, have they used Stan Winston for those.Like said all of the actors, especially Madsen seem uncomfortable being in the movie and they must all have shown up for a paycheck, knowing ahead that the movie would be terrible. Madsen might also have taken a bigger paycheck than the others for his role after appearing in the great ""The Getaway"" by the same director: Roger Donaldson, the year before. Where he was the great psychotic badguy Rudy. Maybe thinking: Roger knows what he's doing. Roger didn't know what he was doing or he didn't care. Funny thing is, two years after making this awful movie, Roger made another great movie: Dantes Peak.Anyway aside from Henstridges nude scenes, there is nothing worth seeing here. Instead I recommend watching the far superior much older ""The Thing"", which despite a budget: 20 million dollars smaller than Species and no cgi comes off as far more convincing as far as special effects goes.You will have more fun watching paint dry, than suffer through Species.My two stars goes to the casting of Henstridge and to her for despite being the villain, she is still the most likeable character in the movie.",Species
83,LinkGoku,why such a low IMDb rating?,10,1 August 2010,"i remember when i was younger and my parents had the VHS of this movie and i was always asking them if i could watch it but they said i was to young, i instead watched the copped up version on TV, now recently i found this on DVD and i decided to buy it, i watched it again, and i realized that this movie was brilliant, especially for saying that it was made fifteen years ago.Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger play a convincing couple, Forest Whitaker deserves an Oscar, Alfred Molina does very well for his small but somewhat funny role, Ben Kingsley does great as a crochity old fart, and new comer Natasha Henstridge is/does beautiful(y) as the ""Species."" I here a lot of people put this movie down because they think that its just filled with sex and nudity, but really if you think about it its reasonable, thats SID's mission in the movie.also the special effects are astonishing for fifteen years ago, though sadly i feel it's just a matter of time until they remake this gem of a film.i give SPECIES a 10/10 because i cant think of anything that i didn't like about this movie.",Species

86,KillerLord,An Okay Movie!,6,14 September 2008,"Believe it or not but I was pressurized to see the movie by my peers because of Natasha Henstridge. I was told that her role in the movie was amazing. And I being that straight thinking guy, I had come thinking that she might have done some tough role in a nice way and I soon realized why my peers had admired her. They admired her for her body and nothing else. For you see, there is nothing in Natasha's character that makes you identify with her or sympathize with her. And thanks to the concept of the movie, nor does the movie make you feel like sleeping with her unless of course you are foolish enough.The plot of the movie is loose. You have an alien who is a girl child. She explodes through the time line growing up really fast. Soon, she is old enough to copulate and reproduce. And there is a bunch of guys who want to make sure she does not reproduce for the simple reason that you do not want the earth to be full of alien kids. Now, in all her desperation to copulate you get to see Natasha's character with bare minimum clothing. And just you are getting in the mood she turns into her alien form and then does something that leaves a bloody mess. It takes away the whole mood. So, in the end neither do you have the scope to appreciate the depth of a character and neither do you have the will to dream about spending a good time with her! The movie could have gone in a different direction. Instead of a mindless struggle of the character to have sex and a mindless chase of the agents to catch her and prevent her from doing so, the movie could have shown some kind of a struggle between the human side and the alien side. After all, the girl was shown to be an end product of some kind of a symbiotic combination of the human and the alien DNA. Or the movie could have made the sensual part more sensual and the movie would have had a cult following among some. At the same time, I must confess that the movie is a one time watch. But there is nothing in the movie that will make you go back and see it again.",Species
87,richard-wheeler,Sexy Almost Evil.,8,3 December 2005,"I remembered when this movie was first advertised in South Africa in 1995 when I was 8 years old. And the advertisements made me so scared that I thought if I went to the toilet, a tentacle would grab me and pull me down! Anyways, this was a Sci-Fi story about a half alien, half girl who was 12 years of age named 72100 or Sil (Michelle Williams). She was created in a lab in Utah, USA and she only grew up within a month. And soon, her creator Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) decided to gas her. Suddenly, she broke out of her glass container while she was being gassed and she ran. Phew! That girl was super strong and fit! Sil has these continuous dreams about being run over by some monster train and mating. And then, she would wake up and she was in trouble. For example, when she woke up after dreaming about being attacked by the monster train and some train hobo. She saw the train hobo (Scott McKenna) who was going to rape her. And she grabbed him by the neck, threw him across the room, he landed upside down and his neck snapped.When she got off the train the next day, she slipped onto another one and when she got on. She broke open a cupboard which had money in it and she took it and some food from the kitchen. You should've seen how she ate a banana. She first bites off the skin and then she ate the fruit which was inside.And on that night, Sil ate so much she spun into a cocoon. And soon, when the Female Conductor (Esther Scott) came to check on Sil. The Female Conductor went into the bathroom and saw a giant, pumping cocoon. And she was attack and Sil came out of the cocoon. She was fully grown. She was about 23 years of age.Not so soon, Fitch organizes a group in order to catch Sil. The group members were: Dr. Stephen Arden (Alfred Molina), Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen), Dan Smithson (Forest Whitaker) and Dr.Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger). And at the same time, Sil was getting off the train in Los Angeles, California. She was very beautiful. And she also took off the Female Conductor's credit card in order to survive.At a night club, Sil sure did get destructive due to seeing a man's wife with the man she loved and she killed the woman off when she went to the toilet. She later bumped into another guy at the nightclub called Robby (Anthony Guidera). She then went off with Robby to his house. And when she kissed him, her tongue shot out of his head! And she drove off in Robby's car while the gang were still checking out the place and the cops too. It seems Sil was keen on mating.After an accident, Sil went home with the guy who took her to the hospital named John Carey (Whip Hubley). And that evening, Sil drowned John in the jacuzzi when she sensed the people who were looking for her were at the front door.. And soon, the gang and the cops discovered the body.After the incident, Sil shot into a woman's car (Marliese Schneider) and she said she needed her help. At the woman's house, Sil tied up the woman to her bed. Sil then cut her thumb off and it grew back. The woman was so freaked out! Later, Sil set up a trap with tubs of petrol which led down the hill and with a power plant which was at the bottom of a hill. That evening, Sil got outside the nightclub, the cops and the gang followed her into the hills followed by the helicopters. Sil drove down the hill, she shot out of the car and she left the woman who she captured in the car. The woman died in a collision went the car hit the power plant. It was quite a sight to see with all those tubs of petrol exploding trying to destroy those helicopters! And from here, the gang, Fitch and the cops thought Sil was dead. Well, she wasn't.Soon, Sil reappeared with dyed hair. And she surprises Stephen when he entered his room. She then slept with him. While Dan was sleeping, he woke up and sensed that Sil was still alive. And then, Stephen was killed by Sil (Frank Welker). And the gang woke up and when they went into Stephen's room, they found him dead! And Sil headed for the sewer. WOW! She sure was fast moving! And she killed Fitch in a almost a split second! Sil hid away and she gave birth to her baby (Kurtis Burow). It was very interesting way of giving birth. The baby came out of Sil's stomach and she was still alive! And when Dan saw Sil's baby. It was a boy! But it was ONE NASTY BABY!!!! It shot out it's tongue and it ate a rat! And THEN!!!! It grew into a huge monster! And Dan killed it with a blow torch. And Preston threw Sil into a fire of flames and then he blew her head off! And to end the review, there was one COOL scene when a rat ate a tentacle of Sil's and then, its tongue shot out and it ate a rat which scoured around close by. HECTIC! This was a very well produced movie for a 90s film. And you should check out the effects on DVD!!! They are amazing!!",Species

Alien a pure mixture of Xenomorph(looks like Giger isn't that inventive after all) and tentacles from The Thing.2. Alien disguises as a human.3. The trick is in the DNA.4. You get a doofus team of ""experts""5.

And, unlike the real horror of the Thing, with endless thrill and plot twists, this movie doesn't even try to be predictable.The whole movie revolves around just look at... nothing really. With a few cheap jumpscares. And a finale that... well, really, fits more for a 2010+ Sci-Fi movie than for a pre-2000. Really, the stupidity is palpable, it's in the air, in every shot. Practically every action is entirely nonsense. Let's put that into the perspective: the person, who has been tracking the alien - suddenly gets left behind, while the ""big guy"" goes in. Surprise, the next minute the tracker finds the alien. Of course, he doesn't shoot, why would he? This causes the third person to slip and fall, and spend the next few minutes crying to help, saying she's stuck. After that - she will get out by herself and... well, not contribute to the final scene NOT EVEN ONE BIT!Michael Madson playing himself mostly, Ben Kingsley... well, really, I couldn't imagine a terrible performance from Ben, but he doesn't deserve a point here. He was totally wasted, his whole point was - to NOT CHANGE A FACE, not even once, in the entire movie.

90,MadReviewer,"""Feces"" Would've Been A More Appropriate Title",3,7 August 2001,"There's certain films that I like to call ""trailer flicks"" -- films that look like terrific fun as a ninety-second trailer or preview, but make a rotten ninety-minute movie.  ""Species"" is a terrific example of a trailer flick.  Lots of action, lots of science fiction technobabble, alien monster designs by H.R. Giger (of ""Alien""), good actors, a drop-dead gorgeous, sexy babe to play a sex-crazed alien . . . what more could a filmgoer (or, at least a sci-fi filmgeek) want?  As it turns out, quite a lot, actually. Like a plot.  Or a sense of direction.  Or an ounce of common sense.  Or a clue.   ""Species"" features none of these commodities, which makes it unappealing for the vast majority of filmgoers; it also features precious few moments of excitement, gratuitous violence, and gratuitous nudity, which makes it unappealing for the teenaged male filmgeek audience.  Either way, the movie is pure garbage, little more than a ""Friday the 13th, Part 5"" film with a sci-fi label slapped on its side.The convoluted mess that passes itself off as a story in ""Species"" actually starts off with a slightly interesting premise: Radio telescopes pick up signals from deep space that, when translated properly, reveal a formula for an alien DNA string that can be combined with human DNA. This DNA combination, in theory, should produce a hybrid creature that has both human and alien characteristics, allowing humans to learn about this alien species in a manner that is at least slightly familiar ground.  The premise, though, quickly devolves into schlock as the alien hybrid -- named ""Sil"" (Natasha Henstridge) -- quickly develops and matures into a blonde bombshell capable of posing as a Penthouse centerfold.  She also develops a need to breed with human males -- turns out that her progeny, of course, will turn into vicious alien killers that want to destroy humankind.  Scientists figure out a little too late that Sil is basically bad news for mankind, so she is able to escape from them without much difficulty, and it is left up to Professor Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) and his motley crew of scientists and soldier to either capture or destroy Sil before she can mutate into her true, disgusting, alien form  and is able to set in motion the destruction of the Earth . . .""Species"" is predictable to a fault, and offers no insight into any of the potential (and few) interesting ideas it offers.  Who are the alien beings? Where do they come from?  Why do they care about humanity at all, and why do they want the human race wiped out of existence?  Because alien beings are bad -- at least that's the only explanation offered.  Sil, the alien hybrid, also offers some true glimmers of interest.  At one point in the film, when confronted with her destructive nature, she asks her creators ""What am I?"" in a somewhat pitiful manner -- her need to mate and destroy is driven by instinct, not by conscious thought, and even she recognizes the horror lurking inside her.  A savvier film would've explored this idea further; ""Species"" instead chooses to focus on deep, insightful things like Sil removing her bra in slow motion, blood, and big explosions.  By the time our supposedly smart heroes are chasing Sil through a dark labyrinth of sewers, it's obvious that ""Species"" has nothing to offer apart from the message offered in the first ten minutes -- alien beings are bad.
The direction of ""Species"" is obscenely lazy -- most of the supposed thrills generated by the film involve Sil jumping out of the darkness and attacking things.   This works maybe once or twice, but after the first dozen or so times, it stops being even remotely scary.  Director Roger Donaldson's solution to this problem is so simply start adding blood and gore to these scenes, which again works once or twice . . . and then gets boring fast. Unfortunately, everything gets permanently boring somewhere around the halfway mark of the film.  ""Species"" is a film that thinks it's enough to just show up with cool-looking monsters and special effects . . . wrong. It's called suspense, and it's sorely missing from this film.  You'd think that a film borrowing from the look and designs of ""Alien"" would at least have the decency to check out how Ridley Scott made ""Alien"" a masterpiece of suspense.The acting?  Not much can be said about it, apart from it's mediocre at best, awful at worst.   It's hard to knock Natasha Henstridge for a role that merely asks that she become eye candy for the first half of the film -- she does exactly that, and nothing more.  I hope she was paid well. As for Ben Kingsley . . . I'm a big fan of his in other films, but he simply mails in a performance here.  He actually looks bored in his scenes.  I can't say I blame him, given how bad this flick is, but still, c'mon, a little effort, please?  The rest of the cast is completely forgettable, which is probably a good thing.  I wouldn't want to be remembered as a featured actor in ""Species"", either.""Species"" is a film that aspires for big-budget greatness.  Unfortunately, it's crap that even Roger Corman wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. There's worse sci-fi films than ""Species"" -- namely, ""Species 2"" -- but not many.  Unless you want to deliberately waste an hour and a half of your life, don't bother with this movie.  Grade: D",Species

93,Aphex97,Interesting and action packed Sci-Fi...just skip the ending,7,5 June 2001,"This movie has a nice blend of intrigue and action. An interesting science fiction premise; aliens send radio message in response to our radio signals being sent out into space. This alien message details how to combine human DNA with Alien DNA. A Top Secret government project ensues and follows the direction to create ""Sil"" (half human/ half something else). Orders come from above to terminate the creature, but Sil escapes as her abilities were drastically underestimated. The rest of the movie follows a special unit as they attempt to track the rogue creature, and it attempts to situate itself in modern Los Angeles. Natasha Henstridge is excellent as the awkward but vicious creature ""Sil"". It was interesting to watch her character learn by observation the habits and practices of humans. Generally competent performances all around. Michael Madsen plays the badass character quite well again. Forest Whittaker is also good as the psychic.Good directing, interesting art direction, and decent characterization provide an intriguing story line. The action sequences are pretty solid and engaging. Kind of violent and gory, but I happen to enjoy these elements in a horror flick. Several scenes of Natasha's beautiful nude body, but it fits into the story (Sil wants to complete her life cycle by having a baby, so sex scenes are inevitable). The creature design itself is excellent. A CGI creature designed by the immortal H.R. Giger, I greatly approve of the monster. My only complaint is it looks a little too fake at the end of the movie (not the most realistic CGI effects). My main complaint is the story completely falls apart at the end. I suggest turning the movie off once they enter the sewer for the final showdown. The ending is rather dull and sadly predictable (not to mention a complete rip-off straight from ""Alien"" with the metal grate walkways and the creature lurking above). We see the creature more clearly, but less would be better considering the unrealistic CGI effects. FINAL RATING 7/10 - This movie could have been great if only it had a better ending. As it stands, it still remains a intriguing and action-packed Sci-Fi adventure up until the last twenty minutes when it all falls apart. Fans of the Sci-Fi/Horror genre (as I am) will probably like this film very much despite its flaws. Recommended!Noob Aalox",Species

Honestly this is the one movie I've seen which is 2nd closest to xxx porn. (1st is the movie 9 Songs which I haven't seen). Most of the movie was just literally just fifteen minuet sex scenes.

98,Alan One,Cliche science fiction with confused messages,2,18 October 1999,"Species follows a team of scientists and killers in their attempt to capture a home-grown alien.  Most of the time the alien, called Sil, looks identical to a regular human woman (well, okay, a regular supermodel), making her a difficult target to locate.  The team is concerned that Sil is out to breed, and they're main goal is to stop her before she does.One of the members of the team, Dan (Forest Whitaker), is an empath who ""feels things deeply.""  He provides intuitive commentary on what Sil is up to and why.  His presence creates the impression that there is more to this alien than breeding and destroying humans, and that there is more to this movie than finding the alien and blowing her away.  But, as we find out when the credits start rolling, the alien really has been only interested in breeding and destroying humans, and the movie was really only about finding the alien and blowing her away.  A movie doesn't have to be about more than that, but it shouldn't pretend to be something it's not.I guess the biggest conceit of this movie is that someone who looks like Natasha Henstridge could wander around L.A. for a week without finding someone to have sex with.  She eventually hooks up with one of the team members (Alfred Molina), pushing credulity even further: so, the team has been looking for a beautiful woman who supposedly acts like a nymphomaniac because she needs to breed, and some stranger shows up in my hotel room and starts removing her clothing.  Am I the only one who hears alarms going off at this point?Species also contains what must be the grand-daddy of all science fiction cliches: the overnight transformation of a child alien into an adult alien.

So at BEST it would take 8 years to send/receive a message, but most stars in our galaxy are 50,000 light years away or so, so the message to one of those would take 100,000 years to send/receive.Then we can't create DNA of a human, how are we going to create the DNA of an Alien species from scratch given just the data about it? But don't worry about those details, just have fun with it, watch the pretty little half-alien girl kill with much gore..

100,rocky_lifter69,One Fine B-Movie,8,18 December 2008,"Species is a nice throw back to a time when b-movies weren't directly released on DVD and cgi was only used when absolutely necessary. The movie world was quite different back then, allowing a movie with a concept like this the chance to actually be released into theaters. And sure enough, the movie was a decent hit in the summer of 1995.The movie begins with what appears like a young girl being gassed while a bald man looks on sadly. But rather than die, the girl breaks out of the compound and escapes on a train a few dozen miles away. The bald man, Xavier, quickly gathers a team to track this young girl. The team includes an assassin, anthropologist, molecular biologist and an ""empath"". As the young girl switches trains, Xavier explains to the team that the girl is the product of an alien signal explaining how to bind a sequence of DNA with human DNA. The girl soon goes into a cocoon and emerges later as a stunning adult that can metamorphosis in a monster. The team track her to LA and race to find her as she begins her search for a man to reproduce with, leaving a trail of bodies in her wake. Eventually, she discovers the team and fakes her own death in front of them, with the intent of mating with the assassin. But she instead ends up copulating with and killing the anthropologist before being discovered and chased by the team. They track her underground and after she kills Xavier, she births a fast growing baby. Shortly after, the baby is set ablaze and the team manages to blow the monster's head off and leave her to burn with her baby.The cast is the strongest part and their enthusiasm makes the movie work. Ben Kingsley does alright as Xavier and Michael Madsen plays his usual badass self as the assassin Press Lennox. Forrest Whitaker, for all his talents, is given some of the worst dialogue ever as the empath or psychic. Natasha Henstridge does alright as the oft naked space beauty. She doesn't really do much but that fits her part. And both Alfred Molina and Marg Helgenberger both do a good job in the roles they are given.The story isn't exactly anything new and borrows from a number of sources but as a whole, it works quite well. The monster effects, as designed by HR Giger, are magnificently executed, save for a few brief minutes of bad cgi at the end of the film. All in all, the movie is a decent sci-fi skin movie that does a number of things pretty good and a few things really well.

101,Shan-12,Based on a highly original idea - Just not theirs.,3,22 December 1998,"The fact that space is so vast and would be so difficult to traverse, the idea of sending radio signals to the target civilisation, so that they can assemble something that can present a message/launch an invasion (trojan horse) whatever was a highly original one and quite a radical new idea - when used by the BBC in A for Andromeda IN 1961. (It even pre-dates Dr Who). This movie shamlessly rips this off right down to the fact that a hybrid alien/female human is produced from the information. I'm surprised they weren't sued (though I did hear there was legal action about something). The movie is quite terrible after a promising first half and Forest Whitaker gives one of the worst performances of all time. The logic of the film is suspect, how does a thousand soldiers from the base manage to be in the all the places, the escaping Sil is not at the start and why do you need to get the bunch of no hopers in this film who had nothing to do with the project to find her. Why not just use the army who are trained to do it - or even the Federal Marshals. This lot would be the last on any list? Worst of all, the end of the film seems to just be that of the film post-production party where everyone goes to get drunk and tries to bonk each other.

The director is a good, competent VERY COMMERCIAL director but Meyer had the fire in the belly. Also his specialty was this sort of sexy death stuff. Could have been truly memorable instead of merely solidly watchable. The movie should have had emphasis squished around here & there; First, we see way too little of young Sil. Her character development needed to be extended by at least a sequence or two. All the neat nuances of daddy (Kingsley) vs daughter conflicts could have been brilliantly riffed on. The young actress (Michelle Williams)was way capable of doing this. All sorts of other delicious bits about the pre-pubescent American girl pop into mind almost unbidden. But no all we get is a little train ride & then the metamorphosis. I shudder to think what old Russ could have made happen here. Second, Grown up Sil's romp thru the LA club scene should have been the whole rest of the movie; death sequence & all. I mean what's up with this cave thing? Caves are such CHEAP sets. When I was dragging scenery around on the old 'Santa Barbara' series they got into a stupid cave thing about the time they canceled it. Half the stuff in the old 'Flash Gordon' movie series was done in cave sets because they're so CHEAP. The final hunt & alien pregnancy thing would have been so wonderfully gory (& incidentally so much better for some great comments on the people mating scene) if staged in disco sets. The alien birth on a bottom lighted & strobed dance floor; WHOA what a cinematic moment. The tyke scuttles off into the shadows. In short the movie had way too modest of a scope. ""Don't be no ant man, an ant man has low horizons."" My personal favorite Gumpism.",Species

Why is he not heading his own ops, and why is the head scientist dude (Kingsly) running the point, like the general of some paramilitary unit? Why does Madsen look exactly like that in every movie?Anyway. Aside from the lovely visuals (Natasha, not the ""CGI""), this movie makes for a fun time, as long as you keep your expectations in check. This is no ""Alien"", but it does have an interesting premise and mostly decent acting.Check it out.",Species
104,chumpsteak,Fun Scifi Horror.,8,1 October 2010,"I'm amazed that Species has such a low rating on IMDb! I saw this film last night for the first time in about 5 years & I still think it's great despite various flaws. The story & basic plot are pretty predictable as with any ""Bunch of people hunt monster"" type movie. Plus, it gets a little corny at times. However, the cast is great & in general, so are their performances. The Alien is HOT in human form & looks very cool in Alien form. Action sequences are good and there's some decent spine popping, skull cracking gore too. Also, I was impressed at how good the CGI is for a film from 1995. It stands the test of time much better than Blade which was made 3 years later & now looks very dated.A very enjoyable film for a late night watch.",Species
105,osnelgro,Worth the watch,7,5 February 2006,"Now I'm not a big Sci Fi buff but species wasn't to bad, it mainly focused on the story of how some alien woman was trying to mate on planet earth and of scientists were trying to stop her. It is just your average story but it was fairly entertaining and suspenseful. Species is fairly gory and at times is quiet frightening but it all adds to the entertainment of this horrific Sci Fi. At first the audience does believe that the alien means absolutely no harm but as the story goes along you discover that if the deadly alien is not caught then it could very well mean the end of humanity forever, this frighten's the audience and makes you more eager for the crew of scientists to catch the alien before it mates.In conclusion, 'Species' is at times entertaining and suspenseful but there seems like there is noway to catch the alien after a while which frustrates you.",Species
106,dysamoria,"Failed to reach its vast potential, but worth one viewing...",5,4 November 2001,"This movie's trailer left me rather curious.  After seeing the film, I noticed  some of the contents of the trailer never made it to the film's final cut.  A  shame.  They were some of the interesting plot elements that went missing. The  actors are a great line-up and do great work.  The plot is a very interesting  concept and the first time I'd ever seen it. The failure was in taking that concept, one that should have been wonderfully  psychological, and turning it into an action movie that tries to follow up on the  likes of Aliens.**SPOILER ALERT FOR CONTENT BELOW THESE LINES** The back-story, the scientists' experiments and Sil's quick maturity into her  adult form are all interesting and thrilling, though rushed and not given nearly  enough development time.  Sil's dream sequences were one of the places this film  shined.  They were stylish and very revealing into the psychology of this tortured  and instinctively driven main character/antagonist/creature.  It is too bad that  the film's creators chose to pursue their own blind instincts and rush into the  action genre. Instead of resolving character conflicts (Ben Kingsley's character  clearly expresses remorse for his role in abusing Sil, leading to her escape, yet there is zero development of the relationship between them - and it ends rather  abusively to the characters) or even allowing Sil to ""grow-up"" psychologically  (despite actually meeting the only nice guy in LA) the film-makers turned to a  cliche of ""hunt down and kill the monster"" with a lame ""it's not dead yet"" ending  (the rat - how lame). Overall, a massive disappointment to those of us that were looking forward to a  thrilling science fiction movie with intelligent undertones.  Though I hear the  guts and blood action movie lovers were thrilled... Has Species II attempted to take more of a psychological approach?  Doubt it,  though there appeared to be actual character interaction between Sil II and the  woman scientist in a brief glimpse on the Sci-Fi Channel... maybe I'll give it a  shot some day... If you liked Natasha Henstridge and would like to see her in a more active role,  clothed, try ""The Whole Nine Yards.""  Charming and funny.",Species

Which it does in this highly enjoyable slice of Sci Fi hokum.

111,Eli_Cash,sci-fi winner could use help but holds up well enough,6,14 June 2003,"'A' list character actors and a slumming Ben Kingsley combined with an interesting twist to the whole 'maybe we aren't the top dog on the universal evolutionary ladder' trope make this a winning sci-fi picture.  Kingsley is under-used but effective, perhaps because the creators of this film knew the target audience would be more responsive to the numerous partially nude sequences with Henstridge.  The latter was an excellent casting decision for more reasons than the obvious physical charms; for the same reason Reeves was a bullseye for the overwhelmed Neo(phyte) in the original _Matrix_, Henstridge's naive Sil speaks little and gets away with being believably awkward.  The ending starts to spiral this ride out the tightly wound spool it started from, and leaves room for the obligatory sequel (which I'm not likely to rush out see, though not for the quality of THIS movie. More for the nature of slap-dash sequels all in the name of monetary profit for which the obvious exception is _Aliens_ to which _Species_ is already the progeny of.  Both were helped out tremendously in the creature design by the artist Giger) which is fairly annoying but doesn't sink the ship.",Species
112,akuma109,Could it get any worse?,1,3 August 2000,"While this film started with an interesting idea, it rapidly degenerated. It failed to be very scary, and mainly seemed to look for new ways to get the lead actress naked, not something good in a horror movie.  Further, this film failed to take advantage of the wonderful resources they had in H. R. Giger's art and design cooperation. One of the all time worst, in my opinion.",Species

114,pdkenny-1,Overrated waste of time,2,30 December 2006,"This movie is billed as a sci-fi movie, but it is a monster movie, and not a very good one. While what ever the producers wanted to achieve with this movie, I think they missed big time. A space mission accidentally brings back some alien virus or something, and it infects people with a magic goop that can spray over distances. This is bit of a rip off from the other older sci-fi movie ""The Thing."" Except ""The Thing"" did a little better job of it. In order to sell the movie there was a young good looking 20 something blond girl who was infected and under alien control had no regard for clothes. But while there is nudity and sexual acts in the movie, it is not graphic enough to save this R-rated bomb. If one wants to see a movie with sex, why not drop all pretenses and just get a porno. Not only did I regret the money I spent on renting this movie, this was one a the few time that i regretted taking the time to watch it all the way through. The sequel was no better. And they actually made a SpeciesIII?",Species

117,peter-mackie284,Exploitation at it's barest state,3,11 December 2012,"Well, I think we can all recall what makes an exploitation film and how it relates to this movie. Gratuitous sex and nudity-check, a plot so simplistic and yet so poorly executed-check, a monster so cheesy that you can't help but giggle at it's presence in what are supposed to be serious scenes-check! When I was viewing this film, I felt as if this was a rejected porno-parody from the 1970's. An alien monster that needs to breed so it goes around and tries to sleep with any guy that she can find. Surprisingly the film boasts an all-star cast. While they no doubt bring some pretty top notch acting, the story cannot be saved. On another note, this movie is a perfect example of how over-dependence on CGI will no doubt make your movie look positively stupid and silly in only a matter of 17 years. There are movies from the 1970s that have more convincing monsters than this one! With that I can only say that the movie is dumb, however if you want a good laugh and go in with the expectation that it's going to be nothing but a cheesy good time, then you may find some joy in this picture.",Species
118,SCY385-1,B-Movie Roots With A-List Cast!,7,1 October 2021,"I have always greatly enjoyed this underrated gem from the mid 90's. I've been a bit surprised that it hasn't been given a bit more respect. Underneath all the nudity, gore and special effects was a story about scientific boundaries, the vulnerability of young women where sex is concerned and how people can be blinded by physical beauty. Anyone who knows anything about good cinema knows that it's metaphorical. This film is a prime example of that. On the surface Sil is the ideal woman for the many people she encounters. Young, beautiful, accommodating, innocent, helpless. She's not. Through the magic of special effects we learn that Sil, who was created in a lab using alien and human dna, is an apex predator on a mission to reproduce. Unfortunately the numerous people she encounters have no idea how dangerous she is but they DO find out. A team of scientists, government goons and weirdos and a bounty hunter are assembled to find Sil played beautifully by Natasha Henstridge and put her down. That's easier said than done though. Sil is intelligent, ruthless and she doesn't hesitate to take care of business. The cast of people chasing Sil is fantastic and you often wonder how the filmmakers even assembled such a wonderful cast for this kind of film. Ben Kingsley, Forest Whitaker, Marg Helgenberger, Michael Madsen and Alfred Molina were cast as the crew sent to find alien hybrid Sil. Sil's younger self is played by Michelle Williams. Their presence gave the film a sense of respectability that most films like this don't have. And of course having the legendary H. R. Giger design the alien version of Sil didn't hurt either. Overall the film is a lot of fun even though it does have a metaphorical thing going which is even more apparent today than it was back in 1995. The only complaint I've ever had about Species is the ending. All I will say is that I think the CGI is awful and obvious and I didn't buy it ending that way. Those grievances have never dimmed the film for me though and I still recommend it.",Species
119,ro-24,"Interesting idea, weak story",5,4 September 2000,"Watched this movie on video, and I found it entertaining.  5 years after its release, the genetic engineering is even more scary as humanity has now (year 2000) discovered properties of the DNA that makes the movie more believable in the beginning.  The monster's resemblance to the monsters in the ""Alien"" movies is striking, although more human in design (Giger).
The storyline is weak, but it still is an entertaining movie.  I don't think this movie appeals to the viewers intellect.  It is a cross-breed (as is the monster in the movie) and draws on elements from Sci-Fi, splatter-movies, thrillers and soft porn movies.The special effects are not as impressive anymore, and is where the movie shows its age.  Although the end is almost a pure ""Alien"" rip-off, it fails to provide the suspence of the ""Alien"" movie.  The cliffhanger-rat at the end is a little funny, but contributes to the impression of a weak script with intellectually cheap solutions.All in all an entertaining, almost-no-brainer movie based on a very interesting idea.",Species

Two good things, I saw her naked, really only half way, great body, and I got this crap free. Everything else was terrible. Biggest zero was Madsen but Gandhi was close second. Why he delivered first line like Gandhi and second line like some trailer hick and the rest I wouldn't know. But I'm sure his check didn't bother him. Ben, I won't be buying Gandhi after this mess, and was planning to. You garner much disrespect from me...I don't care how a man needs to make his living but do it adequately please. You didn't but at least you made Gandhi. Madsen, I don't what he ever did but I know his cocky ass has been around cause Americans love cockiness...On that remark you just know any kind of gayness could kick his butt. The cocky ones are always the first to go, and have the smallest peckers. I can be as straight as I want. When you make 5 million(theoretically) for THAT(this movie metaphor with bugger from Scarface who was going on 60 minutes)and don't deserve it, well, I can write anything I want, as long as it's accurate.

Kingsley, Molina, Whitaker, Madsen all these guys have been in wonderfully memorable, even culturally significant films.How did this happen? It's a movie about and alien who dresses up like one of the hottest women on earth in order to kill us men and make a big mess.

122,bsonnenm,Severely underrated,8,6 March 2015,"Dennis Feldman's 'Species' is a severely underrated science fiction film from the 90s. The film touches on many themes, including the meaning of life, human desires, specifically procreation, human interaction, kindness/empathy, selfishness, fear, manipulation, intuition, following orders. It does so in a way that is mostly sublime enough that it comes across as genuine. For example there is a fairly believable romance buried in there underneath layers of alien slime. The dialog is mostly well written and to the point, the actors are great and there's lots of attention to detail. Combine that with some great and grotesque visuals, courtesy of the late Hans Ruedi Giger and some Cronenbergian body horror and you're in for a fascinating ride through Los Angeles.The dialog doesn't always work, like when they're trying to track her down and are quickly jumping to conclusions about things that the audience already knows. Scenes vary in quality, some feel a bit rushed. While the effects are mostly excellent there are some subpar ones, too.Overall I highly recommend it if you can get something out of sci-fi horror.",Species

If you've got a bunch of buddies over and just want something to laugh at, then this would be a good movie to rent.

124,johndog-1,Not just a ha-wt body...,8,25 June 2011,"Species, for its time, was an extremely well executed Sci-Fi Thriller, with action packed WoW-in special effects work. It is extremely underrated as most people's first recollection was that they were taken aback at how much skin Henstridge's shows throughout the movie. I mean, c'Mon... she's a horny alien, trying to propagate, for chrissake... and yes, your husband was thinking about alien sex later that night with you, ladies.Okay, I'm losing my train of thought, let alone my focus...; This is what most people do when you bring up this movie, most viewers soon forget how awesome, by definition of the term... that the movie really is, and therefore, it's NOT just some trashy R-rated B-movie, like so many were from the mid '80s to the early '90s.The story balance is very well kept from beginning, with solid character development... throughout the crazy plot, to the climax, and quickly to a unexpected, yet fitting finale. Natasha played the role to a ""T"", with her almost, perfect appearance, and bright, and justly glowing & huge green, also already (alien-ish), eyes. Action scenes, and special effects are top notch, as is standard execution by Steve Johnson, who created costumes, robotic structures, prosthetics and effects for this and a cache of blockbusters like Spider-Man 2 (Easily arguable as the pinnacle of the trio), War of the Worlds, the 1989 classic - The Abyss... and definitely not to be unlisted here, Pet Semetary II, the best one in my opinion, and a personal favorite scary thriller of this reviewer. Sorry for the TLDR; run-on movie-geek splashing there.Check out those Green eyes: http://tinyurl.com/6hntl7qOverall, Species follows the winning recipe for great Sci-Fi Action Thriller, by combining great complimentary casting in Kingsley, Whitaker, and Molina, oh, and Micheal Madsen... shoot! That's a Sci-Fi cast, what? Something must've smelled good, right! :oDThe acting and follow-through by scriptwriters from story-2-screen, showed balance... extremely important for movies of this genre. It also stands up to the test of time, which for many of these Special FX Blockbusters, expected to explode all over the tail-bone of a 3-day weekend release for maximum payoff and publicity, it usually does NOT hold true. I'm gonna watch this right now! AND, I want you to watch it again for the 3rd time, but you need to pay for it; you can even watch it on Amazon... see the free preview on IMDb first and get your mouth watering for ""'Ol Green-Eyes gonna get ya!"" - Sir SmokeAlot.Reruns on FX while cooking dinner for the kids doesn't count.

A team of nerdy scientists (one of whom is a great looking woman),a psychic, and a contract killer team up to hunt down an escaped alien before she can breed. It's a fun movie.Marsden is his normally great self, the woman playing the alien is fantastic to look at. The alien doesn't arrive in a space ship but in a dna sequence that is transmitted to the earth and some type of secret US military group creates it. Good idea, very similar to a computer virus - it requires the recipient to open the executable then not have enough protection on the PC so that it's allowed to escape.",Species
