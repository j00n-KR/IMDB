0,MartinHafer,I felt a bit stupider after I finished watching this film.,4,29 July 2011,"Despite being a very crude little comedy, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" got some surprisingly good reviews. And while it's not at all the type of movie I'd normally watch, I saw this during a cruise--and my choice of available DVDs was very, very limited. So, I bit the bullet--after all, I could have used a laugh. Sadly, however, I just didn't see that many laughs and, in fact, I feel my IQ has dropped a few points as a result of seeing this often dim-witted comedy.The film is about four complete losers who, inexplicably, are sent back to the mid-1980s as the result of a bizarre hot tub accident. This is really bad for one of them, as he wasn't even born yet--and something his compatriots do has the effect of making him unborn--and he starts to disappear. So, the three older losers need to make sure they somehow make the past work out so the fourth guy isn't unborn.While the idea isn't totally horrible, I disliked the film for two main reasons. First, too often the film just threw obscenities and crude references to get a laugh--and appealing to the absolute lowest denominator. There is little wit or finesse with this film--just a lot of low-brow humor. Second, there were some wonderful opportunities to make fun of the 80s or have some inventive laughs--but there was very little of this. This film SHOULD have been fun--particularly for someone who remembers the era. But, sadly, it just wasn't fun nor was it clever. It was just rather stupid...and not in a good way.UPDATE: Just a day after watching this film, I also watched ""The Hangover"". Apparently I got very bored on the cruise and was willing to watch anything! This film had a VERY similar plot to ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" but was even cruder, less funny and had totally unlikable characters. As a result, I decided to change ""Hot Tub"" to a 4 instead of a 3. I still didn't like it but it was clearly better and more watchable.",Hot Tub Time Machine
1,bkoganbing,Time Travel Conundrum,5,10 April 2010,"Watching Hot Tub Time Machine today I learned a little about what some of John Cusack's favorite films and television shows might be. Cusack had a hand in producing this film and I could count bits in the plot from films like Pleasantville and The Final Countdown and from television series Quantum Leap and Twice In A Lifetime. I'm sure someone else may spot others. But of the group I've cited, they're all better than the product here.Cusack, Craig Robinson, and Rob Corddry are three forty something friends whose lives haven't quite turned out as they hoped. They decide to take a trip back to a ski lodge where they spent some happier times as youths. The ski lodge has also seen better days, but the guys together with Cusack's nephew Clark Duke all decide to relax in a hot tub and before they know it they're back in the Eighties and the age of Reagan. They look at themselves in the mirror and they see themselves as they were back in those days. There's also a mysterious hot tub repairman played by Chevy Chase whose character is taken straight from Pleasantville and the part Don Knotts had.Hot Tub Time Machine does have some funny moments, but the plot does bog down in some truly juvenile situations. It has of course the usual time travel conundrum problems that the protagonists in these films all face. If your humor has that kind of bent to it, than this is the film for you.",Hot Tub Time Machine
2,SnoopyStyle,hilarious 80s references,7,17 January 2014,"Adam (John Cusack) and Nick (Craig Robinson) try to cheer up their suicidal friend Lou (Rob Corddry) by taking him on a ski trip reliving their school days. They take along nephew Jacob (Clark Duke). The resort town is not what they remembered. When they have a drunken night in the hot tub, they travel back in time to 1986.The guys are hilarious especially Craig Robinson. Rob Corddry is insane. The fact is that the premise is ridiculous and the movie knows it. Everybody knows it. All the silly 80s references are hilarious. The group of friends have great chemistry. There is general insanity and silliness going on.",Hot Tub Time Machine
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Comedy,6,23 December 2010,"Nick Weber (Craig Robinson) has been cheated by his wife and has a boring job. Adam (John Cusack) has been dumped by his girlfriend and his twenty year-old nerd nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) spends his time playing video-game in the basement of his house. When their alcoholic friend Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) tries to commit suicide, Nick and Adam invite the suicidal to travel with them and Jacob to a winter resort where they had been together twenty and something years ago. The losers drink in a hot tub and mysteriously they are taken back to the 1986 Winter Festival in the resort. They agree to live that day the same way they did in the past expecting to return to the present. But there are many temptations to change that night that has affected their lives forever.""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is an entertaining comedy that combines ""Back to the Future"" with ""Groundhog Day"". There are funny and gross situations and the story makes the viewer laugh if he or she likes this type of low-level jokes. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Ressaca"" (""The Hangover"")",Hot Tub Time Machine
4,nogodnomasters,EXACTLY AS EXPECTED,8,19 November 2018,"With a name like ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" I didn't expect a sophisticated movie. I expected a 1980's style sex comedy with gratuitous nudity, potty humor, and a couple of good jokes. That is exactly what you get.Four people with dead end miserable lives go to a resort that three of them once stayed at back in 1986. They go with the intent to cheer up Rob Corddry, who they believed attempted suicide, when really he just did something stupid. The place is run down and not as they remembered. While drinking in the hot tub they get transported back into time. Chevy Chase makes an appearance as a Hot Tub repair man and hints that they need to do everything the same, or else they might alter the future. Attempting to remember all the bad and good things that happened that night, they go out to reproduce it, finding it equally hard to not to change the past as it is to change it.The movie includes music from 1986 as well as frequent drug use, drinking, and sex. Chevy Chase's role is almost cameo. A great movie to watch with the guys and have a few beers as long as you are higher than your expectations.",Hot Tub Time Machine
5,kosmasp,Back in time,8,27 December 2015,"Not an instant classic, but a lot of fun to watch. I think you can summarize it like that. The main actors are doing a great job selling the very silly idea of time traveling with or rather inside a hot tub! If you get sucked into that, everything else will work too. But if you don't like that general idea ... Maybe you shouldn't watch the movie after all and save yourself the time (and grief).It's hilarious and it has heart, even when it's gross at times. Which it can be, but it's easy to tolerate and forgive it for those little moments, because it actually is funny. Trying to figure out how it actually works (the physics of the time travel) would probably lead into a territory the movie would not want you to go ... and why would you want to ruin your own enjoyment ... if you're having fun watching - stick with it",Hot Tub Time Machine
6,gavin6942,Never a Bad Time to Return to the 1980s,7,21 August 2011,"A malfunctioning time machine at a ski resort takes a man (John Cusack) back to 1986 with his two friends and nephew, where they must relive a fateful night and not change anything to make sure the nephew is born.While not the greatest time travel movie of all time, still one of the funnier ones... and it pays tribute to many of the great ones, too (Timecop, Back to the Future, etc.). While the laughs were not non-stop, some of them were good enough to make up for the lulls.Crispin Glover (George McFly from ""Back to the Future"") keeps the movie going. The constant running joke of how he lost his arm is pretty good, and you never really know when it will happen. Chevy Chase has a small role, too, which could be better but is not bad.The film's only real fault is not going quite far enough. The funny should have been put up one more notch. Maybe one more script revision? But the acting, directing and more was great, so still a fun film despite any shortcomings.",Hot Tub Time Machine
7,jboothmillard,Hot Tub Time Machine,5,21 October 2010,"Imagine a mix between Back to the Future and Groundhog Day and this is the sort of thing you might get, it looked like one of those easy to swallow comedies, so I thought I might as well see it. Basically in the present day, three forty-something down on their luck friends, Adam (John Cusack, also producing), Lou Dorchen (Rob Corddry) and Nick Weber (Craig Robinson) are reuniting to relive the good times. Adam's girlfriend has dumped him, Nick is in a dead end job working with animals and his wife is cheating on him, and Lou is a suicidal alcoholic recovering from car exhaust poisoning. The three friends, and Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), go to a winter resort they remember from their younger days, but it has become a dump since then. They do however manage to get the hot tub up and running to have a great night of drinking, and Lou has somehow got an illegal alcoholic drink, which he spills on the hot tub control. When they wake up from their hangovers, the four of them have somehow been transported back in time to 1986, on a particular night that determines the future for the four friends. Realising that they are in the guise of their younger selves, and that they could cause what is known as the ""butterfly effect"", they try to stick to the events they remember. As time goes by and they try to follow exactly what they are meant to do to make their future happen, the three friends want to indulge in their own things, which could mean a near disappearing Jacob not being born. Adam tries to find love with new girl in the past April (Lizzy Caplan), Nick somehow finds out about his wife's cheating and indulges in a music career, and Lou uses the knowledge of the future for his own gain, and knowing he will a miserable life if he goes back to the future. Thankfully the specific events that determine the future are followed as best possible, and all-knowing Repairman (Chevy Chase) says that the hot tub is fixed. In the end, Adam, Nick and Jacob return to the future, while Lou stays in 1986 to become a success in anything he can, in fact all of them have their futures changed for the better. Also starring Back to the Future's Crispin Glover as Phil, Lyndsy Fonseca as Jenny and Collette Wolfe as Kelly. The casting is surprisingly good, especially Corddry, there are scenes very similar to Back to the Future, including the future hit song ""Let's Get It Started"" in the past, but there are some small original moments that make it a fun science-fiction comedy. Worth watching!",Hot Tub Time Machine
8,Tweekums,Funny if somewhat crude time travel comedy,7,26 January 2017,"It is 2010 and three friends' lives haven't turned out how they hoped; Adam has just been dumped, Nick gave up on his dream of being a singer and Lou is suicidal. After Lou tries to kill himself the others decide that the three of them, along with Adam's nephew Jacob, should revisit the ski resort that they had a great time at in '86. It is no longer a rockin' town; businesses are closed and their hotel is rundown at least the hot tub works. As the quartet get drunk in the tub they accidentally spill an illegal Russian energy drink onto the controls; in the morning everything is different they are back in 1986! A look in the mirror shows that the three older men are actually in the bodies of their younger selves and Jacob flickers slightly. With some knowledge of time travel movies they decide that they should try to do exactly what they did before in the hope they may be able to get back and Jacob will be born. It won't be easy though as there are plenty of things they don't want to do again and temptations to have some fun.First thing to say about this film is that it is fairly crude; an early scene where Nick extracts a set of car keys from a dog's rear end should give viewers a bit of a warning! If you aren't bothered by that there are plenty of silly laughs to be had. The view of '80s culture was a lot of fun; both from a nostalgic point of view and as an excuse to laugh at some of its ridiculous aspects. The cast does a solid job; not taking it too seriously nor being overly goofy. The jokes are pretty funny; I particularly liked the running gag about the hotel worker who had one arm in 2010 so the time travellers kept expecting him to lose it in a series of almost-accidents in '86. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody thanks to the crudeness and swearing but others may find it hilarious.",Hot Tub Time Machine
9,paul_haakonsen,"Tribute to ""Back to the Future""?",6,9 June 2010,"This movie wasn't bad, but it wasn't super fantastic either.After having seen it, I was sort of sitting with a feeling of not knowing if this movie was meant as a tribute to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, or if it was meant to be something entirely different. Looking at the movie, there were some strong similarities. Heck, they even had one of the actors from ""Back to the Future"" in this one as well.Well, as for the story, it was fairly straight forward, and it had some nice moments. Nothing new here to make you swoon though. Well, maybe except for a cameo by Chevy Chase.The cast was good. Each person was well selected for their role, and they did a good job in bringing their characters to life on the screen.But there was something missing from the movie. I was left with a flat taste in my mouth when the movie was over. There was just something missing, something that would make this movie unique. To make it really stand out.If you like comedies, and if you really loved ""Back to the Future"", then definitely check out this movie. It is fairly good entertainment.",Hot Tub Time Machine
10,Quinoa1984,"nothing deep, nothing extremely special, but it brings ""the funny""",7,1 April 2010,"It's not that we as the audience are allowed, invited, to be in on the joke of the title, Hot Tub Time Machine. Of course there's that (Craig Robinson, after saying the line, stares at the audience for a good few seconds, just in case someone missed it). It's that we're invited in on ALL of the jokes of the film. So even the ones that don't completely hit the mark are still there, waiting for the taking. It's an amalgamation of what the 1980's mean to us now, what they meant to us (or those old enough technically in the theater), and what today might mean to us even. We look back in sarcasm and derision at the 80's, probably because (as now) it's a saturated period where fashion was screwed up, President Regan was all-powerful, and MTV showed music videos. Actually, that last part is gone, but it makes for a lot of comic fodder.While the makers of Hot Tub Time Machine are interested in using jokes on the 80's for their benefit - there's a Poison concert at one point for Pete's sake - it's also a time machine parody movie. The casting of Crispin Glover isn't just for creep factor (though that may be part of it), or even for a brilliant running-gag (though there is also that), but also since he was a key figure of George McFly in Back to the Future. And comedy from that period is given a leg up as well; movies like Red Dawn, Hot Dog, Chevy Chase (his funniest in... can't even remember when), all make appearances. And the hair, the music, the attitude, the cocaine, all of it rolled up along with the constant joke of time travel in movies: does what we change in the past affect the future, or rather how much? A moment reflecting on The Terminator brings one of the biggest laughs from this thought pattern.But the joy of the comedy is also seeing the main characters and how their personalities go and interact. John Cusack can be an actor with capabilities for comedy, but haven't been utilized this well since High Fidelity (yes, it's been that long). Rob Corddry gives a real break-out performance following his years on the Office (most of the truly outrageous lines are given to his character as he's the outrageous drunk with suicidal tendencies, which gives him lots of room for genius delivery). Craig Robinson adds another notch to his belt of funny character actor bits - two of the funniest scenes in the film have him going on, one where he's calling up his ""wife"" (who is nine in 1986) and berating her for cheating on him... in the future, the other with a girl in a bathtub. Clark Duke fares less well, though is decent as the whiny younger character who just wants to get home before he dissolves from existence (again, Back to the Future joke, has really one really laugh-out-loud moment when it's revealed who his father is).The camaraderie is often sharp and fun, like in The Hangover, and the jokes pitched at that level of comedy that goes from really disgusting (a would-be BJ scene is worth the price of admission alone), to subtle (Cusack's intonations), to just bizarre (the Glover arm thing). Plot is of little consequence, and even less so if the circumstance as to how a hot tub could provide time travel. This isn't science fiction at all, as it's just a device to get the characters from one place to another. What the movie is, ultimately, is the kind of flick I could find myself watching again and again when it inevitably airs on replay on Comedy Central (either regular time or After-Dark rated-MA screenings). This doesn't mean the movie's really great. It just does its job and keeps doing it well enough to be entertaining, fresh, witty, and gob-smackingly funny for the right crowd. At the least, it pays well on its concept. 7.5/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
11,tavm,Hot Tub Time Machine is a hilariously raunchy look back at the '80s,8,7 April 2010,"This is another movie I just watched with my movie theatre working friend. In this one, three reunited friends from high school (John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry) and a tag-along young adult (Clark Duke) visit an old ski lodge that has seen better times and happen upon a hot tub that suddenly comes to life and takes them back to when the three friends were younger and there for Winterfest '86. I'll stop there and just mention how I found much of the movie hilarious complete with funny jabs at many of '80s culture. And a couple of stars from the decade, icons like Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover, not to mention many classic '80s tunes especially as performed on screen by Poison, add to the nostalgic flavor of the period. Not everything works and this movie is no comedic masterpiece. Still, Hot Tub Time Machine is nearly fun from beginning to end and should leave you looking back fondly at the days when MTV really meant Music Television, Eddie Murphy dominated on ""Saturday Night Live"", and Michael Jackson truly looked black...P.S. Once again, I have a need to mention cast members that were born in my birthtown of Chicago, Ill. Among them here are Craig Robinson and John Cusack from the suburb of Evanston.",Hot Tub Time Machine

13,zardoz-13,Taking A Hot Tub To Another Time,8,28 March 2010,"Science fiction takes a bath in ""Accepted"" director Steve Pink's predictable, tripped-out, lowest-common denominator, slapstick farce ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" starring John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, and Clark Duke. This quartet of forty-something losers and their nerdy twenty-something nephew find themselves warped back into the year 1986 where they try to change their checkered past into a solid future. Together with ""She's Out of My League"" scenarists Sean Anders and John Morris, along with freshman scribe Josh Heald, sophomore helmer Pink has contrived a frenetic, R-rated, hormone-driven, nostalgic-oriented, drug & alcohol-fueled raunchfest about life before the advent of the Internet, cell phones, and second-life computer games. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" relies on upper frontal female nudity, prolific profanity, and gender-challenging scatological pranks that will probably rub anybody but a pervert the wrong way. Pink and his writers pile on allusions to ""The Terminator"" movies, the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" and ""Stargate"" and violate one of the sacred rules of time travel tales. Specifically, if you alter the time and space continuum, you'll create chaos and chaos is exactly what ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" delivers with a wink and a blink. Producer John Cusack, who usually plays it safe in comparatively conservative pabulum, like ""Martian Child,"" ""2012,"" ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Must Love Dogs,"" throws caution to the wind with this party monster potboiler. Previously, Cusack collaborated with Pink on both ""High Fidelity"" and ""Grosse Point Blank,"" but Pink served as the scenarist instead of the writer. Meanwhile, you'll see Cusack as you haven't seen him since his 1980s teen comedies, primarily ""Say Anything,"" ""The Sure Thing"" and ""Hot Pursuit."" Mind you, Pink probably cast Crispin Glover because he appeared in time travel themed ""Back to the Future"" as George McFly. ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus Chevy Chase, looking more like Benjamin Franklin than Chevy Chase, adds a touch of class to the project.Life has not been kind to Adam (John Cusack of ""2012""), Nick (Craig Robinson of ""Pineapple Express"") and Lou (James Carville lookalike Rob Corddry of ""What Happens in Vegas""), and these best friends trace their respective tragedies back to the 1980s. In fact, things have been so appalling for poor Lou that he refuses to admit that he attempted suicide while gunning his parked car to a Motley Crüe tune in his garage where he nearly asphyxiating himself with carbon monoxide. Meantime, insurance salesman Adam discovers that yet another live-in girlfriend has ditched him and taken virtually everything valuable from his house. Nick endures an adulterous wife and an insulting life at a canine-grooming salon. The first time that we see him, Nick has to excavate a set of BMW car keys from a dog's rectum. Finally, Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke of ""Sex Drive"") bunks in Adam's basement and vicariously lives in a ""Second Life"" computer game with little hope of a future. Basically, Jacob cannot stand to live with his mom.After they learn about Lou's suicide attempt, Adam and Nick rush to the hospital. Lou's doctor tells them that Lou needs his longtime friends now more than ever. You see, Lou has no family. In an effort of haul themselves out of the doldrums, Adam, Nick, Lou, along with Jacob, take off for Kodiak Valley, the ski-resort where they partied hardy back in 1986 when they were different people. Cruising into Kodiak Valley, they discover that time has been kind neither to the town nor the ski-resort. For example, the bellhop, Phil (Crispin Glover of ""Alice in Wonderland""), has lost his right arm, and the hot tub has seen better days. Indeed, Jacob doesn't want to take the plunge into the tub until Lou shoves him into it. During this fracas, the guys spill an illegal Russian energy drink, Chernobyl, on the console and it short-circuits the jacuzzi's electronics, sending them back to 1986. When they arrive in the past, our heroes look about the same until they spot themselves in the mirror. Each looks about twenty years younger, while Jacob seems to flicker in and out like a fuzzy television signal because he hasn't been born. They decide to do the same things that they did twenty years ago so they don't violate the time/space continuum. Nevertheless, everything goes awry because a squirrel got swept back to 1986 with them. Throughout the action, an anonymous hot tub repairman (Chevy Chase of ""Caddyshack"") materializes and warns them about the malfunctioning tub. Nobody gives a bad performance in this crude but comic romp. Indeed, Rob Corddry steals the show with his maniacal acting. Craig Robinson makes the most of the second juiciest role. Naturally, like the characters in most time machine sagas, our heroes spend their every waking moment pondering what ""might have been"" in life and scrutinizing heavyweight philosophical issues, such as ""would you, or should you, change the future if you could?"" Happily, Pink and his writers never take themselves seriously with ""Hot Tub Time Machine."" In other words, they don't waste our time conjuring up convoluted explanations about how a broken down jacuzzi could act as a portal to another era. If this hopelessly implausible plot device bothers you, then you don't have your priorities right. Some of the gags will make your sides split with hilarity, while the crude content of other gags may make you gag. The gag about the wager riding on the 1986 Browns Vs. Broncos AFC Championship Game football game and the acts that Lou must perform on Nick is pretty sick stuff. One of the funnier gags concerns how the bellhop loses his limb. The dialogue contains several memorable one-lines and the story springs some hysterical surprises. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" qualifies as riotous escapism with loads of belly laughs.",Hot Tub Time Machine
14,grantss,Excellent comedy,9,12 December 2015,"Excellent comedy. Original plot, though can look derivative. The beauty is that, just when you think it is going to do something predictable, it doesn't. Even its unpredictability isn't predictable! Screamingly funny. Edgy, cool dialogue.

15,george.schmidt,"""BACK TO THE FUTURE"" meets ""THE HANGOVER"" ; Totally Awesome!!!",8,29 March 2010,"HOT TUB TIME MACHINE (2010) *** John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clark Duck, Lyndsy Fonseca, Lizzy Caplan, Crispin Glover, Collette Wolfe, William Zabka. Ridiculously, raunchy, clever/stupid comedy about three forty-somethings (and one of their nephews) find themselves transported back in time (hint: eponymous title) to 1986 where they can either change history or in fact do a full reverse ""Groundhog Day"" and let history repeat itself. What shouldn't work does and for the most part is pretty funny overall what with Cusack wisely knowing how stupid the title was (hence his executive producing and having good bud Steve Pink in the director's chair) – and the fact he is a walking '80s icon/in-on-the-joke scoundrel makes the film run on full tilt with a game ensemble (deadly deadpans from Robinson and Duke as Cusack's nerdy neph and Corddry stealing the film as the obnoxious tool who really is a decent joe despite it all) and rat-a-tat-tat screenplay by Josh Heald, Sean Anders & John Morris mixing the debauchery with heart the result is a wicked combo of ""Back to The Future"" meets ""The Hangover"".

16,neil-476,Wasted opportunity,5,11 May 2010,"Adam and Nick are regular schmoes. Together with Adam's nephew Jacob and alcoholic loser (and possible suicide attempter) Lou, they try to recapture their lost youth at ski resort Kodiak Valley, only to find that the resort has fallen on hard times. Nonetheless, they try the hot tub in their old suite and (the clue is in the title) discover that they have been dumped back in the 80s, where they have to make choices between trying to find their way uneventfully back to the present day, or perhaps changing things to avoid making the mistakes they made in the past, in the hope that the present will have improved when they get back to it. In Jacob's case, these issues are somewhat less important than trying to make sure that he gets conceived.I love this kind of time travel/meddling with possible realities type of story, seen before in (among others) Back To The Future and Butterfly Effect, and I badly wanted to like this film. And, in some respects, I did. But there were several major flaws which minimised my enjoyment.It wasn't the smutty adolescent humour, which veered from dog poo jokes in the first five minutes to projectile vomiting and assorted sexual antics - I have no problem at all with that. I do think the movie had the potential to have usefully taken a step or two up from that level, but I didn't object to it.The first thing I objected to was the incessant foul language. I don't mind bad language in the slightest in service of a valid point or a cherishable moment - I had no problem with Hit Girl's profanity in Kick-Ass, for instance. But in this movie there is a VAST amount of potty-mouthing of the very worst kind - it achieves nothing, it serves no purpose, it illustrates nothing other than the paucity of vocabulary and imagination of the screenwriters. It simply alienates. Well, it alienated me.The second thing which made me very uncomfortable is that there is a lot of recreational drug use of various kinds (smoking a bong, magic mushrooms, quite a lot of cocaine) which is hardly remarked upon. There's also a lot of drinking, where it is at least recognised that Lou has a drink problem. The absence of negative comment coupled with the portrayal of drug use as just part of having a good time amounts, I feel, to tacit approval, particularly in a comedy.The third problem is Lou himself. The character Lou, brilliantly played by Rob Corddry, is thoroughly vile in every way (to the extent that even his friends recognise it), and this really drags the movie down. In the third act we see why he is vile and he moves towards redemption, but by then it is far too late. The damage is done within the first five minutes of Lou appearing, and it never gets a chance to be repaired because Lou simply carries on being overpoweringly vile throughout the rest of act 1 and all of act 2. By the time act 3 arrived, I no longer cared why this deeply unpleasant man became deeply unpleasant in the first place, I just never wanted to spend another second more time in his company than I had to.This film was nowhere near as good as it could have been, and it was far, far worse than it should have been. Wasted potential on an industrial level.",Hot Tub Time Machine
17,evanston_dad,Gotta Love Those 80s,7,6 December 2010,"This sometimes raunchy, sometimes sweet buddy movie was for me everything that last year's ""The Hangover"" wasn't -- mainly, it was funny.Four guys go on a weekend jaunt to Aspen to recapture some of their lost younger days and, thanks to a supernatural hot tub and some kind of Russian energy drink, are transported back to 1986. The audience for this film is anyone who spent their formative years in the 80s, and it's chock full of pop culture references that keep the laughs coming pretty consistently and make it easy to overlook the fact that the film's story is a mess. John Cusack is the headliner and Chevy Chase makes a couple of cameos in a nod to his place as a major box office star of the 80s, but it was Clark Duke, playing the youngest member of the group who didn't even exist yet in 1986, who stole the movie for me.Grade: B+",Hot Tub Time Machine

Green bust into the decade with vibrancy,as Hair Metal glamour of red,yellow and glitter are washed across the screen.Making each of the gang complete losers,the screenplay by Josh Heald/Sean Anders & John Morris hilariously pull the roots of the events which led them to dead ends,which jumps from risqué slap- stick set-pieces to close to the knuckle one-liners.Whilst the film is covered in raunchy laughs across the board,the writers keep a sweet note in step with the gangs hard rocking,with each of them starting to suspect that they can use this mistake to change things in their futures.Joined by an excellent Rock soundtrack,the cast give a fabulous ensemble performance,thanks to John Cusack's charming manner as Adam rubbing shoulders with a wonderfully wild Rob Corddry as Lou and a delightfully anxious Craig Robinson as Nick,as all of the gang jump into the hot time machine.",Hot Tub Time Machine
19,anaconda-40658,Hot Water Time Machine.,7,26 May 2015,"Hot Tub Time Machine (2010): Dir: Steve Pink / Cast: John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clark Duke, Chevy Chase: We all dwell on our errors and we sometimes live in past times. Steve Pink's film regards yesteryear as four friends are washed away to 1986 via resort hot tub. There is John Cusack playing a lout whose girlfriend just left him and his nephew lives in his basement. Craig Robinson works as an animal vet and remains a victim to his wife's demands. Clark Duke plays Cusack's nephew who is forever glued to a computer screen. Rob Corddry plays an alcoholic who ends up in the hospital on a suicide suspicion. They all trek to finer times but the resort is mostly run down. An ominous hot tub transports them back in time where they have the opportunity to improve mistakes. Director Steve Pink previously made the idiotic Accepted. Here he branches with ideas and bathroom humour. Cusack tries to deal with a girlfriend who stabbed him in the head with a fork at this date. Robinson makes a nasty phone call to his future wife who is only a girl. Corddry depressed and must face off with the bullies who beat him up. Clark Duke is slowly fading with the realization that he wasn't born yet. Unfortunately Chevy Chase is underused as the hot tub repairman / Father Time figure. This was a golden opportunity for chase to shine again and he is largely placed in the background. How the time machine works isn't explained but some of the results are changed for the better. What it doesn't figure on is that dwelling on failures isn't progressive. Improving yourself in spite of failure is what makes time well spent. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Hot Tub Time Machine
20,FlashCallahan,What Colour is Michael Jackson?.....,9,26 June 2010,"So the title says it all really. Four guys who are going nowhere, go back to a party haunt which reminds them of how life was good back in the day. It turns out that the town is almost ghostlike and everything they loved about it has disappeared.When in Rome, they all decide to make the most of it and get smashed in the hot tub. The quartet wake up to find things and themselves a lot different, 20 years different. Then the movie goes wild, with a bid by the group not to change anything about their past in order not to change the future..Yes the film is as stupid as the title suggests, it has gaping plot-holes, but it has nostalgia written all over it. The fact that Cusack starred in some of the most cult films of the eighties is one thing, but then for it to feature Glover playing younger and older versions of himself, and Chevy Chase (looking scarily old now) is a feat in its self.The is sometimes too clever for it's own good, and the sub-plot of some of the group wanting to profit on the situation is a little predictable and stolen from Back to the future 2 could have been left out. But so much effort has been put in to the film for bringing a real eighties feel to it, and kudos to the soundtrack for not featuring predictable eighties hits.Cusack is as always fantastic, as are the rest of the cast. it has some very funny situations and as with all leftfield comedies with smut, some of the jokes work, some don't, and some of the 'grossness' could have been side-stepped.But for one weekend, these guys with problems, forget about everything and realise just how free and lucky they were, despite thinking they had problems at that time. I bet everyone would like to go back to one point in their life and realise that the troubles they had at that point were trivial and just enjoy the time and the place and the people.I suppose in some sense, this film is trying to tell the viewer to enjoy the present, not worry about the future, because unless you own the titular product, there is nothing at all you can do about it.It's a very bright and happy film, with probably the weirdest sex scene i have ever seen, with son witnessing his conception, and brother listening to his sister conceiving.",Hot Tub Time Machine
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Hot Tub Time Machine,7,17 July 2010,"To enjoy a time travel movie, you gotta put aside the inevitable probe on how the time travel paradox will come to jinx your enjoyment. One of my favourite time travel movies have got to be Back to the Future, and hey, Crispin Glover is cast in this film as well, in what would possibly be the funniest character given the responsibility to carry on and sustain his own running gag through the narrative, which speaks wonders of the actor's impeccable comic timing.As with Time Travel films, the premise can go two ways. The first involves the protagonists (or victims if you will) having to pursue just one sole objective, and that's to head home. Everything is done deliberately to avoid upsetting the space-time continuum. The other will involve a purposeful change so that the future can be swung in favour, though this comes with a degree of danger since the next jump back to the future may turn things into something not quite expected. Alternate realities come into play, and if one only has a single chance to make things right, then it's that tremendous leap of faith to be taken.Which is what Hot Tub Time Machine is all about, with the titular machine being the means to journey back in time, given an opportunity for the characters to either act out their history faithfully to avoid any drastic change, which means to revisit some painful teenage issues all over again, or grasp that opportunity to make bold changes, since life has given them a second chance to try and make things right. This is the dilemma with which the characters grapple with, in between jokes coming out of their past lives being revealed to the audience to elicit laughter.John Cusack heads the pack as Adam the unofficial ringleader of the group of unsuspecting travellers who head back to the 1980s by accident (or otherwise, since Chevy Chase's cameo has a hand in this as well). He's an insurance agent who's getting nowhere in life, and is reeling from a recent breakup. His nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) the nerd who lives Adam's basement addicted to Second Life, is the brains behind the quartet whose very existence is hanging in the balance because he's in a time where he's not born yet, so anything that doesn't go according to plan, may end up with him disappearing forever.Then there's Nick Webber (Craig Robinson) the one time band member who had given up his dream for his wife, only to find himself being one hen-pecked kind of guy, and with any group, there's the obligatory crude loudmouth, with Rob Corddry playing Lou as the representative, and resident horny, alcoholic bastard whose idea of a good time is a threesome, gambling, and just about every vice you can think of. Needless to say, this explosive time-bomb of a character is probably the one who will get you to laugh at, and laugh along with his antics. That, and together with what director Steve Pink found it hard not to do each time the characters pass by a mirror - to show their CG-ed youthful selves to great hilarity.The usual themes about the value of friendship and selfishness within the group members get explored, especially since they each have their own agenda and mission to complete, and find themselves being at conflict with their personal demons. For those who grew up in the 80s, this film will give you that extra bang for the buck since the soundtrack is full of 80s music, and the visuals here will immediately transport you back to that era, with just about every production set screaming at you for attention as nostalgia starts to kick in. References come fast and furious as well, so you're likely to have a field day to catch them all.Hot Tub Time Machine doesn't go for the cerebral, instead it kept things simple, and made them fun. There's no big plot twist and no big revelation, offering an easy form of escapism and to allow you to wonder just what you would want to change, or not, should you suddenly find yourself transported back when you're having that bath. With friends. Drunk.",Hot Tub Time Machine
22,Mr-Fusion,Does the Time Machine offer refunds?,4,12 July 2015,"There's something promising in ""Hot Tub Time Machine""'s premise, like a movie built on a really funny gag. What's really disappointing about it is that it's just a series of tired jokes and none of them hit it out of the park. Give me a base-hit, something. Instead of transporting the leads\ characters to 1986, it sends 'em to an '80s themed party - MTV, ALF, Reagan and some retro merch from Hot Topic; referential sitcom stuff. I'm actually surprised with this being John Cusack at a ski lodge, there's no ""Better Off Dead"" shout-out. The trailer made this look pretty good, but this needed more Lizzy Caplan and less (monumentally) obnoxious Rob Corddry.This just didn't work for me.4/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
23,siderite,"Funny, but I had better hopes",7,24 June 2010,"First of all, if you haven't seen the trailer yet, DON'T. It will spoil one of the few funny twists in the film. That being said, the film was funny, quite unexpectedly so, but I had expected something sligthly deeper, something that would be watchable and enjoyable not only at the level of the beer buddy and the frustrated teenager, but also something for the adult, for the ones that see patterns in their pasts and would find it immensely enjoyable to have a movie fiddling on that.Alas, it was not to be. Hot Tub Time Machine is just one funny and enjoyable party film. Get intoxicated with some friends and see it and enjoy it fully. Just don't make the mistakes I did, in my past, and either watch the trailer or expect thought provoking subjects.And BTW, if you knew the face of the repair man but you just couldn't place him... it was Chevy Chase.

24,namashi_1,Average....,5,1 May 2010,"Steve Pink's 'Hot Tub Time Machine' is an average entertainer, which had the potential to become a rocking experience, but thanks to it's lackluster writing it's falters. An exciting story of 3-friends, along-with a kid, who travel back in their heyday, thanks to a Hot Tub Time Machine! 'Hot Tub Time Machine' has an exciting start, and you wonder the momentum to go higher and higher, but as soon as we're taken back in time, it loses pace. The portions are hardly exciting, some jokes are so so non-happening that you laugh at yourself for laughing! The climax is a downer, it leaves no impact whatsoever! I truly expected full-on entertainment from this one, sadly, got hardly much! Coming to the acting department, John Cusack looks jaded and least interested in the goings-on. Rob Corddry is terrific, he sinks his teeth into the character. Clark Duke is competent, while Craig Robinson is strictly okay.On the whole, this one's an okay fare. Watch it if you must!",Hot Tub Time Machine
25,StevePulaski,The Hangover in the 80s,9,3 July 2010,"Ahh, the 80s. I wasn't alive, but can assure I have more knowledge than most modern day kids. It was the best of times, it worst the primitive of times. Put down your cellphones, iPods, iPads, and computers. Hot Tub Time Machine takes us back to the old days. Everything was so simple, unlike today where you have to know the mass of a rocket to download a software on your computer. What can I say? This movie is awesome.To begin with, it's 80s nostalgia. I knew most songs/references to pop culture 80s material in this movie. Everything wasn't ""I remember that!"" it was more of ""I know what that is."" My mom was different. The one thing HTTM has that The Hangover doesn't is it's classic material and funny nature to it. Its clever, sort of low grade feeling is well used and doesn't feel the need to spit a farce element at you or throw you a curve ball joke. In other terms. One laugh every minute.HTTM centers around three middle age guys, and a twenty year old all played by John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Paul Corddry, and Clark Duke respectively. All their lives are low and they have settled for the bare-minimum. They all decide to vacation up to a classic cottage where the four middle agers had the time of their lives. They are saddened to find that they loss their sense of fun and have basically bored themselves. They find a magic hot tub, that when used, transports them back to 1980s. They try to play their lives out as they did back then to assure no glitch in the future, but want to change the outcome of their future to improve their lives. Its one man for theirself now.A lot of 80s actors return, not in their original roles form the 80s, but just to remind us that they had their own part back then. Crispin Glover (Back to the Future) makes great, memorable scenes. Plus Chevy Chase (National Lampoon's Vacation series) is not forgotten.The film is one big flashback to people who grew up in the decade. It attracted me for the idea of seeing all the popular clichés that were going on, the MTV clips and rock bands I knew they would resurrect, and Paul Corddry. The film is, like said, a great big flashback and praise to everyone who was apart of the historic decade. The Hangover may have been excellent, but I must say, if The Hangover didn't have as funny humor, a great plot, a nice cast, tigers, and Tyson. Hot Tub Time Machine would have beat it by a few miles.Starring: John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Paul Corddry, Clark Duke, Crisipin Glover, and Chevy Chase. Directed by: Steve Pink.",Hot Tub Time Machine
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,Four Drunk Guy's Excellent Adveture,6,30 March 2010,"Well, since it seems that we have hit a slump in the movie theater business, I wasn't sure what I wanted to see. I've seen the bigger movies this year so far and nothing has satisfied me. So I had never seen a trailer for Hot Tub Time Machine, so I had no expectations, it may have a stupid title, but stupid comedies can be awesome at times as well. So I decided to just let all my guards down and just see if I could enjoy this movie. Though I didn't get as much of a kick out of it as I see many have written good reviews on this movie or as I've also watched, it seems like everyone is going crazy over it. But still I thought this was a fun story that brings in a few good laughs. The film is very crass and a little over board with some of the gross jokes, I don't mind a gross joke here or there as long as it works with the story and we just had a lot of that in this film that made me back off a little. But again, it's the story and chemistry that works very well with the film. Of course what would you do if you went back in time? Would you leave everything alone or like 99.9% of the world want to change something you felt you made a mistake on? During this scary decade called the 1980's, heck if I had that opportunity, I would claim the movie Titanic then go super pop star singing ""Oops! I did it again"" as we see a little of that in Hot Tub Time Machine.In 2010 Los Angeles, four good friends have had a string of bad luck with their adult lives: Adam has been dumped by yet another girlfriend; Lou is a party guy who cannot find the party; Nick has a dead end job and an unfaithful wife named Courtney who controls his every move; and Adam's video game obsessed nephew Jacob lives in his basement. When Lou nearly kills himself through carbon monoxide poisoning, Adam and Nick impulsively take him and Jacob to the site of some of their most memorable weekends, the Kodiak Valley ski resort, which like them has fallen upon hard times. After a crazy night of drinking in a hot tub, the men wake up, heads pounding, in the year 1986. Realizing that all the mistakes they have made were during this summer that lead to their unfortunate futures, they decide it's time to rectify their actions and make things a lot better.Again, the movie for me wasn't crazy laugh out loud funny, but I felt it was still worth the watch. I did however get a good laugh when Nick calls his future wife, she's only 9 or 10 years old when he calls her in the 1980's and is screaming at her, of course only being a child she doesn't get what the heck he's talking about. I also loved that this movie didn't turn to the cliché where it sends this message to the audience that we cannot mess with our past, just accept our mistakes, because honestly, who wouldn't take advantage knowing what you know now, you'd want to maybe take out some stock in Microsoft or claim a later famous song as your own. Over all, I'm glad I did see it, but it's one of those movies where I've seen it once, I'm more than happy with that and we can leave it at that. I would recommend this movie for a rental or a matinée as again, quite the slump for 2010 movie wise so far.6/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
27,KineticSeoul,Probably more enjoyable if you lived through the 80's,7,12 April 2010,"This is a good time travel movie and a funny one at that. A lot of people seems to be comparing this film to ""The Hangover"" I personally didn't think it was good as ""The Hangover"" nor is it as satisfying, but that isn't to say that this is a very enjoyable comedy for adults. There is a lot of shock humor in this as well as some crude humor, so people that are turned off by these kinda comedies probably won't like it as much but for those that dude, they are really going to dig it. I personally didn't think it's a movie that you need to rush out and see it in theaters, but it is a super high rental not because it's not worthy to be hitting the big screen. It's just that you will have as much fun watching it at home with your buddies while laughing your ass off together. I personally think that if you lived through the 80's your probably going to enjoy it even more, because you can relate with a lot of the stuff. Although I personally haven't.7.8/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
28,Hellmant,The premise is ridiculous and that's the brilliance of it!,9,14 October 2010,"'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sure to be a comedy classic for many years to come 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE' is about as good as comedy gets! The pacing is relentless; just one joke after another, much like last year's 'HANGOVER'. With lines like: 'We can do good stuff, like prevent Miley Cirus. Reply: 'Prevent her from what?' Reply back: 'Just prevent her'. And: 'I'm married in my heart'. Reply 'You're heart is a liar'.The film stars John Cusack (Which as soon as you know he's attached to a vulgar comedy like this you know it has to be good. I just read he was named part of the 'They came from the 80's and they won't go away' group, along with Demi Moore and Drew Barrymore.), Rob Corrdry, Craig Robinson and Clark Duke as four guy friends who travel back in time, via a ski resort hot tub, to the mid 80's. They're all unhappy with their lives and of course learn something about themselves and how to be happy during their journey.The premise is ridiculous and that's the brilliance of it, there's so much fun that can be had with that set up. The film was written by Sean Anders and John Morris (the writers of 'SEX DRIVE' and 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE'), and I'm telling you they're the hottest writers in Hollywood right now; they can do no wrong. It's based on a story and co-written by first time writer Josh Heald and directed by Steve Pink (who co-wrote the scripts for 'HIGH FIDELITY' and 'GROSSE POINT BLANK' with Cusack, among others, and had bit parts in 'THE SURE THING' and 'AMERICA'S SWEETHEARTS'. So he and Cusack have a history together.).All of the four leads are perfectly cast in the film but if I had to pick a favorite I'd have to go with Corrdry, he's hilarious. There's also great cameos by Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover (who's always a scene stealer). It has all the ingredients to make a perfect comedy and it never misfires; it's just one laugh after another! There is a lot of heart, a message about friendship and living life to the fullest, as well but it's mostly just a non stop laugh-fest.

29,thesar-2,Here's the Beef,8,12 June 2010,"You gotta admit three things about Hot Tub Time Machine: They knew the 80s, they had heart and they didn't lie about the title.Going into Hot Tub Time Machine without expecting slapstick is like watching Snakes on the Plane while searching for a serious Shakespearean adaptation. You have to know what you're getting yourself into, and if you don't, I'm going to yell at you.Now, while they had heart, knew the 80s and got the title correctly placed, they made a very, very funny movie. Funniest movie? No, not really. But they had just enough to entertain audiences, especially anyone, like me, that grew up (mainly) in the 1980s. It helped having both old and new – sad to say (for my age) John Cusack, Chevy Chase and Crispin Glover are now considered ""old"" while up-and-comers Clark Duke, Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry are the new ""go-to"" guys of featured comedies.After Lou (Corddry) ends up in his garage sucking deadly fumes after a night of drinking and driving, he's met by lifetime buddies Adam (Cusack) and Nick (Robinson) who think he attempted suicide and all three plan a trip to a ""happening"" ski resort of their youth, in tow with Adam's nephew, Jacob (Duke.) It turns out the ""happening"" place happened to fall on bad economic times. This doesn't spoil their attempts at fun and at one point they end up in a hot tub (duh) that doubles as a time machine (double duh.) 1986 here they break-dance.They do attempt to follow the butterfly effect, but in reality (if there is such a thing in this fantasy,) they've already broken the ""rules"" by bringing Jacob who mingles with the residents of almost two decades ago. You might as well throw out all reality – for some reason everyone (including themselves in the mirror) sees these time-lost souls as the younger versions of themselves. All except Jacob, who remains as-is from 2010, aside from the occasional and unexplained computer-generated flash-gones. (Yeah, it's late and that's the best I can explain that. Sue me – I'm doing this for free.) At any rate, the rest of the movie with little-to-no spoilers for anyone who can predict the obvious: they are attempting to ""live"" again, get back to 2010, make amends, find themselves, gamble with ""future"" knowledge, learn about each other, have sex and wait for Crispin Glover to lose his arm – long, but HILARIOUS story.These are my takes on the main performances: Cusack was surprisingly and refreshingly funny. It was nice to see him back in good form after a rocky career of late. Duke seemed to try his best with his role, but I've seen him do much better. (Sex Drive, Superbad and Kick Ass.) Chase was alright and Corddry was actually funny as a genuine asshole. Glover was awesome in his reoccurring/throughout role and what a great throwback to the other ""80s time machine movie"" Back to the Future he was.The one person that really stood out, however, and not in a good way, was Robinson. I love him in The Office, and many movies, but here, he seemed like he was sleepwalking through this or phoning his performance in. Honestly, he looked as if he was going through the motions and truly wanted to be someplace (or time) else.But, did we watch this for any of the performances? Hell, no. Maybe the nostalgia? The music? The legwarmers? Perhaps. But, for the raunchy humor, definitively. I don't want to ruin a lot of this. Instead, if you're into an adult ""put the kids to sleep early, so we can watch a grownup"" movie and you know what you're getting yourself into with a flick with the name ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" then check this out. It's harmless for the selected audience it was indented for.",Hot Tub Time Machine
30,cherold,"Silly, funny 80s redux",8,15 August 2016,"There have been many movies, like Back to the Future or Peggy Sue Got Married, that let the protagonists travel back in time and played with the concept of how their actions could reshape the future. None of them care less about any of that than Hot Tub Time Machine, which really just wants to be a 1980s John Cusack comedy and pretty much manages it.After somehow traveling back in time through hot tubbing, three old friends and one kid born in the '80s confuse people by talking about stuff like email. A cryptic hot tub repairman mutters something that suggests they must relive the day exactly as they did before, but things, unsurprisingly, don't go as planned.All of this is just an excuse for silly gags. The youngster meets his party-girl mom. A character who in the future has one arm goes through a series of misadventures that *almost* result in its loss.Sure, there's some talk about life decisions and some touches on the concept of fate, but that's just because that's what you'd expect of a movie like this. It's all about the gags, and with a first rate cast, those gags are often very funny.If you're looking for a movie that makes sense, or has a point, or cares about the space-time continuum, this is not your movie.

However, once there they check in at a hotel which has a hot tub that transports them back to the year 1986, and a chance to set their lives on a different, more rewarding path than they went, with hilarious antics in between.There's nothing about Hot Tub Time Machine that requires any great in depth analysis, least of all the plot. Some films simply exist to make the world, and indeed the medium of cinema, a more fun experience and this falls right in there. With this little to hold it back, all that need be is for you to switch your brain off, have a laugh and enjoy something that may well go on to become a great cult film of it's kind, cheerfully sending up 80s (everyone's favourite decade, even those who weren't born then!) popular culture, fashion and music in a nonsensical but hilarious story, that doesn't hold back on any political incorrectness or gross out humour, either. Serious actor John Cusack deserves praise for taking the lead and being a good sport with more lighter material, while all the support serve their purpose well, too.

34,dromasca,hot tub comedy,5,17 September 2015,"Before I will be hit by the sequel which I hear is much worse than the original, here are my short impressions about this comedy with promising premises but quite a flat and dull execution. Since 'Back in the Future' was made in the mid-80s script writers have found little need to invent credible premises for time-travel films, be they thrillers or comedies. So when in 2010 director Steve Pink looked for one more opportunity to cast his preferred actor John Cusack (or maybe the other way, Cusack looked for a pretext to work again with Pink) there was no need to find much smarter excuses than a broken hot tub with golden water in an otherwise out of fashion ski resort in order to put things in motion. Three mid-aged friends from the 2010 universe find themselves plunged back into the times when there was no Internet, and smart phones got no signal, but they were young and thin and all girls had no other dream then bedding them, and yes, incidentally, smarter movies like 'Back in the future' were made.Besides holding one of the worst film names ever, Hot Tub Time Machine fell short of my expectations because it could not replace the lack of imagination in playing with the time paradoxes, or the platitudes and so expected jokes about 21st century adults meeting the habits of their youth and living again the experiences of their college years with enough craziness, sex appeal or just comic dumbness to keep me laughing and away from watching my watch despite the fact that the film is not long at all.Lacking fun and anarchy makes this retro film easy to forget. Even John Cusack cannot look much better than 'nice'. Easy entertaining for an evening when you really have nothing else to do. Watch it only if you really have seen 'Back to the Future' or 'Austin Powers' too many times. Or if your screen can be seen from the hot tub.",Hot Tub Time Machine

One downside is the writer apparently thinks just by saying the f word, that's funny. I would like to know how many times it's said in this movie. At times, it's like every character has to say it at least once in every sentence. It's overkill.Now for what's funny. Just the generalizations of the 80s is funny. From the music, to what people are wearing, and how suspicious they are of the guys since they have cell phones. The bullies think they are Russian spies.

While in a hot tub, they get transported back to the 80's unexpectedly.

John Cusack and Craig Robinson also had very hilarious moments in this film.Overall, this is far funnier than I anticipated. Being a big fan of the 80's, I was not disappointed.

38,CuriosityKilledShawn,Great White Buffalo,7,30 October 2013,"While the world was still recovering from the over-hyped Todd Phillips movie a smaller, quieter, but funnier movie slipped into cinemas and made a little splash. Both feature groups of troubled men looking for a good time, but Hot Tub Time Machine is just madder and more inventive.Three losers and a tagging-along nephew book into a ski lodge hoping to relive their youthful experiences. But when the lodge turns out to be a dilapidated wreck they resort to just getting wasted in the hot tub. Said device sends them back in time when the circuits are fried by one of those awful energy drinks.Arriving in 1986 (a year that presents us with several plot holes an anachronisms) they seize the opportunity to fix things for a better future (despite being warned not to) while Chevy Chase pops in and out as the hotel handyman who may or may not know the secret to time travel.It's very silly, very irreverent stuff, but it works. There's almost a sort of magical, otherworldly feel to the hotel and Chevy Chase's character, I wish it was taken a little bit further (maybe in the sequel), and lampooning of 80s culture is spot-on, even if it's hardly the first movie to do so.You won't stop smiling for the entire duration.

39,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,8,1 July 2010,"Hot Tub Time MachineStephen Hawking has it all wrong. You don't need wormholes to traverse time and space; all you need to travel backwards through time is a bubbling bacterial bath teeming with your closest friends dead skin cells and dingle berries. Although in the case of this tactless time traveling comedy, a dose of potent Russian energy drink is also required.To cheer their friend Lou (Rob Corddry) up after his failed suicide attempt, equally depressed Nick (Craig Robinson) and Adam (John Cusack) decide to escort him to their old stomping grounds in the mountains – to recapture their youth and show Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) how to interact sans computer. Unfortunately, their once glorious resort has fallen on hard times. Not to be deterred, the quartet proceeds to party in the hot tub. However, the next day, they awake to find themselves in 1986, where all three men attempt to alter their unsavory future.Though it's suffused in time travel inaccuracies and paradoxes, this 80s reference riddled romp redeems its self through solid comedic performances and clever commentary on the current human condition.As for traveling through time via Jacuzzi, it's a lot more comfortable than an interpenetrating dimensional foosball table.

40,The-Sarkologist,Back to the Eighties,4,24 August 2017,"I remember getting a call from a friend of mine who had landed up with two free tickets to see this film when it was in the cinemas, and while I was a little surprised that he had even shown the slightest of interest in seeing such a film, when he invited me along I decided that I would give it a go. Well, I have to admit that it actually isn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it was going to be, and in a way seems to actually be a tribute to the classic teen party movies of my younger years than anything else. Okay, it still has a lot of modern aspects to it, but a part of that has to do with the protagonists traveling back in time to eighties.Basically the film is about three men whose lives have sort of gone nowhere. In fact they have all ended up drifting apart, though an attempted suicide of one of their number brings them back together again. Mind you, a lot has changed though they decide to try and cheer their depressed former friend up by attempting to relive their better days and head up to a ski resort that they used to frequent when they were younger. However, as it turns out, the whole place has become somewhat run down and it seems to be past its used by date – much in the same way that they are.However, they discover a hot tub in their room so they all decide to sit in there and basically have one of those drinking parties that a number of us would have had back in our younger years, though when they wake up they suddenly discover that they have jumped back in time twenty five years, and suddenly there is the whole question of trying to do everything that they did back in the past so as not to change the future, which I have to admit is much, much harder that it seems.I'm not going to go down the road of temporal physics because that is not what this film is about. What it is about, and the way that it appeals to those of us who have reached middle age, is that dream of being able to go back in time and not only relive our wilder years, but to also change the future so that we don't land up in the ruts that we all end up landing up in. I guess this is the thing about this film – it is about some middle age men reminiscing on the past, and seeking to change the future for the better. Of course, those of us who lived through the eighties remember a time before email, and Google, and all that other stuff, and we all have this desire to capitalise on the wave of technology that comes about, yet it is also about our desire to rectify some of our mistakes.I guess I never really understood this whole middle aged angst until I actually reach that point and see what these movies are getting at. It is so true that as young people we literally have the world at our feet, yet once we reach that certain point we suddenly realise that the world has changed, and we are actually no longer young (and that the world is incredibly cut-throat, and definitely not fair). Sure, we all have dreams, but sometimes the reality is that we simply can't dwell on the past, we can only look to the future. However, sometimes, we end up in the situation where we simply have made just one too many mistakes and there is no way to escape. Mind you, I should also mention that there is still the question of privilege, but I'll leave it at that.",Hot Tub Time Machine

43,sol-,Back to the Past,7,20 January 2017,"Exactly what one would expect from the title, this vibrant comedy involves four men who travel back to 1986 after spilling an energy drink over the control panel of their hot tub. The humour is very hit and a miss with tiring gross-out gags like vomiting on a squirrel and spraying urine, however, the film has an undeniable charm as the characters rationalise their time travel conundrum by debating movies such as 'The Terminator', 'Timecop' and 'The Butterfly Effect'. The early stages of their journey are fascinating too as they initially try to relive everything they experienced themselves in 1986 to avoid altering the future with many key incidents (like being stabbed with a fork) nevertheless still occurring even when they deviate from the past. This suggests a 'Twelve Monkeys' view (the past and future cannot be altered), with the film only gradually adopting a more 'Back to the Future' sense of time wherein the characters have the chance to alter their fortunes. Whatever the case, the film is entertaining all the way with a genuine feel for the 1980s and some truly uncanny moments like one character ringing up and verbally abusing his then preteen wife. The principal cast are good too. Chevy Chase is wasted, however, in a cameo role that does not really make sense. Crispin Glover on the other hand is a delight with a funny running gag in which everyone expects his arm to get severed at any moment. The film also concludes with a memorable, life-affirming message, to ""embrace the chaos"" of life - something that its characters gradually learn to do.",Hot Tub Time Machine
44,tomgillespie2002,A film well aware of its own ridiculousness,6,21 July 2012,"The 1980's, it would seem, is back with a bang. Modern music is filled with synthesised melodies and dodgy outfits, fashion brought back leg- warmers (albeit briefly), big sunglasses, and tight jeans, and films have recently been taking a sentimental look back at a time when teen comedies, gory horrors and oiled-up muscle men action films ruled the roost. Yet it is a decade looked back at with as much disdain as it is warmth, pointed out by John Cusack's character Adam in Hot Tub Time Machine, as although he recognises it as the best time of his life, he states that ""we had Reagan and AIDS,"" and exclaims ""I f****n' hated this decade!"".It seems almost pointless to draw out the plot given the film's to-the- point title, but it tells the story of three friends, Adam, who has just seen his girlfriend leave him, Lou (Rob Corddry), an alcoholic who is in hospital after an accidental suicide attempt, and Nick (Craig Robinson), who has generally harbouring the knowledge that his wife has cheated, and is busy pulling car keys out of dog's arses for his job. Returning to their favourite place as teenagers, the Kodiac Valley Ski Resort, with Adam's nerd nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), they find the place desolate and far from the place they remember. After a wild night of drinking in the hot tub, they wake up to find themselves transported back to the 1980's and realise they have the chance to remedy the pains from the past, as well as party like they did years ago.In a world that releases gross-out comedies by the barrel, Hot Tub Time Machine manages to include both the sweetness of the Judd Apatow comedies of late, as well as the misogynist, bad taste teen comedies of the 1980's that saw a revival in the early 2000's thanks to American Pie (1999). Although the film wasn't quite as funny as I was hoping it to be, it does make up for this by having several appallingly distasteful, yet very funny, set-pieces, including one that sees one the group having to face performing fellatio on his friend. We would like to think that we have moved on from the homophobic, racist and sexist humour of the 80's and that we have developed a more politically correct outlook on life, but we haven't really - it's still very funny (when done right).Chocked full of references and homages to everything 80's, this will obviously appeal more to people growing up in the era. Although my pubescent days were spent in the 90's, I still grew up around the movies, which were then still relatively modern, so I did feel a slight tinge of nostalgia (genre legends Chevy Chase - looking old as f**k - and the ever-entertaining Crispin Glover make appearances here). The movie is slightly held back by some predictable plotting, a plot twist you can see a mile away, and some gags that fail to hit the mark, but the film is well aware of its ridiculousness, embracing it's silly plot and thankfully not dwelling on the details. This is simply an excuse to have some 80's fun, and fun it certainly is.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Hot Tub Time Machine
45,zkonedog,A Decent Comedic Romp,6,11 March 2017,"Considering the state of Hollywood comedies in this day and age, saying that any comedic effort is ""decent"" is a pretty, well, decent achievement. While no instant classic, ""Hot Tube Time Machine"" is most definitely watchable if you are in the mood for something a little different.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees four pals (John Cusack, Clark Duke, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry) transported to the 1980s (via a hot tub). While in that decade as their younger selves, the four compadres must both figure out a way back home and navigate the long-ago culture & atmosphere.The most important part of this review is to say that ""Hot Tub"" does indeed have a tangible plot...separating it from most current comedies. It isn't just random stoner scenes or all-out raunch. It is sexually-charged and chock full of profanity, but those elements don't completely obscure a coherent structure and even a few dramatic moments.Besides the period gags, which are usually hilarious, what really makes this movie funny is the acting of those four leading men. Craig Robinson (Daryl of ""The Office"" fame) nearly steals the show, while Duke & Robinson also shine in their respective roles. Cusack, playing the ""straight man"", is just okay. Overall, though, the acting is a cut above most idiot comedies.Overall, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is indeed a watchable comedy adventure that will make you chuckle at both the circumstances and the characters. How many other comedies can you say that about?",Hot Tub Time Machine
46,Floated2,Enjoyable comedy,7,21 July 2010,"Hot Tub Time Machine is basically about three estranged friends and a nephew reunite on a weekend getaway, but end up traveling back to 1986 in a magical hot tub for an adventure that they'd never forget. This movie did have a few laughs but not really much. Many compare it to the Hangover, but in my opinion Hangover is superior. The combination of physical comedy, gross-out tactics and memorable one-liners never get stale. John Cusack, Rob Corddry, Craig Robinson and Clark Duke play the four guys. Mr. Corddry, who plays Lou, delivers the most memorable performance of the bunch by giving us one of the most hilarious jerks in recent memory. Director Steve Pink captures the feeling of the 80s very effectively, with a fair amount of help from the costume department, who hunted down the fashions from the era that brought us big hair and leg warmers. There were many funny parts in the movie also some really awkward and disturbing scenes. Though it was a fun and enjoyable movie and it really made people thinking about time travel and the past. Great movie!

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Mindless '80s tribute comedy with few bright spots,4,27 July 2010,"As strange as the title ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" might seem, it oddly fits this movie. You can only expect so much from a flick that has two nouns in the title that are as seemingly opposite as ""hot tub"" and ""time machine."" It's the kind of title that says ""I'm not going to make sense, but who doesn't love hot tubs or time machines?"" It's a silly, mindless film that revels in time travel jokes and an assortment of gags related to the discrepancy between being middle-aged now and being a 20-something in the '80s. It's the kind of pure sugar fun you need to be in the mood for.Sadly, I hold my time travel movies to a higher standard. In fact, Crispin Glover's appearance in this film as one of the more amusing peripheral characters who is part of an effective through-line gag was like having a constant reminder of better time travel movies even if it intended just to be a throw back for '80s nostalgists who love ""Back to the Future."" The plot moves along so haphazardly that it becomes abundantly clear ""Hot Tub"" wants nothing more than to exploit the idea of time travel. As far as what going back in time is supposed to teach the characters, there's nothing new here.The film starts with snapshots of four men, three middle aged and the fourth is one of their nephews. Nick (Craig Robinson) is on his wife's leash, Adam's (John Cusack) girlfriend just left him, Jacob (Clark Duke) is Adam's 20-year-old nephew who confines himself to the basement and Lou (Rob Corddry) is a jerk who just tried to off himself, which brings his buddies Adam and Nick to his aid. Together, they decide they need a getaway to their favorite old ski resort, Kodiak Valley. Other than generic personality portraits (Adam's the good guy, Nick's the big baby, Lou's the vehicle for dirty comedy, Jacob for dead-pan comedy), we see nothing else from these guys before they randomly find themselves in 1986. Immediately they decide they have to do exactly what they did when they were at the resort 24 years ago unless they want to drastically change their future.The rest of the film consists of insult exchanges, physical gags, time jokes, pop culture references and a few surprise nuggets we have to wait for, such as who Clark's father is. Most of it isn't funny, but the fact that the whole film is somewhat of a back-handed tribute to the '80s keeps things amusing. You can't laugh with this film, but cleverly the writers convince you that the joke is on the '80s, so you laugh at that rather than the jumbled nonsense that is the plot. Rather than try and make sense with regards to explaining the time travel, there's Chevy Chase as the enigmatic hot tub repair guy that randomly disappears. He's supposed to be a joke confirming that writer Josh Heald, John Morris and Sean Anders are aware of their ridiculous script, but it's not funny enough to make up the difference.Some of the dialogue is pretty funny. It best suits Duke, who despite being the black sheep of the film, gets a lot of the laughs because his character exposes the lunacy of the others with dead-on dry delivery. Corddry works perfectly despite not being likable, Robinson does't stretch himself compared to previous roles and Cusack -- let's all admit he was in the film because he was an '80s icon. Some of the scenes in ""Hot Tub"" are like straight from ""Better Off Dead.""Like the '80s, ""Hot Tub"" was a good time, but in the grand scheme of things, just not very good and not worth doing again.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Hot Tub Time Machine
50,Vartiainen,Goofy fun,5,4 June 2016,"So, apparently in Mother Russia they lace their energy drinks with nuclear waste. Which in turn, when mixed with a hot tub, allows you to travel back in time. Sounds plausible to me!Yeah, this movie is more bothered with keeping it cool than keeping it in any way realistic. And, for the most part, that over the top goofiness really works in the film's favour. The situation itself is easily the best part of the whole film. Three hapless middle-age dudes – plus a tag-along – get transported into their glory days, but quickly find that the past, when viewed though the eyes of an adult, is not quite as glorious as they remember. Kind of like Groundhog Day, but as a teenage stoner comedy.What really keeps this movie from being more enjoyable to me are unfortunately the characters. The actors are fine, but the characters they portray are too straight in their clichnédness. There's the poor husband, the wimpy husband, the never-grow-up, the nerd, all of them more stereotypical than the other. And while the movie gets a lot of mileage out of them, and the ending is especially fulfilling because of it, the fact remains that they're not all that interesting and all the jokes at their expense are rather predictable.Still, it's a fun movie. Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a comedy with an imaginative setting.",Hot Tub Time Machine

I love that it's time travel, but not a serious movie, it's one that makes you laugh, rather than think about the impossibilities of the situation. I think my favorite part is when everyone goes back to the present, and Lou has changed everything.In this movie, three friends, Adam, whose girlfriend just dumped him, Nick, who has a dead- end job and a cheating wife, and Lou, a suicidal alcoholic, are all in need of something. When Lou tries to kill himself, the three, and Adam's nephew, Jacob, all go to the last place the three were really happy. A Winter resort that they went to when they were eighteen. It was their party place and is now a dump. But when they all start drinking in their hot tub, they wake up in 1986, in their younger bodies, and they get the chance to relive the best time of the their lives.

52,Turfseer,Losers' transformation into self-actualized good guys appears undeserved,4,5 August 2010,"Who would have ever thought that the 1980s was as distinctive as the 60s, a decade rife with possibilities for satire? Well, such films as 'The Wedding Singer' proved that the 80s can hold its own against other venerable decades. And now there's 'Hot Tub Time Machine', which also takes its own affectionate look at the era when both Ronald Reagan and Michael Jackson reigned supreme.The protagonists of 'Hot Tub' are three losers from California who have remained occasional friends since their weekend at the Kodiak Ski Lodge in the winter of 1986: Adam (John Cusack), a hapless insurance salesman who's just been dumped by his girlfriend; Nick (Craig Robinson), who works at a dead-end job at a dog spa and can't get over the fact that his wife has been cheating on him and Lou (Rob Corrdry), a party animal way past his prime who can't hold a job. Also in the mix is Adam's geeky nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), who is also unemployed and spends most of his time playing video games.The catalyst that brings the three friends back together again is Lou's hospitalization after being poisoned by carbon monoxide (later it's revealed that it actually was a suicide attempt). Concerned for their friend's mental health, Adam and Nick decide to treat Lou to a weekend at the same Ski Lodge they stayed at back in the 80s. With Jacob along for the ride, the three friends are propelled back to the 80s after relaxing in the hot tub on the patio deck of their hotel room.'Hot Tub' is not without its fun moments. Perhaps the best joke in the entire movie is when the protagonists first become aware that they have traveled back in time. Nick questions a waitress as to ""what color Michael Jackson is"" and when she replies, ""black"", he runs out of the ski lodge screaming in terror! Another funny bit is when the trio look in the mirror, they constantly see themselves as they looked back in the 80s.Two 80s acting icons are also part of the cast: Crispen Glover, famous for his role as George McFly in the 1986 hit 'Back to the Future' and Chevy Chase, mainly known for his role as 'Fletch' in the hit movie from the 80s of the same name. Of the two parts, Glover's is superior. He plays a bell hop who appears in the present with a severed arm. While back in the 80s, there are numerous amusing scenes where the expectation is that his arm will be cut off but he manages to somehow avoid the excision due to a series of lucky coincidences. When his arm is finally lopped off, all is made good in the present after we learn that the ski patrol packed the severed appendage in ice fast enough and rushed him to the hospital, where it was reattached. Chevy Chase has little opportunity to trot out his comic talents in the weaker role of the hot tub repairman who merely acts as an adviser to the time travelers, informing them that they must utilize the energy drink Chernobly to jump start the time machine which will propel them back to the present.The bulk of the 'Hot Tub' plot involves the trio's decision not to upset the time-space continuum by sticking to the same script of their 80s foray. Adam's path is perhaps the funniest—he eventually must dump his girlfriend and allow himself to be stabbed in the eye by her. He accomplishes this by informing her that she'll eventually become overweight in her middle age. Adam does work out some positive karma by setting the stage for a romance with a journalist covering a Poison concert, which figures later in the film's denouement.Nick overcomes his insecurities by coming to realize that he's still in love with his wife. He's conflicted at first, feeling guilty while having sex with a groupie but also jealous, eventually phoning his nine year old wife to be, berating her for having the future affair. Eventually he regains his confidence by expertly performing some 80s standards including 'Jessie's Girl' with his teenage band. Less funny is Lou's arc. There's an ugly scene where Lou loses a bet with miscreant with a gun at the ski lodge and almost is forced to perform oral sex on Nick. Eventually, Lou finds his mettle by punching out the leader of the ski patrol (their obsession with Communists would have worked better in a 50s satire but feels out of place here in the era of Perestroika). Jacob also solves the mystery of his parentage when he learns that Lou is actually his father (there's a rather obnoxious scene of 'coitus interruptus' where Jacob disappears after Lou temporarily stops having sex with Adam's sister).In a nod to 'Back to the Future', the protagonist's lives are transformed as a result of Lou's decision to remain in 1986 and build a new life from there. Adam now is successfully married to the journalist and Nick is a record producer. I was disappointed in the protagonists' transformation. I wanted something more for Adam than simply his marriage to a 'good woman' . And Nick unnecessarily remains jealous of his wife for a short time, even after his new found success. Worst of all is Lou who remains the same obnoxious braggart as he was in the beginning of the film and that Lou's success is equated with material gain. What would have been better if Lou had been transformed into a millionaire, but also a philanthropist.It's hard to recommend Hot Tub Time Machine. Yes, it's funny in spots but also can be crude. I know this is a comedy but somehow I felt that the protagonists simply didn't do enough to deserve their transformations from losers to self-actualized good guys.",Hot Tub Time Machine

Will they change the past for better or worse, and is Jacob gonna get erased out of existence? This film is not for everyone, but if you loved The Hangover, then i'll bet you'll love Hot Tub Time Machine. All the actors really shine in there own way.

They're mildly successful in this somewhat-funny throwback to the ski-lodge jocks vs. dorks movies of the 1980s that teeters between being a laugh-out-loud dip in nostalgia and a simple knock off of a funnier movie (last year's The Hangover).John Cusack is Adam, a sad sack pitiful wreck whose vengeful girlfriend has just dumped him, taking almost everything in the house. Craig Robinson – late of Zach and Miri Make a Porno – is Nick, a married man shackled to his dead-end job as a high-end groomer. Rob Corddry is Lou, who's even more pathetic; when he drunkenly attempts suicide, the other two tell him in the hospital that they're all going to a legendary camp at which they all partied back in the day. They bring along Adam's grown nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), for no other reason than to have some kind of moral compass.Somehow, the hot tub at their cabin in the mountains magically transports them to when they were, well, young and dumb, with their entire lives in front of them. In fact, as luck would have it, they're all (except for Jacob) in the same place they were 20 years prior, at the site of the Winterfest music-and-fun extravaganza where each of them did Something that forever altered their life paths. Which, if we know our movie time-traveling logic, means that they can't do anything this time around, or else they'll risk screwing their own futures up.At first glance, you might think that Cusack plays the Everyman of the group, but that's not necessarily the case here. He's a down-on-his-luck schmuck, like Lloyd Dobler in Say Anything, or even Rob Gordon in High Fidelty, but he's also kind of a crass jackhole, which is not a role Cusack normally plays. But he's not a complete jerk, either; he just sort of disappears into a vapid, staticy role that almost melts into the chaotic scenery. It almost feels as if he were cast purely because he used to be in these movies in the 80s himself, unlike his costars. But that would be about the only reason. Cusack's Adam isn't an underdog fighting the rich bullies; he's really playing the role of Best Bud. The problem is that there's no Main Dude for him to be the Best Bud to, and let's be honest – John Cusack is no wingman, anyway.Luckily, Rob Corddry – playing the selfish jerk of the bunch – is able to swoop in and shamelessly steal the movie. It's like stealing a grain of sand from the Sahara. Corddry is all energy, all angst and anger and bald head and rage and hormones and id, lots and lots of id. All id, all the time with Lou. His scenes – and there are many – really perk everyone up, raising chaos up a few notches.The movie glosses over an interesting dilemma, though: if you went back in time, to when you were just entering your adult years, would you make the same decisions you made the first time around? The guys here get that opportunity, and some deviate from their norm a little bit. And some things get deviated for them, too. Reference is made to the stupid Ashton Kutcher movie The Butterfly Effect, something something about how if a butterfly flaps its wings in one hemisphere, a calamity occurs in another hemisphere. (I believe this is actually chaos theory, but let's not quibble.) So whether by accident or on purpose, their behavior alters everything. But since this is a comedy that's a bit lighter than, say, Back to the Future, I don't think we need to worry too much about what'll happen when they do get back to good ol' 2010.In all, Hot Tub Time Machine is a good throwback movie. It's entertaining if you went through the 1980s, certainly – and the period music is pretty damn awesome, and if you didn't, you'll have plenty to laugh at. The actors give engaging performances, but the jokes are often lackluster. In fact, if anything there should have been far more homages to 80s films. Can you believe this movie was set in a ski lodge and set in the 1980s, and yet there was only the slightest passing reference to Cusack's quintessential 80s hit Better Off Dead? Shame.",Hot Tub Time Machine
55,PWNYCNY,A comedy that can make you want to cry.,5,3 April 2010,"This movie was unexpectedly unfunny, not bad, just not funny. What would you do if you could undue the mistakes you made in your life? Not a happy theme, something that many may not want to deal with. Many of the scenarios are rather sad and definitely not funny, such as when one of the characters gets stabbed in the head or another complains, with justification that he has no friends. The main characters are pathetic but not worthy of sympathy. They are losers but not lovable. The least unfunny character is the token African-American but his performance is hampered by the story. The fact is that a comedy is funny when the audience can feel superior to the the characters who are the source of the humor, but in this movie the characters are too close to the audience for comfort, their failures too real and plausible, and therefore its nothing to laugh about because by laughing at them, you are really laughing at yourself and your own mistakes and that can make you want to cry.",Hot Tub Time Machine
56,meeza,A new wave of comedy of the old new wave!,9,2 May 2010,"Man, this hot tub feels great at the Miami Executive Airport Hotel, yes that is where they shot in last week's episode of ""Miami Vice"". I just brought this young Demi Moore lookalike I met tonight at a St. Brendan's Open House party. I am trying to give her ""everything she wants"" but she is still ""hungry like the wolf"" for some more loving. Yea, ""Sex, I'm a. lucky young man"" She is so hot, she just ""takes my breath away"". I might ask her to go with me to tomorrow's Berlin & Thompson Twins concert. It is like 4 in the morning, my parents are going to kill me when I get home! I will plead to my dad to ""relax"" because ""do you really want to hurt me?"" please Dad ""choose life"" and get out of your ""danger zone"". Wait, I wake up; I am in my 40's. I see my wife and I see my dog next to me in the hot tub of my apartment complex. Holy Swatches!!! I must have been in some type of ""Hot Tub Time Machine"". OK, enough! That aforementioned opening is very similar (or at least within the same context) of what happens to the characters of the hilarious time-tripping comedy called (you guessed it!)= ""Hot Tub Time Machine"". Here are the 40-somethings who dive into the hot tub time machine: 80's icon John Cusack stars as Adam, the straight man of the bunch and I am not talking about sexuality preference, whose life is in shambles after his girlfriend leaves him pretty much deserted. Craig Robinson co-stars as Nick Webber, the dog service attendant who used to be the lead in an 80's cover band. Rob Corddry plays the vivacious hard-rocking Lou who goes by the nickname of ""Violator""; and pretty much lives up to his nickname billing. And then we move up to ""Jacob's Ladder"", he pretty much stabs everybody in the back and seizes the movie to himself. Kidding, wrong Jacob story! Clark Duke plays Jacob, Adam's ""goody two shoes"" teenage nephew who just might be the brains of the bunch, even though that is not much of a stretch. Adam, Nick, and Lou used to be best pals as teens and would frequently visit a ski village festival. In order to help Lou recover from a presumed suicide attempt, the adult peeps reunite and visit the ski village bringing in Jacob for the ride. They all enter a hot tub inside their room at the village resort, and before you can say ""where's the beef?"" they end up back in the 80's! The ensuing time-bender 80's madness really took a ""take on me"", and I am sure it will do the same for you, especially if you are a grad of the ""80's teen members only"" club, as I am. Sure the movie does get quite silly and over-the-top, but I ""just can't get enough"" of all the 80's theme, style, and music that the movie delivered. We even get some scene-stealing appearances from the actors who played ""The Karate Kid"" bully and George McFly in ""Back to the Future"". The only 80's repair job that the hot tub flick needed was the useless appearance of ""Fletch"", OK Chevy Chase, portraying a hot tub Repair Man who did not bring much entertainment bubbly to the picture. As far as the leads: ""Say anything"" you want about him but John Cusack still has that thespian charisma. I say to you Mr. Robinson you are probably the funniest African-American actor today. And even though his outlandish characters might violate movie bi-laws, Corddry is on his way in being a top-billing comedic actor. And those are no ""lies lies lies"" yea! Director Steve Pink, Cusack's longtime best buddy, was comedically ""pretty in pink"" with his effective ""all about the 80's"" orchestration of the movie. Josh Heald & Sean Anders' screenplay did not encompass a perfect dialogue component but it did contain numerous uproarious comedic elements, ""for sure, for sure"". So gather up your ""breakfast club"", ""lady in red"", or ""footloosers"" and take an 80's voyage on the ""Hot Tub Time Machine"". ***** Excellent",Hot Tub Time Machine
57,estebangonzalez10,Average comedy,5,21 July 2010,"¨One little change has a ripple effect and it effects everything else. Like a butterfly floats its wings and Tokyo explodes or there's a tsunami, in like, you know, somewhere.¨ I was expecting The Hot Tub Time Machine to be this year's The Hangover, but I was disappointed because I didn't find this film funny at all. It had very few laughs and the only positive thing about it was John Cusack's performance. There are some very few funny moments, but for the most part I was serious throughout. Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high because of the good reviews this film got, but it just didn't work for me. I should have been warned just by the title itself. The film isn't terrible, it's just that I didn't see anything different from the other comedies (puke jokes, poop jokes, etc.). At one point it even references Wild Hogs and to be honest with you this film felt like it as well. I didn't enjoy the performances from the rest of the cast either like I did with last year's The Hangover, I Love You Man, or Role Models. I am a big fan of comedies and usually like most of them, but this movie failed in my opinion. I guess I didn't find the story all that interesting and perhaps couldn't relate to the nostalgic feeling of the 80's that the film brought for some. The story was written by Josh Heald as was the screenplay with the help of Sean Anders (director and writer of Sex Drive) and John Morris. Steve Pink, who is mostly known for writing the screenplay for another John Cusack film, High Fidelity, directed this picture.The plot is pretty simple; three friends have grown apart from each other over time but an incident reunites them. Adam (John Cusack) is an insurance worker who has just been dumped by his girlfriend. Jacob (Clark Duke from Kick-Ass) is his nephew who lives in his basement and spends all day on his computer. One day Adam receives a call from Nick (Craig Robinson), one of his friends from his youth who is now married and working as a veterinarian having abandoned his dream of being a musician. Nick tells Adam that their friend, Lou (Rob Corddry from What Happens in Vegas), has been hospitalized for trying to commit suicide. In order to try to cheer Lou, Nick and Adam decide to take him to the ski resort they used to visit in their days. Once they arrive at the ski resort, which has been abandoned over the years, the four guys decide to get into a hot tub and get wasted. When they wake up they realize that they are in 1986 and they try to do exactly the same thing they did in the past so they don't alter their future. The plot could have been much better, but the laughs are very scarce throughout the film.For me the weakest thing about the film is the cast (with the exception of John Cusack who is charismatic) along with the plot which is pretty silly as well. I can understand why some people may have liked it for bringing some memories of the 80's back, but it just didn't work for me. The jokes aren't very funny and there is even one scene in which Nick's character says ¨It must be some kind of hot tub time machine¨ and stares directly at the camera, which really didn't work and I still don't understand the purpose of that scene which felt completely misplaced. The movie isn't terrible either, but I wouldn't recommend it. Comedies are probably the easiest to critique for me because I can measure them by how much they make me laugh and The Hot Tub Time Machine really delivers few of those, and it isn't one of those comedies I would love to watch over and over again. The movie just relies on the same old jokes and the whole time traveling thing didn't work for me, but a lot of critics have a different opinion from mine so this movie is one of those that clearly divides audiences and you might want to check it out and make your own conclusions.",Hot Tub Time Machine
58,mattkratz,hysterical,9,26 April 2011,"This movie was the perfect combination of humor, raunchiness, time travel, and 80s nostalgia. The movie starts off with three guys and one kid whose lives are going nowhere fast. They get sent back in time at their former hangout resort by the title time machine to 1986 to right some wrongs and do some other stuff. John Cusack is great in the lead role and really carries the film and has to warn them about not causing a ""butterfly effect,"" and makes them reenact things exactly as they happened. I love Craig Robinson's music scene and Lou's character too-he was hilarious. Chevy Chase was good too as the mysterious time machine repairman. I did not regret seeing this movie.

Jacob finds out that his mother (Collette Wolfe) was an wild teenager.Directed by Steve Pink (Accepted) made an enjoyable raunchy comedy with an couple of anachronisms and one fatal plot hole that keeps the movie from being an masterpiece. The four lead actors are certainly game in this movie. Probably the only chance to see Cusack in this type of comedy. Although an minor Box Office success, this movie will probably have an cult following on DVD and on Blu-ray.DVD includes the original theatrical cut and the unrated cut. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surrround Sound. DVD's only extras are Deleted Scenes and the Theatrical Trailer.

60,3xHCCH,"""The Hangover"" meets ""Back to the Future"": Raunchy Version",5,11 April 2010,"With a title like ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" there was definitely no illusions that this would be an Oscar-quality movie. Expectations were so low, that you may actually enjoy this erratic raunchy comedy.HTTM follows the sad-sack lives of three losers Adam, Nick and Lou (played by John Cusack, Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry respectively). After Lou tries to kill himself, the three friends decide to take a trip to Kodiak Valley, a ski resort where they spent memorable times 20 years back. While having a debauched dip in the hot tub, some illegal Russian energy drink caused short circuitry in the space-time continuum, the three were transported back to their 1986 heyday.In this whole movie, I only knew John Cusack, the rest of the cast were not exactly known to me. Cusack played it mainly straight here, and let Robinson, and especially Corddry ham it up in the funnier and uncomfortably nastier sequences. Clark Duke plays Cusack's nerdy nephew Jacob. He was mainly there to get the zany group in focus on how to get back to the present, but he also learned a thing or two about himself in this trip.As you can deduce, the comedy style here is raunchy 80s teen sex comedy. Yes, even with those middle-aged lead stars. Foul language, boobs, free sex and drugs abound, not everyone's cup of tea. Despite that, guys my age would have fun with the many visual and aural references to the 1980s. The fantastic music soundtrack is particularly fun to hear and identify with, anachronistic as some tracks may be.Time travel movies are always expected to have big loop holes due to the effects of the events in the time-space continuum. That is especially true with this one which takes great big liberties with the ""rules' of time-travel. You simply know you should not try to alter events, right? Wait till you see what happens in this movie. Haha! Just enjoy the ride and leave all logic at the door. It can be fun, really.",Hot Tub Time Machine

Now they've got a chance to re-live some of the same events they experienced the first time around when they were younger, though they must try and duplicate exactly what happened to them at the time in order not to screw up their present conditions (or something like that). This is nothing more or less than your typical outrageous comedy of the day and it's not very unique, though the characters have a pretty good chemistry together. It's Rob Corddry's wildly unethical loser who steals the show, however. Speaking as someone around the same age as the guys in this film, I don't recall the year 1986 to be all that substantially different from 2010, once you get past the Internet and cell phones. This might have been something else if the cast were tossed back to the early '70s instead.

Three old friends ,plus one young dude go on a skiing trip to relieve the glory days of the 80's literally. Me, growing up in the 80's I could relate to this. John Cusack gives this pretty much instant credibility and is great as the lead. The support cast did good too and each represents a different social class, which makes them unlikely friends, but represents the decade pretty well.

In this day and age it takes real comedy chops to pull off poo and vomit gags with such expert timing. The film embraces the absurdity of time travel and doesn't focus too much on the whys. All four of the male leads are brilliant, especially Corddry, who pulls off one of the great movie arseholes, without completely detaching himself from the audience. There are some classic lines, mostly coming from insults, and the film doesn't rely too much on date humour (just a few references to e-mail etc.) It cleverly spits in the face of the butterfly effect and relishes its characters manipulation of time, whilst showing that some things can't be avoided.

These four actors are decent, but I feel John Cusack is more believable in suspense or action movies than in this kind of comedy. The rest of the cast is ordinary, with exception of Rob Corddry who is really funny playing an old man with a teenager's mind. It's sad that sometimes it is too much similar to ""The Hangover"", and frustrating that most of the scenes are boring and uninteresting.

In ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", the Achilles heel here is based on intentions. What is it trying to be? A feel-good tickle your funny-bone comedy, or a film to search for one's youth? Is it a story about forgetting your past and accepting what one has now? Or is it a nostalgic trip down Memory Lane about how your friends in the past don't connect with the friends you have today? Is it all I've aforementioned? None of it? Where the hell's the direction in this movie?The old story of traveling back in periods in time have been done a plethora of times before (""Back to the Future"" is still the best time traveling flick ever), ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" offers very little in terms of originality or plot. The acting spectrum was overall impressive with John Cusack leading the pack doing a fine job of what's given to him, which really doesn't say much in terms by the drab direction. In order for a person to understand the gags, jokes and quips requires that you had to either have lived in the 1980's or you must have a better comprehension of 1980's culture. My childhood was in the 1980's but even some of the lingo was puzzling to me. Maybe I should have lived my teen years in the 1980's to get the jokes delivered here. There were also numerous aspects of the movie that didn't sit very well with me. For instance the lovable John Cusack getting high seems so forced and contrived. Or Craig Robinson screaming at his future wife who was 9 years old in 1986. Or if that wasn't banal how about Rob Corddry making out with Cusack's sister with Cusack not too far away and listens to every moan and grind. If you thought this was going to be a light-hearted comedy, well perish the thought.This comedy is darker than a shadow during a blackout.And when all the smoke clears, we the audience are left expecting the characters show a bit of sympathy for each other and that they should forget about the past and move on with their lives. Well that didn't happen either. Overall an unsatisfying outing for me in this one.",Hot Tub Time Machine
67,Sandcooler,Fantastic 80s throwback,8,1 January 2014,"Is there such a thing as a good miscast? If so, putting John Cusack in this kind of buddy comedy is pure genius. He's done some lighter stuff before (""Grosse Point Blank"", ""High Fidelity""), but even those movies were classy and intellectual. This movie definitely isn't, but that's one of its main strengths. It's a raunchy movie, but a very well-written one. There are so many comedies around that just throw as many bodily fluids as possible at the screen and see what happens, this movie always keeps its focus on the (flimsy) plot and strikes when you least expect it. It's not quite as predictable as the average Hollywood comedy, particularly the ending is surprisingly inventive. The most fun part though is how well this pays tribute to the 80s. The atmosphere is captured perfectly, and it helps that they're at a skiing resort (home of pretty much every 80s comedy ever) and get bullied by a villain who's such an amazing cliché of the era that you really start to wonder if that hot tub might actually work. Probably the best 80s comedy 2010 can give you.",Hot Tub Time Machine
68,Matt_Layden,Great White Buffalo....,8,9 June 2010,"3 friends and one of their nephews go to a ski resort to get away from their boring lives and to try help one that almost committed suicide by accident. The resort isn't what they remembered, it's almost in shambles. They do find a hot tub though and upon entering it get completely wasted and spill some foreign energy drink on the controls, sending them back in time to the 80's. Thinking they can't do anything to change the past or they will screw up the future. Thus, they try to recreate the events that happened back then and try to find a way home before it's too late.The title alone is what I think got a lot of people interested in the film, it's totally ridiculous and perfect for this style of comedy. The film even plays a joke on the title when one of the lead characters looks right into the camera and says ""It must be some kind of...Hot Tub Time Machine"". With nudity, drugs, cursing and a lot of sexual and crude jokes, Hot Tub Time Machine manages to stay funny throughout, something I found very surprising. As much as I like the Judd Apatow comedy troupe and their films, it's always refreshing to see a different comedy actually be funny and work. The cast is an odd one, John Cusack plays Adam, the straight laced guy who finally let's loose when he is stuck in the 80's. Craig Robinson is Nick, the married one from the group and Rob Corddry is Lou, the self proclaimed asshole of the group. Clark Duke is Jacob, Adams nephew. He tags along for the trip because he is staying at Adam's house while his mom lives with her new boyfriend, whom he hates. The young actor manages to keep up with the older gents and even though may seem out of place at first, fits in as the film rolls on. Speaking of being out of place, John Cusack doesn't seem like he would be in this type of film, it's nice to see him play against type, sort to speak. He plays his usual self, just not in his usual self film. If you know what I mean. Corddry and Robinson play their roles perfectly and are the two highlights of the film, sharing the funniest scene involving a bet gone wrong and a bathroom. I won't go into the time travel properties of the film, it doesn't for one second try to explain or even attempt to have a serious thought about the state of time travel. This isn't Back To The Future, even though George McFly himself has a supporting role here. As long as you can get pass the implausibility of the plot, you'll be fine. You should be able to judge that yourself by the trailer...or even the film's title.Some minor problems involving characters for me though. Why does the reporter take a liking to Adam? Why was Chevy Chase so cryptic and did he really exist? These things are minor gripes on my end and if you are going into this film just wanting to laugh and not give two craps about that sort of thing, then you'll be able to overlook these details. It's definitely a teen comedy with an R rating. Sometimes it's fun to laugh at immature things. I can see the film having a cult following. It seems to stand in the shadow of last years The Hangover, but people shouldn't be comparing the two. The only thing the two share in common is a drunken aftermath of problems. See the flick with friends on a Friday night and you will enjoy yourself. If you like comedy that involves oral sex, foul language, a man crying while having sex, and Chevy Chase, you'll be fine. If not, just look to the future.",Hot Tub Time Machine

We're not in deep, artistic territory, here. Sure, there's a few half-hearted attempts at messages about friendship and destiny threaded throughout the story, but really, no one is watching this for that. All I expected from the movie was for it to be funny. Did it deliver? Yes, but not quite as well as I hoped.Parts of the movie are hilarious. But then, several minutes would go by where I was almost bored. Rob Corddry gets the majority of the funny scenes, with his fellow actors being more hit-or-miss. I've seen Clark Duke being much funnier in other movies (Sex Drive, for example), Cusack is used more to drive the story forward than for humor (though he does get a few laughs), and Craig Robinson's funniest scenes are all with Corddry. The story is completely silly and throw-away, but it provided an excuse for all the movie's zany situations to happen, and that's all that really matters. There are also a bevy of very attractive women to be seen (including Lizzie Caplan, who I had completely forgotten was in this), for guys like me who like a little eye candy to go along with their chuckles. I thought HTTM went on a little longer than it needed to. The ending was definitely too long, and a few minutes could have been shaved off of most of the subplots without the movie as a whole suffering. Still, this is a pretty decent comedy. Not one that you're going to be revisiting very often after you've seen it for the first time, but worth catching if you have some time to kill and are fans of the cast.",Hot Tub Time Machine
70,brando647,Funnier Than I Expected,7,27 July 2010,"John Cusack, Craig Robinson, and Rob Corddry are three friends whose lives have hit a low point. Adam (Cusack) was left by his girlfriend, Nick (Robinson) works in a dog fitness center and suspects his wife of infidelity, and Lou (Corddry) is a full-time loser. After Lou is suspected of attempting suicide, his friends plan a weekend in Kodiak Valley, a ski resort hangout from their youth. With Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), the four head out and find the Valley is in ruin, overrun with the elderly and smelling of cat urine. After a drunken night in the room's hot tub, the four awaken to find themselves in 1986 and realize they've been given the chance to do it all over again...or they could change the past to fix the future.I love a good retro comedy and this one is surprising well done. The film knows what it is, and relishes in the absurdity. It never tries to take itself seriously (which is obvious from the first scene in the film where Robinson pulls a set of BMW keys from a dog's butt). I think what I enjoy most is that the film uses the 80s era to enhance jokes rather than purely relying on the oddness that was the 80s to carry the humor. The funniest bit in the movie is a running gag involving the resort's bellhop and Lou's obsession with how he ends up losing his arm.I wouldn't have even watched this film if the cast hadn't caught my attention. Cusack is perpetually awesome in just about everything he does, and it was fun to see him go all out for a screwball comedy like this. Robinson's always a run supporting character actor, and Corddry manages to steal plenty of scenes with Lou's desperation to use his knowledge to change his future (particularly an instance when he tries to use his future knowledge to bet on football). I wasn't familiar with Clark Duke before this film but I can see him rising up and becoming a staple of the comedy scene. With some fun cameos from Chevy Chase as a mysterious hot tub repairman and Crispin Glover as the doomed bellhop, this movie was surprising funny and worth a viewing.",Hot Tub Time Machine
71,Troy_Campbell,Should make for a decently amusing night on the couch.,6,23 April 2010,"John Morris and Sean Anders' desultory screenplay is never too sure what it's meant to be. A gross-out comedy? The scene where Nick and Lou get really friendly due to a lost wager would suggest so. A humour-disguised drama about not allowing adulthood and responsibility get in the way of your dreams? That's what we get with the introspective conversations between Adam and April (Lizzy Caplan). Or is this just a high-concept comedy about the 'what-ifs' of time-travelling? It's not exactly clear.The scripting duo flit from one mood to another without a second thought, which proves to be a tad distracting and even more detaching. When genuine emotion enters the frame it is quickly cheapened by a spurt of sexual humour in the vein of American Pie. On the flip side, you will be laughing away at those very same gags when suddenly it takes a break to fit in a slice of drama. Perhaps if they had stuck by their guns one way or the other HTTM would have been a much more rounded affair, as it is you'll walk out of the cinema almost instantly forgetting what you just saw but feeling satisfied none-the-less.The major highlight of this film is undoubtedly the cast, led by the always reliable Cusack. His Adam is the lynchpin for the other, more eccentric characters, but they can't offer the same level of class as Joan's brother. Robinson plays his big teddy bear role well once again (after Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, Zack and Miri Make a Porno), but he's further typecast himself in that role by doing so. As the younger member of the quartet Duke is terrifically sarcastic and nerdy as Jacob, this providing a nice one-two punch alongside his recent role in Kick-Ass. Playing the loud and obnoxious Lou, Corddry occasionally goes too far but for the most part offers up plenty of laughs. To round things out there is a nifty supporting turn by the quirky Glover and a nice wink-wink-nudge-nudge cameo by Chase.Not worth seeing at the cinema, but should make for a decently amusing night on the couch once released on DVD.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Hot Tub Time Machine

73,oneguyrambling,"Likable, but not too much more than a dumb-clever title.",6,17 December 2010,"After the recent cinematic miscarriage that was MacGruber it was with some trepidation that I ventured into another deliberately cheesy, potentially throwaway comedy in HTTM. This film was better yet still left a lot on the table, but at least for the main part it tried.John Cusack is Adam, a recently dumped nobody who has a 20 year old computer nerd nephew living in his basement and who has fallen out of touch with the friends he grew up with. That changes when one of them named Lou is thought to have attempted suicide one night. So Adam and Nick (Craig Robinson) decide to organize an impromptu ""Boy's Weekend"" away in the snowfields to shake Lou loose from his funk. The nephew Jacob also tags along, despite Lou openly detesting him and treating his as a 5th wheel.Once they arrive at the snow the gents find that the place that was such a paradise in their youth is no longer such a hoppin' place. Their old room from 20 + years ago is run down, the locals are more detached than pleased to see them and their one-armed bellhop is apathetic and openly aggressive And there is a dead raccoon decomposing in the hot tub.The boys spend the first day trying to force a high of sorts, resorting to alcohol, pointless boasting and recalling the feats of better days when they ruled the roost. That evening though as things threaten to deteriorate to the point where it becomes irredeemable the Hot Tub suddenly fires into action, and the boys hold an impromptu nekkid hot tub party that rocks thru the night.In the AM they all head out into the snow, feeling amazingly rejuvenated and capable of anything, only very shortly afterward they realize that it was no ordinary magic rejuvenation hot tub - it was a hot tub time machine.Aaaahhh. Of course it was! Adam, Nick and Lou all appear as their normal 30/40 something selves, to themselves. Everyone else sees them as the 1986 version when they were young and fit and 80s looking (and it must be said 100% acne and blemish free). Jacob is still the nerdy looking chubby 20 year old from before, only now he flickers on and off for some reason.Being (now) set in the 80s the extras all have big hair, day glo colours and bizarre outfits, there are also at least a dozen other films namechecked through this one for some reason.Hot Tub Time Machine inhabits the same orbit as Groundhog Day, only with nowhere near the same level of care and ultimately success. Once you swallow the fact that these guys are now in their late teens and are required to reenact events from their 1986 visit in order to get back to the present day then what follows should be a cinch. Only of course not everything goes to plan, some choose to do things a little different this time around with varying results.There are some disturbingly crude scenes and events that seem out of place and there just to get the ewwww factor up, which works more from an ewwww perspective than from a ha-ha that's funny perspective if you ask me. But ever since American Pie and Road Trip showed filmmakers that gay jokes and gross out stuff is apparently hilarious that is par for the course.The dialogue and jokes are often aggressive, crass, crude or a combination thereof. None of these things offend me at all but they don't necessarily guarantee a chuckle either.Most of the big subplot climaxes (of which there are many as every guy has one or more), involve sex or violence, and the laughter that comes from seeing clumsy doggy-style sex (just one example) quickly dissipates once you realize that was the joke. This was a film about out of touch near 40 year olds ""gettin' they groove back"" by being inexplicably transported back to their youth, I think if the same thing happened to me I might find many of the low brow highjinks a little funnier.I will give points for the fact that even while they they aimed low at least they managed to succeed, MacGruber couldn't even achieve that level of mediocrity.Final Rating – 6 / 10. I'm conflicted. I think I was entertained, but now 24 hours later I can't think of a single thing that I find amusing from the film. It's a begrudging 6/10. (I think I may regret this later if I watch it again, hope not.)",Hot Tub Time Machine

While partying in a hot tub, they wake up the next morning in the year 1986. They are visited by the mysterious Repair Man who gives them guidelines.

75,bobsgrock,"Cherish what you have, change what you can.",8,2 July 2010,"There is a powerful message within the confines of Hot Tub Time Machine, a film that makes no qualms about what it wants to be; yet what it ends up being makes it all the more enjoyable. On the surface it is a disgusting, gross-out comedy with tons of language, sex and drugs. That would be the part most people go to see a movie like this for. What I decided to see it for is the amount of heart and warmth in a film like this.Most comedies in general don't have any at all, so we come to expect all of them to be the same way. However, director Steve Pink and writer Josh Anders show their willingness to go above and beyond what would be expected for a mediocre comedy and give us not just a significant amount of laughs but also a story with interesting, likable characters and something to do and say.The cast is excellent, led by the always-reliable John Cusack playing off his teen star charisma from the 1980s, Rob Corddry as the breakout star really giving us a good taste of his comedy chops, Craig Robinson who is quickly becoming one of the kings of the deadpan, and Clark Duke who continues to amaze and impress me with his steady presence and feeling he brings to all his performances. These four essentially make the movie, along with the very funny screenplay. There may not be laughs every single scene, but that's only because they are willing to slow down, take a breath, and talk and give us the story of these guys who hate their lives, realize they messed up, and now face a chance to change and make right what was once wrong. This is a situation we all would love to have, and since it is impossible thus far, we go to the movies to see how some might do it. I like the way these guys handled it. A very funny movie with a sweet, tender side as well.",Hot Tub Time Machine
76,napierslogs,"For all its ridiculousness and asshole-ness, it's still fun and enjoyable",6,28 July 2010,"""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is actually quite enjoyable. The ridiculous title and its obvious concept turned me off at first but it turned out to be a lot of fun.As a fan of John Cusack, it was pleasing to see his character, Adam, reminiscent of Rob from ""High Fidelity"" (2000), especially when his girlfriend moved out on him at the very beginning. ""She basically called me an asshole, like I'm a narcissistic asshole."" His friend replies, ""Yeah, she has a point though."" The movie does spend a significant amount of time with the guys being assholes and calling each other assholes, but it is probably the best guys-acting-as-assholes movie.Three middle-aged men are despondent with the sad state of their lives, Rob Corddry being the worst of the bunch, is in the hospital with another not-suicide attempt (beause if he really wanted to, he would kick ass at killing himself), and Cusack and Craig Robinson are called in as the only people who could be described as his friends. Believe it or not, but the movie's opening with all this unhappiness is quite funny and real at the same time. To cheer themselves up, they are off to a ski resort where they used to hang out in the 80s. I think we all know why it's called ""Hot Tub Time Machine"".As ridiculous and inane as this all sounds, there is a lot of clever humour in the movie, and the characters, as much as they are assholes, they are also real and genuine. I know them and that just makes them all the more fun. I was annoyed with the inclusion of Jacob (Clark Duke) as Cusack's nephew because I think one Jonah Hill is enough.",Hot Tub Time Machine

78,hall895,A blast in the past,7,2 July 2012,"Four men, each with reason to be unsatisfied with the state of their lives in 2010, get into a hot tub and are transported back in time to 1986. Three of the men will relive one of the most memorable weekends of their lives. Not memorable for particularly happy reasons though. Meanwhile the fourth guy, the young nephew of one of the other three, has to ensure the group doesn't screw up the space-time continuum and erase him from existence. Because in 1986 he hadn't been born yet. And then he runs into his mom. And there's Crispin Glover! Why it's just like that other time-travel movie! Well no, this movie is not nearly as good as that one. The movie's title should be enough to let you know that this is not meant to be taken particularly seriously. This is just about having a little fun. And in that aim this movie succeeds.So the setup is rather silly. Really, the whole movie is rather silly. But silly can be entertaining. The laughs come, if not fast and furious, at least consistently enough to keep you entertained. And while the movie certainly has its vulgar moments it never takes it too far. The movie goes right up to the edge but never quite over it, enabling it to maintain its charm. Yes, charm. A movie titled Hot Tub Time Machine actually has some charm to it. In addition to making you laugh the movie actually makes you feel for each of the four main characters and sympathize with the dilemmas with which they are faced. Yeah, it's just a silly comedy but it does have a little heart to it. And each of the actors does very well with their respective parts. John Cusack is more or less the straight man, his character of Adam the most buttoned-down and mundane of the group. Clark Duke plays Adam's nephew Jacob, tasked with trying to rein these guys in and get them all back to 2010 before he ceases to exist. Craig Robinson is very funny playing the would-be musician Nick. And the real standout is Rob Corddry playing the alcoholic train-wreck Lou. All the actors have their moments but Corddry definitely gets the biggest laughs. There's also Chevy Chase playing a mysterious, eccentric hot tub repairman. Speaking of eccentric, there's the aforementioned Glover playing a bellhop facing a grisly destiny. And Lizzy Caplan playing a girl you'd love to have a future with if you weren't stuck in the past. These supporting players add to the mix but it's really all about our gang of four. It's their story. Yes it's a silly story but that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable. Don't take it seriously. Don't think too much about the goings-on because there are plot holes big enough to drive, say, a DeLorean through. Just enjoy it. It's a great 1980s nostalgia trip. Poison! ALF! A black Michael Jackson! And it's a movie that makes you laugh and keeps you smiling. Sometimes that's all you can ask. When a movie is titled Hot Tub Time Machine there is no pretense about it. It is what it is. What it is isn't bad at all.",Hot Tub Time Machine
79,jon.h.ochiai,Trust the Universe,8,3 April 2010,"In ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" 40-something guys go back to 1986 in a hot tub time machine. Frazzled Nick (hysterical Craig Robinson) notices that a dude is listening to a cassette player, and some other dude is sporting jheri curls. Nick grabs a girl and asks her, ""What color is Michael Jackson?"" She answers, ""Black?"" Nick runs out the door screaming, ""Ahhhhhh!"" At that point I was in with ""Hot Tub Time Machine"". ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is crass, offensive, messy, and really funny. It is not nearly as cleverly written as ""The Hangover"". Writers Josh Heald, Sean Anders, and John Morris take a buckshot comedy approach: they fire out a lot of jokes. A few of them land—what lands is funny and hysterical at times. Director Steve Pink does well by maintaining a frenetic pace, because the gimmick is thin. Come on: It is about a Hot Tub Time Machine. At the cheesy catharsis Nick (Robinson) says, ""It must be some kind of hot tub time machine."" John Cusack as Adam leads his band of friends Nick (Robinson), Lou (manic Rob Corddry), along with his 20 year old nephew Jacob (brilliantly nerdy Clark Duke) in revisiting their youth. The guys run into Adam's teen ho-like sister Kelly (whacked out Collette Wolfe). Here Director Pink and the trio of writers through Cusack realize that their lives still ""really sucked"" in 1986. Poignant is unexpected in this raucous romp. The crew attempts to alter the future. However, Adam still gets stabbed in the eye and dumped by Jennie (vapidly hot Lyndsy Fonseca). Nick calls his future wife, who is now 9 years old, pleading her not to cheat on him in the future. Lou gets his butt kicked by lame ski patrol bullies. And Jacob freaks out in possible threesome with Lou. All the while their guide to the past is the Repair Man (Chevy Chase)—the God character of the tale. Chase does not have much to do. The time travel phenomena may be linked to a Russian energy drink. You have to see the movie.The story is very messy and kluged. But there are enough hysterics to keep it going. There is gross out scene where Lou loses a bet and is about to perform a nasty on Nick. Lou exclaims, ""Gary Coleman's forearm."" Robinson is awesome singing, ""Jessie's Girl""—unfortunately this could have gone longer. To ensure the future Adam must endure hearing his sister having sex. Cusack's expression is priceless and extremely uncomfortable. The running jokes with Crispin Glover's bellhop grow on you exponentially hilariously.Ultimately, Cusack makes this all worth watching. He has fun with his own '80s star image homage—the master straight man. I bought Adam meeting ""the one"" in quirky and cute Lizzy Caplan as Rolling Stone writer April covering the band Poison. Caplan along with Cusack ground this swirling mess. I loved when Cusack's Adam tells April that he now trusts the universe. April tells him, ""I hope the universe brings us back together."" ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is sloppy, funny, and could have been better written. However, it gets an ""A"" for effort, and for having a lot of heart. Everything will work out. You have to trust the universe.",Hot Tub Time Machine
80,TOMASBBloodhound,Better than I could ever have imagined.,8,12 December 2010,"When you make a movie called ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", and the plot is actually about such a device, you'd better damn well make sure its funny. And luckily for most viewers looking for a Hangover-type movie, this one also delivers plenty of laughs. In fact I recall laughing much more at this than the Hangover. The film is full of raunchy humor and crude situations, but this has become common place these days. What makes some of these films actually worth watching is that some of them are also preceptive on certain levels. Hot Tub Time Machine is certainly more than a raunch fest.Just having John Cusak as your star is a nice connection to the 1986 when the majority of this story takes place. The plot involves three men mired in the suffocating grasp of middle-age and one's hipster nephew taking a trip back in time through you guessed it... a hot tub that can transport people through the continuum if a certain illegal Russian alcho-pop is poured into its controls. Once these guys realize what has happened, they naturally go through the motions of trying to make sure they don't accidentally alter the past to screw up the future. But this idea is quickly chucked after the older three realize things back in 2010 aren't so special anyway, so who really cares if things get screwed up. The hipster, whose actual existence hangs in the balance, doesn't see it that way and he has a heck of a time convincing the others to go back to the future with as little damage done as possible. All films dealing with time travel have rules about this and that. Luckily the script focuses mostly on laughs and actually ends up deserving its happy ending.Of course there are flaws with anachronisms here and there. The 1980s were a more diverse decade than they are remembered to be. And too often movies or shows spoofing that decade will include too many clichés happening at once. Here, other than some music that was included on the soundtrack a few years too early, the film mostly plays by the rules. 1986 was about as 1980s as you could get. Still, the song Smooth Up In Ya by the Bullet Boys did not come out until 1989. Loved the Poison and Motley Crue songs and references, though. I was almost saddened by the inclusion of a Black Eyed Peas performance in one scene. Look at how far we've fallen in music taste since back then.One of the more interesting ponderings I had between laughs dealt with the human aging process and how it could differ so greatly in two individuals. How can Crispin Glover look and act EXACTLY the same as he did in 1986, while Chevy Chase now looks like an AARP member??? Come on Chevy! You were Ty Webb! You were Fletch!

82,itamarscomix,Lazy,4,10 November 2012,"The makers of Hot Tub Time Machine were apparently under the impression that making enough references to the 80's is enough to appease their target audience, so much so that, as long as you cast some cult stars from the 80's like John Cusack and Chevy Chase (in a completely disposable role) to drive the point home, there's no need for any other type of humor. It's interesting to note that writer Josh Heald - and in all likelihood most of the film's fan base - was not in his early 50's when writing it, like the protagonists, but rather in his early 80's; which means that he was a child in the mid-80's, and therefore has no real memories of clubbing and dating in the 80's, but rather memories of watching movies about people clubbing and dating in the 80's - people played by John Cusack, in all likelihood. That's probably why the references are as broad and as cliché as humanly possible - these are references not to the 80's but to the 80's as they are portrayed in film, so that the jokes could be understood by the 18-30 age demographic which are likely to make for a lot of the audience - Michael Jackson is black! Cellphones are huge! Ronald Reagan is president! Beneath all that, there's an attractive premise and a very poorly made and lazily written comedy. There have been quite a few time-travel based buddy comedies before - From Bill & Ted to FAQ About Time Travel, both of which had more heart and more wit than this dud. A new time travel comedy needs to bring something new to the table, and Hot Tub Time Machine does not. It pretends to be a self-aware genre-buster - what with the protagonists knowingly dropping the film's title several times throughout while breaking the fourth wall - but the fact is that most of the humor is the laziest, broadest, most obvious and predictable kind of slapstick, gross out and sexual humor. There's nothing to make it memorable or even entertaining, other than a talented group of actors who are clearly having fun and making it at least watchable. It's a shame though that John Cusack seems to have more fun with the film than both the director and the audience.",Hot Tub Time Machine

It definitely had its funny moments especially with the bellhop and the arm issue, that was really funny. It was also great having the old 80's vibes back, but I felt the film was lacking in the fun areas. If you end up going back in time, and your life sucks in the current time line, would you not try to change the past? Would that not be the main goal? Instead the majority of the film was about not changing anything and making the same pathetic mistakes over again. Where's the fun in that? Was it to show me where these guys went wrong in life and how much of loosers they were from the start? Boring. With that said it finally did pick up near the end of the film, the characters finally threw the playbook out and went for it, but it took way too long to get there. The other thing that didn't match up was putting John Cusack and Lizzy Caplan together, she out shines him one-hundred to one. He's so dull and reserved with no energy where she's like a a super hot wild child down playing her energy trying not to over shine him.

A story of male bonding through alcohol, sex and fighting other boys.HTTM tells the story of a group of friends who, after the suicide attempt of one them, decide to go to the place they had the most fun and were most happy when they were young - the Kodiak Valley Ski Resort. After a night of heavy drinking, the spa tub in which they are having a bath brings them to the same place, but in the 80s -OMG!-, when they were still young full of libido, dreams and enemies. In fact, the movie combines elements that belong to Back to the Future, Peggy Sue got Married, and the Hangover, among other movies.Hot Tub Machine is one of those senseless movies full of sex scenes, nudity, cursing, and common cheekiness, even vulgarity at times. Despite everything, the film has a joyful tone, lack of pretensions, and has extremely likable characters, so you end having a healthy laugh despite all its flaws.The acting is uneven. John Cusack is OK in his portray of the apathetic divorcée Adam. Clark Duke is good as the young social-network-bred gadget-full shy teen Adam's nephew Jacob. Craig Robinson is OK as the sweet insecure ex-rock band singer turned dog-spa caretaker Nick, while Rob Corddry is also good as the heavy drinker, sex obsessed but faithful friend Lou.

92,kirk-246,Hot tub+Time machine=100 minutes of pure fun.,9,10 April 2010,"A movie such as ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" hardly comes along.This is the type of comedy that escapes from the real world and becomes it's own movie.That's why this movie works so well as a raunchy and funny look at time travel and not to mention hot tubs.So forget those bad expectations you might be having all because of the plot.We hardly get a movie like this, so just sit back and enjoy the ride.There's no reason to explain the plot of the movie.Given the title, all you need to know that the movie is about 4 guys who get in a hot tub and they wake up in the year 1986.Simple as that.If you like hot tubs and time travel and you want to see an unusual but very fun combination, this one's all for you.If you don't like hot tubs and time travel and you think the combination is just plain stupid, go see this movie for yourself and maybe you'll change your mind.I know I did.",Hot Tub Time Machine
93,kdnor2011,Pretty Funny,8,17 August 2010,"Talk about a shocker, I did not think I would like this movie. I had no plans to see this. I was born in the 90s, so the 80s were before my time, I'm not a big John Cusack fan, and the plot seemed more weird then it did charming. My dad bought the DVD, and to see what all the fuss was about, I watched it, and it was pretty damn funny.The plot was good, the characters were harlarious, the premise was so stupid it had to work, and it was very entertaining. I think I might actually like John Cusack in this movie more than I did in 2012.The plot is exactly what you would expect from a movie like this. Three dudes in their fortys go back to a ski resort they went to as college kids. There, along with Cusack's nephew they travel back to the 80's with a Hot Tub Time Machine.It's stupid, but it's funny.",Hot Tub Time Machine

95,nickmesafilms,Hot Tub Time Machine (2010) - What Color is Michael Jackson? Black! AHH!,8,25 November 2011,"""Hot Tub Time Machine"" already has a hilarious premise just by looking at the awesome title. I don't think it's hard to understand. The movie is just about a bunch of guys who enter a hot tub, get drunk, and the next thing you know, the hot tub is actually a time machine that just send you to 1986. Now, these guys have to relive every moment to fix the space-time continuum, so they can get back to the present, and that's when everything goes haywire. A raunchy and flawless script, and a super cast is a few of the ingredients needed to make ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" a really great movie. There's always a laugh to be had, everything is well-written in such a nasty way, and watching it was like reliving the time of the 80s. John Cusack was super awesome, Clark Duke was super funny, Rob Corddry is super cool, Craig Robinson was super great, and rounding out the cast is Crispin Glover (awesome), Lizzy Caplan (loved her a lot), and the incredible Chevy Chase! So, honestly there was nothing bad about the movie, because this is one of the more better movies of 2010. Every moment is funny, the cast is golden, and I'm the type of comedy/sci-fi fan. I loved ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", it's purpose to be a movie is freaking hilarious. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"", in my review, ""laugh-out-loud enjoyment, a must-see for comedy lovers"".",Hot Tub Time Machine
96,Jackpollins,The Hangover With A Hot Tub,10,27 March 2010,"Ignore the title, ignore the trailers, and go see this film. Despite the moronic, ludicrous title as well as some awful trailers and an other worldly plot, Hot Tub Time Machine exceeded, if not amazed my expectations. The film's plot all starts when Lou (Rob Corddry) gets drunk and hospitalized when he passes out in his car. His friends Adam (John Cusack) & Nick (Craig Robinson) visit him. It is then that, along with Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) that they visit a ski lodge from their teenage years. They get in a hot tub, and travel back to the 80's. Hello, clever 80's references. Yes, I'm serious. If you can suspend all your beliefs of a plot, you will enjoy all the references to 80's. It includes great music like Save It For Later by The English Beat and Talk Dirty To Me by Poison, and other songs I will not bother to list. The film especially has fun with teen John Cusack, referencing his teen version from High Fidelity. Overall, Hot Tub Time Machines has a lot of great 80's references. I mean, where else can you hear Darryl from The Office say lines like ""It must be some kind of hot tub time machine"" and ""That dude's rocking a cassette player"". The film also features a great running gag with a bellhop named Phil (Crispin Glover) who was angry in the 2000's because he had lost his arm but is a nice guy in the 80's because he has both arms, and Nick & Lou waiting for him to lose his arm. The film also features a very funny Chevy Chase as a repairman who can't give a straight answer. It's as funny as The Hangover, and it features the addition of a hot tub. I don't know about you, but I'd say that's a movie worth seeing.",Hot Tub Time Machine
97,Meven_Stoffat,Hot Tub Time Machine will make you want to time travel so you can see it again!,6,11 March 2010,"I first heard of this movie back in January of this year. I thought it sounded funny, but one I wouldn't pay to see in the theater. Then I saw the trailer, I thought it looked funny, and I decided ""Eh, why not go see it? Should be good"". Then my friend got an advance showing ticket and he invited me. I thought, ""hey it's a free advance showing, go for it!"" So I did. So anyways, that was a week ago today.Tonight was the screening of the movie. And boy, did I love it or what! This is definitely a movie I would pay to go see again in the theater. From its stellar cast to its substantial amount of crude and gross humor, this is a film that is rude, crude, and unabashedly vulgar- and proud of it. And it's another roller-coaster comedy- the moment you think it'll get boring, it throws even bigger laughs your way. So in that sense, I can definitely say that I am glad I went. It was one hell of a hilarious comedy that kept me laughing.After a stint that almost gets a person killed, his friends who are also unfortunately living rock bottom lives invite him to go on a road trip up to a snowy alpine town named Kodiak Valley, taking one's nephew. The town is practically desolate, and the hotel room is crappy. However, they find out their suite has a hot tub, and they get pretty trashed. Unknowingly, they knock over an energy drink and spill it on the panel.The next morning, they wake up, but things aren't what they seem. For one, everyone's wearing fashion that was made big in the eighties. there's only one logical explanation: The hot tub was a time machine that transported them back to 1986!!!! However, since 3 of them are adults, they also discover they traveled to the day they went there for the Winterfest music festival with Poison headlining. So they decide to re-live the night they'll forever remember, while simultaneously trying to get back to 2010, ending up in several sticky situations along the way! This was a fun movie for sure. It was totally odd yet hilarious. Tons of belly laughs, lots of WTF moments. Cusack sure didn't ruin his career with this one- he is very funny and he proved he can take on a rude and crude comedy very well. Crispin Glover has a small role here, and he really did the deed here too. But, the real star of the show here is someone I usually dislike- Rob Cordry. He stole the show greatly here. He was the real highlight here. He was consistently funny through and had me laughing so hard to the point I couldn't breathe.However, I recommend that you do NOT let kids see this movie. The jokes, as I mentioned are rude and crude and extremely vulgar which almost push an NC-17 rating here. There's tons of sex jokes as well and couple ugly sex scenes that do nothing but add hilarity to the movie. The ending also takes a direction that most comedies nowadays don't. You expect the cliché comedy ending but you get something here that you are NOT expecting at all, so it gob-smacks you. I wasn't expecting it, and it made the experience even funnier for me.In short, this was an amazing experience that is not for the squeamish and definitely not for the prudish. And I for sure will see it again when it gets released I will see it again for sure.",Hot Tub Time Machine
98,D_Burke,Goofy Comedy Destined To Be A Cult Classic,8,5 May 2010,"""Hot Tub Time Machine"" has not gotten stellar reviews since it has been released, and has underperformed at the box office. It hasn't bombed, but it made far less money than it was expected to. Many people attributed this effect to the film having a weak premise that didn't live up to its very cool name, like ""Snakes on a Plane"". The problem with the aforementioned 2006 bomb was that it was initially advertised as a parody of disaster/action movies of the 90's and the 2000s, but it ended up being just as cliché and underwhelming as the movies it was supposed to be making fun of. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" promises nothing, and, as a result, is what it is: goofy, funny, and an incredibly enjoyable movie experience that will, like ""Office Space"", ""Super Troopers"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Wet Hot American Summer"" before it, find a cult audience via DVD very soon.The film follows three guys in their early 40's as their careers, love lives, and basically everything else in their lives are at a standstill. John Cusack is Adam, a guy who has been dumped by another girlfriend and has his nerdy, hermetic nephew Jacob (Clark Duke, who also co-starred in ""Kick-Ass"") living in his basement. Craig Robinson, a regular on ""The Office"" who has also played bit parts in other comedies, is Nick, a failed musician who now works in a pet store. Rob Corddry of ""The Daily Show"" is Lou, a recently-divorced wild man who accidentally poisons himself in a hilarious scene involving Styx and his car's exhaust pipe.To get away from it all, the four guys take a trip to what used to be a popular ski resort in the 1980's when they were in their 20's (except Jacob, who wasn't even born yet), but is now a ramshackle hotel in a run down neighborhood. When they get to their hotel, they find the hot tub works. They spend the night in the hot tub getting wasted, while Lou accidentally spills a Russian energy drink onto the electric tub settings pad. Rather than electrocuting them, it sends all four of them back 24 years ago.The parts where they slowly begin to realize they have traveled back in time are among the funniest in the film. I laughed out loud when Robinson asks a random girl if Michael Jackson is black or white. Of course, he could have asked her if he is dead or alive, but the reaction would not have been as funny.I also liked how the film eliminated the big plot hole usually associated with time travel films. Namely, if you've traveled back in time, how could you successfully get around without your past self seeing your future self? The way the film made the time travelers their past selves was really cool, especially the scene where they see their younger selves in the mirror.That's not to say all the elements of time travel in this movie were not confusing. I was a little confused as to what the purpose was of the hot tub repairman, played here by Chevy Chase. That confusion may have had to do with Chase showing up at very random times, plus he seemed to mumble all of his lines. I did not know what he was saying half the time, and it seems as though he really wasn't given very much to do. Chase was, unfortunately, the biggest letdown of the movie, because he has been in great comedies that are still considered classics today, but he was completely useless and incoherent here.Fortunately, there was enough entertaining material here to compensate for the inevitable plot holes. There were some great running gags (like Crispen Glover and his risky ventures with his arm) and a surprisingly intriguing love story between Cusack and ""Rolling Stone"" journalist April, played here by Lizzy Caplan (who I initially thought was Rashida Jones at first, but that's another story). Usually love stories weigh a movie, particularly a comedy, down considerably, but Cusack and Caplan had great chemistry together (despite Cusack being roughly 20 years her senior), and you were rooting for them to get together in the end. I won't tell you if they did.Also, Corddry and Robinson had some very funny lines that I still find myself laughing at. Although they have taken thankless supporting roles in movies in the past, I bet you will find them in starring roles very soon. Clark Duke didn't have it easy playing the straight man to these funny characters, but he held his own as the fulcrum of the story who accounts for how and why these characters should be transported back to 2010. Duke had his funny moments too, especially when he meets his inebriated mom in the past.""Hot Tub Time Machine"" will be a cult favorite, and is one of those films that I may find myself watching more than once. I also have the feeling that phrases like ""The Great White Buffalo"" will soon find themselves in the popular vernacular. Overall, though, this movie had me and the audience I saw it with laughing out loud, and I'm sure a few thousand other movie fans will join us soon.",Hot Tub Time Machine

100,tnrcooper,Entertaining but plot holes the size of a 1985 cell phone,6,25 February 2011,"This movie is mindless (and I do mean MINDLESS) fun. I only criticize it coz it really could have been mindlessly funny without being so full of colossal plot holes. It didn't need to ignore the inconsistencies which it did ignore about the bearing that choosing to do things in 1986 would have on the future. The fact that no one in 1986 could see the characters as they actually existed, annoyed me. If the movie had addressed these problems, it wouldn't have been so hard to do. It could have been a movie about fishes out of water and they could still have dealt with the things they had to deal with. That said, if you can ignore these massive plot holes and you don't mind gross-out humor, the movie is quite entertaining. Rob Corddry is very funny as the a-hole friend who is tolerated because he's been a friend for a long time. Craig Robinson is great as the loyal husband who is thrust into a moral dilemma (which really isn't, if an accurate understanding of time travel was featured) when they travel back in time. John Cusack is the straight-man/everyman type among the group, whose job while going back to the past is to break up with a girl. Again, the failure to accurately frame the past (Cusack is constantly considering the feelings of his future self although a past Cusack would have no knowledge of his future thoughts) takes away from the sense of the movie. Clark Duke is the youngster who has a lot of sense and is always dogged by Corddry's character.This is an enjoyable movie as said, but it could have been so so much more.",Hot Tub Time Machine
101,GirishGowda,"Ridiculous, Raunchy and Fun",7,29 July 2010,"What a stupid title for a John Cusack movie! John Cusack doesn't steal the limelight, instead everybody is given an equal chance to shine. When the opening scene had Nick putting his hands inside a dog, you know that what kind of a movie this will be. The characters quickly establish themselves as 'assholes' and if you can get over the initial nauseating feeling, you are in for a fun ride. I am a big fan of John Cusack and he has not let me down most of the times and he is a good bet to take. If you liked 'The Hangover', then you are going to love 'Hot Tub Time Machine'. The movie is very raunchy, over the top and gross, but in a good way. The chemistry between the main characters is spectacular. The music score is superb, so is the acting. Authenticity and common sense is thrown out the window, but just enjoy in this Hot Tub folks.In the year 2010, Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson) and Lou (Rob Corddry) are three best friends living in Los Angeles, who have drifted apart from one another during the course of their lives. They all are disappointed in the way that they are living their lives now. Adam is getting dumped by yet another girlfriend, Nick is in a crappy job and his wife is cheating on him, while Lou is an alcoholic and hates everybody in his life. When Lou is admitted to the hospital for trying to commit suicide, which he vehemently denies, both Adam and Nick decide to relive their 80's in Kodiak Valley Ski Resort which were the best weekends of their lives. Jacob (Clark Duke), the nephew of Adam who happens to live in his uncle's basement, also gets dragged along to the K-Valley. But K-Valley is not what it used to be, it is now a run-down place which isn't that exciting. They go to The Great White Buffalo and are disappointed again to see the place in shambles. They get into the hot tub outside their room to relieve their stress and after a night of hardcore drinking, they find themselves transported back in time to 1986. They are worried that they would bump into their old selves, when they look at their reflections and see that they are their old selves. A weird old repairman tells them that they shouldn't change anything and do exactly the same thing that they did 20 years ago. Adam and Nick are in put in a quandary over this situation, while Lou thinks he can make this a profitable experience. But, can they get back to their lives in the present? What would I do if I was back in the 80's America? Well, I would start off by inventing Google, like they did and rip off today's popular music and make myself world famous. Well, one can dream, can't they? At least it doesn't have the moral that one shouldn't mess up their past, because honestly, who wouldn't take advantage knowing the things we know today? Adam and Nick are likable, whereas Lou is disgusting. Fun, but disgusting. Jacob is like the guy who nobody cares, he is the third wheel to the party. I didn't like him that much. They all behave like teens who are drunk. Coming from a bunch of 40 year olds, that was very entertaining. I loved the scene where Nick calls up his future wife and starts crying and cursing at her. She was only 9 years old and she didn't understand half the things he was saying! And the scene where Lou has to do something to Nick!! That was so f-ing hilarious. The women are just caricatures of the 80's where they are only thinking about drinking, dancing and sex all the time, and will jump into your bed if you are even remotely exciting. It also has one regular indie chick who does the usual routine stuff. The story is truly lame, but the screenplay and dialogues are great which make this a pretty good watch.7/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
102,RichardSRussell-1,"Boorishness Not My Idea of Comedy, But a Few Parts Worked OK",4,30 March 2010,"Hot Tub Time Machine (1:39, R) — 4 — Other: Comedy, 3rd string, originalThe present day finds Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson), and Lou (Rob Corddry) in their early 40s and pretty dissatisfied with how their lives have turned out so far. They were buddies when they were 18, but that was back in 1986, and they've grown apart since then. Lou still sees himself as a wild man, tho — the Violator, in fact — and damn near kills himself with exhaust fumes while drunkenly revving his sports car in a closed garage. This shakes the guys, and they get together to try to recapture some of that old magic by heading off to Silver Peaks Lodge in Kodiak Village, a picturesque ski resort that was home to some of their fondest childhood memories.Well, it used to be picturesque, anyway. It's fallen on hard times, symbolized by general ramshackleness and surly behavior from their 1-armed bellhop Phil (Crispin Glover). Rather than being cheered, they get even more depressed, until their attention is drawn to the glowing, bubbling hot tub out back. During an evening of drunken cavorting therein, they accidentally spill some Chernoblye Water in the tub's mechanism, and next thing they know they're back at Winterfest 86, a fact confirmed by asking a passerby ""What color is Michael Jackson?"". To each other, they look the same, but a glance in a mirror reveals that the rest of the world sees them as their 18-year-old selves.Along for the ride but physically unchanged is Adam's nephew Jake (Clark Duke), a nerd who'd been living in Adam's basement because his mom Kelly (Collette Wolfe) had just moved in with yet another boyfriend. She's never told Clark who his father is. Clark figures he's as close to an expert on time travel as they've got, because he writes Stargate fanfic. Not even close to being the ladies' man that the other guys fancy themselves to be, he's the closest thing to an adult in the bunch as the older guys decide to have a 2nd shot at drunken frat-boy behavior. He keeps warning them about the butterfly effect and not to change anything that they remember from before. Needless to say, if any of them followed his advice, there'd be no movie.There is much raunchiness and what I guess is supposed to pass for towel-snapping guy humor. Some of it is mildly funny, but this was supposed to be a comedy, and boorishness needs a tighter leash than this to successfully tickle my funny bone. Women are generally treated as disposable sex objects; altho Nick is deeply devoted to his wife, we barely see her on screen, but bimbettes are everywhere.Chevy Chase wanders thru from time to time costumed as a hot-tub repairman, dispensing delphic advice to no apparent purpose. Cusack gets above-the-title billing but was the dullest of the lot, mainly moping around doing a basset imitation. Corddry was evidently green-lighted to go over the top in the 1st 5 minutes and keep on going. Robinson and Duke give fairly sympathetic performances, but their characters seem out of place and mismatched with the others, which could have been played for yuks but just felt awkward.Still, the movie had its moments, so it ends up at the bottom of my ""up to you"" range.",Hot Tub Time Machine
103,colinrgeorge,"""Hot Tub Time Machine""",2,6 April 2010,"More so than with any other genre, I confess to being somewhat of a comedy snob. It's not that I have particularly highbrow taste, there's simply a very thin line separating what I find enjoyable and what I find intolerable. I will tell you that ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" falls squarely into the latter category, and to be honest, it's not even close to the line.Take a look at the title with me. I realize ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" has no delusions of grandeur. It's not about weaving a complex story, it's not about great performances, and it's not about smart direction. It exists for the sole purpose of making me laugh—and that's its crippling failure. The film is so absolutely flimsy that when a joke misses the mark, everything collapses. You're not looking at a beautiful image, you're not engrossed in the story, and if you're not even laughing, then there's truly nothing to behold.Personally, I'm more inclined to laugh at situations and characters I understand and am invested in. While Mike Judge's ""Extract"" wasn't a great film, the director and his cast created three-dimensional performances, and I was content to watch them work even when they weren't making me LOL. ""Hot Tub,"" on the other hand, defines its characters with a single cliché: narcissist, asshole, married guy, weirdo (Jeez, that sounds familiar)—and spends all of fifteen minutes in introduction before chucking them into a car together and asking the audience to take for granted that they were once best friends. Their performances are bereft of this assumed comraderie, and they spend most of the body of the film with one or fewer of their three supposed amigos.Here's the thing. Character is the foundation of even adequate cinema, and not only does ""Hot Tub"" forgo the character angle—which would be fine if the comedy compensated—but the inane dialogue they let dribble from their mouths blends tired, lazy college humor with lame eighties retrospective. To give you an idea of the intellectual level that the film and its pull-string characters operate on, at one point Nick (Craig Robinson), suspicious that he has been transported back in time, asks a stranger, ""What color is Michael Jackson?""I'll let that one simmer. Not only is the gag unfunny, but it's so stupid a thing to say that hearing it is outright frustrating. The joke is for the benefit of the 21st century audience rather than the internal logic of the film, and ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is pathetic in its universal preference for cheap laughs over creative integrity. Even ideas that should be amusing either aren't or lack polish and execution. There is a somewhat successful running gag involving a future one-armed bellhop (Crispin Glover) presented with an escalating series of arm-threatening situations in the past—though with a completely unfulfilling pay- off. That and a laundry list of other scenarios might have worked had ""Hot Tub"" had even a germ of originality.I don't mean to offend with my comedic snobbery, but plainly, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is the sort of film I can't abide. As one who's attempted to write comedy before, watching the director pander (successfully) to the lowest common denominator while liberally pilfering from better work is an enormously frustrating experience. The screenplay is asinine and a blatant cash-in on the inexplicable wave of popularity a certain film by Todd Phillips generated last year. And yet I must concede, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is even a step removed from that. It's a pale imitation of a white turd.",Hot Tub Time Machine

The events leading to their time travel are just ridiculous, for some reason they go to a resort they used to frequent and the hotel is now a dump with cats walking around it's lobby and a bell hop who throws around your luggage and yells at you which is all very realistic but they stay anyway. They find themselves back in time because of a very scientific hot tub glitch and then when they realize they are young looking again they don't use it to their advantage at all, they cry when sleeping with hot girls and try to repeat their past without knowing that they have to or not. There are some stupid drug references, one guy does a huge line of coke then just stops, another guy takes a dozen bong hits, mushrooms and drinks a ton but is then sober ten minutes later. John Cusack's character has the hot young love of his life in a bed but refuses to sleep with her. The other one is 24 years in the past but can only think of his current ex wife. They are watching a NFL playoff game they know the outcome of but they still lose? Clark Duke is unfunny and is running around with Chevy Chase in some pointless attempt at cohesion. The black guy is sporting a Kid and Play high top haircut but is playing a Rick Springfield song on stage which in the 80's would be two totally different styles.How they have any money is another issue, their 2010 credit cards would not work in the past and even the cash money would be different but yet they are always drinking at bars but they seem to never eat. They are desperately trying to find a energy drink that will help them get back but during all this one guy finds the time to get laid. Then the black guy calls his 9 year old future wife to curse her out, but how he knows her phone number from 24 years ago way before they even met is beyond me. Then the guy getting laid realizes he needs to continue so the kid won't disappear and the girl just agrees to finish and get pregnant in front of her brother.The ending is basically retarded, they all come back except Rob Corddry's character who stays behind and becomes rich by using his knowledge of the future and somehow has set up a perfect life for them which of course is impossible. They also have no knowledge of their own past which would make life pretty hard, and Cusack's wife looks just like she did in the past.This is a really dumb movie.",Hot Tub Time Machine

Upon arrival, they are heartbroken to learn it is now a dump, so they decide to make the most of it by getting wasted in a hot tub and, through some negligent spilling of alcohol into the tub's circuitry system, they inexplicably end up in 1986 (come on, it happens to the best of us).The film employs a steady stream of both slapstick and wordplay jokes, interplayed with a heavy dose of crude, sexual humour straight out of the Apatow handbook. If that's not what you consider funny in a comedy, I regret to inform you that you will not find this film at all humorous. Few jokes are either original or elaborately constructed, but they do achieve their task of making the audience laugh aloud, which seems to be occurring less and less frequently in cinemas these days.Steve Pink does well, however, to harness the power of one of comedic cinema's strongest tools when used correctly: the running joke. Without giving too much away, it involves Crispin Glover's unfortunate hotel bellhop who seems to avoid imminent danger until the final scene, and his desperation to avoid said danger in a faulty elevator makes for the biggest laugh of the entire movie. Certainly, every main actor involved in this film is to be commended. Cusack enjoys making minor but obvious references to his past glory as a superstar of yesteryear. Clark Duke, for all his inexperience, does justice to his role as the token socially awkward teenager and Rob Corrdry steals every scene as the unpleasant, self-absorbed alcoholic. And with every supporting role he notches up, Craig Robinson pushes his claim as a comedic lead actor. His timing and delivery in this film in particular make for some very funny moments that don't involve someone getting injured in some way.The film quickly becomes a reference-fest as soon as the Second Act commences. Lovers of 80s icons will appreciate the good-natured digs at films such as The Shining, Red Dawn, Back To The Future and a plethora of John Hughes classics. Where somebody like Tarantino will make the effort to conceal the majority of his allusions to add intertextual depth to his film, HTTM ensured every audience member makes the intended connection to the aforementioned films.Of course, I always say that there is only one aspect of life more subjective than film, and that is comedy within a film. Everything I've mentioned as a positive about HTTM may be disregarded by those who have different tastes in humour. 'Not that there's anything wrong with that.'*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",Hot Tub Time Machine
108,caseynicholson,"A Fun Comedy Overall, But Lacking",6,26 March 2015,"I finally watched this 2010 movie after having seen previews for the sequel that is currently in theaters. I found it to be about what you might expect: nothing that was genius, but nevertheless a fun break from reality for a couple of hours. It wouldn't be much of a spoiler to note that the movie revolves around a time travel trip that occurs via a hot tub. A more comprehensive summary would be that a group of friends find themselves on a vacation at a favorite resort when they happen to discover that the room's hot tub sends them back in time to the 1980's. The gist of the film is their attempt to get back to the present without altering the past.That said, the movie was fun, but it was a bit sophomoric. Sophomoric isn't always a bad thing, mind you--some films can pull it off quite well. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" doesn't do bad with its humor, but there is a sense in which its attempt at humor is sometimes more contrived than its overall storyline (which doesn't bode well for a movie of such a title). While this is true overall, Craig Robinson manages to offer up a great performance, which is to be expected from one of comedy's best (and most underrated) silver screen actors.I'd give it a positive review overall, thus my 6/10 stars.",Hot Tub Time Machine
109,Simon_Says_Movies,The best time traveling hot tub movie of all time!,8,29 March 2010,"Prepare yourself, dear reader, for I am about to make a bold declaration that will either inflate or obliterate my prestigious position as a famed film critic. Here goes. John Cusack's throwback 80's flick is the best time traveling hot tub film ever created. Did I just blow your mind? Coyness aside, Hot Tub Time Machine is a supremely entertaining comedy, brimming with laughs and raunch all cemented with ample 80's nostalgia.Director Steve Pink is no stranger to creating successful comedies, nor is he a Cusack virgin, having written the screenplays for both classics Grosse Point Blank and High Fidelity. He also helmed the criminally underrated 2006 comedy Accepted and with a resume like that, the fact that HTTM transcends in high concept title should really come as no surprise. There are some unnecessary visual gags and gross-out humour but the strength is in the writing and how the four leads skilfully execute that script. This is the perfect drunken Friday night movie and the kind that will only grow in cult-status as time progresses.The four aforementioned leads are as follows: John Cusack as a single, unhappy man, Craig Robinson as a married, unhappy man, Rob Corddry as a divorced, unhappy man and rising young rising star Clark Duke as a nerdy, unhappy young man. For the exception of Duke's character that has never really lived, so to speak, the trio of former childhood friends have not seen their lives progress as they once dreamed. After Corddry's Lou attempts suicide, they all travel to their former haven in the mountains where they encounterwhat elsea time travelling hot tub. Whipped back to that very spot in the winter of 1986, they must choose between changing what had gone wrong in their respective pasts, versus facing the ramifications of altering their futures.There are ample accolades that can be given to the cast of Hot Tub Time Machine and each character brings something different to the proceedings; Cusack is the wry straight-man and recaptures much of the essence he possessed in the 80's movies that made him famous. Robinson, who has been hilarious in essentially everything he has done, gets considerable laughs and a memorable singing number. Duke, as I alluded to is gaining momentum, still to star in the highly buzzed, ultra- violent Kick-Ass later this year. Finishing off with the main players, Rob Corddry gives his best performance, dropping much of his annoying mannerisms put forth in earlier films and succeeds in creating a far more endearing presence even though much of the raunch flows through him (or out of him in some cases). The best running gag is tied to Crispin Glover as an armless bellhop and is executed in a way you need to see to fully appreciate.For some reason, this film is drawing comparisons to The Hangover ad nauseum. Not only are the similarities limited to their rating and the target demographic but Hot Tub Time Machine is far better in most every way. One thing I will say, along with last years smash, if this film is merely a rung in a growing ladder of quality R-rated flicks, then there will be no need for time travel; we need only look to the future.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",Hot Tub Time Machine
110,Qanqor,Vastly better than I expected,7,28 March 2010,"Maybe I liked this movie because I had such subterranean expectations for it. From the previews, and, indeed, just the title, I was certain it was going to be stupid rather than funny.But I went out to dinner with my friends Saturday night, and after dinner, to my chagrin, everybody had a reason to bail on the evening, and I found myself alone, at 9pm, with nothing to do, and not wanting to go home. So I went to the theater to play movie roulette. Hot Tub Time Machine was playing almost immediately, and the next movie after that wouldn't be for another 45 minutes. I *almost* turned around and went home, so sure was I that this film was going to be stupid rather than funny. But I figured, what the heck, I'm here...Well, the movie *is* stupid. But it's funny too. And what's more, it knows it's stupid and makes no bones about it. At no time does it ever take itself seriously. Now, I could have done without some of the extremely gross bits. Happily there aren't *too* many of them. And I'm sure I didn't get all the 80's references; although I did live through the period, I largely avoided popular culture at that time, and still couldn't tell you most of the bands or big hit songs of the time (or of today, for that matter).But I have to confess, the movie did make me laugh. Not all throughout, but I did have a number of genuine, laugh-out-loud moments. And plenty of chuckles and smiles. And I found myself genuinely liking the characters, and finding them to have a bit more depth than I expected from a film entitled ""Hot Tub Time Machine"". And the basic theme of the loss of the zany, free-form fun of youth, and regret of the relative staid blandness of ""adult"" life, is a theme which resonated with me.Now, let's get real. This is no ""Citizen Cane"", ""Vertigo"", or ""The Godfather"". Nor is a timeless comedy masterpiece like ""Airplane"", ""Blazing Saddles"", or ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Someone here displayed gross unfairness in trying to compare it to a classic '30's comedy, but obviously this is not ""It Happened One Night"", ""Bringing Up Baby"", or ""Duck Soup"", and if you go to the theater expecting it to be, the fault lies with you. What it is is a silly, fun, enjoyable way to pass a couple hours. Not deep, not profound, not brilliant. Not timeless, not enduring.But not bad. And not nearly as stupid as it looked like it was going to be. And these days, that's not too bad.",Hot Tub Time Machine
111,hoxjennifer,Surprisingly hilarious,8,16 May 2015,"Think of The Hangover in a time machine. This pretty much sums up this movie in a nutshell. If you're into the ridiculous, drunken, friendship/bonding humour of the Hangover, you will definitely enjoy this one. Hot Tub Time Machine surprised me in its genuine hilarity. I'll admit, the title doesn't sound too appealing and I honestly thought it would be some low budget lackluster try-hard movie that would have me cringing the whole way through with try-hard humour. But this isn't it at all. As another user commented, nowadays it's hard to pull off poop, sex and vomit humour all in one shot, but Hot Tub Time Machine pulls it off well.Must-see comedy for people who enjoy dumb humour and impossible, but hilarious plots.",Hot Tub Time Machine

What kept me watching was that even though they supposedly went back to 1986 they still looked the same. I figured what was happening, but I wanted to see what they were going to do. I'm glad I did because once they figured they went back in time the show was still silly, but it became interesting because now you see what they do with the knowledge.Before the time change I didn't find anything funny, but after the time change I found myself laughing several times. You can't expect a lot from a show like this but silly fun. That much it does deliver. So just watch it for the fun of it",Hot Tub Time Machine

114,dudedazzreviews,Quite funny but feels too much like The Hangover,6,7 October 2010,"I saw the trailer for Hot Tub Time Machine and instantly I knew that it would be a funny comedy and I was right. The story has been done before and doesn't feel very original, the only original thing I can see in the movie is that the hot tub is a time machine. However, just because it isn't original, doesn't mean it wasn't funny. It was a lot of fun to watch and some parts were quite funny but there were a couple of scenes when you felt like you should be laughing but you don't. Sometimes, it tries using the lowest form of comedy such as vomiting on a squirrel and there are one or two silly comedy scenes but this won't put you off the film. The characters aren't really very original and they felt like you've seen them before in films such as The Hangover but I have to admit that the four of them together make a believable group of friends. The acting was very good and the cast gave out a funny performance but you felt that some of the scenes they were in just randomly happened for no reason. The direction was good and the script was well written which made for some funny dialogue.I really did enjoy watching this but I thought it would have been funnier than it was. It has the humour of The Hangover but it's not very memorable as it. There were some funny lines and the story was quite good but it's nothing you haven't seen before in other movies. All in all, it's not original and it has been done before but it is a funny movie and it's probably worth a look.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Hot Tub Time Machine
115,austin-takahashi,Hot Tub Time Machine (Quick Review) - 2.5 Stars,5,4 February 2012,"Literally. There is a hot tub that is also a time machine. As a product, it is genius. As a premise for a comedy, it has great potential. Here, four losers are accidentally sent to the 80's and are in need for an escape, but not before they mess around with their past that could alter their future. The characters are lovable; I just wished they were doing more lovable things. Many jokes and gags are in reference to the time difference, and most of them are very funny.(Prevent Miley Cyrus? A-ha!) But unfortunately, even more jokes and gags are without any regard to its premise, and most of them are vulgar and unfunny. I do not hate this movie. It has laughs. I'm just sad it didn't exploit all the comedy it could get from such a rare and legendary item: a hot tub that is also a time machine.Official official here: http://localmoviereview.com/hot-tub-time- machine-movie- review/",Hot Tub Time Machine

117,tpaladino,Much more than just a dumb comedy!,8,7 April 2011,"I knew I was going to like this move almost regardless of how good (or bad) it was, because I just love dumb comedies, and unless they're completely inept it's not hard to get a laugh out of me. I also love the 80's, and anything with an 80's theme generally can hold my attention (again, unless it's completely inept - The Informers comes to mind). So from the time I saw the trailer for Hot Tub Time Machine, I knew that this was going to be a movie I'd want to see. Dumb Comedy + 1980's = Gold in my book. But what I wasn't expecting was a real, actual good movie to be in there as well. Yeah it's got all the dumb laughs and cheap humor that you'd expect it to deliver, but it also ends up having a great little plot and a feel-good ending about friendship and destiny that is unexpected but quite welcome. Even the 'bad' guys turn out pretty good in the end. It was also great to see John Cusack in a movie like this, considering what an 80's icon he was himself. The set designers and stylists got the 80's aesthetic right for the most part, which is not an easy thing to do (I have yet to see an 80's period piece that truly renders the 80's realistically), and the soundtrack is of course filled with great music from the time. Hot Tub Time Machine is of course not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but to me it succeeds at being a lot of fun and much more satisfying than I expected.",Hot Tub Time Machine
118,d_art,'Hot Tub Time Machine' has much to offer for the nostalgic,8,30 March 2010,"Adam (John Cusack), Lou (Rob Corddry), and Nick (Craig Robinson) are lifelong friends who are unhappy with their lives. Along with Adam's nephew, Jacob (Clark Duke), they revisit a favorite ski resort they loved from their late teen years. When they get there, they discover a hot tub that turns out to be a time portal to 1986—they are now trapped in that said time as their younger version, reliving their past and missed opportunities, with a possibility (or impossibility?) of changing their present/future. They must get some vital element (not Plutonium, though) that's important for the time machine before dawn so they can go back home.This film is all about the 80's--the hair, the music, and the slang. The look of that time period is revisited in fine detail. Loosely based on Back to the Future's time traveling plot line, this film also has Crisper Grover (George McFly from BTTF) making an appearance as a one-armed bellhop. Jacob, who occasionally fades in and out, also has a fear of being erased from existence by accident. It also pokes fun at Quantum Leap, as the main characters' mirror reflection is their younger self. Chevy Chase, the repairman, may or may not be a hologram. With much nod to old-school references, the younger generation may have a hard time appreciating (much less getting) the humor and subtleties of the generation.I enjoyed The Wedding Singer, a film that wouldn't have worked at all if it took place in the 90's. This film is a bit like that, mixed with some male-bonding stuff and guys who look back to relive their past. Much like many buddy comedy films as of late, this one fits right in there. There are poignant moments. The characters are likable and the time travel concept is fun. John Cusack plays his usual, everyman role, but that's why we like him. Lou (Rob Corddry) provides much of the wild and uncomfortable humor.Much of the humor is dependent on how much we like the characters. Luckily, each of their dilemmas is interesting. Adam wants a second chance with the one girl he once dumped. Lou wants to get back at his bully. Nick wants to relive his dream as a band vocalist (e.g. Back to the Future) before he gets back. Jacob has to make sure the other guys don't mess with the timeline that will erase him. Their paths cross and their friendships are tested. This presents them the dilemma of whether they should even attempt to ""fix"" anything (Back to the Future) or let it play out as history says it should (Quantum Leap)—there isn't any hard sci-fi, by the way.The plot works fine within the film's framework. It's basically a sci-fi B-movie-style broad comedy. This film is directed by Steve Pink who wrote the screenplay for Grosse Pointe Blank and High Fidelity (a great flick costarring Jack Black in perhaps his best role), both of which starred John Cusack. I wished he had written this film because this film could've used some of his sharper wit. While the film is mostly funny overall, occasional jokes do fall flat and some parts could've used one more draft of rewrite. Much of the humor also (although not surprisingly) tend to be toilet and sexual humor, with some gratuitous drug use and nudity.The film is not sophisticated, but isn't trying to be. It's called Hot Tub Time Machine, after all. There's no real sci-fi. They know it's silly and seem to revel in it. There are some fun geeky references, familiar faces, and nostalgic elements for those who grew up in that era. I suppose that makes it a period film. sort of. 80's music always sounds much better in film soundtracks anyway. *** out of **** stars.You can follow my article updates on Twitter at http://twitter.com/d_art",Hot Tub Time Machine

John Cusack was good as the straight man and Rob Cordry was his usual over the top manic type, but very funny. Cordry played a suicidal, oversexed, hard drinking friend.Anyhow, the plot is as it sounds. The actors are transported, while in a hot tub in some type of ski resort, back to 1986. I wasn't aware folks dressed so loudly back then. Anyhow, there is plenty of sex, drugs, rock & roll, and high jinks. It's a plot done many times before, most successfully with ""Back to the Future"", which ironically was filmed in 1985, 1 year before the year these present day time travelers were taken to.Time marches on, as they say. A good movie, very raunchy at times, with many cheap laughs. An entertaining diversion, nothing more.",Hot Tub Time Machine

The problem is that the F bomb is way overused. This may seem like a silly complaint considering the type of movie that this is; but a little bit of restraint would actually be more funny. Overuse of that word weighs down what should have been snappy dialogue. Another ding I'd give the movie is that they put Reagan and Aids in the same sentence of awful things the 80's gave us. I guess the fact that Reagan ended the cold war, gave the US an edge in defense, and had the greatest effects on the economy of any president before him are insignificant. But to be fair, this is the only glaring (and unnecessary) political statement in the movie. Except for the fact that the F word was used so much that it lost it's potential comedic value, this is a laugh out loud movie.",Hot Tub Time Machine
121,nathanschubach,A polarizing comedy that has some hilarious moments,10,16 January 2011,"I believe I shared the same nervous butterflies when I decided to rent this movie as a lot of other viewers might have. It's not that I didn't know who these actors were or what movies they did in their past; it's just a god-awful name for a movie. However, in this age of everything being a ironic joke (where even the characters are onto how bad the premise might be), I understood it. It's taking the idea of cheesy, grindhouse-related B-movies and adding it's own flair.I've learned that comedies are only as good as directors and writers will allow the comedians in the film to let loose and be their character, and this is what I learned from this movie. Yes, the opening dog feces joke was in poor taste, and it hardly added to anything else in the film. The rest of the vomit jokes caught me so off-guard, though, that they were funny. It's comedy at its base-level. When you're 13, there are so many experiences that you've never had: with women, drugs, drinking, relationships; that's the basis of why these elements are included. You laugh at bodily functions when you're young. As you get older, if you don't become a stuffy whiner, you'll appreciate the timing it takes to pull off a good ""projectile vomiting on a squirrel"" joke.There are too many moments in the movie that touched that inner kid going to see Dumb & Dumber or even later, American Pie, at the local cineplex. Was this movie an old premise with nothing original added to it for appeal? No. Was it terribly vulgar? Depends how uptight you are. If you don't understand why calling your future wife (who is about 9 in the movie) to curse her out for cheating behind your back in the future isn't funny, this movie isn't for you. You don't get it. For those who do, you'll love the jokes in this movie.It's a modern tale of what you would do if you were sent back in time to rectify what you want changed, and I love how this version of the story doesn't include some moral tale of having everything the exact way it is right now. This isn't Doc Brown telling you not to take the Almanac back in time with you because he didn't design the time machine for those purposes; this is about going for your dream, reconsidering what means the most to you, and following it. And a bunch of funny things in between.",Hot Tub Time Machine

123,TamPalm,"Silly, Simple, Sweet",6,4 April 2010,"This is a cute movie. Gross yes. Slow at some points yes. Predictable at other points yes. But it still works. It's not an Oscar worthy film. but it's also not one that will make you leave the theater upset that you wasted your time (which has been my experience way too much lately.) It drags at some points and tries too hard to be gross at others, but for whatever reason it doesn't offend your senses too much (say like a ""Bruno."") I think this is because after a slew of other gross, borderline slapstick movies, the modern moviegoer has become somewhat desensitized and can handle a little more shock.Anyway, the acting is solid, the plot is kind-of sketchy but not too much that it's hard to follow or invest in. While watching it, you definitely have the feeling after a while that you've been transformed to the eighties era and as such, you might wish for the movie's pace to speed up a bit. When it does, you're grateful and you forgive some of the more contrived elements of the plot.But what saves this film ultimately is the pleasant ending. So often these days movie-makers try to show their cleverness via creating a surprise ending with oftentimes a disappointing twist. This film has a twist, but it's welcomed and it makes you smile and feel better about investing your time into watching the whole movie, slow, gross, contrived parts and all.This is a feel-good movie that will make you chuckle here and there and leave the theater with a corny smile on your face.

Promoted as ""more laughs than 'The Hangover'!"" which didn't mean that much to me as I'm not a fan of ""The Hangover"" so it wasn't like the bar was set that high. Overall I'd say the movie was okay, an average comedy, I liked the time travel twist (say that five times I dare you) and the performances of Craig Robinson and Clarke Duke from ""The Office"". Chevy Chase had a worthless cameo. What I really didn't care for is the continuation of the trend in these types of movies to have an over-the-top sexually-charged character spouting innuendos and dick jokes every time they're on screen. I don't know if it started with Stiffler in American Pie, but that's the earliest that comes to mind and that type of role keeps popping up and I find it completely unfunny in its ridiculousness.

While it had some clever writing and decent laughs, it clearly came off as an 80s movie trying to be made in the year 2010 with a slant towards the fast paced humor and cut-down zingers of recent movies like Superbad, Knocked Up, or Get Him To The Greek. I did enjoy it and laughed a lot but it just felt a bit too forced to me. The back stories could have been fleshed out for each character a bit more and some of the happenings at the ski lodge should have been on screen longer. All i all, it just fell a bit hurried. Don't let title fool you, it's not that bad. If you must watch it, see the unrated version as it is funnier. Poor John Cusack, he'll never escape the ""80s Movie"" genre will he?

He's pretty cool.Unfortunately the movie has many problems in spite of the laughs. All the ""ladies"" spew profanity right alongside the boys, which just gets tiresome. It also tries to teach us about living life and pursuing your dreams... but ends up with the conclusion that money & success is the answer to your sadness.And obviously the time travel theme is just a setup for comedy, as the implausibilities keep adding up. There are conversations about the time-space continuum and how they need to avoid the butterfly effect... but it's all for nonsense as everything becomes drastically altered without any sense of believability.So if you can stand f-bombs throughout your movies, don't mind a crazy setup and want to laugh at the 80's - you'll have some fun. I did, but had hoped for a little more.",Hot Tub Time Machine
130,wolverinesforever,Embrace the anarchy,8,24 May 2010,"As weird as I feel writing this, I laughed while watching this movie. A lot. The film has an outrageous plot, plenty of crazy gags, and far more crude humor than what I'm usually comfortable with. But I went with it anyway.How so, you may ask? Well, that's something I've been wrestling with myself. But I've come up with at least two things that I think made this comedy a cut above (along with the numerous jokes, of course). First, I liked how character driven this was. The characters John Cusack, Clark Duke, Craig Robinson, and Rob Corddry play aren't at the mercy of bad punchlines or thinly developed. Not only are they allowed to drive the humor and the plot (or lack, thereof), they fully embody their characters like real people. You really get a sense for how their lives have gone downhill, how they wish for those ""good ol' days,"" and why they feel like they're at the mercy of bad fate. Notice also how they are not dumb. It may take them a little while to figure out they're in 1986, but once they do, they quickly come up with possible theories on what their actions will mean for the future and what they want to do for each other (and themselves) before the night is over.Second, I liked the film's message. With a plot as crazed out as this one, it probably makes sense that theme of this movie is to ""embrace the anarchy"" of life. And it's not a half-assed message either. I won't give away how the theme plays out, but I will say that I was very satisfied with the payoff.As many reviewers have pointed out before me, this film is filled with crude humor and foul language. You've already probably determined whether this is for you or not. But if you're willing to ""embrace the anarchy"" of this film, dip in. It's funny, the cast is great, and the theme is well executed.",Hot Tub Time Machine
131,DrLex,Recycled Materials,6,5 July 2010,"I watched this movie with basically no expectations at all. I hadn't seen any trailer or ad for it. The few expectations I had were low, based on a quick glance at the movie's description. It seems that having low expectations is key to making this movie enjoyable. Contrary to many other reviewers, I didn't totally hate it and was actually entertained for most of the 90 minutes. I knew what to expect: simple jokes, some gross things, some good and some lame 80's references, plot holes large enough to let the Death Star pass through, and of course: at least one view at nude male buttocks(*). And I got exactly that.If you expect anything of the following: 1. any even remotely logical explanation of why and how the time travel in this film happens; 2. an accurate depiction of the 80's; 3. good acting all over the board; 4. clever and mature humor; 5. originality; then you will have a much better time watching the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, even if you've seen it 10 times already.Hot Tub Time Machine can be best considered as a homage to classics like the aforementioned BttF and some more recent films, without much attempts at doing anything groundbreaking, and with a layer of humor of a similar level as in The Hangover laid on top. It's basically all recycled material, strung together with only a basic attempt at making it coherent. The references to other movies are obvious: one of the actors from BttF plays a role, and some other films are explicitly mentioned by the characters.Overall, there is a whole lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense in this movie. If you keep that in mind and just let yourself be entertained by the medley of mostly not-so-original jokes and the average attempt at creating an 80's atmosphere, you'll have a reasonably good time. Just don't expect a masterpiece. I give it a 6/10, for ""one notch above just good enough to watch all the way through"".(*): As for the nude male buttocks, I'm starting to suspect that all Hollywood directors had a meeting a few years ago and decided ""every movie made from now on must feature nude male buttocks at some point"". Seriously, I'm not going to the cinema to watch male bums. I can tolerate it in movies like these, but it's getting really old in other kinds of movies as a cheap attempt at bringing some comic relief.",Hot Tub Time Machine

""Back to the Future Hangover"". Hot Tub Time Machine is silly, obscene, and filled with profanity; the characters are barely likable (except for Nick, played by Craig Robinison), and it moves so fast that you don't get any chance to get a sense of who's who. And yet ... it's sometimes (and pretty often) fall-on-the-floor funny; the first clue is Chrispin Glover's surly one-armed bellhop, who THROWS the luggage on the floor from the cart and then sticks his one arm out for a tip. After being transported to the 80s (don't ask whether this makes sense) the quartet all find themselves reliving episodes they (or three of them) remember clearly and are afraid to change (for fear of changing time and space; they've seen every time travel movie made and and they know the lingo and the problems.) What it's really about is three guys who don't like the way their lives turned out, yet are afraid to change; it turns the familiar ""butterfly-effect"" trope on its head in that just maybe things might be better (not worse) if you changed the past in some way. Along the way there are a lot of little snarks about the 80s ... and a continuing saga of ""will the bellhop lose his arm or not?"". A couple of caveats: Lots (and lots and lots) of profanity and an ending that was a little too sweet. Other than that this is the funniest comedy I've seen this year.",Hot Tub Time Machine
133,anthony-burton4,"Awful start, but gets better",5,12 January 2020,"The main trouble with this movie is that the director subscribes to the belief that swearing is funny all by itself. That if you just go ""FK"", people will laugh.Well, maybe some do, if you're one of these, you'll probably LOVE this movie. If not then you may not make it through the first 20 mins. In fact, it's hard to like any of the characters on first impressions - they're either obnoxious, or losers, or both!But once it gets going, it improves quite a bit - there's some good interplay between the guys and a number of decent jokes - not really enough though - the concept is great and they could have achieved far more with it.

Last week we saw The Girl in the Dragon Tattoo and The Yellow Handkerchief. Both were very good but wouldn't appeal to a wide audience. My 45 year old daughter complains that we never go to her type of movie so we can tell her our recommendation. With that in mind, this morning I read the reviews of just opening films in the Washington Post. To my surprise, Ann Hornaday liked Hot Tub Time Machine. Since my wife and I like John Cusack we decided to check it out. I will always read Ms. Hornaday's reviews with skepticism in the future. The film is absolutely horrible for all but the last ten minutes. There are no laughs whatsoever. I don't mind the use of the f word but when it is used in almost every other sentence, it becomes tiresome. I remember the Ugly Truth which we liked but felt the overuse of the f word detracted from it. Like I said, we both liked Hangover very much so we're not prudes. I would recommend avoiding this movie at all costs. Even when it becomes the top grossing movie this weekend, don't be fooled.",Hot Tub Time Machine

The actual plot of this movie as depicted on the trailer is in no way realistic at all which adds to it's humor. Isn't that what we go to the movies for? A little escape of reality for a while? This movie from first moment to last is hilarious in every way and the jokes keep rolling. This movie is like all of the greater 80's movies piled into one with a mix of Back to the Future. Every character in this movie had a significant number of hilarious jokes, and the entire audience was laughing hysterically.

There is no character development whatsoever. The plot has holes you could drive a truck through. Just because you set out to make a silly movie doesn't give you free reign to ignore all cause and effect. The 1980s are presented in an unrealistic, two-dimensional and clichéd manner. I went skiing all the time in the mid-eighties and never encountered a lodge and people like in this film. Depictions of rampant drug abuse and casual sex only work in the context of advancing the plot of a well thought out movie.

138,puffball97,"Makes You Laugh, Makes You Think, Makes You Feel Young",9,27 March 2010,"""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is a vulgar, raunchy, foul-mouthed knockoff of ""Back to the Future."" ""Back to the Future"" was made in 1985 in which Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, a 1980s teen who was transported into a time warp he did not live through, but his parents did - the 1950s - and would see the future and no one else in that period would understand his 1980s sensibilities. One of the cast members of ""Hot Tub"" would be Crispin Glover, who played Marty's father, George McFly. Glover makes a cameo as a bellhop in the past and present sequences of ""Hot Tub"" as he did in ""Back to the Future.""""Hot Tub"" would feature three actors who grew up in the 1980s - John Cusack, an '80s staple himself, along with Craig Robinson and Rob Corddroy - and Clark Duke, whose IMDb bio lists him as being born in 1985, so he gets to play the nephew of Cusack who goes along for the ride and never fully understands the cultures of the 1980s.In the present day of 2010, Adam (Cusack), Nick (Robinson), and Lou (Corddroy) are in their 40s and not feeling so good about their personal lives. To escape, they, along with young Jacob (Duke) go to a ski resort where the three older men went back in 1986. When they get there, it is a ghost town. But they discover a jacuzzi where one inadvertently presses the digits and the four are automatically transported to the wild 1980s, a period of big hair, walkmen, spandex, Reaganomics, VHSs, the increasing popularity of heavy metal music, and the seeming lack of technology that would some day pave way to the Internet, Cell Phones, DVDs, Facebook, Twitter, Blackberries, and iPods. These guys know the words ""Dot-Com,"" ""Text,"" and ""Facebook."" No one else knows it yet. They also look the same as they do in the present era, but their mirror images appear younger, thinner, and more hair.There is a ""Back to the Future"" plot where Lou meets the girl of his dreams, the blonde Kelly, who is Adam's sister, and eventually marries her, producing Jacob as their son. Adam gets to marry April(actress Lizzy Caplan), who during that period thought he was a dork and shoves a fork into Adam's right eyeball. Nick first gets to sing ""Jessie's Girl,"" the popular 1981 Rick Springfield song, with his band, but goes 20 years ahead with ""Let's Get it Started,"" which stuns the audience. In the end, the four go back to the present and learn that problems are in every era and they have to be dealt with and not to be escaped. They find they are happier more so today than they were as young men.The movie throws in a short but delicious cameo by comeback kid Chevy Chase, whose movie career soared during the 1980s with ""Vacation"" and ""Fletch"" movies. He is the wise old hot tub repairman who keeps warning the four if they are not careful, they have to go back to the present, thus constantly zapping young Jacob for his carelessness.If you lived through the 1980s, as I did, you can easily identify the numerous pop culture references and even some anachronisms, if you can pick them up as well. But if you didn't live through the 1980s, you might be a little confused. I wasn't around during the 1950s, but when ""Back to the Future"" came out, the 1950s references were easier to identify for those who didn't live through that decade.""Hot Tub"" may have a lot of swearing in every other sentence, but it is all creative swearing, which too many movies don't have. Most movies force the cursing for cheap laughs, but they don't come out too funny, such as in last year's ""The Hangover,"" which I found overrated, bombastic, and unfunny. The 1970's Paul Newman hockey comedy ""Slap Shot"" is another example of creative swearing that is often funny and never offensive. More to the point, ""Hot Tub"" appears as shallow teen sex comedy, but it is more intellectual in the sense that it makes you think about how we deal with problems in every era, from the confused young adult to the physically pained middle-aged adult. Jump into this hot tub for good times and big laughs. I'm glad I did.",Hot Tub Time Machine
139,aefrench,"Suspend belief, or you won't like it",6,5 September 2010,"Before I begin my review, I will say up front that if you cannot suspend belief when it comes to watching a movie, Hot Tub Time Machine is not for you. If you can suspend belief, read on.Three adult friends, Adam, Nick, and Lou, have not had the lives they thought they would have at their age. After Lou almost dies at home, the trio decide to take a trip to a winter resort where they stayed in 1986 and have some overdue fun. Along with Adam's nephew Jacob, they arrive to find that the place is nothing like it once was. The four of them find a hot tub outside their room and decide to try it out. A drinking binge ensues and some of what they are consuming spills onto the controls of the hot tub.After waking up in the tub, they get out and notice that a lot of people have shown up in the area, and everything looks like it did in the 1980s.None of the quartet seems to get what's happening until they finally realize they have traveled back in time to 1986, the very same year, and day, that they were at the resort. Of course, they want to go home, but they also wonder what would happen if certain events are altered. Will history repeat itself?The acting is good here. John Cusack plays the good guy character like he usually does. Rob Corddry is the standout of the bunch, however, as the obnoxious Lou. For anyone who has seen any of the American Pie movies, think of Lou as an older version of Stifler. Chevy Chase doesn't have a lot to do as the repairman of the hot tub who appears and disappears in no time.The script is very reliant on one-liners and plenty of profanity. So if you have an issue with the latter, this is not recommended for you. For all of you that grew up in the 80s, the film is loaded with references to that time, and I really liked that aspect of the film. You will get a sense of nostalgia by watching this. I sure did. This movie isn't bad at all, just far-fetched. It does make you laugh more than once, though, so it is worth a look. But I did not find it to be as funny as others thought.",Hot Tub Time Machine
140,kargaan,Poor Mean Spirited Comedy,4,17 February 2011,"I hate to burst everyone's bubble about hot tub time machine but I really was disgusted and offended with just about every scene of the movie. It's not just because of the crude humor but how the characters acted and how the movie had hardly any feel good moments. I didn't care for any of the lead characters at all. They all seemed like people you would want to stay away from much less hang out with them. Chevy Chase shows up in the movie just to say "" look at me i'm Chevy Chase"" pretty much. All of the jokes were hateful and mean spirited and then they just throw in a ""heart-warming"" scene to make you forget all of what you've seen then go right back into crude humor and pervasive swearing. There's even a joke that spans for most of the movie in which the outcome was completely predictable. Speaking of swearing, I have no problem with the use of the f word in movies. That is of course if it is used correctly and not abused. This movie abuses the f word tremendously. Every sentence is filled with 2 to 3 f words. It's just lazy and shameful. After I saw this I was not happy or laughing but just depressed and ashamed of the writer, director, and anybody involved with this movie. There was some funny parts but they're not worth mentioning.

141,Bigbang,A good premise wasted.,3,12 July 2010,"Positives:1) A few good laughs scattered about. Maybe four or five. Most of the time I groaned and rolled my eyes instead of laughed. 2) Solid premise. I enjoy the 80s, particularly the music. Home Sweet Home by Motley Crue is still a great song. 3) Boobs.Negatives:1) The characters yell and argue like maniacs the entire movie. It's grating and headache-inducing. 2) They're also buffoons and morons, but that's how guys are portrayed in comedies. I got bored of that a long time ago but it seems people still find the dumb-guy shtick funny. I'm tired of it. Apatow and his clan covered it nicely, now we're beating a dead horse.3) They wasted the premise. Instead of exploring the unique cultural aspects of the 80s and deriving comedy from that, it amounted to nothing more than a backdrop. The focus was these idiots arguing about god knows what and beating you over the head with running jokes of the guys trying not to alter the future by having significant things change in the past. Tedious and a wasted opportunity.4) Way too much F-word. I like cursing. I curse. But this movie had more cursing than an outlaw-biker gang meeting. I found it very distracting. 5) Wow. Shlt, urine, puke, semen, ...did I miss any? They got 'em all covered. So funny omg! Haven't seen that type of comedy before! Wait a minute, I don't think anybody farted in this movie. Maybe I missed it. I feel kind of ripped off here.6) Under explored female characters. The best part was the relationship between Cusack and some past girlfriend but I could barely follow what the hell they were talking about. Also, John Cusack needs to smile more. His entire career it's like he's in a perpetual state of anxiousness and cynicism. Even if he does crack a half-smile it looks to be forcefully dredged up from the bowels of his miserable soul.7) The bald guy character, I don't even know his name. All he does is yell and argue with everyone like a lunatic. Jesus, calm down already.That's about it. It's good to have a movie that goes for over-the-top comedy, to let yourself go and enjoy the absurd situations and characters, but this movie lacks any humanity to connect to. It's a bunch of obnoxious morons who don't exist of Earth yelling and fighting. Something like Knocked Up, for example, has a sharp perceptive wit and mixes in a humanity to keep it grounded ,so when they do strike at uncomfortable truths or situations, instead of cringing, you laugh.

It flows well with consistent laughs.Probably helps if you grew up in the 80s, as I did, and you can relate to the references, and the return of the awesome Crispin Glover as a past and present character, appearing to enjoy himself again with the role he plays in this film as sort of an homage to the classic George McFly, which I'm sure is how they meant it.

It means that a work of fiction meant to take place in a specific time period includes things that are not from that time period. This movie is FULL of anarchisms. It attempts to be a period piece of the 80s, but it was filmed in the 90s and 2000s. First flaw; the cameras work different. Second flaw; the actors are older. Third flaw; the way casting auditions work has probably changed due to social networking, changing the way the actors mesh and flow. This does NOT seem like an 80s movie. The fact that this film was written in the 90s shows; John Cusack's role is more like his character in ""Must Love Dogs"" and a lot LESS like his character in ""Risky Business"", or his stint on the children's television show ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"". This is NOT 80s Cusack.When in ""Risky Business"", Cusack has the brilliant comic foible of Jack Black to be the straight-man to, here he just has rejects from UK's ""the Office"", which should have stayed on BBC. The fact that these plants are making their way into an attempt at theatrical BO is proof that this film was not intended for large audiences, and therefore probably didn't have much care put into filming it. In fact, it's barely a film at all; this seems more like a comedy pilot for BBC television. As a television series or mini-series, this could have worked. Granted, I'm not the audience for television, but I've seen some of the muck on television and this would fit right in. I review films, FEATURE films. That means they get top billing on the marque, and are not short films and or advertisements playing BEFORE the feature, THEY ARE THE FEATURE PRESENTATION. The fact that this film is being advertised as a TOP-BILLING is a practical joke. It's like if I made a film that's supposed to be featured in the 70s, with Ben Stiller poking a fluorescent dildo out of his ass while Bob Odenkirk from TV's ""Everybody Loves Saul"" does a pantomime to Kool and the Gang, but all the while they're filming it on their iPhones and sending it on twitter to internet porn stars. This just does NOT make any sense in the context of the movie.The technical credits are a technical discredit; no one worked on this film. I'm guessing a couple of lesser men on a real film set took some time out of their breaks to turn the camera on the corner and let the supporting actors and extras film this comical strip on the sly, and it was hastily edited together and slipped under the radar of the latest Tom Cruise billing as a feature film. John Cusack was obviously hired with cocaine, as there could not possibly be room in the budget for a conventional salary, and this film at the foundation is probably just a front for cocaine money laundering, so there's plenty of that at a low overhead.

Its just a shame that the concept failed to live up to expectations and left me feeling like I needed my own hot tub time machine so that I could travel back in time and avoid ever watching the movie.When a disgruntled middle aged man attempts to commit suicide, it is down to his old friends (through association rather than choice) Adam and Nick, played respectively by John Cusack and Craig Robinson, to restore his faith in humanity with a trip to a ski resort from their teenage years. Joined by Adam's nephew Jacob, it is not long before the foursome take a ride in a time bending hot tub and wind up twenty years earlier when the ski slope was in its heyday - queue sexy young ladies in 80s gear and an endless stream of crude, unfunny jokes.This is basically Back to the Future crossed with The Hangover -as the marketing team behind the film have kindly pointed out - but what they fail to mention is that while it may sound brilliant on paper, the amalgamation of the two ideas falls flat as both plot lines meander aimlessly from one dull situation to the next. There are a number of moments throughout where Hot Tub Time Machine goes beyond being a homage to its influences and becomes a blatant rip off, failing miserably to replicate the choicest moments from Back to the Future and instead just ruining the credibility of the film.I sincerely hope that unlike most comedies the actors were not required to ad lib their own lines, as while this works well with comedians such as Steve Carrel and Will Ferrell, Cusack and co. could not cause a single smile with their laboured gags. If however, the actors stuck rigorously to their lines then the scriptwriters would benefit enormously from a visit to their local comedy club to gain some fresh ideas, as the jokes could have easily been written by an immature teenager.For me, the star of the whole film was Crispin Glover, whose mere inclusion is bound to incite comparisons to everyone's favourite time travel movie involving a flux capacitor. While his screen time is limited, the running gag revolving around the loss of his limb is very amusing, a clear cut above the rest of the humour, but serves only to frustrate the audience as they realise that Hot Tub Time Machine had the potential to be something very special.Hot Tub Time Machine is a missed opportunity, and while it is not the worst of comedies, the only reason it stands out from a crowded genre is its daft title and stolen ideas. By cleverly fooling the general public with a brilliant marketing campaign, Hot Tub Time Machine is bound to fair reasonably well at the box office but you would do well to spend your money on something far more enjoyable - go and buy Back To The Future, it's much cooler to travel through time in a Delorean.",Hot Tub Time Machine
151,ivimikey,Still very enjoyable,8,31 August 2021,"I think this movie possibly came out in the wrong year, I enjoy it more today than I did before.Lots of funny moments and scenes, funny surprises, and just an overall enjoyable friends movie.",Hot Tub Time Machine
152,thefinisher_23,"It's ""Lougle"" Now?",8,27 April 2010,"It is as it sounds. You can judge this by it's' cover (or poster suppose) and you will know all you need to about this film. Three buddies head to a ski lodge where they spent their youth partying, drinking, screwing and rocking their way into adulthood for something of a reunion. One of them brings his nephew with. The fact that he is a nephew really only is relevant because they then proceed to travel back in time where he doesn't in fact exist. Never mind much of the plot or its space-time continuum ramifications. This is all just a set-up for a wildly funny and thankfully vulgar comedy set in a decade where common sense and fashion sense were both in short supply.The three friends in question are Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson) and ""their ass*$%@"" Lou (Rob Corddry). The nephew is Jacob (Clark Duke) and he belongs to Adam. He also doesn't know who his father is. Whilst rocking out to Motley Crew and drinking red bull/vodka in his car, Lou passes out in his garage. His buddies view this as a suicide attempt even though Lou says otherwise. They decide to take Lou to their old ski-lodge stomping grounds for a reunion of sorts. Once they get to the now-rundown town they decide to make proper use of their rooms' hot tub. When they awake the next morning Lou greets a squirrel with a relentless blast ofwell see for yourself. Then they hit the slopes and as ""Kick Start My Heart"" blares and they begin to notice that amongst other things that ""Alf"" is still on the air. After the obligatory realization that they have in fact ventured back to 1986 the four are greeted by the hot tub's repairmen (Chevy Chase). He deals them some ominous advice then promptly disappears. Thus the dudes decide to do everything the same as before. That means Adam has to break-up with his ""Great White Buffalo"", Nick has a gig with his band, and Lou has to get his teeth kicked in. Jacob meanwhile is worried he'll be disappearing sometime soon.The plot of a film like this is meant to zany. It doesn't have to make sense, nor does it. From what other movies have taught me about time travel, this film sort of flips the bird to all forms of science. The 80's and all their pop-culture contributions are revered here. Films like this are rather refreshing. It doesn't try to be anything more than what it advertises. There's not much seriousness to the proceedings but the relationships and characters are still formed well. None of these guys have what they want in the present so why not change it up? Well, they don't want to erase Jacob but that's all sorted out in what is the films crudest and perhaps funniest scene. There's also something of a love-lost between the three guys. Their friendship doesn't mean as much as it used to and just because they're older doesn't mean that should be the case.The performances make this flick. Cusack channels his reluctant charm and wit with relative ease. Films like are this as easy for him as any. Robinson (""The Office"" and ""Pineapple Express"") is his usual reserved and confused self. His honesty makes him funny. Duke seems to be caught up in the proceedings. His character isn't from these times and for that he's rather terrified. Crispin Glover also gives quite a spark with his turn as one-armed and then two-armed bellhop. Chase is used sparingly as the all-knowing repairman. The funniest man in the film though is Corddry. You get the sense that he's not different then than he is now. He says and does whatever he wants. As opposed to his friends he wants to enjoy every minute of this. He has every scheme you could think including betting with Elway on ""The Drive"", combining twitter and Viagra, inventing Zac Efron and preventing Miley Cyrus. He does much more, but I can't print most of it.All in all ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is a hilariously easy film. It's crazy, nasty, and rude yet never once seems like it's trying too hard. That is the greatest sin any comedy can commit. It also doesn't forget that its characters may be occupying the realm of crazy but that doesn't mean they can't be real people. I make no apologies for liking this film. In fact I liked it a lot. Many who want to see a film like this will like a lot too. Credit its' truly funny and diverse cast. That includes the squirrel too.Visit me at Celluloidlove.wordpress.com",Hot Tub Time Machine
153,amarjunchu,Nice movie but do not try this at your Hot Tub!,7,17 December 2017,I am from India and I do not know much about 80s in my own country because I was born in 90s and without nostalgia I felt a little lost at times but I still enjoyed this movie. So the movie does not require extensive knowledge of 80s to be enjoyable but it will increase your enjoyment certainly if you are familiar with 80s. I may not know much about 80s but I did played Vice City. The story does not take itself too seriously and that just adds to the enjoyment and the twist at the end is just amazing. You will be predicting something else and the moment it hits it just works and its very funny!,Hot Tub Time Machine
154,milstar,Nice throwback to the 80s,8,23 October 2019,"Well, sort of. This isn't some ridiculous cheesy actioneer, neither a gory horror sequel. In fact, imagine the mix of The Hangover and Back to the Future, and you'll get this surprisingly funny little gem. Truth to be told, I was skeptical about the film initially. Especially after Philips' money-smashing, acclaimed trilogy. But I was wrong. This movie is very funny, occasionally silly and gross, but it's still make you worth your time, especially during rainy Autumn days like now. Three friends with miserable life gather up to celebrate, or to better say, lament over their mostly missed lives. That is, until they discover a hot tub in the lodge that sends back through time in anachronistic 1986... This is where real fun starts. The cast is amazing and each play their parts very well, and each in their way, but imo Rob Corddry steals the movie. Kinda unexpected to me, considering the stars like John Cusack or Craig Robinson. Anyway, this the right type of movie to watch with your male friends, especially if you feel bored or depressed and not only during depressing rainy days in Autumn like now. But the best part of the film is that it is tasteful time capsule for 80s film fans, rife with references to 80s hits like Ferris Bueller, Sixteen Candles, National Lampoon, Night Shift, Porky's (the last two are the closest in the spirit of this titular film), beside said Back to the Future films. True, the movie isn't without flaws. There were some moments that kept you curious in terms of ""whats going to happen"" so be prepared. There is a LOT of drug use, said really vomit inducing pieces of humor and the fact that there is a chance that millenials won't pick-up many of the 80s jokes and references.Grab your buddies, leave your spouse at home to cook dinner, and enjoy Hot Tub Machine. You won't regret.",Hot Tub Time Machine
155,cyclerrollie,A Must See!,10,10 April 2014,"This movie finds the best way to balance comedy in its fast-paced storyline. There's never a dull moment, and all the characters are believable because of the actors portraying them. There's also some facts for the 1980's, such as Clark Duke's character beginning to fade in and out because he wasn't born yet, and Craig Robinson's character performing a Black-Eyed Peas song for the first time!The ending is awesome too with Lou staying back in the 1980's and creating ""Lougle"", while sitting out on a yacht with a hot girl.Chevy Chase as the repairman is awesome as well. He adds some spice to the movie.See this movie with some friends. Trust me, you'll enjoy it!",Hot Tub Time Machine
156,Yesh4,It's okay but not memorable,6,27 May 2014,"I expected this to be really stupid but really funny and I just love John Cusack so I got it on DVD. It was kinda stupid and fairly funny but the few hilarious jokes were all in the trailer.Everything was just mediocre about it, to be honest. It's like you know when you watch a great film and you feel all excited about it and want to recommend it to your friends, well that didn't happen for me with this film. I just felt nothing much but I didn't feel like it was a complete waste of time or anything because it was fairly entertaining. What I didn't like was that there were so many f-bombs. And I don't even mind swearing but literally every second word was an f-word as if a teenager wrote it. Craig Robinson and John Cusack's acting was good (although not Cusack's best)but I found Rob Corddry crass and annoying.This time-travel stuff has been done in more memorable and better movies such as ""Back to the future"".

The publicity I heard about this flick was that it was - let me paraphrase - ""A great, humorous tribute to 80s comedies"". Erm, yeah, right! It MAY have one or two slight smile moments, but in general, it is one huge disappointment. And not just as a ""a tribute"" to the 80s, but as a whole, as an absolute, as a flick itself.This, my dear friends, is one hell of a stinker of a movie, and I, for one, feel utterly saddened and disappointed that an actor as great as John Cusack could stoop so low as to commit to this insipid and re-rehashed script.This doesn't get a zero or a one rating for the mere fact that he is in it and Chevy Chase makes a Luke-warm cameo.Throw your money, and more importantly, your precious time at this at your own peril.",Hot Tub Time Machine

159,dfeenz,No Movie Will Out-Funny This Movie in 2010,10,29 March 2010,"To those going into the film ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" knowing what to expect, it is basically impossible to over-hype this movie. It is exactly what you expect - ridiculous, hilarious, bawdy, obnoxious, balls to the wall fun from start to finish. It is crammed with so many great lines that you will forget most of them and have to re-watch it (this is a great quality in a comedy). The physical comedy is great too, and every one of the leads gives a stand-out performance. You can only imagine how much fun they must have had making this. Craig Robinson can deliver ANY line with a straight, even intensely serious face. This is truly a gift from comedy heaven. Rob Corddry is terrific as Lou, the guy in every group of friends who everyone knows is an ass, but they stand by him anyway because they know that deep down he's just pathetic and feels sorry for himself. Clark Duke is basically the same character he was in the movie ""Sex Drive"" but that's not a bad thing at all. He is super-sarcastic and cynical yet has an innocent quality that makes him immensely likable. Kudos to Mr. Cusack for giving a low-key yet sympathetic performance, letting this movie be more of a breakout vehicle for his costars than a starring vehicle for himself. There is so much greatness in this movie that to point out my favorite parts or characters or homages to 80s movies is basically a moot point. The dialog is what really carries this movie, but if you are not easily offended by gross-out humor of say, the South Park variety, the gross-out gags here are also top notch. I hope this will usher in a new era for the movie comedy; an era where not everything has to be wrapped up in some pretty sentimental bow, where a stupid movie can exist just to be stupid and make you laugh, where a ridiculous one-joke premise can be stretched to awesomely mythic proportions. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is the movie that every funny guy or group of funny guys wishes they wrote themselves. It will be played in the background at parties for the next 20 years, replacing classics like ""Animal House"" and ""Caddyshack"" for any and every comedy fan with a DVD player and a liquor cabinet or bong. I for one will be buying the DVD the day it comes out.",Hot Tub Time Machine
160,UtopianUK,"Quite good, but not funny enough.",6,13 October 2013,"With a crazy premise, you'd think this movie would be full of hilarious moments, but truly funny moments are rare in a movie that severely lacks laughs. The cast is made up of quality actors, but the stand-out funniest character is played by Crispin Glover, who has a very small but inspired part to play. Out of the four central actors, Rob Corddry gets to shine, as his character is ridiculous and has some funny moments. Craig Robinson does his job well, but his character is quite dull. John Cusack doesn't get a chance to shine, as his character is boring and forgettable. Clark Duke is only in it for the script's sake, and his character is extremely dull. A mention must go to Chevy Chase, who has a tiny part, but I enjoyed seeing him.Apart from the inspired central idea of a Hot Tub that is also a Time Machine, the script isn't very imaginative. I wish the writing had been more creative and wacky. Overall, it's a movie worth watching, but don't expect loads of laughs.",Hot Tub Time Machine
161,frenchmonkeys,"Odd, formulaic, and oh so cheesy. I loved it. :)",8,8 June 2010,"I was a teenager in the eighties, and so revisiting that time sounds like a lot of fun. There's not much more to the movie - a hot tub takes a group of friends (and a nephew... ?) back to a time that was better for all of them.The sets are cheap and crappy, the acting is mediocre at best, the storyline/plot is so thin it's transparent, and the weak, cheesy humour is mostly recycled from other films - just like all the great movies of the eighties. This is not a strong movie in any regard, but I loved it, and I suspect anyone who was also a teenager in the eighties will enjoy it too. The addition of the current teen nephew character to make it appeal to younger audiences as well is probably pointless - if you weren't there in the eighties, you probably won't 'get' this. If you were, it's well worth a look.I award this film a totally undeserved 8 out of 10, cringing as I do so. Maybe I'll go see it again tomorrow...",Hot Tub Time Machine
162,shanpanjwani,The years first and perhaps funniest blockbuster.,10,24 February 2010,"Phenomenal. Simply phenomenal. I just got back from a screening for this movie and I must say I had the time of my life! Never before have I laughed so hard that I had to eventually both pant and cry in between them. The story is simple: 3 old friends and a nephew meet up after one of them contemplates suicide. Wanting to renew the spark of their friendship, the 3 friends(Robinson, Corrdry, and Cusack and his nephew) decide to visit the place they had some of their best times. They get there, and it is a dump. They go to the hot tub, which seems dirty, but suddenly rejuvenates itself. They jump in, get wasted, and Corrdry's banned drink spills on the heater, thus resulting in the time travel. While chaos does ensue, so does hilarity. Gags are plentiful and cringe worthy, such as the opening scene, the soap scene in the bathroom, etc. Nudity is scarce(only 1 female scene). All the characters did well, especially the main cast. Cusack was okay, & Robinson had his scenes from the trailer, as well as the ""cheating"" scenes. But, there is now doubt as to who is the star of this one folks. From the Lougle.com to the bathroom soap scene, and Motley Lue, Rob Corrdry stole the show. This is by far his best and funniest role thus far in a promising career. My favorite scenes are when he makes the suicide joke and removes the urine tube, as well as the things I listed above. But, the overall funniest moments were when Rob and John's sister are having fun while John and Craig listen from outside, knowing the outcome, and when Craig speaks fake Russian. There are more, but that's all I will share. The movie is also somewhat sentimental, with friendship as the central motif. It also reflects some of the perks as well as negative aspects of the 1980s. I just left the theater, and want to write down my main thoughts of the movie, so I did skip some aspects of the film. All in all, a thorough raunchy laugh fest which you will definitely enjoy. 10/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
163,dicksosa,Hot tubs are so awesome they can send you back in time!,7,2 April 2010,"I can just imagine the person trying to pitch this movie. ""Ok so here me out now we are going to have these older guys travel back in time in a hot tub! And they will be back in the 80's and it will be hilarious. And we will put in references to other movies and just make it soooo funny"" Oh yes that sounds super duper awesome! or not. Seriously I don't know how this movie was pitched because anyone who looks at a script and sees the title HOT TUB TIME MACHINE, has to ask ""seriously?!?"" That said this movie is surprisingly a well rounded flick for something that looks and sounds like it would just be a pile of used socks outside of a Goodwill donation center. It's go some great throwback references to classic 80's ski movies and time travel movies. And heck we even have McFly (Crispen Glover) in the movie. Now of course he is a different character but that is just obvious casting to use a Back to the Future actor in a movie about Time travel and the 80s.The rest of the cast does an excellent job playing their characters. From straight humor to being an asshole to the emotional tornado that is John Cusack from so many other films.This film is definitely a stupid humor movie. Don't expect any Oscar awards for this, but do expect to laugh a good amount. The humor is definitely a bit more directed toward guys and likely it's not a very good date flick. But if you expect to see a movie about a hot tub and a time machine and cheesy 80s hair styles this will fit that very specific bill.",Hot Tub Time Machine

Crispin Glover, who played George McFly from that film, appears in this as well as a bitter one-armed bellhop, who has 2 arms when the guys go back in time.The trouble with this film is that there is way too much swearing which was not needed at all. And the plot is not that well-written. A much better story could have been made out of this and it could have been so much more. The happy ending is a bit far-fetched too, but again takes it cue from Back to the Future. Before watching this, the trailer indicated that it was a comedy, but most of the comedy was in the trailer, there was not much else. The writers really could have done so much better. And the repairman (Chevy Chase) is a bit wasted in this film, he seems to be important to the plot and could have been used more with more interaction with the main characters. Also not enough of the 80s in the film to make me believe they really had gone back in time. A small gag with a skier on a ""brick"" mobile phone and the bright-coloured clothes give a hint of the 80s, but so much more could have been done.

Then late one night while browsing Netflix and looking for a 'mindless' film I decided to give it a chance (usually meaning I'll watch the first 15 minutes and 'Gong' it if it isn't doing it for me). Well let's say I was completely so glad I gave it a shot. It had me laughing all the way through. Keep in mind I was in high school in the 80s so that fact probably led to a lot of the appeal of the humor. It wasn't long into the film that I recognized the humor as being extremely similar to ""Sex Drive"" and as soon as the film was over I logged into IMDb as I knew it must have been the same director. I was shocked to find out I was wrong but eventually found the link in the screenwriter Sean Anders who did both films. I love his style of humor and hope to find more similar films. Totally just ""let loose"" humor, laid back, and at the same time very witty. I think you should give this film a try.

There's a scene from that movie that shows what TV would be like for the dumb masses, and all that is playing on it is fart jokes, people being hit in the balls etc. Not too different from some of the comedy contained in this movie.On a positive note, I thought that Clark Duke was quite funny.

He was in the ""favorite actors"" category for the classic ""Better Off Dead"", however ""War Inc."" best demonstrates the ""John"" we see today.Big fan of Rob Corrdry and Craig Robinson.

175,karthiksudhakaran-1987,A Time machine Sci-Fic which does not surely exceed expectations,6,6 July 2012,"According to me the movie had a pit-fall as far as the expectation or the hype of the audience is concerned. Especially the fans of the Sci-Fiction comedy genre. Even though the movie had the lot of sequences which demanded good amount of visual effects it had not been exploited well. I am afraid that the Director considered only the make and costumes as a medium to express the audience about the time period in the 80's. Even though that was not sufficient enough to drag us into that mood of Rock music and hippie hair-styled guys! The Screenplay was awfully predictable and the comedy was at times crude and repetitive in nature . And moreover we had seen these in a lots and lots of teen buddy movies LOL! As far as the Cast is concerned it was apt for the plot they took up. And the performance was fine. The Background score and music was not very original and innovative but was crisp at times. The Location reminds the thought of being filmed in a set on various instances. The Relationship of the Nephew character with the Lead character was not very realistic but the friends character seemed to work fine.To sum it up the movie is a one that you can enjoy when you needed some humor content plot and some sort of adventure mixed with Sci-Fic element. Well suitable on a lazy afternoon or a rainy day on which you have decided to rest on a couch staring some rubbish reality shows. Check it out , you won't regret. I give 6 out of 10.",Hot Tub Time Machine

Last night, after watching the football match, I didn't feel like sleeping, so I put on the DVD of the movie, thought it would help me sleep sooner.But as the movie went on, it was more interesting. A time tunnel inside a Hot Tub was a new concept, and I am also in love with Kodiak Valley. So it was fun to watch the movie.The characters Lou and Jacob were really cute at their places. The end was really unexpected and funny. Lougle was hilarious.The movie made me laugh after a long time. Thanks to the producer and director.",Hot Tub Time Machine
177,judegraysmith,Hot Tub rubbish but fun,8,15 November 2012,"I love kitsch and this movie is just that. I like the idea of a hot tub time machine and can only applaud any writer who came up with such a rubbishy idea for a movie. Liked the back to the 80's bits as I too was one of those people dressed liked that. I loved Poison and Skid Row and make no apologies for being a teen in the 80's. Fun movie, just don't expect high art. Think Weekend at Bernie's and you won't be far wrong as far as comedy goes. Well chosen cast. They are playing a bunch life's losers and we can all equate with that. Like I have said in other reviews, I'm a sucker for movies so bad they are good but this one is just a little better than that.",Hot Tub Time Machine
178,nate-204,I wouldn't give it a six out of ten....,5,22 August 2010,"Although I did give it a five. Yes, this was a somewhat entertaining movie - but if you haven't seen it - it is extremely vulgar with your share of profanity, sex scenes, drugs, rock & roll, etc, etc. The plot is extremely predictable but yes it did have me laughing several times too. If the vulgar stuff doesn't throw you and you have nothing better to watch then this might be OK - but I'm not sure anyone could ever rate this one as ""great"". There are some nice (but odd) bit parts played by Chevy Chase and ""Marty"" (the guy from Back to the Future). There was a lot of lost opportunity on great 80's gags that was instead spent on extremely crude scenes that didn't add much to the movie.",Hot Tub Time Machine
179,school_account,A pile of POO !,1,4 April 2011,"I just cannot believe that the great John Cusack Produced and starred in this pile of Rubbish. (I would have said something else there but the web page would have auto censored my comment). It is a film totally without any style whatsoever. Did Mr Cusack actually read the script before he started on this project, or what. If He were British this film would totally destroy his chances for a knighthood. Not only is the script without meaning , but the whole idea is pathetic in the extreme. It basically is not a comedy. It is neither a farce nor a slapstick, nor has any clever plot situations that could develop into funny moments. This movie has nothing to distinguish it at all. The beginning of the movie says it all. The characters are introduced in a totally haphazard way , which makes you not care about them or understand who they are, in any way that makes any sense. As the movie unfolds you still don't really get to know who they are, which makes watching this movie a totally boring experience. How reviewers on this site can say the movie is good is beyond my comprehension. Compare this movie with the other John Cusack comedy movie ""Being John Malkovich"". There is no comparison. One is probably the greatest comedy of all time, populated with fantastic performances and clever situations. whereas HTTM is not only the worst comedy of all time but the worst picture of all time, with poor performances and dull very dull situations. Nice one John!",Hot Tub Time Machine
180,wogsurfer,"What if you could time travel, would you?",7,27 May 2017,"If you were transported in back in time to where the most significant moments of your life happened, and they lead to life not working out so well, would you take the opportunity to change things?This is the conundrum most time travel themed films pose, but never with a deliberate outcome like Hot Tub Time Machine.After nearly committing suicide in his garage Lou (Corddry) is taken back to the place of where some of the wildest moments took place in his youth, Kodiak Valley Ski resort by his former best friends Nick (Robinson); a dog groomer whose wife cheated on him, and Adam (Cusack); whose ex-girlfriend has made his life hell.Disappointed that the resort is not the same wild party place they knew from the 80's, they decide that a night spent drinking in the hot tub is their best option, somehow they are transported back to 1986 and must relive a fateful night, plus also make sure Adam's nephew Jacob (Duke), who has tagged along for the trip, is born. What follows are a series of events that lead to a showdown with a resort cop with delusions of grandeur and a climax that comes somewhat expected, but also left me a little surprised when I first saw it, it's also the source of a bit of a paradox for mine.Time travel movies for me present questions about actions and consequences, and also looking at the road taken in the film for the story, but also other roads that could have been taken, and the results it may have made. I also often think about traveling back in time, and seeing the younger selves of my parents, and seeing first hand the events in their lives that have lead to the reasons for how they deal with things in the present.Paradoxes in the story left me with some questions, but they don't really need exploring because of the hilarious nature of the film. I also don't think this film was meant to pose any deep and meaningfuls, but it could make you think about what some of the consequences of time travel may lead to, good or bad.",Hot Tub Time Machine

The film is very disappointing, there are some good comedy moments but not enough to save it.I didn't like the character with the shaved head. A few months ago I got DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN on DVD for 2 euro and expected not to like it but I thought it was funnier than Hot Tub, had a better sense of silliness and was more warm hearted.

182,hearsz,The most overrated movie of the year!!,4,30 April 2010,"For those of you who are saying that ""Hot-Tub Time Machine"" is the best comedy since ""The Hangover"", knock it off! You people are really delusional for thinking or even saying that... Rob Cordy has to be the most annoying actor in Hollywood at the moment and like Dustin Hoffman's character in Tootsie - Michael Dorsey - should be finding it impossible to get any work whatsoever!! I'm a huge fan of John Cusack (High Fidelity, Grosse Point Blank) but he just seemed so out of place here. ""Kick Ass"" as a comedy was by far better because for one it didn't rely on a big name like John Cusack & Chevh Chase as well as a ridiculous story line to draw people into seeing this.Like one of the other reviewers said, ""Jacob"" played by Clark Duke is a complete waste as he spends a majority of the film chasing Chevy Chase's character around in the film! And whats with all the vomiting in film's nowadays.. It's unrealistic and way over the top.. And finally, why is Clarke's Mum ""Kelly"", OK with Lou continuing to have sex with her, even despite stating that he was going to impregnate her?? I know teenagers can be stupid but I just don't buy this kind of immaturity, especially on screen.The Ratings may have 7.4/10 now, but I will not be surprised in the slightest when this drops below 6.5 in a years time..Hollywood, stop wasting our time and hard-earned cash with this rubbish...",Hot Tub Time Machine

Yes, it was very funny and was entertaining at points and different times BUT it didn't exactly end up the way that I was expecting. The drug references were absolutely hilarious, along with the women that were in these 'grown- up' mens lives, many years ago. The number one part of the movie that I was awaiting from the time I saw the commercials to the time that I bought my ticket was the scenes involving exactly what the hot tub did and does for them, thinking it would mainly be revolved around how the hot tub became that way, finding that 3 scenes contained the hot tub, bringing my interest farther and farther down.

185,ptdlugosz,"Has an aftertaste of a teen comedy, that was forced into adulthood, and got seasoned with old-school charm.",7,4 June 2010,"The year is 2010, and four loser friends decide to reclaim their youth (or at least its illusion) through a night of drinking and partying... in a hot tub. But they get more than they bargained for – they accidentally go back in time to 1986. In a country where the threat of leg warmers, cassette players and rolled up sleeves is as real as it'll ever get...HOT TUB TIME MACHINE, directed by Steve Pink and written by Josh Heald, will be perceive by many, as this year's The Hangover. And there are many good reasons for that flattering comparison.The film engages the viewer really fast, and never falls pray to stagnation – the story is always on the move, but never in sprint. Pink's years of working in the film business, be it as a writer, producer, or director, turned out to be invaluable experience before taking on this zany story.We have four friends, who are fed-up with how their lives turned out, but when given a chance to fix them, they don't embrace it at first – they fear it. The years of regret have done their job. And a warning about screwing up the future by messing with the past from the Hot Tub Mechanic (played by Chevy Chase) doesn't help either.That whole panorama of issues, dreams-confronting-reality, wants and desires, are really strong tools in connecting with the viewer – it's like reaching out to the darkest corners of his or her souls and tickling them. Although it does sometimes border close on sexual harassment... That especially applies to Lou, played by Rob Corddry. Jerk, dick, asshole – he accepts all those titles with great honor and dignity, and will make the best of his stay in 86 (ever heard of Luogle?).The leads, are a bit of an odd pick...But then again, I do forget this film does not take itself seriously. So, we have John Cusack, Rob Corddy, Craig Robinson, Clark Duke (who?) and Chevy Chase. Although Chevy Chave, isn't really here to display his comedic skills. He serves more as the film's patron, re-assuring the viewers with his presence, that it's a legit comedy, that carries his stamp of approval.Oh! Question! What do you do with a film full of one-liners, carefully tailored for individual needs? Answer - Believable delivery, that's what.John Cusack, playing Adam - the voice of reason in the film (at least in the beginning) falls behind the rest performance wise. He's funny – yes, but there's not much zest to it. Also, his acting career, began in the 80's, where he ruled the hearts of teenage girls, and gained approval of their parents. This could have been a golden opportunity, to simply poke fun at it, call it homage if you want – all is fair in a film entitled Hot Tub Time Machine"". In this case, his place could have been easily taken by some other established actor, let's say, Matthew Broderick, and no one would tell the difference.And then we also have Craig Robinson, who might not be in The Office setting, but sure is in Office mode.And who could forget Clark Duke? Wait. Who is he? ... Anyway, moving on.To wrap up, the film is an all-you-can-eat-buffet of 80's but it's served to us on such a level, that it makes it safe for people unfamiliar with that time period, yet nostalgic enough for those who lived through it, and lived to tell the tale.""Hot Tub Time Machine"" has an aftertaste of a teen comedy, that was forced into adulthood, and got seasoned with old-school charm.

This one was so bad I couldn't justify the lost time sitting there like a moron watching the very not funny morons on the screen. I went because John Cusack was in it and figured he can only sink so low. I was wrong. He can't just need the money. I guess he needed something to do, but still. The characters were all just plain stupid, one being totally obnoxious but not in a funny way. Just obnoxious. An insult to anyone with half a brain. The plot, of course, is preposterous, but I knew that before I went in. It is possible to be creative even with a ridiculous plot. There was absolutely NO creativity present in this film (the first half at least, I just couldn't tolerate any more grossness and stupidity that just wasn't funny).

187,jameshull86,Worth the rental all day long,8,8 January 2011,"Thought it was great. Just didn't get the buzz like Hangover. Heard Cusack didn't want to promote it because even though he was more or less the lead, he was upset because he didn't end up really being the lead of the film as far as laughs, and it was a comedy. Let's face it, he's the only actor who is really famous and everyone knows his name. Truthfully, I just watched the movie and I can't remember the other actors' names, so he is the 'star' of the movie but when he read the script didn't he realize that he wasn't going to be the comic relief whatsoever? He does his job well, he always does, the same job, but that's why he gets the big bucks. He does what he does well and he's been doing that for a long time. When you see him show up in a movie, always as the lead, you know exactly how he is going to act and you're not disappointed. Problem is that he must have watched the movie and thought he was overshadowed on that one guy who had all the moments. Don't know his name, but he was the wild card and the guy ran with it. Even had the big moment at the end to do the right thing and he did, becoming the hero of the movie. So I guess Johnny-boy felt out-shined. He was and he wasn't. The other guy had more material to work with and he did. Cusack did his job. Just wish he went out there and promoted it, it was a fun movie as it was meant to be. Knew that as soon as that one character looked right up in the camera and said, 'we must have gotten into some kind of hot tub time machine' the movie accomplished its task!!!",Hot Tub Time Machine

It's a movie you put on for a good chuckle and some good performances from everyone. I was particular blown away from John Cusacks performance. I grew tired of him playing a writer in a overcoat. But he seems to offer more in this role. I call it a cult classic cause it came out over a decade ago and I still pop in time to time to enjoy it. The fact it got referenced in Avengers Endgame should at least give it a cult status. This isnt a oscar winning film. Just good raunchy entertainment with some time travel thrown in. So just enjoy it for what it is. I gave it a 10 cause I couldn't bring myself to bash this movie. Honestly one of my favorites,Hot Tub Time Machine

Luckily, I stayed in the room to watch it too since I have been a big John Cusack fan of a long time. After about the first 15 minutes, I shut the movie off. I swear, every other line of dialog contained the f-word, and on top of that, it wasn't even funny. It was absolutely one of the unfunniest things I have ever seen. It's like they didn't really have any funny material, so they have to insert copious amounts of swearing to compensate. Skip this loser of a movie! One star is too generous! Whatever possessed Cusack to participate in this bomb is a mystery to me. Rob Courdray's character is one of the crudest, most foul characters I have ever seen on the screen. It is beyond redemption.

I hoped for some recognition but that never happened. The movie maybe a little funny for young people to watch but I sincerely thought that the makers of the movie intended to make a movie for people of my age.

191,floppypig_16,Average low-brow comedy,5,10 August 2010,"If ""The Hangover"" and ""Back to the Future"" had sex, this would probably be the result. Unfortunately, he'd be the weird kid in the family who shares a fleeting resemblance to his parents but is nowhere near as cool. Neither as witty as ""The Hangover"" nor as clever as ""Back to the Future"", ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is your average comedy flick – fun, but forgettable. The film focuses on four friends who, bored with their everyday adult lives, take a road trip to Kodiak Valley - their home away from home where they would get drunk, smoke weed and party back in the good old 80s. Checking into their old hotel room they decide to get bare-ass in a hot tub together (laughing yet?) that also just happens to be a, um, time machine. Mayhem ensues as they find themselves back in 1986, and in their respective teenage bodies, given a chance to replay their youth. Now, don't get me wrong, this film ain't that bad. If you can get past the ridiculous plot and don't mind some extremely dodgy scenes, you'll probably have a good time. It's chockfull of sex jokes, slapstick and low-brow humour that's actually pretty funny. However, where the film falls short is in its execution. The film was clearly focused on squeezing every last laugh possible out of the audience that it lost focus on actually telling an engaging story. Sure, this works fine for the most part, but once u hit the 80 minute mark it all starts to get a bit stale and even the jokes start feeling a little forced. However, in the end, this movie is all about walking in with the right expectations. If you can realise that the film is not supposed to be taken seriously and can tolerate some crude, yet strangely funny, humour then you just may enjoy ""Hot Tub Time Machine"".",Hot Tub Time Machine

We saw the Hangover and hated, hated, hated it.

The laughs were all in the right spots, hit the right notes, and kept on coming. What more can you ask for in a comedy? What I particularly enjoyed was how they played off the clichés that are usually associated with time travel movies. Also, the eighties references weren't ridiculous; they were just enough to make it work, and it seems like the writers did a lot of weeding to pick only the jokes that worked. Very refreshing since there are so many idiotic comedies that think they're more funny than they are. John Cusack was good as always, and the rest of the cast did an excellent job. In fact, I think I could safely say that this was not a John Cusack movie, but rather an ensemble movie that didn't really have a weak link.

This movie is plain stupid, no character introduction, no character development and a story that a 7 year old could easily top in his first written sentence. I really had trouble understanding why John Cusack would star in such a movie. Finally getting past that idea due to the fact that he got a large amount of money for this movie, I'm starting to think he got paid extra for bad acting.

Now, I enjoyed hangover a lot, so I don't have a problem with the genre, or the childish jokes, but this was different. If you haven't seen it, the plot predictably has the 4 protagonists going back in time to the 80s and examines the incidents that made them what they are today, giving them opportunities to change history a sort of Back to the Future meets Knocked Up.

206,anita_ant_eater,Not so Nostalgic,6,12 May 2010,"I saw this today, in a not so packed screen. Not many people laughed out loud. I didn't laugh out loud much, only once or twice.I have my favourite bits in the film.Its not completely bad, its just very short, nothing much happens, and i don't think its very nostalgic because of the current trend at the moment to wear 80s related gear and 80's music. I still love Back to the Future. That's a full length feature film, but this is just a film for young adults/80's kids who want to remember some things.As we are all wearing 80s gear now it doesn't seem a surprise when we see it on screen.The bits that made me laugh out loud was the Hot Tub fixer when he spoke to the geeky bloke, he called her a little girl. And other funny bit was when Nick phoned up his 9 year old wife, lol.I like the ending, it was nice. That guy being the ""asshole"" friend turns out to be a good friend in the end. He changes his friend's lives as well as his own. The poor geeky guy, lol, must have felt adopted ! It could have been funnier, longer and more nostalgia tho!",Hot Tub Time Machine
207,rhwhirlwind,Phenomenal,9,18 December 2010,"This film was phenomenal it was one the best films i have ever seen. Now you might not listen to me because i giving to much praise but this was a hilarious film for older teen's and adults I mean it's funny at times and serious at times what I'm saying it nows when to stop being funny and be serious. the bad side is it contains very explicit sexual material and deserves its 18a rating, and it contains a butt load of loopholes, but if you view as a cartoon kinda film you don't care. this is a film that is worth spending $19.99 on at you local movie store or whatever because it's horribly awesome.It's not deserving of its 6.7 IMDb rating I give it a 8.9/10",Hot Tub Time Machine
208,rtrddk,Laughing my A* off. I think I peed a little.,8,5 December 2010,"This movie isn't as bad as everyone is saying. Yes, they cuss a lot but it's part of the characters they played who were disappointed with how their lives ended up (Would you be happy with a shriveled nut, you carry your wife's last name, or your girlfriend took your TV?). The story is good, you have the popular subject of time travel and the butterfly effect but instead of showing us how terrible it is to change something we are offered the possibility of something good that comes from it (Lougle or motley Lou). Which I thought was a bit refreshing to the idea of time travel making it less depressing and how they still managed to add in fate, in that somethings cannot be changed. It's got a lot of funny parts I loved Lou's music video at the end and his air drum solo in his car at the beginning of the movie. They also played Black Eyed Peas which was totally awesome they couldn't have picked a better song to play.",Hot Tub Time Machine
209,AGreatMomentInTheCulture,A melancholy experience that made me nostalgic for witty 80's comedies.,4,26 July 2011,"Three old friends realize that their character flaws outgrew whatever once made their friendship worthwhile. An apt metaphor for comedy's progress from sappy, witty, escapist, T&A-filled coming-of-age stories in the 80's to anti-intellectual, un-titillating gross-out contests like this, The Hangover, Knocked Up, or the 40-Year Old Virgin.Chevy Chase's vacant cameo made me sad for the man who made being an asshole so hilarious. Rob Corddry's pitiful asshole is amusing sometimes but lacks anything appealing, while John Cusack looks like he showed up at the wrong party. Although they are supposed to be old friends, the characters' relationships with one another have no depth, only teases of underlying complexity that are never developed.Despite the T&A and some cute girls, it lacks the fun and the warm, witty coming-of-age feelings that made 80's comedies what they were. I'm going to go listen to some New Wave and feel sorry for myself.",Hot Tub Time Machine

211,ItsTheMovieGoEr,"Gross, yet incredibly entertaining",7,6 November 2014,"Can a movie get anymore ridiculous than this one? Yes, we have Sharknado (and a sequel now), not the point. This movie has one of the craziest most ""out-there"" plots I've seen in awhile, but despite this it is an engaging and entertaining film that will be sure to choke some half- hearted laughs from you. The acting is well-done, not incredible but still far from terrible, the characters are in some strange, freaky way likable, the film portrays time travel in a simple, understandable way, the overall movie is good. This movie ties in old-school references, such as a line about 21 Jump Street (the original TV series) with an incredible 80's soundtrack, a very satisfying ending, and a few very annoying unexplained inside jokes. The character development is shallow with the extent of it being what they did when they were at the peak of their ""game"" and hollow introduction to the best friends. One thing that was very well done in this move was the time travel. Hot Tub Time Machine kept the time travel subject simple and mostly explainable, where many other films make the mistake of going to in-depth and can leave major plot holes *coughLoopercough*. If you don't find gross, sexual humor funny this is not the movie for you. If you don't like wacky, odd plots this isn't the movie for you. If you don't like 80's fashion this is not the movie for you.",Hot Tub Time Machine
212,trinigeleon,Nonsense and Plot Holes.... but I Like It!,7,17 June 2010,"First off, let me say that I did rather enjoy this film.Yes, it is a rather (read: VERY) far-fetched premise. And yes, it does have some massive plot holes mainly because it completely disregards the space-time continuum. But this film is not designed to have you focus on these things. It is only after viewing that you realise just how stupid the whole thing is and where all the problems with time-lines etc, etc lie. Yet, I still found myself wanting to see it again.The main characters play their parts very well. All the actors must have known exactly what they were getting themselves into and they are all willing participants. I did especially enjoy Rob Corddry's part as a washed up, dead end, dead beat alcoholic. His character was the fulcrum for the majority of the humour, both situational and verbal. Craig Robinson bought the light-hearted humour, as well as some of the best punch lines of the film. John Cusack played the 'serious' dramatic/comedic role and Clark Duke has his moments while helping to aim the whole package toward a younger demographic. Even the secondary characters have their moments of comedy glory.There are genuine laugh out loud moments spread pretty evenly throughout which are based on plot and character, not just gross-out humour. And although gross-out humour is present it sits well because the film doesn't rely on it alone to deliver the laughs.Another thing I found very entertaining about this movie was that as the characters travelled back to the 80's it was almost as if the humour did too. I don't mean to say that things descended into a 'Porkie's Revisited' or anything like that, but there were definite elements of the 80's present in the way the humour and characters come across. Think back to scenes you remember off the top of your head from Back To The Future, Caddy Shack, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, hell - even Breakfast Club. Hot Tub Time Machine just seemed to capture some of that and revive it for today's audiences.I would recommend HTTM to anyone with a sense of humour not wanting to think too deeply and wanting to be entertained for 90 minutes.Like I said at the top of this review... There are plot holes. There is no recognition of the space-time continuum - actually, the future repercussions of the character's actions would have never worked out like they do. And, really, at no point does the film actually make sense.BUT... I was still entertained. I still laughed. I still wanted to see where the characters went. I still find myself remembering lines from the film and smiling. And, even after all I've just written, I'd still watch it again.Can't say more than that now, can I?",Hot Tub Time Machine
213,kelvin_butler78,I joined especially to review this movie,1,9 June 2010,"I always use this website to check before watching a movie, and this movie got above 7, so I figured why not. Especially considering the reviewer on the first page said he laughed through the entire movie. I only cringed and constantly found myself throwing up in my mouth a little at each attempt at 'comedy'. I am truly dumbfounded how this movie has scored higher than a three or possibly a four on this site. If this is the kind of movie that can get above 7, I truly wonder how many people paid to produce and act in it were also FORCED to register on this site and give it a 10 to boost the ratings, because it is utter garbage trash, not funny at all, who would ever say yes to acting in it, omg it was terrible. 1/10To my credit I fast forwarded through a lot of it because the dialog was also utter bs, and not worth wasting my time to listen to. Characters however were very well formed throughout the movie. Yeah, right. I would say that if a 2 year old directed/wrote the movie, otherwise, all I can ask is, why????",Hot Tub Time Machine
214,sehwan-cheon,Movie went so well until...,6,22 January 2013,"The movie provides for many laughs, enjoyable twists in the plot, and a generally appreciable film. My only problem, which hit me pretty hard and still leaves a mark in brain - is that the writer drove themselves to a point where they could not come to a plausible conclusion/ending. Objectively speaking, the reason that the protagonists found some happiness in the 'modern day' lives was all thanks due to what can honestly be construed as 'fraud' and IP infringement. Yes, I realize a comedy should be viewed as a comedy and movie may just be a movie (although this second part I can't generally agree with), but what is the film trying to say? That time travel will never happen, so this type of criminal business activity can't take place and is just simply enjoyable? That you should work for your and your friends' happiness by all means and since the whole ""space time continuum"" is rearranged anyway? Or how about ""by all means"" leading to fraud and other criminal activities? A bit too serious, yes, but these were the thoughts that the plot nevertheless stuck to my mind, for what was otherwise an enjoyable, lounging-aid, pass-time film. Probably would have given it a 7.5 or 8 if the conclusion had been less culpable, but I'm taking off 2,3 points due to how much that 'hole' affected my viewing experience.",Hot Tub Time Machine
215,lawrencejarvis,Does what it says on the tin!!,7,8 December 2010,"I watched Hot Tub Time Machine this past Sunday without knowing too much about it, I hadn't seen any trailers I'd just heard a couple of people mention it and thought I'd try it out.I was pleasantly surprised, I'm a big fan of Craig Robinson in comedies and found him just as good. Rob Corddry is the funniest guy in this film by quite a substantial margin and delivers brilliantly. John Cusack delivers another steady performance and Clark Duke plays nerdy Jacob well.It's pretty much what it is, a hot tub time machine that takes the guys back to the 80's which they visited as young men (excluding Jacob).The film is consistently funny and one part which includes somewhat of a twist/surprise had me rolling on the sofa. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to buy this film but if it was on TV or a friend had it on DVD I would definitely sit through it again for some of the big laughs of which there are plenty.I didn't really have any gripes about this film as I didn't expect too much from it, I think if you go in with a relatively open mind and just want something to watch this is a good choice.",Hot Tub Time Machine

Those who absolutely HATE a movie and wish to warn others. 2. Those who absolutely LOVE a movie and wish to rant and rave.Hot Tube Time Machine is a rare movie that I first hated, then loved and now I own. I saw this movie when it came out on video in 2010. I work in a video rental place. The concept of time travel has always fascinated me especially after watching movies like Back To The Future. The premise is simple. I won't dwell on the story. I thought the movie was crude and sexual and downright yucky especially when there is vomit humor and toilet humor. That turned me off and I signed off on it. One year later, on thanksgiving I bought this movie for $5 on Blu-ray. I figured I'd watch it one more time and if I don't like it, I'll return it.I saw the movie one half hour at a time. I really enjoyed it this way. I was able accept the crude humor and vomit jokes in short increments. The third time I watched it, I fell in love. This comedy is along the same lines as American Pie, Fired up, 40 year old virgin, etc. I've decided to keep the blu ray disc in my collection and I'd highly recommend you check your brain at the door and enjoy the wild ride.

I was in the mood for a good old fashion comedy. I needed a good laugh. I was laughing the whole time in the movie theater. From the beginning when Lou drives into the garage jamming out to Motley Crue to the end when Jacob Nick and Adam are watching Lou in the video. I did predict that Lou was going to be Jacobs father but that did not bother me since the rest of the movie was hysterical. Especially, when Nick is realizing what is going on and where they actually are. I loved the cameo of Chevy Chase as the repairman. That was a great surprise when he walked into the hotel room.

221,elizmarchetti-00410,How could anyone make a movies set in the 80s so goddamn boring?!,1,23 October 2020,"So, this is my first ever imdb review but it had to be done. Don't waste your time watching this terrible film. I can't believe all the rave reviews I am reading. I just rewatched this movie after a long time because of a reference in ""30 Rock"" and believe me, the joke about Hot Tub Time Machine is 1000 times funnier than this ridiculous bore. Thank you Tina Fey!Firstly, I'm a millennial so I didn't live in the 80s but I love the decade, especially the music and the films. I have a thing for coming-of-age movies, and I am guessing the whole point of this film was to do an anti-coming of age somehow and do the reverse. Place a bunch of dudes who are sad and bitter about their lives in the 80s. So, it's not a bad idea as a concept but the execution is totally flat. With such fun material to work with, HOW can anyone make such a boring film about the eighties - seriously? The pacing is all off. Nothing big happens the first half of the film then towards the finale we have everything speeds up and the ending is wrapped up in 15 ridiculous minutes. Oh and it's supposed to be a comedy? It's not funny! The jokes are crass and not funny, mainly sexual references. There are maybe a couple of ""haha"" moments but that's it.My biggest question and for me huge flaw is this: if you went back in time and could relieve your youth for a night, stuck in your teenage body, wouldn't you actually want to enjoy it a bit and have a bit of fun? Instead of having a wild time, these guys spend the entirety of the film running around worried about trying to get back to the future and completely not even that bothered about the fact that they are relieving their youth. Instead they spend the whole goddamn film running around to find some kind of energy drink, and moping around, telling everyone about their sad little lives and cussing at each other for being terrible friends. YAWN. The ending is just too ridiculous! Ludicrous. Could they have at least made the effort to age the wives? Not even that. They still look like high school girls with more make up. Seriously.There is absolutely nothing salvageable in this film. Not the costumes, which are ridiculously tacky. Not even the soundtrack, which could have been SO much better (""Jesse's Girl?"" ""True?"" Is that the best they can get from the repertoire of 80s anthems and classics? A funny Motley Crue rendition?!). Not even the spunky and adorable Lizzy Caplan. Sure, we have John Cusack playing himself as always. That's cool. But the other characters, I couldn't care less about. I am not invested in the characters. There are so many plot holes. The script is awful, all the protagonists are boring sexist assholes and all the women in this film are a pure commodity. They are absolute cliches, from the out-of-control blonde promiscuous chick, to the manic pixie dream girl (brunette and an artsy music journalist, of course!) who breaks into people's homes for fun and changes the protagonist's life with a few wise words. Gimme a break. Basically, THIS FILM STINKS FROM START TO FINISH.If you want real 80s throwback films with actual heart, good music and loveable characters, try ""Sing Street"" or ""13 Going on 30"". Even ""Adventureland"" was better despite Kirsten Stewart's acting.",Hot Tub Time Machine

223,vasametropolis,You need to take a soak in this hot tub!,8,28 March 2010,"I've been waiting for this movie ever since the trailer, and it easily met my expectations. It's absolutely hilarious, which is completely due to the great on screen chemistry between all the characters. It also has a heart, which a lot of people won't see because it is so well hidden, but it is there. The message is obvious and clear, and we've all heard it before, but the film uses a completely outrageous context to give it the most enjoyable spin I could have ever hoped for.Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson COMPLETELY steal the show in my opinion, but Cusack fit in just perfectly. If I had to compare this to other films, I would say it falls in the Harold and Kumar category, as opposed to the Apatow crowd, and Phillips crowd respectively. I LOVE this because I often feel overwhelmed by all the Apatow-ish movies that exist out there right now.Hot Tub Time Machine is not perfect of course, but it's damn near close for a movie with a title like this. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun in a movie theatre, and the 80's references will leave you bursting out laughing until the very end.

224,filmchic32,Should I get in the hot tub? YEAH!,8,29 March 2010,"As a narrative work, HTTM falls well short of great. Technically speaking, the production quality pales in comparison to recent hits like the Hangover and most of the Vaughn or Apatow releases. I can name at least a half dozen comedies from recent years that are better movies. And yet, somehow, someway, somewhere...perhaps aided by some Russian RedBull, the ghost of John Hughes, Poison and a hell of a lot of blow, HTTM friggen ROCKS.Caught the film in a 70% full theater along with a fellow late 30's female colleague and we both howled from start to finish. The film may not be as accessible to the 21 and under set unless they grew up with elder siblings and caught some of the 80's by proxy. On the same note, 50 and overs will likely wrinkle their noses unless they spent more time playing in the 80's than playing grown up. Channelling Lloyd Dobler, Cusack is in rare form at the top of the cast. Craig Robinson and Corddry are not far behind as the group gels together in a way that makes their imperfect friendship all so believable. Perhaps shotgunned out of a plutonium powered DeLorean, Crispin Glover makes a triumphant return with a one-note gag that somehow never gets old. It would not surprise me to see him back in vogue as a top flight character actor once again.While it may fall short of a comedy classic, HTTM is simply a riot. If you judge the quality of a comedy on how frequently and heartily it makes you laugh, HTTM is a winner.",Hot Tub Time Machine

How wrong I was and how the hell did it get 7.2??? For starters it just wasn't funny, I was cringing throughout. The main characters I think had worked out early that this would be rubbish, were clearly bored and had decided to have a game of who could swear the most, they all tied on 245 each. I noticed that John Cusack also produced this, like others have said he must have seen those dollar signs because normally he's great to watch but even he can't save this one.

'hot tub time machine', however, seems intent on being semi-serious half the time and semi-funny the rest of the time. Chevy chase adds nothing to the movie. perhaps because most of the time he is a funny guy because he seems to be funny while acting like he isn't. so in this case he fits right in, and he really isn't funny, or serious, or anything. the only reason i didn't walk out was i had the night off and wasn't expected home so i didn't want to just go home. what a waste of time.",Hot Tub Time Machine

The location was a bit limiting as not all viewers can empathise with a skiing vacation unlike the town of say Back to the Future with its Mom and Pops and trappings of the common small city that most people can relate to. The resort set was not utilised to its fullest potential and seemed miniaturised and crammed into the camera frame, even the concert crowd was pathetic in quantity.

It has jokes of all varieties and some good comedy from the ever classic Chevy Chase. Each character is well thought out and believable and the acting is great.If you can watch this movie and put aside the fact that realism is tossed out with the title, the rest of the movie is great. I personally find it to be one of the 5 best comedies of all time and I watch it once a month.

234,peter-vast,"Low expectations, but delivers laughs by the tub full and so much more!",9,11 July 2013,"Low expectations, but delivers laughs by the tub full! So much so, in fact, that this movie has been added to my multiple watch list, as the only comedy on that list. It wins multiple views not so much because of the gross out gags (most of which are dealt with fairly early on) or because of the heavy 80's references and irony (which I loved, but that's probably a generational thing), but because of the clever scenario based comedy, the interplay between the characters, the characters themselves, and the performances of all the lead and most of the support characters, which are mostly above and beyond what you would expect from a comedy that shameless paints itself the basest of base, although it's far from it.There are so many stand out moments, and stand out performances, and stand out situations, and stand out gags, that the pace, quality or quantity of laughs doesn't stop. Blaine's character is distressingly similar to someone pretty much anyone who grew up in the 80's would have known, and the many truths painted (although exaggerated somewhat) and presented in this movie holds a mirror up to not just the 80's but every decade, demonstrating how ridiculous our material aspirations can make us when we take a step back a look at ourselves.This movie deliberately pretends to be a dumb gag movie, and while achieving that aim perfectly, it does it in a clever and genuinely original way that the movie title would never suggest.Nick's challenging look to the camera while he delivers the line ""it's like ... some kind of hot tub time machine"" sums up the originality & pretence of simplicity. It's one of many defining moments this movie offers.I know it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but the characters portrayed alone justify a watch even if you are opposed to 'this kind of movie' (even though it isn't). For example, Lou, the washed up protagonist dreamer is a masterful creation and is played masterfully indeed - ""he's an arsehole, but he's our arsehole"" as Adam so succinctly states while the scene is being set.What the movie does, is looks at our youthful dreams and holds a light to them in the context of our current lives. That it can do this so well, make all of us look back and remember, and think 'what if' is a credit to the scriptwriters of a 'dumb gag' movie that many will dismiss based on the title alone. Therein lies the irony.",Hot Tub Time Machine
235,msco89,Very funny and moderately raunchy flick.,8,24 March 2010,"I went to an advanced screening of HTTM tonight in Phoenix, AZ. I was able to get a free pass for two people from a local smoke shop(weird I know). I have followed this movie since they announced it and was stoked to see the finished product.I was not let down. I was greeted with a moderately raunchy and for the most part funny movie. Rob Corddry and Clark Duke definitely steal the show. Their on-screen spats/confrontations will leave most audience members laughing so hard they almost cry. John Cusack and Craig Robinson are also funny but I found them to be more akin to a ""second stage"" performance. They were very funny but had more ""touching realization"" moments than lol humor. I felt Chevy Chase was greatly underused but Crispin Glover made me laugh every time he was on screen. Short and Vague for you potential viewers of this film.",Hot Tub Time Machine
236,jorgefn,"A stupid movie, with stupid characters,in a Hot Tub Time Machine...no more words!",7,20 January 2016,"This movie is an amazing discovery. All the clichés, the old same jokes, and the recyclable characters in every comedy movie are here; a stupid story about three middle age best friends that travel to the past with one millennial antisocial nerd.Maybe describing this movie with all these elements might make it sound like a predictable and horrible comedy crap. But Hot Tub Time Machine has perfect timing jokes, the accurate pop culture reference and fabulous personalities in each character, that put together result in two hours of classic 00's comedy. Guaranteed. John Cusack is Adam, a frustrated and egocentric, mildly economically successful guy, that lives with his nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), a nerd that interacts with other people only in Second Life, in which he is also a loser. Then, one of his old friends, Lou (Rob Corddry), tries to commit suicide. So, Adam, Jacob, and Nick (Craig Robins) – other friend from high school, and the black guy every comedy needs- decide to take their suicidal and failed friend to Kodiak Valley, the pinnacle of youngster parties in the 80's, nowadays transformed into a decadent ghost town. Here is where this four underdogs find a hot tub that transports them to 1986, at the same Kodiak Valley camp. The three friends –Adam, Jacob and Lou- have to do exactly the same things they originally did in order to maintain the present undamaged. The other guy, Jacob, wasn't even born yet, so he just wants to go back to the present.Well, in their effort to keep the past unchanged, these three losers realize that they have the opportunity to transform their dreadful future with all the information they have. And that's exactly what they do, taking this movie to a happy, ridiculously and incredibly stupid ending; with a new master web searcher named Louggle included. You may think this is just bullshit, and that I can be easily amazed. But give it a try, believe me, Hot Tub Time Machine is the movie you're looking for when you don't have much to do.",Hot Tub Time Machine
237,floydyboy1,Don't waste your time,3,29 January 2011,"Only got this movie because of John Cusack. My wife and I were dumbfounded as to why he agreed to to it. Maybe one or two scenes brought a faint smile to both of us but the writing was beyond juvenile. No really good jokes were offered, they just seemed to rely on saying the ""F"" word to get laughs and not being 13, the ""F"" word is really not that funny anymore. The actors tried, but the writer's just didn't give them anything to say that was even close to funny. Chevy Chase's best line was a fart. Apparently they were trying to cash in on success of ""Hangover"", but they failed miserably. Do yourself a favor and let this one pass by.",Hot Tub Time Machine

It was absolutely brilliant, but you had to have been alive in the 80's to TRULY enjoy all the references that are sprinkled throughout this movie. Rob Corddry goes completely against his previous typecasting, as the wimpy guy who gets bossed around by his girlfriend. He's the exact opposite in this movie, and he does a wonderful job. Jon Cusack does justice to his 80's movie pedigree. The feel of this movie is very much like The Hangover. A bunch of friends who come together to raise a little mayhem over the weekend, end up getting much more than what they bargained for. The comedy is superb, even though it's often sophomoric in nature. If you're in the mood to laugh like a hyena, and bask in the gloriousness of the 80's, then look no further. I can't wait to re-watch this movie on DVD. We were all laughing so hard, that I missed TONS of dialogue. There are also LOTS of 80's references, and familiar faces from the era, that make this movie so unbelievably fun to watch. Not to mention, give it excellent replay value.

My girlfriend and I both thought that the movie was going to be terrible, but were pleasantly surprised only 10-15 minutes into the movie. The obvious ""lower than normal"" budget made the moments funnier and the whole movie that much more memorable. Between all the completely unnecessary nudity and drug use, the film also depicts deeper rooted problems that all the characters are going through. We left the theater still cracking up about the entire movie. Craig Robinson performs superbly without the support of Seth Rogen and Rob Corddry is positively hilarious. This movie rivals ""The Hangover"" in more ways than one and in some instances is even better. This movie is an instant classic and a must-see.",Hot Tub Time Machine

There were some ""heart warming"" parts too. I did see this for free but I definitely think I would pay to go see it. I definitely would put this movie pretty high on my list.

The movie is extremely well-written. John Cusack really carries the movie with a great performance. Chevy Chase really doesn't do much of anything. Comedy was sort of in the vein of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" The film doesn't take itself seriously at all, which is part of the fun. It doesn't really get bogged down too much in the science of time travel, and focuses mostly on these four guys trying to get the hell out of 1986. A great watch. Very entertaining.

The story line was surprisingly more intricate that I thought it would be from seeing the previews.

I was even thinking about it today and chuckling at the different quirks.It might not be a 1st date movie, unless you know the other person is into potty humor but it was great for us or a group of friends. It was fun to see which friend you might be in the group. If you don't think that your group has one of the main characters (Lou) or that loose sister... than you might be that character. It was also fun to see the movie make fun of (or just point out) the things that we used to do in the 80's when new technology started.

When i got in, it was crowded, hot, noisy and hard to hear the movie. I was already in a bad mood and then i watched the movie and the jokes are jokes you hear over and over and over again. How many times can you laugh at the same thing. I am wondering if it was me or if it was the fact that it was a crowded theater, hot and I was treated lousy by an amateur screening group of incompetents letting little brats inside. word of advice, if you get a pre-screening to a movie, how much is a movie really worth to wait on a line for an hour and a half just to be dealt with by imbeciles.

246,rjacops,Vulgar Reptitiveness - AWFUL,2,29 March 2010,"When I saw all the good reviews on this movie, I thought this was a ""can't miss"" movie. Boy was I wrong. This movie really had potential with the whole 80s theme and the reputable cast (Cusack and ""The Office"" dude). The first 10 minutes got me thinking this was going to be a great comedy. I was expecting something on the order of ""Tommy Boy"", ""Rat Race"", or even ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"". Sadly, it fell fall short of all these expectations. I would even rate ""Bio-Dome"" (with Pauly Shore) higher than this movie.The movie quickly fell into a repeating pattern of vulgarity. F-word this, F-word that. And the drug and alcohol use was just plain ridiculous. Just about every drug seemed to have been used and was in about every scene...I can understand some drug use for reality purposes, but honestly who could drink continually, do cocaine, hit a bong, & smoke cigars all within a relatively short time period and still function? It was just so ridiculous that I honestly do not see what the point of it all was.The sexual overtone was likewise ridiculous. I mean these characters would just be sitting by themselves and some hot chick would walk up and want to take them back to their private room and do them on the spot. I mean that's cool and all if that's your thing to see unrealistic and animal like humping, but it was quite far-fetched and the characters had no believable chemistry. Coupling this with the other vulgar content, my wife & I were just totally turned off.In general, this movie had a lot of potential and I was highly disappointed. The characters left me thinking I would never want to associate with anyone like that. How can you laugh at someone doing such ridiculously stupid and potentially fatally harmful things? And how many times can you laugh at the same thing over and over and over and over again?! I thought maybe I just don't get it, but everyone else in the fairly full theater was pretty quiet. There were a few regular laughers, but they sounded like your typical uneducated 18 year horny guy. It's sad because there are probably a lot of kids that think this kind of behavior is funny and admirable. The plethora of good reviews really got me thinking there was some kind of conspiracy to hype this movie. If so, they sure duped me.BTW, I've never written a review but felt I had to do my duty to warn you. If you must see it, at least save your $$ and wait for DVD.",Hot Tub Time Machine

It really makes me sad that nobody in Hollywood is intelligent enough to make a real comedy.

248,runswithpaper,An enjoyable film. (Mild Spoiler),7,13 April 2010,"Over all, it was a very enjoyable film. I really appreciated what the film tried to do and what it did achieve. It was indefinitely a comedy and one might even go as far as to say a ""period piece"" in the loosest possible manner.Although the film itself was basically about camaraderie and being given that ultimate chance to change the past (a universal feeling, I'm sure), I had a hard time feeling attached to the characters, particularly the character Jacob. Though he added a nice balance to the time traveling group, after a while I found him to be a bit selfish and at times, annoying. I even sympathize with him, being a avid video game player myself but, he should have perhaps considered the magnitude of the situation in the fact that these men were being given a second chance to change all that went wrong in their life. Well, maybe not all that went wrong but, something that was unresolved in their life.However, this is probably looking too deep into a film that is meant to be taken as a light-heart comedy and that is indeed what it is. Although certain scenes seemed brief and how seemingly randomly the hot tub would start to boil with time traveling power, even the shady and commonly used storm effect when something major is about to happen was perhaps intentional. A satire on clichés used in film making today.I wouldn't suggest seeing this with your Parents, well, for obvious reasons in the film that I'd much rather not spoil and for those who have seen it, will know of what I am referring to.",Hot Tub Time Machine

The way I see it you evaluate what the 'strive' was and gauge the 'mark'. Personally, I believe this movie hit on all accounts. True, there was an excess of the F-bomb, but if you remember 80's movies, most used excessive language. It was a decade thang. I remember pulling out ""Stand By Me"" for my boys to watch and being a little embarrassed when the the language turned colorful just a few minutes into the film. I use it just as an example of other 80's films such as ""Weird Science"", ""Fresh Horses"" and ""St. Elmo's Fire"".Overall, it was a pretty cool ride down memory lane. Sure the leg warmers and over-sized mobile phones point at the era, but more-so it's Cusack and Glover in roles that serve as smirky reminders of what made the 80's funny. To compare it with a modern psyche would be to miss the point. Face it, if you were to release This Is Spinal Tap today, most folks wouldn't get it. If you were a child of the 80's, who didn't live under a rock, this movie delivers a nostalgic vibe. That's more than most I've seen lately.",Hot Tub Time Machine

This movie is what would happen if Back to the Future and The Hangover came together. All in all, a great movie. Although, when a review of this movie said that it had the usual vulgarity, I thought it meant poop jokes and stuff like that. It was a bit too dirty. Every minute of the movie, somebody dropped an f bomb, like three times. Also, there was too much dirty comments and such. All the dirtiness sort of ruined the jokes. The actors were great in their parts. I loved all the lame 80s' references and jokes. I loved the cheesy rendition of the ultimate 80s' song, Jessie's Girl.

But this garbage was not funny. Bad directing, bad acting, and really badly written. It had to much potential to be funny and they ruined it by putting a TON of gross and bad language in it. Hey writers, just b/c you use the Fword 1000 times doesn't mean its a funny line. Had this garbage of a script ever get approved by anyone that it was a ""good idea"" is beyond me.

253,hetter03,This film is about three friends and a nephew that set out to have a good time and break away from their boring dead-end lives.,6,15 September 2010,"The movie, Hot Tub Time Machine, really took me back to the 80's with the big hair, leg warmers, and raised collars. The movie begins with three friends, Adam (John Cusack), Lou (Rob Corddry), and Nick (Craig Robinson) who are all dissatisfied with the way their lives turned out. After Lou's failed suicide attempt inhaling exhaust fumes, the three distant friends along with Adam's nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) decide to go to Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, where the three friends had the best times of their lives in the 80's. After a drunken night in the hot tub, they wake to find themselves on the last night of their trip from back in the 80's. Everything was the way it used to be. Even their reflections were them back when they were teenagers.In order to get their current lives back, they must relive the past exactly like they did before to make sure they get their current lives back and to make sure that Jacob was born. Since Jacob's mom is at the Resort as well, Jacob may be able to find out who his father is. I thought it was hilarious for Jacob to see his mom they way she was in the 80's, before he was born.Adam, Lou and Nick all have a difficult time reliving their past since they knew that it would lead to their terrible future. After a few minor changes in all of their lives, they finally get back to the hot tub in time to get their lives back to current day. Jacob even finds out that his father is Lou. Lou decides that he isn't happy with his current life and ends up not getting back in the hot tub. Since his future changes and he becomes rich in his ""new"" life, that changes everyone else's life too. Lou and Jacob's mom are married and Adam ends up with a reporter that he met when they were reverted back to the 80's. Nick is happier with his not so controlling wife.There were many motifs for this film. The idea of the guys looking in the mirror and seeing a younger image of themselves and why they didn't want to go back to their current lives are examples. The director, Steve Pink, didn't pay special attention to angles and lighting since the film was so hilariously silly. The film was definitely not taken too seriously. I would compare the costume and makeup to movies such as The Wedding Singer. The afro that Adam Sandler had and the way the girls had the big hair and heavy metal t-shirts was definitely 80's throwback.I definitely think this movie is worth watching, but the viewer should not go into it with high expectations of being a well-written film. However, if you're looking for a good laugh and don't take offense to rude and crude humor, this is definitely the film to see.",Hot Tub Time Machine
254,dasweetestinohio,Modern Day Time Traveling,10,21 September 2010,"Have you ever thought about your past and said to yourself ""If I could do X, Y, and Z all over again I would change.""? Well imagine being able to go back into the past and having the opportunity to change fate. This is exactly what Hot Tub Time Machine is all about.This film is centered on four friends who live rather dull and boring adult lives. The film stars Rob Corddry (Lou Dorchen) who is the comedian in the group. He keeps you laughing from the time he is introduced to the movie to the time that the movie is over. It also stars John Cusack (Adam) who seems to have a rather hard time keeping a girlfriend. Then there is Craig Robinson (Nick Webber), whom you can tell hates his job working in a fancy doggy parlor. Last, but not least you have Clark Duke (Jacob), who is the nerd out of the group. He is Adams nephew who does nothing but sit in the basement playing computer games and texting. He is in his early twenties and has absolutely no social life.After one of the friends has a suicide attempt, the friends decide to take a trip to a ski resort called Codiak Valley. This resort has lots of good and bad memories for the guys. However, this particular weekend will be one to remember forever as the guys get an unsuspected surprise.A night of partying in the hot tub, the guys awake to discover that the hot tub is also a time machine. On this weekend ski trip the guys discover why their adult lives are the way that they are today. In order to not mess up time the guys decide that they must reenact everything that happened on that exact same weekend back in 1986.Lou decides that he will have a little fun while being back in the eighties. He also realizes that this means facing a past situation that he blocked out in his adult life. However, what he doesn't realize is that this time around he could change fate so that it betters his future.Unlike Lou, Adam remembers what he did on that night back in eighty-six and wants to try and change it. He believes that if he changes it then maybe it could ultimately make him happier in the future. What he discovers is that fate can't be tampered with no matter how you try and alter it.Then there is Nick. Nick's situation is a little bit different than the other guys. When Nick gets back to the eighties he remembers how much fun he had and how alive it made him feel. The only problem is that he can't let go of a situation that he is dealing with in the future. He ends up bringing it into the eighties with him and making a complete fool of himself. Actually, it was pretty hilarious.Lastly, there is Jacob. Jacob, is kind of along for the ride, especially being he wasn't even born in eighty-six. His character can be rather annoying in the film. He doesn't want to have any fun and he rains on everyone's parade. I guess he was in a hurry to get back to the future and play those video games in his uncle's basement. Despite the fact that he wasn't present at this festival in the past, he does however discover some really disturbing news that will change his life forever.This film reminds me of a modern day Back to the Future. The only exceptions are that Hot Tub Time Machine was way funnier and had better special effects. Speaking of special effects I believe that the angle of the camera in Hot Tub Time Machine helped to strengthen the special effects. For instance, there is a scene when the guys first get into the hot tub and they are partying and drinking. The camera does a really good job of zooming in on each character individually and then panning out a little bit so that you can look at them as a group. It then cuts angles back and forth between the guys and the controller pad that controls the hot tub. If you're paying close attention to this scene the camera allows you to observe what happened to the controller pad that caused it to send the guys back into the eighties.The film also presented a special motif that was present throughout the film. The theme of the film was time traveling back into the eighties and having a chance to change your fate so that it betters your future. However, through out the film the director Steve Pink did a good job of allowing the viewer to see the difference between the time eras. The film did a good job of distinguishing between the present era and the eighties era. For example, in the scene in which the guys have realized that something is wrong, Nick notices that the girls are wearing leg warmers, guys are wearing jerry curls, one guy is listening to a cassette player, etc. Everything screams the eighties.Although this movie was quite hilarious, it makes you stop think about two things: What would you change if you had the chance? Also, what time period would you go back to if you could time travel with a Hot Tub Time Machine?",Hot Tub Time Machine
255,knad04,Funny movie if you like crude humor.,8,28 October 2010,"Here is a quick plot summary and there is nothing revealing about how the movie ends. The movie Hot Tub Time Machine is about three friends Adam (played by John Cusack) Nick (played by Craig Robinson) and Lou (played by Rob Corddry) who all are not happy with their lives, so they decide to go back to Kodiak Valley, a city they had many good times at growing up. When they get there they find out the city is not what it used to but they try to make the best of it anyway. They get into the rooms hot tub and end up going back in time to 1986 when they were there for Winter Fest 86. They decide to do everything they did that night as to not set off the future but they are tempted to do things different to try and change their futures because of how unhappy they are.This movie is extremely funny and leaves you wondering about the decisions you made in your own life when you are done watching. I would say the theme of this movie is also a little lesson and that would be go for your goals and dreams because if you don't you may end up wondering ""what if?"" for the rest of your life just like Adam, Nick, and Lou did throughout the whole movie.There are a couple of scenes that stand out to me that go along with the theme and the first one is when Adam is supposed to break up with his girlfriend at the time Jenny. The only problem is Adams girlfriend in present time just left him so he is stuck wondering what could have been if he never broke up with Jenny.The second one is when Nick gets up on stage to sing at the club. He gets up on stage and sees all the people looking at he is nervous at first but he ends up putting on a show. The lights are shining down on him, the music is loud, and the crowd is going crazy. He already regretted giving up singing but after this scene he is never quite the same, he talks about wishing he never gave it up for the rest of the movie.If you have not seen this movie and can put up with a little nudity and crude humor I would suggest seeing it. This movie has a bunch of laughs and really makes you think about your own dreams and your own goals.",Hot Tub Time Machine

After traveling back in time through the hot tub, craziness ensues and the men's lives will never be the same again. While the movie is called Hot Tub Time Machine, the theme of the movie is much deeper than a hot tub or time travel. The question of going back and redoing things differently in life is the main theme. If given the chance, would you change what you did knowing it would change who you become? This is the question Adam, Nick, and Lou faced and the movie answered the questions in a very comical way.Throughout the movie Jacob is constantly trying to keep everyone together to find a way to get home while Adam, Nick, and Lou are realizing they have the power to change what they did in the past and do what they wanted to or should have done. Adding the movie is the director's, Steve Pink, use of color. When the guys started to realize they had traveled back in time, the bright neon pants, coats, and t-shirts are one of the first things they notice. Also, the film is set at a ski resort with lots of snow everywhere. Color is needed to add dimension to the film which is what is achieved by the use of benches and bars throughout, just to add some color and depth. The transition scene from present day to 1986 in the hot tub is a constant rotation of the guy's night of drinking in the hot tub to guys wearing different president's masks to taking shots and then back to them drinking. The rotating shot continues as the dial on the hot tub counts backwards into the 80s. This technique allows the audience to see what happened that night in the hot tube while also transitioning smoothly into the new setting and the next scene. The movie ends with Adam, Nick, and Jacob going back to the present day and Lou, realizing he isn't happy with his life decides to stay in 1986. Back in present day, they realize Lou has become a millionaire by stealing the idea for Google and becoming the lead singer of the band Motley Crue. Nick is happily married to his faithful wife Courtney (Kellee Stewart), Adam is married to April (Lizzy Caplan), and Jacob discovers his father is Lou.Much like Back to the Future, Hot Tub Time Machine deals with changing the past and its affects on the future. Through many funny moments, Time Machine is a genuinely funny movie with a lot of great laughs and a very interesting question, would you change the past if you could?",Hot Tub Time Machine
257,dominick-antonucci,Heterosexist and should be protested as such,1,1 December 2010,"From ""'Gay' is not Lame"": So why let people get away with saying it? by Patrick Ryan, Out magazine, December 2010, page 73: ... ""The main characters (all male) repeatedly toss the term 'gay' around as an insult, but -- and this is where the phenomenon of the G word is taken full -circle -- the insult here is that the accused might actually be homosexual and that homosexuality is repulsive. The entire middle stretch of the film hangs on the possibility that one of the characters might be forced -- at gunpoint, no less -- to give his friend a blow job. The characters consider *dying* rather than blowing a dude. The audience in Denver, filled with straight couples of all ages, howled with laughter. When it seemed, at one point, as if the blow job had actually occurred, they howled with disgust.""The homophobia is so obviously coming from the total masculine inferiority of the main characters,"" John Cusak, who both starred in and co-produced the film, fold 'Entertainment Weekly'. ""I mean, homophobia is funny because it's the ultimate fear of so many guys. Like, God forbid they should be gay!""This reasoning is skewed and wildly irresponsible. ......""and how we (gays) are denigrated in the media for the sake of humor.OK -- I haven't seen the film, but, as a gay man, I would have had to leave. WTF?! There is nothing 'funny' about the idea that someone is gay. It's also not something to be grateful one isn't. It's not 'less than' in any sense, and I really can't see how there's any possible humor in any such joking -- unless it's to be ugly. Cusak's 'explanation' is bogus. Those watching only could have found it funny if they too regarded gay as gross and something you wouldn't want to be. This is pathetic, especially at a time when the youth suicides are in the media. Obviously, to come out is difficult, it's even necessary, precisely because there seem to be so many people around who will think poorly of you (and worse) because of that knowledge. Awful.",Hot Tub Time Machine
258,clbradbury,Utter garbage,1,18 September 2021,"I made an account just to sign in and review this movie, it was the biggest piece of garbage I have seen in a while. The whole premise of grown ass men going back in time to have sex with teenage girls is repulsive. It was misogynistic, it was homophobic, it was racist. It was not the least bit funny. Not even close, complete waste of time. Putting forks in your eyes would be more enjoyable.",Hot Tub Time Machine
259,wallac66,"How can the past change the future, maybe it's a hot tub the can change it.",10,26 July 2012,"Hot Tub Time Machine is a comedy involving three friends, Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson), and Lou (Rob Corddry) who get back together after years of lost communication. Adam, Nick, and Lou are very unhappy with their lives so the take a road trip, along with Adam's nephew, Jacob (Clark Duke), to their favorite party spot, The Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, where they experienced some of the best and worst times in their pasts. After a night of drinking in the hot tub, they appear to have gone back to 1986. They have the chance to change their pasts but also need to make sure that they go back to the present so that Jacob is born. Hot Tub Time Machine reflects on how someone's actions can change their life. Making the right decision and doing what is right for you not just for the present but for the future can help make them both better. The lighting and sound in Hot Tub Time Machine really make the film exciting and upbeat. The film is full of different lighting techniques, they use natural light, such as when they are skiing at the resort. This is a very bright and open scene where all of them are enjoying themselves and feel so young again. They use darker lighting, such as when Nick is performing with his band for the crowd. They focus on him and make the audience have a darker appearance, because that was Nick's passion and talent and that's what he enjoyed. The sound that is used throughout the film really fits the scenes and tone. They use 80's music with an upbeat and fun feel, which is what the movie portrays. The sound when the hot tub repair man shows up for the first time is one that forms an impression and allows for mystery and excitement. When the hot tub is fixed and they pour Chernobyl on the control panel, the hot tub explodes and sends rushing water up in the air twirling around creating a very exciting scene filled with sounds that emphasize these aspects. Together, Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob experience a moment that could change each one of their futures. If they do exactly what happened in 1986, they already know what their future is like, but if they change what happened that night and follow their temptations they can possibly change their future for the better, but they could affect Jacob's existence.",Hot Tub Time Machine
260,igormackowsk,So good,10,14 February 2021,Yeah it makes no sense half the time but that's what it's supposed to do. It's a cult classic. People who don't like this movie just don't injoy life. This movie is just fun and great.,Hot Tub Time Machine
261,javed_rehman-756-907363,It's fun!,10,29 March 2018,"It's fun! It's corny, cheesy, serious, romantic kinda, gives you a slice of what would i do in that scenario, and a great friendship story. So much better than what was expected.",Hot Tub Time Machine
262,sirelf,"If you like to laugh,& you can avoid seeing the trailer,see this movie!",10,13 March 2010,"First off, don't let the trailer scare you, off! Most movies I see the trailer is cut to give you the best possible view on the movie, the two trailers for this movie did the exact opposite! I'm Sci Fi fan, so I when I had a chance to see a free screening of this movie, I almost passed, boy I'm glad I didn't! This movie was great, I agree with with one of the other reviewers, this film had elements that reminded me of Hangover,I will definitely own this movie on bluray! John Cusack was fantastic,he delivered his classic dry wit,Craig Robinson almost steals the movie with his pre-cover of ""Lets get it started"" and Clark Duke as the Gen Y kid hanging with the three old farts( lets be honest losers) was the perfect counter to the three veteran actors(he plays Dale on ABC Familys Greek), the Eightys references were fantastic, and you gotta love the squirrel (reminded me of the gopher from Caddieshack)the only person who wasn't needed in this movie was Chevy Chase, he was in maybe two minutes of the movie, and I didn't think he had one funny line, if you liked Back to the Future,Hangover, or if you like John Cusack go see this movie!",Hot Tub Time Machine
263,grillmaster-21427,Awesome,10,20 January 2019,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie. There's many scenes I have questions about. When they go back and look in the mirror and see their younger selves, did Jacob not see them younger earlier in the day? When Nick played let's get it started, he says to his band before they played it, just like we rehearsed. When did they rehearse?",Hot Tub Time Machine
264,courtneywalters,Very fun,9,23 November 2015,"The film is a tribute to the era of the eighties, possessing great musical references, pop culture, political incorrectness and general visual experience of the decade. The type of humor that runs through here can be called a ""Chatty"" humor. It is based on derogatory language, constant insults between the characters. Currently the most common style of comedies in Hollywood. The cast was great and funny. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" definitely not perfect, but it is entertaining and gives us a good laugh. The film is generally fun and easy to follow, contains a lot of good humor. Worth watching for pure entertainment.",Hot Tub Time Machine
265,pennocko,...seriously?,1,4 April 2010,"I'd like to start out this review by making something very clear; I am not a pretentious movie watcher. There are very few movies that exist that I flat out do not enjoy. Anything ranging from simple comedies such as Anchorman or Cannibal: The Musical to artsy fartsy movies like the Painted Veil or Married Life are fine by me. However, Hot Tub Time Machine is literally the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and I say this having seen all three movies in the Gladiator Cop spectrum.I'll begin with the three things I enjoyed about this movie.John Cusack wore a similar costume to what he did in 16 Candles. - There was a scene that was reminiscent of 16 Candles. - Crispin Glover was in it (also in Back to the Future)It is important to realize here that I am not just showing off my knowledge of films, these were just the only moments where I thought ""Huh, thats pretty clever"" before being lowered back into the festering pit that was this movie.Another thing I want everyone to know is that I went in with medium to high expectations. I like Rob Corddry. I like John Cusack. I like Craig Robinson. And above all, I like movies about time travel.Now to the massacre...This movie is the lowest common denominator of entertainment. It opened with a poop joke. Don't get me wrong, I love poop jokes, but this set the theme for the remainder of the movie.You know how with most mainstream comedies you get the odd joke where you think ""OK, their reaching for some low brow laughter in the theatre, but thats OK because the rest of the movie is pretty funny""? Now the important thing to realize is that Hot Tub Time Machine is that sentence, excluding everything after the comma. It is filled with jokes that should insult the intelligence of everyone on earth. ""Guys, do you get it...he's drunk so he threw up on a squirrel!"" ""He's having sex with that guy's mom in the past!"" ""Jessie's Girl is playing, we all like that song!""Another major problem with this movie is that the time travel aspect is essentially glossed over. I'm not demanding a complete explanation of the space time continuum; even one of Doc Brown's chalkboard explanations would have been more than enough. I firmly believe the writer's wanted to make 80s jokes, but realized they weren't in the 80s, so they just sent their characters back in time. If you've ever had a conversation along the lines of ""wasn't the 80s weird?"" you've seen this film. I can not even begin to stress how much I want you to not see this film. I hated it. Every ounce of my being despised what I was seeing. For the sake of humanity, don't see this movie. Go for a walk, straighten some paper clips, or even just enter stasis for an hour and a half. Any of these are better options.P.S. Why when they were outside (a large portion of the movie) couldn't you see their breath.",Hot Tub Time Machine

267,seapixy,Hot Tub Horrible!!,1,25 July 2010,"I remember when HTTM was in theaters and being hyped constantly on TV. The outtakes in the commercials appeared really funny, and although I missed going to see it, I thought I'd rent it at some point when I needed a good laugh...Well, tonight I rented it and watched at a friend's house and....was completely disappointed. I wish I could get a refund from Blockbuster!This movie is just awful. I kept waiting for HTTM to get better, hit it's stride, get to the hilarious bits, but that never happened. Halfway through my friend and I paused it to get a snack, and I said ""I'm still waiting for this to get funny"" and my friend said ""me too!!"" We agreed that the TV commercials contained all that would ever be marginally funny in this pile of cinema garbage.The premise is ridiculous, but not in a funny way. The 80s are depicted in a flat, 2D way - - the writers totally missed (or were just lazy)-- since they didn't exploit even ONE trend, one overboard thing from that crass, neon, padded shoulder, big hair decade. Instead the decade's portrayal is flat, just a backdrop to a paper thin plot that goes NOWHERE.I can't believe John Cusack or Crispin Glover could be that desperate...are there really not any other better films for them in Hollywood right now? And that this junk was PRODUCED by Cusack tells me he's either cruising on autopilot or on drugs, because I'd really expected more from him.Chevy Chase is unfunny and just there for the paycheck. The rest of the actors also just dial in their performances. This movie could have been so much better, but the off pacing, bad writing, and continuous cursing and drug depictions just ruin it.I'm not a big comedy person, but there are a few that you can see that the writers, producers, actors, really gave 110% to make something truly funny--HTTM is NOT that movie!! It a piece of over-hyped crap.My suggestion: Don't waste your money or time on this pile of poo. Go rent SuperBad, Something About Mary, Spaceballs or some other comedy classic instead.",Hot Tub Time Machine
