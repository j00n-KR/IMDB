0,MartinHafer,"a morally bankrupt ""love story""",2,9 June 2005,"When movies like this gain the popularity that they do, I feel concerned for the moral plight of our world. I'm sure this sounds awfully preachy, but I am serious. When I watched this film, I was totally turned off by the ""romance"" between Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell. Think about it, folks! These two don't know each other at all. They happen to meet at a wedding and screw like weasels in heat! Then, they leave and don't see each other until the next wedding, where they once again screw like weasels. This happens several times and there is no love, no commitment--just pointless sex. I would have REALLY loved it after a while if they would have had the characters get STDs--then at least the movie would have had some point! It's ironic that the same pointless sex is exactly what the real life High Grant got himself involved in with that skanky prostitute only a few years later. Given the message movies like these make, the next ones caught with prostitutes might just be our own children--after all, the message these movies give is ""do what feels good and damn the consequences"".",Four Weddings and a Funeral
1,TheLittleSongbird,Never less than hugely enjoyable,9,12 April 2010,"While starting off a little on the slow side, this film is never less than hugely enjoyable. The tale of the bachelor, his friends and their romantic escapades is constantly charming, witty, poignant and most of all funny, and the humour here is suitably understated. The film further benefits from being superbly written, beautifully filmed and sharply directed with a well structured story that could have easily have been episodic. Also whereas there have been films where I have been indifferent to the characters, the script ensured that the characters were warm and easy to empathise with. I think it is also to do with the quality of the acting, with Hugh Grant at his most charming, Andie MacDowell at her most enigmatic and Simon Callow and Kristen Scott-Thomas especially outstanding among the supporting cast.Overall, Four Weddings and a Funeral is a hugely enjoyable and enduring film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Four Weddings and a Funeral
2,Leofwine_draca,Not my cup of tea,4,10 June 2018,"I admit I'm no lover of romantic comedies, so FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL left me cold; it's the kind of film that I watched and didn't laugh once, although I might have raised a smile here or there. I was tired of Hugh Grant's fussy idiot stereotype after about five minutes of enduring it, while the rest seems to be a mish-mash of romantic cliches and character humour that doesn't quite work. The less said about the grating Andie MacDowell the better.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
3,SnoopyStyle,"Like the rom-com, Love the friends",8,9 January 2014,"Charles (Hugh Grant) and his friends seems to have quite a few weddings to go to. This movie takes place in and around four weddings and a funeral. In the first wedding, he encounters enchanting American Carrie (Andie MacDowell). He falls for her immediately, and he keeps running into her.I think this is the first time I saw Hugh Grant, Kristin Scott Thomas or Rowan Atkinson in anything. It's a very good introduction to all of them. My favorite comedy bits include the ghosts of girlfriends past, 33, and Duckface. Of course, Hugh Grant is doing his stuttering most notably about David Cassidy. Although the rom-com with Grant and MacDowell has its moments, it's the group of friends that make this movie shine. The shiniest has to be Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett. This is one fun and touching comedy.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
4,boblipton,It's The Wrong Time And The Wrong Place,9,19 June 2021,"At a series of weddings, Hugh Grant keeps running into Andie MacDowell and sleeping with her. They clearly love each other, but never actually do anything about it.The romantic comedy is one of the basic genres. If sometimes it seems as if there's nothing new to say on the subject, or there's something creepy about the way the boy and girl torment each other, every once in a while one comes along to say something new on the subject, or at least crack new jokes.Or say the same old thing, but simply and forthrightly. That's the thesis of this movie: love happens, it's real, and it can strike like a thunderbolt.Once you accept that, this movie makes perfect sense. Of course, once you've stated that, what is there to make a movie about? Well, there's always the mis-steps, and Richard Curtis' script turns comedy on its head. As we understand comedy, it's about timing, wit, and physical abuse. Grant exhibits what might be called ""anti-timing"" here: always late, always in the wrong place, unable to express himself, the one fall he takes clumsily faked. Compare that with Miss MacDowell, whose lines express her thoughts simply and elegantly. It's a perfect comedy of embarrassment, and Grant plays it perfectly. Add in Curtis' usual assortment of oddballs and losers, and the little world of this film, where no one ever works and every weekend has another wedding where you'll run across exactly the same same people seems like eternal punishment.What completes the excellence of this movie is the little documentary touches that director Mike Newell throws in. There's one brief shot at the funeral, of an old man opening his mouth to cry out in grief, never uttering a sound, as a heartbroken John Hannah recites Auden's ""Funeral Blues"" that feels very real to me. It's the touches like that which ground a movie, making the gags funnier. It's a rare perfect script, with great casting and beautiful direction. That's all right with me.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
5,mark.waltz,"By the third wedding, I started cleaning up the living room.",7,21 January 2021,"It was all so repetitive, certainly very funny in spots, at least when Hugh Grant was onscreen. There's a reason why throughout the 1990's, he was a top star and quite in demand. But how often can you play the stereotypical awkward young Englishman and keep it fresh? Well, he managed to do it, and here, he is definitely in top form.How then does he get involved with the American Andie MacDowell? She basically reads her lines like she's reading a telephone book, without any emotion, and frankly, her character is rather frightening. When she meets him at the first wedding, she makes insinuations of them having a fling, and then goes out of her way to ensure that it happens, basically insinuating that he's now her man and sounds like she's demanding that they marry.A reference to ""Fatal Attraction"" follows up this scene, and when they meet again, she's flirting with him but then announces that she's engaged to a wealthy Scotsman, the third wedding. she's charming and spots and always seems to be happy, but there's something underneath that where Grant should be very wary of her. That's an element of the writing, not her performance, although she is one of the most boring actresses of the 1990's.So what you don't get from the leading lady you do get with Grant and the wacky people around him, a group of British character actors who range from Rowan Atkinson as a stuttering priest to Simon Callow as an older gay man who has found real love with a much younger man. the funeral is actually more interesting than some of the weddings, because you can only have so many awkward best man speeches without getting redundant.So where does this film stand 25 years after it's successful release? It certainly has some extremely memorable moments, but it really says nothing about the human condition other than the fact that we're all messed up regardless of our gender or relationship status. in a romantic comedy, you have to root for the two leads to get together, and unfortunately, that does not happen here. So enjoy it for the charming leading man and the eccentrics around him, but stay away from the bouquet. After this, I wouldn't want there to be a fifth wedding.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
6,lee_eisenberg,this did NOT deserve an Oscar nod,5,5 October 2013,"While I'd been out of town for a week in 1994, my parents told me that they'd seen ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". The movie eventually got nominated for Best Picture. It didn't win, and Hugh Grant soon gained a reputation as a playboy whose repertoire consisted of eye-rollers like ""Nine Months"".Well, now I've seen the movie, and I can't see what motivated anyone to nominate it for Best Picture in a year that saw ""Ed Wood"" and ""Legends of the Fall"" (""The Shawshank Redemption"" should've won). Yes, I know that this movie is about the development of relationships, but so what? The best character is Rowan Atkinson's bumbling priest. I am NOT impressed. Mike Newell did a far more interesting job with ""Donnie Brasco"" and ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"".What's with all those weird hats that English people wear at weddings?",Four Weddings and a Funeral
7,jboothmillard,Four Weddings and a Funeral,10,11 March 2005,"From BAFTA nominated director Mike Newell, and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Blackadder writer Richard Curtis comes this excellent all-star cast romantic comedy. Basically the story follows Charles (BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Hugh Grant) and his friends, Tom (James Fleet), Gareth (BAFTA nominated Simon Callow), Matthew (BAFTA nominated John Hannah), Fiona (BAFTA winning Kristin Scott Thomas), Scarlett (Worzel Gummidge's BAFTA nominated Charlotte Coleman, and deaf brother David (David Bower) as they repeatedly meet at weddings, and try to find their perfect partners. At wedding one for Angus (Timothy Walker) and Laura (Sara Crowe), Charles is smitten by the attractive American, Carrie (Golden Globe nominated Andie MacDowell), and they sleep together. After wedding two for Bernard (David Haig) and Lydia (Sophie Thompson), performed by inexperienced vicar Father Gerald (Rowan Atkinson), Charles starts to develop stronger feelings and she tells about all her sex exploits, but she is engaged to Hamish (Corin Redgrave). Wedding three is the one that crushes Charles, Carrie and Hamish, and he didn't interfear. It is also there that Gareth dies (heart attack), and soon after everyone is gathered at the funeral, and Gareth's close friend Matthew is tearfully reading a poem to express his feelings. Eventually, the fourth wedding comes along, it is Charles and Henrietta/""Duckface"" (Anna Chancellor), but Charles will be shattered and embarrassed when Carrie shows up and says she has now left Hamish, and he eventually ends the wedding with the 'punch'. There is the happy ending though, not just for Charles and Carrie, but there are also flashes of photographs from following weddings for the other characters. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction for Mike Newell, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Richard Rodney Bennett, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay, it won the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Hugh Grant was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Kristin Scott Thomas was number 22 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, the film was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the funeral, it was number 75 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 36 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest British Films, and it was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",Four Weddings and a Funeral
8,Tweekums,Laughter and tears as Hugh Grant finds love at Four Weddings and a Funeral,9,9 March 2015,"Charles has attended many weddings with his group of unmarried friends; none were his though. Then, at a wedding where he is the best man, he sees Carrie and it is love at first sight. Things seem to go well and he spends the night with her; then she says she must return to the United States. He doesn't expect to see her again but a few months later, while attending another wedding, he meets her again the 'best wedding ever' quickly becomes the worst though when he learns that she is now engaged; that doesn't stop him sleeping with her again though. The next wedding is Carries and this goes well enough; right up until Charles's friend Gareth collapses and dies. After the funeral it is time for another wedding; this time Charles is getting married the question is who is his bride and is he over Carrie?The plot of this film is fairly simple but none the less effective. The four weddings and the funeral of the title provide lots of laughs, some enjoyable romance and more than a few tears. Hugh Grant is great as Charles; it is the sort of role he was made to play and Andie MacDowell is likable as Carrie although we don't really get to know her character as well as we might. The strength of the film is maintained by an excellent supporting cast; Simon Callow does a fine job as the exuberant Gareth and John Hannah is equally good as Gareth's boyfriend Matthew; it is nice to see this gay couple being shown as ordinary people rather than camp clichés. It was also good to see that Charles's deaf brother, David, was portrayed by deaf actor David Bower. The late Charlotte Coleman is utterly delightful as Scarlett. The rest of the cast are pretty good too. Overall this is a great rom com that has stood the test of time; well worth watching or rewatching.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
9,ComedyFan2010,My kind of romantic comedy,9,24 December 2013,"I remember when I first saw the movie I didn't like it, watching it now though I liked it a lot. I guess this is because of age difference. Having attended several wedding and knowing more of relationships I see now things that passed me by years ago.I like it, because it is different. Sure, the plot line is the standard one: a guy and a girl see each other, fall in love at first sight and end up together, we never see their love develop and must just accept that it is the usual love at first sight But details like characters, surroundings etc. is what makes it more unique and makes me look over the first love thing.I liked the characters. Charles and Carrie had their share of relationships/or sex but never had a true commitment. They seem to b the perfect soul mates. Yeah, my last line was very sappy, but it just seems right that this kind of people end up together. And not only that, they decide to ""not to be married forever"". i like this part because not everyone is a ""marriage person"" and these two seem to be the ones who would be happier without it. I was expecting the movie to end with the message of how the happy ending is the wedding, while it shows us that a happy ending is simply to be with someone you love. Andy MacDowell's acting is criticized a lot, but I saw nor problem with it. I guess it depends on what person one expects Carrie to be. But the thing is, she could be any kind. We don't know too much about her. People just seem to put her into a ""slut"" drawer and expect her to be less reserved and more outgoing. I liked that the character went so against usual expectations. She is just a normal woman with a sex life, not a usual ""almost virgin"" you see on TV and the sexists in or society want women to be.I also liked the portrayal of the gay couple. Simply because they are never really presented to us as a couple, we just know that they are. It is great because they made it not extraordinary, but normal as it is supposed to be. I didn't even realize that they were together until the funeral and Matthew's speech. The one part that made me cry. It was a beautiful moment.I also liked the character Fiona who was greatly portrayed by Kristin Scott Thomas. Her love for Charlie is just another thing that happens in life, when someone may love a friend knowing that it will not happen.The great amount of characters is what stops us from knowing them too well. But it is perfect for this movie because it just gives us the usual atmosphere of a wedding. A bunch of people you kind of know because you keep on seeing them at ceremonies, but don't really know because you don't see them outside of it.And the comedy element is great. It is nothing over the top, bu yet hilarious portraying issues that may arise at a wedding. The ring scene is wonderful. So is Rowan Atkinson's first ceremony. And Charlie's constant sleeping over and then running to the wedding yelling ""f..., f... f..."" (""prohibited words""). There is of course more but I don't need to tell the whole movie in the review!",Four Weddings and a Funeral

11,Doylenf,Hugh Grant establishes his persona in excellent British comedy...,7,1 March 2007,"This is one of the funniest, wittiest, cleverest comedy/romances to come out of Great Britain, moving at a quick pace through a series of scenes commemorating FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, with a cast of wonderful British players headed by HUGH GRANT and American actress ANDIE MacDOWELL.The running joke seems to be that Grant never knows what time it is, even though he's scheduled to attend a wedding almost every Saturday of his life. Grant plays the character in his standard befuddled, confused, yet charming manner and handles the role like a real pro.I'm not an admirer of ANDIE MacDOWELL but she's competent enough as his over-sexed sweetheart, the girl he falls in love with ""at first sight"", with marriage eluding both of them because of some bad timing. At last, just when it seems Grant will tie the know with someone else, he comes to his senses (thanks to a hilarious church scene that ends with his would-be bride punching him out of sheer vexation, knocking him flat on the church floor).Delightful performances by the entire cast, with special kudos to JOHN HANNAH, SIMON CALLOW, KRISTIN SCOTT THOMAS and ROWAN ATKINSON in great supporting roles.But it's Grant who keeps the thing buoyant and easy to take despite some of the implausibilities in detailing the relationship he has with MacDowell. Easy to see why the screenplay got an Oscar nomination.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
12,preppy-3,Just OK,6,5 May 2006,Charles (Hugh Grant) keeps attending friends' weddings one after the other. He realizes he's the only one not getting married--because he can't commit. Then he meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at one of the weddings and falls immediately in love...but does she love him and can he overcome his fear of commitment?I remember loving this in 1994--but it doesn't hold up 14 years later. It has its definite good points--two of Charles' friends are a gay couple and are presented very matter of factly with no big fuss; it LOOKS beautiful; the cast is as good as they can be and there are some solid laughs. But it doesn't really work. For starters we know nothing about these characters--heck Charles isn't even given a last name! We don't even find out the name of one of his friends till halfway through the movie. They're just stock characters. Also the movie is too long and slow--it needed tightening up.The acting is as good as it could be. Simon Callow is fun as Gareth and David Bower is drop dead handsome and good but talented actors like Kristen Scott Thomas are left with nothing to work with. Grant does wonders with his under-written role--he's utterly charming and likable. Unfortunately MacDowell doesn't match him but she's incredibly beautiful--Grants obsession with her is understandable.Also this ends with a bunch of happy endings that strain credibility (even for a romantic comedy). But this film was a huge hit and made Grant a star so use your own judgment. Also be aware of the R rating--there's tons of swearing and VERY frank sexual dialogue. Don't let the kids see this one.I can only give it a 6.,Four Weddings and a Funeral
13,writers_reign,Quiet American,5,5 May 2016,"It was - and for all I know still is - often said of Roger Moore that his entire repertoire consisted of raise left eyebrow, raise right eyebrow, which may well be true but it's still twice the sum total of Hugh Grant's repertoire which consists of a shy grin punctuated by a stutter carefully designed to result in ersatz charm. Thank God, therefore, that he is here confronted with genuine charm in the shape of Andie McDowall, the lone American who takes on the cream of British luvvies and leaves them dead in the water. Richard Curtis, who supplied the screenplay attempts to do the reverse by taking on the cream of American screenrights who dabbled in romantic comedy, Ben Hecht, Charles MacArtur, Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, Preston Sturges, Robert Riskin et al or, to put it another way, pits his Edsel against their Dusenbergs. Ouch! Having said that this is a pleasant lightweight diversion but you'd really be better checking 'Midnight', 'Easy Living' (1937 version), 'The Philadelphia Story' etc out of Blockbusters and see how the big boys do it.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
14,lastliberal,My all-time favorite,10,12 March 2007,"There is no movie that I enjoy watching over and over. This is absolutely the best film of Hugh Grant's career. Andie MacDowell is stupendous as his American Love interest. These two belong together like butter and jam on toast.There were so many great performances in this film that it is hard to point out anyone without offending another or going on all day. Rowan Atkinson was simply marvelous as a priest. Auden's poem. read at the funeral, had me in tears. This film was such a celebration of life that even death was remembered fondly.I just cannot imagine that anyone would not find this film as funny as I did.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
15,grantss,"Wonderfully funny, warm and emotional - the perfect romantic-comedy",10,5 June 2016,"We see the lives of a group of friends, largely through scenes at four weddings and a funeral. In this group is Charles who has a unhappy past with relationships. Then he meets an American woman, Carrie, at one of the weddings and it seems like his luck has changed. However, things are not so simple. As with almost everyone in his group of friends, it appears that the Right One is out there but never available.Wonderfully funny, warm and emotional - the perfect romantic-comedy. Written by Richard Curtis, of Blackadder fame, and directed by Mike Newell, this movie works on so many levels. As a comedy it is superb - very funny and intelligently so. Then there's the friends aspect, which creates a great warmth and engagement and a feeling of camaraderie. Characters have depth and complement each other well.Lastly, it works very well as a romantic drama too. Not your usual schmaltzy, formulaic romance but an intelligent examination of the subject.Hugh Grant is great as Charles. The role pretty much locked in his character in future roles - the shy, hesitant, stammering yet charming type. He has played that in about every role since.The group of friends are well cast and give spot-on performances: John Hannah (as Matthew), James Fleet (Tom). Kristen Scott Thomas (Fiona), Simon Callow (Gareth) and Charlotte Coleman (Scarlett). Rowan Atkinson has a minor part but is responsible for possibly the funniest scene in the movie.The only negative thing about the movie is the performance of Andie McDowell (as Carrie). Not terrible, just a flat, aloof delivery and thus quite unengaging. This is made more obvious by the fact that the other characters exude such warmth and vibrancy, making her seem quite cold. She doesn't wreck the movie but it would have been even better with a better actress in that role.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Pretty good British romantic comedy,7,11 August 2006,"From the very beginning, it's clear that this is a different kind of romantic comedy. The characters are more thoroughly developed and the general tone is quite different from what one is used to from this genre. I mainly watched this because I had nothing else planned, it aired on TV, and I enjoy the work of Richard Curtis, who wrote this. I very much like the BlackAdder series and I found his directing effort(which he also wrote), Love Actually to be rather well-done. The plot is fairly good... the idea of having a small group of friends attend several weddings, all the while meeting new people(not to mention old ""friends"") and contemplating where their own love-life(or lack thereof) is headed was a great one, and it works out very well. The pacing is solid, for the very most part. Few(but still some) scenes seem drawn-out. Atkinson's character is basically a one-note joke, but his part is fortunately sufficiently small to not disrupt the flow. The acting is mostly magnificent, with a few exceptions. MacDowell clearly displays the lack of preparation that the top trivia entry alludes to. The humor is quite British, and almost entirely verbal. As such, I, personally, enjoyed the very majority of it. Anyone who isn't familiar with it or simply doesn't find it funny probably won't find much entertainment value in this. With quirky characters and sit-com situations/scenes, this is a somewhat unusual film for its genre. Two fun hours. I recommend this to any fan of British humor and, to a lesser degree, romantic comedies. 7/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral
17,evanston_dad,Can't Remember Much About It Other Than That I Fell Asleep,6,17 March 2009,"I have to admit that I remember very little about this romantic comedy that introduced Hugh Grant to American audiences. A girl on my college dorm floor desperately wanted me to watch it (she was very into all things English), so I obliged, but believe that I fell asleep through part of it. So I guess there you have my review.This took the ""Full Monty"" slot at the 1994 Academy Awards. The little indie comedy from the UK that developed a following and found itself in competition with major Hollywood products (like ""Forrest Gump""). I have a feeling I'd watch it now and find it pretty unremarkable.Grade: B",Four Weddings and a Funeral
18,HotToastyRag,Only for non-jaded women,3,23 July 2019,"While Four Weddings and a Funeral is a staple in '90s romantic comedies, I didn't really like it. It's a little watered-down, like a cross between The Wedding Date and Notting Hill, but if you like that type of ""soccer mom"" humor, you'll probably like it. I just found it too predictable.Hugh Grant, a perpetual bachelor, and Kristin Scott Thomas, an independent woman obviously dependent on a man for her happiness, belong to a group of single friends, Simon Callow, John Hannah, and James Fleet, who watch their other friends get married. As the title suggests, there are quite a bit of weddings in this movie. As most people of the modern generation know, most single people go to weddings with the hope and expectation of enjoying a one-night stand. Hugh Grant meets the beautiful Andie MacDowell at a wedding, and after their one night together, he falls in love with her and can't get her out of his head. Through the rest of the movie, they flit in and out of each other's lives over the course of a few weddings.Four Weddings and a Funeral is the type of movie that can only be enjoyed by women who still have that ridiculous hope that a one-night stand at a wedding can lead to their own trip down the aisle. This movie was specifically made to cater to that group of women, and nearly every scene is nauseatingly pandering. Of course, the single people who meet and connect in the film are very attractive, and of course he can't forget about their connection-even though he's had similar experiences for decades and in real life would continue to pursue similar experiences. Bachelors are bachelors for a reason, and if he suddenly decides to settle down, more often than not it's because he feels his age, doesn't want young girls to laugh and refuse him in the decades to come, and figures since his life is over anyway, he might as well have children and really seal his fate. Too cynical for you? You're probably still in the mindset to enjoy Four Weddings and a Funeral. I'm far too jaded to appreciate the fantasy, especially since I think it's damaging to modern women.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
19,AaronCapenBanner,Descriptive Comedy,4,4 December 2013,"Mike Newell directed this British romantic comedy(and sometimes drama) that stars Hugh Grant as Charles, a British man, who, along with his friends attends four different weddings and one funeral of mutual friends or acquaintances. At the first wedding, he meets free-spirited American Carrie(played by Andie McDowall) and there is some attraction, but it takes the subsequent four further gatherings for the both of them to finally act on it. Overrated comedy was a surprise box office hit at the time, but isn't especially funny or appealing, despite the good cast. Ending is also not in doubt for a minute, though this did make a star of Hugh Grant.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
20,JamesHitchcock,A British Romantic Comedy as Good as Hollywood at its Best,8,15 July 2005,"Richard Curtis's films have sometimes been criticised for giving a too cosy, conservative view of British society. ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" seems to take place in an England of eternal summer, a land which consists almost entirely of green and pleasant countryside and the more exclusive districts of London and which is populated solely by members of the upper and upper-middle classes. The script does cross the border into an equally idealised Scotland of mists, tartans and Highland flings, but even these scenes were actually shot in Surrey. Such criticism contains an element of truth, but is largely irrelevant when it comes to assessing the merits of the film because it ignores the fact that most romantic comedies (in other media as well as in the cinema) are set against a relatively narrow background in terms of social class, often enabling the writer to satirise the manners of that class. Jane Austin, for example, the most successful writer of romantic comedy in nineteenth-century England, set all her works among the wealthy landed gentry or prosperous bourgeoisie of the day.Most of the action of the film takes place either at, or immediately before or after, one of the four church services mentioned in the title. The main character, Charles, is a well-to-do young man, probably educated at public school, and clearly a member of the professional classes, although we never actually discover what his job is. The film starts with a wedding at which Charles is best man to Angus, one of his old friends, and at which he meets Carrie, an attractive young American woman. The film then traces the ups and downs of the relationship of Charles and Carrie, via two more weddings (the second of which is Carrie's own, after she and Charles have split up), the funeral of Gareth, another friend of Charles who suffers a heart attack while dancing at Carrie's wedding, and one final marriage ceremony.Hugh Grant, as Charles, gives a very good performance. Grant has a relatively narrow range as an actor, but he is capable of some excellent work within that range. There are some subtle differences between Charles and William, the character Grant played in ""Notting Hill"", another romantic comedy written by Curtis. William is a shy young man who uses ironic, self-deprecating humour as a cover for his shyness and lack of self-confidence. He is very much in love with Anna, that film's heroine, but is afraid to declare his love because he cannot believe that a beautiful and successful film star would take any interest in the owner of a small bookshop. Charles, by contrast, is less shy than William and enjoys more success with women. His humour is also ironic, but for a different reason. He is afraid of his emotions and of commitment and uses irony as a means of distancing himself from life and of avoiding having to commit himself.The film can be seen as the story of Charles's journey to emotional maturity. He has had a number of brief affairs, all of which have petered out precisely because he is afraid of his emotions. His relationship with Carrie initially goes the same way and she marries a richer and older man. The change in Charles's character is partly due to the fact that he sees his carefree bachelor world disappearing as most of his friends get married, but the event which seems to have the greatest effect on him is Gareth's funeral, at which a moving eulogy is read by Matthew, Gareth's gay partner, touchingly played by John Hannah. Charles realises the strength of the love that Gareth and Matthew shared for one another and comes to appreciate that such a relationship is something to be valued.Grant does well to make Charles a sympathetic figure, despite his having many failings quite apart from his ironic distancing of himself from the world. He is clumsy, accident-prone (he manages to lose the ring at Angus's wedding), much given to profane language and can be appallingly tactless, especially about his former girlfriends. The other main character, Carrie, can perhaps be seen as a female Charles, someone who is on the same journey as him but who has travelled slightly further. (It is significant that her name is short for Caroline, the feminine equivalent of the name Charles). She freely admits to having had over thirty previous lovers, but she is the first to want to bring emotional commitment to their relationship. Am I, incidentally, the only one to have liked Andie MacDowell's performance?- she has come in for a lot of criticism, in my view undeserved, on this board.The film is, however, more than simply a study of relationships- it is also very funny with some superb lines. Hugh Grant can be very amusing, and there was a great cameo from Rowan Atkinson as a bumbling, nervous trainee priest who keeps fluffing his lines during one of the weddings. (""Awful wedded wife"", or ""Holy Goat"" for ""Holy Ghost""). I also liked David Bower as Charles's deaf brother David, the late Charlotte Coleman as his impudent younger sister Scarlett and Anna Chancellor as his ex-girlfriend Henrietta (also known as Duckface), whose embarrassing emotional incontinence perhaps explains why Charles is so keen to distance himself from his feelings. I was less impressed by Simon Callow as Gareth, loud, extrovert and excessively hearty (like most characters Callow plays).To sum up, this was a very good film indeed; proof that the British cinema can produce romantic comedies as good as Hollywood at its best. 8/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Nobody wants to be lonely,6,8 November 2005,"""Four Weddings and A Funeral"" starts off as a really nice comedy but ends poorly in my opinion. I am a little surprised by the decent rating here on IMDb.POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! OK, we start off with Hugh Grants' character, Charlie. He is always late and a bit commitment-phob. He meets Carrie, an American lady with a bad reputation. They have a one night stand and Carrie leaves the next morning for America. Charlie has not stopped thinking about her for over 3 months where they have another encounter at another wedding. Unfortunately, we find out that Carrie is engaged, it's only been 3 months! Crazy, no? Well, does this stop them from having another night together? No! She gets married the next day like nothing happened and Charlie confesses his love to her. When he and his friends make a pact to get married, he goes back to his crazy Fatal Attraction type of neurotic ex. They become engaged out of no where and when Carrie comes to Charlie's wedding, she tells him that she's separated. So, the mature thing to do for Charlie, dump his bride at the alter and Carrie and Charlie live happily ever after.In my opinion, the ending was just ridicules and immoral. I wasn't too crazy about this movie. I enjoyed about 60% of the movie, but the rest was just too heart breaking.6/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral
22,sddavis63,A Good Start That Quickly Disappears,4,7 September 2009,"This movie had a pretty strong start. The first of the four weddings referred to in the title was a very funny affair, and seemed to be setting the stage for a very funny movie populated by a variety of memorable characters. Unfortunately, most of the fun and enjoyable parts of the movie seemed to be packed into that first wedding. From that point on, the movie became increasingly less enjoyable, mirroring the fact that as the movie went on, the two leads (Charles and Carrie, played by Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell) became increasingly less likable.Charles is a guy who is terrified of commitment, not being able to imagine himself getting married. Not surprisingly, then, when he meets Carrie and falls head over heels in love with her, he's decided that he wants to make a commitment to a woman who can't make a commitment to him because she's already engaged to someone else. There's some classic psychological stuff going on there; Charles in some ways is a great case study for relationship counsellors! He bumbles his way through the movie, causing deep pain to at least one woman by both his inability to commit and his inability to admit that he can't commit, all the while pining away for Carrie. She, on the other hand, has essentially the same problem with commitment. In a conversation with Charles she goes one by one through the 33 men she's slept with in her life. He's #32, the most interesting points being that their first tryst came within a few hours of their meeting and just before she returned to the US (a shallow and likely one-night stand in other words) with their unexpected second coming not long after she tells him that she's become engaged to #33 (and had no intention of giving up #33, whom she didn't love, for a guy she supposedly felt some connection with). Neither Carrie nor Charles are likable characters, although Grant and McDowell weren't bad from a performance perspective, Grant I thought being the better of the two.All the way through this, you know that ultimately these two are going to end up together, and equally all the way through this you hope that they don't, because (a) it's just too easy and obvious, and (b) you really don't want these two, who've toyed with and hurt so many others, to find happiness together. Then, in the end, when they do get together, you do find yourself wondering how these two - both with a classic phobia about commitment - can possibly even think about hooking up. The reality is that aside from the first wedding this movie lacks both fun and sympathetic characters. 4/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral
23,StrictlyConfidential,MacDowell Is A Certified Flake,2,28 March 2020,"Well - I can certainly say one thing for sure about actress, Andie MacDowell - She can definitely play a despicable flake with absolute perfection. Yep. She sure can.But - Hey! Wait a minute here!... Come to think of it - I'm actually convinced that the reason why MacDowell was able to portray this sort of contemptible character to a ""T"" was because she was really just playing herself.Anyway - From my perspective - 1994's ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"" was a pretty nauseating Rom-Com whose 2 main characters (Charlie and Carrie) didn't even have the capacity to generate a single iota of chemistry between themselves. No, they didn't.And, with that said - I thought this completely contrived movie was total garbage from start to finish.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
24,ElMaruecan82,"Four occasions to laugh, one to cry, five to meditate about love and life ....",9,25 September 2012,"Many romantic comedies end with the two leads finally reuniting for the final kiss and realizing that they're meant to live together. Though it doesn't necessarily imply that the following step is marriage, but we can bet on a long-term commitment.Basically, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" stands above all the 'romantic comedy' genre because it doesn't take its very essence for granted and turns into a delightful social commentary about the meaning of marital commitment even questioning its compatibility with real love. Can love last for life? If not definite answers, the film provides some hints through four martial experiences and one funeral, which is an occasion to think about life and death. Mike Newell finds the perfect balance between humor, slapstick and intelligence, all of them in a typically British flavor.And one thing for sure, the film's title doesn't lie about the content since the five titular events and their direct aftermaths occupy almost 95% of the screen time. And as viewers, we're (literally) invited to follow the adventures of one joyful bunch of friends. On the top of them, there's Hugh Grant as Charles, a handsome thirty something bachelor whose penetrating blue eyes betray a vulnerable sensitivity that doesn't fit his look. There is the tiny, exuberant Charlotte Coleman as Scarlett, a gay couple, Matthew (John Hannah) and Garrett played by the scene-stealing Simon Callow. Kristin Scott Thomas plays Fiona, hiding in a sophisticated composure the grief of never having conquered Charles' heart, and last but not least, there's Tom, Jack Fleet as the goofiest and clumsiest of the bunch, which is saying a lot.We never know exactly what these people do for a living, but it doesn't matter actually. Besides, we know them enough to understand the way they feel, behave or approach life and important matters, so the rest would only fill the script with unnecessary details. Have you noticed by the way that in most rom-coms, the jobs of the two lead hardly play a role, one is an architect, and another is a cook, so what? And have you also noticed that many romantic comedies only rely on the believability of its lead couple and some supporting characters, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is an ensemble cast movie, and even more effective because it doesn't depend on a multi-linear plot, the solidarity, the complicity between the friends is the story's heart and greatest source for gags and amusement.I insist on the ensemble cast because truth is if Hugh Grant was perfect for the role that put him in America's showbiz map, and earned him a Golden Globe, the same can hardly be said about Andie McDowell. As much as I respect and appreciate the actress, it's hard to see the same sweetheart who turned Phil Connor's heart in ""Groundhog Day"". She doesn't deliver a bad performance per se, but a Razzie nomination (that thankfully the film was spared of) wouldn't have surprised me. It was hard to believe that Charles would be so infatuated in a woman who doesn't seem quite sure either about love, let alone marriage. Some would think this is what united them since they would be involved in the two weddings that didn't end. But something in Carrie suggested that she was more of a gold-digger type, while Charles is more a victim of his own idealism.Unsuccessful marriages end up being more insightful than the others, (if only because they do 'end up') and one of the merit of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is to put the notion of commitment into perspective, to revalue the meaning of living and loving someone for life. In a way, the subtext is that we are never 100% sure to love someone then marriage is not necessarily a guarantee of happiness OR if we really love one person, then marriage would be totally meaningless. That's the idea conveyed by Gareth and Matthew's who'd be shown as the most solid and sincere couple, without any ceremony to 'validate' their union. The death of Gareth invites for these questions and works as a great dramatic relief in a relatively screwball comedy, thanks to Matthew's powerful eulogy, simple but realistically heart-breaking.But I guess I was a bit too serious in my review, and beyond the whole introspective facade, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is also a cheerful celebration of the most special day of anyone's life, the day we have to say 'yes', this magical moment that sets a before and an after in our lives, that starts with solemnity and ends up with fun, alcohol, and maybe a few years later, regrets. It also allows other people to meet their match, soul-mates or one-night hits. Weddings are the premise of countless jokes, a nice twist on the forget-the-rings gag, embarrassing best man's speeches, some acts of pure desperation and a wonderfully comic moment with Rowan Atkinson as a priest in his first wedding. His five minutes are funnier than the whole 'Mr. Bean' film, in fact, the film reminds us that the world needs marriage, if only to have a great moment of fun and joy.""Four Weddings and one Funeral"" was one of the biggest hits of the glorious 1994, earning two nominations for Best Screenplay and Best Picture. The material is so fresh and new on the field of romantic comedies that it's hard to tolerate such conventional moments like a declaration of love under the rain, and a cheesy line delivered by you-know-who, and it's only forgivable because the film immediately redeems itself through the great ending credits sequence and Elton John's version of ""Chapel of Love"", the credits sequences perfectly captures the positive, optimistic mood of the film, and even its not-to-be-taken-so-seriously quality.And it does fit the general message of the film that after all, maybe wedding, just like life, is not to be taken so seriously, and maybe that's the best way to make it work.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Is it still raining?,6,23 April 2020,"'Four Weddings And A Funeral (1994)' is essentially a 'will they, won't they' rom-com in which the mutually attracted Grant and MacDowell continue to meet at the most inopportune of moments. Aside from the decision to set (almost) all the narrative at a series of social gatherings (primarily weddings), the thing is rather generic. Having said that, it clearly establishes a lot of the tropes associated with the genre. Grant's bumbling bachelor is typically an engaging protagonist, even if his inability to acutely convey his emotions does lead him to lead on almost every woman in his life, and MacDowell is better than most people give her credit for, though her delivery of perhaps the picture's most infamous line - ""is it still raining? I hadn't noticed"" - is decidedly unflattering. The rest of the cast are good in their roles but their characters aren't exactly the most rounded. The movie isn't the most compelling or, even, entertaining, but it does the job. Ultimately, it's a decent time with some charming moments and some fairly affecting ones, too. 6/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral

May we all in our dotage be proud to say, 'I was adored once too.'""Ah, I have a soft spot for this one. I just love the ensemble and their performances - Hugh Grant is so awkward and endearing, Andie MacDowell is wonderfully liberated (33 partners and the film doesn't judge her for it), John Hannah ranges from humor to reading that W. H. Auden poem, Simon Callow and Charlotte Coleman are so full of life and joy, and Kristin Scott Thomas displays her emotions with such subtlety. I could go on and on too, the cast is so deep and even in scenes with crowds, watch the acting, it's marvelous. In addition to the gay couple, the inclusion of a deaf character (David Bower) who is a real person like everyone else was a nice touch. There are many wonderfully British bits of humor sprinkled into the script, and the film is charming in how it shows the rituals of life and the silly things we find ourselves doing. It's a rom-com so it has the familiar tropes of the genre, but the framework was creative, many characters are allowed to shine, and I liked the pathos in the film - both with the titular funeral, and the sad aspects of how the romance plays out. For the genre, this is a real standout, and always makes me smile.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
27,g-bodyl,Good For What It Is!,7,23 July 2013,"Four Weddings and a Funeral is a British romantic comedy that is sometimes charming, but it mostly falls flat and gets lost in the mix of all romantic comedies out there. This film is entertaining, but forgettable. Writing this review, I can hardly remember what happens in the movie.Mike Newell's film is about a bachelor named Charles and he is seemingly the best man at many weddings. At the first wedding, he meets this girl and he thinks he finally falls in love. Over the course of several more weddings and a funeral, he gets the notion that maybe he has fallen for the wrong lady.The acting is pretty good for the most part. Hugh Grant is a charming British fellow and this film introduced him to the American audience. Simon Callow and John Hannah are really good and quite funny. Andie McDowell is pretty darn awful and she sounds like she's a robot.Overall, this is a decent but entirely forgettable British comedy. It has some good moments and some boring moments. Some of the jokes are quite funny especially the one involving the band, U2. Despite this being a solid film, I can't fathom how the film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.

29,inkblot11,Could be considered the definitive romantic comedy of all time!,10,9 April 2007,"Charles (Hugh Grant) is set to be best man at the wedding of a close friend, Angus. He gets up very late on the day of the nuptials and nearly misses the wedding. Thank goodness he didn't, for he meets a very attractive lady named Carrie (Andie McDowell) and ends up spending the night with her at a hotel. Although she teases him the next morning about becoming engaged, she leaves quickly and without giving him any contact information. Fortunately, another twosome met at the same wedding and have their own ceremony a few weeks later. There, Charles again meets Carrie and he is thrilled. That is, until he learns she is engaged to a major pain-in-the-butt named Hamish. Horrors! After a lifetime of never meeting the right person, Charles is now smitten but his love interest is committed to another. Nevertheless, Charles and Carrie have a repeat close encounter when Hamish leaves the wedding early. What can Charles do? Meanwhile, Charles's deaf brother David may be falling in love, friend Fiona may be in love with Charles himself, friend Scarlett has fallen for a Texas cowboy, and other friends and foes are dancing at other weddings. How will Charles and his pals fare in the game of love? This is a delightful film. At first glance, it is another romantic comedy. And, it delivers mightily in that respect, having several lovely and funny love stories woven into its fabric. But, it also has much more to say about friendship and about the various ways in which we show love to our fellow man or woman. Hugh Grant is outstanding in his role as Charles, a man with connections who nevertheless glides through life aimlessly until he meets Carrie. McDowell is also beautiful, humorous and touching in her role as a woman who has no trouble attracting suitors but who makes bad choices, at times. The rest of the cast, including Kristin Scott Thomas and Simon Callow, is likewise wonderful. The costumes, settings, and cinematography values are all on the upper rung of moviedom's ladder of production. In addition, the script, direction, and soundtrack are to die for. If you have never seen this film, just where have you been, on Pluto?

30,The-Sarkologist,"Funny, but not one of my favourites",7,12 February 2012,"I had heard some morally bad things about this movie and a number of people portrayed it in a bad light. I think is was because of the prostitute incident at the time of this movie that put me off it. In fact, the prostitute incident put a number of people I knew off of Hugh Grant. Personally I don't think that it was the media's business about whether Hugh Grant was caught with a prostitute, and more so the pressure put on his girlfriend at the time to forgive him.This movie is about four weddings and a funeral. In fact, there is only one scene in the movie that is not set at a wedding or the funeral. As one can tell by the title the movie is about marriage, but the conclusion that it comes to I inevitably disagree with. The movie is based around a group of friends who are always going to weddings. In fact, it is the time of life when everybody is getting married. Charles (Hugh Grant) always sleeps in and as such is always late to weddings. That is until his own when all of his friends make damn sure that he gets up in time.The movie explores death and marriage, and at one point - the low point - the conclusion is that not everybody is going to get married. This is true as Charles concludes, after he called a wedding off because he did not really want to marry Duck Face - Henrietta, that marriage was not for him - yet he still wanted the companionship of a girl. My opinion here is not that marriage was not for him, but rather that he is so scared to make a commitment to a woman that he would rather have a relationship that he can call off easily.The funeral is of a very cheerful chap who dies at the third wedding. This chap is the oldest and commands his friends to find a partner. He dies and they come to see that not everybody is going to get married. This is not true to the movie because, as one can expect, everybody ends up happily ever after.The thing the people I know did not appreciate about this movie was the ending where they say that they can have a perfect marriage relationship without getting married. This I do not really agree with because marriage involves commitments and promises, and if you are not willing to make these promises to the person, then you should not either consider marrying this person, or living with the person as if you were married.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

The ""love story"" was in my opinion more a story of lust, as there was simply no romance.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
33,sol-,My extended review of the film,4,8 January 2005,"In early 1995, Four Weddings and a Funeral became the first film in over 20 years to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture with only one other nomination (Best Original Screenplay). It had no chance of winning the award, but it was a film popular with the general public, especially those from British extraction. The film was so popular in its home country that it won the BAFTA awards for Best Film and Best Director. Looking back almost ten years later, I am forced to wonder why the film was so well received.The film stars Hugh Grant as Charles, a man who cannot commit to a relationship. He has had a string of girlfriends but nothing has ever worked out for him. But at the wedding of a friend, he sees a woman who he lusts after. He asks his friend about her, and he tells Charles that she is a slut, and that he should not go after her. This woman is an American called Carrie (played by Andie MacDowell) and she acts like a seductress and slut through the whole film. The film works around Charles being attracted to Carrie, and his interactions with her at various weddings.Hugh Grant is perfect in the insecure but charming stereotype he has echoed in most of his films; Kristen Scott-Thomas is fairly good, but not great, in a BAFTA award-winning role as Grant's friend, Fiona; and the film itself has a small number of amusing moments, but the film often does not work.For one thing, many of the jokes are not funny. There were a few funny moments and sketches here and there, but much of the humour did not work, at least for me, and I felt that the onslaught of jokes at the first three weddings did not mesh well together. I have been told that much of the humour came from how British people perceive Americans. Being Australian I can't really disagree. All I can say is that it would have better if the jokes tried to cater for an international audience. But then, I guess one has to ask if Newell intended his film to be the international success that it became.Still, there is the problem of characterisation. All of the characters are shallow, except for perhaps Hugh Grant's. As the title suggests, one of the characters dies during the film. This character is one that been on-screen for a fair amount of time, so I supposed I am meant to feel grief for his or her departure. However, I felt no emotional charge. The supporting characters in the film all have no depth, so why should we care for them? Then the last main problem is the whole Carrie character. She is as annoying as hell. Why? Because she's slut, she's deceptive and she's manipulative. She does not appear to be a nice person at all. With a comedy, you don't really want to displease the audience. And what else are we meant to feel but displeasure when Grant is obsessing over her. He has, and has had, a number of chances to make it with a character that is not made out to be annoying in the viewer's eyes, so his obsession with Carrie violates what I, as a viewer, want from the film. In a drama it is sometimes okay to go against what the viewer wants. But comedy is different. In a comedy you don't generally want the viewer to walk out unhappy. And that's what this film did to me.Oddly enough I don't really feel any strong hatred towards the film even though it violated what I would want from a film, even though it was often not funny and even though the characters were never more than surface deep. I guess I found it amusing to a degree, and it did keep me watching, even if not liking it overall. Hugh Grant, Scott-Thomas and a few funny moments are vital in bringing a bad film up to scratch. But they are not enough to make it really worth the watch.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Unorthodox approach to romance a pleasure, but a bit schizophrenic",6,22 November 2010,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" had some pretty amazing competition for Best Picture at the 1995 Academy Awards: Robert Redford's ""Quiz Show,"" Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and the winner, ""Forrest Gump."" To say the least, this little British comedy was way out of its league. As unorthodox and interesting of a romantic comedy as ""Four Weddings"" can be, the comparison stops there next to those all-time greats. But that's not to diminish the British talents that emerged with this film: director Mike Newell, star Hugh Grant and screenwriter Richard Curtis, all of whom are held in high esteem today. Together, they put together a non-traditional, droll comedy with a unique approach that muses about love, life and marriage.The events of the film are indeed as described in the title. A group of friends with non- traditional and/or non-existent love lives attend various weddings of their other friends (and a funeral of course). The focus is Charles (Grant), a bit of a clumsy fellow trying to sort out his feelings on marriage having burned several past lovers as he could never commit. At the very first wedding of the film, Charles meets Carrie (MacDowell), an attractive, flirty and slightly domineering American who hooks him in. After a one-night stand, they find each other three months later at the next wedding, only it turns out Carrie is engaged.Curtis, creator of Rowan Atkinson's (who has a hysterical cameo) character ""Bean,"" makes the better moments of this film with his Oscar-nominated screenplay. You can never completely get a pulse on the humor: one minute he's dry and the next more slapstick, but it works. The romantic subplots -- of which there are many -- could have used some work, but ""Four Weddings"" never feels typical. Curtis' construction of the story, though odd, keeps the film running at an amusing tempo. With the exception of Charles, no character receives a complete portrait, but each receives a strong attribute or context with which the actors can work. Fiona (Kristen Scott Thomas) is a victim of unrequited love that tempers the wedding experience for her and Gareth (Simon Callow) has a joyful ""everything's a laugh"" mentality at weddings. We never see into who these characters really are, Curtis provides enough detail for them to feel real and to enhance the running dialogue about love that makes up the meat of the film. Ever since this film, Curtis (""Love, Actually"" and ""Bridget Jones' Diary"") has specialized in the multi-character romance because he's adept at character design.The fact that ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" tries to play in both dramatic romance and comedic romance prevents it from ever finding footing. Newell excels at directing both, but both don't exist in harmony in this case. The dramatic moments in particular hurt from lack of character depth and the comedic moments -- there aren't enough. The film is memorable, but the identity crisis keeps it out of the conversation of great romances.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Four Weddings and a Funeral

40,FilmCriticLalitRao,Mike Newell has directed a pleasant film about the importance of love.,10,23 May 2013,"Through his comedy film, ""Four weddings and a funeral"", British director Mike Newell gives an excellent idea about how love and marriage are viewed by English people. His film is a quest for finding true love. It also depicts the importance of love over sex in relationships involving men and women. A good film which can be watched with family involves elements which are valued by family members. From that yardstick, a film about love and marriage can be a little offensive only if has some explicit hints about sex. However, English film four weddings and a funeral deliberately avoids any unnecessary mention of sex in order to portray itself as a clean film. The choice of an American actress who is wooed by a flippant British bachelor works well for this film as Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant remain true to their on screen portrayals. In most films, minor characters are not developed but this film gives equal importance to minor characters who help viewers to understand the importance of friends in a person's life. Lastly, four weddings and a funeral is able to impress viewers as its spreads the message that there comes a time in each person's life when he/she has to become serious about marriage and must get married before it is too late.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

The plot is obvious and speaks for itself, it does lead to a few interesting shenanigans. Some of the dialogue is iffy, as is some of the editing though.None of the cast behind Grant stood out to me, with the exception of Rowan Atkinson; but that's only down to how well known he is in general, as here he is underused. I found Andie MacDowell's performance very wooden. I appreciate them not going the obvious route with Kristin Scott Thomas' character, even if it makes her Fiona redundant throughout.Just about serviceable, worth watching if only once.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

Hugh Grant is fine as the reluctant bachelor who attends many of his friends and relatives weddings without ever having his own and not really expecting it, in fact. He falls for an American at the first wedding he attends, played horribly by Andie Macdowell, and hopes this might be more than just a one night fling, but at the second wedding she comes with her fiancée. Of course, that doesn't stop them from having a second encounter. What happens to them after this you'll have to watch for yourself(I don't want to give away everything). The movie is promising at first as a comedy with some laugh-out loud funny scenes during the first wedding, but by the time the 2nd wedding comes it slowly turns into a romantic melodrama that I couldn't wait to be over because I could guess what would happen every step of the way. Too sad because it could have been a very good British comedy but ended up being a mediocre romantic drama at best.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
45,rooprect,"Hated it when I saw it in '94, loved it last night",7,21 February 2012,"When I saw this film in '94, I was expecting something a little snappier & edgier like the rom-coms of the time (such as ""Singles"" or ""When Harry Met Sally""). Instead, its low-key, subtle, British presentation caught me off guard and left me a little bit unfulfilled.I now realize that's because I was an idiot at the time. Subtlety is this film's strength, and Hugh Grant's performance is impeccable in that regard. There aren't a lot of wisecracking zingers or situational craziness, but Hugh's portrayal of a cute, clueless, British playboy is something he does par excellence. Andie McDowell's portrayal of a disconnected, almost soulless enigma is equally compelling, although on first viewing I didn't understand the character.The comedy comes through Hugh's strained reactions to the insane situations he finds himself in. Things happen that would reduce a normal human to hysterics, but Hugh is forced to ride it out with proper British decorum. For example, there's one scene where finds himself stuck at a table with EVERY ONE of his ex-girlfriends, trying to play it off as politely as possible while they take turns freaking out at him.Something to note: Unlike films like ""Harry Met Sally"" and ""Singles"" which focus equally on the characters, this movie is essentially from Hugh's viewpoint, and Andie's character is almost peripheral. With that in mind, it's not a standard love story between two people. Instead it's about one man stumbling through the concept of romance.If you like rom-coms that take a different approach, this is a good one for you to check out. I also recommend ""Forget Paris"" (about what happens to a couple AFTER 'happily ever after') and ""Object of Beauty"" (starring Andie McDowell & John Malkovich as a pair of dysfunctional, small-time con artists in love).If you're a Hugh Grant fan, you'll love this film, period.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
46,gcd70,Amusing British Fare,6,4 January 2008,"The British certainly have a wonderful, subdued sense of humour, as shown in this latest offering from the mother country.Director Mike Newell provides us with a very funny look at the age old institution of marriage, suggesting that perhaps it's not all some would claim it to be. The dashing, and very English, Hugh Grant plays Charles, a rather disillusioned chappie who has seen many of his friends happily tie the knot, yet can't seem to find the right girl himself. Enter American Carrie (Andie McDowell), whom Charles falls head over heels for, but still can't determine to settle down with.""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is mostly a light look at relationships and commitment which even manages to touch on mortality. Mike Newell does attempt to offer us more than just a comedy but really that's all the film is. ""Four Weddings"" never really works as a romance, and fails dramatically as well. Don't let these lesser aspects deter you however, as the comedy alone is worth your while.Never quite justifies the rave reviews it has received, however ""Four Weddings"" will certainly amuse anyone who has ever been involved in a wedding ceremony at any level.

47,aharmas,A Romantic Gem,10,11 April 2006,"Many people have asked why I see movies at least twice (once at the theatre and on DVD). My answer is that there is at least something in most movies that demands such action be taken. Here is an example of a movie that has never lost its luster for me. From the first time I saw it, I recognized its potential, the beauty of its craftsmanship, and its many virtues. There were so many thoughts and emotions going through me, as I laughed along with an involved audience at its clever, romantic, insightful, and moving screenplay. There was a movie that wasn't afraid to share its emotions with the audience in a way that ""Annie Hall"" didn't. It had a brain, a heart, and so much more.Part of the reason the movie succeeds so well is its incredibly talented cast: Atkinson (in a short and hilarious role), McDowell who has never looked more charming, Hugh Grant, a funny lead who carried the film in a way Cary Grant would have been proud of. The very lovely and ethereal Kristen Thomas made also quite an impression. Mike Newell's direction and Richard Curtis' collaboration/screenplay imbues everything and everybody with a magic and delicate touch that remains constant and very effective throughout the entire project.As most people know by now, the film follows the romantic adventures and mishaps of a bachelor who finally finds the woman of his dreams; only to discover she might be beyond his reach. They continue to see each other through a few weddings and ultimately realize they might just be perfect for each other. What makes their relationship a joy to watch is how well defined their characters are. They are real people with flaws, hopes, broken hearts, mistrust, envy, illusions, and dreams. The film entertains and yet it never takes the easy way out to solve their dilemmas. There are bits when one wonders why one is not repelled by some of their actions, then the audience realizes that they are reflections of themselves.There is much to commando in the film, from its romantic score, the gorgeous photography, the superb acting, and most importantly, the assured hand by Mike Newell who adds another gold star to his repertoire. The film is a classic for the ages.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
48,adamjohns-42575,"""Is it still raining, I hadn't noticed.""",9,30 June 2020,"This film is probably the epitome of a typically British wedding, at least in 1993 for the middle classes. I love it. It has all the characters you need and would expect to be found at any wedding and the best of these are Gareth and Matthew. Simon Callow is always a larger than life person and his portrayal of Gareth in this film is the reason I adore him as an actor so much. And who can forget John Hannah's speech at the funeral, which I'm sure has been used many times since, at many more real funerals. What a great choice by Richard Curtis to use it in this film.
The film and story has a great charm and witty one liners. We've all been to weddings like these and it's easy to associate and be familiar with the environments of each one and the God awful choices some Brides and Grooms make with no style whatsoever.
Full of laughs, love and good feeling.
The only thing that really lets it down for me is Andie Macdowell.I was saddened to see that Charlotte Coleman, who played Scarlett, had passed on in 2001 at just 33.

49,dierregi,One-trick pony Grant in the cornerstone of his career,1,29 July 2020,"This movie falls into the same category of ""Pretty Woman"": a silly romantic comedy that blew the world away for reasons difficult to understand. Even if I am a ""chick"", therefore the target audience for this tripe.Grant is Charles, an upper class (toff) guy with a bunch of single friends, who attends regularly his friends weddings, without getting any closer to the altar himself.He had a string of failed relationships and during the second wedding we learn what a cad he is. He meets and falls in lust with Carrie (MacDowell) during the first wedding and through a series of contrivances, even if the two are strongly attracted, they never manage to get together.My two main objections to the plot are:the ""obstacles"" in Charles and Carrie relation are so flimsy as to prove mailny that neither is really interested in pursuing their liaisonthere is zero chemistry between the two leads and even if there was, it would be at most a physical attraction, since they know next to nothing about the otherMost insufferable is the Charles character, who unfortunately started a string of identical roles for Grant, but Carrie is also a paper-thin character, those only feature I remembered after years from seeing the film was her ""loose morals"" so to speak, since she has no problem cuckolding her fiance and telling details about all her previous sexual encounters.Overlong, not funny, clumsy and definitely not romantic.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
50,Spleen,A note to the anti-Andie brigade,9,12 November 1999,"I'm blind to the alleged charm of Andie MacDowell myself.  That's why I think that casting her in this film was a stroke of genius, for so far as my senses tell me she perfectly fits the character she plays: a dull beauty who casts a spell over one out of every twenty men she meets, leaving the remaining nineteen cold and completely baffled.  Charlie (Hugh Grant) is surrounded by MUCH more desirable female friends - even Duckface has something going for her - but instead of so much as noticing them he falls head over heels for an unattainable woman who is, on top of everything else, boring.  Would have been as good as it is if Charlie's passion had made SENSE?  Of course not.Anyway, everyone I know with a low opinion of this film begins the case for the prosecution with an attack on Andie MacDowell.  Is there anything else to dislike?  I can't see it myself.  This is one of the world's few perfect comedies, devoid of longeurs - perhaps the funeral didn't have quite the desired effect - with true comedy and a nice selection of characters.  One has no difficulty keeping the dozen or so members of the main set mentally separate.  How many romantic comedies can you say THAT about?",Four Weddings and a Funeral
51,philip_vanderveken,A classic in its genre that should be seen by all,8,27 February 2005,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is seen as the first of many romantic comedies and personally I have to say that this is still one of the best. While many other movies in this genre always use the magic formula of 'boy meets girl, boy and girl hate each other, something stupid happens, they start to like each other and fall in love...', this movie has been built up much better and smarter.In ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" we follow Charles (Hugh Grant) and his friends. Most of them find a partner and get married, but Charles is still single. But than he meets Carrie during one of these weddings and immediately he falls in love with her. The only problem is that she is an American and that she will fly back to the USA after the wedding. Later he sees her again, only to find out that she is about to marry an older, but very rich man. His world collapses and he decides to give her up and to find someone else. But his love for her is deeper than he thought and he just can't forget about her...I guess this would be an excellent movie for everybody who could use some laughter in his or her life. And it has to be said: the refined, very British humor is certainly a relief after having seen too many examples of the average Hollywood comedy, full of toilet humor (vomitting, farting, ... aren't exactly my idea of humor). The story is very nice and most of the acting is very good, but especially Rowan Atkinson, as the clumsy priest, is absolutely hilarious. The other actors all did a very good job as well, except for Andie MacDowell, who never really seems to get into her role. In my opinion she was the weakest link in this movie.In the end this is still one of the finest romantic comedies I've ever seen and personally I think this movie should be seen by everybody, since it is a classic in its genre.

For some strange reason i simply never got around to watching it until many years after all the hype, but the comments did stick in my mind.So here's what i thought - Positives first 1/ It's really well written by Richard Curts, as you would expect after his fantastic work on the Blackadder series.2/ Hugh Grant performs fantastically well in this role which really launched his career to a new level entirely.3/ It's littered with quirky and humorous characters, who all have minor roles, but provide a great deal of entertainment, Rowan Atkinson and Kirstin Scott-Thomas are the names that stand out the most.4/ It's original and entertaining, with many amusing moments.Now the Negatives, well Negative 1/ Andie MacDowell is seriously bland and terribly miscast in the role of Hugh Grant's often absent love interest, so much so she took the shine off the romantic element in this romantic comedy.In summary 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is good entertainment, that for me failed to live up to all the hype. Probably because it was the first good comedy to come out of Britain for years, but since then we have seen Notting Hill and Love Actually come from the same writer and i found them both more enjoyable than this.Still worth 7/10 despite MacDowell's poor character portrayal.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

I missed this the first (or second or third) time around and it just came on my radar screen a few years back. I was never really a big fan of any of the leads, I guess Andie McDowell was closest from Groundhog Day. But I really like Hugh Grant as the introspective victim (or so he feels) of several misfired romances who always has trouble making weddings on time. Andie is the first girl who causes lightning, but is it just him or does she feel it too? The ensemble work by Hugh's friends is top notch, particularly Callow as the true life of the party, but the whole crew works great together. This has a realistic feel to it and I highly recommend it.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
55,Philby-3,Has lasted better than a lot of marriages,9,7 January 2008,"I happened to catch this movie on TV the night before my nephew's wedding, so it was good preparation for the event to come, even though it took place in a national park rather than in one of Wren's lovely London churches. I very much enjoyed it on its first release in 1994 and it stands up very well 13 years later. It's a strange thing really. The characters are a bunch of aging but immature unemployed hooray Henrys and Henriettas, thrown together originally in boarding school or at universities, now in their early thirties, still aimlessly partying their way through life. Charles (Hugh Grant) is terminally indecisive and the object of his desire, Carrie (an American), though beautiful, is lacking in self-confidence. I couldn't help thinking that the strong-minded Henrietta alias Duckface (Anna Chancellor) would have been a better mate for the feckless Charles, assuming he didn't mind being dominated.So why is this such a great comedy? First, Mike Newell, a very versatile director, has put it together beautifully and there is not a wasted moment. Second the dialogue is sparklingly fresh. Even 13 years later Charles's ""wake-up"" scene at the beginning still packs a punch. The scene at which Charles is trapped at a table with a posse of his ex-girlfriends is just hilarious. Third, although the characters are rather a shallow bunch they are still a good-hearted lot, and when one of them dies the mood changes dramatically. We wind up wishing them well, and the end of the film gives us their eventual matrimonial destinations. The minor characters are all well-drawn also.Richard Curtis, who was responsible for the script, is well-known for ""Blackadder"" (and Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance in this film), but the humour here is of a different sort. We recognise enough of ourselves in this bunch of upper-class twits to laugh along with them, as well as at them.I have only one niggle (shared with a lot of critics) and it is about Andie McDowell's performance as Carrie. It does appear wooden, in comparison with the others. If she is meant to be a pretty woman with no self-confidence, she does the job, sort of. Perhaps the problem is, surrounded by so many good professionals, she's just a pretty face. As we know, Hugh Grant didn't do too well in California.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
56,jhclues,Rich In Story and Characters,9,29 December 2001,"The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, `Four Weddings and a Funeral,' directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar.  Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next.  Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he's had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp.  Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him.  It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it's only-- as they say-- the beginning.	Set in contemporary England, one of the aspects of this film that makes it so engaging is the propriety with which the humor is presented. Refreshingly subtle, there's more of Noel Coward than Tom Green or Rob Schneider to it; a matter of manners, mores and innuendo taking precedence over gross-out, in-your-face, shock schlock humor.  And though Grant and MacDowell are at the forefront of the piece, Newell does an excellent job of developing all of the characters, succinctly supplying enough detail to each individual to give the film some depth and dimension, without having to actually go too deep.  He never lets you forget that first and foremost, this is a comedy.  There's some insight provided, but this is not an in-depth commentary on human nature, though there are some overtones and implications in that direction (Charles is always late to the weddings, for example; perhaps a subconscious denial of the impending nuptials?).  Most importantly, the characterizations are rich, and the story is involving and presented with an even flow that allows you to effortlessly be swept away with it.  	Certain actors make a career out of playing a variation of the same character in film after film, striving for that definitive portrayal.  W.C. Fields played the hen-pecked husband in a number of films, finally perfecting that particular character in the person of Harold Bissonette in `It's A Gift.'  For Hugh Grant, it's the retiring, somewhat self-conscious and stammering, eyelid fluttering charmer, of which he's done a variation in such films as `Sense and Sensibility,' `The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, But Came Down A Mountain,' Notting Hill' and `Mickey Blue Eyes.'  But Charles is his definitive portrayal of that character, the one in which he achieves the balance and honesty that makes the character so believable. It's a good bit of work by Grant, and definitely one of his most memorable performances.	Andie MacDowell, meanwhile, gives a rather composed performance as Carrie, the quiet American with a reserved bluntness who captivates Charles. MacDowell brings a sense of quietude to the role that is sensuously seductive, which lends credibility to Charles' infatuation with her.  It's a role for which MacDowell is perfectly suited, as it allows her to play effectively to her naturally calm demeanor and exquisite beauty and femininity.	In a part that has to be an actor's dream, Simon Callow is absolutely exuberant as Gareth, one of the fixtures of Charles' circle of friends. More than just an effervescent character, Gareth is something of the conscience of the film, laughing away and laying bare any and all pretense or hypocrisy like a modern day flesh-and-blood Spirit of Christmas Present. It's a character that gives needed balance and perspective to the film, and he's wonderfully played by Callow.	Also turning in especially noteworthy performances are John Hannah as Matthew; Kristin Scott Thomas, who is quite alluring as Fiona; James Fleet as Tom, a character very reminiscent of his Hugo in the TV series `The Vicar of Dibley,' (and very effective here); Charlotte Coleman, memorable in the role of Scarlett; and Rowan Atkinson as the hapless Father Gerald.	Rounding out the supporting cast are David Bower (David), Timothy Walker (Angus), Sara Crowe (Laura), Anna Chancellor (Henrietta), Simon Kunz (John), David Haig (Bernard), Sophie Thompson (Lydia Jane) and Corin Redgrave (Hamish).  There's enough twists and turns along the way to keep this film unpredictable, including one scene near the end that initially seems so mean-spirited that it may have you biting your fist and crying, `Oh, NO!' But, not to worry, Newell provides an instant resolution consistent with the rest of the film, and it not only works but gets a good laugh to boot. Entertaining, pleasant and funny, `Four Weddings and a Funeral' makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today. It's what's known as the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
57,dglink,"Quirky Characters Shine in Touching, Funny, Romantic Comedy",9,27 March 2006,"The lead character in this film, Charles, says at one point that, while  his friends were busily obsessed with marriage, two members of their  group were, for all intents and purposes, married to each other. In  those days before Britain had a civil partnership law, he was referring  to Gareth and Matthew, played by Simon Callow and John Hannah. ""Four  Weddings and a Funeral"" was among the first major films to feature a  gay couple without any comment, moralizing, or stereotyping.  Considering all of the absurd controversy generated by ""Brokeback  Mountain,"" this English comedy may be considered subversive in some  quarters, because it portrays the union between the two men to be as  loving and enduring as any between the men and a women in the same  film.  The two gay men are among a circle of idiosyncratic friends that orbit  around Charles, who suffers from relationship avoidance. Played  engagingly by Hugh Grant, Charles attends the weddings of others,  but manages to avoid any commitment of his own. One of the film's  funniest scenes involves Charles at a wedding reception where he has  been seated at a table with several of his ex-girlfriends. With that  one scene, screenwriter Richard Curtis wittily fleshes out Charles's  character as each woman remarks on her past experience.  The episodic comedy is broken down literally into the five events of  the title, and the core characters attend these events as spectators  who each hope for a wedding of their own. Many of the lines and  situations are extremely funny. Rowan Atkinson steals his brief time as  a novice preacher who blesses a couple ""in the name of the Father, the  Son, and the holy goat."" Although Hugh Grant plays Charles as, well,  Hugh Grant, several other actors create some fine comic turns. The  ravishing Kristin Scott Thomas is touching as the lonely Fiona, and her  timing is impeccable when she recovers from an indelicate question with  a snappy comeback. Of course, why anyone as beautiful as Kristin Scott  Thomas should be unwillingly single is a minor casting flaw in the  film. Unfortunately, Andie MacDowell plays the American, Carrie, and,  although she looks great in a hat, she fails to generate the necessary  charisma to convincingly be Charles's object of desire.  However, the low wattage generated by the two leads does little to  dampen the hilarity or the pathos of this excellent film. While, at  nearly two hours, the movie is long for a comedy, the structure and  quirky characters easily sustain interest throughout. With ""Four  Weddings and a Funeral,"" director Mike Newell has made one of the best  romantic comedies, and the film holds up to repeated viewings.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

The relationship between the two is intense and funny all the way through and is a great watch for older audiences who can appreciate the ideas put forth by the director of 'Harry Potter and the goblet of fire' It's a typical love story with many conventions of the romance genre involving flirtatious conversations, wedding settings, stereotypical husbands, wives and singletons and are all brilliantly conveyed in an enthusiastic plot with likable characters and effect speaking.There are many surprising twists and turns and great laughs consistent throughout, making a very different story to your normal love stories for example 'nine months'.This story follows Grant throughout but there are many different story lines going on with different types of characters. Because there are different opinions being shared between the characters there is always a feel of real life and a relaxed atmosphere to this comedy.It is different from other love stories because there are many personal issues relating to the characters which make it emotional as well as chuckle-some. It's not a laugh out loud comedy, more chuckle-some but watch out for a scene where Grant is locked in a cupboard, one of the greatest scenes I've seen him in.The key theme throughout are the relationships between the characters and yes, many people will say it is predictable but at the end of the day it is enjoyable, funny, a good laugh if you want to sit down with your loved one and enjoy funny sex and relationship jokes.A definite watch because of the likable funny characters 8.5/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral

The structure and pace of the plot is brilliant and the cast, on the whole, are likeable and believable. Hugh Grant gives maybe his career-best performance and Simon Callow and John Hannah are exceptional. Sadly, the ending is very underwhelming and it's hard to get behind the main love story, given how insidiously unpleasant Andie MacDowell's character is.The highlight of the film is the amazing funeral speech given by John Hannah. It's a stunningly heartfelt piece of acting that catches you completely off guard. It's made all the more powerful by how brilliant Simon Callow was as Gareth and how lifeless and empty everything feels without him.I still don't fully understand why Carrie was written the way she was. Did the writers intend her to be someone we would grow to love? Or was she meant to be this selfish, narcissistic and deceitful? I originally thought it would be Charles' realisation of how shallow she was that would cause him to marry Fiona so they could all live happily ever after. Alas not. I also found it quite ridiculous that Charles would marry Henrietta within a year of getting back together with her, given how little spark there appeared to be between them.I would still highly recommend Four Weddings; it's charming, witty and provides a great snapshot of middle-class England in the 90s.

Humor is the priority of this film, but funny humor, not the stupid humor of nowadays which isn't funny at all.I think that the actors are all good and funny on their roles, but Hugh Grant steals the show as the ""alergic to weddings"" Charles. The comedian Rowan Atkinson has a small role (as Gerald, the priest in the second wedding). Although his role is almost minor, during those few minutes it's impossible not to laugh hysterically. Nothing else would be expected coming from Rowan Atkinson.""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" has also some gorgeous sceneries and images from Scotland: green places, big mountains, castles, old churches with fine architecture, etc...Overall, an okay comedy. One of the funniest English movies ever.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

65,RonellSowes,Eccentric Episodic Enjoyable,6,21 May 2021,"If you think this is a movie about weddings you would be correct in your assumption. The picture is told through a series of weddings and all but a few scenes take place during a ceremony. As the title suggests, mixed into all the weddings is one funeral. Which is a suprisingly somber moment for such a lighthearted movie and unlamentable character.Despite the fact that the movie is the same scenario done with the same characters four times, it manages to stay suprisingly fresh. You don't think that you're watching the same thing repeatedly; each sequence is unique, covers new ground and humorous.This movie was confronted with a precarious problem that it dealt with quite well. The film is comprised of a few separate scenes that are disconnected, episodic and must also must be different. Yet it has a continuous story to tell which has to stay ongoing. It manages to balance out both quite well with the main storyline remaining intact and able to steadily move forward while the surrounding aspects are individually imaginative.Four Weddings And A Funeral is full of comedy that you're not sure if you should cringe or laugh at and quirky characters that have enough charm to not be annoying despite they're eccentricities. And it's a decent motion picture overall, regardless of your feelings towards the genre.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
66,MattyGibbs,Brilliant British Rom-Com,10,7 December 2015,"Four Weddings and a Funeral was a smash hit on release and it's easy to see why. A brilliant British cast and a funny clever and witty script make this a must see. It follows a myriad of characters as they intertwine as the title suggests four weddings and a funeral. What's great this film is that it is full of great characters. Hugh Grant leads the way as the charming Charles who finds it hard to settle down. Whilst Grant is superb he is by no means the only one with plenty of pitch perfect performances from the likes of Simon Callow, John Hannah and Kristin Scott Thomas. The only real weak link is Andie MacDowell but even though she has been slated for her performance it's not the worst in the world. This is a film full of genuinely funny moments but also some sad ones. The funeral is genuinely touching and uses the poem 'Funeral Blues' to great effect. This is a film that is entertaining from start to finish and as well as Grant's finest moment, for me is the best Rom-Com ever made. Highly recommended.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
67,silverscreen888,The Best Comedy About Commitment I Know Of; Charming and Humorous,7,5 August 2007,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" belongs, with its characters, obsessions, wry humor, Establishment bashing, music, attitudes and scenes to the 1970s. It was not made until 1994 .The story appears from the outset to be about young people obsessed with sex, love and finding their way in a bewildering society of expectations but few responsibilities. We begin and end the film without knowing what anyone does for a living, except Hamish (the unfortunate choice of the heroine as a first husband). But we come to know all the characters through their attitudes toward love, which is the fact that I suggest accounts for their unusual memorability, even where one cannot keep so many similar characters clearly separated in the mind. Mike Newell directed what had to be a hellishly-difficult series of similar but differing weddings, social gathering rooms, ceremonies, conversations, traffic adventures and interiors; so the remarkable achievement was his, to me, as well as that of the producers, production designer Maggie Gray and cinematographer Mike Coulter; because despite this multiplicity of scenes, hundreds of costumes and indoor and outdoor challenges, the film looks remarkably of a piece. Tim Bevan is the credited producer, and wonderfully appropriate music was provided by Richard Rodney Bennett. Set Decorator Anna Pinnock and costume designer Lindy Hemming also earned high accolades for making every scene look real and interesting at the same time. From makeup and hair stylings to lighting and set dressings, this film, I claim, is a low-budget triumph. The complex script by Richard Curtis is filled with charming comedic moments, one liners, revealing statements and reactions. As the hero, a man struggling toward commitment, Hugh Grant has what I regard as his best early role, opposite Andie MacDowell, who does well with her part also. Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, John Hannah, James Fleet and David Bower all are given winning moments. Pert Charlotte Coleman is a scene stealer, as are Rowan Atkinson as a novice minister, Simon Kunz, Kenneth Griffith as the mad old man, David Haig, Sophie Thompson, Timothy Walker, Sarah Crowe, and Anna Chancellor as Henrietta. Among the film's many highlights are Hugh Grant's speech as the best man at Wedding One, the eulogy for Gareth at the funeral, and the mad dashes Grant and his sister make when they are late for nearly every event. The theme of the film--that commitment to the right person is harder than it looks and a bit scary but necessary is enacted here in a plot that interweaves more than a dozen young people's lives. But it is the change in the hero, played by Hugh Grant, and Carrie, portrayed by Andie Macdowell, that are the vital center of the piece. Watch also for the charming still-photo montage at the ending, complete with Princess Diana and a Labrador Retriever. This is a film I find to to be feckless, charming, interesting, very funny, filled with visible and audial bits, put-down lines and involving confrontations, agreements and conversations about commitment. I judge this to be a very watchable comedy, one with a suitable ending, and a film that will bear repeated viewings. It is a screwball comedy decades after such films were thought to be improbable, but it has genuinely touching and off-the-wall moments mixed into a good-hearted melange of friendships and rivalries. Recommended highly--for its near-unimportance and for its importantly triumphant realization on screen.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

Normally British films to me are kind of an mix bag for me and what I mean is sometimes I will enjoy or be bored by movies from Britain. I don't know why it just happens, and this is coming from a guy who is from Britain. I was a bit shocked when I find out that this movie won best film at BAFTA awards and knocked the highest grossing movie of all time Titanic, and to the people who liked this movie more than Titanic that's fine but to me in my personal opinion this movie was okay.Let's start of with the positive: The acting from everyone was solid and this movie has a great cast.The movie did make me laugh at times with characters doing whacky things that no normal person would do at a wedding yeah those kind of jokes.I'm not going to spoil anything but these a scene where there are at this funeral and one of the characters give a sad and kind of moving speech.Now for things that didn't work for me: I didn't really think this movie is on the level of amazing as some has put it out to be, I'm saying it's bad I honestly think it's just okay.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

Reading the other reviews that seems to be the reverse of what the American reviewers thought. I like Andie MacDowell, although she didn't vary her act much, but I didn't like Hugh Grant, who didn't vary his act at all. American reviewers thought the opposite, except for Hugh Grant. This film is also far too politically correct. At least, it is for me. It's a comedy, but it isn't funny, unless you think Hugh Grant is funny, just for being himself, as always. The Britishness is wildly overdone, and so is the social cross-section. The language is witlessness inspired, especially the wedding service by Mr Bean. The events are uninteresting.

Of course, there have been many characters who have to hide their true feelings and work on their advantage, but they have enough reasons and stories behind their action. This one is just being safe and even selfish. Just not relatable, silly, and capricious. So it takes hard time for audience to figure out why Charles is so in love with her. She seems genuinely loving Hamish at one point, and she turns to Charles for comfort at the other. Boring storyline and weak characterization. His ex-girlfriend describes him a serial monogamist. At the same time, he desperately looks for one true love but does not want to get married. So many forms of love mixed into one person and not enough explanation to back that up. Until Charles asks Carrie not to marry him forever, I could have not realized that he is against the concept of marriage.

73,avik-basu1889,There is a greatness to this film's sweetness !!!,8,9 July 2016,"Generally I get repulsed by the term romantic-comedy. On 75% of the times, the films belonging to this genre, specially the ones that are made in the Hollywood system, tend to come across as very shoddy and utterly artificial products made by money-making committees. However 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is an exception. No matter how many times I watch this film, I find myself getting charmed by the inherent and inescapable sweetness of it.One of the reasons why it works could be the fact that the film is extremely British in an almost unapologetic way. All the characters exude this Victorian charm that works on me every time. Hugh Grant himself plays this awkward character that I can in a sense relate with. Although like other romantic-comedies, the primary theme of this film is finding love, but 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is also very much about friendship. This is an ensemble piece and every character apart from Charles also gets his/her fair share of presence. I believed the friendship between them. I have to mention Kristin Scott Thomas. She is brilliant as Fiona. She expresses so much with her eyes. It's her emotional vulnerability that she expresses through her eyes even though her outward appearance remains as assured,confident and elegant as ever throughout the film.It is very intelligently directed by Mike Newell. He knows exactly when to cut to which face to get a particular reaction. His sense of comic timing is also brilliant. The screenplay by Richard Curtis is certainly not short of clichés, but there is a sweetness to it, that Newell elevates to the next level through his directing.'Four Weddings and a Funeral' is certainly not a 'great' film in the artistic sense of the word. It has some of the clichés that you would expect a romantic-comedy to have. But the British charm, elegance and Hugh Grant's lovable awkwardness works every time I watch it. It is a feelgood film that makes you want to get together with our friends and enjoy yourself.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

Carrie is a complicated American woman, who after initial interest starts to pretty much torment old Charles. But Charles is in love and desperately wants things to work out? Will they or won't they?

77,dr_clarke_2,"Unashamedly middle-class with a smug air and a profoundly irritating female lead, but very, very funny",8,13 March 2021,"Written by Richard Curtis, Mike Newell's 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral is an unashamedly middle-class comedy with a smug air and a profoundly irritating female lead character. It is however very, very funny.
The plot of Four Weddings and Funeral is largely reflected by its title, with a story that follows a group of friends over several months as they attend four weddings and, well, a funeral. The main character is Hugh Grant's Charles, who meets Andie MacDowell's Carrie at the first wedding and rapidly falls in love, the path of which naturally fails to run smoothly. Along the way, the various other characters fall in love, get married and attend the funeral of Simon Callow's Gareth after he dies of a heart attack at wedding number three. Most of the characters don't have surnames and none of them have jobs: what little we learn of them comes from their dialogue, but that turns out to be all that is needed.
Director Newell reportedly insisted that Curtis make the characters real rather than simply funny, and the collaboration paid off; over the course of the film, we feel as though we have got to know these characters (even though we haven't) and started to care about them. The film manages to be poignant as well as funny, largely without being mawkish, for example when Kristin Scott Thomas's Fiona finally tells Charles that she's always loved him. Ultimately however, it is a feel-good movie, with even the funeral turning into a joyous celebration of Gareth's life.
For all the skilful storytelling however, the real success here is that Curtis keeps the jokes flowing thick and fast and the film delivers relentlessly, belly laughs, such as during Gerald's stammering, bungled officiating at Bernard and Lydia's wedding. The film is a comedy of errors, from the opening scene of Charles and his flatmate waking up late for the wedding at which he is the best man through the spectacular social gaffs to which he is prone. Much of the humour comes from sheer embarrassment, either of the characters themselves or for others because of, for example, their atrocious singing. From the funeral onwards, the jokes start to dry up, as the story heads for its conclusion, but by that point the audience has got to know the characters enough that this doesn't matter as much as one might expect.
The performances are almost all note perfect, with Newell largely assembling a cast of British television comic actors, including James Fleet, Rowan Atkinson and David Haig, and seasoned thespians such as Callow, who is wonderfully plummy as Gareth. Hugh Grant however is the undoubted star: he had already appeared in several critically acclaimed films by this point, but his starring turn as Charles was the breakout role that brought him international fame, as he bungles and bumbles his way through the foppish character's well-meaning but ill-judged dialogue. The single weak link is Andie MacDowell, who is frequently wooden as Carrie; her delivery of the line ""is-it-still-raining-I-hadn't-noticed"" is a low point.
Newell makes good use of the extensive location filming in London and the Home Counties, with plenty of nice touches such as the often hilarious subtitles and the use of still photographs at the end to reveal what happens to the characters. Points are deducted for the use of Wet Wet Wet's cover of ""Love is All Around"", a mawkish earworm that haunted the UK singles charts for weeks, but for the most part Four Weddings and Funeral remains as gloriously funny today as it did in 1994.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

79,dy158,When love is next to you,8,1 March 2014,"Charles (Hugh Grant) has always been afraid of marriage commitments. But he and his group of fellow friends who are also single including his female flatmate Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) have always been able to find themselves being invited to weddings, while searching for the true meaning of love at these events.Charles would become the best man in the first, where his friend Angus (Timothy Walker) is marrying Laura (Sara Crowe). But he was almost late. Still, he manages to arrive at the church in time. It was at this wedding where he first met Carrie (Andie MacDowell), an American who had been invited to the ceremony. It became love at first sight for Charles, and the two would spend the night together.The second is the wedding of Bernard (David Haig) and Lydia (Sophie Thompson), where Charles would come to find himself face-to-face with several of his ex-girlfriends relating embarrassing stories about him, including one his friends has always called 'Duckface' in Henrietta (Anna Chancellor). He would meet Carrie again, but this time her Scottish fiancé is also at the ceremony in politician Sir Hamish Banks (Corin Redgrave).He would find himself being invited to Carrie's wedding, which becomes the third in the film. Though in the lead-up, he had actually accidentally came across Carrie in a shop while shopping for presents himself. Charles would find himself having the unenviable task of helping Carrie select her wedding dress, though it was what Carrie would later tell him about her past which surprised him. While he did attend Carrie's wedding which took place in Scotland after all, it would eventually be marred by one of his friends Gareth (Simon Callow) who died suddenly of a heart attack, leading to the funeral which Charles would attend and meeting Carrie being of Gareth's.The fourth and final wedding in the film would be of Charles's, though the appearance of Carrie without her husband Hamish until Charles learned the full story between Carrie and her husband before the ceremony starts made him think twice of whom he really wants to spend the rest of his life with, with his deaf brother David (David Bower) and friend Matthew (John Hannah) helping him out to decide.What makes this film appealing and charming is how the group of friends in the film, with Hugh Grant's Charles being among them who are proud to be single themselves, are constantly searching for the meaning of 'one true love' and whether it exists at the weddings they go to and unexpectedly at the funeral of one of their friends who had died. But there is also Grant's character and whether his 'one true love' was right there all along.It is the film which gives one the feel-good factor about love and romance, making us still want to believe in love again. It is also the film which makes one want to believe in the 'happily-ever-afters'.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

For an unknown reason, MacDowell marries some Scottish guy in the third wedding and you should know by then what would happen in the funeral and the next wedding. There is a bunch of fun characters as the humor free flows for the first half of the movie, then they do the same all over again which is when the true color of the movie comes out as it depends completely on Hugh Grant's despicable histrionics.

Was, but I don't remember having any other manor issues with it. After just barely making it through it recently, I can't fathom how this shallow insipid uninspired effort at a romantic comedy garnered anything more than a 4 average. With a few exceptions, the acting was some of the worst I've witnessed in a film with this type of hype and budget. Hugh Grant is usually at least tolerable in his silly roles but not here. He's just a moron to be honest, and plays one rather poorly. Why would anyone want him as a friend? But honestly his friends were nothing that spectacular either. The scenes were all very clumsy and sophmoric, with hideously bad dialogue and over exaggerated posturing. Especially KST. Go to weddings, get plastered, dance like fools and spout drivel that's supposed to be deep and meaningful. Tedious nonsense. The only somewhat moving scene was the funeral mentioned in the title. Back to Andie M. If everything else in this movie was stellar, her wooden performance and monotone dialogue delivery would have been enough to drag it into the muck of mediocrity. While she was no standout in Michael, she was far superiour than she was in this nightmare. Everyone needed to be slapped here, and slapped repeatedly. Too bad such a slick and polished production was wasted on this, as none of these characters deserved anything positive to happen to them. Rowan A. Was hilarious in his small role, and it's likely the only thing I'll recall in the future if anyone asks my opinion of this rubbish. If it wasn't over the top stupid it was cliched and corny. I might have to give Notting Hill another try and see if it disappoints as bad as this one. The music was bad but not as distracting as all the other problems.

Likewise, Grant spilling out his words of love to Andie McDowell, beside the Thames, was also brilliant.Aswell as it being hilarious, there is the sadness too, which all true good comedies can achieve.People forget, this films sells itself as a comedy, with a romantic subplot. Not the other way around, so fact their romance came together in an unusual way should be neither here nor there. One idiot below even commented that the scene with the rings was hard to believe as other guests would've offered there rings instead of the comical rings. It's a extended sit-com, not an Agatha Christie novel.Admittedly I don't like Andie McDowell, infact she is poor, but that's the only criticism you can level at this film. This is English humour. People were aware of differences in humour between between America & Australia & Europe, years ago, but still, years on, persist in trying to get comedies to be a hit all over the world. I doubt there'll ever achieve it. People are just brought up on completely contrasting TV programmes, depending on where they're from.I can imagine people who don't laugh at this are the sort who sit in hysterics at such sidesplitters as the childish 'penis in the apple pie' or masturbation type gags in American Pie or any of the equally unamusing, ill-informed romanticised crap that was in the Wedding Singer. Excuse me while I sow my sides back up. (I've just remembered that hilarious scene where a bloke done nothing but impersonate Boy George).

I own this film on DVD, and probably watch it 6 or 8 times a year...not counting the times I plug it in just to see a scene or two. It is frequently VERY funny, and sometimes quite touching as well. The scene wherein Charlie (Hugh Grant) is stuck dining at a table with several of his old girl friends is one of the funniest short scenes ever captured on film. Kristin Scott-Thomas gives a marvelously understated performance as the woman who's carried a torch for Charlie for years, and the movie must be watched several times in order to see that she's been giving hints about it all the way through. The casting on this film is almost flawless, with the exception -- just my opinion -- of Andie McDowell. Her character just doesn't strike me as being worthy of the way Charlie feels about her, but -- given how she was written -- I'm not sure any other actress could've made me like her any better. Perhaps the point is that love is beyond explanation, and we need simply to accept it when it comes, without questioning why. I love romantic comedies, and this is definitely in my top 3. See it.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
92,jaredpahl,British Rom-Com 101,8,4 May 2021,"The British romantic comedy has become a favorite genre of mine in recent years. Hugh Grant has become a favorite actor. Andie MacDowell has become a favorite actress. This movie, the one that kicked off the craze that led to About a Boy, Love Actually, and Bend It Like Beckham- a couple favorites and a soccer movie I like well-enough- is a perfectly charming template for the genre of dry English wit and light romance, but it's not quite a favorite.Charles' (Hugh Grant) friends are getting married. Each wedding seems to bring another couple together, while he stays put in relationship limbo. Complicating matters is a vexing American, Carrie (Andie MacDowell) who somehow shows up to... Four Weddings and a Funeral. The rest follows the basic When Harry Met Sally outline, two acquaintances slowly learning that they love each other.The difference, and what sets Mike Newell's film apart, is its very British sensibilities. That's the real charm of Four Weddings. Hugh Grant is in his nascent stage as the bumbling toff, and while his performance doesn't have quite the complexity of later roles, where he was funnier and more believably vulnerable, it's still quintessential Hugh Grant. I'm a fan of that. The supporting roles, as in other Richard Curtis-written films, are quite rich. Solid British character actors, as always, in some funny, quirky roles. It's always a delight to see Rowan Atkinson pop up in a movie and his big scene may be the best in the whole film. As a palette cleanser to all the tea and crumpets, Andie MacDowell does her job, although the character is a weak spot. There is so little in the way of background for Carrie, that you can almost imagine Charles' friends simply taking her out of storage just to attend weddings. Andie MacDowell is a special actress though, so effortlessly sparkling it's like she doesn't realize she's an actress at all. She salvages a lot from Carrie.The film hits every emotional beat you expect a well-made rom-com to hit: humor, romance, melancholy, sadness, inspiration, and finally joy, but Four Weddings and a Funeral is only basically moving. I like Hugh Grant. I like Andie MacDowell. I want to see them get together. They get together. By that measure, the movie is a success. I don't discount that it's also a real chuckle-inducer and tear-conjurer. But it's just on that first level that the movie works. I don't believe Four Weddings and a Funeral has much real to say about love and relationships. It tells us that you should only marry someone you're fully, completely in love with. On that I agree, but let's be real, this is not a profound observation. Four Weddings and a Funeral gets by on charm. Lots of 90s, British, jolly-good charm.76/100.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
93,jasminn_tan,Classic British Romance Movie,7,12 January 2020,"Hugh Grant had a knack of getting himself into roles that required him to fall in love with an American woman and this is really just another movie of him stumbling over his words while confessing his love to his on-screen love interest. I thought the chemistry between Grant and Macdowell was... lacking but the side characters' humour more than made up for it. This movie was funny and it provided a good distraction for a Sunday evening as the group of friends found themselves growing up and finding true love. The funeral bit broke my heart, especially because it happened to someone with so much life left in him. Their friendships were also one of the best things about this movie because they understood each other and always had each other's backs.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

95,Travis_Bickle01,Seen as one of the classics in the British romantic comedies,7,30 March 2005,"Fine romantic comedy with Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell and Kristin Scott Thomas. This movies is seen as one of the classics in the British romantic comedies. It's not bad, it's good, funny and entertaining. I liked seeing it. The story is good, fine characters and there are several amusing moments in this movie. Maybe a little overrated at the BAFTA's. ""Four weddings and a funeral"" was nominated for 11 BAFTA's and won 4 of them. The British were wrong by seeing Hugh Grant's performance (although he is pretty good) superior to Tom Hanks' performance in ""Forrest Gump"". You can't deny the fact that they were wrong by doing this.Furthermore I also think that ""Nothing Hill"" and ""About a boy"" (two other romantic comedies, both starring Hugh Grant) are much better. So if you would like to see a British romantic comedy, i would advice you to see one of these. ""About a boy"" was one of the best Hugh Grant-movies I have ever seen (but I haven't seen ""Love Actually"" yet).""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is a fine and entertaining movie with good performances, although the movie may be a little overrated. 7,5/10",Four Weddings and a Funeral

You just cannot go wrong with Hugh Grant and romantic comedies, and Four Weddings & a Funeral is the perfect chick flick of romance, humor, and most importantly GREAT CONVERSATION. There are so many little scenes and snipets that are just brilliant little skits that are wrapped around into an interesting love story.Though the love isn't compelling between the two main characters and there could be minor plot tweaks, there's a lot of great things about this British film that I'm sorry that more films can't take away from.High expectations I had, and disappointed I was not. Possibly one of the greatest romantic comedies that I've witnessed thus far. Hugh Grant was superb, the leading gal was alright.. .but there is a great supporting cast. I can't hate a well written movie.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
97,n-mo,Not worth the disc it's burned onto...,2,12 September 2008,"... let alone the silver halide it has forever corrupted, for that matter. The death of film is a tragic thing, but I will be grateful for the day when that great medium is no longer tainted and insulted by endless contemporary tripe such as this.I heard about this movie because I was talking to a friend about ""Death at a Funeral"" and somehow he'd not heard of that one--but boy, had he heard about ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" And one after another people started asking me if I'd seen the latter--and insisting that I MUST!But, why?? Why, why, why, why, WHY??Warning: do not go in expecting anything like ""Death at a Funeral"" or you will be deeply sorry. There are some incredible differences here:1. ""Death"" had impeccable black comedy timing from start to finish. All of the funny scenes in ""Four Weddings"" revolve around minor characters, all of whom were primarily centered around the second wedding: the desperate bridesmaid-turned-bride, her even more desperate suitor, and the newly-ordained Roman Catholic priest Father Gerald to whom falls the unfortunate task of marrying them--but while his liturgical blunders were amusing enough, by the time he got to the end of the Rite and was still screwing up every other word, I was ready to say, ""Okay, Monsieur l'Abbé, let's move it along, now!"" And I'm not sure I laughed once after the second reception was over. The funeral was just cheesy, and totally unnecessary--but actually, the entire film was unnecessary, so that's a petty complaint.2. ""Death"" had a coherent, engaging plot from start to finish. ""Four Weddings"" does not. The excuse, I know, will be that the story was not plot-driven but character-driven, but more on that below.3. The characters in ""Death"" were all real people, and all of them--even the shallow, marketable, jet-setting Gotham-dwelling novelist--burn their dignity at the stake for the sake of those they love. For a black comedy, it was surprisingly inspirational. But the characters in ""Four Weddings""? Insipid, unsympathetic, promiscuous and totally implausible. A grown man lives in a flat with a young girl--and there's no scandal there?? A group of friends that seems never to have left high school? The obligatory queer couple that must factor into every romantic montage in the P.C. post-modern cinema?Charles starts out somewhat sympathetically, a seemingly nice and reserved young man who just can't seem to commit... but gradually we learn WHY he can't commit, and it's not pretty. (Also... Hugh Grant cannot act.) And Carrie? She had to be lying when she claims she's jumped over thirty men. How on Earth could anyone sleep with her once, let alone fall in love with her? From the minute I saw her at the first wedding I could see she had ""b****"" written all over her. (Also... if I thought GRANT couldn't act...)4. ""Death"" was a showcase of amazing British dramatic talent. The actors in ""Four Weddings"" are pathetic, mostly because of the lame story they have to work with. (The aforementioned three minor characters are the exceptions.) Clearly, the casting of Andie MacDowell was deliberately done to drive home an anti-American theme, and it worked quite well. I relish the scene where she says, ""As for the rest of you (i.e., the British in the room), I'd have thought that lots of frightful Americans flying in was an excuse for staying away, so I thank you, too."" You're not welcome, sweetheart. If I knew she'd be there, I would find every excuse to stay away from Scotland.This being said, the film does do a couple of things right. First, there's the theme of marriage: it's a good thing, a constant, a necessity, and Charles finally starts to realise that his eternal bachelorhood counts for little, particularly when all his friends are getting married. (Not that he's inclined to do anything productive about it, alas.) Second, I liked seeing one Low Church, one Roman Catholic, one Presbyterian and one High Church wedding... a nice showcase of the British cultural landscape. And of course anyone who knows me will not be surprised to hear that I appreciated that the only funny characters (and the ones who seemed to enjoy paying the marital debt the most) were the Catholics.Shame, however, that none of that could make up for the movie.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

Hugh Grant plays the lead role of Charles in typical Grant fashion,charming,lovely,well dressed gentleman,etc. It was basically the film that put him on the map as well as getting a Golden Globe and BAFTA Award along the way. The film also has an alright supporting cast including a few well known faces such as Andie MacDowell,Kristin Scott Thomas and Rowan Atkinson.

99,jckruize,Droll romantic comedy showcases Hugh Grant in his best role.,9,28 February 2002,"Richard Curtis, author of Rowan Atkinson's sublime Blackadder TV series, here contributes a romantic comedy screenplay which is actually romantic AND actually funny.  American hacks should take note:  it's possible to write comedy based on the battle of the sexes that doesn't rely on misogyny and gross-out humor.Hugh Grant at his most charming leads a talented ensemble cast in this warm-hearted tale of unrequited and requited love that so impressed stodgy Academy voters it actually got a Best Picture nomination.  I won't quibble with those who say it was undeserving -- although some of the other user comments are ridiculously hostile to such a lightweight romp -- but I will defend its makers for crafting a genuine crowd-pleaser that relies on story, character and witty dialogue for its appeal. The essence of good romantic comedy is what Curtis and director Mike Newell capture particularly well in this film (more effectively than Curtis' other Grant hit, NOTTING HILL) and it's this:  love makes us do stupid things.  We err in choice, we blunder in execution, we make utter fools of ourselves, and yet we don't give up.  We still strive.  We still search for that perfect someone.  And the glory is -- sometimes we get lucky.Going along on this quest with Grant and friends is as enjoyable an entertainment as you're lucky to find in your local DVD section.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
100,shimenpf,"For me, a little dull",6,27 October 2019,"I'm a huge Richard Curtis fan. He wrote About Time, my favorite movie ever, so I had high hopes for Four Weddings and a Funeral.
I think the premise is interesting. The way Hugh Grant's character stumbles upon the same girl over the course of those five social occasions and falls in love is charming. However, I never felt the movie hooked me, and my personal opinion is that it happened because:
I never felt connected to the characters. There wasn't a particular scene (or set of scenes) dedicated on building that connection, which, for me, make it hard to care about their journey.
The movie lacks conflict. Since Hugh's character doesn't have a clear goal until the third act, it's hard to keep the audience interested. Hugh isn't trying to accomplish much almost until the mall scene, where he goes after her. It's normal for a romantic film to have a very thin plot, but this one felt too thin for me.
The movie abuses dialogue. A lot of chatting. Even if the dialogue has purpose, it's too dull to watch characters talking for 2/3 of the movie.
Now, this is not an awful movie by any means. In fact, I loved the third act. Right when Gallager passes away, the movie takes a turn and becomes much more engaging. The characters suffer the death of a beloved friend. That makes me relate to them (unfortunately, it's almost until the end). And the dilemma Hugh faces right in the middle of the wedding, and the way it was played with the deaf friend helping him out, was elegant and succeeded nicely.
So, overall, not a bad movie, but could certainly improve in a few areas.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
101,jofitz27,Disappointingly unfunny and sour,4,27 April 2005,"Whoever said this was a 'classic' comedy or that it 'set the standard for future British rom/coms' was bang out of line. This is everything a romantic comedy should not be; stereotypical, clichéd and downright vulgar and unfunny.Charles (typical Hugh Grant) is a bit of a playboy. He's late (again) for a Wedding, forgetting the ring. In a desperately unfunny scene, the ring is replaced. The part that got this film a 4 out of a 10 is quick to follow, though. One of the funniest, cleverest scenes you will see on screen; Rowan Atkinson, a gem, 'mis-pronouncing' some of the Wedding proceedings in a moment of downright hilarity.But nothing even vaguely humorous follows (save maybe the American girls 'when will we get engaged' scene) but apart from that it is crude and unfunny. No doubt critics would love it; it has all the elements of 'British Pride' in it. But a dreadfully stereotypical ending really blows this down, not that the preceding part were any better.

102,Putzberger,Four Set Pieces and a Tragedy,9,19 November 2006,"The weddings are funny, the funeral is sad, and if you like romantic comedies with a touch of bitterness, 4W+1F equals a winning equation. The dialogue is fantastic: clever and effortless in the way that only the British seem able to manage. Plus there is some decent slapstick and the performing cast is excellent. Which is good, because, oddly, the film's greatest weakness is its central love story between Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell. They're both pretty, sure, but neither of them is exactly a great actor. Hugh Grant is so bloody mannered you wonder if he might be a blinking, stammering wind-up doll. But at least his comic timing is sharp, and his self-effacing schtick manages to move the plot forward: even if he can't convey loss, pain or remorse, through his hyper-indicativeness you can at least tell what he's supposed to be feeling. And unlike his fellow automaton-actor Michael J ""Go to expression # 37"" Fox, Grant at least has the courage to be cast as (if not actually portray) unheroic characters. Charles is a gossipy, irresponsible but charming mess, just the sort of bloke who might be found cheating on his beautiful girlfriend with a Hollywood hooker. (Note: that doesn't happen in the movie.) As Carie, the beautiful but troubled romantic heroine, Andie is less successful. She's convincing as that unattainable object of desire until she opens her mouth: her line readings are as monotonous as her character. Some of it isn't her fault: much of her dialogue has a particularly British lilt, which always sounds a bit odd in an American accent. The character is American for very good reason, and the scriptwriter should have Yankfied her speech some. Still, Andie was never cast in anything because of her great dramatic range. Why were the producers stuck with MacDowell? Well, blame demographics. This movie came out in 1994, exactly five years between two waves of American actresses who might have carried the role off much better: Demi or Jodie in 1989, Gwyneth or Cameron in 1999.But honestly, the limitations of the two main characters are minor distractions. You've got some of the finest British actors of their generations enjoying themselves tremendously: Simon Callow as Gareth, the boisterous, fun-loving poofter and Kristin Scott Thomas as Fiona, doomed to be always disappointed in love but enduring her misery with a cigarette and a wisecrack. (In truth, she's a far more compelling character than Carrie, and almost as beautiful.) And the funeral sequence is the best part of the film: as Matthew, John Hanna delivers a beautifully written eulogy with a clipped dramatic economy that obviates histrionics and deepens the sense of mourning. And flanking the funeral are the four title ceremonies, hilarious not because they're exaggerated but because they're painfully accurate: the awkwardness and the awfulness will be instantly familiar to anyone who has ever attended a wedding and stayed sober enough to know what's going on.

I understand now why I don't remember it, I probably deliberately blocked it from my memory. The story is pathetically boring and embarrassingly not funny. I don't remember Andie MacDowell being such a horrible actress, but she sure is bad in this. Hugh Grant plays the very same person in every single movie he's in, and his bumbling englishman persona just gets worse and worse. The second wedding where he's hiding while the bride and groom have sex just did me in. He goes from there to some weeping whiny girl in the hall with ridiculous dialogue, then back into a horribly written scene with more ridiculously insipid dialogue with the one-dimensional MacDowell.

Perhaps I would have been more interested if this was called ""Four Chainsaws & a demon in deep space"" so I admit bias as I am just not a RomCom girl. Sorry.There is some good acting talent in this, apart from Andie MacDowell who is very pretty, but she can't act her way out of a cardboard box, which lets this film down a lot. The overall characters are weak. There is supposed to be comedy, but there isent any. & the whole film seems to be obsessed with denigrating the institution of marriage, English traditions & British middle classes. This is perhaps an early atempt at social messages in movies & it does not come across as very good. Also I do believe this movie was over hyped & very over rated.Oh well. on to the suitabillity: I would rate this as a 14+ simply for over use of the F word, because the script repeats this over & over as if it is supposed to be funny. Using the F word in stead of writing great comedy is a sell out!
There are several simulated sex scenes, which are done for comedy effect but don't come across as funny, & be prepared for an ending that literally fizzels out with no explanation.This movie could have been a shining becon for the return of British filmaking, but for me it is just flat & one dimentional & in parts cringe worthy. I prefere the Ealing & Hammer comedys (yes Hammer did comedy) of yesteryear. Heck! I must confess that I am a ""Carry On"" fan!

105,teejayniles2345,A farce featuring British Urban Stuck-ups (and American suck-ups),10,23 February 2002,"I do like this movie (rating it a 10*) but am amazed when I rented it again recently from the video store how much the British YUPPIES were unabashedly stuck-up.  Granted that we are watching them at their most sexually ""full-blast"" modes, they seem to have no view of consequences for their self-absorption.  The down-to-earth childhood rhyme ""first comes love, next comes marriage, then comes Hugh pushing the baby carriage"" only gets fulfillment with the finally included still photographs of the characters in the near future. The most ludicrous of the four is the final WEDDING where the major character admits that he would prefer being in love with another to paying attention to Hen, his on-again, off-again love interest who is in full bridal costume standing next to him.  The wedding theme of the picture is lovely and enthralling; the consequences of being more committed to one's tag-along companions than to a monogamous partner are indirectly put forward as the ""cause"" of Gareth's death, one might theorize.  I do recommend this film even if you find yourself with mouth agape at the hedonists and big-mouths/awful liars who get front and center attention.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
106,cleary-joshua,"A quirky British romcom, from a great film year...",7,28 May 2014,"It is extremely possible that 1994 was the greatest year of film ever. Yes, we have ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" and ""North"" to slightly disprove that, but here's my argument. 1994 is one of the few years when all five Best Picture nominees at the Oscars have gone on to be considered classics. ""Forrest Gump"" won the top award, now an extremely controversial choice given that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were also both nominated. Also nominated was ""Quiz Show"", a lesser known but still excellent drama with Ralph Fiennes. And one more film – a quirky British romcom known as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".The film centres around the five events described in the title, and the main character Charles, played by Hugh Grant, and his friends. Charles constantly bumps into Carrie, an attractive American woman, at these events and very quickly falls in love with her. The events themselves play host to a number of bizarre and humorous characters, with Rowan Atkinson's vicar being one of the film's greatest components, despite only being in a short scene. One of my biggest problems with the film is Hugh Grant. Perhaps it's the curse of not being a teenage girl that I find him more irritating than likable, and therefore cannot really understand why women keep falling for him. To his merit, however, he plays the bumbling English fool very well at times and just about carries off the film's romantic element.The film's greatest strengths are its sharp script, written by British romcom stalwart Richard Curtis, and superb supporting cast. Simon Callow is the finest of these, bringing across his character's outrageous lines with an incredibly likable quality. John Hannah and James Fleet also play great characters, and each have set pieces to showcase their talents. The place where the film surprised me most was the funeral, which is extremely emotionally charged, and Hannah's reading of Auden's ""Funeral Blues"" is highly moving. Kristen Scott Thomas' character is less enjoyable, and her confession to Charles at the third wedding feels unnecessary.But despite so many great aspects, the film isn't perfect, and while it's likable for the majority, it does lose a lot of its flow towards the end. The overall plot has a formula which it sticks to fairly rigidly, and feels a tiny bit forced at times. Perhaps it's a sign of how romcoms have changed now, but the ending feels extremely clichéd, and is predictable from the get-go. It's got great moments and is worth watching if just for its Great British cast, but unfortunately is not consistent enough to be carried off really well.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
107,Rozinda,Some entertaining cameos but as a whole it's nothing special other than the manifest attractions of Hugh Grant,6,26 November 2009,"It's quite an entertaining movie but I don't see why so much fuss has always been made about it, unless it's because the British Film Industry has been in the relative doldrums for so long that anything reasonable was over-hyped? It has some great cameos in the earlier part of the movie, but the later part drags. I find it difficult to appreciate some of the characters especially when they start to act pretentious. I felt it was rather a mistake to have so many well-known ""character"" actors in the same movie. A few less of Charles's ""set"" of familiar faces would have helped a lot because most of their characters/scripts were pretty boring.The central story, of Charles and Angie I found rather tedious too and this is the other reason I can't rate this movie highly even though Hugh Grant is an absolute sweetie and lifts any movie quite a bit nearer the stratosphere. I have to say though that I didn't decide that the first time I saw him, which was the first time I saw this movie, simply because I grew irritated with Charles' very fashionable, at the time, determination not to commit and the pretty silly ending in which he anxiously insists there mustn't be any commitment - OK, the wording is funny for a few seconds, until you realise how daft it is. To those of us who don't find commitment a problem it just sounds immature and I would pity any kids of this union, and even Angie as she has to put up with this immature guy's attitude. Well, perhaps he'd change in time.These days, the relentless determination that everyone must be ""free to come and go as they like"" in relationships has become rather sour as relationships become more and more problematic due to young people knowing no different from feckless parents and creating havoc for kids. Watching this movie again now, I felt it was very dated. Unfortunately too, there's no real charisma between Andie McDowell and Hugh Grant even though they are both trying hard and that's another reason I didn't rate Hugh Grant so much then as I do now. Watch Grant and Julia Roberts (Notting Hill) or Sandra Bullock (Two Weeks' Notice) and my, what a difference! With those lovely ladies who have such enormous charisma of their own, Hugh is perfect too - he's dynamite gorgeous just as they are and the poignant moments are brutally brilliant and I can watch both those movies over and over. Of course Hugh's done other splendid work too. It seems a shame he's so much remembered for this rather ordinary movie rather than some other far better movies he's made - that one about the man going up the hill and coming down the mountain is quite one of his best. Another aspect of the charisma or lack of it is the curiosity that Andie McDowell had far better charisma with the Scot she marries earlier in the story after rejecting Charles. It was impossible to imagine why she'd leave the guy after those tender glances in the wedding scenes and go rushing back to Charles - she even looks as though really she can't make out why she's left the Scot for Charles and Charles doesn't seem all that sure why he's got her back. Whilst I doubt this movie could ever, for me, reach the heights because of the other themes often overwhelming it, a different leading lady (or a different leading man) would have helped.This is not meant as a criticism of Grant or McDowell. As I said, they put their hearts into it and are both delightful on screen. It's just they don't have anything that special together. I think the casting people are at fault. They didn't make sure the two actors would have that essential on-screen charisma that could give this relationship the poignancy it deserved.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
108,Paddy-49,"A very funny film, with hidden depths",9,4 May 2004,"It is said that if you need to explain a joke then it can no longer be funny. So the compulsion to explain why I think that `Four Weddings and a Funeral' is much more than just a very funny film is rather risky. But I believe that the movie is an example of a work of art that can be enjoyed at many levels. Enjoy it, certainly, as witty, very well acted, moving and engaging. But I would argue that it has a deeper quality  especially its ability to challenge prejudice and its touching belief in the ultimate decentness of people  and in the power of love. Love is the central theme of all three of Richard Curtis's major films (`Four Weddings'; `Notting Hill' and `Love Actually'). Curtis's credo is `amor vincit omnia'  although in ultimately conquering love may slip along the way. In `Four Weddings and a Funeral' the risks to love's happy resolution are all revealed and (mostly) conquered. Shortly before he dies at the Scottish wedding Gareth says `A toast before we go into battle. True love  in whatever shape or form it may come  may we all in our dotage be proud to say I was adored once too'; and Carrie (the bride) quotes John Lennon in her speech - `Love is the answer'.Described in this way the risk of such a critique is that we navigate close to romantic novel territory. But Four Weddings never strays across this sentimental border. The ultimately happy ending (not just for Carrie and Charles but for all the characters in the photo montage over the credits) is only possible for Charles when, having at last declared his love for Carrie `I've loved you from the first second I met you', then asks her if `after we've spent lots of time together you might agreenot to marry me?'. No more weddings  but an agreement to spend the rest of their life together. And so it was (of course) with Gareth and Matthew - the relationship described by Charles at Gareth's funeral as the `perfect match'. Such a match can only be destroyed by death as Matthew acknowledges in his quote from Auden at the funeral `I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong'The connection (or not) between love and sex is also addressed throughout the film. The unspoken sub-text of Carrie's slightly shocking revelation to Charles that she has had thirty-three lovers is that she didn't actually love any of them (including, as it turns out, the one she is about to marry). And Scarlett says `most of the blokes I fancy think I'm stupid and pointless, so they just bonk me and leave me.' Charles is like this in Henrietta's description of him as a `serial monogamist' who will `never really love anyone, because you never let them near you.' Implied strongly here is the modern reality that sex (as an enjoyable pastime) can be decoupled from sex (as an expression of love). There is however the (moral?) suggestion that if you combine love with sex then that will be the best of all worlds. Whilst Bernard and Lydia reach the height of sexual passion together (and Charles crouches in a nearby cupboard) he says `Oh I love my wife' to which she replies `Ilovemyhusband!'The central theme of the film is really that love takes many forms. Platonic (Charles and Scarlett; Tom and his dog Jilly) unrequited (Fiona for Charles); Single sex (Gareth and Matthew); hard work (Shy Serena and deaf David) and (crucially) the love that binds a group of true friends together. The film is not judgemental  other than to expose the crass (George, who asks `what use are the novels of Wordsworth') and the boring (John, the `38 going on 60 stockbroker').That the pursuit of love leaves casualties along the way is an explicit part of the film. Fiona's hopeless love for Charles, Henrietta's rejection by Charles at the altar; the failure of Carrie and Hamish's marriage (despite his confident statement at the wedding that his life with her would be a `joyful one, for years and years to come') are examples. But despite the wounds there is a moral message here as well  that living a lie or deluding yourself that there is love when really it is only lust, or convenience or habit is undesirable. You can be as indecisive as Charles; as dim as Tom; as scatty as Scarlett as randy as Lydia; as intellectually brutal and honest as Fiona  none of this matters if, in the end, your heart rules your head and you allow true love to triumph.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
109,spencer-w-hensley,Wonderful romantic comedy; the last 20 minutes are too slow,8,12 September 2020,"I dont dislike Hugh Grant as an actor. He is a perfectly adequate enough star, but I have found the movies he has been in are not worthy of the talent he has overall. Nine Months for instance is one movie I wish I never would have wasted my time watching. He was ok in a movie called The Rewrite with Marisa Tomei but while watchable it was a pretty overall forgettable flick. Due to the scripts he chooses usually being below average for my tastes, I was not overly enthusiastic about this movie even though it was nominated for Best Picture in a company of powerhouse cinema including no less than Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. To be nominated with those three classics among one of the five best pictures of the year this movie had to do something right so I was willing to give it a chance. What surprised me was just how intelligent the dialogue was. I wasnt expecting this to be that smart of a movie but the screenplay here is razor sharp with very funny gags and dialogue. I was laughing pretty consistently up until the end. Grant gives a very good performance here and it is not hard to see why within a year he became an international star with popularity overseas in the U.S. Andie Madowell is charming and it is easy to see why Grant is mesmerized by her and their chemistry is great. One side splitting cameo comes in the form of Rown Atkinson, known more popularly around the world as Mr. Bean, a student of the priesthood, who eventually officiates a wedding that Grant and MacDowell attend. It's a shame Atkinson didnt have more to do. He steals his big scene and it is among the movies most funny moments. The movie does get a little slow in the last 20 or so minutes and predictable, however with that small reservation this overall is great fun throughout, one of the best rom coms I have seen, certainly Grant's best work that I have seen to date. Definitely a great date night movie that is a very fun ride up until those final 20 minutes.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

His simpering character earns affection and amusement and the plot takes us seamlessly from celebration to consternation. The ""stop the clocks"" poem reading has to be one of the most moving and memorable moments in film history. Addie McDowell is delightful as the American ice-maiden and the rest of the cast just avoid being sterotypes and give splendidly eccentric and witty performances. The script is one of the best both in pace and in humour and makes a search for further Richard Curtis credits on the IMDb essential!",Four Weddings and a Funeral
114,DesbUK,A Gem,8,29 March 2008,"14 years after its release, I watched 'Four Weddings' again on DVD. Perhaps it's a sign of a bona fide classic that on repeated viewings the film - like a vintage wine - improves with age. The Richard Curtis script has not been diminished by numerous knock offs. It's a warm, tender entertainment totally lacking in cynicism.The opening scene sets the original tone. Charles (Hugh Grant), a 30-something Londoner and his semi-punk flat mate Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) are late for a wedding. The first twenty words or so of the film are 'f**k' or variations on the word 'f**k' delivered as an expression of exasperation every time something delays them. Unless you have only seen the film on US TV - I saw it on American TV in 2001 and the 'f**ks' had been replaced by 'buggars', a quintessentially English swear word never used in the USA and therefore inoffensive to American ears.The title is also a full plot summary. The film follows a group of friends through 4 different weddings and the funeral of one of their number. The other friends - Kristen Scott Thomas, John Hannah, James Fleet, Simon Callow - exist only at these glossy straight from the pages of 'Country Life and 'Tatler' weddings. Charles is the principle character, perpetually embarrassed and in love with a Yuppie American Carrie (Andie McDowell). He looses her, sees her married, then when she splits up with her husband, Charles jilts his bride on their wedding day to be with Carrie. And here is the film's main flaw - Carrie is nether especially sensual or interesting. In fact, she's rather flat (imagine what Tracy Ullman or Emma Thompson could have done with the role). Charles turns down the attentions of Kristen Scott Thomas and jilts Anna Chancellor at the altar, both of whom are more attractive than McDowell. But this is a fantasy where love is like a bolt of lighting. Director Mike Newell and writer Richard Curtis turn the English social occasions into self-contained vehicles for farce and romance, notably Rowan Atkinson as nervous, tongue tied novice priest, fumbling and fluffing his way through a wedding service. Most moving of all, John Hannah delivering the eulogy at his boyfriend's funeral (the ebullient Simon Callow, dying of a heart attack) - it's a reading of WH Auden's poem blues that is touching without ever being mawkish.A durable format was created with this film and the English Rom-Com born.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
115,sissoed,Loved Andie McDowell,7,17 March 2007,"Just wanted to add my praise for Andie McDowell's performance, which I found fine, including the very last lines. The criticism of her from other commentators strikes me more as a dislike for the way she and the director chose to portray the character, rather than an inability on her part of playing it in some different way. I also like the way the movie resolves the last wedding, which is very true to the personalities of all the characters and grows naturally from the interaction of all of them, and keeps Hugh Grant's character honorable, though flawed. Clever, unexpected, but true to character. I would give it more stars except that there were a few parts where I felt the movie was a little too contrived to get some laughs.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
116,kickstand,Utterly charming and enjoyable,8,29 January 2000,"This is a joyous, fun and charming film, one of the few romances of the decade that's not insipid or stupid. Certainly superior to the very similar ""Notting Hill,"" with a passel of enjoyable characters well played. The only sour note is McDowell, who's just not as charismatic as required. Perhaps Julia Roberts can be digitally switched from Notting Hill to this movie.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
117,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 3 out of 5,6,20 January 2003,"Four Weddings and a Funeral is an extremely funny film.  If the opening sequence doesn't make you laugh, nothing will.  And conversely, if Matthew's moving rendition of W. H. Auden's ""Stop all the clocks. . ."" poem doesn't leave you close to tears, then you must be truly hard-hearted. Unfortunately though, what could have been an excellent comedy has a major flaw.Charles (Hugh Grant) is a likeable chap whose friends are all getting married, leaving him as a sort of perpetual Best Man.  Then American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) enters the picture and causes Charles to reassess his thoughts on marriage.  Grant has charisma in spades, but sadly MacDowell does not.  In fact, she is perhaps one of the least charismatic actresses ever.  Not only that, but the limit of her acting ability seems to be a toothpaste-advertisement-style smile.  Fortunately the casting of Charles's motley collection of single friends is excellent, and one can't help thinking he would be better off marrying one of them.The film is almost fly-on-the-wall in its style, which gives it realism and allows it to explore the relationships within the group of friends on an intimate and everyday level.  Hence the subtle humour works better than, for example, Rowan Atkinson's very obvious laugh-line attempts as a preacher with a penchant for Spoonerisms.As one character notes, weddings have a habit of blending together in the memory and the director has played on this, creating four weddings that are visually similar and yet distinct.  And of one of them is particularly memorable for the fact that it doesn't actually include a marriage ceremony. At its conclusion the film shows that whilst marriage is a noble institution, it is not for everybody.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

He was only half right: the movie was awful and he was (as always) terrible. The acting was sub-par save Rowan Atkinson in a very, very minor role (only good thing in the film I might add).  The dialogue was also sub-par and down right gratuitous in its vulgarity. Only Pulp Fiction and South Park (as far as I know) use the ""F"" word more often than this film (the entire opening dialogue is nothing but the ""F"" word repeated like 30 or 40 times). My friends and I were keeping count of how many times the word was used just to keep our sanity. The story? (WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD) Like everything else, it was God awful.  Please tell me I didn't just waste 117 minutes of my life just to hear Hugh Grant's character go up to the woman he loves, tell her that he loves her, but I can't marry you so lets just live together...AND SHE IS OK WITH THIS!?!?

120,last-picture-show,Wet Wet Wet's Love Is All Around - not actually in the movie?,8,26 January 2007,"I didn't get round to seeing this movie until about 3 or 4 months after it was released, by which time the song from the film (Love Is All Around, performed by Wet Wet Wet) had been at the top of the charts for fifteen weeks until I understand the band requested that their record company deleted the single because they had had enough of performing it and promoting it. I had assumed that because of the longevity of the song in the pop charts, and because of all the tremendous hype surrounding the song, that the it would play a significant part in the story. However I was totally surprised to see that the Wet Wet Wet song isn't used anywhere in the movie at all! I watched it all the way through (and enjoyed it very much) but I keeped waiting for the familiar strains of Marti Pellow's voice signing THAT song but it never came. The nearest we got was an amateur version sung at one of the weddings by a cabaret band but it was not the Wet Wet Wet version. I was about to leave the cinema when right at the end of the end title sequence it suddenly faded in after Elton John's cover of Going To The Chapel. Am I missing something here? Is it really possible that the record-buying public took this song to their hearts (making it the biggest-selling single of all time) and associated it with the movie on the strength of it being very clumsily spliced on the end of the end titles? Incredible! It's almost as though the producers needed a last song to include on the soundtrack album to make up the numbers, or they realised that there weren't enough ballads in the soundtrack of what was obviously a love story and so persuaded Wet Wet Wet to record it and then spliced it onto the titles almost as an afterthought because there was nowhere else for it to go. If this is true then I suppose it shows how powerful the movie was because cinema audiences obviously must have stayed to watch it to the very end of the end titles (which is unusual), and so caught THE song. But perhaps what is even more odd is that after the huge success of the song the director wasn't tempted to re-edit the movie to include at lease a snatch of the Wet Wet Wet song at some significant point. As the song says - 'Come on and let it show'.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

122,angry127,Marriage,6,9 January 2011,"This film reminds me of a song I once wrote. It only had one word as the lyrics and that word was the same as the title, ""Marijuana."" The word was purposely pronounced incorrectly to sound like ""Marriage you wanna?"". The idea of the song was to take a swipe at marriage by comparing it to the quick high and long thereafter of a good toke. This film seems to take the same opinion on the subject.We see the silly celebrations taking place in an attempt at formality. Usually something goes wrong or something embarrassing happens at the time. This leaves a kind of skepticism about the holiness and correctness of marriage. This idea comes out more firmly when the main character asks his love to not marry him under and circumstances. She ironically replies, ""I do"".The film has some funny scenes in it, and it was quite watchable.

124,yaseminturkish,A British masterpiece that proves that Hugh Grant is the best at playing the romantic hero,9,18 April 2002,"A movie meant for all of the Americans who are tired of seeing a romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts or an action flick with Bruce Willis, Four Wedding's and a Funeral brings back my nostalgia for British comedy. Reminding me of those delightful BBC sitcoms Faulty Towers, Fine Romance, and As Time Goes By this film enchants on all levels and shows a British perspective on the oh so tired romantic comedy genre. 
  Hugh Grant is at his finest in the role as the romantic lead and Andie McDowell delights as his American love interest Carrie.  Hugh Grant may have run into the problem of typecasting himself for an eternity as the romantic hero but who can fault him for that?  His amazing eyes and playboy hair make him perfect for these roles and I'd rather fall in love anyday with Hugh Grant than that American romantic zero Tom Hanks in Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail.  Andie McDowell also has good chemistry with Grant and proves that Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and Notting Hill is nothing more than a name that somehow merits big paychecks.  Her Carrie is a fairly quiet but obviously intelligent and witty woman who knows what she wants and goes after it.    Four Weddings and a Funeral is truly the first romantic epic since the over-rated Doctor Zhivago and you get the feeling that the makers of the film could have stretched out the fun at least a half-hour more.  There is never a dull moment and it remains a fun foreign flick without the sub-titles that typically annoy.  And if you need ideas for your wedding day there are all of four weddings to help you choose a dress and food for the reception.  Rent this with your husband!  9/10 (The Best Romantic Comedy Ever)",Four Weddings and a Funeral
125,jusco15,jusco's review: Four Weddings and a Funeral,7,2 January 2011,"This delightful British romantic comedy kicked off Hugh Grant's career and rightfully so. There's something about him that is highly enjoyable to watch; we laugh at his witty remarks, we cringe when he is clumsy and makes stupid mistakes, we are happy for him when he finds true love. Sure, it's formulaic as evidenced in his later films; Notting Hill, About A Boy, Love Actually, just to name a few. But he is the master of playing romcom leads, and it's a wickedly pleasant indulgence to watch him in action. In Four Weddings and a Funeral, he charms both the audience and an American lady he meets at a wedding (the first of four), and we follow his exploits in attempting to win her over, amidst a hilarious bunch of friends and another suitor.This is a comedy that is actually funny, with plenty of smart dialogue to laugh at. Granted, it is all Richard Curtis' doing (the master of comedic writing: check Blackadder, Mr. Bean, The Vicar of Dibley), but the cast does deliver it spot on. Special mentions goes to Simon Callow and David Haig for playing two of Hugh Grant's friends, Charlotte Coleman for playing his flatmate and Rowan Atkinson, as always, steals the show with a brief but hilarious scene as a priest-in-learning. Andie MacDowell is sweet and will steal anyone's heart with her portrayal of Hugh Grant's love interest. A solid, well-picked cast.Despite an overall light-hearted tone, there is one particularly emotional scene that is both tragic and moving, and features the beautiful poem, Funeral Blues, by W.H. Auden. It is in this scene where Four Weddings and a Funeral proves itself as not just your typical romcom, but is deeply layered and even meaningful. The mood switches from happy and carefree, to solemn and heartbreaking, to happy once again. It's the perfect feel-good formula that will get you smiling and this is one romantic comedy that manages to pull it off extremely well.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

This movie illustrates a perfection in social ordering (as many movies do) - the most beautiful pair off with the most beautiful, the idiosyncratic with the odd, the conventional with the conventional - a pre-determined social order decreed by romantic infatuation.Also, there are some huge plot holes in this movie, the biggest is Hugh Grant's sudden relationship with his bride-to-be.

But ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" have proved me wrong on that one. Perhaps its the British brand of comedy that I just couldn't associate with but I've never been more literal when I say that I didn't laugh ONCE at anything that happened in this movie.Basically, the movie is about Huge Grant's character Charles and his relationship with women, mostly a woman he keeps bumping into at weddings. Even though it is a ""romantic comedy"" I found it a little ridiculous at how romanticized it was that all these characters kept meeting each other and then almost instantly falling in love with one another. That also lead to a sort of moral ambiguity. The two main characters sleep with each other the night they meet. He's been the heart breaker in a lot of failed relationship and she cheats on her finance and then divorces him shortly after the marriage (Big surprise!) and these are supposed to be the ""charming"" characters we're meant to root for and associate with?

But The first groan has to come when Hugh Grant starts talking, properly talking. He can act up to a point can't he? But he only really knows one character. Yes, he's good at smiling, brushing back his hair and laughing nervously but not much else. If what your looking for is a typical Grant character you won't be disappointed.but i'm afraid i started to lose interest when he started falling for McDowell's character who's name i can't remember. The whole thing goes downhill from there as you start to wonder what the point is, we all know he'll end up with her in the end which is something you can only groan at so why bother seeing it through.I wanted to know who was going to die but after that i thought i'd probably switch over. I was disappointed when it turned out to be Callow whose character i'd actually taken quite a liking to. But i had to watch it to the end anyway, I wanted to see what became of some of the minor and far more likable characters.I was quite please when he was about to marry that weird one whose name i also can't remember. Then McDowell turns up at his wedding to take him away, evil!!! How can he like her? why??? She's just... evil! The ending was everything i expected and less. Less because of that awful line i used in the title. Who wouldn't cringe at that?

So why do we want them to get together?

I remain irritated at the strangely callous and bewildering behavior of ""Carrie"" who seems to enjoy sleeping around quite a lot without a regret despite her perfect lady image, and even after becoming engaged. And why did she become engaged to that older man if not just as a gold digger although she pretends to love him? It doesn't bode well for a future with her. The rest of the characters are sheer perfection, bumbling but sweet Charles, the wealthy brother-sister, the quirky short-hair girl roommate, Gareth chortling loudly and dancing wildly etc. etc. Interestingly I saw more funny moments this time that I had missed before, including the elderly lady passed out on the church steps after one of the weddings. There are a few classic scenes that I never stop laughing at. My favorite is the tear down the highway to the first wedding, with them swearing constantly then backing up in the mini to make the exit. Another is where Charles has to wait in the sink cupboard for Lydia and Bernard to stop wildly making love. Another one, the scene where Charles and his friend run madly once again to another wedding and the short-haired gal puts on the fake hair piece and then walks up the aisle with her knickers on display through the ripped dress....utterly hilarious. Along the way are some poignant moments as when Charles talks to his friend about why they are never the ones getting married and the wealthy friend says he just hopes to find a nice girl who doesn't get sick at the look of him and settle down together, ""worked for my parents, aside from the divorce and all"". Funny but sad at the same time.

She arrived with Hugh Grant on her arm, and was wearing a black dress which seemed to be tied together with safety pins. When she turned sideways, she looked almost naked.The reason I mention this is because the dress drew more attention than the film, and anyone who bothered to see it (the film, that is) would understand why.As Bob Hope once memorably said, 'There'll always be an England - even if it's in Hollywood.' Therein lies the problem of this picture.It is so desperate to be liked by American audiences it turns its core subjects into stereotypes in order to pander to the overseas image of the British upper class twit.I'm only surprised that they didn't bother filming the entire picture within the confines of Buckingham Palace, that way even Prince Charles might have got a walk-on part and a few lines.

The structuring of the film is terrific--we really never know the characters outside of the various weddings and funerals they attend.  The casting is wonderful--Hugh Grant is obviously the star, but each character is fully fleshed out and so interesting!  Kristin Scott Thomas is particularly impressive as the icy, brokenhearted Fiona who has so many hidden secrets.  The actors playing the gay couple are wonderful in the subtle way the relationship is handled, and Matthew's speech at the funeral leaves me in tears every day.  This film has it all--sadness at Gareth's funeral, the torment of a broken heart, the joy of a wedding, and some absolutely hilarious scenes!  Even after seeing it so many times, I cannot stop laughing in the scenes where Hugh gets stuck in the closet while the bride and groom are ""celebrating"" their marriage, or where he is stuck at the table with all his old girlfriends, or where the vicar performs his first wedding ceremony.  It's hilarious without relying on stupid sight gags, obvious jokes, or other conventional movie cliches.I know a lot of people may not agree with me, but I find this movie to be so completely entertaining that it amazes me.  It's greatness lies in the individual scenes and the inclusion of sideplots in addition to the main romance between Charles and Carrie.  I swear, every time I see it I find something else that I love about it.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a subtle comedy (but be prepared to rewind it in several places to get a grasp on the British accents).10 out of 10.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

I remember when it was in the cinemas and we couldn't get in to watch it as all seats were taken. We tried for a few weeks eventually saw it. I remember coming out from the cinema just happy and chatting about it. To me, that's how I review a film.I love all the characters - Charles with his lateness and his fu***ty fu**s, are hilarious. The love story along with the weddings and funeral (how moving to see Gareth's background and his parents looking unbelievable at what has happened). The Funeral Blues poem has always been one of my favourites and it fitted well here.There are so many funny, laugh out loud scenes and I love the scene outside a church when one of their friends says 'shame there was no stag party', and Charles, surprised, responds we did............then sees his friend's (John Hannah) head shaking from side to side and realises he needs to change this to ...........we did, we did, we didn't have a stag party (and gives a reason).

All the other characters were flawed, but likable. Carrie was unendurable.I wonder how many people overcame their dismay at the end of this movie by realizing that Charles marries Fiona after Carrie dumps him. On the other hand, this may not be supposed to be a ""happy ever after movie,"" since commitment-phobic Charles marries emotionally dead Carrie and so remains ""uncommitted."" McDowell may be cut some slack for her wooden performance because of a lack of preparation and perhaps the people responsible for this movie realized her behavior was that of a high functioning person with autism.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
140,pratyush-03848,It has you smiling all the way,9,28 March 2017,"Four Weddings and a Funeral tells the story of Charles (Hugh Grant) who is a bachelor and attends weddings, usually arriving late. In one such wedding he comes across Carrie (Andie McDowell) and is taken away. They later spend the night together but move on. Later on the meet each other in other weddings and a funeral, hence the title Four Weddings and a Funeral. Along the way, we come across Charles' friends who are also single and looking for love. As the film progresses, we see how each friend finds romance in some person even if they met for a short period of time. Charles' friends also help him in trying to falling in love with Carrie. Will Charles and Carrie end up together? What happens to each of Charles' friends? These questions form the rest of the plot of Four Weddings and a Funeral.Hugh Grant again shows why he is one of the greatest Rom-Com actors of his generation. I don't think I have seen an actor that has dominated the genre as he has in recent memory. Andie MacDowell is a good support to the cast but her performance was quite wooden. For example in the rain scene, (SPOILER ALERT!) she did not show a whole lot of emotion in such a pivotal scene. The standout in Charles' friends is Gareth played by Simon Callow. He is the jovial one of the group and gives the best advice to all the friends. But if there is one performance that I remember the most, it would have to be Rowan Atkinson as the newly ordained but bumbling Father Gerald. His short performance reminded me of the priest in The Princess Bride, except he can pronounce the words, but says the wrong words.All in all, despite a slightly wooden performance by Andie MacDowell, Four Weddings and a Funeral is a great comedy for all. From start to finish, you will find yourself cheering on Charles and his friends in their quest for love. Don't miss it.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

A wanting to be nice romantic story mixed in a ghastly english idea of humor made out of even more ghastly english jokes based on vulgarities and sex obsession spelled out by mostly ugly people. Really painful...
3 stars instead of one. One for Andie McDowell (she has a nice smile but a poore performance) and one for Hugh Grant (though I wonder how much he got paid to take part in this...and for using the f... word so many times that I thought is the only word he knows).

142,teacherlogan,"Enduring Friendship. Pure, simple and very funny",9,7 February 2008,"Four Wedding and a Funeral is a fabulous movie even if you hate weddings, funerals or love stories. The film is about friendship, something we can all relate to with fondness. The movie follows seven friends as they experience love and loss, rejection and resolve. But, instead of a British pub, the setting is an English church or a Scottish castle. The film reminds us of the value of having supporting people in our lives. The joy, sadness and general awkwardness each character endures is magnified by these good friends being together through it all. Four Weddings and A Funeral makes us yearn for such relationships in our own lives as we laugh with our new friends on screen.Charles is the ring leader of this band of serial wedding guests. He is always going to weddings but fearful of any sort of commitment. With a charming smile and debonair wit, he can enchant women but has no intention of settling down. He is in awe of those who commit to marriage but freely admits that he could never take such a dramatic step.Until he meets Carrie. Carrie is an American who is experienced in love. She is care-free. And she is intoxicating. Charles is drawn to her, like a moth to a flame. It is certainly love at first sight. Unfortunately, opportunities to meet are few and far between. The few social settings alluded by the title are their only chance for interaction. After meeting at the first wedding, Carrie attends the second engaged. Will Charles' first true love be unattainable?For some reason, Hugh Grant's bumbling English charm rubs a large portion of movie goers the wrong way. His acting can be one dimensional. Grant's characters contain many of the same quirks and mannerisms regardless of the film. Call it being type cast, pigeon holed, what have you. At times, it is hard to argue with this reputation.But some of his films are far better than others. Four Weddings and A Funeral and Notting Hill are among his finest films. Is his character any different? Not really. But his surrounding cast is. Grant's greatest films surround his clumsy act with a colorful array of supporting characters. With their own distinct idiosyncrasies, Grant's cast makes his faults less demonstrative, less outrageous and part of a delightful hodge-podge of screen chemistry. Alone Hugh Grant cannot carry a movie. But as part of the whole, his persona can play against four or five equally engaging characters with magnificent results.Four Weddings and A Funeral works because the camaraderie displayed by the seven friends seems absolutely genuine. Screen chemistry is often used as a buzz word for any successful character driven film. But more than others, Four Weddings and A Funeral relies on this chemistry as the basis for the entire film. The audience must believe that these characters truly enjoy each other's company. It takes more than simply great acting. Script and direction must also accentuate the theme of friendship. The bond shared by the characters must permeate every aspect of the film. Four Weddings and A Funeral succeeds brilliantly. The audience is seamlessly drawn into the friends' inner circle. It happens so fast that it seems an effortless process. Before the first reception is over, we have a perfect understanding of each of the seven friends. Each is unique and compelling. The same appeal that has drawn them to each other draws them to us. As an American outsider and the object of Charles' affection, Carrie becomes a threat to the group. A group of which we have quickly become a part. We all long for substantial relationships in our lives. Whether romantic or platonic, dependable relationships make life wonderful or bearable. The good times become great; the bad times are a little bit easier to handle. Four Weddings and A Funeral is more than a romantic comedy. Too many romantic comedies involve a boy, a girl and little else. Four Weddings and A Funeral gives us a group of friends who are looking for love. We join their struggle, celebrate their triumphs and share their pain. Four Weddings and A Funeral draws us in as few films can.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

144,seamysmama,A familiar movie for a rainy day.....,8,12 February 2019,"First off, I love this movie. When it happens to come on tv, or recently, available again on a premium channel, I will watch it. You've watched it before, you'll watch it again, and it's a comfortable, sentimental movie. From that point of view, I cannot fault it. Like many movies you haven't seen for several years, but then creep back into your life, you start to notice different things and see situations from a different perspective. And that brings me to the character of Carrie. What a horrible person! She hooks up with Charlie, and that's fine enough, but it clearly means more to Charile, and then Carrie is off to America. The 2 run into each other again at another wedding. Charlie is excited to see her again, but she has brought her much older fiance to the event, putting a damper on Charlie's plans to reunite. But wait! The fiancee goes back to Scotland again, and Carrie makes herself available to Charlie that same night, further stringing him along with no hope of a relationship because she's engaged to someone else! Further down the road, the two cross paths again, and she takes Charlie wedding dress shopping of all God-forsaken things, while regaling him with tales of all the men she's slept with. When he tells her, awkwardly, that he loves her, she WALKS AWAY! She then marries the old Scot, and Charlie comes to the wedding so he can continue to torture himself, pining away for the love he cannot have. When he himself decides to settle for a past girlfriend he doesn't really love, Carrie shows up to his wedding with the news she has separated from her husband (after less than a year of marriage), so the tortured Charlie calls off his wedding in the middle of the ceremony so he can finally be with the love of his life, a manipulative woman who clearly can't be trusted with his feelings. Why did I root for these two to get together all those years ago? He should have ran screaming in the opposite direction by the time she took him dress shopping to marry someone else. Other than that......the funeral scene still makes me cry buckets, and I will still watch this movie because I love it, but now I see Carrie for what she really is.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
145,delisay_im,Superb screen writing - very intelligent and very funny,10,30 August 2006,"For me this is a cinematic masterpiece. It oozes intelligence - the elegant script, very well formed characters, some exceptional casting (except for ""the American"" - oops!), and all stitched together with remarkable skill by the director and production team. It will stand out forever as a true classic.Just as important is that it's incredibly funny, especially if you are British or close to someone who is. The humour is so genuine, so warm-hearted, so silly, so very...British. And there's lots of it, all the way up to and including the credits.The setting is somewhat upper class (but not entirely), so panders to the stereotype. (If something is true, is it still a 'stereotype'?) But I loved that this provided a platform for intelligent dialogue - plenty of social insights to take home, and not a trace of dumbing down for 'lowest common denominator' audiences.This is a very re-watchable movie. There's such rich content and so much humour that it's still very entertaining on the third or fourth viewing. Thoroughly endearing, remarkably brilliant movie-making.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

The main characters are terrible people.A grab bag group of friends keep getting invited to weddings. Best man, Charles (Grant) is blundering and irresponsible. He meets a beautiful American Carrie (Macdowel) at the wedding and is immediately smitten. Can't take his eyes off her all night. She seems to like him too. They awkwardly flirt then sleep together. In the morning she makes an odd comment that they're engaged because they slept together. He's weirded out then realizes she's joking. Then she leaves for America. She says they're a missed opportunity.
A few months later at another wedding Carrie comes up to Charles to say hello. Charles is ecstatic to see her! Then she introduces him to her much older, very rich, fiance. Charles is terribly disappointed. He also gets seated at a table with all his ex girlfriends. They tease him and we learn he's, apparently, quite the ladie's man, heartbreaker, and super bachelor. (Really? All we've seen him be is bumbling. Not smooth or desirable) One of his exes gets drunk and cries all over him. Meanwhile he's still desperately pining for Carrie. Carrie puts her fiancé in a cab and sends him home. Then she asks Charles for a night cap. They sleep together again. Then they go shopping for her wedding dress and she tells him about all the men she's slept with. Then he tells her that he loves her. She says he's lovely.
Charles and his friends go to Carrie's wedding. One friend confesses her love to Charles. Another friend has a heart attack and dies. Another friend tells Charles that love at first sight probably isn't a thing and that meeting someone nice, settling down, and getting married is a good thing.
Months later it's Charles's wedding. He is marrying that drunk ex girlfriend who nobody likes. Then Carrie shows up at his wedding. She and her geezer husband have decided to divorce. Charles asks why she didn't contact him sooner. She mumbles some excuse that she wasn't in a good state. Charles is conflicted. He loves Carrie but it's his wedding day. His deaf brother steps in during ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" and the marriage is stopped.
Carrie goes to Charles's house to check on him. Apologizes for coming to his wedding. Charles gives her a non marriage proprosal, because marriage isn't his thing. She is the first woman he has loved with all his heart. They kiss, nonverbally accepting his non proprosal.

160,swansong-2,"Lovely, simply lovely",10,29 September 1999,"This has become my all-time favourite romantic comedy, beating out even ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  The script is wonderfully witty and all of the actors (Andie MacDowell excluded) are a joy to watch.  MacDowell seems incredibly out of place here, however, and I believe that her part could have been portrayed much better.  Hers was the only character that I had a difficult time empathizing in any way with, although I tried.  She seems very stand-offish, and almost sleepwalks throughout the movie.  Hugh Grant, on the other hand, plays this role so naturally, I wouldn't be surprised if he was just playing himself (and from what I've read, he probably was). The true kudos for this movie, however, belongs to the scriptwriter, who had the presence of mind to include a deaf character who actually contributes something to the movie other than a ""humorous"" minority.  David is a true, natural character, who has the ability to love, laugh, joke, and express himself without needing some stupid sight gag, like having him walk into a bus because he can't hear the horn or something.  You actually care about this character.  ""Ahem""  Hollywood scriptwriters, please take note!!!The true gem of this movie for me had to be Simon Callow as Gareth. Rarely have I fallen in love with a character because of his love for life, his zest, his wit, and his hidden tender side (it seems hardly beside the point that his relationship is homosexual, and it works beautifully), rather than his chiselled good looks and muscular chest.  How refreshing that a character such as Gareth could be so wonderfully played, when it could have so easily been turned into a campy, ridiculous charicature by many of the popular actors churning out movies today!  Enjoyable to the very last scene, I laughed out loud (rare for me, especially when watching a show alone), I cried, I fell in love, and every time I watch this movie, I want to embrace my husband and never let him go.Watch this movie, and you'll fall in love all over again.

However, after watching the movie, I was quite disappointed. I couldn't pinpoint what it was about the movie that left me disappointed, but now I realized it was Andie MacDowell's performance. I didn't feel anything for her other than she was simply unlikable and dull. Don't get me wrong, rom-coms aren't meant to be realistic, but I thought it was SO wrong for both Carrie to attend the wedding and basically ruin Charles's day by telling him that she and her husband were separating AND for Charles to leave Henrietta like that on her wedding day.

It does not do justice to the romantic genre that is overshadowed by the scant importance given by the main characters to how they affects the other characters with their actions. It seems they want to show as something romantic, which in real life could be seen as a way of acting irresponsibly towards the feelings of others. Not a good example of romanticism.

The dialogue is sharp and funny, the various characters are on the whole realistic and interesting (Andie McDowell's is the weakest), and the story works well as a simple vehicle for the characters to reveal themselves in. The pathetic attempt to do a sequel (Notting Hill - gimme a break!) pales in comparison to this movie. The two gay characters are especially well done; no-one notices they are gay until the funeral.

There's the charming Charles, and his American love interest Carrie; there's Micheal and Gareth, the gay couple that are polar opposites of each other, but love each other all the same; there's the social boob Tom, and his sister the lovely Fiona, and an assortment of other interesting and charming characters. Rowan Atkinson has a hilarious cameo in it as well, as the incompetent priest. If there was one thing that I would change, it would be the Carrie character. Warning: she has a monotone which gets seriously annoying after a while, but is a beautiful and good actress nonetheless.

I love Charles mistakes when he tells John the rumour of another man and John's wife.

I had a few laughs, mostly in the beginning, but roughly halfway through the movie I felt humor has worn out. I found it difficult to empathize the characters, any of them, in fact. What's that thing with getting a kick out of someone else's embarrassment? Dry humor, you call it? Andy McDowell didn't look charming at all. She was much more believable in ""Groundhog Day"". Maybe playing ""sluts"" (as she was rightfully labeled by one of the characters in the movie) isn't her thing after all.Now don't take me wrong. It could very well be that the problem is with me, not the movie.

171,sophieahmed,Creme de la creme of romantic comedies,10,23 August 2015,"Four Weddings has achieved iconic status as a British film and for good reasons. It comes under the category of a romantic comedy but I would argue that it is in fact far more than that. It is a film about love in all its myriad and astonishing aspects - love between man and woman, or between 2 men, love between mother and child and longstanding friendship which can be much more important than sexual love. You would need a heart of stone not to cry at the funeral scene. The film is beautiful to look at with the contrasting weddings and gorgeous costumes. It is directed with a very light touch and interweaves the main characters in an ingenious way. The acting is generally superb and without a doubt it is Hugh Grant's greatest role - before he became middle aged and cynical. My only objection is that Andie McDowell was a very odd choice for the role, not very beautiful and not a serious actress. Apart from that, the film is perfect in every respect and I could watch it forever.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

173,wcgreen-65865,An utter waste of time,1,31 December 2017,"I watched this movie on TV against my better judgement (I admittedly dislike chick flicks and anything with Hugh Grant) because it had received so much critical acclaim. Just goes to show, critics cannot be trusted. In a word, it was pure drivel. Unless you are a hopelessly masochistic romantic, avoid this movie at all costs. But IMDB requires more words so I will go into more detail. 
For starters, the entire story line makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Why are all these people waking up so early in the morning to attend so many weddings and ALWAYS together? And why do they continue to trust Hugh Grant's character.. who is obviously an imbecile.. to deliver the wedding rings each time? Why do Charles and Scarlett live together... are they siblings or simply roommates? Why do they all ride in formal attire to weddings together in an old beat-up Range Rover? Why does Charles almost marry a woman he dislikes so intensely? 
The questions just keep coming with no legitimate answers. 
I really hoped this would be a good movie that would change my attitude towards chick flicks but instead it confirmed it. 
But the real question is why did so many people give this movie a good review? I can only guess they are living in some La-la land where life always has a happy ending.

It would take a long time to list all the things I hated about this film, so here are just a handful:The scene where Andi McDowell lists all 30 men she's slept with in order. As if anyone would remember thirty names in the right order off the top of their head. Every scene with Andi McDowell (a producer's decision to appeal to US as well as UK markets?) but especially the one during the downpour when Hugh Grant says they should get out of the rain, and she goes 'is it raining? I hadn't noticed,' such is the power of Hugh's love. Even the rest of the cinema audience (who for some reason seemed to love the film,) made a loud collective groan at this line.The clichéd British stereotyping.Hugh Grant in particular. Rowan Atkinson's 'Holy Goat' and 'awful wedded wife' jokes. Last time I heard those I fell off my dinosaur. The scene where Hugh tells the guy how lucky he was to have split with his wife because everyone knew she used to sleep around, only (wait for it) the guy didn't know! How funny is that! Bumbling lovable Hugh puts his foot in it again and can stutter some more. The deaf brother. Completely irrelevant to the plot, except that it he helps prove that despite his philandering ways deep down Hugh must be a good chap because he has a deaf brother and knows signing. Also because having a deaf character is one of many right-on/politically correct boxes this film seems so desperate to tick. Others include the fact that that Andi McDowell has slept with 30 men (because hey, why shouldn't a woman be able to sleep around too?) that Hugh shares a room with a girl (because hey, why can't a guy and a girl share a room without having to have sex with each other?) and that they realise eventually that the gay couple were as committed as any of them (because hey, not all gay people sleep around you know.)Oh yeah and despite the endless Time Out-friendly politics, the film still manages to remain resolutely conservative throughout in its underlying message, namely that marriage (or at least settling down) is the surest way to find lasting happiness. Not one character questions the institution in the whole film. Hugh may be afraid of commitment, but he isn't against marriage as such, and you feel sure the gay characters would have got married if they could have done. Even at the end we are told that Hugh's quirky but nice flatmate got married eventually. Thank God, or she might have ended up a spinster!",Four Weddings and a Funeral

You will be left smiling after this movie.It is genuinely witty and at times touching. If you are anything like me you won't be able to wipe the smile off your face after it.
Firstly, it's worth noting that in 1994 we were yet to see the bumbling, handsome, characteristic Hugh Grant. He is a revelation.
The script is brilliant. Genuinely laugh out loud funny, tight, intelligent. Classic Richard Curtis. It is easy to imagine many of us being in a similar predicament. Twenty something, we're forced to attend wedding after wedding during the summer months. Perhaps more of a chore than something we genuinely want to do... Some of the gags reflect how tedious weddings can be. The jokes/dialogue are even a touch risque but genuinely humourous.
So the script is good. The acting, for the most part great. The only exception is Andy McDowell. She really is a duck out of water in this film. It's hard to know whether she has been miscast or just not a great actress. The only sccen where she seems comfortable is where she reels off all of her 32 lovers. For the rest it's overacting or underacting. I'm not expert enough to know.
One scene that is particularly good follows the death of the charasmatic Gareth (Simon Callow) and the eulogy by the character played by John Hannah. Reciting the amazing poem of WH Auden, it is hard not to feel emotionally connected.
""He was my North, my South, my East and West,
My working week and my Sunday rest,
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;

The truth is far from it, I think in term of romance film Four Weddings and a Funeral could be considered one of the best. It was unique, it was groundbreaking, it was entertaining and funny, it has amazing acting, amazing characters, and amazing chemistry between the characters. All combined result in an amazingly charming romance flick to be enjoyed by all, except for the ending.But of course, for every good thing that this movie has done, they have to ruin it with the most undeserving of a happy ending. The ending felt forced and out of place to the tone of the movie and it felt like the director was forced to put that ending because, well at that time the perfect happy ending where everybody lives happily ever after is the go-to for romantic movies.So, with that said, I do recommend this movie for you to watch.

Here there is no ridicule, no absurdities, just acute, humane and forgiving observation of the humour in situations arising in normal interactions - sometimes embarrassing, sometimes frivolous, sometimes tender.I always find it a pleasure to discover, at a second viewing, elements that one could not have spotted first time around because they are logically connected to something that becomes clear only later. To me it is a sign of intelligence of the director. This movie is full of such moments: looks, movements and words one can really appreciate only the second or third time around.My favourite moment: Charles saying ""odd decision"" to himself after having made a spur-of-the-moment choice that indeed turns out to change his life. Everyone, I think, has encountered such moments which afterwards appear to have been life-changing but are essentially arbitrary, only partially rational choices.The end of the movie isn't the strongest part, in particular Carry's ""is it still raining? I hadn't noticed"" doesn't ring true. I now tend to switch off after Helen knocks Charles out.Curtis played on the success of this movie a lot, but nothing comes close to the original.

197,davewomble,Subtle genius.,10,27 October 2001,"I'm surprised that so many comments have written off this classic British film as either boring or over-rated.  Possibly the subtle humour and romance of this film have been missed by an audience for whom the film wasn't really written.  The difference between Four Weddings and the next Curtis/Grant collaboration, Notting Hill, is that whilst the latter was clearly made with a transatlantic audience in mind, this film is English through and through.
It's brilliance lies mostly in it's throw-away humour, rather than big one-liners.  Some have remarked that the only good bit is Rowan Atkinson as a Mr Bean-esque catholic priest, but his brief scene seems plucked from another movie, and is from a wholly different British school of comedy. This film succeeds by (mostly) staying away from the carry-on tradition of bawdy farce, and instead following a more realistic well-rounded path.  It is true that the setting is not the England of the masses, but then one of Charles's friends is introduced early on as the seventh richest man in the country, so that is fair enough, especially since most modern British films seem to be set in northern mining villages or on rundown council estates!Yes, McDowell doesn't have much to do except look pretty in a hat; and yes, Hugh Grant plays himself - but both fit their parts perfectly, so fair play to the casting director.  Apart from that all the characters in a fine support ensemble are well drawn and believable, without ever detracting from a wonderful central romance.If you want brash humour, you won't find it.  Neither will you find gritty social realism.  But if you want a well written, understated romantic comedy of the highest class, look no further - you've found your perfect match.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

And not at all because it was too sappy, which many romantic comedies are, but because of its lack of any sort of real romance. Of course Hugh Grant was wonderfully funny, but his leading lady, the actress that played his love interest Carrie desperately lacked in depth-showing absolutely no substance or emotion in her role. I hated her character (perhaps more than any other character) in how she seemed fickle in her approach towards men and life, and in the way she toyed with Charley's heart throughout the entire movie-disgarding him casually everytime. But of course Charley's character was more the fool at the end. The comedy though was enjoyable and the interesting mix of characters made it even more funny. I wonder though, of course whether or not Carrie ever did love Charley or just need desperatly to get married to someone that loved her. The movie's portrayal of marriage seemed a big joke- either as a commodity or a stepping stone in life to get over with- if that was intentional they did a good job.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

The main characters were absolute prats, though, and deserved each other (and I don't mean that in a good way!).They both toy with each other and other people in their lives until they - predictably - end up together, but not before hurting just one more person.I mean, Carrie knew what she was doing when she came to his wedding, and told him ON HIS WEDDING MORNING that she was separated. She knew he loved her, and now that she was alone (without her gold mine husband), she didn't want to lose him, but of course, his wedding day was the perfect time to tell him she was available... *roll eyes* SMH for that. She also cheated on her fiancé with him... and he went along with it!What's more, he stood up his bride to be on the wedding day AT THE ALTAR just because Carrie shows up!

202,elise-acker-637-231709,Four Weddings and a Funeral: And Only That,4,19 March 2013,"While I enjoy romantic comedies as much as or more than most, I found very little to appreciate in Four Weddings and a Funeral: It flits around from wedding to wedding employing a fairly large cast of characters, which, though interesting, the viewer never gets to know.The fatal flaw of Four Weddings is that it tells us about many significant friendships, relationships, and romances but rarely shows them to us in actual character interactions or dialogue. The supposedly deep and meaningful connections between characters were actually so threadbare as to cause audience confusion or worse, indifference.Here are a few examples: Charles and Fiona- We learn that they are long-time friends, but see her carp at Charles for his lateness and then confess her love for him, which is never mentioned again hereafter. Carrie and Hamish- She's flirting with Charles, in bed with him and then  engaged to Hamish. Things like this do happen, but she goes out especially with Charles for a fun, ""dress-selecting"" outing and then sleeps with him again before her wedding. This is the marriage that came from nowhere and made no sense other than a (poor) plot device. Gareth- He wears a silly-looking vest but makes fun of Scarlett's dress. He generally has a good time, drinks, dances, and then drops dead in a startling and therefore moderately comical manner. However, his funeral is treated seriously in the film and is supposed to carry great emotional weight with the viewer. Honestly, I barely had time to learn his name and a few superficial facts about him, but there was not enough ""meat"" in his character development to make my eyes even begin to grow misty when he died. Charles and Henrietta- They have a couple of tearful conversations, one complete with a dressing down, no steamy encounters, but suddenly, they're walking down the aisleBut all of this may have been forgivable if the movie had spent any time with the side characters before bombarding us with the montage of weddings at the end. Henrietta/ ""Duckface"" gets married, happily, it seems, but the audience gets not one minute with her after Charles leaves her at the altar.This film skips over almost every relationship or character development worth showing, leaving it emotionally hollow, frustrating, and ultimately forgettable.I guess screenwriter Richard Curtis was getting warmed up for Love Actually, which succeeds in all the ways that Four Weddings and a Funeral failed.",Four Weddings and a Funeral

204,12dq35zx,One of the absolute best comedies in recent years,9,16 August 2005,"""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" is one of the absolute best comedies in recent years. I do not have it on DVD but every time it appears on one of the TV channels you know where to find me. The story is well thought out and it is supported by a very talented cast of characters. Hugh Grant is absolutely fantastic in his leading role as the (almost) eternal bachelor Charles. His interaction with all the supporting characters, Tom, Fiona, Henrietta, David etc is outstanding. He falls short only when it comes to his relationship with the leading female actor, Andie McDowell, as Carrie. Although it is very difficult to tell how love strikes in real life, usually the make-believe world of Hollywood and elsewhere is more predictable. Carrie and Charlie may well have fallen for each other in real life but in the film setting they are not really convincing as lovers. This is a blurp in an otherwise great film with star performances by actors like Kristin Scott Thomas as Fiona, James Fleet as Tom, Simon Callow as Gareth, and not least John Hannah as Matthew. The most heart-gripping scene in the entire film is John Hannah's recital of W.H. Auden's poem ""Stop All The Clocks"" at Gareth's funeral. It provides the necessary balance to all the funny scenes throughout the film. This balance is also visually supported by the choice of location, a grey, rainy Inverness in Scotland provides quite a contrast to the rolling English meadows and sunny London. Pure genius.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
205,junelee-00754,My Favourite Movie,9,17 March 2017,"This is my first review on IMDb and it goes to Four Weddings and a Funeral. I have watched it for more than 5 times, and every time I felt something similar but also something different. I like the way the movie contains lots of philosophy of life through love stories, heart- lightening scenes and little jokes. I much appreciate British movies for being relaxed and reflective at the same time, but not trying to ""persuade"" its audience to follow their ideas. Some may think people have overrated it because of rude jokes but it is certainly not the case. Instead, life is among every rude jokes, and this movie reminds me of being true to myself.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
206,WaterNai,One of the best movies of all time,10,20 April 2006,"This movie is about as close as one can get to a perfect film. The plot strikes the right balance between comedy and drama, and the acting is excellent. The film has so many solid British actors. John Hannah is one of my favorites. In addition, many of the actors for supporting-supporting-characters are still seen quite frequently in film and television. My one problem with the movie is that last bit of dialog, something along the lines of, ""Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed."" Gah, terrible! I wish something had been done about that. Overall, I think this is a better film than both Love Actually and Notting Hill, though Love Actually was quite good. Four Weddings and a Funeral is a classic that stands up to many viewings. Highly recommended!",Four Weddings and a Funeral
207,w-04510,A disagreeable but splendid comedy,8,30 April 2019,"I have to say the setting, the plot, the cast and everything is almost perfect. The end is extremely perfect. But I'm a bit mad at how irresponsible the protagonists can be in the process. Of course love has different forms and people have the right to fall in love in their own way. But it's better when they consider if what they do will do harm to other people. In one word, don't waste the time, never pretend to love/ not love someone. If you don't mean it, don't say it. If you do mean it, then please just do it.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
208,summerskter,So overrated it should be criminal,2,27 July 2011,"This movie is so frustratingly forgettable. It is a romance which makes absolutely no sense to the viewer.The object of affection is a promiscuous, threesome-having, cheating, superficial, self-absorbed woman named Carrie, which Andie Macdowell plays as if she were just a breezy, soft-spoken nice girl. Andie is so uncomfortable in this role that every single line is delivered in a monotone drawl. If you can get through her last line, ""Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed,"" while they are standing in a downpour, without laughing, my hat's off to you.Without spoiling to much, let's just say if you value romance, like actual romance involving two people getting along, spending some quality non-sex time together, you are not going to find it in this hollow, mechanical movie. And when I mean hollow, I mean so completely insincere that anyone who lives in the real world would find the characters' behavior mystifying until the ending credits. I still don't understand what this movie was trying to say.I was 100% rooting for Hugh Grant (Charles) to end up with either of the two eligible women who are actually loyal and devoted to him, and who don't treat him and his feelings dismissively throughout the entire film, as Carrie does.So terribly disappointing.",Four Weddings and a Funeral
209,lizlemon-86433,What's with the hype?,6,2 July 2018,"I feel like this movie is thought of as some rom com classic but I kinda don't get it. Hugh Grant is soooooo cute and the supporting cast is really charming but when you think about it, it doesn't make a ton of sense and the jokes are kinda stale. I guess if you loved it when it first came out you might still, but if you haven't seen it before, don't be surprised if it's not as good as everyone says. Curtis has better movies sorry!",Four Weddings and a Funeral
