0,SnoopyStyle,Hard to rate Experiment,5,2 October 2013,"What the F? I can't tell if this is a successful experiment, or a sad depressing self indulgent mess.The success is that Vincent Gallo has given a portrait of a grimy sad loner. He is truly creepy, and you can almost smell the dirt. The women that fall for him are just pathetic.On the other hand, this is really an unwatchable mess. This movie has absolutely no pace. The camera doesn't move, doesn't cut, and hold on forever. Long sections scream out for some dialog. Some artsy crowd would say it's mesmerizing. It would only be mesmerizing if you're on something.Then there is the blow job from Chloë Sevigny. I guess it's done to shock the audience. It does shock but I'm completely conflicted about it. So I will not add or minus points for it. I would never recommend this to anyone even if they're film buffs. Gallo must have a giant ego.",The Brown Bunny
1,claudio_carvalho,Looking for Daisy,5,27 December 2014,"After racing in New Hampshire, the lonely motorcycle racer Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) drives his van in a five-day journey to California for the next race. Along his trip, he meets fan, lonely women, prostitutes, but he leaves them since he is actually looking for the woman he loves, Daisy (Chloë Sevigny). He goes to her house and leaves a note telling where he is lodged. Out of the blue, Daisy appears in his hotel room and soon he learns why he cannot find her.""The Brown Bunny"" is an independent very low budget movie by Vincent Gallo. The plot is developed in slow pace and is dull and boring in many moments. The revelation of Daisy's secret is totally unexpected. However the movie has become famous only because of the unnecessary fellatio of Chloë Sevigny, maybe to satisfy Vincent Gallo's ego, since does not add anything but a polemic scene to this movie in a poor hype. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not available on DVD or Blu-Ray",The Brown Bunny
2,rmax304823,The Ego Has Landed.,2,20 February 2006,"Why bother? Vincent Gallo, a motorcycle racer, is so magnetic that waitresses throw off their jobs and leave farewell notes at a hint. (He produced the movie.) He's not particularly good looking but he's sympathetic because he acts depressed all the time and women want to cuddle him. Montgomery Clift could pull this off very well. He could make us believe it. Gallo can't. The movie amounts to a porno film with only a few seconds of celebrity paparazzi shots of Chloe Sevigny. (What is she doing in this piece of garbage?) If you want to see a male narcissist suffer for no particular reason while women fall all over him this is your kind of movie. As for me, I think the motives may be no more than those behind Sylvester Stallone's skin flick, an opportunity to seal on film how sturdy your erections are.",The Brown Bunny
3,BA_Harrison,It blows. Or sucks. Either one will do.,1,13 September 2019,"Watching The Brown Bunny is like taking the most boring road trip ever accompanied by the most unlikable bloke imaginable, after which he gets a blow job and you don't.Directed by and starring Vincent Gallo, this self-indulgent art-house snooze-fest follows motorcycle racer Bud Clay as he drives from New Hampshire to California, with brief encounters with several women along the way. When he gets to Los Angeles, he meets up with old flame Daisy Lemon (Chloë Sevigny), who gets a shot of protein to the back of the throat in the film's infamous un-simulated oral sex scene, after which we learn the tragic truth about how their relationship ended.99% tedious shots of Gallo driving down highways, filmed through the windscreen, badly framed and frequently out of focus, and 1% Sevigny slurping sausage, this is precisely the type of unmitigated garbage that gives arthouse cinema a bad rep. It's ultimately a study of a man struggling with guilt and grief, which is all well and good except for the fact that it is also utterly boring and ugly to look at for most of the time. If it hadn't been for the fact that an established actress performs fellatio for reals, I suspect that The Brown Bunny would never have seen the light of day.",The Brown Bunny
4,Bunuel1976,"THE BROWN BUNNY: Theatrical Release Version (Vincent Gallo, 2003) BOMB",1,20 February 2006,"Although I had long suspected that the notorious unsimulated fellatio sequence would be the only reason for me to watch this movie, I had no idea that I would have had to suffer through around 75 minutes of excruciating boredom before it got there! Having just come from a 3-month film-making program in Hollywood, I can understand a director succumbing to the temptation of pointing his camera at anything hoping that it will eventually make sense in the editing suite; however, Gallo's film looks and feels like all the available footage has just been pasted together without any editorial intervention! Scenes just go on and on without any rhyme or reason, characters whisper unintelligibly all through the picture and Gallo's character comes off as a chick magnet with no sex drive, and a cry-baby in the bargain!! I can't begin to think how the Cannes Film Festival audience felt when having to sit through an even longer (by 26 minutes!) cut of the film! As for me, I found myself helplessly bursting into laughter occasionally at the sheer self-indulgence, pretentiousness and absurdity of it all; even that sequence is not free of chuckles, as Gallo has his character and Chloe Sevigny's carrying on a would-be rhetorical conversation while the latter is giving him (pun intended) lip service!! I can understand the furore this sequence has caused given that it features a recognizable, Oscar-nominated Hollywood starlet but, again, Gallo is hardly breaking new ground here, as explicit oral sex sequences featuring established actors were also featured in Nagisa Oshima's AI NO CORRIDA (1976) and Marco Bellocchio's DEVIL IN THE FLESH (1986; I can't wait to get my hands on the No Shame DVD)! Maybe he just decided to insert the scene because someone reminded him that the word ""gallo"" in Italian means ""cock"" - as in rooster. The ""twist"" at the end makes everything, particularly that sequence, all the more stultifyingly inept and redundant...",The Brown Bunny
5,Mr-Fusion,Insufferable,2,4 August 2015,"By now, it's no secret why anyone would sit through ""The Brown Bunny"", and the best advice I can offer is skip to the 80-minute mark. You won't be titillated, but the curiosity will be sated. Apart from that notorious scene, the whole journey to this point is a grueling series of static camera shots, aimless drifting and lots of driving. My god, the driving. It's not so much that I didn't like Vincent Gallo or his character in this (I didn't), it's that I wanted something to happen. We just hang there awkwardly in scenes and the lack of rhythm was the most frustrating. There's a narrative twist at the end which serves as the movie's fulcrum, but it just keels the whole thing over.It's not the story being told, it's the guy telling it. I know this is supposed to be a sad art-house movie, but it's Gallo driving cross-country for a blowjob. To be fair, it's not the crime against cinema that the Internet has made it out to be, but it's also not something I want to endure again.2/10",The Brown Bunny
6,thesar-2,Bunnies Would Even Hop Away from this Mess,1,2 December 2012,"The Satellite of Love crew would've had a field day. Manos: The Hands of Fate's opening scene stretched amongst about 60 min of film. Wait, there's more! Within the first 2/3s of the film we have the hero do amazing things! He buys gasoline & Chinese food! He drinks coffee! He buys a Coke! He takes a shower! He kisses a complete stranger in a park! But wait! There's more! Most importantly, he drives! And drives and drives. And thendrives some more. Watching someone drive such a distance is like watching someone read for an hour. I have read reviews where people complain nothing happens. I laugh at the movies they pick for these comments? They need to go back to edit their reviews on those movies. This could've been rated G until the finale, a completely unnecessary sexual scene (or two). We get the point; we get to the surprise twist. I watched to the end, every minute of his journey from the East to the West; his loneliness. Yes, I liked the ending, the reason for all the madness but for shock value alone was the graphic closing scenes. I gave it 1.5/5, an additional .5 for the meaning at the end. I'll be kind & save you some time? He is lonely and depressed, he drives and if you can skip to the final 2-3 scenes, you'll understand why & save yourself 1.25 hours of watching one drive to get to the point. I have two side notes: #1 I am a true believer in extras on a DVD, the delete scenes, the making-of, etc, and thank GOD, this had no delete scenes? Boy, anyone could do without extra **exciting** hours of driving from Albuquerque 2 Vegas. And #2, though I love Las Vegas scenes in movies – I'm a gambler, sue me- he would've taken a long detour to go from where he was headed to Sin City. Don't screenplay writers ever research their material, their physical journeys before putting pen to paper? This is a story of one man, his journey and a director's vision of hard porn for about 3 min. Buckle up, it's gonna take you 90 min to get what you rented the film for.",The Brown Bunny
7,Bored_Dragon,"Slow, boring, but it has its worth",4,9 October 2016,"Probably the slowest movie I have ever seen. If there was no good music in it, it would be unwatchable.After the race, a guy packs up his motorbike in the van and he drives, drives, drives, and drives some more and make a stop to get some gas, flirt with a cashier, then drives again, and drives, drives, goes to a pet shop and then drives again...The complete story from this ninety minutes movie easily fits in fifteen minutes. Then the movie ends and leaves behind such emotion that I have to recommend it even if it is boring as hell. The fact is that Gallo is irritating, and even more so as a director, but man, he can act, he really can.4/10",The Brown Bunny
8,ironhorse_iv,"I guess, I now know why the bunny is brown. It's mostly cover in crap.",4,1 August 2016,"The Most American of all film genres, has always been the Road Trip movies. It has showcase, the best and worst parts of the living in the U.S of A. What setting offers a better backdrop for examining America's freedom, rootlessness, yearning, adventure, and struggled. It is not surprising, then, that the theme of liberation initiates the action of many great road movies. However, this movie is not one of those. This movie literally blows. Directed by Vincent Gallo, the movie tells the story of a love-sick professional motorcycle racer Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) heading cross-country from the east coast to the west in an attempt to reconnection with a lost-love, Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), while along the way, being tempted by a various of women, who might provide him with the cure of his own self-loneliness. Without spoiling this movie, too much, I have to say, this vanity project is most famous for the infamous graphic 'blowjob' scene, between Gallo and Sevigny. At the time, it was very edgy as it broke down the division between hardcore pornography and softcore movie erotica. A lot of people got offended, because of it, for some odd reason. For me, I really didn't mind it, after all, the oral-sex scene is by far, the most entertaining part of the film. It's somewhat sexy to watch. In my opinion, the rape scene is far more graphic and disturbing than anything else in the film. I'm surprised that people are not shock and offended by that, more. Despite that, in my opinion, the unstimulated fellatio or the hardcore rape scene is not the problem on the film, despite it nearly killing Sevigny's career. The problem is the pacing. When the self-absorbed film was first screened for the press at the Cannes Film Festival in 2003, critic Roger Ebert called it ""the worst film ever shown at Cannes"", because of that problem. In result, it prompt a prolonged feud of words between Gallo and Ebert, throughout the years. Is the hatred deserve? Well, in my opinion, yeah. The original version wasn't good at all. For the most part, the long cut was there to serve as a way to show, how Daisy's absent, haunts Bud, but it comes across, more like boring and pretentious. It had way too much, bland emptiness with no delivery of its story. It's full of endless driving sequences that serves nothing, but filler. I can understand, why people walk out at the theaters at Cannes, just to get away from this American independent art house film. It wasn't thought provoking. It didn't make you feel for the character. It just made you, hate yourself for wasting time and money. The hatred for the film was so strong, that Gallo had to reedit the film to fight back against the negative backlash. He cut 26 minutes of his 118-minute film, or almost a quarter of the running time. Even with that, the remaster version is just as long & vain as the first version of this film. The film's limited theatrical release in the United States was a total bomb at the box office. However, the reedited version of the film, did impress Ebert who gave the film, his signature 'thumbs up'. For me, no matter of tightened the storyline would make this a good movie. Still, I have to give the movie, some credit. The controversy-provoking film ended with a shocking, melodramatic plot twist to explain Bud's complex personality and downer mood throughout the film regarding Daisy as his lost love - the only woman he ever loved. It was alright for the most part, as it does explains, why he was living a life of solitude & grief. I also love some of the symbolism, this film has, even if the titular motif was somewhat limited. After all, the symbolism of the bunny related to the character of Daisy, so much. Since rabbits rely so much on their solid intuition, they sometimes forget to ""look before they leap."" This spontaneous behavior can lead to mistakes or even dangerous situations, hints on what happen to Clay's love-interest. While, the bunny mostly represents Daisy; it may also can signified Clay's behavior, as rabbits can become so focused more on their fears, rather than on their end goal. This can cause extreme anxiety that holds them back from making any big decisions in life and moving forward. It's explains, most of Clay's masculine insecurity. I also love the fact, that the movie, somewhat remind me of the plot of 1925's 'The Great Gatsby', with a man desiring to gain the attention of a woman named Daisy. The fact that all of the women in the film have flower names, makes this film, somewhat clever. First off, you got Daisy, whom named means 'Innocence' & 'hope'. Then, you got the teenaged New Hampshire gas-station cashier Violet (Anna Vareschi), whom name represented, 'loyalty, devotion, faithfulness'. No wonder, why she goes with Clay. Then, you got the trouble-middle-aged Lilly (Cheryl Tiegs) who represent 'the yearning of youth'. Last is the young Las Vegas street hooker Rose (Elizabeth Blake) whom names after the themes of 'love' & 'desire'; two things that Clay really wants. Still, it's a bit sad, that none of these actresses were really that memorable, despite their character's names. Honestly, it was reportedly at one time, Winona Ryder and Kirsten Dunst were to be in the film in two of these roles, but presumably dropped out, due to conflict with Gallo. It really shows, how self-indulgent and vain, the director could be. In the end, most of the acting throughout it is mediocre at best. Overall: This rabbit movie doesn't have a foot to stand on. It's unlucky, it will ever get popular, as movies about loneliness and solitude, don't equal entertaining. Because of that, I can't really recommended watching this film.",The Brown Bunny
9,Rodrigo_Amaro,"It's vanity, egocentricity, audacity at its best",6,10 April 2011,"What can I possibly say about ""The Brown Bunny"" that already wasn't mentioned before? Nothing. Here's a director/writer/producer/director of photography/camera operator/editor/main actor that is so full of himself that this film is almost a one man job about a despicable character who keeps wandering around the country, picking some girls on the way and leaving them behind, trying to forget the love of his life. The plot is clear for us viewers from the beginning? No. Basically, the plot of ""The Brown Bunny"" happens in the final half hour but until you get there, you already fall asleep, if you get easily distracted with stories that takes all the time in the world to develop in front of you. Bud Clay (played by the multitask man Vincent Gallo) walks, drives his van carrying a motorcycle, pick up some women and dumps them with no reason, he barely talks and when he does it is very difficult to hear what's he saying. And the whispering gets worse when he finally meets his girlfriend or wife, I don't know, played by Chloë Sevigny, because these two whisper and whisper, and the higher you turn up the volume it doesn't gets better.Gallo throws lots of woods in the bonfire of controversial films and controversial screenings at Cannes Film Festival along with ""Irreversible"". Critics complained about how long the shots were (and some of these shots were trimmed down because it was so excessive), most of the shots are pointless, but the movie itself is pointless reserving its best moment in the conclusion, which is also the reason behind all the elevated fuzz about ""The Brown Bunny"".The plot only happens in the final half hour, the meeting between the couple with an almost inaudible conversation, the woman trying a reconciliation that leads to the most explicit oral sex scene ever filmed between known actors. People at Cannes went crazy after this, they thought they had enough of this film and Gallo heard the boos, shouts, people walking out and all, and last the critics attacks. I think this scene really is the best in the whole film, it has a deep meaning between the two characters, and the actors had lots of guts in performing it, she really goes down on him. And to those who think this is porn, it's not, Gallo really made something sexual looks like art, there's no sense of scandal (but not everyone will enjoy this). I don't see problems in this scene, it is a wake up call to us about what reality really is, sex happens, and a wake up call in the plot itself that took so long to develop, to make us interested in the experience. There's something good about this film although I'm not quite sure what. Maybe it was the unconventional story (if there is one), the most debated scene, or simply seeing a director giving the middle finger to everyone, to the mainstream audience and presenting his own vision of reality careless of what people will think. It's vanity, egocentricity, audacity at its best. 6/10",The Brown Bunny
10,Polaris_DiB,Let's be consistent here,9,2 July 2006,"Since this movie is known most for the controversy, I am going to start and finish with it to reflect people's habit of starting and ending their impressions of something with a scene out of context. It wasn't porn, and my argument for that comes completely from the context... what happens directly before and after that moment. Basically, people have been angry at Gallo for being self-involved in this movie, especially that scene, but during that scene the self-involvement is literally the point. It's masturbatory, but the key is that it drains him, just like masturbation. One thing the DVD box says about it is that it's one of the ""frankest portrayals of male sexuality on film"" and so let's be frank here.His sexual confusion is part of his grief, and part of grief is the habit of trying to deny it actually happened. So when he starts acting dominant during that scene with what's happening, it's his subconscious trying to throw a sort of male sexual dominance over something he doesn't understand and hasn't allowed himself to accept. But when it drains him, he's forced to admit that he doesn't only grieve for her but hates her for forcing him into that grief, and from there comes probably one of the best conversations (or inner dialog) I've seen in film in a long time.But does it necessarily need to be ""shown"" rather than implied? Well yes. Because the character's focus is so involved on it, it literally is all his mind is allowing him to care about in that moment. Basic rule of a close-up: if the camera focuses on something like that, then the director is trying to point something out. If it's porn, it's meant to arouse... but this scene isn't arousing, especially because of its context.But enough of that, because I want to discuss something else about this movie. Partly because of the controversy around this movie, and partly because of the publicity, I had the initial impression that Gallo was an abrasive and over-masculinized character in this film. Wow, complete opposite... I totally related to his character. Of course, his short relationships with those women don't seem to work at first, but once we get an idea of where he's coming from in his grief (and men's general dislike of expressing it or asking for help), the relationships make perfect sense in terms of being representational (thus the obvious motif of all of their flower names and his name as ""Bud""). Basically, the first woman fits what he's looking for courteously, the second emotionally, and the third emotionally, but none of them match the full attraction he has to the only woman he's ever loved. I liked it.And the long continuing imagery of the road trip was really neat too, as it actually really captured that introspective feeling of it. Most roadtrip movies show the car in moments of time from the exterior... which kind of changes the perspective of what a roadtrip is. This movie shows it literally from the passenger seat, complete with the dirty/smudged window and the long road stretched ahead. I think there was only one shot that was actually an exterior of the van when on the freeway, the rest of the exteriors were when the van was parking or he was stopped somewhere. I find it very lovely, ultimately, and as my mother once said, ""The road trip is something of a rite of passage amongst American males. It's a moment when they take on as much of the world as they feel necessary all on their own."" Gallo seems to have the same idea, though there is a major American film genre built around that idea as well: the road as a literal transfiguration of self-discovery.So, going back to the controversy, it really disappoints me that this film has to be known for that when there is so much more art and beauty and innocence it has to offer. I also find the controversy rather inconsistent, considering most people have absolutely no trouble with the female body in various states of arousal, yet as soon as ""the male gender"" is shown, it's pornographic! The funny thing is, it contributes to that very male sense of fear and dominance they feel they must assert sexually. So I guess I could make an argument that Gallo did that scene to attack that inconsistent form of sexual censorship, but if I didn't already know that basically Sevigny and he agreed to do it because, ""Why not, we were in a relationship, we did it before, might as well just show it!"" --PolarisDiB",The Brown Bunny
11,smatysia,This movie sucks (pun halfway intended),5,13 January 2006,"Well, this film carries long, long stretches of not very much. Thank God I saw the edited version, and didn't have to sit through 26 more minutes of nothing. A film doesn't have to have action, car chases, explosions, etc. to entertain. Thre's nothing, at all, wrong with quiet character studies. That's what this turns out to be, but it takes a long time to get to that. I thought for a long time that this was just Vincent Gallo indulging himself at playing director. The exposition at the end, for those who stuck it out that long, was surprisingly powerful. Have to hand it to Gallo, I didn't see it coming, although I may have been numbed by what came before. Cheryl Tiegs showed some courage, in view of her tremendous beauty in earlier decades, by being filmed as a fairly un-attractive fiftysomething. And Chloe Sevigny showed some herself, allowing herself to be filmed blowing Gallo (not simulated) like some porn queen. I understand that it did not do her career much good. Early in the film Anna Vareschi looked so cute an d sweet in a small part. Too bad she didn't get more screen time.Overall, it is hard to recommend this film. At least it's different. And there is a payoff if you can last that long.",The Brown Bunny
12,rooprect,Like snorting wasabi peas up your nose,8,18 July 2010,"If you don't know what a wasabi pea is, let me describe: It is Satan, hell, a ruptured spleen & your ex-wife's soiled dungarees all wrapped up into a green jellybean. Eating one is the most excruciating experience of your life. But then 10 seconds later, you love it & want more.That is ""The Brown Bunny"".The movie takes us through (what seems to be) an endless, pointless, excruciating waste of film with long scenes that seem to go nowhere. The main character seems to be suffering from depression or delirium or maybe he's just swallowed a shoe full of quaaludes, but you have no clear idea why he behaves this way. He interacts with people who seem to have no connection to anything. You feel like you could make a better movie with your cellphone.But wait...If you have the tenacity, patience or curiosity to make it through the whole picture you will be rewarded (and I'm not just talking about the infamous BJ scene). Only in the last few minutes is everything revealed, and like that wasabi pea, it completely changes your perception of everything. And clears your sinuses.This is a great film because it dares to do something that no other film I've seen does. It proceeds without justification. There's no ""hook"", no ""foreshadowing"", no ""conflict"" or any of the other elements of the classic storytelling structure designed to keep the audience from snoozing or walking out. In true Vincent Gallo form (or even PT Barnum), he challenges the audience to see the show without telling you why. No, this will never be accepted by the casual moviegoer who's looking for entertainment. But if you approach it as you would approach a riddle (a 90-minute riddle), I think you'll be completely satisfied & wanting more at the end.Watch it a 2nd time, and you will be absolutely riveted by the same scenes which, earlier, seemed to be a waste of time.Oh by the way, yeah, you get a pretty explicit shot of Vincent Gallo's crankshaft. Just thought I'd let you know so you don't watch it with your mom or something. That would be an awkward experience.",The Brown Bunny
13,RavenGlamDVDCollector,"truly, it is more fun to watch paint dry",1,15 November 2017,"I saw it years ago and have the DVD, but will never watch this thing again. Never. It has got to be the most boring movie ever made. It is like watching close-circuit security camera footage in an upmarket neighborhood, static imagery with no prospect of anything happening to liven it up. Chloe Sevigny? Yes, I had heard about the controversial blowjob scene, and I DID enter for that reason, mostly to see the mainstream interpretation of something only seen in porn, but, boy, was I put off by the lethargic pace, this dude who is so SO into himself that he believes it would be fun to watch him the whole time, however inconsequential his deeds. Watch Vincent do this, watch Vincent do that. The biggest egomaniac of all. Looks like FACEBOOK THE MOVIE featuring a motorcycle racer. Minus any excitement except Chloe - but wade in after her at your own risk. Not worth the bother. The movie is so bad it looks like maybe perhaps at the DVD store the guys broke the original Hollywood movie and quickly made a replacement. You're going to feel like the dumbest fool for watching. I kid you not.If they showed this on TV with ad breaks, the commercials would be the high point of the show. The weather forecast would hold your interest a whole lot more. You would be asleep long before the BJ.And if you wanna see hot chicks doing that stuff, try Hustler's Barely Legal, Vivid, Private and Digital Playground.",The Brown Bunny
14,rosscinema,"Well, what can you say?",4,11 September 2004,"After hearing all the controversy and horror stories about this film I'm glad that it's being released so that everyone can view it and see what all the fuss is about. Story is about a motorcycle racer named Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) who is trying to get over the end of his relationship with his girlfriend Daisy (Chloe Sevigny) and he travels state to state in a van on his way back to California. Very little happens as Bud drives but he does stop in his hometown and talks with Daisy's mother before getting back on the road.*****SPOILER ALERT***** From place to place Bud meets a few women and they all have names of flowers like the clerk at the gas station named Rose or the hooker in Las Vegas named Violet and the rest stop woman Lilly (Cheryl Tiegs) who Bud gets physical with. While in California he goes to Daisy's house and leaves a note explaining what hotel he will be staying at and while in his room Daisy shows up and a very graphic sex scenario occurs.Vincent Gallo wrote, directed, starred, and scored this film and while I do believe that he's a talented actor/director he can be his own worst enemy. The films pace (If I can call it that) is not only slow but it's really just a bunch of scenes of Gallo driving with the camera placed behind him so that the viewer has a passengers view of each shot. We see him make turns, we see him driving at night, and we get close-ups of Gallo endlessly looking scruffy with the occasional burst of tears. After all the hoopla what the viewer is really waiting for is the minor twist ending and the infamous scene of Sevigny performing oral sex on Gallo. I've seen a few films that had real sexual contact in it such as ""In the Realm of the Senses"" and ""Fruits of Passion"" but I was caught off guard by the scene and never in the history of cinema have we seen an Academy nominated actress engage in something thats totally hardcore. One can't help but wonder about the ramifications and if Sevigny's career will be hurt by this at all. She will certainly always work in independent films but will she ever get offers by the big studios for bigger money in more mainstream efforts? Time will tell and to be fair you have to wonder about Gallo's career as well but he along with Sevigny are the sorts that look down at major studio films and for the time being they might not care but as they get older their perspective might change. My comments shouldn't dissuade anyone from viewing this because it is a real curio and if your a hardcore fan of independent films than you'll be able to get through this easier than others. If your not used to seeing smaller films and your not a fan of the star than your probably going to consider this an extremely pretentious and slow self indulgent ego trip.",The Brown Bunny
15,Galina_movie_fan,Journey across America with Grief on the passenger sit,7,18 May 2008,"I have not seen the original Director's cut of the film that had created so much bad press after the screening at the Cannes Film Festival and prompted Roger Ebert make the statement that ""The Brown Bunny"" was the worst film in the history of the festival but the 92 minutes long version that Gallo himself re-edited is certainly not the bad movie. I'd say it is much better than hundreds of one star reviews on the Netflix movie's site lead you to believe. I personally agree with Vienalle Film Festival that awarded to ""The Brown Bunny"" FIPRESCI Prize ""For its bold exploration of yearning and grief and for its radical departure from dominant tendencies in current American film-making"". In exploring loss, regrets, yearning, grief, loneliness, inner numbness as the way to cope with pain caused by guilt, longing for the contact and inability to communicate, Vincent Gallo, writer/director/star/cinematographer/editor for ""The Brown Bunny"", definitely drove his point across (no pun intended). I think that Gallo found the right way to create a mood of quiet and unbearable desperation. The movie brought to my mind the line from one of the poems by Paul Verlen, French poet of the 18th century, ""I walked, accompanying my own grief"". Grief was the passenger in Bud's van and kept him company on the long journey across America, from New Hampshire to California. They had a lot to talk about but their conversations were speechless - that's why there is so much silence in the movie and only shots of Bud's face and his eyes.Many viewers (and reviewers) mention in their comments the notorious explicit scene of oral sex between Bud Clay (Gallo) and Daisy (Chloe Sevigny), the one true love of his life. Those who dismissed the movie as totally worthless say that without the scene, nobody would every bother watching ""The Brown Bunny"". I would not speak for everyone but I would've liked the film even without two minutes of graphic sex that in the context of the film is appropriately more disturbing and sad than anything else.

16,RainDogJr,The Brown Bunny is a unique film,8,27 May 2007,"I'm not a really Vincent Gallo fan, but i have to say that his first film Buffalo '66 is a complete masterpiece. But i don't like the fact that Gallo loves a person like George Bush or the fact that Gallo put himself in the screen like 10 minutes without dialog.This is the only thing that i don't like about his second film but well we need to say also the good things about Gallo and about The Brown Bunny.Vincent Gallo is now one of the most independent filmmaker in the world, he write, direct,act, edited, and also produced his new film. Also The Brown Bunny is such a original and unique film.Is about Bud Clay, a motorcycle who is going to California. In the way he meets 3 different women but we can see his feelings about another woman, who is Daisy his really true love.Finally in LA he meets Daisy in a hotel room where we can see that Daisy is by now only a memory of Bud.The film is good, i like the end and also all the story and well if i put 8/10 is because Gallo. Maybe if he does not put himself like 8 minutes only in his car without any dialog, The Brown Bunny could be a better film.As a conclusion don't listen to the critics that said that this film was the worst in the history of the Cannes festival. Watch the Brown Bunny and make your own comment.",The Brown Bunny

Bunny..,3,26 November 2004,"There was a famous drama teacher I read about several years ago, in one of his classes, would ask his students to walk around the classroom saying ""bunny bunny bunny"". Why? Who knows. This was the first thing I thought of after watching the godawful movie on display called ""The Brown Bunny"". Vincent Gallo is a professional motorcycle driver who, after finishing a race, packs up his bags and goes to California for the next race, meeting different women along the way, and then he.. Wait? Why am I telling you this for? All this movie will be known for, is ""the scene"". You know what I'm talking about. Yes, ""The scene"" IS pretty amazing.

20,MrGKB,The only thing worse than this film...,2,1 September 2013,"...is having to admit you watched it in order to write a review of it. Fortunately, home video has this thing called ""fast forward,"" a handy little thing that cinematic presentations can't deliver, and you can bet your bottom dollar I used it liberally while viewing this dreadfully pretentious, arid bit of self-indulgent nonsense. I get it; Vince ""Buffalo '66"" Gallo is an artiste. That's peachy. However, it doesn't mean he's a good one. Chloë ""Kids"" Sevigny is an actress who likes doing edgy, non-commercial stuff, even though she occasionally manages to get cast in mainstream films like ""Zodiac."" I get that, too. And Cheryl ""Definitely not an actress"" Tiegs is a dried- up ex-supermodel who needed something to do to stay in the public eye. I get that as well. But none of that provides any justification for ""The Brown Bunny,"" no matter how one might think otherwise.So, what does ""The Brown Bunny"" accomplish? Well, very little, actually. It cements Gallo's reputation as a narcissistic hack, destroying any commercial credibility he may have garnered as a writer or director. It confirms Sevigny's oral talents and determination to avoid becoming an A-list actor. It immortalizes the effects of encroaching old age on over-the-hill supermodels. And it undoubtedly puts a lot of foolish moviegoers to sleep before they get to the paltry sex scene that should have marked the end of a 20-minute short.That's all she wrote, folks; I can't be bothered to further dissect this withered corpse of a movie. Plenty of other mavens here have wasted far more bandwidth than I care to appropriate to warn you away from this thing. Watch at your own risk of stultifying boredom.",The Brown Bunny
21,Rogue-32,Worked for me.,10,30 August 2004,"I saw Buffalo 66 long before I started posting reviews at imdb, so I haven't written about that film but I loved it, I give it a 10, and after seeing The Brown Bunny at the Nuart on Saturday evening, I am here to report that I give Gallo's second feature film the same rating. A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding this movie, or just not appreciating it, or perhaps both. There are many reasons for this, none of them valid in my estimation. The biggest protests, from what I've been reading, seem to be in the 'lack of plot' and 'vanity project' areas.I can understand how the film would be a little slow for a lot of people, since it's basically an internal study, with none of the 'usual' mainstream (or even indy film) tactics. And in fact that's what I loved the most about the movie - how Gallo has the artistic wherewithal to be true to HIS vision of what a film can be, to how a plot of a film (and there IS a plot) can be played out in a different, less recognizable way, which leads to one of the reasons I think people are calling this a vanity project (aside from the infamous scene toward the end -- which I have to say is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL to the film, once you find out what's really going on with our sick puppy Bud Clay) : because the movie doesn't follow a 'typical' set-up, requiring a bit more patience on the part of the viewer, a lot of people feel more comfortable dismissing this unbelievably profound piece of work as a 'vanity project'. In reality, I believe the opposite is true: Gallo is giving his audience more credit than they perhaps deserve, in presenting such a stark, uncompromising character study. The fact that a lot of this audience chooses not to accept him on his terms does not diminish his power and the power of this movie.  Can't wait for the next one, Vincent.",The Brown Bunny
22,rainking_es,Narcissistic and pedant to the max...,2,19 July 2006,"In the late 90's Vincent Gallo made his debut behind the camera with ""Buffalo 66"" (he also wrote it and produced it). It was a bittersweet story about two losers that fall in love with each other. It was a kind and so tender. So, I was really looking forward to see Gallo's next project... and let me tell you: WHAT A DISAPPOINTING!! He's suffered sort of an involution: once he was totally honest and now he's totally narcissistic and pedantic. In his second film he shows us Vincent Gallo riding his motorbike, Vincent Gallo getting' a couple of Cokes from a drinks machine, Vincent Gallo crying because the world is too beautiful, Vinczzzzzzzzzzzzz.....There's no story, there's no script, there's nothing... Nothing to remark except what you all were expecting: that scene in which Chloe Sevigny gives a BJ to Vincent Gallo (of course). Well, Sevigny's skills for porno are improvable.

24,dave13-1,Just. Plain. Bad.,2,14 January 2012,"Roger Ebert called this the worst movie ever to appear at Cannes and the writer of Beneath the Valley of the Dolls knows crap when he sees it. Vincent Gallo - who wrote, directed, produced and edited this item, probably in his garage - stars as a motorcycle racer who drives across the country to compete in California. He drives. And drives. And drives. And considering that he is supposed to be a professional racer, he doesn't seem to have much enthusiasm for it, or flair, and this is a key failing. Racers are speed demons and daredevils. Dale Earnhardt would trade paint with you in a supermarket parking lot. Gallo makes the act of piloting a vehicle about as exciting as washing one.The road movie as existential quest has a long cinematic tradition, and this means that any new entry in the field needs to achieve genuine novelty or risk being trite. Yet, with its hand-held camera shots of Gallo driving in medium closeup, most of the film comes off like a drive cross country with your uncle, complete with randomly bad song choices and fly splatters on the windshield. Like a lot of indie films, this one tries to make a virtue of its lack of conventional film aesthetics and its grungy production values, as if this somehow makes it 'realistic'. Reality, of course, is boring. Thus 'realism' is only a worthy goal if its makes the fiction more compelling. Very little in this film is in any way compelling. The storytelling certainly isn't, as next to nothing happens. We get occasional glimpses of Gallo interacting with random women along the way, and some of the moments quietly yet articulately convey his character's pain and neediness. Unfortunately, this only serves to remind us that when he is alone in the scene, we get nothing from him as an actor. What we get is dead air. Note to Gallo: fiction is supposed to be interesting. And his portrayal of an emotionally bled out loner just isn't. He fails to make his character even minimally sympathetic or interesting, and thus although the viewer recognizes that his journey is a search for meaning in a life gone somehow off the rails, that viewer doesn't really care. Gallo could find the meaning of life or drive into the ocean with equally uninspiring results. In short, the film fails as a character study as thoroughly as it fails as a road movie. There is little to see, and even less to contemplate as we go along on this American odyssey. I suggest counting the windshield bugs.If you must watch this dog, look for Cheryl Tiegs as a woman sitting at a bench at a roadside rest stop. Yeah, sure, EVERY rest stop has a retired supermodel hanging out there. Highways are thick with 'em. Anyway, she hits the perfect note as a wary, yet in her own way needy person when she meets Gallo. Moments like these in the film hint that there was the germ of a successful idea here. Gallo lacked either the vision or the discipline to carry it through over the film's length. Filmmaking is generally a collaborative exercise. Indie artists decry Hollywood's committee approach as an artistic melting pot that confines cinematic mavericks. This is certainly true. It has the advantage, however of creating checks on directionlessness and egomania, and I suspect that a trusted collaborator could have pointed out the flaws in Gallo's approach before he exposed them on film. Ebert was right. This thing sorely needed a better edit. There was probably a pretty decent ten minute short in there someplace.What truly shocked me about this film was not the brief explicit scene - if indie film artists want to use sex to distinguish themselves from Hollywood's puritan wary mainstream, they should go right ahead. What was shocking about The Brown Bunny was that it cost $10 million, or roughly the budget of Pulp Fiction, to produce a movie that looked like somebody's film school thesis project, and which was thoroughly hated by 90% of those who saw it.If the road trip really is a metaphor for the pursuit of meaning, then Gallo got nowhere because this movie is pretty much lacking it.",The Brown Bunny
25,dragokin,Chloë Sevigny in action,2,18 May 2013,"I guess a lot of people were drawn to this movie because of some explicit images of Chloë Sevigny. This is in my opinion the most exciting moment of the movie. The rest is diluted in Vincent Gallo's character self-pity. After a third of the movie it is clear that he is suffering, but the time spent on describing it was far too long.On the other hand, i had the impression that the opening sequence got copied in the opening sequence of Sofia Coppola's Somewhere (2010). This must be a sign of it's importance in the history of movie making. The atmosphere and slow pace are in line with contemporary tendencies in art-house cinema, i.e. putting the average viewers to sleep.All in all, the plot was not bad, but was more suitable for a short movie.",The Brown Bunny

After laughing out loud for about a half hour at how nothing had happened yet, I decided to just fast forward through the long boring scenes of driving. When a song started to play and I was forced to look through a bug splattered windshield at the road I simply fast forwarded until the song ended. I did this at least three or four times. Also, when scenes in which I knew nothing was going to happen began, such as when he drives into a gas station and I know already based on the rest of the film that nothing is going to happen except him pumping some gas, I fast forwarded. I watched the scenes in which something was happening, like when he hugged the woman at the rest stop or picked up the young hooker and kept fast forwarding through the driving until I got to the end and I watched that.

He finances his own odd films by doing odd work in other people's odd films. I don't think there has been a movie he's been in that wasn't worth seeing, if only for his intensely offbeat performance. ""The Brown Bunny"" is about as close to a one-man show as you can get in the collaborative medium of film. Gallo, wrote it, directed it, filmed it, did music for it and acts in it. Yes, it may seem egocentric to have his name flash on the screen twenty times during the credits... but what's he supposed to do... lie and make up phony pseudonyms? This is a short movie (apparently it was a lot longer when it was shown in Cannes and got booed) but it still seems long because of its ultra-slow pacing. Scene after scene of Gallo riding his motorcycle into the distance, standing in doorways, listening to music, coming on to strange women and driving around a city block... all in slow, deliberate detail. None of it really makes much sense until the devastating finale (and by ""finale"" I mean what is revealed *after* the notorious fellatio scene).

And you'll need it. It is a long 90 minutes. You'll be sitting through long scenes with no dialogue shot with a gritty look. We are voyeurs watching this man travel alone trying to assuage his loneliness with encounters with women of the street. It is not fun, it isn't particularly interesting either. When we find out why this man is suffering it sends shivers down your spine but only for a minute. It is touching and sad however, after sitting through the beginning and middle it feels a little bit like a cheap trick. Just a bit.

Great movie to put on while you're taking a dump, down the hall in the bathroom. I liked Buffalo '66 much more.Ebert's opinion, which made me laugh:Roger Ebert called the film ""the worst in the history of Cannes,"" to which Vincent Gallo responded that Ebert was a ""fat pig with the physique of a slave trader."" Ebert paraphrased a remark of Winston Churchill and responded that ""Although I am fat, one day I will be thin, but Mr. Gallo will still have been the director of 'The Brown Bunny.'""

31,samkan,A Not-So-Noble Effort,4,6 August 2007,"I had to ask myself, what if I'd watched this movie fresh without the notorious - or any - warning? I think I would be initially intrigued, then increasingly frustrated to the point that I'd be demanding a huge pay-off, explanation, etc. Well, a pay-off of sorts arrives near the end, although it does not serve as an explanation, nor serve as anything, for that matter.I tend to overuse an analogy to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"", a century's old child's fable by Hans Christian Andersson. Therein, fraudulent tailors promise a king a lavish, extraordinary robe, proclaiming the garment is so special that the ignorant cannot even see it. As the garment is being prepared, the king, his court and yes-men, unable to see anything despite the tailors apparent efforts, mask their insecurity by professing wonder until EVERYONE is pretending to see something that is not there. Paraded before the peasants (who stifle laughs to save their heads) a young boy becomes the only person in the kingdom to point out that the king is naked.Brown Bunny is naked. If I, like the young parade viewer, lack the film critic pretense, Cannes sensibility, and movie intake of others, I know what I see. Up until the notorious scenes, I see an unashamed copying of a zillion other art movies; e.g., angst-inspired close- ups, overlong real-time single camera shots, minimalist, mundane dialog, etc. Towards the end, I see footage that gave the term, ""Art House"" a bad name.At this point, the court of royal film experts is calling me stupid. Raw sex may or may not fit into the movie's ending. There are ways to simulate such while capturing the carnality and making your point. Promoting explicit fellatio as necessary for art's sake is a convenient substitute for talent. Gallo is a tailor threatening my exposure as a dumb peasant. I'm not in the royal film court and wish to keep my head. But as my teenage children would say, ""Duh! Its called E-X-P-L-O-I-T-A-T-I-O-N, daddy!"".",The Brown Bunny
32,random_avenger,The Brown Bunny,7,16 August 2010,"Having heard so much about the infamous The Brown Bunny over the years, it was difficult to watch it with a blank mind devoid of expectations when I finally got to see it in the small hours of last night. Ultimately it's a fairly interesting effort, expectations or not. The plot is very simple: a motorcycle racer named Bud Clay (Vincent Gallo) begins a long cross-country journey in his van to the next racing location in California, all the while being haunted by memories of his former girlfriend Daisy (Chloë Sevigny) who he wishes to meet when arriving in his destination. On his way to her, he also picks up other women only to drop them off soon.I wasn't bothered by the long scenes of Gallo silently driving by himself, even though the cramped mise en scène and grainy cinematography make them less easy to enjoy than such scenes in some other movies ""where nothing ever happens"". The trembling camera inside the van creates a feel of a documentary, while the more spaciously framed outdoor shots balance the mood with their artistic calmness. The scene of Bud taking his motorcycle out and riding it on a salt desert is especially good-looking and captures a sense of loneliness powerfully.The very soft dialogue and Bud's habit of picking up and dropping off women provide hints to the nature of his relationship with Daisy. He also frequently cries by himself – what has happened between him and Daisy? The mystery gets its explanation at the end and the emotional payoff is pretty effective (and I'm not only talking about that one controversial scene but the whole revelation). The famous sex scene fits in the mood and its uncensored nature only adds to the rawness and prevents it from feeling phony.Ultimately the film is a curious exploration of feelings of guilt, regret, longing and loneliness, and while it's not as visually stunning and haunting as, say, Gus Van Sant's Last Days, it certainly doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Gallo and Sevigny are both good in their roles and the quiet atmosphere will have its admirers, but I think that some of the driving scenes still feel excessive even after Gallo's re-cutting of the film after the Cannes Film Festival incident. Perhaps some further trimming of the running time could have enhanced it, but I think The Brown Bunny is a worthwhile piece of cinema as it is now. For audiences who know what to expect, it should provide an enjoyable meditation on the emotional traumas people may encounter in life.",The Brown Bunny
33,Atavisten,It cant get more indie than this,7,30 October 2005,"Bud Clay is a professional motorbike racer who we literally follow in the car through the landscapes, through his depressive moods into a few casual encounters and at last an encounter that explains and gives meaning to the rest. Before this encounter I can easily understand if you get too much of Gallo's sad sad appearance and actions, and the endless landscapes of course accompanied by fine fine (depressing) music.'Buffalo 66', which he also did all of himself, really caught my interest for Vincent Gallo. He is no genius and he may be disgustingly self-centered, but there is a quality in his movies. Something about hurt and isolation that seems real. Directing, writing, photo, lead act and even makeup, I bet he also did some of the music. If you liked Buffalo 66, you will like this as well. Sevigny throws in a stellar performance also!Only thing is I think I had enough of him now.",The Brown Bunny
34,cgearheart,Watchably boring and pretentious,3,19 March 2019,"This movie should've been called an hour and a half of Vincent Gallo's sideburns... The blowjob sequence was honestly less memorable than all the different sideburn shots. The movie was a self absorbed sulk-fest that used a very graphic (and very overhyped) oral sex scene as a plot point at the very end. The movie is very boring and virtually pointless. Though it has moments of good acting and cinematography, it's truly just a big ol' pretentious boo hoo.

35,AJ4F,A road movie like no other,7,9 December 2009,"After watching this film, I read about the Roger Ebert flap; how he rated it the worst movie ever, then Gallo went back and cut out 26 minutes of redundant material, which transformed it into a much better film. I can see how that would be.The characters in some ways seem to be acting naturally and unscripted, but real strangers tend to do a lot more nervous chatter vs. long, silent staring sessions. In the world I'm accustomed to, greasy-looking guys with raspy voices and a demented air can't get women to want them instantly by staring or pleading. Or can they? Maybe I should make myself into a greaseball and see how it goes! Women are strangely fickle.It's a weird film overall but I could relate to the road footage and deep background music, complete with bugs on the windshield. I've seen no other movie that seriously recreated the feeling of driving cross country while depressed. ""Paris, Texas"" came close.I think it would have played better if we had more of an inkling why the character was so down. Just some hint to create more empathy; although in the end it all makes sense if you stick with it. I can see how people with short-attention spans would quit on this movie.The x-rated scene only seemed non-gratuitous when I put the whole plot together. In full context, the particular act they engaged in does make sense but I won't spoil the reason why.The final result is bleak and unique, like ""The Machinist"" in some ways. The entirety doesn't sink in until the end, and then you still have to think on it awhile. This is a movie I might only watch once but it was worth it.",The Brown Bunny
36,polysicsarebest,"Brilliant, haunting, what's not to like?",10,30 March 2010,"This film has received a lot of hatred, and I've racked my brain trying to figure out why. Then, it occurred to me: This film was not ""meant"" to be seen by most of the people who have seen it. See, there are art house flicks -- designed for art house audiences. Then, there are more, sort-of mainstream flicks -- designed for mainstream audiences. This all seems obvious, and it is, but it'll probably help to understand if you've heard something bad about this amazing film. Because of the controversy surrounding one short scene in this, some people who usually don't watch ""art house"" films have jumped on this film, and have walked away confused. Confusion leads to hatred, usually, since we fear what we don't understand, and often hate it too. On the other hand, while a lot of lovers of underground/experimental/artsy stuff are extremely open-minded, you'll find quite a bit of them who, pretentiously, will dismiss any new Hollywood vehicle for whatever reason -- just the fact that this film has Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny in it is enough for some people to hate it.So, you've got ""underground"" people giving it crap, you've got ""mainstream"" people giving it crap, you've got people misusing the word ""pretentious"" endlessly. So, in all this fire, the film itself is lost. Me, I don't really swing either way; I love Mean Girls as much as Dog Star Man, Home Alone as much as Water & Power, Freddy Got Fingered as much as Oh, Woe Is Me. So, I can appreciate this film on every level, because let's face it; if any film is worth appreciating, it's this one.Yes, this film provokes -- as any great art should, and does. It is thought-provoking, but it also tests the audience. It tests the patience, and the thinking power, and forces us to see things in a new way, to try to figure out what the characters were dealing with. It's beautiful. Simply brilliant. Also, it's genuinely moving, which is rare amongst films of this ilk. It's almost effortlessly moving, in fact; so good that it feels like Mr. Gallo wasn't even trying. He's just that talented.I don't even like the guy. He seems like a cocky snob. But he made a great film. Lonely, haunting... one of the most depressing films I've ever seen, actually. I loved it! If you enjoy stuff like Cassavettes, Fassbinder, Kaurismaki, Jon Jost... stuff that isn't simple and easy, and doesn't wrap up everything nicely, you'll probably dig this.

Of course all will be watching for the unsimulated sex ... a BBBJ, CIM and swallow (if you don't know the acronyms I feel sorry for you). From this point on you can feel the emotion. The first hour comes into focus.

Professional drivers must detest this film even more than the average person I would imagine; And given the rating on IMDb, obviously most people think it's crap.We even get to watch Gallo put gas in his vehicle for quite a while. What entertainment! What an artistic scene that was where we got to see him put a nozzle in and out of his vans gas tank. It made me horny, I mean snorey. What a f'n bore fest.The film is presented in a way that is obviously meant to be a very artsy piece, but seriously. It's no better than Andy Warhol's least inspired pieces; Like a painting of a can of soup, WOW! Amazingly dull stuff; Made either by dumb people, or ones who are too hopped up on some very good drugs to realize how overly stupid the stuff they are creating actually is.The story overall is not that bad in the end. However on the way there exists a few totally pointless scenes, and the lead up is far too long to make the climax of the film anything we give a crap about. By the end, people are throwing popcorn at the screen and screaming ""Shut the hell up you bumbling moron."".Without the much talked about real oral sex scene featuring the very talented Chloe Sevigny; I can't imagine many people in the entire world giving this film any more than a 2 out of 10 rating. Personally I don't even think the sex scene is that great. It certainly could have been much better. Chloe gives a better oral performance than Paris Hilton does in her widely known sex tape. But that isn't really saying much. I've been a long time fan of Chole's in terms of her acting, and I don't take anything away from her for attempting to push some limits with this scene. In fact it's kind of cool to see a well known Hollywood actress that I have watched for years take a chance and do a scene like this.

Here am I going bored out of my senses saying 'What on earth is this film's all about?' I decided to see what's left but then it turned out, it was getting more boring than it was the first few scenes started.In the meantime, to sum it up.. I think Vincent Gallo may've bored me and other viewers or film goers to death.. I wouldn't call it his 'masterpiece'. Yeah! People may respect him for doing other films like 'Buffalo 66' but still this is not up to my satisfaction. Even if the sex scenes try to put a smile on my face.. It didn't! Sorry Vince, but since you did the film.. You've landed actress Chloe Sevigny in hot water!Didn't like the film! This is pure pappy-show! A thumbs down.. 1 out of 10!",The Brown Bunny
41,LuckyFour-LeafClover,I liked it,9,24 December 2020,"Yes Vincent Gallo when he was more famous was a very speak your mind/un pc guy. While a lot of times I found him arrogant and a jerk I always felt ""I got him"" though and could put that aside and his appreciate his talents and skills.While this film has been categorized as a very narcissistic piece I didn't see it that way at all. I thought Vincent captured the mood of what's like for a person going through depression or is plagued by painful memories of a person or events. Life has that very slow and intense feeling which I think that's what Vincent was going for. Like driving across the country by oneself.You love this film or hate it it seems.",The Brown Bunny
42,neon47,Maybe I just don't get it.,1,7 August 2006,"Perhaps there's an underlying message in this shameful excuse for a ""movie."" Maybe I just don't get it. Brown Bunny seems to be a hit and miss movie, some love it others hate it. Thankfully I only spent $4.50 renting this waste of life. While the concept of the movie seemed to be really interesting, the attempt to bring of one of the most realistic portrayals of a male angst and sexuality to the silver screen, the overall effect of it is not. What do they do in the movie? Drive, and when that gets old they drive some more. As the movie progresses you'll find yourself asking: ""Where is this going besides to California?"" and here's the answer: it's going at a turtle's pace to a ""climatic"" finish that seems to be there mostly to be controversial. My boredom level reached an all time high during the coarse of a mere 89 mins. I found myself reading my video game strategy guide for Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, plotting the next coarse of action. Do what you will with this movie, I plan on staying far away from it.",The Brown Bunny
43,dav07dan02,brown bunny,5,11 October 2005,"Director/Script: Vincent Gallo, Cast: Vincent Gallo, Chloe Sevigny, Cheryl Tiegs Vincent Gallo is Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer who has just finished a race in New Hampshire and is now off to California for the next race. Most of the film takes place on his road trip cross country between the two places. Along the way, this very depressed individual meets three very different women. All of the women have a type of flower for a first name. Something happened that caused him to loose his girlfriend, a girl he has known since childhood. When he reaches Los Angeles, he desperately tries to seek her out which he does. By the very end of the film we finally learn what made him so depressed.This movie would probably be boring for a lot of people. Most of the film's time is spent showing him driving in his car cross country with various songs playing. I also traveled across country by myself so I actually enjoyed this aspect of the film. His driving across Ohio in the drizzle and rain with the windshield wipers flapping and Gordon Lightfoot's Beautiful playing is the film's highlight. Vincent Gallo is rather self-indulgent here. It is just him through most of the film. The film has very little dialog and the characters all all very underdeveloped. I thing he is trying to convey his longing fir Daisy, his girlfriend, so he tries to fill that empty void through the women he meets. One lonely soul he meets at a rest stop is a much aged Cheryl Tiegs. His longing for Daisy is shown in a fantasy he has of her giving oral sex to him. This leads to a twist in the film and we finally see why this man feels so much pain inside. The film would have been better if he would have developed the characters more. Especelly Rose, the prostitute he picks up in Las Vegas and the first girl he meets, the gas station attendant.",The Brown Bunny
44,bastard_wisher,"A beautiful, emotional mood piece... but watch it alone",10,4 November 2005,"I tried to watch this last week with a friend of mine and somehow it just wasn't working for us at the time, it seemed unbearably, self-indulgently slow. We turned it off before we even finished it.But i gave this another try today, as i knew i would need to, and this time i absolutely loved it. Still self-indulgent as hell, of course, to a fault, but that almost becomes one of it's charms. Either way it's as personal as any film i've ever seen, and that alone deserves some kind of recognition. It really forges a deep personal connection with the viewer given the right environment. I particularly like the last part of the film, where it picks up it's languid pace a little bit (it is a slow film, no question, but i think Gallo handles it well, certainly better than Gus Van Sant in his recent films). The bit with the prostitute is really great. The sense of intimacy created between the characters in the final sequence of the film is astonishing, and allows for ""that"" scene (you know the one i mean) to work effectively where otherwise it might have fallen flat. That said, i do think the final moments of the film were a little awkward and came dangerously close to seeming like a Vincent Gallo anti-drug Afterschool Special (although i liked the flashback footage), but the acting saved it. I must say also that the cinematography was quite great, the best-looking 16mm ever. I think it's kind of absurd that Gallo won't admit to a '70s influence, because it's obviously there plain as day. The best, most accurate retro-'70s film look and feel, even more so than ""Undertow"" (which i appreciate David Gordon Green admitting he went for a deliberately '70s feel in). Even the music adds to that distinct retro vibe. Speaking of music, i think the musical sequences worked alright, but at first they seemed a little tedious, just these long windshield shots. But it made for an effective mood-enforcer i guess. Really, the film succeeds or fails depending on your circumstances as a viewer, i think. What makes or breaks it is whether or not you are in a position which allows for a proper responsiveness to the mood of the film. That's really all the film is, an extremely (heartbreakingly) personal, albeit somewhat indulgent, mood piece.I did initially miss some of the humor so apparent in ""Buffalo '66"", though. It really occurred to me how much i like that film because of that, and i still like it better than ""The Brown Bunny"", just a little though. In retrospect, humor wouldn't have been appropriate for what Gallo was trying to do with ""The Brown Bunny"", i admit.",The Brown Bunny
45,peterpants66,A movie about a blow-job. The end.,2,31 July 2012,"There really is nothing like a Vincent Gallo film, their weird depraved little pictures with a few notable stars that end up haunting our memories for years to come. I liked Buffalo 66 and Gallo's appearance in the video for ""cosmopolitan blood-loss"" i thought was probably his best work ever, but this crap was nothing more then someone jerking off into our faces for ninety minutes. Nothing happens, try telling someone what the movie was about, lot's of Gallo riding his motorcycle while making out with a really busted crack-addled looking Cheryl Tiegs, and the blow-job that got me to wait in line to get in. It's not like i'd never seen a bj up until then, my friends wanted to go and it was the selling point for the movie. Random shots of the dashboard with some Gordon Lightfoot playing, seriously? This guy has gotten way to artistic to be understood and this film really did nothing for me or practically anyone else. I really don't know what happened to this guy, he seemed to ""have-it"" at one point and mysteriously lost it for this flick. Could you imagine seeing either Winoda Ryder or Kirsten Dunst doing the knob-job at the end! My god it would have been totally different, instead we get the equally hot but in film terms much more damaged goods Chole Sevigny pulling the line. Boring does not begin to asses my issue, it's a movie based around a blow job, and not a real earth shattering one either. Just a simple little fluf in an otherwise random and meaningless film.",The Brown Bunny
46,ellkew,Cant forget it,8,13 January 2006,"I can understand why some people dislike this film so intensely. It does not fulfil the criteria for a typical film. There is no hook to send you into the story, no dialogue (hardly), no conflict (apparently). Having said that when you sit down to watch a film a large part of yourself infuses that experience and colours it. I had heard about The Brown Bunny. Anyone worth half their salt has heard of the notorious Cannes screening. I sat down to watch it on my laptop (heinous crime I know) in a hotel room and when it finished I found myself very moved. I enjoyed this film for its style and Gallo's audacity to tell his story like he did. His performance was intense and when the end hits it provides an extremely powerful resolution to his state of mind. It was like a punch in the face. It feels to me that sometimes we seek out the stories we need to make sense of things, like we need to listen to music at certain times. Part of me knew that this film would satisfy me on a deep level and it did not fail in that. Hats off to Vincent Gallo for making such a startling film in this day and age in the USA.",The Brown Bunny
47,Ken-208,Worst Movie I have ever seen,1,7 October 2004,"This is the most boring, tedious, noxious movie I have ever seen. I stayed through the whole thing because the director was there and I wanted to hear what he had to say about the move -- I should have left. After about 10 minutes of the movie, if you don't like it then it does not get any better. Take a video camera, put it behind a man driving a van, and you basically have the movie. A lot of time watching a man drive around in the van, overexposed film while you are driving into the sun, and occaisionly he stops and has a one sentence conversation with a woman. Boring, tedious movie. Not worth waisting your time or money to see this piece of junk.",The Brown Bunny
48,Brakathor,"Horrible Dialogue, Nonsensical Plot, Horrible Pacing.",2,8 December 2008,"This is literally the first time I have seen a movie that was almost purely ruined due to the poor dialogue. Browse through some of the quotes to get an idea. The second and arguably equally or more important flaw is, simply put; This movie is literally one of the most boring films of alltime that tries to present itself as a serious piece of cinema. There is absolutely no semblance of a plot until the last 20 minutes of the movie, which beforehand is largely led by a string of seemingly random and nonsensical events, the most perplexing of which is when Budd stops to get a drink at a vending machine, passes a woman sitting on a bench, then sits next to her and the two begin inexplicably making out for minutes until he departs as suddenly as he arrived while the two never exchange a single word of dialogue. Also the scene in the beginning where Budd convinces a corner store worker to get into his van and drive off with him to California, after the two say barely more than a few words to each other, ending with him saying ""Please.... Please come with me."" felt painfully staged unrealistic, and sappy.Finally when the plot revealed itself to us during the last 20 minutes, I would like to make clear that unlike a lot of people I DID finally understand the point of this film, and what it was trying to express. Essentially this is a movie about a man who is clinically insane and has hallucinations, and therefore nothing displayed on screen is necessarily reality. I was in fact a strong advocate for another poorly received film, which like this film, was showing what an insane character with a mental disorders sees, rather than what the reality is ""The Hand"". One major difference between both movies is ""The Hand"" shows context behind the displayed events, whereas in this film there is no context whatsoever in any scene aside from the last 15 minutes. Nothing displayed beforehand makes any sense and it could mean or represent ANYTHING.If at least there was meaningful dialogue it could have been interesting, but with every scene and every character droning out 3 or 5 word sentences at the same tepid pace, it is not how people converse, it is not engaging, and it quite literally seems as though the actors are forgetting their lines. Compare this now to a movie like ""Warum Lauft Herr R. Amok"" Which like this film has literally no plot until the last 5 minutes. All the conversations in it were very engaging, very realistic and played out almost like a documentary which is what this film NEEDED to do in order to succeed in what it set out to do, and how it set out to do it, but quite simply, the people involved in this film thought they were vastly VASTLY greater than they really are to have made this, DO not know good cinema, and did not put the effort here.To be fair, the ending, when a plot was finally established was quite powerful, and the talk between Budd and Daisy IN ITSELF, was moderately well conceived which is why I gave this film a second star. This moment would have been quite effective in its own contained capsule, as everything that happens before these 15 minutes is completely inconsequential to this scene, and moreso, when it is revealed that the scene was Budd's hallucination, so then too was everything that preceded this scene, which was the ONLY scene of the movie with any shred of value to it, though appearing rather cheap and amateurish when the best it can do is to utilize such visionary artistry as seen in Japanese porno films with the censored fellatio scene, in which Chloe Sevigny claims that the sex act was not simulated, which absolutely floors me, for since it is censored, and given that any real sex act would therefore be irrelevant to the viewer, that is basically like saying ""I don't suck dick for any artistic end, I do it just for the taste of it."" I find that very amusing, but nonetheless it has to be said, if this scene was its own short film, it would have been effective.I hate to use the word arrogant, but when you produce a movie that 1. Has awful dialogue 2. Has plot devices that make no sense and have no context. 3. Is essentially an entire illusion of the main character. 4. 50% of which is comprised of nothing but shots of driving on the open road, which have NO artistic point; if they expect the viewers to find meaning and value in illusions which essentially have no meaning or context and are not even interesting, that is pure arrogance, and this film is indeed nothing but self indulgence. The point is, if you're like me and you watch a new movie a day, some of which are very well done and MUCH more clever, witty, well crafted, and have real meaning and an actual, why bother INVENTING a context behind an entire illusion of a movie to give it value and meaning, when it is painfully boring, illogical, and staged, and 50% of it literally consists of watching a man driving and walking.",The Brown Bunny
49,michellelocke007,what was the point of this film,4,2 October 2010,"had read and heard so much hype about this indie film when it was first released and roger eberts comments about it and i quote, 'the worst movie ever featured at the cannes film festival'. and i would have to agree with his summary. i'm not sure what Vincent gallo was trying to say when he wrote, directed and starred in this piece of egocentric film. like one reviewer said, i wanted to turn off my TV about five minutes into it and merely finished the films because of the notorious un-simulated fellatio scene with chloe sevigny who i give kudos for agreeing to star in this contrived piece of trash. i felt even more sympathy for her when she was immediately dropped by her talent agency and was blackballed by the industry for a period of time. fortunately she was able to bounce back by starring in the acclaimed series, big love. she had stated in previous interviews that she was comfortable doing the fellatio scene because she had known Vincent gallo in an intimate situation from before. i still don't understand the point of this film but maybe i should give it another viewing.",The Brown Bunny
50,abyoussef,An art film... without anything to say...,4,28 August 2007,"by Dane Youssef ""THE BROWN BUNNY"" plays out like an Andy Warhol-inspired exercise that was warped into a vanity project. Some moments are quietly effective and inspire little musings in our heads. But far too much feels like something little that a brown bunny left behind... that's also brown.Either the bunny or Gallo. He serves as writer, director, producer, composer and cinematographer. Hell, there's probably more...The film stars Gallo as Bud Clay, a professional motor-cycler going on one big long odyssey on the road to his old haunts to rediscover himself.He will uncover a lot of things along the way, particularly that he is trapped inside a movie that just plain isn't very good.Vincent Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" is a self-indulgent exercise in futility. Although Gallo may consider this a compliment, I mean the making of the film itself, not this hero's story. So masturbatory, I actually wished I was blind before I was even 1/4 of the way through.But it could have been. If Gallo had cut more of the scenes (and I don't just mean a few), put some music down on the soundtrack, shown more of the beautiful outdoor landscapes... and less of the interior of the car, Gallo himself just sitting there, preening. Striking a model-like pose in long, long, unbroken shots that feel endless.Gallo is a strikingly good-looking man, but not nearly so that we can watch him for that long without getting itchy and restless.You kind of wish the filmmaker (and there's only one--Gallo himself) had conjured up more music and put it on the soundtrack. Some music might have helped pump up a lot stillborn scenes. Gallo keeps the entire ""Brown Bunny"" moving at the pace of moss growing on a tree or rock.There's a lot of flat, still dialouge with a lot of dramatic pauses (in a pathetic attempt to pump it up), the acting isn't much (except for Gallo and Sevigny) and the long, unbroken static shots with Gallo is staring off into the distance (which there are more than TOO MUCH of) inspired me to itch so much, I thought I came down with a horrible rash.I know that the cut of the movie that was screened at Cannes (the film was not finished yet, but Gallo was pushed into releasing it) was indefinitely worse. But although I think that much of the editing was for the better (from what I've heard, it was vital), Gallo still needed to cut a few more scenes out of the movie and lay some more music here and there.Despite talent on Gallo's part and some ambition to tell a worthwhile story, ""Brown Bunny"" moves at the pace of moss growing, no one throughout the film as a character is particularly intriguing or well-developed, not even Gallo's own character (the exception is Chloe Sevign) and there are too many slow spot where we're just waiting for something, anything to happen.We don't have any idea exactly what Bud is thinking most of the time (or God help us, Gallo even). Maybe we're supposed to figure it out for ourselves. Perhaps Gallo wants our minds to speculate and wander. Is he leaving the thoughts of this Odyssey up to our imagination? Or did he just not think this one through.Also, much of the dialouge throughout every scene throughout the film was written is so badly recorded, I couldn't understand a word they were saying, I had to turn on the SUBTITLES.I'm capable of appreciating a deep, slow-paced movie. But this one isn't just slow, it's d.o.a.Many European filmmakers know how to make a slow movie work like a chess match or a staring contest, so that even when nothing is happening, it FEELS like Hell itself is breaking loose. Gallo obviously hasn't mastered that himself. He should have seen more of their work and studied it before putting ""The Brown Bunny"" into effect.But Gallo himself has admitted he is no filmmaker--or artist. In any sense of the word. He is a hustler. A Midnight Cowboy of sorts. He has acted, modeled, directed, wrote, painted... have I painted enough of a picture myself? He is a man of innumerable talents. But he has no major. He hawks skills at any given moment. He may not be a household name, but those that do know his name... look at him as something more than mortal.Curson, Frank and Gallo are credited for the musical score. At least Gallo admitted he needed some outside help there.Reformed supermodel Cheryl Diggs doesn't really provide anything else but filler to kill the static. Hey, maybe she serves a vital purpose after all.Chloe Sevigny (""Kids"" and ""Trees Lounge"") is such a good actress and has such a touching character, it's a damn crime against cinema she doesn't have more scenes. She should have been such a more substantial part of the film. She is a part of the fourth act where the comatose ""Brown Bunny"" bursts to life.At the end of it all, there is catharsis. Not just for Gallo's character, but for Gallo. And us. And his film. The powerful finale helps the effect of the whole film overall. Is it better to have an impressive two acts and a disappointing third or a mundane first two acts and a hard-hitting third?And I can't help but wonder, what of that brown bunny that sits in the cage? That holds the film's prominent title? What of it? What's it's story? I would have loved to see this world through it's eyes. What would it have to say? Do you wonder... ?--For Bud, Daisy and That Little Bunny, Dane Youssef",The Brown Bunny
51,darrin,Gallo is the real Dirk Diggler! LOL!,5,12 March 2008,"Trailer #1 begins with a quote from film EW critic Lisa Schwartzbaum: ""No one in America will ever see one frame of this film."" LOL! Well, I must be in the minority, because I was able to watch every frame. Even with minimal, inaudible dialogue, the visuals still managed to keep me interested. The explicit scene at the end of the film was erotic - at least from a male POV. If Gallo & Sevigny had chosen to pursue careers in porn, they would be more than adept! LOL! I have seen far worse films than this. Yes, Gallo is an acquired taste, but if you like offbeat films and acting, this should be right up your alley.

52,spooly_montana,UNDERRATED - reserve judgment until you watch film.,9,6 February 2007,"""Must be one of the truest songs of roadside America that the movies have produced."" - Charles Taylor, Salon.com This film was quite good, in my opinion. I had heard so many bad things about it before viewing - the pacing, shots, pretentious filmmaker (said he was ""better than Orson Welles""!), on and on. I heard from a friend of mine who was at the Cannes Film Festival premiere, in the audience at the showing, who did not like it. She said everyone thought it was laughable, and awful.THEN I saw it myself at long last. And I LOVED IT. Call me ""artsy-crazy"", but I just got the film. I understood why Gallo told the story the way he did.The slow pacing, the shots, the stuff said and not spoken at all. For many people, these are tedious things in the movie's telling, but for myself this steadily built up into a profound ending that put all of the film into perspective. There is a point after all of the wait, to the wandering in the film, and it is a good point. Well worth the patience some people will have to use to watch it through to the end.So many shots were exceptionally done: his use of sunshine, and framing is interesting, his use of sound, and the soundtrack IS INCREDIBLE. Listen to it if you get the chance, or better yet, I recommend you seek it out and buy it. John Frusciante (RHCP guitarist) did some songs exclusively for it.So why does not everyone get it? There are not enough quick cuts, and fast scenes showing a rapidly moving plot, with a huge climactic ending!! There is a ""climax"" definitely at the ending, but it lends itself to the telling of the story. It is an intricate weaving of someone's emotional state, and the melancholy he feels about a tragedy he cannot get a grip on. His lonely isolation is the feeling we view. We ride along with him in the van, and view the long outstretched road ahead to California, where he is going to meet Daisy, the only woman he has ever loved...I suggest strongly that you reserve your judgment until you see the film for yourself. There are two versions out there on DVD now: the Cannes Film Festival version (119 minutes), and the official DVD cut version (edited to 93 minutes). I have seen the Brown Bunny three times, and see more and more in it each time. I am looking forward to viewing the longer version.THIS MOVIE IS VERY UNDERRATED.

53,Krustallos,So they DO still make 'em like this...,10,17 April 2006,"The world is probably divided into those who understand why a long take of someone riding a motorbike across Bonneville Salt Flats to vanishing point can be great, exhilarating cinema and those who don't. I'm firmly in the former category, and if you are too, this is the film for you.One of the best American films of the past decade, from almost the first scene - a dreamy, hypnotic vision of a motorcycle race - it's clear that this is going to be something special and when the race finishes and a downbeat jazz tune kicks in behind Gallo stowing his bike away this is confirmed. Genuine cinematic magic.This has the rhythm and pace of a 60s/70's art movie like ""Two Lane Blacktop"" or ""Zabriskie Point"" - a time when Hollywood was prepared to actually take risks with the audience's attention span and take the time to look at the world properly. Gallo is the first American filmmaker in a long time to pick up that baton and run with it - or in this case drive. One of the all-time great road movies, this gives the American landscape, the sun refracted through a windshield, rain hitting a wet road, the attention they deserve instead of just using landscape as backdrop for action.The ending arguably unbalances the movie somewhat by resolving all the ambiguities and making too much of a concession to conventional drama.

54,hohumdedum2,A Misunderstood Movie.,8,16 August 2005,"There has been much controversy over this film, and today I rented it to be the judge for myself. I believe this is a very good film. I also believe that it is a very misunderstood film. I'm glad I didn't see the longer version, and I'm sure there's very good reason why Gallo edited it down. It makes the story more emotionally compact and easier for repeated viewings. With that said, there really isn't much to the plot of the film. A man loses a race and then heads west to race again. On the way he encounters a few females to try and make connections, consequently losing interest. When he arrives to his destination, he realizes that perhaps coming back to the place where his past haunts him may not have been a great idea. This is a film about standing up to your personal demons, confronting the past if you will. The ending was, for me, totally unexpected. I do not feel as though it was just tacked on, as many have claimed. This is independent film making at it's pinnacle. I'm sure many will disagree with this review, but I stand by what I say. As for Gallo, way to go. You have made a very emotionally raw film. Forget the critics, they know not what they see, obviously.",The Brown Bunny

56,screamingfoot,"Vincent Gallo as ""Bud Clay""...",8,6 March 2007,"I finally watched this movie a few days ago for the first time. I was expecting crap based on ALL the stuff I heard and read.The Brown Bunny is not crap.Vincent Gallo is a guy who loves to see himself on screen. He's an actor. He's got a big ego and it shows. Fine. I have come to realize that Gallo somehow makes very personal films without them being about himself.This film has a sort of overwhelming vibe of the mundane, the lonely, and the forgotten that is successfully carried through the entire narrative but at the same time, is a hipster's idea of everyday normalcy among the ""regular people."" I really like the story here. It's a good story if a you can calm your synapses enough to fall into the flow and follow the lead character's journey. There IS a ""payoff"" so to speak.My issues with this film stem mainly from the casting of the lead.Vincent Gallo is NOT a ""Bud Clay."" Sorry. He's just not. I find it hard to buy this VERY exotic, swarthy, Italian looking guy (with blue eyes) as someone with a name like ""Bud Clay,"" who is portrayed as a character who IS as mundane as his name. That casting just doesn't ring true, I'd say, and come to think of it, Gallo as ""Billy Brown"" with his hipster wardrobe in Buffalo, New York was a stretch in ""Buffalo '66"" also.I believe Gallo is a true artist whose ego overwhelms his choices as a filmmaker to some degree.",The Brown Bunny
57,mcshortfilm,A confused ego-maniac,5,31 July 2005,"I can respect any filmmaker that steers away from typical Hollywood conventions. It's not hard for a minimalist film to look so enticing when the majority of films produced are laced with big budgets of eye candy and formulaic plots.The Brown Bunny should be admired for its risky non-narrative style. It caused furious reactions at the Cannes film festival which obviously helped generate lots of press and attention. Fans of the avante-garde will have to think ""Oh! Its one of those films! The critics didn't get it. It must be ahead of its time!"" That may be true but what's unsettling about the reviews is that they influenced director Vincent Gallo to cut the film in half leaving it more concise and marketable for mass audiences. Well I don't like to form opinions based on unnecessary gossip but I can't help but be bothered by it. If Gallo were a visionary filmmaker why would he drastically re-edit a film just after its premiere? I know this has happened many times with other directors but there is a part of me that has a hard time taking Gallo seriously. It's not his acting. I can see he has a quality that is rare and unique to most other contemporaries. His beautiful acting range is evident in his previous film ""Buffalo 66"". I just sense from his egocentric attitude of being the star, writer, director, producer and the fact that he's in 95% of every shot in the film, that he is just being creatively oblivious.Most artists will tell you that self-portraits are the most difficult subjects to tackle because they involve erasing your preconceived notions about who you think you are to showing how everyone knows who you are. Nobody said that ""The Brown Bunny"" is autobiographical but it certainly feels personal. This film reminded me of Dennis Hopper's ""The Last Movie"", an unfinished existential sequel to the 1969 film ""Easy Rider"". Hopper and Gallo seem similar in their egos and their American cowboy persona's but there seems to be a void here. I'm not sure a longer movie would be the answer. All I know is that Vincent Gallo's character Blake should look more pathetic and less cool to his audience. I may see this again and see something different. For now, I am tired of seeing another road movie that really looks rehashed and broken down for its artistic value. This just doesn't feel self conscious. It feels clueless and arrogant.",The Brown Bunny
58,emilywes56,on his work,8,21 February 2020,"The critics and festivals are so ignorant about this film. Both films by Vincent Gallo, Buffalo '66 and the Brown Bunny are two very delicate, sensitive works that except everything else, adore the female gentleness and innocence. I guess, the public opinion makers do not really believe what they say, they are just mad.. mad that he does everything on his own.
This film is being ""analyzed"" in a superficial way, from those who claim that they understood the film. Gallo is making a very personal cinema for his own demons and memories of his past life experiences. I admire his courage to do so and I anticipate more of his sincere view on these difficult subjects.",The Brown Bunny

I think 2/3 of the movie is the main character standing on a doorstep or fueling a van and the other 1/3 is bad. Really bad. Laughably bad. If I were entering a festival called ""Most pathetic attempt at filmmaking on a $500 budget"" I would want this as my entry. No script, no plot, no logic, no point. I could see this as a benchmark in movie making where a judge might sentence a convict to watch this as part of their punishment. Other than that. steer clear my friends. I forgot about ""The Art of Self Defense"" LOL. That also earned 1 star for a different, but no less excruciating, horrible, 90 minutes.",The Brown Bunny
60,captain-54,Do not see this movie,2,28 August 2006,"You should not see this movie, and I'm not kidding.Now, I've said it, let me say this. There was an excruciating excitement in watching something that, right from the beginning, you knew was going to be one of the messiest, stinkiest turds you've seen. I accepted that and lived within it gloriously.There was somewhat of a payoff with a semi-good sex scene near the end and a semi-twist that lent you some insight into how this could have been a good movie.To finish up, however, if anyone offers to have you watch this film, only watch the last five minutes. If they insist you watch the whole thing ""for context"", then kill them. Do not run away, they may trick someone else into watching this, you have to put them down.",The Brown Bunny
61,Trajanc,Outstandingly bad.,1,4 June 2003,"Already a mild sensation for being maybe one of the worst received films in the history of Cannes, The Brown Bunny lives up to the hype; it is one excruciatingly bad film. Pointless, self-indulgent, inconsistent, misdirected and awesomely dull. A meandering, poorly shot and pointless road trip set to a totally inappropriate score, monomaniacally centered on a character who has nothing to offer. It even manages to make fellatio look boring. I saw this on a tape where a little bit of the edges of the picture were cropped but I don't think that made any difference. One of the worst films I have seen in a long time. Unfortunately, it's not even entertainingly bad.",The Brown Bunny
62,hawksburn,A confusing torrent of emotions,8,28 February 2006,"I rented this film purely out of curiosity, given the extremely divergent views I'd read on it. Some praised it for its depth of feeling and abstract photography, others condemned it for its pretentious attitude & dislocated narrative. I needed to judge for myself.What I found was that as I went thru the film my feelings were as divergent at different points as the critics. Lets start by saying my pre-conceived notion would be that I'd hate the film but I'd have to watch it first to qualify that judgment. Strangely enough I'd go from complete dislike and confusion for a period to absolute entrancement the next. There are many points along the journey where I consider the character a complete and total misogynist loser, and then again there are just moments of beautiful raw emotion where he is frankly, if not redeemed, then understood better.I guess where the threads come together is, quite naturally, at the ending. But what an ending. During the entire duration you're taken on this confused and sad lonely ride of torment and loneliness, seemingly bewildered by the series of events and occurrences, then this revelatory ending king-hits you in the plexus. The resulting sex act is but a symptom of his distress and anyone who confuses it with gratuitous titillation for the sake of it is completely missing the point as far as I'm concerned. He loathes himself for not having saved her, for not having what could have been, for living a life spent restlessly drifting from one race to another and probably never connecting with anyone on any sort of level again.Obviously this film isn't for everybody as it attracts the whole gamut of criticism from delight to derision. Maybe it only suits those who are naturally deeply introspective. Still if you hate it you hate it and I'm not here to change your mind. As I stated, I was prepared to despise it but instead I came away from it feeling very differently.",The Brown Bunny
63,PseudoFritz,Not Worth the Time,2,9 September 2004,"This is not a feature film; it is a 15-minute short with 75 minutes of prologue appended to it.The scene with Daisy was OK, apart from the fact that the dialogue was so low that I couldn't understand half of what was being said. It had a payoff, but the ""twist"" wasn't particularly shocking or revelatory; any 12-year-old kid could have come up with the same thing for a creative writing assignment.The biggest problem is that the first hour-plus was just INTERMINABLE. Even in those few instances when Bud interacted with other people, it was painful waiting for them to get to the point, and the ""points"" that were gotten were of minuscule value. During that first 75 minutes I was struggling with the urge to walk out, but I figured that SOMETHING had to happen eventually...I'm glad that I waited, because I thought that the one scene was done reasonably well, but my recommendation to anyone else would be to enter the theater an hour after the posted start time.My advice to Vincent Gallo would be a paraphrase from ""Life in Hell"": ""You do what you do reasonably well, Mr. Gallo, but now you must ask yourself, 'Is it worth doing?'""",The Brown Bunny

I don't feel good anymore. because I watched it so much. have you heard about the movie...never mind. That is a long story.

Too bad I can't say the same about The Brown Bunny, a flick that is as much fun as watching dry paint just BE. Gallo looks miserable as a bike racer driving cross country to California, in his way, he meets ugly girls, briefly hooks up with them, then he cries, then drives and cries and drives some more and when he makes it home, gets some head from Chloe Sevigny, alright I saw this at the theater and I could swear that when the infamous oral scene was played I heard some zippers, well get unzipped and that was disturbing, one really has to watch the whole movie to understand what it is about and where the character comes from, the thing is there is no pay off in The Brown Bunny.",The Brown Bunny

I got to briefly talk to him before I went in and watched it, and he was very humble and pleasant. The film itself was pretty good, while I didn't mind long takes, the theater made the experience a bit uncomfortable to sit in silence for long periods of time, perhaps it would be better to watch on DVD. I don't see what all the fuss is about; it's a decent film and I certainly didn't think much of the ""infamous"" scene--it was part of the story, and it belonged in the film, end of story. After the movie Gallo did a quick Q&A and then showed a clip from Ebert&Roeper where they were trashing the film--good for a quick laugh. Glad he's got a sense of humor. Dunno if you MUST see it in the theater, but I'll get it when it comes out on DVD.",The Brown Bunny

Well, watch this movie and you'll understand exactly how they feel.About 2/3rds of the film is alternating views of a driver (Vincent Gallo) and the views through the windscreen as he heads across America. To be fair, he does sometimes stop to refuel or say the occasional few taciturn words to girls. He even washes his face quite a few times! Everything is done ""real time"" as Gallo obviously doesn't understand the meaning of the word ""edit"".Finally, he meets up with a former girl-friend for some explicit oral sex, after which there is a simple short story told in flashback. Then it's back to the road.This would have been a fairly interesting 15-minute short but terminal boredom sets in long before the story gets underway. The biggest surprise is how an actress of Chloe Sevigny's quality was talked into performing fellatio on-screen. She must have thought the film had some artistic merit but sadly she was wrong.",The Brown Bunny

I love independent film, and I consider myself capable of understanding depth, and artistic vision, but this movie was just plain BAD. I hate to agree with the fat man from TV, but I think watching his colonoscopy would have been more interesting, maybe we would have seen Lemmiwinks, who knows. Seeing that gerbil, would have still been more exciting than the Brown Bunny.I know that Vince Gallo thinks he's deep, and profoundly interesting, but I think this film just failed to make any important points, other than just keeping a camera running while you go through your typical day, is only interesting if your Bill Clinton in a room full of interns. Watching a middle aged man drive, ride a motorcycle, get dome, take a shower, and drive some more, is just not that ""arty"". If we determine that it is, please send the film crew over to my house, I'll make the greatest art film ever.I used to think that I was deep, open minded, intelligent and possible even a little arty, until I watched this ""important film"".

70,redcup,Vincent Gallo cinematic rebel,10,21 November 2008,"Vincent Gallo is a talented actor and director that will be remembered by movie fans for years. The Brown Bunny is way ahead of it's time and place in cinema. The story is about pro motorcycle racer Bud Clay played by Vincent Gallo. Bud carries around personal demons that make him miserable. His career stalls until he decides to head to California to race. Along the way he meets a needy woman and equally tortured soul played by Chloe Sevigny.Both look for comfort with each other. It doesn't work because Bud is in love with a woman from his past. The Brown Bunny has a masterful part where Bud and this woman are in a rundown seedy motel getting intimate. I was shocked to see actual oral sex performed by Chloe Sevingy on Vincent Gallo. The sexual act was not sexy at all. Looking deeper it was a sad part of the movie because these characters were trying to escape like an addict looking for a fix. Either seemed to be enjoying themselves. Vincent Gallo should be praised for this movie. It's a emotional and haunting story. John McCain and Sarah Palin called themselves mavericks.

72,ZOMBlE,The Brown Lump,1,10 December 2007,"To simply call this pretentious mess ""vile"" is an understatement, and to call Vincent Gallo a ""filmmaker"" is ludicrous. This is without doubt the most unforgivable and narcissistic drive-forever-and-go-nowhere/home porno movie ever conceived, and Gallo's parents must be ashamed of themselves. I feel sympathy and disgust that Chloe Sevigny would allow herself to stoop so low (pun intended) without an ounce of self-respect for herself or for the viewer. Gallo's -- and Sevigny's excuse, calling this an ""art"" film is utter rubbish. Brown Lump -- er, Brown Bunny is little more than an excuse for Gallo to point the camera at himself for what seems like hours on end, until time comes to lower it to his genitals, so Chloe can perform an impressive Linda Lovelace imitation.As to the pathetic cretins who seem to enjoy this kind of garbage, what can I say, to each his own; even if it's watching narcissistic racists (read Gallo's personal website where he tried to sell his sperm; look for ""not interested in women with dark skin,"" and ""free insemination for women with Aerian features whose fathers fought for Germany in WWII"".

73,SoHo1,"Dull, purposeless",4,2 March 2005,"Vincent Gallo is an artist. I know he's a painter, singer, actor, director, producer and whatever. I really like him for being so versatile and so expressive, but I think there must be some flaws relating to his approach in movie-making. I know he's eccentric, peculiar or whatever but I'd really appreciate if he tried to make some more sense when making movies. The Brown Bunny is a tapestry of his idiosyncrasy with nerve-wrenching idiocy. He tries to venture out of the mainstream film-making but if he exerted himself just a little bit more he could really make his works more comprehensible and down-to-earth. Well, I will attribute my annoyance to my not being a professional and my not being able to percept the profundities of art BUT still, I think movies are made for wider audiences and not only seasoned film craftsmen or ""Rogerebertian"" movie critics. I have seen Buffalo '66 of Vincent Gallo and though wearisome, it was lovable and interesting. It precisely showed Gallo's inclinations toward something new and uncommon.

I wouldn't recommend taking Grandma to this movie, although I saw a couple of ladies in their seventies at the theater I saw it in. Worth a second look. Chloe Sevigny shows what a real trooper she is, I saw her in Gummo and she tends to be in oddball movies like this one and that is why I like her so much.

75,matt-szy,a brave film. a subtle study of loneliness. cock and balls. Gallo: a visionary artist.,10,25 May 2006,"A lots been written about this film. It's controversial. It's pretentious. It's the best American film ever. It is art. It's an ad by and for V. Gallo, himself and his cock. And in terms of film, according to what I am learning at film school, this is a disastrous film. It has little to no conflict between characters. Little telling dialogue. Long shots of nothing, and ears, and hair, and bathroom stalls. Its out of focus at times. And on and on. But lets not get caught up with what others have done, the conventions of film, and what defines film for most people today when viewing this film. This film stands alone. It is an ode to loneliness and longing done in a very personal way. It is slow and subtle. At times there is no music and only the view of roads approaching through a dirty windshield. In these times I feel like I am in a car with friends, something so common, driving somewhere, stuck in my thoughts, as the scenery moves by me. The experience is no longer about watching a film... it turns into a subconscious self exploration from the view of Gallo, something closer to an emotional voyage. Other times music is playing and we see Gallos face, all sad and tormented. These shots last a long time. Sometimes very long. The person who must be grounded in established film conventions, afraid to let go of learned and programmed biases about film and art and life, at this point of the film will have trouble letting go of those things and just going along with this unusual experience. They will say this is ridiculous, this is weird, nothing is happening, the more intellectual ones they will mention how unmotivated these shots are, this dialogue and how minimal it is. But those kinds of people are stuck looking backward, still amazed by the invention of the wheel, still looking for the deeper imaginary meaning of things. The film Brown Bunny is an expressions of freedom, an ode to art, devoid of any acknowledgment and references to things already done. It is visionary. It is new and fresh and shocking and unexpected. But people like Gallo, making films like Brown Bunny, unfortunately cannot be appreciated by everyone. It is just not possible due the the norms and guidelines and status quo set by the majority and followed by most. It is simply too difficult to go against conventions so deeply rooted in society, and it is too difficult to just go out and do whatever you want and then be appreciated for it. But Gallo does it with this film. This is what real artists do. They go against everything to say what they want to say. People fear these kinds of things, they cringe at the thought, they scratch their knuckles with unease. With Brown Bunny, Gallo abandons norms and is not hindered by todays film conventions - he is an artist telling a poetic and personal story called Brown Bunny. Having seen this film I'm uplifted with a sense of intrigue and awe, and hope that things like this are made. I recommend everyone see this film, even if you are scared to accept such shocking and new and unfamiliar things, at least you will see what it means to be free thinking and unconcerned with norms. 10 out of 10, easy.

The movie goes on like this (just him driving across the country) for 75% of the film. Very little dialog or other actors. The only reason, I give it 2 stars is for the beautiful photography and for the ""idea"", which COULD have been a good 10 minute short. The sex scene was totally gratuitous and simply meant to shock us. It could have been edited properly and still had the impact with only a quick shot or two of her ""performing the deed"" without focusing in on the act as long as it did.

The only two scenes worth watching are the ones at the Bonneville Salt Flats because it is quite haunting and of course, the one which comes at the climax and made this movie infamous. Obviously, there is no need for it whatsoever so my hunch is that this was the only way for Gallo to ""get some"" and some more from his actress. We also find out how Sevigny performs ""orally"".

No you won't find the usual Hollywood tropes, but the finished product feels indulgent to the utmost. Better editing would have helped but cut the movie far too short.

This film can be appreciated when taken on its own terms. It's rich, beautiful, subtle, and profound. I'd heard only about the infamous oral scene, and tales of what a hateful hipster Gallo is, and therefore initially had no interest in Brown Bunny. But I saw it in the DVD store and decided to give it a shot. As said, it could have used a bit more editorial pruning--and it did require me to will myself to be patient and keep an open mind--but I'm glad I made it through. It's definitely not for everyone.

87,victorboston,"He's so EDGY man, you should check him out, he makes CINEMA...",1,15 March 2011,"Vincent Gallo has a reputation. He makes movies that are for a lack of a better word, different, and as such, they find their way into the thought-o-sphere, where everyone forgets what makes Gallo's movies different, and the uninitiated walk away with the sense that Gallo makes real art that really is worth seeing, It's not. I promise you.As I have seen Buffalo 66, I was prepared for the badly written dialogue and for the inordinately lengthy shots, suggesting, perhaps, that one can reach nirvana by losing one's self in the contemplation of Vincent Gallo's brooding forehead. What I was not prepared for was the sheer intensity of Mr. Gallo's narcissism. Whatever fundamental truth he may think he is conveying drowns with little more than a pathetic whimper, leaving in it's wake only the understanding that Gallo loves seeing himself on film, and that we should all love seeing him there too.I get the sense that Gallo thinks he is like Antonioni - a master of capturing mood and the complex emotions of his subjects through minimal dialogue and vivid visual composition. He is not. The effect is that he doesn't know how to write and can't think of where to point his camera.Oh yeah, and the controversy, the other hook to get college students looking for a cinematic rush to rent this crap from Netflix - if a movie is controversial it must be worth seeing right? Despite the desperate attempts to make the audience connect with his character, and to make sex a potent symbol,the climactic scene has the emotional depth of a cheap porno.This is a bad movie.

And while the artsy crowd may enjoy just that: watching -- watching as the main character, Clay (Gallo), drives cross-country, aimlessly and endlessly for what seems like an eternity, there's just not enough substance to The Brown Bunny to make for anything other than a self-indulgent exercise from a once promising director. Sure, the shock value in the last minutes is, well, shocking, but is it enough to justify our suffering along with the main character through the rest of the film? Do yourself a favor: if curious to find out what all the fuss is about, fast forward your DVD on screen (8x setting should be fine) for roughly the first hour and ten minutes. Stop every once in a while to feel artsy and appreciate the ennui. Net result: you watch the movie in about one quarter the time. Trust me. You won't miss anything. As for the end?

Driving across country by yourself is boring enough, but watching someone else drive across country alone is even more boring! There was only 10 lines of dialog in the movie. The camera angles were strange and the music was so depressing I wanted to slit my wrists. I think what bothered me more than the endless driving, was how these women seemed to think that he was a ""hot boy"". They would just randomly go with him although he looked and acted like a crazy person.

Gallo is a brilliant filmmaker for sure but after reading the credits posted on IMDb I realize he may have more talent and energy than most other humans. THE BROWN BUNNY very much entertained and moved me. Still, after reading the hateful comments here, I feel the writers of these hate comments clearly are not displaying sophistication, intelligence or any love for movies. Everyone can say what they want but boy do the haters here say it crudely and simple minded. Sad to read this type of stuff about any film especially this one. I PRAY FOR GALLO TO HAVE A LONG LIFE AND MAKE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ORIGINAL FILMS IN SPITE OF THE LOW CLASS COMMENTS POSTED HERE. Further still, the venom and spew posted by such ordinary people regarding the film THE BROWN BUNNY is certainly a sign Gallo has made something important and great !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",The Brown Bunny
92,rutger19,memorable movie,9,11 September 2005,"The Brown Bunny is a very hard movie to watch. Lots of silent scenes and lots of periods in the scenes when nothing is happening. But this is not a weak part of the movie. If you watch the whole movie, you realize that the silences really add to the suspense. Gallo plays Bud in a great role. He is so plagued by pain that it is uncomfortable and confronting. He just cannot forgive himself for losing the one girl he really loved; Daisy. He cries, approaches other women, rides his bike, sees prostitutes, but they do not match up to Daisy. Everything he does, he falls into a deeper depression with a final breakdown in a hotel room in a dreamlike sequence.The plot of the movie is very powerful and can only be felt by those undergone similar love ache (plot is not written down here as a spoiler!). Gallo gives away one of the best acting experiences I have seen in years. Even though most critics rate this movie as bad. I can only hope Gallo will go on making more movies, not necessarily the same, but just as interesting.Oh and the blow job scene is indeed a bit like porn, but I don't care. Chloe Sevigny is also good as Daisy.",The Brown Bunny
93,ftdata,A haunting story told almost wordlessly,10,8 October 2005,"I watched ""Brown Bunny"" then re-watched key parts. I regard it as one of the more artistic honest film plays I have ever seen.(And I am not faulting the oft-cited sex seen between writer/director/cameraman Vincent Gallo and actress Chloe Sevigny. In a time in which the most recent national survey of American teenagers shows that more than half those 15-19 years of age have practiced fellatio or cunnilingus, and that among those 18-19 years of age, this number climbs to almost 70%, both kinds of oral sex must be regarded as normative non-coital practices. Sort of an intense version of kissing.) The root of this story, its theme and its plot, is the intense loneliness of Bud Clay, whom some observers have seen as the Brown Bunny, rather than his Honda racing motorcycle. He communicates this loneliness not only in his expressions or lack of them as he drives across the American continent in search of his lost, discarded or dead Daisy (depending on your interpretation of their final conversation). Every nuance of his actions or lack of them, and in his sparse questions and answers with others bespeaks the loneliness I describe here, a loneliness not requited by Bud's brief contacts with anything or anyone else in the story, including Daisy herself.It probably would have been wiser of Gallo not to have engaged in a public slinging of written nastiness with Roger Ebert, the premium critic of American film. But it is to the credit of Gallo's integrity not to have stepped back from this battle. Mr Ebert is paid to criticize or laud films as he sees fit. But Mr Gallo has the right and perhaps the obligation to defend his own artwork.Yes, I would like to see more of his films. And Ms Sevigny already is an established and powerful actress, especially in the artistically rewarding world of independent films, to which many of us pay court by our viewing attendance.Well done.Arnold Harris Mount Horeb WI",The Brown Bunny
94,neoo,Somebody shoot the bunny,3,13 September 2003,"THE BROWN BUNNY WRITTEN DIRECTED AND EDITED BY VINCENT GALLODIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY VINCENT GALLOPerhaps Vincent Gallo was trying to make the ultimate road movie. Showing in real time the weariness of cycle rider Bud Clay on the road  going from one race where he lost to the next one across the country. Endless tedious sideshots of Clay driving or shots through the front windshield on the countless miles of highway driving by day or night. The small bits of actual human interaction prove unsatisfying and spark little relief from the monotony of the drive. Whether he be washing his face in a motel bathroom or pumping gas, the whole look of the film is minimal. Whether it be low budget or shot deliberately this badly, the film almost wastes the one performance by Chloe Sevigny which made waiting for the end of the movie almost bearable. The whole film could have been been trimmed by 85 minutes to spare the viewer the effort if all that would be drawing the interest is that two minute scene people might have heard about. It is actually the least interesting bit in the movie. At least this movie is not twentynine palms.",The Brown Bunny

This guy drives around in his truck and occasionally makes the odd stop to make out with a strange girl or browse a pet store. I can't for the life of me ascertain how this can be considered art by some ""critics"".The lighting is bad; the camera work is shoddy at best; the plot doesn't exist and mostly involves of close-ups of Vincent's head or the road in front of him; the sound is bad and at times you can't even hear what the actors are saying (in particular Chloë Sevigny in the hotel room scene).The movie is an absolute waste of time. One boring, arbitrary shot after the other. Oh, there's a graphic bj scene in the end. Big deal. Sevigny was never that hot, nor a particular important actress. And the ending? So she's dead! Woohoo!

With simple camera shots and dirty road-movie-aesthetics, few dialogue and non- linear editing and narration we are shown what cinema is capable of: we drift along with a not even truly sympathetic character. And we do not understand his intentions until the last revealing sequence of the film. But then our emotions explode in retrospective on the seemingly uneventful journey we've watched over the last 80 or so minutes. Suddenly the whole tragedy of the protagonist is revealed and his journey makes sense. To me, THE BROWN BUNNY manages what IRREVERSIBLE fails to show: the raw emotions and the mind's confusion of a mourning and conscious-stricken man.",The Brown Bunny

Yes, Gallo has had many reports written on him saying that he is the mostegotistical person in film making today, but meeting him after his show inLondon a few weeks back he was willing to chat about where his film wasplaying and even accept a cd of my own music with great humbleness.

99,raoulfenderson,Bogglingly Bad,1,18 August 2005,"I really wish Roger Ebert hadn't ""changed his mind"" and actually *recommended* this woofer after previously calling it the worst movie he'd ever seen at Cannes. According to Rog, the editing did the trick. Gallo supposedly left a substantial portion of the Cannes version on the cutting room floor. Too little, too late, in my humble opinion. One day, and very soon, the critics who had anything good to say about this film will see the error of their ways; they will repent in sackcloth and ashes, and the entire production will be eternally damned and consigned to the sulphurous, unquenchable flames of cinema hell.A lot of people post comments on a lot of movies here, and quite often you read the comment, ""This is the worst film I've ever seen."" I don't want to be one of those people. It's so, well, trite. And usually not true. People just like to blow off some steam. So instead I'll just say that this is a tedious, ghastly, juvenile, inexpressibly awful display of utter dreck.I tried desperately to find one reason, just one tiny little miniscule reason, to rate this movie higher than rock-bottom. But I can't. In fact, if there were a ""zero"" rating, I would have to check with someone at IMDb to be sure that ""zero"" means what I think it means, i.e., totally, absolutely, irrevocably devoid of even a quark's worth of value -- and, having confirmed this, I would devote the remainder of my mortal sojourn upon this earth searching for an even LOWER rating for ""Brown Bunny."" You have been warned. And if you're just gonna rent this on DVD to scan to that one scene we've all heard about, do yourself a favor and rent a porno instead. Any porno. Maybe one of those series like ""Euro Sluts 20"", or whatever. The production values, acting, dialogue, and especially the sound, I guarantee will be far superior to anything you'll ""come across"" in ""Brown Bunny.""",The Brown Bunny
100,smithwarrick,this film really got to me...,9,7 January 2007,"I watched this movie by myself, curtains closed, it was during the day. My wife wasn't interested in watching it. I kind of guessed this wasn't really a ""group"" film anyway. I had seen Vincent Gallo in a few films before this one, including his flawed but interesting first feature Buffalo 66. I thought of him as an emotional and intense actor, but whose characters he plays can tend to waffle on and on. Especially one he was in with Courtney Cox, I can't remember the name of that one but I didn't like it.I was in the mood for a slow film that you just sit back and let it just wash over you... and this film did that beautifully.Vincent Gallo has a real talent for capturing film ""moments"" and the attractive nature of stillness. In scenes like when he talks to Violet in the gas station, my eyes stayed on his gaze at Violet as he repeated saying ""please"", his desperation and sadness was totally engaging. His interaction with the woman at the rest stop, unusual but beautiful.Yeah, those shots of the POV driving went for a long time, but I liked the music so hey!The film flowed beautifully and engagingly towards its devastating climax, which I agree wouldn't of had as much impact had I known its revelations. I really appreciated the 70's style documentary look in the flashbacks, made the scenes even more heartbreaking. The oral sex scene deepened the emotionally uncomfortable feeling the film gave me, and I think was totally justified in being so graphic in the film. I could really feel for the character of Bud Clay by the films end. Throughout the film you got a sense there was a strong reason for his inability to relate and commit, but the denouncement really made it hit home.This is going to sound corny, but this is true. After watching the film, I hugged my wife. In a subversive way, this film encouraged me to appreciate more what I had at home.",The Brown Bunny

Although Gallo's own fault (advertizing the picture with huge billboards that showed the fellatio-act), it's unfair The Brown Bunny will always be remembered for that one, pornographic scene. Besides of the fact that the pornographic scene is so extremely important for the dramatic development near the end, the film has so much more to offer. The sadness, the roads, the landscapes, the soundtrack, this film is TRANCE in capital letters. Gallo is a talent, highly underrated because of his impossible behaviour, but probably without his controversial, impossible behaviour this film would never have been made.

103,crawl-2,Gallo whine,4,4 September 2005,"First, the sex scene. I thought that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman would be the first stars to put their sex on screen in ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Not simulated, but real. I enjoyed seeing the sex here put into the context of the story. It belies the moral monsters who simply say it's bad in any context. The story could have continued here without the sex, but it made a very clear point within the context of the story. People ""make love"" all the time in other films, but you are never to see the 'real deal' so the moral monsters can feel like they won. Hurray to Gallo for putting a real sex scene in a movie to continue the 'real feel' of the movie. That is the only positive thing I will say about the movie.I loved ""Buffalo 66"", which was quirky, funny and poignant. But each of Gallo's films make sure you know that it's all about Vincent. First and foremost, he must take you into a story that features his constant moping, greasiness, and always about Vincent. Can he do a story where he is a minor character? No. Why does he think that endless scenes of roads can't tell the story of despair without....10 minutes of endless road scenes? More indulgence. He treats the viewer like a moron and after awhile you ARE a moron for waiting 90 minutes to have anything resembling dialog and anything other than a guy with a camera and a hard-on for the viewer.",The Brown Bunny

But the vitriol that flowed after was unjust and I couldn't help feeling that if some great European master had made exactly the same movie we'd all be finding elegiac metaphors and existential analogies hidden within the subtext (if there was any text that is!) THAT scene with Sevigny is not exactly worth waiting for and you do leave the theatre with the empty feeling of having just watched a two hour documentary of the wheel revolutions on a racing bike.

On the other hand, if you enjoyed ""Two-Lane Blacktop"", ""Five Easy Pieces"", or ""Vanishing Point"", and have the intellectual capacity to enjoy 90 minutes of thought-provoking cinema - you might just enjoy this film. Once again, Vincent Gallo rewards the audience with truth in cinematography. He's driving cross-country to try and reclaim his one true love, with minor detours along the way. In any Hollywood road trip movie there are bound to be shots through the windshield of the family vehicle. The difference between Hollywood's road trip, and Vincent Gallo's trip across America is that Vincent leaves the bugs on the windshield! Show me one Hollywood film that does that. Along with the windshield realism we get to enjoy the emotional realism of a man who isn't ready to give up his dream of true love, yet who unsuccessfully attempts to replace it along the way. Much has been made of the sexual exploits in the film, but opposed to the ridiculous and unrealistic episodes of ""Desperate Housewives"", these scenes look and smell like truth.",The Brown Bunny
106,Stonyc75,I think he got away with it..,1,10 April 2020,"A decade ago I happened upon 'The Brown Bunny' on netflix, a film I'd never heard of, let alone seen any trailers for, but having quite liked 'Buffalo '66' I gladly decided to give Vincent another whirl.And well, where does one begin? I suppose as good a place as any would be the beginning, in which a man (played by Vincent) sets off in a van to find his long lost love; leaving this reviewer at least to anticipate what unfortunate tangents could befall this man's simple desire to get from A to B. I'll admit I was optimistic. But what separates this picture from the more traditional, orthadox standard of film making is that he isn't, in fact, befallen by 'any' unfortunate tangents. Instead he just drives, in silence, unhindered, until eventually reaching the middle of the film, pulling a motorbike outta the back and going for a burn up. He then returns to the van and eventually bumps into Cheryl Tiegs in a layby, where they mumble a bit and get off with each other before our hero jumps back in his van, remembering to look moody and serious at all times, before finally reaching his destination where Chloë Sevigny (his real life ex girlfriend, I believe) provides him with oral sex so awkward I had to watch through my fingers.Seriously though, was that it?Well, not so fast, nescient philistine! As though Vincent would hoodwink his own audience in such an arrogant, egotistical manner! For those of us cool, clever, smart and educated connoisseurs of the arthouse, who know better - it's obvious the film contains a much deeper, more ambiguous message; and is pulled together into what can only be described as a truly unforgettable life affirming experience - to whit, the deep, subtle, underlying allegorically nuanced reasoning behind the endless monotony of a bloke in a van for the preceeding 90 minutes, is that Chloë Sevigny is actually dead, okay? She's not really there - the really awkward fellatio scene was really in Vincent's imagination.So you see? The entire 92 minutes was basically Vincent Gallow, shall we say, 'self indulging' - and to be fair to the guy, he somehow got away with it - not that that raises the film any higher than it deserves.

On the somewhat tortuous road of life, professional biker Bud Clay just roams around the biker's circuit, unable to communicate with others. Bud is not only contemplating life nor does he have plans to kill himself. He tries to live. He talks to people that he meets on the road, he just doesn't seem to connect with them. There's something in his past that has just changed his perspective on things. How do you survive your mistakes? Can someone unbreak a window? Those are the questions Vincent Gallo invites us to answer, in a simple, sometimes even brisk way. Either you embark on his voyage or you don't.

I have been curious about this film for a long time because it was so loathed, but I never really knew why. I give it a tepid thumbs up.It's a very simple story of lost love and the search for redemption...well, girls with flower names, anyway. It was quite poetic and, contrary to what others have said here, had a great deal of personal cinematic style - if intentionally low-budget in look. (I loved that the scene where he knocks on Daisy's parents' door is shot from across the street.) And I loved that the road scenes put you in specific locales - no generic highways here.But the pacing is only for the brave - or European. Had it been a 45 minute short it would have been compelling. One wonders if anyone would be interested in this film at all were it not for the climactic scene in which the audience learns the heft and shape of Vincent Gallo's glans. Which is too bad, because there was the makings of an outstanding film here.An added note: The score was a typical indie-hip pastiche of songs with no dramatic thrust other than being sonic wallpaper over long spans where the story was at a halt.

111,DVDA_CHICK_19,Searching for a safe place and for the lost brown bunny...,10,30 December 2004,"THE BROWN BUNNY. Written and Directed By Vincent Gallo. Starring Vincent Gallo and Chloe Sevigny. **CONTAINS SPOILERS** Watching this film is like being stuck in the mind and journey of the main character Bud Clay for 93 minutes straight (or longer, but the film was cut shorter sadly) and feeling what he is going through at every minute as the film goes on. It's almost like your in the car with him looking out the window seeing the sights he sees on his way to Los Angeles. Bud Clay is finishing a motorcycle race, doing laps round and round, over and over. After the race he is leaving New Hampshire. He loads up his bike by himself in the back on his brown van getting ready for his long trip to Los Angeles, California. He's going to go back to his home he once shared with his girlfriend Daisy Lemon and to compete in yet another race which is in 5 days. On his way he interacts with 3 different ladies - all of which have names of various flowers. None of these girls can really compare to the true flower he adores, the one woman he will always be devoted to which is of course, Daisy. The first woman he comes across is Violet who is a young sweet American girl working at a gas station in the boonies... after he fills his gas tank, Bud begs her to come with him on the trip and she agrees without a lot of hesitation to leave everything behind. He drops her off at her parents place so she can get her belongings and while she's still inside, he takes off in his van. After this he takes a stop in his old neighborhood where he grew up with Daisy as a child... and he goes to her old house where her parents are still living. While he stops to have a chat with her elderly parents and goes on to tell a few memories... we notice a small bunny in a cage that hasn't grown at all since the last time Bud has seen it, which is Daisy's rabbit. Her parents claim to not remember Bud or even coming to visit him and Daisy a while ago in L.A. Bud leaves the house and we watch him drive and drive, we ride with him through the dark nights, and through the rainy days... we see him imagine Daisy is in the passenger seat of the van kissing him. The next woman he comes across while getting a soda at the machine is a middle aged woman who has the name Lilly in big letters written on her purse. She is sitting all alone at a picnic table eyeing up Bud as he gets out of his Van at the rest stop. He begins making out with her overpoweringly...of course, he doesn't stick around and pulls away from her, and continues on his way. As Bud is driving you can sense all his sadness through the simple shots of his face expressions and it's clear he's beyond precarious... Finally, he makes it to Las Vegas and picks up this prostitute with the name of Rose... he asks her to have lunch with him and buys her food at McDonalds, tells her to get out of the van and gives her some money and takes off once again. When he reaches L.A. he fixes up his bike and then goes to repeatedly knock on the door of the home that him and Daisy once lived which looks deserted. He places a note on the door telling her his location and what hotel he's staying at. He checks into the hotel and sits on the bed awaiting her arrival... suddenly we see lovely Daisy standing at the door and it all comes clean from there...Bud is upset with her and is very cold when she tries to comfort him. It's all clear he wants her more than ever but has this hate burning up inside for her for what she has done to him in the past when they were together and it's difficult for him to show her the right amount of affection. This leads to the big blow job scene that everyone gets so worked up over, I think the scene has a moral purpose and I actually think highly of it ... it's not a dirty pornographic scene but a perfect explanation for why he has such revulsion towards her. (do not read ahead if you don't want to know the ending!) They begin to discuss the past and Bud just cries out to her asking ""WHY"" she did what she did to him... it's painful to sit through, a whole flashback is revealed where everything that happened is exposed. Bud left Daisy at a party with 3 guys who raped her when she was high and unconscious... he saw this and didn't even make an attempt to try and stop it. He felt like he could never forgive her for getting wasted and seeing her with other these other men. Once he left her, there was no one left to help her and she choked. We realize that Daisy Lemon isn't actually alive, she arrived at the hotel room because it was a creation by Bud's own imagination... she is no longer by his side after this and Bud is laying on the empty bed all by himself. Perhaps he is still in a safe place with Daisy, his brown bunny, but only in his mind. Still no matter what, Bud Clay will remain lost the rest of his life without her. I give this film a 10/10 without a doubt... I think Gallo is one amazing man and I am proud of him for making such a brilliant and unique masterpiece, too bad people look down on it like they do.

113,cinefilia,The Brown Bunny is a radical American masterpiece,10,27 June 2004,"I had heard about the controversy surrounding The Brown Bunny (who hadn't?)--the feud with Roger Ebert, the graphic sex scene--so when I received an invitation to a press screening, I jumped at the chance to see what the trailer calls ""the most controversial American film ever made"". What the trailer and all the hype didn't prepare me for was the fact that The Brown Bunny could also be considered one of the most original American films ever made. In a time of overblown budgets and enormous productions with endless crew lists, Vincent Gallo has almost single-handedly made a concise, well-thought out, conceptual film--a poignant, touching love story. It's not often that a director's second film is more daring than his first--money, greed and Hollywood power seem too tempting to most and sophomore efforts usually represent the big sell out. Not so The Brown Bunny, not so Gallo the iconoclast. He manages to make a second film more interesting, more intimate, more revealing and more memorable than his first. And he manages to do it outside the system.Gallo's instincts as a director are spot-on. Not only does he pull from Chloe Sevigny the performance of her career, he also solicits from a cast of complete unknowns and non-actors (including Cheryl Tiegs) painfully believable performances. I have always thought his talents as an actor were underrated, but surely The Brown Bunny will provide him his due as Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer undergoing a breakdown while driving across the country. Simply put, Gallo as Bud is devastating. At one point during the film, I was so tense watching him fall apart that I realized that I had been holding my breath through the entire scene. When you stop to think that he is also directing himself and directing the photography, it's that much more impressive. I don't know how someone circumvents the Hollywood system to make a movie in this day and age, but it seems that Gallo has not only done that, but done it in a way that is memorable, haunting and visually stunning. This is a truly radical film made by a very courageous filmmaker, someone willing to tell a story, tell it honestly and suffer the consequences of his convictions. Pasolini would be proud.",The Brown Bunny

116,Gestalt,The patient viewer is rewarded,10,7 May 2006,"""Brown bunny"" is about loneliness beyond what most people will ever know, of the dreadful feeling that your life disastrously is over, but you still have to go on living somehow. While you watch this movie, you will not understand this. Chances are you will not understand very much at all, and be tempted to change the channel. That would be a mistake. One must have faith in the strange genius of Vincent Gallo and trust that he knows what he is doing, even when it seems that the film is going nowhere and taking forever to get there. It pays off. Not that you are going to feel good afterwards, but perhaps you will value what you have in your own life, however little that may be. I watch a lot of movies, but this is the only time in my adult age that I couldn't sleep afterwards - as the few and very understated plot elements were still falling into place, I felt as if I had witnessed a train crash, and couldn't stop thinking frightening thoughts of what a fragile thing our comfort and happiness is.The movie would not have worked if it had been faster paced, dropped hints along the way, or contained more than the bare rudiments of a story. In this particular case, a ""spoiler"" will really, totally spoil the film - this rare masterpiece has nothing in common with your average Saturday evening entertainment, it must be watched unhurriedly and without any pre-conceived ideas or expectations.",The Brown Bunny

The movie consisted of 5 minutes of watching guys on motorcycles driving around on a track, 65 minutes of a side view of a greasy haired guy driving through the country, about 5 minutes worth of dialog and about 5 minutes of Chloe Sevigny performing oral sex. The characters were completely no believable or real. There was no plot, no dialog, no emotion, the ""twist"" was pretty obvious. It was impossible to feel the ""pain"" of the main character because by about 10 minutes into the movie you just don't care. It was like he was on a road trip and just forgot to turn his camera off. JT",The Brown Bunny
118,fontainemoore,A potentially good film in serious need of professional editing,5,19 November 2006,"While I give the film kudos for a story that I didn't see coming, after the first few minutes of needless (and extremely boring) motorcycle racing, I could see that I was NOT in the hands of a professional editor. The story could have been told far more effectively in half the time--or less. Gallo definitely needed to step away and let a professional editor do his/her thing and mercilessly cut scenes that didn't move the story forward.While I could see that the author wanted the audience to crawl inside the protagonist, Bud, during the road trip, it didn't take that darned long to do it. Plus, his point of view changed too frequently. If we are inside his skin, then why are we looking at him for minutes in an excruciatingly long and tedious long shot? We need to see what he sees--at least with more consistency. I couldn't get my bearings in terms of what I was supposed to be experiencing and from what viewpoint.There were other technical problems such as an inconsistency in lighting and shot quality with no apparent reason. And that spotted windshield drove me nuts. If a sign of depression and the carelessness that results from it, I'd have appreciated technique that didn't interfere so much with the visuals. Speaking of visuals, extending driving sequences to cover a song also seemed visually uninspired.Probably most important, Gallo ignored common expectations of audiences and wanted things his way. I can't believe there wasn't an acceptable compromise. I'm pretty patient when it comes to art and film as art, but don't appreciate my sensibilities and expectations to be pushed beyond the breaking point when there appears to be no artistic justification for it. Too many scenes suffered from too few cuts and ran far too long, engendering more audience frustration than heightened emotionalism. I think this may be a result of an inexperienced and slightly self-indulgent filmmaker.These technical problems aside, I'm usually able to spot a twist a mile away--but not this time. I wondered why all the women he encountered had flower names but that was just a hint that didn't make much sense until the end. But his name? Bud, as in ""flower bud"" and ""clay"" as in a substance in which flowers grow (he couldn't have named the character ""dirt"" or ""mulch,"" after all) might have been a bit over the top. Again, typical of an immature filmmaker.Was the encountered women's immediate sexual response to a complete stranger, fantasy on the character's part or the filmmaker's? I'd like to know how many men run into so many compliant females. From what I hear, not many--even when the guy is young, good-looking, and clearly pitiable. In this day and age, we ladies are a bit more cautious than that. Sorry, Vincent. While this may have been believable for males, I don't expect it was for very many female viewers.I watched the film largely because I wanted to see if and how graphic sex could be incorporated into a drama without lowering it to the level of ""high brow pornography."" I think the film did a good job on that score, although I'd have preferred the use of a realistic-looking prosthetic such as that used in Boogie Nights. Perhaps the budget didn't allow for it or...who knows? It was certainly an interesting artistic choice and one that leaves me scratching my head in terms of the motive for including it. Symbolically, I'm a bit confused about it.As effective and surprising as the end twist was, there could have been more in terms of Bud's descent into depression. But then, I'm a psychologist so am aware that symptoms are more than seeking surrogates, crying, and looking forlorn and depressed. Gallo missed, IMO, a chance to show more about what guilt and loss look like and how they affect people. Perhaps, this again, is a result of his inexperience. Personally, I think Redford's ""Ordinary People"" did a better job of showing a wider breadth of feelings of grief and loss.Bottom line, although I thought the story had merit and did an excellent job of building to a surprising twist, I think it suffered severely in the journey towards the denouement. I hope Gallo matures and grows as a storyteller and filmmaker as I think he's got something to say worth watching.",The Brown Bunny
119,kinrabe,"produces the emotions desired, but still too long",6,12 September 2007,"I fast forwarded through most of the film due to the incredibly long shots. The effects desired by the director are achieved: loneliness, alienation, a living Hell for the main character which becomes more clear with the final scenes. Because the film has artistic value, it is not porno even though it contains a real scene of fellatio. Sevigny is a good actress, always liked her, and I respect that she chose to do something daring and groundbreaking in puritanical America. I agree that this film should have been a short, and it would have been a good one. But I can't say it is a good film overall because Gallo cheats us with the long shots.

121,cinemafiendee,This movie is so cool.,2,3 October 2008,"This movie is interestingly bad. i wouldn't comment on this title if i hadn't just seen someone 'try' to 'pretend' they liked it, the only problem being that this person couldn't think of a reason to like this film, other than the fact that everyone else hates it. (The huge budget spent only on petrol, Chloe Sevigny's unnecessary blow job) Saying that the film is great because it's so bad that it stands out from the rest, thus making it 'good' is down-right-pretentious, and it makes for a funny read. This film has fifteen minute-long shots of race tracks (why not) which you are a champion if you can actually watch, plus great side-on shots of Vincent Gallo's face for another hour. I'm not bagging this film because it has 'boring' long shots, i enjoy Haneke and 'Silent Light' which has a sunrise from start to finish to begin the film, i just don't enjoy films that amount to nothing. If i was Vincent Gallos, i would say, ""sure, i would love to write, direct, produce and star in a film about me"" i would then proceed to ask Chloe Sevigny to give me a blow job. but i just wouldn't expect people to like it. there's nothing to understand. it's just an attempt at a character portrait which doesn't work because Vincent Gallos doesn't have to act. This movie is a great one to watch. it becomes a documentary about what what you can actually get onto a movie screen.

This movie is a poor attempt at film noire or creating a new genre for itself or something. The main guy is basically driving .. and driving... and driving with several stops along the way. I guess the constant driving is supposed to reflect his lost self and loneliness from a trouble past.The cut that I viewed: It's clearly missing flashbacks, even a controlled mili-second of snip bits to portray that something happened with this guy and his relationships to make him just drive ... and drive... and drive. It makes you wonder, who the f**k made this movie... it turns out its the main actor! Having said all this>>> Why the 6 still? and not a 2 or a 3? One of the last scene with Chloe when she hooks up again: one of the hottest scene in any movie, but strangely artistically done. The only point in the film in which you see a strong relationship.

If this film was done right with this scene, I could see why some people who saw this as 9 or a 10... and see it as a ten.however, an ""Unforgiven"" Clint Eastwood style of build, it is NOT..

124,hugodanner2002,A meditation on Love and Loss...,10,23 September 2005,"'The Brown Bunny' is the kind of independent art film that was always destined to polarise the opinions of critics and audiences alike. Gallo's controversial decision to incorporate a graphic hard-core oral sex scene between him and co-star Chloe Sevigny was interpreted by many as gratuitous and the film's modest pacing and minimalist plot inevitably alienated a large section of mainstream film-goers.'The Brown Bunny', which was written, directed, edited, produced and photographed by Vincent Gallo, is essentially an existential road movie that departs from traditional modes of narrative filmic communication. The film treads a similar thematic terrain to his directorial debut 'Buffalo 66' in that in both films the central protagonist is struggling to come to terms with certain events that have taken place in his past. However, in this film Gallo dispenses with his uniquely black sense of humour and with any real linear narrative in favour of providing a character study of a man deep in grief; carefully detailing every subtle nuance and trait of his increasingly pathological behaviour. The journey that Gallo takes us on is an entirely subjective one. Throughout the film, Gallo forces the spectator to scrutinise Bud and his facial expressions in extreme close-ups. We look on as Bud spontaneously breaks down and weeps within the confines of his van. The spectator is made to feel like a voyeur because what we are witnessing seems so personal and private. These extreme close-ups make two things clear: Firstly, Gallo is committed with the Brown Bunny to present Bud's state of mind visually and not by resorting to the traditional Classical Hollywood method of using dialogue or voice-overs. Secondly, they emphasise the impossibility of this task. Ultimately, we cannot tell how Bud is feeling simply by looking into his eyes or observing his facial expressions at close proximity. In this sense, Gallo also seems to be exploring the limits of the filmic image in representing a character's subjective mental state.Gallo's cinematography is characterised by an abundance of static shots, precise compositions and long takes that are all employed in a methodical manner, creating a slow and rhythmic pace that accurately evokes a pensive atmosphere of romantic grieving. His decision to shoot on Super 16mm film with a non-linear digital blowup to 35mm gives 'the Brown Bunny' the grainy visuals of Independent American cinema of the early seventies. It is difficult to fault Gallo's eye for aesthetic detail. Beautifully photographed shots of the open road and the picturesque American landscape are accompanied by the wistful and haunting melodies of folk artists like Gordon Lightfoot and Jackson C Frank. These incredibly evocative musical interludes serve to heighten the cathartic experience between the spectator and Bud, encouraging us not only to ponder the provenance of Bud's turmoil but also providing us with an opportunity to reflect on our own lives and loves. The film's major shortcoming is Gallo's blatant and overstated use of metaphor. We are left in doubt that Bud Clay is the proverbial bunny of the film's title. Gallo's symbolism is at its most contrived in a peculiar scene in which Bud randomly visits a pet store to inquire about the life expectancy of the rabbits. This notion of Bud as the symbolic bunny who only has a short time to live if he cannot re-establish his emotional equilibrium is again overtly reinforced visually through Bud's entire brown apparel in the film's final reel. The spectator's sense of voyeurism is sustained throughout the film and culminates in the penultimate fellatio fantasy sequence between Bud and Daisy which is beautifully bathed in speckles of blue light. Gallo ingeniously integrates icons of pornography into the narrative, which he then juxtaposes against his protagonist's feelings of insecurity, jealousy and guilt to formulate a scene that is both genuinely disturbing yet emotionally insightful. Far from being erotic or exploitation's, this scene marks Gallo's most significant achievement with 'the Brown Bunny'; a personal study of masculinity, masochism and the male ego. It is Bud's ego that initially leads him to view himself as the victim of the events surrounding Daisy's death by interpreting his pregnant girlfriend's brutal rape as an act of infidelity. His masturbatory fantasy explores the gulf between sex and intimacy in the context of a couple who have had their emotional ties severed. Bud makes a vein attempt to try and recapture the intimacy that he once shared with Daisy through an act of physical gratification. When he cannot find solace in this ritual and realises that it does not satisfy his emotional needs, he is forced to confront his own masculinity and that ultimately places him on another spiritual road to either redemption or suicide. Gallo deliberately leaves the ending wide open through his use of a final memorable freeze-frame. I admire any man who takes three years out of his life to single-handedly create a movie that he wholeheartedly believes in, no matter what the end result. As anyone in the industry will tell you, it's hard enough to get a terrible film made let alone a truly great one. 'The Brown Bunny' stands up as an undoubtedly brave and ambitious meditation on love and loss that, despite its flaws, retains a remarkably powerful cumulative effect.",The Brown Bunny

I have seen many horrible films,and this does NOT fall in the category of those: It's far too artistic and complex.The only reason people call it 'horrible' (I believe) is because of the slow-pace of the film,(it's like visual narration) ; Gallo's constant presence on-screen, and the sparse dialogue -(until the film's conclusion-which pummels you with words,so you have to keep with the rhythm!)The film visually tells the story.It is not for the casual movie viewer. I like films like that. It is deeply sensitive and mesmerizing.You have to be patient- very patient and let the story gradually unfold. Although you may think you know what the conclusion is as you watch,you still will be aghast.And I'm not referring to any 'shock value'at all.This is the sort of film that challenges the viewer in all aspects.It is not meant to dazzle or blow your senses away.It deals with human frailty,which a lot of people don't find 'entertainment.' It stirs up deep emotions of a tortured soul.I found Mr.Gallo's performance daring and ground-breaking, for it is so sensitive and fragile for a man to project.Like Roger Ebert said,""No man in Hollywood is gonna imitate the frailty in Gallo's voice as he pleads to a girl in a certain scene...""In conclusion I'd recommend this film highly for the sensitive,intelligent,artistic,patient film lover.The fact that Mr.Gallo doesn't relinquish his artistic vision for the mass audience is worthy of praise.As for the 'controversial scene'- make up your own mind.",The Brown Bunny

Buffalo '66 was a very good film, but this one isn't worth the cost of the film on which it's printed.While films with minimal dialog can be interesting, this one is just plain boring, painfully boring. Tedious shots of Gallo's character driving across country, punctuated by brief periods of him lying in bed.For me, the only interesting part of the film was the fellatio scene with Choe Sevigny.

127,vetapublishing,This is probably one of the worse film I have seen in the past 50 years,1,3 December 2006,"Vincent Gallo According to the credits is a man with many ( probably too many ) talents. While I haven't seen any of his other films, this one lacks a, direction. b, editing c, cinematography d, intelligent script. Vincent Gallo as an actor acts well as a depressed person, but that is all. When he brakes down with his former wife or girlfriend he utters a sound which could be credited to a whingeing cat, but hardly to a man which I suppose he represents. The repetitiousness of the scenes,his portraits in the mirrors show that as a director he admires himself as an actor, but I do not consider this as a positive.When I watched the first scene for about 15 minutes which is a motor circle race, I thought I put in the wrong DVD about motor cycle racing. I wished that I switched it off at that point. The rest of the film I watched for curiosity only. The sex scene sticks out from the film, like his prick from his trousers. It would fit into a porno film, but not what is considered an art-house film.Just because there is hardly an intelligent sentence in the script, and luckily there are only a few sentences in the film, it does not make it a work of art.

129,amado31-1,Totally Tasteless Art House/A Visual Insult,1,22 October 2008,"With the onslaught of independent and art house films making the cut these days that indeed provoke positive thought, there seems to be plenty directors who use art house as a ploy for putting just anything into film. ""Brown Bunny"" ranks high on the list of films that disintegrates the spirit of decency in film making. The film lacked an interesting plot, which is a travesty in itself. Cinematography? Poor. Direction? None. Character development? Mastheads have more life. Reason for the movie? Well, I'd argue with anyone who says that it was not to feed into Vincent Gallo's narcissism.The endless scenes of the road trip -- much of it involving a closeup of Gallo and out of focus -- was a recipe for a disastrous movie for starters. The contrived dialog didn't help and the ""shocking scene"" was nothing more than an upturned middle finger from Gallo as he smiled a thin smile at all who sat through his lumbering piece of work. At best, ""Brown Bunny"" was a home movie that has received far more press than it should have and Gallo knew it would get said press because of his little shocker.A movie -- Hollywood, independent, or art house -- should have rising action, a climax, and a denouement to at least achieve some type of artistic or visual credibility. ""Brown Bunny"" threw all of that out the window and instead threw up minutes of ""what?"" and a controversial surprise that left Gallo with some money in his bank account and everyone else shocked, to be verbose. Clearly not every script should become a movie. And no one should use this movie as a disclaimer for something worthy of watching beyond the opening credits.",The Brown Bunny

Too much nonsense leading up to the last half hour of the film did have me at certain points looking at the off switch on my remote control but by the end of it I cant help but feel that i'm glad i stuck by it. I'm writing this now and wondering whether I have just wasted 90 minutes of my life or whether i'm better for it. Hats off to Chloe Sevigny, it's a hard decision to give a non pornographic film an oral sex scene and carry it off so gracefully. The oral scene apart I can honestly say that I have seen her in more productive and trying roles, which i'm sure many of you will agree with. I do recommend this film if only to see for yourself what the hype is about, the tragic thing about this movie though will be said that if you cut the 3 most famous minutes(and by my account the most anticipated minutes) then it could have easily been given a 12 certificate.

131,richardblues444,riveting and indulgent- film mirrors its characters,8,11 February 2006,"I'm in the small, but perhaps vocal, minority of viewers who found The Brown Bunny to be a stunning, hyper-realistic, profoundly cinematic, and most importantly, original, piece of work. Fellatio happens. That Chloe Sevigny was brave enough to not rely on smoke, mirrors, and camera tricks is an absolute testament to her commitment to serious, well commitment. It's the most climactic sequence in a series of quietly riveting, haunting, vaguely aimless occurrences and encounters. If you're willing to surrender to the mood of the film however, each has meaning and substance though the feeling of emptiness is probably the most palpable quality of the film. On the surface it seems to meander, but I think, very much on the contrary, its direction is focused and precise, which is a significant accomplishment for a film concerning lost souls and their barely perceptible, faint shadows. What is so remarkable to me about the film is that it manages to convey the vacancy of its characters by taking on a shape that is itself seemingly vacant. And for me the risk pays off entirely  this is a film in which the mood is truly another presence, a character inhabiting the bleak but ultimately cathartic sensibility of the overall piece. I guess the film is arguably also self indulgent and perhaps demands more patience of the viewer than it should. But again, this is a film about self-indulgent, intensely selfish and damaged people. The film is like its occupants. And vice versa. They mirror each other.Obviously it's a style technique that has been used ever since filmmakers starting truly integrating aesthetics in a purposeful way, but transforming the ennui and day to day mundanity of an emotionally injured, lovelorn person into a searing portrayal of a disfigured, but somehow in tact, human being, is nothing to jeer at. Of course you have to share the opinion that Vincent Gallo's character is riveting and that his behavior is as powerful as it is strange. For me, his particular idiosyncrasies have always possessed a depth beyond merely quirky  they seem very organic and real in spite of the obvious arrogance. Like the filmmaker documented Overnight  he is unreservedly and unequivocally himself. And to me that demonstrates a great purity  to the degree that the flaws the film is frequently accused of having are not only forgivable, but intentional. Not to mention virtually impossible to pull off. The Brown Bunny is like a surgical view of this particular life and the appendages and organs of which it consists. There is a certain routineness and detachment to such dissection, but the irony is that the ""sub-surface"" of our psyches is actually ultimately not that different from the impressions we convey of ourselves.

133,tnemceff,Super movie. Not for everyone.,10,19 January 2007,"I watched ""The Brown Bunny"" six weeks ago and I was surprised that I really liked it. I love movies with a slow and deliberate and meaningful pace and got that from this one. I loved the natural quality of the scenes combined with the very structured mis-en-scene that framed them. The style felt very European to me. In the end I found the story emotionally powerful and well delivered. I felt that the movie was a sincere portrait of someone haunted by their loneliness and guilt because of something terrible that happened to the person they loved. Then tonight I was watching the 1975 Michelangelo Antonioni film ""The Passenger"" and was totally loving it. And I was thinking that the movie's style reminded me in some ways of ""The Brown Bunny"". Then all of a sudden I saw the name Daisy show up and it struck me that the newer movie had made homage to the older! And then I thought about how both movie's protagonists were running from themselves and their reality and how flashbacks of dead characters showed up in the movie. And I thought about how in the Gallo movie that many of the shots were taken from the perspective of the passenger side seat of the van. I think Antonioni's film is more political than Gallo's and I like that about the older film, but the deeply painful edge behind the newer film makes it a great complement to the other.

But that illusion soon fades. The first forty five minutes of the movie has about seven dialogues in total, ordinary background track in between and three unemotional and not even sexy kisses by the director Vincent Gallo who not surprisingly also plays the lead in the movie. The movie is painful to watch and makes you wonder about life in a way, you don't know how you decided to see it in the first place. Who exactly paid for it and why. Was it the tyre company, American tourism, the car glass company or the roads? And if so, why? And what the heck is the obsession in shooting from behind a dirty car window glass? And not to mention you also see roads at night under headlight. Not to mention, you see Vincent Gallo sitting in five different places trying to convey some deep meaning which was beyond my comprehension. Oh did I mention, you also see Vincent Gallo taking bath and watch his blurry nipples from close quarters. One more thing which you cannot miss, Vincent Gallo's hair. Half the time, they obstruct the view of the camera. After about fifty minutes, you start missing what a human voice sounds like. Overall, it looks like an hour and half bad advertisement of Vincent Gallo. Ya I get it, the guy is lonely. But seriously there are a million other ways that were far more tolerable. The movie does not make you empathize, it makes you sad. About yourself. There is no good editing, no screenplay, no story, dialogues music or even actors. Do not waste your time. Did I mention there is Vincent Gallo in the movie? Here's my suggestion, skip the first hour and watch just the remaining 25 minutes of the movie.",The Brown Bunny
137,AlkalineBoy,A film that attempts emotional realism and fails,1,29 August 2004,"In The Brown Bunny, V. Gallo is attempting to emulate the emotionally raw films of the 60s and 70s - a simple story with a complex protagonist whose journey of self-discovery drives the drama of the film. It's shot like a home movie with an extremely static camera, affording a stark and up-close glimpse of Bud Clay and his tortured / lonely life. All in all, the film has noble and mature intentions. So why does it fail so miserably?Two words - VINCENT GALLO. The Brown Bunny is entirely his film(""written, edited, produced and directed by Vincent Gallo"" is the only opening credit - he left out ""starring""), and he isn't talented enough in any of these capacities to create stirring emotion. The dialogue is awful, the pacing tedious, the direction laughable, and the acting is disastrous. The emotions are there on the screen, but they are presented in a ineffectual and amateurish way. At its best, The Brown Bunny comes across like a ""artsy"" film student's senior thesis. At its worse, the film exists merely as self-gratification for the extraordinarily egotistical Gallo. The most disturbing part of the film isn't the graphic oral sex scene, it's the fact that Gallo has created a 90 minute masturbation piece and he expects the viewer to sit there and share it with him.The emotion doesn't come off as realistic because Gallo is such a bad actor.He emotes like Ben Affleck in a manufactured and cheap Hollywood melodrama.The only good actor in the film (Chloe Sevigny) is given such poorly written lines and such stilted direction that even she comes off like a amateur. Without strong performances and masterful direction, the film's emotional core falls apart and the audience is left wondering, ""Why am I bothering to watch this film?""",The Brown Bunny
138,bridget_irish,Brown Bunny's burrowed a hollow in my heart...,10,15 February 2005,"Given all the hype, I didn't think I'd like Gallo's new film, but when it played for a week here, at the downtown Capitol Theater, I saw it almost every night it was screened...the first viewing, I came in late by a few minutes - the opening sequence - the motorcycle race with riders dipping in and out of the frame, sound fading in and out much like the sound of a ball game playing on the radio on a lazy sunny Sunday afternoon - lured me in and I was hooked, the film burrowing deeper into my heart as with each scene shot through the windshield, a different landscape, a different environment rolled before the cameraI appreciated Gallo's seduction of/interaction with each female character (except for Daisy) as analogous to the filmmaker's relationship with the audience",The Brown Bunny
139,Diabolik6,"Intelligent Filmmaking, Not for the Masses.",10,2 April 2004,"There was a time, not too long ago, in the late 1960's and early 1970's when studio films were not making the revenue they were prone to.  What they found that the baby boomers were being attracted to films that were made on a personal level for the director, writer, cast and crew and to the culture. These were films that were never intended for mainstream consumption. Thus, is the case with Vincent Gallo's films. When one watches a film, the viewer is comfortable with the idea that there will be a series of events that will give the viewer a safe rush of emotions.  These series are intended to be played out on the screen in the form of physical actions.  In the case of ""Brown Bunny"", all conflict and resolve occur in the form of Vincent Gallo character and presence.  There are no good guys or bad guys, just humans, flawed and weak.  In our culture, we are too afraid of showing real weakness in our protagonist.  It might point out the weakness in ourselves.  The ideal of the all knowing, all fixing hero is one that comforts the viewer. A great sadness and sense of loss is what Mr. Gallo is trying to convey with a simple narrative.  The outline of the road is one that has been used several times before to build upon the personal feelings of the director. Sam Peckinpah's ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"", Dennis Hopper's ""Easy Rider"" and Monte Hellman's ""Two-Lane Blacktop"".  It is a perfect canvas to show the protagonist's contrast to the society that chooses not to except him.  Mr. Gallo makes good use of this by showing one road looking like another and another and another. Brown Bunny's overall appeal is that it confronting the alienation of each other in society.  We grow further and further apart, apart from our families, co-workers, neighbors, and loved ones so that all we have left is a painful memory of what once was and can never return.  Life can be a solitude prison.   Mr. Gallo shows us such a prison for which there is no appeal. Alas, the cinema houses are flooded with people who are looking for their next fix of eye-candy.  It seems that when a personal little film that might not appeal to the soccer moms of America, people will not embrace it for bringing up concepts and ideas that do not make the movie going experience all the more zombie-making, but instead squash it far before even watching it.",The Brown Bunny
140,PatrickRPark,A Spiritual Journey...A Metamorphosis,10,3 September 2005,"First off, Vincent Gallo answers to no one. This fact upsets many, especially his critics. Secondly, it is apparent that ""The Brown Bunny"" is infamous, but for all the wrong reasons. Lastly, I don't expect many people to enjoy this movie, because it's not entertaining. I didn't ""enjoy"" this film in the conventional sense, because it's a film of emotional and nihilistic rhetoric. I'm not going to castigate a certain audience for this film. You know who you are. I can relate to this film, which is more than 90% of the films I have seen. With that said, I love this film. I love this film like I would love another human being. This film holds spiritual worth in my eyes, for it conveys the forsaken emotional capacity of loneliness and cynicism. I'm no ""pseudo-intellectual"", and I am not a pretentious scumbag. I feel Vincent Gallo was not acting, which is what makes this film an outstanding and iconoclastic oeuvre. Anyone who has had their heart broken can at least empathize with his character, no matter how narcissistic you find him. Although I'm sure I have more background knowledge of Vincent Gallo then the average viewer of this film, I feel that Vincent put complete ""blood, sweat, and tears"" into this, and it definitely shows. Only a selfless man can do this. The world obviously does not understand this film, which is fine, and the world obviously does not understand Vincent Gallo. In fact, nobody understands Vincent Gallo, including himself. I feel this film was a spiritual journey for Gallo, and in his eyes, this film is only for him. You must understand that he did not make this for anyone else except for himself, and you and me, as the viewer, were only invited along for the ride. This film will haunt those with the emotional capacity to interpret it accordingly. This film will anger. This film will confuse. Obviously, this film is not for everybody, and rightfully so. Amazing effort.",The Brown Bunny

I 'Flixed this DVD. After only 15 minutes (I should have known what was going to happen by the overly long opening track cycle race), I played this on 32X to just get by all the road trip stuff. But when I slowed down and there were other actors, it needed the 32X again; again no drama, no action, nothing but Vince. Not even worth the BJ.

142,burnthebeautiful,"Nice to look at, but no real storyline",7,1 January 2005,"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this film. Having become a fan of Chloe Sevigny after seeing Kids and Gummo, I first heard about this movie sometime in 2003, but it took me over a year of waiting before I finally find a copy of the film on DVD. Some reviews said it was fantastic, others said it was the worst thing they'd ever heard.The movie is relaxing and nice to look at, however these are the qualities of a good photograph, not the qualities of a good film. The movie consists almost entirely of Vincent Gallo driving his van from an unnamed town to California. There are some nice landscape shots, but there is no storyline, other than Gallo saying to a store clerk in the beginning of the film that he's about to drive to California.At the very end of the movie there's a half decent plot twist involving Chloe Sevignys character, who's only in the movie for 5 minutes anyway so you don't really care.At the end of the day if you want something nice to look at for an hour and a half, see Brown Bunny. But if you want a movie with a storyline, or interesting characters (well, characters at all), go elsewhere.And by the way, the blow job scene only lasts for about a minute, and you hardly 'see' anything anyway. And that's the unrated version... Trust me, downloading the movie just for that scene isn't worth it.",The Brown Bunny
143,motherfckzombies,Totally overrated and underrated for the wrong reasons....,7,16 February 2006,"everyone made a big deal because of the blow job at the end, where in fact what follows that scene is what really got me to be shocked. yes its a slow movie but yet so is elephant and that was great too. sometimes you have to really look at films and find other ways to appreciate em. i thought it was beautifully shot and acted as well. Gallo has never really ever disappointed me. the editing did indeed do something for the film because it really was too long, but what came out was a film that i ended up liking over Buffalo 66. i think people should look at this movie from a different perspective and stop hyping up the oral sex scene cause it's really not that big a deal.",The Brown Bunny
144,Jacknife92,"A potentially powerful and meaningful work, spoiled by its own arrogance.",4,5 May 2015,"Yeah, I get it. The idea of a lonely, troubled man residing in and briefly comforting equally tormented, needy women. Using them fleetingly, as they use him for their own comfort - like they might a (brown) bunny with its short lifespan. I get it.Credit too to Gallo for playing an exposing role, showing fragility, awkwardness and a grieving longing. Although restrained, he plays it well. But the man himself is such an unpleasant person. He criticises his peers by calling them pigs all the time, going on to make psychological presumptions about them. He even wished cancer upon Roger Ebert for giving him a bad review for this very film. He craves being avant-garde, he loves being hated and controversial - an edgy and potentially challenging figure. Aggravating the status-quo if you will. All this is evident in the film with the long takes, the fumbling dialogue, the unusual, unconventional angles, the extended soundtrack pieces. The substance behind this film is great, I think it's a very good, existential contemplation - but it's all lost and corrupted by the Director's arrogance. His petty nature to need to go against the grain.The Master (Anderson, P.T. 2012), is more or less everything this film tried to be. It just does it better. Much better. It's a slow, lengthy and pondering narrative; very ambiguous and interpretive. Following a troubled man, torn from a lost love, wandering aimlessly and abusively to seek answers and unwittingly confront his own demons. Hell, it even features the character riding off into a desert on a motorcycle. Now that film is twice as long as this one, and whilst many films of its length and pace will have over-indulgence attributed to them, its execution is nonetheless masterful, its dialogue intelligent and thought provoking, the performances intense & revealing and generally its vision is uncompromising and considered. So ultimately, in light of that, The Brown Bunny might have been great had the man behind it not been so difficult. Had be been able to discipline himself more, and not inject his abrasive personality into the piece so much. Because now he's just left with being stained as the creator of one of the most reviled and embarrassing pieces of cinema in recent memory (although I'm sure he probably loves that), instead of the architect behind an empathetic work of art.",The Brown Bunny

With Brown Bunny we finally see a film that can express art without limits of traditional cinema, with natural light effects not sweeten by studio techniques, but with sweet music that transports you in this road movie that remind me the great ""Two-lane Blacktop"". The deepness of his acting held by his strong and manly face reminds that nowadays we are not obligated to see androgynous retiring actors. The suffering of the character is shown by his erotic hallucinations that are disturbing and show something that smells like reality, something that is not seen in most of the movies.

You get the truth you get the reasons those things *feel* important to us. Not just the empty shells exposing sex or dramatic negative circumstances..its real and gives the viewer everything they need to feel from the inside out, but also to understand true things that lie underneath all of our lives.

148,egresh,Road to loneliness,8,2 January 2007,"Many of you say that a good film has to have frequent dialogs: then you're saying that early films with no dialogs like Andalusian dog or The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari are bad films (I'm not comparing them to Brown Bunny, just commenting on lack-of-dialogs issue).The only film I could compare it to is Two Lane Black top. It has the same atmosphere of loneliness, grieve and endless road to nowhere from nowhere. Even the theme of race-drivers on the road is very similar. Brown Bunny is a poetic meditation on human suffering in the world where you can't find a friend. Right when Bud's relationship with a woman he runs away. It stems from Bud's belief that he will never be able to live with a woman again.Many people say Brown Bunny is pornographic based on the fellatio scene. The meaning of pornography(from a dictionary) which is the representation of the human body or sexual activity with the goal of sexual arousal. It's not there to give you a hardon and if you want to see a sex scene it's always easier to watch porn. However the blow-job brings back Bud's memory of Daisy lying unconscious on bed, raped by two men. The scene is necessary for it reveals the whole reason of Bud's sorrow. It's questionable why it had to be so naturalistic, whole scene could be filmed with less details.The filming technique gave me a feeling that Bud was filming himself alone on the road and what we are watching is his video diary. To the end, close-ups get closer and the atmosphere more intimate which builds up the atmosphere. Camera is very raw and grainy and it reflect's Bud's character",The Brown Bunny

The text is boring, I'm still trying to figure out the Cheryl Tiegs scene, and watching Vincent Gallo suffering from constant exhaustion and trying to find some warped symbolism every time he wipes his eyes is a total waste of time. If your into Vincet Gallo sucking face and receiving oral sex, this movie is right up your alley. Otherwise, this is a hackneyed example of something that tried to make viewers think, but led them to slumber, dreaming of renting another movie. This might be one of the worst movies made in any century.",The Brown Bunny

The flow that seems to irritate many becomes hypnotic. No dialog and road shots for 30 minutes. The shot in the salt flats where Gallo rides his bike into the mirage of the horizon is one of my favorite shots of all time. Right up there with some of Mann's best intro-shots, and I bet it didn't take Gallo 3 days to block it. It is just great.BTW, flew up front w/ Gallo from LAX to EWR a couple months ago, I bump into the midget again at baggage and we make eye contact - he's looks like he thinking, ""$hit, here comes some banal BS"".

151,tjockin,Unbelievably bad,1,30 September 2006,"Within the first 30 seconds of this film, it's clear that something is not right. A hand-held camera follows motorcycle racers around a track. And keeps following them. Nothing happens. Is this somebody's home video? Clumsy edits and odd gaps of silence are thrown in. Another 30 seconds pass. More of the same. Then: a second long, pointless, badly filmed and edited scene of a racer loading his bike into a van. What IS this? Welcome to The Brown Bunny. Within the first few minutes it's clear that this is something like a failed student movie by a guy who really should have stuck with shop class. Initial confusion gives way to astonishment, and then some amusement at the high kitsch value of this almost unbelievably bad film. But those laughs don't justify sitting through the length of the film, and I dare anybody to watch this movie without fast-forwarding.Much of this film takes follows a 40ish loser ""Bud"" (Vincent Gallo) as he drives across the country to LA. Road scenes often consist of very long intervals shot through a dirty windshield at the road, sometimes long enough for some song the director liked to play all the way through. There are probably a dozen of these absurd, painfully lengthy sequences.The oral sex scene near the end of this film, also awkwardly filmed, is really the final act of comical self-indulgence on the part of Vincent Gallo, who is the writer, director, producer, one of the cameramen, director of photography, editor, and male lead (like I said, student movie).

I detest big Hollywood movies, car chases, and all that other garbage, and I go out of my way to find interesting indie movies. This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Gallo's attempt at a portrayal of a ""lost soul"" is ridiculous, and Chloe Sevigny may never get another serious movie role after her portrayal.

There was also a lot of flare throughout, but again, was he intending this to make it look like a 70's Dennis Hopper effort? The fact that Vincent did almost everything himself was a bold attempt good but I think it was at the expense of the overall quality of the film. However, I love the way his inner word was shown with such little dialogue.I also like the spare locations and his odd relationships with women too and found it very true to life in that I know real life characters similar to this.It was nice to see Cheryl Tiegs in there too. And in THAT scene I think Chloe could have done the deed more expertly and the filming again was a bit amateurish. But excuse me for asking but what oh what did he spend the $10M budget on??

155,brian-maniotis,About the dissent,5,16 December 2005,"This movie seems to develop a lot of scrutiny for what it has, or doesn't have. The major issue with the film is that it is supposed to be very minimalist in it's portrayal of the character, his environments, who he meets and basically the plot outline.Before watching Brown Bunny most people have to consider many things; when directors are making films they tend to think visually. Directors tend to do this especially when they are responsible for writing or producing their films. Even if you could ask Gallo what his intentions were before taking precedence over the film, he may not be able to even answer his own questions; which is a lot like some other directors you might have heard from, especially if you've attended some Q&A sessions with any renowned directorial icons.In the movie, there is a lot of things that escape definition, and rightly so, because it's specifically made to have a cloudy narrative structure to it, you're supposed to be led almost seemingly aimlessly with the main character, and why bud is doing what he does. I think that many people expected this film to be full of raw emotion, and melodramatic excess...no I think we were all surprised.However, I'm pretty sure that Gallo got what he wanted out of his viewers by developing your uncertainties on what's supposed to, or going to happen. You see, Brown Bunny (I believe at least,) is supposed to generate high psychological conflict with the audience, and it is realistic in a sense that life isn't always dramatic, and is really only subjectively led into conflict. People should make more judgments on his character ""Bud,"" especially considering he's somewhat of a transient that is directly connected to humble, everyday surroundings wherever he goes.I think people should make the connection that this is a film built to capture the silently aggravating, yet lurid serenity of it's settings, and how this person sort of aimlessly searches for what he thinks is the only purpose to his stale, unflinching life. This movie represents that there are separate non-consensual forms of human consciousness when people select their destinations, and when they are actually embarking on them, or are engaged in the efforts to do so. This movie builds upon the mysteries in doing just that, and how the character is only left to his unscrupulous actions in lieu of all of this. It just so happens that it is sex, and motorcycle racing thus far, which are just pertinent to his need for ""escape."" Even so, we as viewers cannot wholly say whether or not he feels these are the answers for himself.Brown Bunny isn't a Bad movie if you think about it, I wouldn't go around saying it's life-changing, but it is worth considerable merit, and I think people should take the consideration to realize that sometimes that movies invoke criticism in us on almost an unconscious emotional level. It's obvious that there's shock value that can be easily pointed at...but this isn't all shock value, it's something I'm sure people don't realize is the true purpose of the movie...to sort of bend and twist your perceptions of it. This is like what happens in most good movies, and Brown Bunny isn't any different...and yet, that's still a good thing in the end.",The Brown Bunny
156,ths907,contains spoilers: a couple questions about brown bunny,7,24 August 2005,"I presume all reading this have seen the movie, which seemed to me to be very ""end-loaded,"" meaning that what happens in the last few minutes completely transforms your perception and understanding of everything that has gone before. I want to ask others if they understood the same thing as me. The oral sex scene takes place entirely in the main character's imagination, right? This is the main character's catharsis in which he confronts his grief over the death of the woman he loved. But was his relationship with the girl entirely imaginary? In the early scene he visits the dead girl's parents, but they have no memory of him, and he speaks fondly of playing together with the girl as children. There is the mysterious element of the brown bunny, which seems to have lived forever. In the flashback fragments after the oral sex scene, while the girlfriend is explaining that she is dead, it seems at first as though the point of contention in the couple is over the fact that she smoked crack when she was pregnant, and so lost the baby. A couple of lines later, however, we discover that the girl herself is dead. During the flashback sequences that accompany and illustrate this discovery, we see the party scene where the rape takes place. We see the main character sort of cluelessly stick his head in the bedroom door to discover that the girl he loves is being raped. At the end of the movie, I am asking myself whether the main character is suffering grief for the death of a woman with whom he actually had a relationship, or whether perhaps he never actually had an adult relationship with this woman, but was living in a fantasy developed out of his boyhood love for the girl next door? Another question: the first brief bit of soundtrack music in the movie (not the motorcycle race sound) comes, I could swear, from a Pasolini movie, but I cannot remember which one. Can anyone else?",The Brown Bunny
157,Tedward311,Why The Brown Bunny is one of the best films I've ever seen,9,20 September 2004,"If you asked me to rate The Brown Bunny on a scale from 1 to 10 just after I saw it, I'd probably have given it a 7. An hour later - an 8. Two nights later and I'd unequivocally give it a 10. I've been thinking of the film a lot over these two days, and I have finally discovered why it has stayed in my head like it has. As it dawned on me and I realized I want others to know what makes this movie so special, whether you have already seen it or have yet to see it.I really didn't enjoy the first hour and fifteen minutes of the film as I was watching it. Basically, Bud Clay (Gallo) just mopes around, driving in his car cross-country, meeting a few other non-descript people but choosing to remain completely isolated. I'm sure a lot of other viewers shared these sentiments. However, I'm equally as sure for many the final fifteen minutes or so in which Gallo was in the hotel room with Daisy were incredibly memorable in contrast.So why then has The Brown Bunny resonated with me as it has? Was it because I sympathized or emphasized with Bud's depression? This explanation is too simple (and a relatively common effect for good films) and does not fit because I don't feel the loss of a loved one as he did. In other words, Bud's pain was certainly his own and Gallo delivered an incredibly unique and passionate performance. The answer lies in the fact that the first 1:15 gave no explanation to Clay's obvious sorrow. With no reason for emotional attachment, the viewer is relatively unconcerned. Imagine watching the news and seeing some civilian you never knew in Iraq was tragically killed in a suicide blast. You may feel bad for the person but only on a surface level.If a film depicted the last hour of this person's pain-filled existence, would you hail it as a great piece of cinema as is? I wouldn't think so. What I'm getting at is that you cannot truly feel emotional pain or tragedy unless you learn about a person, not just what happens to a person. In the first 1:15 of the film, we learned what happened to Bud, and Gallo provided us no real reason to feel for him. We just saw him go through the motions and wondered why. Then, when the reasons for his pain were abruptly made obvious after the scene with Daisy, we instantly developed care and concern for him and finally felt his pain whereas we were simply confused and perhaps even disinterested just moments before. Thus the first 1:15 finally made sense in the greater context of the film as it actually provided background to Bud's anguish, not revealed until the end when we finally learned about him. It was an incredible feeling as a viewer, only magnified for me since seeing it unfold on screen two nights ago.I really wonder about all the users, and especially the professional film critics, that have given this movie such vitriolic criticism. Were they so bored with the lead in that they missed the final pay-off? Have they downplayed the final scene as too contrived or unrealistic? Perhaps some didn't favor Gallo's weak and diminutive character. Yet the comments I have read indicate those who dislike this movie didn't give it a chance, or rather were tainted by their feelings of the first 1:15 without letting the significance of this sink in with the information provided in the last 15 minutes. In my mind, Gallo was at the brink of giving us too many ""boring"" scenes (or rather ""why should I care about this guy"" scenes) before giving us the final scene, which makes the ultimate effect all the more dramatic. The oral sex scene fairly disgusted me as it was happening but the flashbacks that followed have made me realize this was a necessary and (cinematically) daring addition to the story. Though certainly a point of concern as you are viewing the film for the first time, the pacing in this (US) version of the Brown Bunny ultimately is revealed to be perfect for creating the dramatic emotional effect that comes through enduring the story lead-in. Unless you are to reject the film's conclusion as not producing this effect, which I cannot see how after watching and paying close attention to it, I see no reasonable way to vehemently criticize this work of art.I cannot remember the last time a movie has given me such a delayed and ultimately gratifying emotional response, and I hope more people will be willing to give this controversial movie a legitimate chance.",The Brown Bunny

There were so many unfulfilled possibilities for drama that it was hard to watch. The disjointed encounters make it seem as though any man can be with any woman, and that just isn't so. The few songs included were all of the cry me a river type that only seems needed when you have broken up with someone.The bike scenes audio were horribly recorded and garbled at best.So, to sum up, unless you are a Vincent Gallo fan, who is used to this type of self-indulgence,do not buy this movie.",The Brown Bunny

Suddenly you are going through Vincent Gallo and his pain.You are not getting a key to a mystery but a pathway to a deadlock.We are looking to the face of someone so disturbed and damaged.I'm not happy with the story but the rest was awesome. A true indie cinema.",The Brown Bunny
160,mouritsvanballegooijen,Worst movie ever,1,24 September 2007,"As a film fan I've tried to watch it on three different occasions... I stopped watching it before the notorious bj scene. I've tried this movie stoned, drunk and sober and it is just horrible. I kept thinking to myself: ""why am I watching some narcissistic guy pretending to be an actor?"" I read on wikipedia that this movie cost $10.000.000. Someone got screwed big time. I'm a designer with film making experience and I can make a better quality film with my DV cam and my laptop. I actually suspect Vincent Gallo of having used just that and putting the rest of the $9.990.000 in his pocket. Besides that the plot is just one big ego trip of Mr. Gallo Acting: kindergarten play level. Framing: awful Technical difficulty level of this movie: high school with dumb students. And the worst part: It's so pretentious it isn't funny anymore, while the level of associations and intelligence would bring tears to any serious film student or any sapient being.",The Brown Bunny
161,sketchydogg,Independent film making at it's best.,10,6 December 2006,"I'm not a fan of long winded comments depicting things that happen in the film and why, so I'll keep this short.This film is one of the best independent films I have seen. The pace is perfect, the angles of the shots spot on and the imagery perfectly depicts the character's feeling of loneliness.Only Vincent Gallo could portray such emotions (that some directors and actors have a hard time showing) through complete silence and pull it off with perfect ease. I was already a huge fan of Buffalo 66 before seeing this film, to be honest I was prepared for something on a lower level to his first independent movie but I was very pleasantly surprised.This isn't a film for everyone, so unless you have an open mind I suggest you go watch the latest Bond movie instead.",The Brown Bunny
162,sergiy-gagarin,I can relate,10,26 October 2012,"Finally I watched the movie I've became acquainted with by its soundtrack a while ago. Vincent Gallo's movie and he is also the director of the photography. Slow paced, beautiful pathetic (yes I mean what I wrote) shots, undemanding cut (so you can smoke and watch you thoughts below the screen without fear of loosing anything important), soundtrack comes in an unobtrusive almost mellow way, that explicitly truthful blow-job scene at the end and overtly complex traumatic neurotic-schizoid relationship I can relate.If I ever met Gallo in person I frankly don't know if I find anything to tell him. And yes I like the movie very much.",The Brown Bunny
163,muz1982,Brilliant and Haunting,10,19 November 2006,"I was apprehensive in the beginning when i was asked to see this film, that the lead character was a race driver tuned me out a little on its own, as its a topic i have no interest in whatsoever. It's not an easy film to get into by any stretch of the imagination. Long stretches of just Bud and the road will test you patience, and a lack of dialogue in the rest of the film does little to soften the problem. But, stick with it, the rewards will pay off manyfold in the end. It is a disturbingly real film with characters you can believe in and care about. In fact my biggest complaint with modern films is the flimsy characters.A note for the people warned away by a rather ignorant view on the filatio scene: While it is very graphic it is in no means gratuitous, its integral to the storyline and the revealing of Buds character, and without it the film and Bud himself would be a lot less real. Nothing chokes you in the way a film does when you feel for its characters.",The Brown Bunny

165,btb-ii,Definitely an acquired taste,3,5 December 2006,"If you can endure a 90 minute portrait of brooding self loathing with virtually no dialog and uninspired cinematography, this film is for you. The notorious scene with Daisy is incongruous. Perhaps, I am dense, but in my view, the emperor has no clothes. To be successful, this film should have elicited a strong interest in the lead character. But in the end, you have learned little about someone who is shallow and unappealing. This film portrays the journey of a motorcyclist tormented by demons vaguely hinted at in mysterious stops he makes in route. You see that he is attracted and repulsed by women. (Cheryl Tiegs, for those of you old enough to remember her from the 1970s is perfect in what amounts to a cameo.) But his encounters with women are so fleeting and glancing that you learn little until the end of the journey. Then, what you learn is too trite to support your having endured the trip with him. I believe Vincent Gallo had a serious idea, but the idea is unrealized.",The Brown Bunny
166,citizen21,a masterpiece,10,5 October 2008,"While perhaps not for everyone, Vince Gallo's The Brown Bunny is far from the indulgent, sleep inducing mess that many seem to think. The strange knee jerk reactions people seem to have are, in a way, a compliment to Gallo. He has not made an easy film, the kind that goes down smoothly and is ultimately forgettable. He has also not made a safe film that refuses to take a stand or express a view, that panders to the notion that films are merely driven by the idea of mass market entertainment. So what do you mean by entertainment? Do you mean something that makes you think? Do you mean something that passes the time? Do you mean something that distracts? The Brown Bunny is not a commercial film in the sense that it actively courts a wide audience. If you are seeking quirky comedies or action films, and that is the limit of what you like, then yeah, don't rent this film. That's cool. But if you are seeking a film that walks the line between the real and the imaginary, the internal and the external, that functions as much as a hauntingly beautiful cinematic poem as an oddly simple story of one man's response to his own alienation, loss, guilt and grief, then give it a chance. The Brown Bunny is that rare film that is a genuine work of art.",The Brown Bunny
167,penwise,Incredibly Awful,1,25 April 2008,"Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Completely misguided and self-indulgent, it has none of the redeeming qualities of other very bad movies: it's neither campy or unintentionally hilarious. This film is the very definition of tedious, pretentious crap. I rented it solely for my own prurient curiosity about the infamous Chloë Sevigny blow job scene, so maybe I got what I deserved. The seemingly endless, blurry shots of the side of Vincent Gallo's head as he drives his van across country were excruciating. And ""Bud's"" damaged, yet sensitive, attitude toward women was like a 13 year-old boy's wet dream. The formulaic device of giving all the female characters flower names was especially contrived and annoying. It seems as if the entire purpose of this movie was to show that Gallo knows how to ride a motorcycle and has a larger than average cock. I thought ""Buffalo '66"" was a sweet and engaging comedy, so ""Brown Bunny"" was a real disappointment. See this movie only if you want to subject yourself to the absolute worst in contemporary, art film-making.",The Brown Bunny
168,xande88,The man loves a mirror...,1,21 September 2007,"I see a lot of movies, and I've seen a lot o really bad ones. The worst of them is Oscar material if compared to this film. Never has a filmmaker been so self-indulgent, cool wanna-be, disgustingly megalomaniac, and completely oblivious to an audience -- an audience left to watch a total absence of creativity -- as in this ridiculous attempt at artistic depth and deeper meanings, supposedly hidden behind empty images and badly written lines. Terrible, unforgivable waste of precious celluloid.Watching a road through a dirty windshield for hours might seem a clever metaphorical statement if you're on crack, or are as delusional as the director, who probably thinks of himself as the greatest film-making entity that ever lived.Me? Well, those were 90 minutes of my life that I'll never have back and do something useful with -- although I wish I could.But the truth is that it doesn't matter if a thousand people told you how despicable this movie is -- this is a movie that MUST be seen, otherwise you won't believe someone actually had the bad taste and lack of everything else (including talent and judgment) to make it.",The Brown Bunny

Well, it might have been controversial alright, with the sex scenes at the end, but c'mon! There's almost no dialogue, and it resumes to a geezer driving around in a van with a two stroker bike in the back... The start of the film is way too long for what it is - the start of the film! I forgot what film i was watching till the race finished. The concept is not bad, i believe if this film was done by some other director, we could have had something fuller, a more complete sense of what really is going on in the character's head. And around it... But the way it was done, it's too two dimensional. I enjoyed when he got that gorgeous two stroker out in the salted flat bed and went for a ride. Not exactly a lot... The acting is amateurish, the photography is cheap, the editing felt like it was unfinished... And that final sex scene, when he's getting his dick sucked, is hardcore in my eyes and turned an already really poorly made film into an outright crap film.If you ask me, i say don't bother with this title, it's not sexy or sensual, just plain boring and with an hardcore blow job scene at the end...",The Brown Bunny
170,paulgresch,It's not Buffalo 66,10,20 August 2004,"It's not Buffalo 66, and it's definitely not supposed to be. Those looking for a film like that will be disappointed. The movie is supposed to be a road movie. It's supposed to be about a man on the road by himself. Does that sound exciting to you? Probably not, but that doesn't change the fact that the film has many beautiful scenes shot on the road that are essential to the plot and to the development of the character and what he's going through. People need to drop their fascination with the fellatio scene, forget about it, and grow up. This movie is better than most people will give it credit for, but that's because most people won't give it a fair chance. It's not for those with short attention spans, and it's not for those who are looking for a romantic comedy. There are many humorous scenes in the film, and although they're more tongue-in-cheek than most of Gallo's movies, they're still great. I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival a year ago, and I wish it would be released again so I could go see it. I'm sure it would be even better the second time. There are a lot of subtleties that would be better received a second time, I'm sure.",The Brown Bunny
171,andreiabarbosa,the absolute Emotion picture,10,29 May 2003,"very mild spoilersIf you don't let yourself rock by the melancholic tone that Gallo sets from the beginning of the movie, it will be hard to enjoy it. There are very few narrative elements to hold on to - this is a film of pure mood, of absolute emotion, and that's what makes both its frailty and its genius.For those who let themselves be taken by Gallo's van across America, the journey is unforgettable. Nostalgia rises as the road unfolds before you, in a hypnotic monotony punctuated by weather changes and hopeless encounters with women that, as Gallo's character himself, are overwhelmed with longing. As Gallo arrives to his destination, some explanation is provided for the cause of his despair. Chloë Sevigny is fabulous at the climax scene of the film, where all the longing building up during the trans-american ride materializes into an unambiguous shape. Dialogues and interaction are courageously mundane: strong, silly, emotional, maladroit.This is the ultimate romantic film. A non-hollywoodized, near abstract love tale.",The Brown Bunny

The Brown Bunny is a prophetic existential dirge, a film that will forever embody the ravages of love and loss. A true realization of despair in the most vulnerable of forms; a recollection of beating visions, fever dreams and memories which bare stark juxtapositions through the barren purging landscape of roadside Americana.No one does Aesthetics better than Vincent Gallo. The most important American film since Monte Hellman's Cockfighter (1974) Vincent Gallo has made his masterpiece.",The Brown Bunny
173,joana310,Beautiful,10,18 July 2013,"This movie follows Bud Clay, a motorcycle racer, as he drives to California. Along the way, he encounters 3 different women, each embodying a loneliness similar to his own. However, Bud can only be satisfied by one, Daisy. This movie shows his journey, not only physically, but emotionally and mentally.This is one of the most emotionally crushing films I have ever seen. It's crushing in a different way. It leaves you numb. It's one of those films that inhabits your mind for days and never loses its grip. Typically, I'm a crier, I've cried during so many films that I've lost count. But I didn't cry during or after this film. Once it concluded, I was left in shock. The way Vincent Gallo, who is brilliant in this, ties everything together is unbelievable. You feel that you become a part of the story, but, really, it becomes a part of you. The film also stars Chloe Sevigny, who is just as brilliant. No matter what is said about the oral scene, I will forever defend its inclusion in the film. No, it's not gratuitous, and no, it isn't porn. The act REPRESENTS something, like many events/people/things/occurrences/traits represent something in cinema.I think this is a beautiful depiction of loneliness and very easy to relate to, as its hard to imagine someone ever not feeling lonely. Maybe some have felt it for longer periods of time than others, but it's not an alien emotion, even though ""alien"" is the exact way people feel when lonely. The way it's presented however, is avant-garde, so I get why people don't like it. Nonetheless, I think it's perfect. This is a film that will forever be ingrained into my subconscious. I won't ever be able to escape it and the impact it has had on me. 10/10!",The Brown Bunny

Finally we reach OUR climax with the couple meeting, as they *ahem* reach theirs. In about 8 minutes (maybe it's 5 or 10?) the film is over and the entire experience has been turned on its head-puts The 6th Sense to shame.

It takes you on a cross-country trip into the mind of a man who is dealing with the worst kind of emotional pain. Along the way it makes us wonder ""what is wrong with this guy - why is he behaving this way - what is his problem?"". In the end we see what his problem is and we feel his pain. The ending is SO worth the trip. This movie really touched me and made me feel - and it would not have had such an impact without ""that"" scene. I'm a woman who loves men and I saw the act as such a profoundly loving one that I am shocked at people, men especially, who diminish its significance. Kudos to all involved - it was brave of them to give us this masterpiece and risk misunderstanding and ridicule. I loved this movie - it will stay with me forever.",The Brown Bunny
177,jginkorea,Contrary to popular opinion,10,3 March 2004,"I think it is my turn to truly take the stand for a movie that I believe to be unbelievably interesting and emotional. I recently saw Gallo's ""The Brown Bunny"" in Shibuya, Tokyo and walked away amazed at the beauty of this film. I have read many awful reviews of this film and was prepared to be dissapointed, but quite to the contrary, i found this film a pleasure to watch and look forward to owning the DVD.What I really liked about the film is several fold:1. The directing strays from the conventional. We are exposed to off-centered close-ups of Gallo, a long (5 minute) view of a motorcycle race coming in and out of focus, a dirty windshield as we drive down a midwestern American road. We feel the pain of a road trip. Gallo's solitude and contemplation really come through the directing.2. The music is beautiful and fitting. Often, we hear the majority of a piece of music inserted in the film with lyrics that complement Gallo's thought.3. The acting by Gallo is predictable and enjoyable. The other characters in the film seem to be amateurs (aside from Ms. Sevigny). This adds to the film's luster and beauty.4. By the way, the end is pretty crazy and emotionally harsh. The pace of the movie dramatically changes in the last act. We come to understand the reasons for the meditative cross-country drive.5. I really liked the way that Gallo showed us America. We don't see the Hollywood flash or NY chic of the US, but the small towns, the rest stops, the cheap hotels and the back roads all brilliantly shot.Please don't follow popular opinion without having first watched this movie. I recommend you watch this movie by yourself and give it your undivided attention. This beats the shit out of 90% of the movies out there.",The Brown Bunny

When I saw the film on its premier in Cannes it was a real scandal. So if you are a snob, skip this movie. But if you are someone really interested in the art of film, you should see it. Although it has a very slow tempo the pictures, the whole atmosphere keeps you locked on to the screen. The Brown Bunny is more like meditation than a good Sunday night movie. V.Gallo is a real Cassavetes-follower. Not only because he made a real ""hand-made"" film by-passing Hollywood but also because he wants to reveal real emotions, to talk about people and reality. And if this doesn't fit into the conventional way of a - so called - storytelling than let it be so.",The Brown Bunny

Of course Gallo plaid o a lot of roles (film director, scenario, actor...) but why should that matter ? It's his film and he did it his way. A very efficient way. Thanks a lot.",The Brown Bunny
180,bunnybrown,The film is out - The REAL reviews are in.,10,6 September 2004,"Now that the movie has been made available for the public to see, the reviews that actually count are starting to come out. It is a shame that so many people are entering the theaters with a preconceived notion that the movie sucks. (pun IS intended). Well, after watching The Brown Bunny this evening, I found it to be a beautiful, imaginative, and purposeful film. Movie-goers need to grow up, and get with a new program - not every film is supposed to have witty dialogue every 30 seconds and kung-fu maniacs dancing around to the silly beats of techno-music. Get behind the wheel with a character for once, put yourself in their place. How would you feel? What would you do? Yes, it is sometimes good to watch a film that is simply a snap-shot of real-life possibilities. It is a shame that only 7 theaters in the U.S. are playing The Brown Bunny. This only shows that there exists a gang of namby-pamby distributors. I hope Gallo directs hundreds and hundreds more films, even if they collect dust in his closet. If you like Impressionist Art, read a history book and learn for yourself what the ""critics"" said about that new movement at the time. We have all benefited because people and the artists themselves, didn't listen to those cry-baby gate-keepers.",The Brown Bunny
181,c-s-j-598-520342,Terribly dull,4,23 June 2013,"A terribly boring film. Though it do has a story to tell, it barely covers any sort of a storyline... At times this makes it hard to sit through. Nevertheless, it is a movie that had to and was bound to be made, as the idea comes through well; and an emotional state which is kind of complex, is portrayed silently, without much interaction, and then, in the end, the reasons and history are revealed. If you look at only certain parts of the film it might seem as if it were but hours of driving, a little atmospheric in a way, but far from enough to give a reason to sit through the whole film... The whole film has an amateur feeling, meaning that there is nothing special in the screenplay, cinematography, or music -- the story itself has one or two lines that are pretty original, though, and around the end it becomes unusually explicit, which gives a slightly realistic vibe to it all in all.",The Brown Bunny
182,hennies,Don't believe the hype.,10,10 October 2004,"If ever there were a film that was misrepresented by the media and hype surrounding it then it's certainly ""The Brown Bunny"". Despite Roger Ebert's shockingly immature reading of this film as ""the worst in Cannes' history"" (and then inexplicably changed his mind after Gallo made minor edits) ""The Brown Bunny"" is deadly serious and not the least bit self-indulgent. There is a difference between egomania and introversion and this is most definitely the latter. A character study on loneliness, isolation, guilt, regret, pain, love... it is one of the most moving films I have ever seen.Obviously this is not for everyone, but for those who claim this is ""boring"" or ""tedious"" then I make the simple claim that this film merely operates at a much slower rate of events than what we're used to. The rate of change is slow allowing for a much greater attention to detail and allowing the viewer much more time to consider more than what would be immediately recognizable in a faster paced film.Bud Clay driving off into the distance on his motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats, his body slowly becoming one with his reflection on the ground, is one of the most beautiful moments of film of the year. The film is simply brilliant.",The Brown Bunny
183,kmcallis,Worst movie ever,1,27 August 2005,"This really was the worst movie I've ever seen. I consider myself a cinematic intellectual, and this poor excuse for an art film was ludicrous. It was 90 minutes of Vincent Gallo self-aggrandizement complete with a 10 minute scene of explicit oral sex that added nothing to the movie whatsoever. I would recommend that everyone sees it, however, just so they can marvel at the fact this was ever released my a studio. I think those that actually accept this as a valid ""art film"" are too wrapped up in long pauses, languid eyes, and landscape and forget a decent movie should have relevancy, real emotion, dialogue, and some semblance of reality. . . . .",The Brown Bunny
184,L_Diablo,Pretentious/Excruciating/Harmful if swallowed,1,23 August 2005,"I WAS the biggest Vincent Gallo fan of all time....Last night I sat through this whole ""movie"". I got to work this morning and I am writing my first ever IMDb review in hopes that I can save you the 90 minutes of your life that you WILL NEVER GET BACK if you subject yourself to The Brown Bunny! The BJ is definitely NOT WORTH holding out for. If you absolutely have to see it, just skip to the last scene and then watch ANYTHING ELSE on the shelf! Race fans will be equally disappointed. Please don't pay for this release in any way, shape, or form. I am ashamed to say that I have been waiting patiently to see the latest Gallo effort for over two years. I tried to keep my expectations low. I could never have been prepared for what turned out to be an offensive attempt at how an ostentatious swill slinger insults audiences everywhere with his tasteless drivel. I will give almost any film a chance - do yourself a favor, sharpen pencils or just tap your fingers on the table for a while. I guarantee it will be more satisfying than watching The Brown Bunny.Having been a huge fan of Buffalo '66 and his acting performances in The Funeral, Truth or Consequences, N.M., and Get Well Soon - I was anxious to see what Mr. Gallo could do if he could do whatever he wanted. Obviously, he doesn't want to do much. The ""action sequences"" consisted of crowds walking down the streets of Las Vegas. However, if you happen to want to watch him drive around without purpose or direction, take showers, snub hookers, change his clothes and mumble endlessly, then this is the one for you! All that I could really derive from this hour-and-a-half trainwreck is that Gallo has major issues with female relationships, and prefers women who have flowers for names. There is really nothing to review - and I wouldn't say that if it weren't true. Nothing happened - for 90 minutes. Nothing. If someone were to say that I am missing the point of the movie (what, he's depressed?) then I would have to reply, that the point should not have to be chiseled out of 4 conversations amidst 90 minutes of driving (and by the way Dr. Low Budget - feel free to clean the windshield next time you are going to make us all sit in your van. And you could always make your name show up more in the credits - what are you a Tarantino wannabe now?). We have all taken a road trip at one point or another - and no one wants to take someone else's road trip. Apparently, Gallo has less fun than anyone in cinema. Now Todd Solondz appears to be a merry movie maker. Darren Aronofsky is happy-go-lucky. Brown Bunny makes New Rose Hotel seem like an indie masterpiece. Comparitively speaking, Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes is a work of genius. Wretched.I WAS the biggest Vincent Gallo fan of all time....",The Brown Bunny
185,teemui,A melancholic and intimate work,10,21 December 2004,"What bothers me most about art-house films is that they often try too hard to affect us on an intellectual level rather than concentrate on the emotional content. This approach often leads to shallow, over-intellectual and unaffecting results. I think part of the reason why many are putting this film down is that it offers no great intellectual themes or problems for our hungry minds to chew on when it's what we've come to expect from cinematic art nowadays. So The Brown Bunny probably won't satisfy you in that respect, but it has more emotion than the last ten years of French cinema combined.There's something very intimate about this film. The camera is usually still and aimed a little off the action, which adds a voyeuristic feel to the whole experience. There's very little dialogue in the first hour or so, mostly we see a sad-eyed Bud (Gallo) driving in his van with long shots of the open road. There are a few encounters with women, but rather than ease the feeling of loneliness, each of them enhances it. The soundtrack is as melancholic as the imagery, the songs are expertly picked and their role becomes much more important than mere background music. It's a road movie in its purest form, a perfect medium to express the utter loneliness our main character is experiencing.Much has been said about the last part of the film, when Bud finally meets his long lost love, Daisy (played by the wonderful Sevigny). I will admit being skeptical myself after seeing too many movies that add explicit scenes just for shock-value. But as it turns out, the final scene in its entirety (fellatio and all) is one of the most touching pieces of cinema I've witnessed in recent years. It gives meaning to the whole film and rewards the viewer with a tremendous sense of humanity. Any man who's known life enough to have felt longing for a lost love, loneliness, lust and guilt can relate to what Gallo is expressing.I quite liked Buffalo 66, but The Brown Bunny clearly surpasses it. It's heartfelt, original and real. Oh, and before you judge this film as being pretentious, go see The Polar Express.",The Brown Bunny
186,phatboycooly,Lets think for a minute?,10,24 December 2004,"The way this movie was done was great. Most of the movie is long scenes with usually no diolouge. Usually all you see is roads. But that is the point. It is tough being on the road. Sure the movie wasn't ""beautiful"" but was it suppose to be. The main idea is not so you will feel good about yourself afterward or leave saying ""man i'm gonna take a road trip"". Thats not the point. I also know that is not the only thing that people are complaining about when it comes to this movie. But when did movies have to follow a formula? If people could step back and see this movie with an open mind than maybe you will not necessarily like it but you will at least understand where Gallo is coming from. Stop expecting things and just enjoy them for what they are. Vincent Gallo is a great director and is gutsy. We need more people like him in this world.",The Brown Bunny
187,cwgian,one of the most haunting and intimate films ever made,10,30 December 2004,"SPOILER!at bottom, this is one of the very few authentically American ghost stories.the alienation of Bud is as ""real"" as any in corporeality of a ghost ...the hauntingly long travel shots -(1)show sections/aspects of the country seldom explored in typical road movies (from mid-income, east coast suburbia to the hotel-existence of California) and (2)create such a sense of an empty waste land - a Sheol ... a real hell (maybe purgatory) .. with dust instead of flame, and longing and wandering for torture (a punishment like some classical Greek or Israelite land of shades, aimlessly shuffling about).and, daisy..... the hope, the light at the end of all this, evaporates in the very moment of bud's attempt at life ... she is yanked from us in the seconds of a post-orgasmic bliss/peace and becomes, instead of said hope, the devil of accusing guilt.Gallo needs be honored with the very few ground-breaking artists that our country's young aesthetic(only 200+ years) has given the rest of the world .... along side Poe and Pound, Whistler and Gardner.",The Brown Bunny
188,upsguy1979,Gallo is an artist,10,27 February 2005,"I think this film is a great work of art! The way he shows the loneliness and thought process of an individual is very true and very real. Hell I can relate with those same experiences of thinking constantly of a lost love. What I especially loved about the Gallo's movie is the way it didn't follow the TYPICAL formula of every movie that comes out today. God forbid someone were to march to the beat of his own drum! And as a reply to the previous comment of this movie, it was in no way a snore fest. In all the lonely scenes of Gallo, the absence of word help you formulate your own thoughts of what he is thinking about. Every thing about this guys film making is absolutely awesome, it is just a shame that Gallo is a republican.",The Brown Bunny
189,tomhues,As True and Devastating a Meditation on Grief as You'll Ever See,9,6 March 2005,"Vincent Gallo's movie is bound to be misunderstood by impatient film-goers, by those who have been attracted to the film only by the sensationalistic reportage of the oral-sex scene, and by those people fortunate enough not to have been experienced a tragic loss in their lives. But to people whose days have been marred in that way, the true theme of this movie is apparent very quickly, from the point when Bud picks up the wan girl working at a small-town gas station, pleads with her to go to California with him, only to abandon her after she agrees to go with him. I wasn't sure what ""The Brown Bunny"" had in mind. But the minute Bud speeds off in that van, the damaged heart of this film and who it it still beating weakly for came immediately into view.Gallo does beautiful work throughout this film. I don't know if he's suffered a significant personal loss in his life. But if he hasn't, he proves himself an intense observer and interpreter of the ways in which deep injury hollows out a person, in this case Gallo's down-and-out motorcycle racer. He makes it painfully clear that there is no cure for this terrible condition, no matter what attempts one makes to fill the void. Not even a desperate hallucination of the grotesque consummation of sexual longing, an thoroughly unconvincing castigation of his lover and her ultimate repentance.With that hopelessness followed hard by the horrifying, inevitable memory of the dreadful truth of the lovers' final evening together, the ultimate truth of this story will never stop haunting Gallo's character.""The Brown Bunny"" left me shaken. But Gallo makes a significant achievement by getting inside the the cryptic sensibility of the grief stricken with extraordinary acuity. This film will never appeal to a mass audience. It wasn't made to. It's a movie made specifically for people who have unfortunately learned its forlorn language. It is a language that we all foolishly hope we will never to have to understand.",The Brown Bunny

Getting old sucks but the Dago Woody Allen will have a difficult time re-inventing himself next time: ""The Prostate Affair (Always Gotta Go)"" written and directed by Vincent Gallo.Plus how did he get away with a real porn scene? Wouldn't that make the movie X-rated? Seriously, this guy is Woody Allen born Italian Catholic. Like Camille Paglia and Anna DiFranco, still unwashed wops from the provinces of upstate NY. Christ, am I glad I was born and braised in NYC.Have cousins in Middletown...I don't know, out-of-towners are destroying NYC.",The Brown Bunny
191,kimik-1,The Rabbit Died,1,21 August 2005,"Vincent Gallo once again proves himself to be the only member of his fan club. He is easily the single most pretentious, least talented narcissist in Hollywood. He gets a writing credit? There was a script? The full range of his acting is touching his face and/or hair. In fact his hair is a better actor than he is. I know Vincent thinks no one understands his vision and it's him against the world and in this case he's right. Is there some sort of constitutional amendment that could ban him from filming anything ever again? Ham -handed attempt at every turn (all the women are flower-named) What happened to Chloe Sevigny?She built a career only to make amateur porn for nothing. Only positive is that time actually stands still while viewing. Pretentious, self-indulgent, boring beyond comprehension.",The Brown Bunny
192,darla-jones,Dreadful Waste Of Time,1,24 August 2005,"With very little dialog and very little action and entertainment, i found this movie to be a dreadful waste of my time. I haven't used the fast forward button so much in my entire life....and this coming from a big fan of Gallo & Sevigny. Of course, i did find it very sexy and erotic that the Sevigny engages in oral sex with Gallo. And that Sevigny was apparently really doing the ""work"" herself. But that just wasn't enough to make the hour and a half or so worth while for me. I just feel like it was far too long of a wait to get to that one scene that it wasn't worth it. And the incessant driving shots that amounted to nothing, other than a glorified road trip. And finally, Gallo was so soft spoken that the little bit of dialog included in the movie i could barely hear, with my TV set all the way turned up. Just a waste of a Wednesday night if you ask me, all I know is I am glad I rented it and didn't spend the extra money to go to a theatre.",The Brown Bunny
193,zanaguedroit,Piercing spirit,10,21 December 2016,"Motorcycle racer's road leads to women that do not match his spiritual context. The women try to escape their own vanity; disarmed of answers about their nature, they meet in poignancy, verbal absence and part in dismay.If the very first version of the movie lasted forever, it would be about right. A total presence of Bud Clay in his self journey with the all-pervading sense of death has no equals. Vincent Gallo the actor alienates in the women's land, scattered as a flowers' field, he isolates as a driver of the eternal conflict - to be loved, to love. This conflict is so real and near, that those who are not touched, can only be diverted to the entertaining plots, let's suggest, Fun in Acapulco (1963).The events and memories unfolds in an unusual pattern of time, taking the film out of a framed composition. Bud Clay's needs are visible, yet unpredictable; no clear answer can be found to explain the reason. The spectator understands the cause of his feelings towards the end of the movie, when Clay's shard of glass is broken in the scene with Daisy.Vincent Gallo the director appears as an engineer of the film's unique emotional DNA, as an architect of an intricate interior of our psyche and conscience, as well as an anti material painter of America's landscape. In the light-years V.Gallo has been measured as a goldsmith of interesting filming. Being a little less blind, the spectator is presented with a possibility to undergo a nowadays rare, unsimulated film luxury, serving saturated visual and auditory imagery. Imagery reluctant to leave You a good while, after the journey has reached a no destination.People that find watching their toe nails grow more interesting, can find their jealousy satisfied and be deprived of seeing later Vincent Gallo film, for the director's boat is too gracious to moor at their unsound shores.",The Brown Bunny
194,bamf984,I just don't know,4,29 September 2005,"OK, first off I really like Vincent Gallo. Buffalo 66 is a great film, and the numerous others he has acted in were always to par. Now with that said Brown Bunny was a horrible film.... plain and simple. Vincent, you had a great idea and decided to waste it on 90 min of crap. Although I liked the ending, the first half of the movie was pain staking to watch. No one with any real appreciation for cinematography or independent film can say this is a great work of art. I think you should still watch Brown Bunny and decide for yourself. I'm remaining optimistic for Vincent's next film, because I really do think he is a talented film maker.",The Brown Bunny
195,lutzypie,You will not be indifferent to this movie,7,17 October 2005,"Vincenct Gallo has created a highly personal movie that is both monotonous and painfully stirring. Now, how do you do that? You blatantly defy formula in both the movie's pace and it's climactic punch relative to it's pace.The movie chronicles Bud Clay's (a motorcyclist) journey from a race in the Northeast to his next race in California. The ""chronicling"" is what makes the movie unique. It's almost entirely internal. We are witnessing a man's depression, and turmoil through a few interactions with people but mostly through long shots of lonesome highways with Bud's unkempt locks cropped in our blurred peripheral and the road-worn windshield framing our seemingly unending journey into highway damnation. Gallo also prefers to offer visual proof of haunting and loneliness through exaggeratively long shots of his face alternately sleepless and slightly morose. These shots are almost exclusively in quarters that suggest self-isolation and abandonment of society.The few interactions Bud has with characters are very revealing partly due to the audience's heightened desire to see Bud with people. This makes the audience acutely observant and truly desirous to get to the bottom of this man's pain. The interactions also reveal their commonality to Bud's reclusion and set-up the controversial payoff later. And LATER is a key phrase for the impatient. The film's allure is not to be enjoyed in real time, only following the film's end. This is what makes the movie both painstaking and powerful.",The Brown Bunny
196,keith-curtis,Give it back,1,23 November 2005,"Gallo owes me $2.50 for the rental and 90 minutes of my life back. This movie made me wish i was blind or retarded so i couldn't comprehend the sheer lack of plot in this movie. Watching him drive around is like a tortuous trance that you cant break free of. They should torture all the inmates of maximum security prisons with this movie minus the fellatio scene which is real and it is the only good part in the movie, but overall i give this a one if there was a way to give this a negative number i would i would rather watch Manos hands of fate or Monster a go go cause at least those movies are funny bad this movie is just plain bad !!!HORRIBLE!!!",The Brown Bunny
197,kirstybubblesbonbon,Alternative title,4,30 October 2005,"This film could have been called ""Blow Job"", been 5 minutes long, cost less, gathered a larger and more honest audience and made more money. I am a fan of Vincent Gallo's work but just wondered about this film and his reason behind writing the only scene the film will be remembered for. Many would write a scene like that and put themselves in the starring role if they thought they could get away with it, he has and it's quite funny if you really think about it. If you are curious about it, get the film and go straight to the scene where Chloe Sevigny appears. The rest just isn't worth watching, it's all about the blow job. Be honest with yourselves.",The Brown Bunny
198,ofer1353,you are stupid,1,30 October 2005,"this was absolutely the worst movie of all time, i watched on fast forward to make it less monotonous (scene changes occur much more rapidly) the mere fact you liked it makes me wonder what drugs you had been smoking. The burnout scene was amazing, because they were no scenes of him driving, this movie makes me want to kill things, namely asshole directors that don't even understand their own movie. I did like the oral sex scene, but he has a small penis, and i didn't get to see it cut off, as this is the prescribed punishment for said movie. That van was ugly anyway. by the way, you and your pompous attitude pisses me off, go back to France you frog!",The Brown Bunny
199,wroble26,this sucks,1,29 April 2006,This was truly the worst movie I've ever seen... even worse than Godfather part 3 which was the worst movie i'd ever seen until now. I literally fast forwarded through the entire thing. The climax (no pun intended) was the pornographic blow job which in my opinion wasn't done well either. I think this whole movie was just a plot for the director/editor/producer/lead actor to get a little action. It is the worst low budget film. You can see why he had to produce and do everything himself because no other real film maker in his right mind would have anything to do with this movie. Please save your $2.00 and your sanity and never rent or buy this movie. I am saving you from 94 minutes of pure hell.,The Brown Bunny
200,kurtjmartin,brown bunny,5,25 November 2005,"I felt the film could be condensed to 30 minutes, too much road time. I feel Gallo could be a big star he has the look, the brooding, and the gods were kind to him down stairs. I would have like to had more background on Clay and Daisy's relationship from when they were children to the present. I did not find myself lost in the story. Clay was not developed to the point that we knew who he was. Did we like him or not? Who was Daisy who was Clay? They grew up together but it seems even with several years together he was ready to give up on her almost immediately. There was a lot of room to develop the people so the viewer knew them.",The Brown Bunny
201,midnite263,"""THE BROWN BUNNY"" is deep !!",10,26 November 2005,"I loved this movie.Vincent Gallo,is a genius.he was able to make me feel exactly what Bud Clay,was feeling,the pain,the grief,the guilt,the loneliness,the cross country drive,a perfect occasion for reflecting. All enough to make a man cross that thin line between sanity and insanity.The way Gallo, put the viewer right in the front seat as Bud Clay drives across country is a definite stroke of genius in that it makes the viewer feel what Bud Clay,was feeling. Its a craftily done,tragic love story wrapped up in a mystery and near the end of the movie in that motel only then was the mystery unraveled and the tragic love story revealed.Once i watched the whole movie i had to watch it again to truly appreciate its genius.It shows that one does not have to have a big budget to make a big movie....",The Brown Bunny
202,britt-30,This movie sucked...,1,30 November 2005,"I absolutely hated this movie. It movie is filled with trivial moments that don't add to the plot (man peeing; man washing face; man showering) and other moments that seem to go on forever (man driving man driving man driving man driving man meeting and kissing woman man driving man driving man driving). All of this is ""artistically"" framed by shots of Gallo's hair. You get the picture. In fact, I've just covered most of the movie's content for you. And if you go so far as to read the back of the movie case, then you know 95% of the flick already. Just fast-forward to the final 10 minutes for the really disturbing stuff. Which is also apparently the point. Which is as uninteresting as a tantalizing scandal that happens in some other town, far far away. And it's not worth the build-up. Take a hint from the packaging: This is a movie written by Vincent Gallo, and he's also the producer, the director AND the lead star. He's also involved with the photography and the music. You really get the sense there's been no outside input, nothing critical added or, more importantly, edit out.Sounds like on-screen masturbation? Well, if you consider the motorcycle in the movie as a phallic symbol, then, yes, it really is.If you value your time, and if you don't really want to see Gallo's hair and over-inflated ego, then avoid this movie altogether.

203,pyhrrus,Guy + Van + Pointless = Brown Bunny,1,9 December 2005,"Give me a break. It's a movie of a guy riding around, trying to replace something lost, and what he lost was absolutely nothing special whatsoever. No dialogue worth speaking of, and camera work that wreaks of the effort of trying to seem artistic. If you want to see a guy ditch a minor he just seduced at her own house though, try this movie out. I mean in all honesty, I am not a big fan of indie films or mainstream Hollywood films, but tend to take everything on a case by case basis. If a movie is good, I'll credit it, regardless of the artistic camp from which it hails, and in this case I'm going to say that this was by far possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.",The Brown Bunny

The image of the absurdly beautiful meeting in the park with the character played by Cheryl Tiegs (""Lily"") -- it doesn't have to be ""real,"" the imagination here is much more powerful than reality. This kind of imagination is not cheaply saccharine, its bitterness and horror ranks it with some of the leading visionaries and image makers of our day (I am even thinking of the genius of Bob Dylan's soul/song). I only lament that time spent watching ""Bud Clay's driving"" might have been edited out of the film. This time, ""driving there"" is magnificent and heart-breaking... like Wim Wender's ""Kings of the Road"" (""Im Lauf Der Zeit"")or ""Alice in the Cities"" (""Alice in den Stadten"") - either you ""get it"" or you don't.

207,imdb-12288,At the time of writing this film had scored 5.1/10,8,2 February 2006,"I believe that this seriously low score is misguided! I think that if a film is slow, nowadays, it puts people off. I don't think it is spoiling the movie for anyone by saying that a glacier would defeat this movie in a race. Another example would be Lost in Translation. I know a number of people who complained that LiT was too slow and thus bad. And AI, by Spielberg. Relax, I say. Take it easy! Go with the flow.Without giving too much away the ending packs a visceral punch and is undoubtedly explicit. Avoid if this kind of thing is not for you. However if you're an adult (I'm not trying to be uppity here) and are prepared to experience what life has got to offer, you won't go far wrong with this flick.Do not be expecting Buffalo 66 part 2.

Think less atmospheric road movie, more like someone driving around wasting film in a van with a grubby windscreen. Any accidental cinematographic highlights trawled up in this way are swamped by a surfeit of interminable similarity.The context of the film is of no evident relevance to the denouement - the plot is unconvincing in layout and execution, and acting just doesn't enter into it. This appalling misjudgement fails to make it entertaining even in a ""so bad it's good"" way. Most infuriatingly for me, when there is finally some dialogue that reveals the rationale for the show, Gallo adopts an unlikely squeaking caricature of a whining voice which blows away the last scintilla of credibility almost as hard as Sevigny sucks.Memorable if only for being a serious contender in the ""worst film ever"" stakes, but will give hope to incompetent porn auteurs the world over.",The Brown Bunny

Without hesitation he purchased it, that night Chris, Myself, and My friend Jesse sat down and watched it, it was strange to me at first, I had seen maybe three or four ""Artistic"" films in the past, so this style of filming and dialogue (or lack of) was all very new to me. In a way it scared me when Vincent Gallo's character Bud Clay, who is a motorcycle racer, picked up only girls with the names of flowers, and just getting them fast for then dropping them off. It didn't quite make sense to me why Bud decided to drive nearly half way across the country one night, but it was interesting and kept me watching (the utter brilliance and beautiful camera styles were as good of hook as any other modern movie) It all came together during the ""blowjob"" scene at the end, it wrapped up all the loose ends but still left me in complete awe. Vincent Gallo has lived an interesting life and is an extremely talented Directer/writer/everything possible in this world. The majority of his movies never make it to the states in English but you can hunt them down in a subtitled form, I would highly recommend Buffalo '66.",The Brown Bunny
