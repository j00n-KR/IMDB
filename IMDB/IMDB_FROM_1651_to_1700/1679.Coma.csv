0,bkoganbing,Too Horrifying To Contemplate,8,9 June 2008,"In Coma young idealistic doctor Genevieve Bujold comes upon a practice that she finds too horrifying to contemplate. Patients are deliberately put into comas and then sent to an institute where they are kept mechanically alive so their body parts can be sold to the highest bidder. She tries to tell her boyfriend fellow physician Michael Douglas about what's happening, but he's not buying it. He's very much attuned to hospital politics and there's as much of that in the medical field as any other.Michael Crichton's novel is turned into one creepy movie that gets creepier by the minute as Bujold uncovers more and more of the story. In her performance Bujold manages to hit the notes of idealism, vulnerability, and toughness at the same time, not easy to do. Bujold for instance, scared as she is, proves quite the match for Lance LeGault who's trying to kill her.Some others in the cast are Richard Widmark, head of the hospital medical staff where she works in Boston, Rip Torn the very well connected head of anesthesiology which seems to be where the problem lies and Lois Chiles whose case sparks Bujold's interest.Making early film bit appearances are Ed Harris and Tom Selleck. But the performance that will totally creep you out is Elizabeth Ashley, head of the institute where all the coma patients are warehoused. She makes Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest like Mary Poppins.Coma is a fine thriller of a film and those last few minutes with Bujold quite vulnerable will have you on the edge of your seat.",Coma
1,Leofwine_draca,A quite wonderful '70s conspiracy thriller,9,21 April 2016,"A top-notch suspense thriller from Michael Crichton, the man who gave us WESTWORLD and JURASSIC PARK. Unlike those rousing crowd-pleasing adventure yarns, COMA is a film which works on subtlety, building up a level of quiet suspense unseen in all but 5% of such would-be films. Yes, this is great stuff, with tons of atmosphere and suspense, great acting from the entire cast and a large, complicated (yet easy to follow) plot with far-reaching implications. There are so many great scenes in COMA that it's hard to keep track of them. There's a wonderful stalking sequence in which Bujold finds herself being chased by a murderous mystery man, which makes the best use of a hospital I've yet to see in a movie - forget the gory, boring HALLOWEEN 2, this is the real stuff and with not a drop of blood to be seen. There's also a really nail-biting climax which had me on the edge of my seat - something which only a small handful of films are capable of doing.Following in the footsteps of other '70s conspiracy films like THE CONVERSATION, COMA lets the plot unfold at a slow pace, building up pieces of a jigsaw until it all falls into place with a horrific clarity. Genevieve Bujold is excellent as the smart and sexy young doctor who acts as the eyes and ears of the audience, as we follow her journey and never get ahead of her in her investigation. The camera-work and music is also great, with fine locations (the Jefferson building couldn't look more sinister) and some excellent visuals, like the famous shot of the comatose bodies suspended from wires in a warehouse. The action set-pieces are well handled and stick in the mind (like the murder of the janitor, for instance, which has the best on screen death by electrocution I've seen).Bujold is supported by a familiar cast of old and new faces, all of whom put in fine turns. Michael Douglas is the misunderstood boyfriend who helps Bujold in her research, while Richard Widmark has the fun role of the evil mastermind (don't worry, it doesn't take much to work that out) behind the illegal organ donation scheme. The rest of the cast includes Tom Selleck as a victim, Rip Torn as a doctor and a chilling turn from the guy playing the hired killer; it's a shame I don't know the actor as I'd keep an eye out for him. COMA takes the audience on an epic journey, is gripping at all times, and simply one of the best conspiracy-thrillers out there. 100% recommended.",Coma
2,SnoopyStyle,a better second half,7,26 October 2015,Dr. Susan Wheeler (Geneviève Bujold) and Dr. Mark Bellows (Michael Douglas) are resident surgeons in Boston Memorial Hospital and are living together. Her friend is a patient who falls into a coma after surgery. There has been a series of comas in the hospital. Susan starts investigating and stepping on many toes. Mark plays politics and is pressured to reel in his girlfriend. Susan discovers that all the comas come from one operating room and the patients get transferred to Jefferson Institute for long term care.Michael Crichton directs and adapts the novel by Robin Cook. It's got some very good paranoia thriller vibe during the second half. The first half can be a grind. Crichton is not the best at pushing the pace when the story isn't at its most intense. He could have had some help. Geneviève is not always the most animated actor. Her investigation could have been more compelling. It is an interesting movie with a great twist.,Coma
3,Hitchcoc,Not So Random Harvest,7,24 December 2016,"This threw out the possibility that at some point, when money talked loudly enough, those who could afford it could bypass the the organ transplant protocols and simply buy their substitute organs. That's a possibility, but like the grave robbers of the 19th Century, with a shortage of lungs and hearts and livers and kidneys, perhaps one needs to harvest them in a whole new way. Genevieve Bujold plays a young doctor who comes to realize that healthy people in her hospital have a high incidence of coma. When she investigates, it becomes obvious that she is being kept from the truth; more than that, her life is probably in danger. This movie was controversial. Robin Cook's book was a big bestseller. Certainly provocative but not as good as it could have been.",Coma
4,mark.waltz,"I must have been in a coma to have missed ""Coma"".",10,5 May 2021,"Yes, I know that this movie existed from the time that it came out and I've never not know that it existed. But why have I avoided it? Could it be the strange poster which left me cold, or just fear of what it would be about? But as I go through the many films that for some reason I skipped over the years (and had access to while working in the video rental business), I come across many that I regret not seeing earlier, and I must say that this ends up not only being one of the best films of 1978 but one of the best science fiction mysteries ever made.There is a scene early in the film that made me laugh at myself. Genevieve Bujold and Michael Douglas are colleagues who happened to be lovers and live together on a part-time basis so they can see how compatible they are. When they both get home at the same time, Douglas intends to take a shower but Bujold insists on going first and asks Douglas to heat up the dinner she has prepared. She is uncompromising and hard nosed, and I asked myself ""what's with her?"". Had Douglas done it, I probably wouldn't even have flinched. So the fact that a 40 plus year old film made me see things from a female point of view and made me laugh at myself for unintentional misogyny really got me into this film and taking a deep look at Bujold's character.Recently, I watched the film ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" again and the fact that this is a decade after her sole Oscar nominated performance shows me what a versatile actress she was and how powerful she could be in films, the Judy Davis of the 1970's. All eyes are on her in this film, and while some of her demands initially seem impossible to get, her motivations once she begins to see that something in her hospital is very wrong become all encompassing and you can't help but root for her to expose the corruption that is revealed and truly disgusting.Her interest in the large number of comatose patients at her hospital begins when her best friend is operated on and ends up in a coma. She does research with the lab department and the records department and what she discovers has her both scared yet determined to reach a conclusion and find out exactly what is going on and then stop it from continuing.Michael Douglas maybe the leading man but the focus is on her. Their initial scene doesn't really show the passion in their relationship which is explored in more romantic detail later on. Veterans like Rip Torn and Richard Widmark are excellent, and a sinister Elizabeth Ashley gets to steal every moment that she's in. I think this ended up being forgotten because it came out early in 1978 which prevented it from getting any recognition at the award shows, and for that reason, it sat collecting dust on video store shelves which is perhaps why I overlooked it when I pulled an evenings worth of entertainment off the shelf for me. Other classic film viewers hopefully won't make this mistake because this is indeed tops in its genre, and a new favorite to add to my list of films I will highly recommend to anybody who loves classic, unique cinema.",Coma
5,classicsoncall,"""I think we have to call this delayed return to consciousness of cryptogenic origin.""",7,5 February 2017,"The main problem with the film watching it today is that it's almost four decades old as I write this, thereby having quite a dated quality to it. The story itself is a pretty good one with an element of suspense supported by the idea that maybe something like this could actually happen. If you think about it, the ebay for body parts concept is in full play today for important organs like the heart, liver and kidneys, so who knows if in the deep, dark recesses of medical malpractice something like this might be going on even now.What will really blow you away is when the story moves over to the Jefferson Institute and you get to see all those comatose bodies suspended in mid-air waiting for who knows what. That was just the absolute worst stuff of horror one could imagine if you were somebody like Dr. Susan Wheeler (Genevieve Bujold) investigating the sudden 'deaths' of patients coming out of Operating Room #8.So with all the possible nightmare conspiracy thoughts going through Wheeler's head, I was rather surprised that the story reverted back to a 'keep it simple' strategy by the outlaw doctors running this little medical scam. The carbon monoxide strategy filled that bill perfectly, but gee, wouldn't you think Dr. Bellows (Michael Douglas) could have just burst into the operating room when his girlfriend was on the table instead of taking the long way around through the labyrinth of storage rooms and duct work? At least he made the save, for a while there I thought he was in on the whole body parts business himself.Like any job I guess, one gets somewhat blasé about the work conditions and every day boredom that might set in, so that scene of the pathology residents, (one of which was Ed Harris) discussing 'complete squash rot' and 'total gomer' to describe their autopsy patients was a bit of comic relief for this viewer. If this film had been made about thirty years earlier, you might even have seen them lighting up a smoke as they went about their business.",Coma
6,gavin6942,A Michael Crichton Thriller!,7,6 October 2015,"When a young female doctor (Geneviève Bujold) notices an unnatural amount of comas occurring in her hospital she uncovers a horrible conspiracy.Maybe I am just too young, but I think of Michael Crichton as really blossoming in the 1990s. He had ""ER"", he had ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Congo"". It seemed like the height of his career. And yet, here we have 1978, he is already directing a very strong thriller. Maybe not well remembered compared to his other projects, but you still have a great movie with Michael Douglas in a big supporting role. (Bujold, though not as big of a name, has at least as distinguished a career.) ""Coma"" was Tom Selleck's first theatrical appearance. He would later work with Crichton again in the 1984 sci-fi thriller ""Runaway"". Composer Jerry Goldsmith would also work with Crichton on ""Runaway"", contributing his first--and only--all-electronic score.",Coma
7,lee_eisenberg,take a deep breath,10,21 August 2018,"A few years after directing ""Westworld"" and a few years before writing ""Jurassic Park"", Michael Crichton directed this eerie adaptation of Robin Cook's ""Coma"", depicting sinister occurrences in a Boston hospital. Part of the fun is watching the plot slowly but surely unfold, with only Geneviève Bujold's character suspecting that something is up. The other part of the fun is seeing the early appearances of Tom Selleck, Ed Harris and Philip Baker Hall.Admittedly, some of the scenes are dated (Mark telling Susan to get him a beer even though they're both surgical residents, Dr. Harris putting his hands on Susan's face, and the general lack of privacy, confidentiality or security). But even so, it's one fine movie. This one and ""The Hospital"" (1971) are the ones to watch if you're on a bender for movies about eerie events in medical facilities.",Coma
8,Woodyanders,An excellent medical thriller,8,15 November 2018,"Spunky and determined Dr. Susan Wheeler (a terrific performance by Genevieve Bujold) suspects that something is amiss at the hospital she works at after a large volume of healthy patients develop complications while undergoing routine operations that cause them to slip into comas.Writer/director Michael Crichton relates the gripping story at a constant pace, expertly crafts a considerable amount of nerve-wracking suspense that develops in a gradual, yet steady manner, and wisely puts a pronounced enhance on the story and characters over any fancy gimmicks or loud fireworks. Moreover, Crichton grounds the premise in a thoroughly believable workaday reality which in turn gives this movie an extra chilling edge.Bujold simply shines as a highly sympathetic and courageous protagonist who's super easy to root for and care about. Michael Douglas also does well as Susan's skeptical boyfriend Dr. Mark Bellows who initially seems like kind of a jerk. In addition, there are sound contributions from Richard Widmark as tough, but fair administrator Dr. Harris, Elizabeth Ashley as the sinister Mrs. Emerson, Rip Torn as the stern Dr. George, and Lance LeGault as creepy assassin Vince. Lois Chiles and Tom Selleck have small roles as ill-fated patients while Ed Harris makes his film debut as a pathologist. Kudos are also min order for Victor J. Kemper's slick cinematography and Jerry Goldsmith's chilling score. An on the money nail biter.",Coma
9,moonspinner55,Genevieve Bujold: one tough cookie!,8,7 April 2002,"As a squirrelly doctor at a Boston hospital who smells a rat when her best friend mysteriously goes into an anesthesia-related coma during a routine operation, Genevieve Bujold proves once again what a dynamic presence she is on the screen. Cool-headed one moment, hysterical and running-in-all-directions the next, she's instantly identifiable to us. As a mystery-thriller that is so filled with continuity errors, gaps in logic and a final act that gives the audience the satisfying release it needs but at the risk of all credibility, ""Coma"" shouldn't work (and, indeed, many fans of Robin Cook's wordy book didn't think it did). However, as a trashy, one-box-of-popcorn melodrama, the film is very enjoyable and suspenseful. Not the least of the reasons why it's so good is Bujold; handling herself like one of the best crime detectives ever concocted, she is gutsy, feisty, nosy and infectious. You never tire of her spirit. *** from ****",Coma
10,Coventry,"Okay, I'm worried",8,27 December 2009,"The story of ""Coma"" is perhaps a very simplistic one, but nonetheless this is one of the most disturbing, thought-provoking and unsettling medical thrillers ever made. Moreover, I'm seriously relieved that neither myself nor any of my closest relatives is due to check into the hospital for any type of 'routine procedure' any time soon, as one single viewing of this film is enough to make you paranoid and suspicious about everything that might be going on there. Susan Wheeler is a young and promising resident surgeon at the acclaimed Boston Memorial Hospital who, following her own friend's simple abortion gone wrong, begins to investigate the unusually large number of spontaneous comatose cases. Apparently, and during the past year alone already, more than ten totally healthy and young patients fell into a coma after seemingly routine surgical procedures. Dr. Wheeler suspects a conspiracy, especially when it turns out all patients were treated in the same OR and transported to the mysterious Jefferson Institute afterwards, but the entire medical staff – including her ambitious fellow surgeon and lover Mark Bellows – revokes her attempts to prove it. I was seriously surprised to eventually find out how rudimentary the denouement of ""Coma"" in fact is. The mysterious occurrences and Dr. Wheeler's private investigation lead towards a fairly logical and even somewhat predictable conclusion, but still it I must admit it left me disturbed and speechless. This is entirely Michael Crichton's earning, as the screenplay is very careful and thrifty with the revelation of elementary story elements and twists. ""Coma"" basically could have been a rather short and straightforward thriller, but Crichton expands it into a compelling and sometimes even somewhat overlong mystery thriller. I've read in the trivia section of this website that both the author of the original novel, Robin Cook, and writer/director Michael Crichton hold a doctor's degree. This is clearly noticeable in the dialogs and automatically turns ""Coma"" into a far more plausible and respectable medical thriller. Believe you me, I've seen numerous hospital slashers of which the dialogs didn't contain any medical terminology at all and that is quite pathetic to observe. ""Coma"" works terrifically as a tense and nail-biting thriller, but admittedly it isn't the most exciting movie ever made. The development of Dr. Wheeler's research keeps you on the edge of the seat, but the actual action and suspense sequences are tedious and overdone. The assassination of maintenance witnesses, for example, is completely gratuitous and even Susan's hysterical escape from the Jefferson institute feels dragged in just to appeal to fans of the more exploitative 70's thrillers. The cast is stupendous, with glorious roles for Genevieve Bujold and Michael Douglas and delightfully suspicious roles for Rip Torn and Richard Widmark.",Coma
11,Hey_Sweden,Tops of its kind.,8,13 January 2019,"Author, screenwriter and occasional filmmaker Michael Crichton does an impressive directing job with this slick, well-paced medical conspiracy chiller which Crichton adapted from the Robin Cook novel. Genevieve Bujold is a compelling heroine as Susan Wheeler, a headstrong second year resident at Boston Memorial Hospital. When her best friend (Lois Chiles) goes in for a routine procedure, and ends up in an irreversible coma, she's naturally devastated. But she's also TOUGH, and she's determined - nay, hellbent - on finding out what happened, especially after the same exact thing happens to another patient shortly afterwards.Bujold is wonderful as this feisty, single-minded pursuer of the truth, and she is put through her paces as she hides among cadavers, clambers through ducts, flees from a creepy hitman (Lance LeGault), and visits the Jefferson Institute, where the sight of many patients suspended in the air makes for a memorable image. She must also wonder about her boyfriend Mark Bellows (Michael Douglas), a fellow doctor, and how much she can trust him.Crichton knows how to craft an engaging thriller, one that moves along so steadily one may hardly notice that it takes up the better part of two hours. He also has a way with suspense, as there are numerous close calls for Susan. It's a good thing for her the Jefferson Institute can't boast the worlds' most efficient security staff.Scored effectively by Jerry Goldsmith (whose music supplements the movie without automatically calling attention to itself), ""Coma"" is thoroughly engaging. Even though there's much medically-oriented dialogue that would go over the head of the layperson, Crichton still gets all of the salient points across.Douglas is good as the boyfriend, Rip Torn glowers superbly as a haughty anesthesiology expert, and Richard Widmark remains great value as Susans' superior, who tries to be supportive of her. The variety of familiar faces in supporting roles and bits includes Elizabeth Ashley as a tour guide, Hari Rhodes as a psychiatrist, Tom Selleck as upbeat patient Sean Murphy, and future 'Growing Pains' mom Joanna Kerns as Diane (she would later headline another Cook adaptation, 'Mortal Fear'). Ed Harris made his feature film debut here as a pathology resident.Utterly absorbing from beginning to end, with Crichton wasting no time in getting the story started; the opening credits are finished in just over two minutes.Eight out of 10.",Coma
12,preppy-3,Excellent medical thriller,9,5 March 2003,"Patients check into the (fictitous) Boston Memorial Hospital for routine operations and, inexplicably, go into irreversible comas. Dr. Susan Wheeler (Genevieve Bujold) wants to know why much to the disappointment of her doctor boyfriend (Michael Douglas). When she tries to find answers, she finds herself marked for death.Michael Crichton directed from Robin Cook's great novel. There are huge gaps in logic, but the film is so exciting and entertaining those can be forgiven. It's fairly well-directed and well-done overall. There are many great sequences--Bujold being stalked by a killer in the hospital late at night; a visit to the creepy Jefferson Institute; some lovely views of Cape Cod MA; Bujold, and then Douglas, tracking a suspicious oxygen line and the ""accidental"" death of a janitor. Also there's Jerry Goldsmith's loud, pounding score moving the picture along and, best of all, this was shot on location in Boston.The acting is so-so. Douglas and Bujold are OK as the leads. Richard Widmark is having the time of his life playing a hospital administrator. Rip Torn and Elizabeth Ashley also turn in good performances. Also look for Tom Selleck, Ed Harris (with hair!) and Joanna Kerns in bit parts.A very good movie. However you do have to deal with some very dated dialogue of Bujold trying to make it in a ""man's"" world. Also be aware that this is pretty extreme for a PG rated movie--there are fairly clear shots of Bujold's body during a shower scene and plenty of nude, dead bodies in a freezer sequence and some really gruesome scenes throughout the hospital.This film has disappeared for some reason. It caused a lot of excitement around here when it was filmed in 1977 and was a big hit in 1978. Then it just disappeared. That's surprising considering how the careers of Cook, Crichton and Douglas have taken off. It deserves rediscovery.",Coma

Susan's best friend Nancy Greenly (Lois Chiles) has a seemingly routine abortion carried out but never regains consciousness, Nancy is diagnosed as brain dead & is comatose. Susan investigates the circumstances surrounding her friends coma & discovers a high rate of young, healthy patients who mysterious come out of routine surgery in a coma. Susan's investigations take her to the Jefferson institute where the coma patients are taken & where she finds out the horrible truth...Written & directed by Michael Crichton this is a pretty decent thriller. The script is slow going at times which is a shame because it can become a bit tedious in places, it sets the basic situation up of people mysteriously ending up in coma's but then doesn't do anything with it for ages as we see Susan search for the truth. This is OK & it provides a taught enough thriller but I just wish it was a little bit more eventful & not quite as long. The basic story is interesting, it's as much a psychological horror as thriller as it plays on our fears about Hospitals. Places where we go to be healed & cured, the notion & idea that these sacred places could be used for evil gets to you on a basic level & in that respect the story is effective. Unfortunately the film is rather ponderous & takes absolutely ages to do anything with the idea & even then I felt the eventual end was a bit of an anti-climax. This is a good solid thriller for sure but I wouldn't call it a classic by any stretch of the imagination. The character's are good, the dialogue is OK & the story is interesting but I just couldn't help but feel a little bored while watching it.Director Crichton is usually better known for his big budget screenplays like Jurassic Park (1993) but he turns in a relatively tight & taught thriller even if it's a little slow going at times. There's a nice atmosphere to it & the seeing the comatose patients in the Jefferson institute hanging by wires is sort of creepy but there isn't many out & out scares, it's a film which constantly tries to build the tension until a big climax which as I said I don't think was as good as it could have been.Technically the film is very good, it has that Hollywood polish about it. Actually shot on location in Boston in Massachusetts. The cast do a good job & the acting is fine, this was an early role for Michael Douglas & as such isn't the star while Tom Selleck has a small role & loses his kidneys.Coma is a decent thriller that entertains to an extent, there are some interesting ideas & notions but it's all just a little bit too slow going & unspectacular for my liking.

16,Boba_Fett1138,A well build up thriller but its improbabilities prevent this movie from being a '70's must-see.,7,14 August 2006,"Leave it up to movies from the '70's to deliver a movie with a well build up tension and a realistic suspense. This movie is one of those typical well build up thrillers from the '70's, that however in the end still falls sort of flat, due to some improbabilities in the story.The movie begins slow, perhaps unnecessarily slow, to set up the characters and their relations. It does give the movie a certain sense of realism and at times suspense but it also provides the movie with some unnecessary long sequences that don't really add enough to the movie and its style. It's has '70's written all over it but the movie is not as 'experimental' as other genre movies from the same period. The cinematography by Victor J. Kemper is without any fancy tricks and the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is (disappointingly) simple. All indications that this movie was made in the late '70's. It still has '70's style but without all the movie technical experimental elements, like genre movies from the more early '70's. It does make this movie more watchable for a wider audience.Basically from a technical point of view, the thriller elements in this movie are well build up and executed in the movie but unfortunately the story itself is filled with too many loose ends and improbabilities to consider this a perfectly made thriller. Too bad, since the premise itself of the movie is quite good. Especially in the end the movie becomes more and more unlikely. For instance why only just O.R. 8? Wouldn't that just arouse automatically suspicious after a while? And why does Susan Wheeler keep returning to the hospital, were she knows that she has more enemies than friends. All logically flawed plot elements that causes the movie to be a bit unlikely and not always credible as a thriller.It's nice to see that the main character of the movie is a female. Geneviève Bujold delivers a strong performance in the main lead. I don't know, for some reason the movie also becomes more realistic because of that the main lead is a female. With a male lead movies like these too often and too easy turn into heroic macho movies, which are not halve as credible. The movie also has a very solid supporting cast, with lots of actors that later grew out to be big ones, such as of course Michael Douglas but also Rip Torn, Tom Selleck and Ed Harris, who portray some much smaller roles.Overall this still is one fine typical '70's thriller. As long as you can see past its flawed script and don't expect too much of a masterpiece, you'll certainly enjoy watching this movie. 7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Coma
17,view_and_review,This Movie Grew On Me,7,20 December 2019,"A 1972 movie titled ""The Carey Treatment"" featured a sleuthing doctor trying to expose a cover up of a death. 1978 gave us another sleuthing doctor, Dr. Susan Wheeler (Genevieve Bujold).""Como"" grew on me which proves that patience pays off sometimes. Initially, I didn't particularly like the main character, Dr. Susan Wheeler. She was moody, pushy, and overbearing. She had this perpetual sourpuss look on her face that matched her overall attitude.When her best friend fell into a coma after undergoing a routine D and C procedure Dr. Susan began her quest. I don't think she was sure what she was looking for, but she stepped on a lot of toes while looking. She was clumsy, irreverent, and lacked tact which only hurt her chances of finding the truth. Eventually she got to the truth of her friend's coma, but a different approach could've yielded faster and easier results. As she states in the movie, she was never one for hospital politics.With all her flaws, she was right, and that's really all that mattered. She found that the massive conspiracy was real. She took on the establishment and struck a mighty blow. Now, how severe of a blow she delivered we don't know because the movie ended with a camera shot of a defeated antagonist, Dr. George (Rip Torn).The ending was a bit deflating because, whereas we got one thing--Dr. Susan surviving her fake surgery, we didn't get another--to see the whole corrupt system come down. The implications were there, but a lot of movies will give the viewers more meat than this movie did. Many times, you get to see the perps being arrested or killed even. In Coma we are left to our own imaginations as to what happens next. For all we know Dr. George could've made everything normal with no corroborating evidence to put him away.Partially unsatisfying ending aside, this was another gem from the mind of Michael Crichton.",Coma
18,AlsExGal,"Ah, the 70s!",7,10 March 2019,"This is a real time capsule in many ways, and yet it is a very good thriller that still holds up. A surgical resident in a large Boston hospital, Dr. Susan Wheeler (Genevieve Bujold), becomes suspicious when she investigates why her best friend, a healthy young woman, becomes brain dead after minor surgery. By infiltrating the hospital's computer system she finds all of the people who have become comatose after surgery in the last year, and finds ten who were young and healthy among them.But considering that the hospital does 30000 operations a year, ten patients is statistically insignificant. And yet Wheeler keeps digging. The truth is something that is easy to believe post Watergate, which had ended a presidency just three years before.How is this a time capsule? Well there are the numerous statements about Wheeler being a hysterical woman, even from her significant other, Dr. Mark Bellows (Michael Douglas). Boy does Douglas play this one emotionally timid and meek. He is miles from the role of Gordon Gecko he will play ten years later that will win him the Oscar, but then he said in his early career he tried to avoid playing angry fuming types so he would not be compared to his famous father.Then there are the sexual mores of the 70s. Two employees are having casual sex on the floor when Wheeler visits the hospital lab. (""No Mrs. Baker we cannot explain why there is sperm in your blood sample, can you?""). And the surgery Wheeler's best friend comes in for? It is an abortion, and the surgery is actually shown and discussed in the film like it is no big deal. That would never happen today. It would never have happened in film just five years later in the Reagan years of the 80s.There are other issues, but I will leave it at that.

In which case it makes this movie a very effective movie as well. Also, it seems to be the first movie with the title of Coma made in a rather long list of them here at the internet movie database. The movie is about a hospital where there is something amiss. Seems a good number of the patients are going into comas after surgery and most of them are seemingly patients that are in relatively good health for the most part. One young lady doctor suspects something is wrong and she works to uncover the truth. You also have Michael Douglas who does not really believe her when she starts to find things out. All in all a rather good mystery thriller type movie written by the guy who did Jurassic Park and other science fiction type novels. It is entertaining for the most part, but it also has a few slow stretches of film as well. However, I can not deny that when I had a surgery years after I had seen this movie this movie came to mind when I was going under.",Coma
22,The_Void,Decent 70's thriller,7,22 May 2005,"While Coma isn't quite good enough to be considered a 70's classic, it's still a very decent thriller and is one that is thrilling enough to be given that name. The film draws on the fears of people doing terrible things in secret and also the idea of what goes on while you're under the anaesthetic while having an operation. The film's plot follows the mysterious goings on at a hospital after several patients slip into comas. Of course, comas are a normal occurrence at hospitals; but it's happening far too often for Dr Susan Wheeler's liking, and so she sets off to find out the truth behind what's happening. But sometimes, the truth is too difficult to take. Because of the way that the film draws it's plot, the overall atmosphere is one of paranoia; and the movie taps into this with the viewers in order to make itself interesting. Throughout the film, the audience is never really certain what's happening and the way that the film holds certain cards towards it's chest until they have to be played gives full credit to the assured plotting.The film is typical of the seventies because of it's bulky plotting and the way that the action is forced onto the viewer. The seventies was a definite golden age for cinema, and although this isn't one of the golden films of that era; it shows that it was the golden age because even the lesser seventies films did what they set out to do, which is something that cant be said for this day and age. The acting in the movie is largely good, especially when you consider that this movie is closer to the 'b' side of cinema than it is to the 'a' side. The acting in 'b' movies often leaves a lot to desire, but I'm happy to say that isn't the case here. Geneviève Bujold, despite having roles in a few notable releases (such as De Palma's Obsession and Cronenberg's Dead Ringers) never really got noticed enough to be a star, but still does well here. Her opposite number is Michael Douglas, which despite only being a co-star really, still manages to do well with his role. On the whole, I don't recommend having high hopes for this one...but it is worth watching.",Coma

24,ShadeGrenade,A medical Watergate?,10,3 August 2011,"If you find hospitals scary, don't watch this. Based on the bestseller by Robin Cook, and brought to the screen by Michael Crichton ( the man behind 'Westworld' and 'Jurassic Park' ), it is a terrifying exercise in Hitchcockian suspense. 'Dr.Susan Wheeler' ( Genevieve Bujold ) notices that a number of healthy people have been lapsing into comas during routine operations. All have happened in the same operating theatre. The comatose patients are then shipped off to the mysterious Jefferson Institute. When Susan's best friend Nancy ( Lois Chiles, later to appear in 'Moonraker' ) also lapses into a vegetative state, Sue investigates, uncovering a conspiracy led by Dr.Harris ( Richard Widmark ). The Jefferson Institute is illegally using the bodies for medical experiments. Attempting to expose the scheme, Susan is herself then drugged and sent off for an operation. It is down to her boyfriend, fellow doctor 'Dr.Mark Ryland' ( a young Michael Douglas ) to try and save the day...French actress Bujold showed tremendous promise in 'Anne Of The Thousand Days' ( 1968 ) but sadly never lived up to it. Not her fault. The scripts she was offered were mostly poor, such as the execrable 'Swashbuckler' ( 1976 ). 'Coma', though, is an exception. Anyone who thinks movies in which women are the main characters are a relatively new invention should be made to watch it. Douglas' character, by comparison, is a supporting one.'Coma', even when viewed thirty-three years later, is strong stuff. Scenes such as Susan being shown round the Jefferson Institute and encountering dozens of bodies suspended in mid-air are horrifying to this day. When an assassin follows her into a room full of vertically-stored corpses, she pushes them and they topple on top of him like falling dominoes. The suspense is highlighted by a typically brilliant Jerry Goldsmith score.Things To Look Out For - one of the doomed patients is a young Tom Selleck ( future 'Magnum P.I.' ).Film versions of books are often inferior, but 'Coma' does not dumb down the story. If anything, it is better. Cook's novel was badly let down by a weak ending. The film's climax, however, is right on the money.",Coma
25,JamesHitchcock,Macabre Medical Thriller,6,5 April 2007,"A young woman named Nancy Greenly goes into hospital for a routine abortion, but something goes wrong during the operation and she goes into an irreversible coma. Susan Wheeler, a young doctor at the hospital was a close friend of Nancy, and when she starts looking into her friend's death she finds a disturbing pattern. Over the last few years the same thing has happened to numerous young, relatively healthy patients during routine operations. The numbers are far higher than would be statistically expected, but when Susan tries to voice her concerns she is met first with complacency, then with obstruction, and finally with threats that her career will be at risk if she persists in investigating this matter. Even her boyfriend and fellow-doctor, Mark Bellows, refuses to believe that anything sinister is going on. Undeterred, Susan continues to investigate, only to find that she has stumbled upon a horrifying conspiracy and that her own life is in danger.Today, a plot like this would seem quite commonplace; the Hugh Grant vehicle ""Extreme Measures"" from the mid-nineties is so similar to ""Coma"" that it virtually qualifies as an unacknowledged remake. In the seventies, however, such a plot probably seemed much more original. Although there were exceptions, such as the sadistic surgeon played by Charles Coburn in ""King's Row"", Hollywood had hitherto generally portrayed the medical profession in a good light, so the idea that doctors and nurses could be murderous villains rather than selfless, idealistic healers was no doubt shocking.The film also makes good use of its setting. As another reviewer has pointed out, many thrillers make use of dark, claustrophobic settings, so it must have been a challenge to the ingenuity of writer/director Michael Crichton, himself a former doctor, to conjure up an atmosphere of suspense in a cold, clinical, brightly lit hospital. (Alfred Hitchcock took on a similar challenge in ""North by North West"" when he succeeded brilliantly in creating a sense of menace during the crop-duster sequence, set in daylight in the flat, wide open Illinois prairie). Some of the suspense sequences in ""Coma"" have a particularly macabre quality to them, especially the scene where Susan is menaced by a villain in a refrigerator filled with corpses in body-bags.Michael Douglas (in one of his earliest starring roles as Mark) is adequate but seldom more than that. He gives little indication that he was on the verge of stardom as one of Hollywood's biggest names of the eighties and nineties. Genevieve Bujold, however, is rather better as Susan, making her an attractively determined heroine, and there are good supporting performances from Richard Widmark as Dr Harris, Susan's paternalistic boss who may not be all he seems, and from Elizabeth Ashley as Mrs Emerson, the weird, zombie-like nurse (a sort of Stepford Wife of the medical world) at the sinister Jefferson Institute where the coma patients are taken. One can also spot a few stars of the future in minor roles, such as Tom Selleck, Ed Harris and Bond-Girl-to-be Lois Chiles as Nancy.There are (as others have pointed out) a number of holes in the plot- I could not, for example, understand why the medical establishment of the hospital were so complacent about the number of patients they were losing to coma. I won't detail the other plot-holes as to do so would be to give away too much of the plot. These are not, however, the sort of weaknesses that are likely to spoil one's enjoyment of the film, but rather the sort that become apparent when one sits down to analyse it later, or when one sees it for a second time (as I did recently). Some commentators have called this film ""Hitchcockian"". Whereas in quality it is by no means up to Hitchcock at his best, it is a reasonably exciting, if modest, thriller. 6/10",Coma

27,lasttimeisaw,"a paranoia-driven conspiracy theory headlined by a tenacious heroine, but its backward coup de théâtre recoils on itself",6,19 March 2018,"American Science Fiction author Michael Crichton's second venture into filmmaking after dipping his toes in grinding out a futuristic WESTWORLD (1973) which is in dire urgency of a retrofit (here comes HBO's popular TV series), COMA is not from his own novels, but transposed from his friend Robin Cook's book (which also receives a TV re-interpretation in 2012), it cleverly taps into a paranoia-driven (our mortal fear about hospital and surgery), conspiracy theory routine that takes place in a major hospital in Boston and is headlined by our tenacious heroine Dr. Susan Wheeler (Bujold).After her best friend Nancy (Chiles) succumbs to a brain-dead coma after a minor surgery, Susan acutely sniffs some goings-on on top of the statistic hokum of bad luck, her pursuance of the truth will duly encounter mounting resistance, but nothing can hold her back, neither the bureaucratic pressure nor a ruthless killer trailing her among the cadaver-riddled hospital rooms in the witching hour. She even goes out on a limb and sneaks into a formidable institution on her lonesome to finally solve the puzzle and miraculously finds an exit route. Yet, just when we are astounded by her moxie and wits, she predictably makes a fatal mistake and throws herself on the mercy of the vile ringleader to be silenced on the operation table by carbon monoxide poisoning, only to be rescued by her knight-in-shining armor in the eleventh hour, as an ostensibly female-centered trend-bucker, that final phallocratic deed is tastelessly self-defeating. What is more excruciating is the portrait of the aforementioned knight, Susan's boyfriend and colleague Dr. Mark Bellows, played by a flip Michael Douglas, often gratingly plays the contrarian whenever a stressed Susan propounds her theory, and Crichton rams the hovering question into his audience by implicating that he might be complicit in the whole backdoor human organ trafficking, simply to pull off the kicker and feather the movie's deceitful macho nest, don't forget, he is the one who would rather staying in his car and leaving Susan alone to visit the sinister-looking facility in the first place, plus, if he were really such a perfect dreamboat, it would not have taken him until that later phase to realize that something is amiss. While it is the imagery of horizontally floating comatose patients (all young, fit bodies, for practical and aesthetic reasons), that chiefly subsists the film's dimmed allure, there is no denying that a pert and competent Ms. Bujold makes for a strikingly sympathetic heroine, in spite of Crichton's carefully veiled comments on women liberation, as Mark frustratingly mutters, he should have fallen in love with a nurse instead, which strikes her as a frigid, lippy woman whose femininity is subdued by her own aptitude. Finally, two supporting turns are worth singling out here, an authoritatively stern Rip Torn can always give us goosebumps even without uttering one single syllable; whereas a blink-refraining Elizabeth Ashley knows perfectly how to put impersonality to the fore, her Nurse Emerson could be intricately computer-manufactured herself, to more align with the drift of Crichton's works.",Coma

Although, when Dr. Susan Wheeler's friend happens to be one of those casualties, she takes it upon herself to dig in deep, about this strange occurrence, as the frequency and cloud covering it seems to be way too fishy. Soon, she finds herself in one big conspiracy that just doesn't want to be found out with plenty of obstacles blocking her path and no one believing her.No wonder why hospitals can give you the wet-willies! Director / screenplay writer, Michael Crichton's ""Coma"" is a glum medical thriller with a very scary idea and builds suspense and intrigue up like Hitchcock flick. The secret web of crafty turns and unpredictable patterns, works extremely well with its cleverly planned out and thorough script, which takes its time in setting up the mystery and paranoia edge. It's truly effective in that department, but I did find to be overdrawn and finish with a too soft of an ending. The compatible looking production gives the film a little more credit and a certain slickness to its B-material. Yeah, it's b-stuff, but the key is, it's done very well with it opting for a more serious outlook despite the silly nature of it all when you look deeper into it. In patches it does get quite nagging and I found it hard to actually connect with the bitter heroine in this piece. The story doesn't particularly flesh out these characters, but really, they are secondary to the morbid actions occurring. Genevieve Bujold gives in a true performance as the headstrong Susan Wheeler, who puts her nose where she's not supposed to, but I found the character very unlikeable and frustrating. Michael Douglas who shares the screen, basically isn't given too much to do, but he's fine in the co-role as Wheeler's sceptical boyfriend / fellow doctor Mark Bellows. Richard Widmark gives a tip-top performance, Rip Torn is fair and so is Elizabeth Ashley. In bit parts, are Tom Selleck and a creepy looking Ed Harris. Chiming in is Jerry Goldsmith's kinetic score that's truly on the alienating side and crisp photography gives the film a real nice shine when capturing the cold and sterile setting. Novelist / director, Crichton, does a efficient job in the director's chair and he frames some well-executed, blood curdling and nail biting scenarios.The thriller ""Coma"", provides a good dosage of ghoulish entertainment.

31,gbill-74877,Forgive it for its plot holes,8,1 April 2017,"I'll start by saying there is a plot hole in 'Coma' large enough to drive a giant truck through, which will have almost all viewers absolutely howling. There is also some pretty poor acting from some of the supporting characters, particularly early on in the movie, and an overall feel that makes one think of 'made for TV' films from this time period. Stick with it, it gets better. Lastly, because we know at least most of what's going on pretty early in the film, a good portion of the potential tension is lost.And yet, and yet. Michael Crichton knew a good story when he saw, it and shows us one that was ahead of its time, touching on organ farming and the computerization of hospitals all wrapped up in a creepy conspiracy, and with a little feminism mixed in besides. Geneviève Bujold is fantastic as the surgical resident who early on makes it clear to her boyfriend, another resident (Michael Douglas) that she won't be pushed around in their relationship. She then begins investigating some odd circumstances surrounding patients at Boston Memorial Hospital who unexpectedly go into comas following routine surgeries, including her close friend. Douglas is good, and it's interesting to see Tom Selleck and Ed Harris in minor roles, but Bujold stars here. You can probably sense where the film is going, but it may surprise you a bit along the way, and there are several memorable scenes in the second half.

The hero is a heroine, a doctor at a major Boston hospital. The actress is French Canadian Genevieve Bujold, a slight but strong character, one of the first of the admirable women leads in movies in the New Hollywood and feminist aftermath (thankfully). In truth, she is admirable if sometimes stubbornly solitary in her pursuit of the evil she has uncovered at work.And that evil is a series of unexpected comas in young patients, including her best friend (who has gone in for an abortion in this Roe v. Wade era, under the guise of a less politically loaded procedure). This leads to more sensational aspects that I leave to you to uncover.By her side, either for her or against her (you can't tell after awhile) are two huge Hollywood names, an aging Richard Widmark as the head of the hospital and a young Michael Douglas as another up and coming surgeon (and Bujold's lover). The politics as well as the medical ethics get increasingly mixed up in sensational trashy novel style, which is exactly what this kind of movie needs. It's fun, quasi-realistic, interestingly speculative, and overall well made.Yes, well made and well directed. Crichton pulls of his second full Hollywood production off with conviction. It feels like a routine, well made, Hollywood movie from 1978--it would have been terrific at a good drive-in, and it's great at home, too. Just to be sure, the movies at the time that were more inventive and impressive included ""Deer Hunter"" and ""Midnight Express"" to name just two.

Genevieve Bujold and Michael Douglas star, both very highly acclaimed and rightly reputed, as are supporting actors Richard Widmark and Rip Torn. Additional supporting roles go to Tom Selleck, Ed Harris, and Lois Chiles, and film composer Jerry Goldsmith bears no little renown of his own.With all these names to draw our eyes, I'm not sure how I went through so much of my life without seeing this, but it was worth the wait.The narrative begins with a strangely high number of patients falling comatose at a prominent Boston hospital. Our protagonist, Dr. Susan Wheeler (Bujold), investigates with personal interest when her best friend also falls victim, and that mystery quickly spirals into a much more sinister secret.The plot makes for a devilishly thrilling story all by itself, but also dovetails neatly into persistent and understandable - if misplaced - fears and suspicions in the real world. Medical institutions, and medicine broadly, are essential, life-saving facets of our modern society, as beneficial and trustworthy as any branch of self-correcting science could be. Yet like anything where humans are involved, they are also prone to corruption, whether by capitalism, prejudice, unaccountability, or a general shirking of responsibility. Even if one has never been deliberately mistreated by a doctor or otherwise medical practitioner, we've all experienced the hardship that comes with the bureaucratic morass of merely seeing to our medical needs. 'Coma' happily plays in the murky space where anxieties and conspiracy theories meet, and readily preys on that tiny voice in the back of our heads that says, ""Yes, it's fiction, but..."" to bolster its own suspense.There's not a great deal more to be said.

The first half is an immersive, completely believable depiction of hospital life (Crichton was a medical student at Harvard) - the cast seem more like medics than actors - whilst the second is a delirious, nerve-wracking fantasy of assassins, murderous chases, futuristic cryogenics and political coverups, and the shift from one to the other is seamless. Bujold is convincingly out of her depth but determined to uncover the truth, and Douglas is the ultimate don't-rock-the-boat corporate climber, forced to make fundamental decisions about who to believe. Both are excellent, with strong support by Widmark, Ashley and Torn as the heavies, and nice bits by Chiles, Selleck, Doyle and a young Harris. There's also a great blaring unmelodic score by Jerry Goldsmith that twists the knife and very spooky photography by Victor J. Kemper and Gerald Hirschfeld. I find it disappointing that Crichton hasn't made more films, because although he's a great writer it's his directorial style that really scores - his grasp of visual grammar, suspense and eye for spaces in the frame. Most movies made by writers-turned-directors (e.g. Sleepless In Seattle) show little visual flair, whereas by contrast Crichton's movies are full of imaginative effects (see Westworld and Runaway particularly). Coma has a big set-piece chase sequence through the deserted hospital which is spectacularly creepy and unsettling, and the Jefferson Institute scenes are just breathtaking. With the possible exception of the work of David Cronenberg, this movie taps into everything that has ever unnerved you about doctors and hospitals, and is one of the finest conspiracy thrillers of the seventies.",Coma
43,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Terrifying Possibilities,8,9 April 2019,"This was a film I was turned on to by a horror film encyclopedia I've been working through. This one was intriguing to see that Michael Douglas starred and that Michael Crichton was the writer and director. I did come into this one as blind as I could. To get into this, the synopsis is when a young female doctor notices an unnatural amount of comas occurring in her hospital she uncovers a horrible conspiracy.We follow a couple of young doctors that are currently residents at a Boston hospital. There is Dr. Susan Wheeler (Geneviève Bujold) and Dr. Mark Bellows (Michael Douglas). They are dating, but they have their differences. Mark is really active in the hospital politics and wants to become chief resident. Susan on the other hand doesn't really care. The two of them get into a fight as Mark doesn't give her the respect that she deserves. She leaves to go back to her place.Mark does try to apologize the next day at work, but she refuses to get lunch with him as she goes to a dance class. It is there we meet her best friend Nancy Greenly (Lois Chiles). She is talking about how she thinks she might be pregnant and going in for an operation. Things don't go as planned though. She ends up in a coma even though it was supposed to be routine.Mark notices that it is Nancy and pages Susan. She comes down and looks into what happened to her friend. It is here that she noticed there are a higher number of patients that are ending up in comas. The problem though is that none of the procedures are the same and the patients are all from different walks of life. She is told by her boss, Dr. Harris (Richard Widmark) to drop it. This causes her to buttheads with the head of anesthesiology, Dr. George (Rip Torn). The more that she looks into this, the plot thickens and there might actually be something going on in this hospital.I didn't want to reveal too much more information about this story as I did find it to be quite interesting and the mystery is something that is fun to piece together. This really is scary concept. It is fitting that Crichton did this film, because I was a big fan of the TV show ER so I knew that he actually went to medical school. You can see that in this film as it does get real technical in showing how some procedures are done, explaining things and listening to the doctors' talk.Going from there as well, this is a terrifying concept. My parents have both had operations where they had to be put under and I know for my mom, who worries about pretty much everything; this is one of her biggest fears. I try to put her to ease, but after seeing this film, I could see something like this happening. I won't reveal what or why it is; just know that it is nefarious for good reason and morally wrong.This film also does something else pretty interesting for its time. The film is from the late 70's and I do know that feminism had its rise. Dr. Wheeler is definitely a modern woman who is strong. She gets into it with Mark who is there to play the game to move up. She is trying to make her way and it is more difficult for her, because she is a woman. I like that she won't take no for an answer and that she is out to find the truth of what is going on, even though it is getting more and more dangerous.The pacing of the film is really good as well. It definitely moves through things and builds the mystery pretty early on. If anything, the film goes to the realism side of working in the medical field and I think that could be toned back. It doesn't focus on it a lot, but when it does, it goes all in. The mystery as I stated from the story is interesting and I think it is well structured. How the film ends I thought was really good as well. I never got bored even though the film runs almost two hours.Acting is something that was really strong in this film as well. Bujold I think did a great job. She is such a strong woman that is trying to make her way in a profession where we can see that the men run. She doesn't want to politic and really just wants to do everything on her own merits. I like that she doesn't bend to their will. I did also find her attractive and her accent was intriguing. Douglas was interesting as well because he is a solid actor. Mark is trying to work his way up and he's playing the game. He isn't a horrible guy, but he does demean Susan even if he doesn't mean to. Torn and Widmark are both solid in their roles and I think the rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well.As to the effects in the film, there really aren't a lot of them and it doesn't need to them to be honest. I've touched a few things on the realism of the medical procedures being done, so we do get that. Things are used properly and we see things that doctors did at the time. There is this crazy scene in the Jefferson Institute in the film. I'm not sure if it is real or could be done, but it was futuristic and wild. The film was shot really well and it does have a feel of a TV movie as well.Something else I found interesting was the soundtrack of the film. For the most part it didn't stand out to me. There are some scenes though where it almost sounded like Friday the 13th or along those type of films. It didn't necessarily fit, but for some reason, I dug it. The score didn't stand out aside from that, but it also never took me out of the film.Now with that said, this film was quite intriguing and one that I don't really hear people talking about. It has an interesting concept and one that could legitimately happen. I thought the film was also progressive in Susan's character and the portrayal by Bujold definitely helps there. The rest of the cast was solid. I thought the pacing was good. There weren't really the need for effects, but we do get some realism there and the soundtrack really didn't stand out for the most part. It never hurts the film which is good. Overall I'd say this is a good film and worth a viewing.",Coma

It's right-up-there with that old Twilight Zone episode where everyone's face is distorted and normal looking people are considered hideous-looking. Once the method of ""murder"" (O.K. the victims are only just almost-dead) is discovered, the movie goes downhill quickly and ends soon afterwords, as it should.

48,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Suspenseful and creepy medical thriller,9,28 July 2014,"Susan and her loving boyfriend Mark are both intelligent doctors working at a large hospital. After Susan's best friend ends up in a mysterious and unexplained coma, Susan uncovers a conspiracy at the hospital which involves putting random patients into comas to use them for organ harvesting. Unfortunately the hospital staff are killing anyone who tries to help her find information, and she's their next victim. What's shocking in this film isn't so much the hired assassin or the comas, it's the fact that a hospital, which is there to help everybody who is sick, has so much disregard for human life that they'll kill people and sell their organs for money without thinking of the families and friends of the victims. In reality there is a big debate over whether or not organ harvesting is ethical and moral. Organ donation occurs every day, but there is consent from the donor. In this movie there isn't. However, there are several stories about human vivisection and taking organs from living people in third-world countries, which is really very disturbing. And although my country has free health care most countries do not, you must have medical insurance to receive care. It is true, hospitals care more about money than life these days. The acting of all characters was exceptional, and the ending was very suspenseful, when Wheeler herself was to become the next victim of the coma plot. The background music was pretty eerie. The movie itself was based on a novel written by the king of medical thrillers, Robin Cook. Decades later Coma was adapted into a TV miniseries. A similar movie was filmed in 2008 that shares elements of Coma, the horror film Autopsy. It's really worth watching, especially if you're a fan of horror that points out real-life issues. If you're a fan of Robin Cook's works you'll love this movie.",Coma

""Coma"" tries to answer this question in a Hitchcock-ian fashion, creating a creepy atmosphere as it goes along and its effort is admirable, but the end result sadly doesn't satisfy the hopes. Convincing anybody that in order to try and save patients needy of organs other random healthy patients are killed, is absurd and beyond imagination of the greatest fool. In 90% of my comments I never summarize the plot but the villainous doctor's ""reasoning"" that it's better to kill healthy people in order to save sick patients than just leave the healthy people be is so stupid its offensive.But if you cut the last 10 minutes ""Coma"" is fairly decent and the leading lady, a sort of version of a much more feminine Sigourney Weaver, quickly grows on you.

The premise is decent, a hospital employee believes that the hospital that works at is killing people and using the corpses for some reason, but its executed very poorly, with dull pacing and plotting, which will leave many viewers bored out of their minds. The only plus is that you get to see Ed Harris in one scene before he was bald. I think age has also done a number on the film. The one scene that was once somewhat spooky just looks campy now.

Douglas refuses to believe her until Bujold ends up on the operating table, whereupon the mystery is satisfyingly solved, and the bad guys are brought to justice.Very creative film has powerhouse acting and directing, is incredibly suspenseful, and the ending is superb.

It still makes the hairs on my neck stand up, one of Crichton's scariest films.The movie takes place at Boston General hospital. The two main characters, Michael Douglas(Dr. Mark Bellows) and Genevieve Bujold( Dr. Susan Wheeler). The two doctor's have a rocky relationship. They love each other, but they can get on each others nerves. Dr. Wheeler is a doctor who is smart and doesn't get the respect from some of her colleagues , because she's female.One day her best friend, Nancy Greenly goes in for a simple procedure, but does not wake up. She is in a Coma, on life support. When Wheeler finds out she is devastated, she wonders what went wrong? She is so upset she tells Mark, he explains to her that something must of happened with the anesthesia. At first you don't know if Bellows is on her side or not, because he doesn't seem that concerned. Then when another patient comes in for knee surgery, Sean Murphy(Tom Selleck) the same thing happens to him. Wheeler does some investigating, and finds out the two surgeries were done in OR 8. It gets around to Dr. Harris( Richard Windmark) about her snooping and she needs to drop it. In order to keep her position at the hospital she must also see a hospital psychiatrist. She is also warned by Bellows and this starts to put a strain on him , and his promotion. Bellow explains that these are powerful people, especially Dr. George(Rip Torn); the head of anesthesiology.She ignores the advice and finds out these coma patients are taken to The Jefferson Institute. A center for long-term coma care, among other things.One day Mark and Susan go away for the weekend, upon returning they pass The Jefferson Institute. Once there Wheeler is already suspicious. There she meets the nurse( Elizabeth Ashley). Susan believe she is getting closer to the truth and the answer lies her at the institute. She also thinks Mark is involved which really drives her into more hysteria. She learns that people are deliberately being put into comas. The next day one of the custodians approaches her, and tells her how they do it. When she goes back to the hospital to find out the mystery, she realizes she is being followed. The fixer( Lance Legault) chases her though out the hospital. She discovers the custodian has been killed, and how they are putting people in coma's. she is getting closer to the truth because of the looks she gets in the doctor' lounge especially by Dr. George. He dislikes her because she independent and nosy. She doesn't know who to trust, that day she arrives at the institute for the tour. Once there she finds out everything, the Jefferson Institute is a front. They are really harvesting and selling human organs to the highest bidder all over the world. Wheeler's next step is to find out who is behind it. Once back at the hospital She and Dr. Harris have a discussion about it. He is the the one who is behind it; and wheeler doesn't realize this until he tries to kill her. He schedules an unnecessary surgery, telling the other staff it's her appendix. He will try to kill her while making it look like an anesthesia reaction. When Mark arrives he doesn't think anything of it until Dr. Harris demands OR 8. It will be up to Mark to try and save her before it's to late.Coma is a classic suspenseful medical thriller. When I had my first surgery in 1998, all I could think of was this movie. We all think doctor's would do their best, when our lives are in their hands. COMA shows the dark side of the medical profession, that we hope never will happen. A great film I would recommend to anyone, a true classic.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Coma
53,poe-48833,"""Hospitals... are the cathedrals of our age...""",9,30 January 2017,"Absorbing thriller, with taut direction by Crichton, an outstanding performance by Bujold and yet another spectacular score by Jerry Goldsmith. The notion of harvesting body parts is definitely still Timely (and I'm not talking about the inane fuss kicked up by politicos vying for funds regarding abortion or stem cell research or any of the rest of it): not long ago, former Vice president Dick Cheney needed yet ANOTHER heart replacement and managed, magically, to move to the head of the line of people waiting for heart transplants. What happened THERE...? COMA suggests possibilities. And the remark about hospitals being ""the cathedrals of our age"" has never been truer. (I had a doctor tell me once that I had six months to live. I divested myself of all the things I'd accumulated over my lifetime that I planned to ""sit back and enjoy in my old age"": a vintage collection of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine; scores of collectible comics; books by the hundreds (including a complete run of paperback reprints of THE SHADOW from the late '60s, most in mint condition, and almost every single one of the Robert E. Howard collections from the same era, ALL of them in mint condition), etc. Seven months later, I went back to talk to that same doctor. I wanted to know WHY he told me that I had six months to live.

When nobody takes her seriously she starts an investigation of her own and then realizes she is on dangerous ground for someone is trying to stop her even if she has to die.Michael Crichton takes the most from Cook's book and assembles a most enjoyable thriller with tension all along, intrigue and an impacting ending too. Among the shocking and powerful sequences this movie offers there's the chasing of Wheeler by a hired killer that lasts in the hospital's morgue full with dead bodies hanging from the ceiling in transparent plastic bags in a sort of subrealistic scene; her visit to the mysterious Jefferson Institute where coma patients are held; the ""accidental"" death by electrocution of a cleaning employee of the hospital that knows to much; and the final discovery by Wheeler of how things are and who is behind them.Genevieve Bujold gives a fine performance as the stubborn Wheeler and Michael Duoglas is alright too as her work partner and lover (not a very demanding role anyway). Rip Torn (the surgery chief) and Elizabeth Ashley as a sinister nurse credit the supporting cast. And there's finally Richard Widmark very convincing as the Medical Center's Director who shows sympathy for Wheeler although he believes she's just a trouble maker that could ruin the Hospital's reputation.A great thriller that constantly improves as the film goes on.

If she and Michael Douglas are both doctors, on doctors' salaries, why are they both living in that cramped, squalid apartment? At the Jefferson Institute, how do both Ashley and Susan Wheeler go into that room fool of suspended bodies without any shades on, when they all had to wear shades during the visit? If Susan Wheeler is at her wits' end, why does Richard Widmark only give her the weekend off? If the janitor knows that they are using carbon monoxide to put patients into comas, why does he tell Susan Wheeler, don't they have police in Boston? How is the janitor killed by a high voltage electricity, wouldn't the cables be insulated for safety reasons? Susan Wheeler finds the electrocuted janitor. Why does she scream if she is a doctor? Why doesn't she do something? If she knows that the janitor was about to tell her something about odd things going on in the hospital, why doesn't she tell this to the police when they come to investigate? When her car fails to start, why does she take the subway, when on her salary, she could afford a cab? When Michael Douglas decides Susan Wheeler is telling the truth and finds a pair of pantyhose at the bottom of the ladder, how does he know they are hers? When Susan Wheeler and her colleague are discussing the skin from cadavers that got under their fingernails, didn't the medical school not issue them with rubber gloves? And, as another commentator asked, what DID happen to that guy who was locked in the freezer with all those cadavers? The film is exciting in places, but the whole thing is just a little far-fetched.

Young healthy adult patients are ending up brain dead after surgery in this hospital, and Dr. Susan Wheeler becomes suspicious when her best friend goes in for a relatively minor procedure and and never wakes up.  Her boyfriend and fellow doctor is not convinced that anything out of the ordinary is going on, but Dr. Wheeler is suspicious.  She begins asking questions and looking at hospital records. This is not taken well by the head of the anesthesia department (Rip Torn) and even less well by the head surgeon at the hospital (Richard Widmark). She does some investigative work of her own and makes a morbid discovery at 'the Jefferson Institute'.  It becomes obvious that Dr. Wheeler is being watched and that her own life is in danger before this film reaches its nervewracking conclusion.Directed by Michal Crichton, ""Coma"" is put together well with many nice touches and good performances from the actors.  The suspense builds as the story progresses and unfolds intelligently.  Genevieve Bujold is especially believable in her lead role as Dr. Susan Wheeler and Richard Widmark is very effective also.  There are some parts of the film that I consider graphic gratuitous medical scenes, such as the removed brain of Dr. Wheeler's friend (Lois Chiles) being sliced up for an autopsy and the internal organs being held by a medical person as he is cutting them open with a pair of scissors. The scenes may be realistic, but they aren't for the squeamish.  All in all, ""Coma"" is a glossy movie which moves along at a brisk pace and which has all of the fine attention to detail and suspense that many of Alfred Hitchcock's films have. I give it a 70/100 because for some reason, I just didn't warm up to this movie quite as much as I should have, although the overall quality is very good.",Coma

The petite Ms. Bujold - a surgeon - is asked to perform James Bond-like stunts (climbing up elevator shafts) and physically knocking-down the film's bad guys. There is Michael Douglas, as Ms. Bujold's love interest, who is either the film's hero or villain; but either way he is distinctly unlikeable.And then there is the finale. Without giving anything away, imagine this; a damsel in distress tied to railroad tracks. And here comes the train. And the hero.

She's too cute and likeable to die a crummy death, so you know she's going to live, thus there is no suspense and no surprises.

Naturally, everyone around her (all men of course) think she's ""been working too hard"" and needs a rest. But our heroine is not giving up.The cast is excellent.

62,KillerLord,A wonderfully adapted medical thriller.,10,29 May 2009,"Novels are best made into movies when you follow them as sincerely as possible. Of course, one can never follow a novel completely since what can be conveyed to the minutest detail in a 600 page novel definitely cannot be packed in a two hour movie. But still, when you do not miss out the essential aspects of the movie, only then can you satisfy those who have read the novel. Coma is one of the fine examples of how a movie can be made out of a good novel.Coma is based on the novel of the same name by Robin Cook. Robin Cook, being a man of medicine himself is able to present to us with great amount of realism as to how the profession of medicine can be used for commercial selfish gains. Most of his novels are set in a premise where the men of medicine are misusing their powers in order to gain wealth. The story of Coma is about a hospital where something suspicious is going on, as discovered by our lead character – Dr. Susan Wheeler.The movie then shows how her suspicions prove to be right but she gradually discovers the complexity of the plot and is then faced with a dilemma as to who can be trusted and who cannot be trusted. The best part of the movie, as is the best part of the novel is that it works in a smooth flow and makes us believe that what is being depicted is a surreal possibility and who knows – somewhere in world, it just might be the truth.For a movie that is made in 1976, the direction, screening and scripting is simply beautiful. It keeps us on the edge of our seats and gives our gray cells plenty of exercise as they try and anticipate as to what is going to happen next.

63,rcraig62,Entertaining medical thriller,8,4 May 2003,"This is a very good medical suspense thriller that kept me engaged throughout, well-acted and generally well done, replete with some appropriately disturbing images.  Genevieve Bujold plays a young female doctor at fictitious Boston Memorial hospital who loses her best friend in a routine surgical procedure that goes suddenly wrong and leaves her suspended in an irreversible coma.  From that point, the good doctor goes on a personal investigation of the case and finds that quite a few patients have met the same fate. It would be unkind to let on any more of the story, except to critique certain plot points that leave you scratching your head. Many of these have been detailed by my fellow imdb reviewers and I could throw a few more logs on the fire myself, but the Hollywoodization doesn't spoil the sinister edge to the film.              Bujold is surprisingly good in the lead role, carrying virtually the entire movie scene-for-scene, and Michael Douglas is pleasant as Bujold's accommodating boyfriend.  But the best performances are Richard Widmark as a somewhat sympathetic head of surgery, and Liz Ashley, terrific as the administrator of the dreaded Jefferson Institute conducting weekly guided tours and giving a chilling dialogue on the future of health care. Crichton's direction isn't overly inspired, but I loved the broad shot of the cold sterile Institute and Bujold and Ashley's tense first meeting and the sight of the comatose bodies suspended at varying heights is so stunning that, once seen, is never to be forgotten.  3 1/2 *** out of 4",Coma

65,Pelrad,Effectively frightening score and edge-of-your-seat suspense,10,13 March 1999,"Mystery suspense-thrillers don't get much better than this! ""Coma"" is an overlooked 1978 film that stars Canadian actress Genevieve Bujold (""Anne of the Thousand Days"", ""Tightrope"") and Michael Douglas, with surprise appearances from Ed Harris and Tom Selleck. Bujold plays a doctor who discovers that too many patients are going into unexplained comas after routine surgery. But no-one will believe her and keep rationalizing it. She soon learns that there is a conspiracy larger than could be imagined. Similar but superior in many ways to the more recent ""Extreme Measures"" with Hugh Grant. Although some may be disappointed by the weak resolution at the end of the film, an effectively frightening score and edge-of-your-seat suspense make this one of the best thrillers in history, and the film proves that modern special effects and superhuman stunts and action are not necessary to make a movie of this genre a winner. I also liked the fact that, like the ""Alien"" films, the lead role was by a female who didn't ""whimp"" out as many do in these kind of flicks. (10 out of 10)",Coma

And, lots of great actors seemed to want to work on this film.  But, for some reason they decided to make a movie that is just plain stupid. 
(The following is not a scene from the movie)  Suppose you are standing by the door to a building.  Next to that door sits a generator that is running. From that generator runs an extension cord.  You know that in 1 minute, some box inside the building is going to take the power from that cord and drop it into a swimming pool full of children.  What do you do?  Well, if you are writing the novel Coma, you unplug the cord.  If you are making the movie Coma, you run as fast as you can, following the cord through rooms and up into the ceiling where you find the box that will turn on the electricity on the pool.  You don't simply unplug that box, either.  You smash the box with lots of lots of rage.  And, you save the children.  Exciting?  Sure. Stupid?  Absolutely.  This is not a scene from this movie, but there's one there that's every bit as dumb.  And there are lots of other scenes just as bad.Don't waste your time...",Coma

It opens with a really intriguing shot of a gorgeous Genevieve Bujold driving to her work as a Dr. Wheeler, and listening to the radio on a beautiful crisp Boston morning. A film like this has the audience attention from that grab. Exposition ensues and so does a bit of crazy character development. Then, something else happens, ,a major death takes place and a real intrigue seeks in. Then, the revelation is that a crisis is concerning certain patients. Not for those who are queasy in hospitals. This film, about patients slipping one by one into a coma for no apparent reason still has enough affect to chill every one of it's audience members to the bone! All the stars are at their best with a script that-while has some of its unoticable flaws- keeps the audience in the roots of fear as they root for the lead female.

68,Paul-250,A Tense Thriller,7,11 May 1999,"Michael Crighton wrote and directed this tense and unusual thriller. Crighton is himself a qualified medical doctor, but on the evidence of this film he would appear to have no particular love for his original profession. His loss to the world of medicine, though, has been cinema's gain, as admirers of The Andromeda Strain as well as this film can testify. Like the English director Bryan Forbes, Crighton has always seemed able to produce thoughtful and original work which touches on the boundaries of normal experience, and this is no exception. Crighton gets good performances from the whole cast, with Genevieve Bujold, in particular, reminding us of what a fine actress she can be. As a doctor suspicious of certain goings-on in her hospital but disbelieved by everyone around her, including her on-screen lover Michael Douglas, she shows courage and determination (without ever losing her femininity) which is welcome in a female lead. She is also forced to question her own sense of perspective, even her sanity, as she struggles to uncover the mysteries that surround her.",Coma

I was convinced that this was a totally original scene when I first saw Valentine.  I should have expected a copycat though!  Anyways, this is a film that really sticks with you after you see it.

Geneviève Bujold was not entirely likable throughout and i kind of wished Michael Douglas was lead character as his natural charisma shows here. saying that i thought Bujold did well and blame the writing more than her for how her character turned out.Action/Suspense : An unintentionally hilarious assassination aside i really enjoyed the few chase of hide and seek sequences in second half of movie. Best being a scene in the morgue, felt like a slasher movie. The Jefferson institute scenes were also compelling and the final few minutes offer great tension as Michael Douglas races against time to save his lady on the operation table.Cameos : Lois Chiles looking lovely as a soon to be unfortunate victim. Tom Selleck rocking an awesome pre Magnum mustache and Ed Harris in his first role with a fine head of hair looking like a young Will Patton. Nudity : A surprising amount for a PG movie including Geneviève Bujold having a shower,Music : The score doesn't kick in till second half of movie but Jerry Goldsmith music helps the suspense brilliantly and improves the film as a whole.Cinematography : Depressing hospital interiors aside there is a sequence in the middle of movie where Bujold and Douglas go on a day out and it looks all soft focus and inconsistent with look of the rest of movie.Directing : Unremarkable but solid.Overall : Saw this as a kid and always had a fondness for it, revisiting it twenty years later i am happy to say i still thoroughly enjoy it, an intriguing plot, suspenseful chases and a satisfying climax make for an entertaining and solid thriller.",Coma

She has no reason to suspect any sort of foul play at work, until she looses her best friend to an accident during surgery. A deep investigation leads on to the awful truth, that her friends death was no accident, and other deaths weren't either.

The two leads play great off each other, and Jerry Goldsmiths score will send eerie vibes through you goosebumped skin!

This movie is definitely in my list of favourite movies of all time, as it has all the necessary elements that make a movie great.First of all the directing by Michael Crichton is excellent. Almost every camera shot has a meaning to it. The best scenes, however, are all the chase scenes. Every one of them captures you complete attention, notably the Jefferson Institute sequence. The general feel set throughout the movie by the directing is similar to Roman Polanski's 'Frantic', where you can feel the tight edge to the film without the help of acting or music.Secondly, the script, also by Michael Crichton, is superb. There isn't a single piece of unnecessary dialogue throughout the whole movie. The deception over who is the real Dr. George is very well written. Also, the descriptions of surgical procedures in the movie are very clear to understand.Thridly, the cast is great. Genevieve Bujold is perfect as Dr. Susan Wheeler, the doctor who is tormented by the fact that something is amiss at the hospital, but no-one believes it is true. You can really feel the character's shock, grief, horror, torment, terror etc. because of the great acting by Bujold. Michael Douglas is also brilliant as Dr. mark Bellows, Susan's boyfriend who never completely believes her story until the end.Finally, without the score by Jerry Goldsmith the movie wouldn't be nearly as suspenseful as it is. The music during the Jefferson Institute chase is very suspenseful.Overall, a must see movie for fans of a solid thriller. However, if you're looking for action and special-effects-to-the-max, this probably isn't the movie for you.",Coma

It's lingered in the back of my head for 40 years until it popped up on TCM the other night so I finally watched it and I loved it. Granted it's a little slow to get going but when it reaches the midway pont it's totally riveting and suspenseful in a very Hitchcockian sort of way. Genivieve Bujold is hands down the highlight of the film. Her performance as an independent minded female doctor is really superb. She keeps it subtle in what could have been a thoroughly over the top role for any other actress of that era. I personally feel she is one of the most underrated actresses of her generation. The themes of medical ethics, healthcare affordability and inequality of access were way ahead of their time in 1978 but very timely today. The pacing and nerve wracking suspense (which begins mid movie), builds towards a thoroughly edge of your seat climax that is intense yet subtle. Elizabeth Ashley is also terrific. Her small role is the one campy part of the movie. She delivers it with such a frigid restraint that it's absolutely devious. Definitely a great popcorn movie worth catching.",Coma

Genevieve Bujold is excellent as a doctor who feels that something sinister is behind a series of operations whose recipients have emerged comatose.A coma is the last thing that the audience is in danger of succumbing to as Ms Bujold is pursued by the agents of whoever is behind the conspiracy to turn hospital patients into organ fodder for the futuristic and scary Jefferson Institute.One of the things I hate in movies is the cheap suspense creation trick of filming everything in partial darkness or bad light ('Alien' and 'Seven' being notorious exponents of this ploy) to hide the stalker or some disturbing sight from the viewer.  'Coma' has no time for this cheap trickery and creates genuine suspense by filming the stalking of Ms Bujold in the brightly lit, but deserted, corridors of a hospital. An atmosphere of danger and menace pervades the entire film, and one is left with uncomfortable feeling that perhaps the trade in human organs for wealthy recipients may actually be going on somewhere.  (As I write there is an allegation current that the organs of criminals executed in China are sold for such purposes)Anyone who has not seen 'Coma' should do so and enjoy an absorbing, well acted and suspenseful thriller.8 out of 10",Coma

Maybe he and Genevieve Bujold didn't hit it off or that it's more of her film than his. The other actors did swell, especially Widmark, Torn and Ashley.Bujold gives an energetic performance and is utterly believable as the paranoid yet justifiably suspicious doctor seeking the answer to the question: ""There have been 12 cases of unexplained coma in young healthy patients the last year; don't you find that surprising?"" And everybody replies: ""No."" And there's of course the priceless Jefferson Institute. The sequence where the protagonists approach its sinister exterior is very well done in a Hitchcockian fashion.
