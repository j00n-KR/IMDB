0,TheLittleSongbird,"Beautiful, charming and poignant, I seriously hate how under-appreciated this movie is...",10,24 November 2009,"... and I am truly sorry it took me so long to see it. It really is as good as the other reviewers say. It is everything the film promised to be, and these were the reasons why I loved other movies like Stand By Me so much. My Girl is beautiful, it is charming and it is poignant. I have been prone to cry in movies like the Elephant Man, Fearless, Camille and Stand By Me, not to mention and you'll probably think me weird Harry Potter 6. Here, especially the ending I bawled like a baby, and I am not afraid to admit that. But what struck me most was the innocence of My Girl. The scenes with the two children are some of the most charming scenes in any film I have seen. The cinematography is beautiful and the scenery is breathtaking. The direction is next to faultless, and the screenplay has a sense of subtlety and poignancy. The film's length is perfect, and the romance between Harry and Shelley wasn't cloying at all. The music is truly beautiful, and brings warmth and beauty to the proceedings. The performances were truly professional, with charming low-key performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and Dan Aykroyd and Anna Chlumsky is wholly believable in a more complex child performance than one would expect from her. And Macaulay Culkin was so cute here, even cuter than he was in the Home Alone movies. The film also has a sweet heart warming story, that avoids becoming overly sentimental. I really hate how under appreciated this gem is. It isn't the best movie ever made, but it doesn't try to be. It is essentially a charming and poignant film, that I think critics have misunderstood in the past. It is more than a bittersweet kids movie, it is simply a pleasant little gem. 10/10 Bethany Cox",My Girl
1,SnoopyStyle,sweetest coming of age story,8,30 November 2013,"It's 1972 in small town Madison, Penn. Tomboy Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) has Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin) as her best friend. She lives with her father (Dan Aykroyd) and grandmother in their funeral parlor home. One day, Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis) answers an ad to do makeup for the funeral home.Anna Chlumsky and Macaulay Culkin couldn't be any more cuter. Anna gets to have some great funny one liners. It is possibly one of the best sweetest coming-of-age story. The romance between Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis is also lovely. I love the bumper car scene. There is probably way too many spoilers. I guess people were afraid to be shocked. The movie handles the death with class. Don't be scared off even for the kids. It's a great movie.",My Girl
2,kosmasp,My actors,8,13 June 2021,"I have to admit I had to chuchle when I read the summary line from another reviewer ""I see dead people"" ... yes it references to a movie that was made a decade after this came out ... and to a different actor (this one is with the Home alone kid Kevin - Culkin) ... but still funny.And talking about kid actors ... I probably never saw this until the other day. I would surely have remembered all the great actors who are in this, right? The answer must be yes ... anyway, so apart from really good performances by the kids and a female (kid) perspective, which was not really common back then, the movie has a lot to offer.Fun and tragic at the same time, with a powerhouse cast to boost. No wonder this spawned a sequel (which I will watch one day too - eventually) ... fine watch, if you are up for the sometimes grim story ...",My Girl
3,jboothmillard,My Girl,4,16 March 2011,"There were only four reasons I knew about this film, the title, the leading actress and leading child star, and that there was a scene that made many people cry, so I decided to try it, from director Howard Zieff (The Dream Team). Basically it is the summer of 1972 in Madison, Pennsylvania, eleven year old tomboy Vada Margaret Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is not your average young girl, she is obsessed with death, as her father Harry Sultenfuss (Dan Aykroyd) runs a funeral parlour in the house. She is also in love with her English teacher Mr. Jake Bixler (Griffin Dunne), and joins his poetry class to impress her, and she is also best friends with unpopular school boy Thomas J. Sennett (Macaulay Culkin), who claims to be allergic to everything (well, chocolate and bee stings). Harry has hired a new assistant for the parlour in the form of makeup artist Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), her job is to brighten up the corpses before they go in the coffins and are buried, at first Vada really likes her. Soon enough though her opinion changes when Shelly and her father have a date and have fallen in love, and the little girl tries a trick or two to split them up, but nothing works and they get engaged. Vada still has a strong friendship with Thomas J. though, they even get really close and have a kiss, and he is happy to hear that if she doesn't get anywhere with Mr. Bixler, she will think of him. Tragedy strikes however when Thomas J. walks towards a bees nest that was dropped onto the ground and opened up, and being allergic to bee stings he was surrounded, and he dies from his reaction. Vada is absolutely devastated by the news, and of course Harry is responsible for giving the body a good send-off, and after running out of the funeral too upset, she confesses her feelings for Mr. Bixler, who obviously lets her down, and says he is engaged. A little while after Thomas J.'s death, Vada and her father have a real heart to heart talking about the death of her mother, who died giving birth to her, and in the end she has overcome everything emotionally. Also starring Richard Masur as Phil Sultenfuss, Ann Nelson as Gramoo Sultenfuss, Peter Michael Goetz as Dr. Welty, Jane Hallaren as Nurse Randall, Anthony R. Jones as Arthur, Tom Villard as Justin and Lara Steinick as Ronda. I agree Culkin isn't on screen as much as he probably should have been, but he is a lovable character in specks, Chlumsky is actually a really good young female lead, and Aykroyd and Curtis are likable as the older characters. The film has its amusing moments, it has just enough charm, it has the alright coming of age stuff, it has the scene that will make a few people (not really me) cry, and it has the good title song by The Temptations, a quite nice romantic drama. It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers. Okay!",My Girl
4,rmax304823,Story of Childhood.,5,11 September 2013,"It's 1972 somewhere in a small Midwestern town and eleven-year-old Anna Chlumsky helps her widowed, undertaker father (Aykroyd) unwind and find a spirited new mate in the person of Jamie Lee Curtis, his newly hired cosmetologist who applies make up to the mortal remains.It's not a ""manly"" movie. It seems at time almost like straightforward autobiography, with just enough reshaping to give the narrative some structure. What I mean is, it's the kind of film of which John Wayne might have said, ""It rides a little on the gentle side."" Nothing very dramatic happens, but that's okay. It's a quiet look at what a small community was like in its coming to terms with the lightning-fast social changes of the 1970s. Jean Shepherd gave us the young boy's point of view of an earlier era in ""A Christmas Story."" The central character, the diminutive Anna Chlumsky, is not a stunning, pre-pubescent sex bomb, Gott sei dank. She's just an ordinary girl with big teeth who can act a bit. Dan Aykroyd gets through his role of the uptight mortician with his dignity intact. And Jamie Lee Curtis is yummy and self possessed, as always.",My Girl

6,grantss,"Sweet, emotional, unpretentious movie about love and loss",8,8 October 2016,"1972. Vada Sultenfuss (played by Anna Chlumsky) is an intelligent, bubbly, hypochondriacal 11-year old girl. Her father, Harry (Dan Aykroyd), is a mortician and a widower. Her best friend is Thomas J Sennett (Macaulay Culkin). Then her father hires a new receptionist, Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis) and life will never be the same again.Wonderful movie, and so much better than I expected. From the title and synopsis I thought it was going to be some sort of romantic drama made for teens/pre-teens. However, it is much much more than that. A great examination of love and loss, life, death and renewal and growing up. Very emotional, especially in the final few scenes.Anna Chlumsky is great as Vada. Most child characters end up being irritating, as they tend to be written for children and acted in bratty fashion. Vada's character is wonderful and Anna Chlumsky, in her second movie and first major role, gives a superb performance. Sadly, unlike her co-star Macaulay Culkin, her career never really took off after this and it took until the series Veep in 2012 before she got the sort of role she deserved.On that note, Macaulay Culkin's role is more subdued, has less screen time and less dialogue-intense than Chlumsky's. He does a solid job though.Dan Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis put in good performances too.",My Girl
7,Calicodreamin,Cute,7,7 August 2021,"A cute movie about life and death and life of a young girl. The cast have great chemistry and it's hard not to love Culkin and Chlumsky, they are so adorable. The storyline is unique and the ending is heartbreakingly good.",My Girl
8,view_and_review,I See Dead People,7,3 April 2020,"""My Girl"" is about a very complicated 11-year-old girl. I say that because I don't remember being eleven as being as complicated as it was for Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky).Anna was a slightly different eleven-year-old girl. Her mother died giving birth to her, her father runs a funeral parlor out of the house, and she is a hypochondriac. Other than that, her life is normal. One of the normalcies of her life is her best friend Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin). The two of them do all the things that normal kids in a small town in 1972 would do.The movie is a precious movie. I don't know if it over-complicated girlhood or not because I'm not a girl and never was. The essence of the movie was death: preparing for it, observing it, and getting past it. It's a morbid topic if you think about it, but ""My Girl"" toned down the morbidity of it by having a child star. ""My Girl"" is cute, sad, happy, and heartwarming and the dearest character Macaulay played in his formative years.",My Girl
9,FlashCallahan,I was born Jaundiced....,6,18 February 2014,"Vada is obsessed with death. Her mother is dead, and her father runs a funeral parlour. She is also in love with her English teacher, and joins a poetry class over the summer just to impress him. Thomas J., her best friend, is ""allergic to everything"", and sticks with Vada despite her hangups. When Vada's father hires Shelly, a makeup expert, in his funeral parlour, and begins to fall in love with her, Vada is outraged and does everything in her power to split them up.....I must have missed the boat with this one when it was first released, because seeing it for the first time 22 years after its initial release, it isn't really much of a movie.It's basically about an EMO type born way before it was cool to be EMO. Without Culkin, this wouldn't have had the prolific release or marketing it had back in 1992. The TV spots for this were literally on every 30 minutes and every bus stop had the one sheet.Which probably deterred me from seeing it for such a long time.The scene everyone talks about is very powerful, but it's handled badly, as if the film makers would know that lots of young girls would be seeing this.And because of the star power Culkin had at the time, the more interesting elements of the film, Ackroyd finding love after loss,Mis sidelined in favour of a first kiss.Its watchable fluff, but I would recommend checking your blood glucose every thirty minutes though.",My Girl
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,A timeless tale about your first love,6,30 December 2006,"I just finally watched My Girl last night, never saw it before, never really had the opportunity too, but my friend mentioned it while we were renting over at Hollywood Video and she said it was a really cute movie that could bring a few tears to my eyes, I wasn't in the mood for sad, but I have heard quite a bit about this film. I have to say that despite the fact that I wasn't blown away by the movie, it was a nice and honest film that you don't see in today's films, not to many are genuine like this.Vada is a little girl who basically surrounded by death in some aspects, her mother passed away and her father works in a funeral home. When a make up artist, Shelly, comes to work for her dad, Harry, Vada is a little threatened that her dad might be taken away from her. But she has another love, an English teacher who's class she starts taking just to impress him, but another little boy, Tommy, has a little crush on Vada, but as soon as she realizes what she has lost, maybe she should take a closer look at things.My Girl is a sweet and charming film that could make anyone feel very good and just makes you want to hug someone afterwards, as cheesy as it may sound. Even though I didn't cry, it does have some sad little moments, Macaulay shined in this movie, you could just tell this kid was star bound, wish someone would give him a break, because he is slowly climbing to top again. But he and Jamie were the stars of the film and really made it worth a watch.6/10",My Girl
11,DKosty123,Dark Dark Story Of Growing Up In The Worst of Tragedies,7,28 July 2009,"I thought I remembered the advertising for this movie as mainly about the music. When I recently saw this for the first time on AMC (with commercials) I was surprised. This movie takes a lot of time developing characters & a story. That doesn't happen often with films today as too many are focused on actions rather than story.Vada is a girl growing up with the most depressing of circumstances. Her mother died when she was born. Dad (Dan Achroyd in a rare straight role) rather than explain it too her, gives her the message that these things happen, deal with it. That is because he is a Funeral Director who is totally wrapped with death and has refused to deal with his wife's loss himself.Jamie Lee Curtis plays a women's make up artist who comes into their lives and tries to straighten everything out as she becomes dads girlfriend & the closest thing to a mother Vada has ever had. Jamie looks very shapely in this movie though I like her figure even when she actually wears jeans that are not real tight in one scene.Vada seems to have tragedy all around in her life as she has a grandma who is out of touch. She has a crush on her English teacher so she wants to become a writer. She has a boy as her best friend & together with her Uncle, she is trying desperately to sort things out.This film is well performed & really is quite touching. The only fault might be that Vada could show more emotion in some sequences though it does coming flowing out late in the film. This seems quite logical though given that her dad doesn't let his emotions flow until late in the movie either.",My Girl
12,ElMaruecan82,"If not flawless, a genuinely sensitive coming-of-age story...",7,5 June 2017,"It's been a quarter-century but I still remember the wide attention ""My Girl"" got at the time of its release. In French, the title was translated to ""Copain, Copine"", a derivation from classic French film ""Cousin, Cousine"" and whose translation is ""Boyfriend, Girlfriend"", the publicity focused on two elements: an unprecedented kiss between children (and I still remember when my friend showed me the picture on a magazine) and Macaulay Culkin playing the lucky boy. He was still emerging from his success in ""Home Alone"" that I wasn't the only one to think he was the star of the film, but I guess the original title wouldn't have mislead us.Still, with a quick glance at the poster, you can tell that the film tried to capitalize on the popularity of Culkin who was the rising star of the early 90's, passing the torch to Anna Chlumsky in her acting debut, he doesn't even wear his nerdy glasses and has a dashing smile that is in total contradiction with the shy and Milhouse-like personality he displayed all through the film, and it's a fine performance and so is Chlumsky as little Velda, a 11-year old girl at the threshold of her teen years and dealing with the 'things of her age' such as death and love, with a widowed Dad (Dan Aykroyd) managing a funeral parlor and falling in love with his newly hired employee (Jamie Lee Curtis), she sure will have one notion or two coming. The title could have well been ""My Girl's World"".Now, the reason I mentioned the whole marketing about the film is because it doesn't provide anything seminal in the coming-of-age department, even deaths of a beloved one was pretty well covered in ""Stand by Me"", the only moment the film makes you aware that this is told from a girl's perspective is when Velda, after a ""hemorrhage"" scare, has a talk with her Dad's fiancé about bees and flowers. The rest will inspire a few déjà-vu comments but what the film lacks in originality, is compensated by the good acting and a characterization that actually makes you care for these people, especially since the early 70's where the film takes place doesn't look much different from the early 90's when we saw it, or maybe kids didn't change much over this lapse of time.There are a few awkward moments that don't belong to the level of intelligence and sweetness infused in the earlier scenes, the dad's level of denial when it comes to Velda's antics are sometimes contrived and I'm not sure a kid losing his glasses would have let the bees sting him like that, and I mean it from my own experience, but but the film manages to emerge above these shortcoming, because of the central performances of Chlumsky and Culkin who's the perfect counterpart to her fiery personality. The situations with adults are also full of humanity and genuine humor, the complicity with the Dad, the benevolent teacher played by Griffin Dune and Jamie Lee Curtis who finds the right note between warm and funny.This is the kind of plot-less films that is more about things of your age, and it's a miracle that it managed to remain as captivating. You don't really see the sadness near the end coming, and I can't help but feel it was forced into to make such an impact the film would be reminded as a tear-jerker, it did a fine job for that, I fell for it too. That's how good it is, you know the intentions but you're ready to forgive them because a story needs to be good before being predictable.",My Girl
13,John6Daniels,"""Put on his glasses.""",10,10 November 2018,"In the early 00's as a young boy I woke up to this movie. They key moment that made me fall in love with this movie was when the boy dies and the girl sobs for him.Not sure how and why I found this movie but its a memorable random find.This movie is a very well made movie and this is coming from someone who watched this movie is a young boy and now in my late 20's.Its a nice, slow, impactful, educational and an entertaining calm movie to enjoy on a Sunday night.We get to see the Downs of a disturbed girl who lives with her father that shelters and neglects her emotions and development.With new events occurring in her life we see her trying to adjust to it.This is a good movie for college classes or people to analyze the effects of children dealing with death, body changes and being introduced to new people in their life.",My Girl
14,lisafordeay,A movie from my childhood,7,18 December 2015,I remember this movie since I was a kid. It was about a young girl who happened to be a tomboy who befriends a boy played by Macaulay Culkin from the Home Alone franchise and the pair are inseparable. Her mom passed away a long time ago and her father played by Dan Aykroyd is getting married again to Jamie Lee Curtis and of course we follow this girl as the film progresses. Bottom line I enjoyed this as a kid and I haven't seen it in years since I was a kid. I remember the song My Girl(hence the name of the film)and the part where Culkin's charcther dies after getting stung by bees and I remember crying when I seen that part and before that he gave the young girl a mood ring and he and her were fighting and that.My advice to you is to track it down on DVD and watch it. Its a touching movie from my childhood and I enjoyed it.,My Girl
15,jadavix,Sweetness and tragedy,8,15 September 2021,"Here's an effective coming of age story from the early '90s.I can remember my surprise at a certain tragic development in the plot, and that it would happen to a character played by a certain performer at that stage in their career.Re-watching it, I knew to expect that jarring funeral scene, and as such was able to enjoy it more as a coming-of-age story starring the adorable and talented Anna Chlumsky.I say check it out if you haven't. But it seems to be a movie everyone has seen.",My Girl
16,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,It really touched me and made me feel good,9,18 November 2005,"MY GIRL, in my opinion, is a very touching and funny comedy/drama/romance. I thought that Vada (Anna Chlumsky) was a little too obsessed with death, looked good with the make-up on, and she should have been nicer to Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis). When Harry (Dan Aykroyd) punched Shelly's ex-husband, Danny (Ray Buktenica), in the stomach when he showed up at his house to try to take her camper, I went, ""Wow!"" If you ask me, Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin) was a little too afraid of a lot of things. I thought Shelly looked beautiful in all the dressy stuff she had on, especially the dress she wore when she and Harry went out to Bingo. That reminds me of the part when Vada was outside with her friend and shouted the word, ""Bingo!"" I laughed really hard at that part. To me, Vada looked very beautiful in the dress she wore to the final writing class. In conclusion, this movie really touched me and made me feel good, and I highly recommend it if you're a fan of Dan Aykroyd, Anna Chlumsky, Macaulay Culkin, or Jamie Lee Curtis.",My Girl
17,Movie-ManDan,Wonderful. Touching. Funny. Powerful,8,4 February 2017,"My Girl is one of those timeless 90's movies that kids forever cherished. It has everything you could want all placed in the right spots. Although not a masterpiece, it comes pretty close.This film tells the defining times of a young lady's life. It is the summer of 1972, the girl is 11 and a half year old Vada Sultenfuss who is an emerging woman. her life is a little bit unorthodox. Her mother died a few days after giving birth to her, her father (Dan Aykroyd) is an undertaker, and her grandmother is in the final stages of Alzheimer's disease. Death is all round her. She is more of a tomboy, outcasted from regular girls. Her best friend is the low-immune Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin). She has the hots for her teacher (Griffin Dunne) and signs up for an adult poetry class just to see him. Meanwhile, her father starts dating his newest make-up artist (Jamie Lee Curtis). Vada has mixed bags with Curtis' character, liking a mother figure but wanting her father to herself. This is the general outline for this girl's summer.The subject of death and illness fascinates Vada. The escapades she goes on are all fun and nice. While the movie is mostly a drama, there are some very funny scenes. There's one where Vada and Thomas J kiss near a pond just to see what all the fuss is about. Then there's when they sneak off to interrupt her father at a Bingo party. Other than that, the movie will make you cry. Everybody knows the ending. *Spoiler* Thomas J is looking for Vada's mood ring when he moves a beehive and the bees go crazy. Many bees sting him which causes him to have a fatal allergic reaction. It is sad enough, but Vada confronting her friend's memorial is a surefire way to cause anybody to cry so hard. That's Vada.This was the debut of Veep star Anna Chlumsky. The whole movie hinges on her performance as Vada. The supporting cast is great too, but Chlumsky gives one of my favourite performances ever. Vada's character is so richly detailed that any girl could generated sympathy. But NOBODY could have played her at such a high calibre as Anna Chlumsky.This is a beautiful movie about emerging adulthood and how things change. Things, film wise, seem to go seamlessly to create a great film to capture your heart.3.5/4",My Girl
18,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Darth Vada,8,18 January 2015,"My Girl takes place at a small town funeral home in 1972, following the strange, adventurous and tragic summer of a little girl named Vada who acts like a Harold & Maude extra; she's obsessed with death and dying and is a hypochondriac as well, making her appear very strange to other kids in town. Her only friend is a nerdy but kind boy her age named Thomas J. who is ""allergic to everything"". Vada truly cares about him but has trouble expressing her friendship; often she pushes him around but for most of the summer the two are inseparable. Her father,meanwhile, hires a makeup artist for the bodies at the funeral home, Shelly, who Vada becomes close to until Shelly and Vada's dad start dating. A tragedy happened after Vada was born when her mom died after birthing her, so Vada naturally feels guilty about that. Her confusion about all that, plus a crush she's developed on a teacher, are driving her crazy, but on the bright side she still has Thomas J. for support as well as a pet goldfish from the local carnival... but when something horrible happens, Vada realizes for the first time how valuable friendship is and how life is a gift, and it makes her a more mature person.My Girl is nostalgic, funny, sad, hopeful and entertaining all at once, with great soundtrack and acting. Macaulay Culkin often plays outgoing, annoying roles (Home Alone, The Good Son), so it's amazing how he can go from the role of spoiled bratty kids to soft-spoken, shy Thomas J. just like that. Jamie Lee Curtis (from the 1980 Canadian horror film Prom Night), was really good as well. Vada's character was a little annoying at first but as the movie progresses she changes. Along with the soundtrack are also some popular 60's and 70's hits, including ""My Girl"" by The Temptations, where this movie got its name.This movie is incredibly sad and has a looming theme of death, but at the same time it's a wonderful story about growing up, the meaning of friendship, the meaning of life and the nostalgia of the 1970's. It's definitely worth checking out, but avoid the sequel because the sequel wasn't very good at all.",My Girl
19,DunnDeeDaGreat,Touching film that I still love,9,16 June 2003,"I recall seeing My Girl eleven years ago and fully understanding what was going on in the film. The chemistry between Culkin and Chumskly is good considering they are both kids. The film is funny and is heartbreaking because it was one of the first films to make me cry. I love this movie , but stay away from the sequel.",My Girl
20,gizmomogwai,"Morbid, but oddly sweet",7,7 November 2011,"I certainly remember this one as a kid, it was the movie where Macaulay Culkin dies- enough to shock any Home Alone fan. My Girl is, in fact, generally very concerned with death, as its main character Vada is an 11-year-old girl who has the misfortune of growing up in a funeral parlour. Unsurprisingly, she is not a normal little girl.The movie begins with Vada announcing she has cancer to her father, who ignores it. That's dark. She constantly thinks she's ill; she is obsessed with her own mortality. She portrays her grandmother as a zombie to scare some other kids. On the plus side, she loves reading and writing, much like I did. (I never read War and Peace, though.) When she joins a writing class, it's amusingly awkward when a woman reads a story inappropriate for an 11-year-old to hear. It's followed immediately by an immature ode to ice cream.I was surprised that this movie's IMDb rating is in the 6s, as people seem to love this movie. I don't think I fully understood it as a kid, but it is a sweet movie, with satisfying writing and performances.",My Girl
21,ODDBear,Charming and sweet,8,13 January 2006,"Vada Sultenfuss (Chlumsky) doesn't have an easy childhood. Growing up in a funeral parlor, she's literally obsessed with death, especially since her mother died giving birth to her. Her father, Harry (Aykroyd), is a very private man who doesn't get out much and doesn't get too involved in his daughter's life. Vada is a complete daydreamer, spending her days drooling over her writing teacher (Dunne) and playing with her best friend (Culkin). But her upcoming summer is going to be anything but uneventful.A really sweet little film, full of heartache and emotions. Chlumsky gives the most mature and convincing child performance I've ever seen, completely believable and very charming. Culkin is a delight also as her best friend, the guy should never have grown up. Aykroyd and Curtis do well in their small roles and supporting actors all contribute heavily.My Girl is a well written and charming movie, filled with irresistible 60's music and captures the flower era wonderfully. This film nearly makes me weep every time but not quite, maybe sometime in the future.",My Girl
22,fernandoschiavi,"""My Girl"" is a research of the childhood of relationships, and not just of childhood, or of relationships",8,7 February 2021,"In contrast to the smiles shown in the trailer and the children's production label, director Howard Zieff's film (1927-2009) leaves us with a ""chicken bone stuck in the throat,"" in the words of the lovely child protagonist. Laurice Elehwany's script is extremely happy as it constantly addresses the parallels between life and death from Vada's perspective. Amid funerals, the film shows Vada extremely confused by the idea of death. The narrative begins with Vada showing coffins from her father's work to friends and frightening them with her grandmother, who despite being alive, we can say that the undead behaves. The director shows us that Vada knows the terror and the value of death for people, despite not being aware of the reason. She also shows terror when entering the bodies' makeup room. I resort to a scene where Vada, when trying to get the ball in the body preparation room, despairs and tries to escape reality by closing her eyes and singing loudly. Like childhood practices, by blocking external perception, it closes in its parallel, but safe universe.The confusion between life, death and human relationships causes Vada to have symptoms of the bodies her father buries. For each illness or disease, Vada manifests or pretends to manifest in his own body all the symptoms of the illness that led to death. This is the case of prostate cancer, which Vada pretends to feel pain. But it is not just about the death experience that Vada is confused. She is confused with her own body in formation and menstruation, with her loving feelings and lack of paternal attention. Her father, because he lives in the workplace and, therefore, is always busy with the dead, does not seem to care what happens to family members, living people. There is a duality here between the living, her family, and the dead, her work. There is a moment where Shelly says ""life is not just death, Harry"". There is an argument in this scene of the film that we live towards death. To live is to walk to death. With this argument, Shelley draws Harry's attention because he seems to care more for the dead than for the living people, and especially his daughter, Vada. Wouldn't it be, therefore, the symptoms of the dead bodies that the father buries in Vada's body in an attempt to approach his father's affection? Vada seems to know, unconsciously, that being a dead body or dying can give immediate attention to the claim that the father is missing. This is the same reason that Vada always seeks the doctor to, with the authority of a professional, validate her desperate request in symptom.Vada's relationship is complicated by Thomas Jefferson, played by Macaulay Culkin. The character enters as an element that crosses all this confusion of Vada's life. He is Vada's best friend, the one who accompanies her to consultations and the protagonist's companion most of her time. There is a moment in a conversation between Thomas J and the medical secretary when she asks Thomas J. if he knows why Vada always comes to the office, he replies directly that she thinks she is dying. The secretary insists once again if he thinks the same, and he says no, but understands that Vada lives the terror of living in a funeral home. At one point, Thomas says, ""You can't go against them, join them."" Therefore, following Thomas' reasoning, Vada's symptoms are not just an attempt to get closer to her father, but a relief from the very terror that she experiences every day. What Vada knows about death is her relationship to her father's funeral practices. When imagining death as the dead body, Vada lacks the affectionate relationship with the living body. The dead body terrifies Vada, as it is a body without remembrance, without memory.There are symbolisms present in the film: poetry and nature. First we will talk about the poetry that enters as a cathartic element in the film. Vada is in love with the literature teacher and decides to take a poetry course in the middle of summer. Poetry is known as the aesthetic expression of human feelings. Vada, in the moment of pure confusion, is unable to offer anything but rhymes, as she does not access her deepest feelings. Poetry, like writing in rupture, the extrapolation of human anguish, is a communication tool for the viewer who longs for a painless Vada. She was relieved with so many mysteries and anxieties of life, for being an 11-year-old girl, and that she has just menstruated for the first time. Menstruation is the symbolism of nature present in the film female body. It is the mark of death carried by not fertilizing, but contradictorily the sign of life that a girl can finally breed. Another symbol of nature present is the weeping willow. In terms of photography and image, perhaps this is the main element present in the film. The relationship that Vada develops with Thomas J. is always photographed under a weeping willow. The first kiss, the blood pact, the escape of the killer bees. And it is about the weeping willow her final poem.The tree dialogues with the plot in question directly. Weeping willow symbolizes purity, but also immortality and resurrection. It is related to death, mourning and melancholy. The tree is the place where Vada seeks her memory of Thomas J., but also where she finds the representation of her own suffering. The weeping willow metaphor in Vada's final poem makes her find the relief of understanding her own pain in nature. It is the catharsis that the viewer expects as an outcome of the narrative. The knot that is finally untied. ""He thinks that death forever separated them"" states that Vada finally got the experience of death, the experience of mourning and affective memory, ""But in his heart he was forever"". The affection that was missing to complete his childhood death imagery. The understanding of death closes in like nature's time. There is always the promise of a spring after a severe winter. There is always a being born, a flowering. The weeping willow is thus the comfort that Vada finds in nature.There is a no less important relationship in the film between Vada and Shelley Devoto. Shelley is the new body makeup artist hired by Vada's father and his current girlfriend. Shelley is a dangerous supplement in Vada's life. Supplement in the sense that she transforms events and takes the place of the mother. Shelley reproduces the logic of the maternal lack that the protagonist feels about her mother's presence. We know during the film that her mother dies from complications of childbirth. In this way, we know that Vada also feels guilt and guilt makes her live with the idea of her mother's absence at home. Vada, however, had no opportunity to meet his mother and experience her death. Shelley is therefore the one who supplements is missing, the one who cares about Vada's behavior problems, the one who explains about the first menstruation and the difference in puberty between men and women. It is also Shelley who shares stories, but above all who supports and comforts Vada in the moment of mourning. Shelley is the representation that new cycles are possible among the living after a loss.We know in the film that Vada is divided by two loves: 1) the Platonic, by the literature professor 2) and the possible, by Thomas J. Vada is not only divided between two men, but between literature and philosophy. Despite being a professor of literature, Mr. Bixler represents Platonic love in Vada, therefore the philosophical portrait. Who represents his profound and literary feelings is Thomas J. He is the Weeping Willow, it is poetry, it is Vada's first love, it is memory, remembrance and the closed cycle. Only with the loss of Thomas J., someone for whom Vada had an affective literary memory for the narrative of love to end.""My Girl"" is that tickle that moves in meaning through the prism of friendship, without haste. It is a research of the childhood of relationships, and not just of childhood, or of relationships. In this film, friendship colors everything that is about to transform with a simple touch, a silent chain of feelings that just happens. But with the background wandering the film all the time, something there suggests that life is a daily being born and dies, disappointment is a type of death, just like that flower, which has just withered.",My Girl

24,Atreyu_II,"Decent movie, well done... not my cup of tea, however",7,17 March 2011,"Generally speaking, this is not a bad movie. It's good for a one-time viewing, feels worthy of the time and electricity wasted to watch it, but not one to bother to see again. It's not one of those that can be watched over and over with no problems and certainly one that isn't a classic and doesn't stand the test of time as well as many do. Although reasonable it ain't good enough to be part of a movie collection (at least not mine). I speak for myself, of course. Nobody has to agree with me.The lead character (Vada) is not very captivating. She is too strange and moody to be likable, even though she is understandable. To live in a residence that is a funeral parlor at same the time and have a father who is a funeral director like she does, no wonder she is so obsessed with death and a hypochondriac (that is, always with the mania of the diseases). She is also a tomboy and she has a crush on her teacher, Mr. Bixler. Another thing that leads to her obsession with death is this: she believes she was responsible for the premature death of her mother who died 2 days after her birth.I can see why so many people are enchanted by this film and why they consider it cute. True, it does have some cuteness, but its cute side is very far from overshadowing the darker side. There is plenty of strong content for a movie that is supposed to be for kids and that goes farther than just everything I said about Vada. For instance, like somebody mentioned in one of the reviews here, it has sudden change of moods. They don't overdo anything but the obsession with death and hypochondria are quite unpleasant subjects. Vada has an invalid grandmother with Alzheimer's disease. The profession of Vada's father and the fact that the house is a funeral parlor is off-putting as well. The movie also deals with Vada's first menstrual cycle, Vada's friend Thomas J. Sennett dies from an allergic reaction after being attacked by a group of bees and Vada gets to know that her teacher is gonna marry. All unpleasant stuff.On Vada's temperament, I think she is sometimes unfair towards Thomas, in particular when on a beautiful and sunny day he innocently invites her to go to swim with him and what does she do? She pushes him and tells him to go away and not to come back for five to seven days! As for the lousy first kiss scene, it may be cute for children to watch but probably not the most appropriate thing for mature people. It would be one thing if it was just a normal kiss on the cheeks, but what happens here is a kiss on the lips. In my book, that is not something for children to do, they're too young to do that. Children should act like children and not like older people.So far I've been talking about the negative side of the film. On the good side, it has a nice soundtrack (with lots of gold oldies), some good summer adventures combined with shiny scenario, a good acting by Anna Chlumsky, a great acting by Macaulay Culkin and also a good acting by Jamie Lee Curtis (who is quite attractive and hot on this film). The glasses don't fool anyone, Macaulay Culkin is instantly recognizable. And even with the glasses he looks so innocent and cute.In conclusion, an okay film, not a great film, just an okay film. However, I prefer to watch 'Radio Flyer' over this anyday.",My Girl

She was upset even more when she found out that her teacher was getting married to an older woman that's about his age (Same age) Vada read out a poem she wrote after the death of Thomas J infront of her class which she chose to join in the adult class because of the teacher she had a crush on. The Poem was a nice poem because i think as a character like that, you would read it on behalf as you would think about the one you have lost and loved.

31,cosmic_quest,Touching insight into the trials of growing up,8,16 April 2006,"'My Girl' is a rare treat in that it is a moving family drama that never descends into being overly-sentimental or cloying in the messages it's trying to deliver. It is a very bittersweet look at the joys and tears a girl faces when she stands on the cusp between childhood and adolescence.Set over the summer of 1972, the film centres on Vada Sultenfuss, a motherless eleven-year-old tom-boy who has enough problems coping with impending adulthood on top of having to contend with her oblivious mortician father Harry and her senile grandmother Gramoo. And if things were not bad enough, Harry hires an assistant in the form of the funky Shelly leaving Vada feeling her place in her father's life is threatens by this new woman. Thankfully she is not alone as seeing her through her troubles is her loyal best friend Thomas J.While Dan Anckroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis, as Harry and Shelley respectively, were great in their roles as two adults who both care for Vada and who have a growing attraction to each other, it was the child actors who stole the show. Anna Chlumsky, in this her film debut, delivered a first class performance as Vada, depicting the all the little nuances of the character from the confusion a tom-boy feels as she tentatively embraces her girly side in deference to her first crush to the desolation of bereavement to the loneliness she feels due to her father's thoughtless neglect. She was excellent in showing Vada's childish innocence and rare maturity that comes when a child has dealt with the harsh side to life.Macaulay Culkin was another surprise as he portrayed the guileless Thomas J. It was a pleasant change to see him in a role other than the obnoxious kid he usually depicted in previous films such as 'Home Alone' and 'Uncle Buck', and he rose to the occasion with flare, perfectly displaying the bumbling but sensitive and caring nature of his character. His performance here proves that, had he chosen to, he could have been one of the rare few who succeed in the seamless transition from being a child actor to a teen/young adult actor.'My Girl' is so involving for a wide age group because it not only conjures up nostalgic memories of summers gone by in adults who occasionally long for the carefree bliss of childhood but it engages younger viewers into considering the lessons of loyalty, love, loss and growing up. It definitely strikes a cord in those who are eleven years old themselves (I was eleven when I first saw this film and felt as if I could identify with Vada on many things). Most girls of eleven will probably empathise with Vada's views that nothing happens to boys! Highly recommended.",My Girl
32,A_Voice,A touching and innocent effort.,8,6 December 2013,"This was one of those innocent family drama which can leave you heavyhearted and with teary eyes. A light movie which explores the innocence of a child's mind and influence of the environment they live in on them.It is the story of little Vada, who is trying to cope up with hard reality of death in her life. Her mother is dead and she has a busy and gloomy undertaker for a father. So being neglected, she tries to gain attention and only has one friend.As the story progresses one falls in love with Vada and Thomas J. Both the characters are depicted beautifully and innocently by the new comer Anna and our favorite child actor, Macaulay. The film does tend to be a little boring at times but catches up in the last 30 minutes or so, but last 5 to 7 minutes still seemed to be a little stretched.Direction: Good.Script/Screenplay: The story is simple, but the screenplay is good.Acting: Fine performance by Anna, Macaulay and Lee Curtis.Music: Sweet and fitting.A light movie which can be enjoyed witch family or a loved one over a cup of coffee.",My Girl

36,emilie8605,had good acting from the children,6,17 December 2003,"my girl is summed up as the movie where the girl has a strange dad running a business in the house as a undertaker, where he is dating someone new. and the entire time anna focuses on the death of the mom, whose influence is no where to be found, as anna develops into a tomboy and befriends a kid who is almost allergic to everything around him. this movie had the average amount of funnies, and some drama. but i figured that she would be messed up since the dad is an undertaker in the house! enough said, i would be messed up for life.  but i guess she takes it as normal, since she practically grew up there. jamie lee curtis let off the halloween vibe to me, like she still brought that character with her and tries to portray the nice girlfriend. and dan shouldnt be a undertaker, if there is one change i could make about the movie would give him a different job, like a gardener or something.. so the atmosphere of death isnt all around him.  so overall, the movie was average acting, but the performances of the children was perfect, and so whenever i see the oldie on tbs, i tear up.

37,n-mo,Difficult to fault,10,5 June 2016,"""My Girl"" is a thorough yet unpretentious psychological coming-of-age tale, and Roger Ebert described it as a slightly-younger take of ""The Man in the Moon."" Certainly there are important similarities in the basic plot structure and overlap in the themes. However, such a comparison undermine somewhat the impact of the ""few crucial years younger"" that Ebert agrees the kids in this film are. ""The Man in the Moon"" tries to wander into more explicit and sophisticated philosophy and consequently is somewhat awkward at point; ""My Girl,"" however, remains true and respectful to the insular world in which protagonist Vada Sultenfuss finds herself: at the crossroads of the simplicity of childhood just becoming picked up in the first gusts of the whirlwinds of adolescence.Played perfectly by the too-elusive Anna Chlumsky, Vada is a sweet, adorable and highly intelligent but slightly ""off"" 11-year-old girl: she has a quirkiness that keeps her from quite ""clicking"" right with other girls her age, so not surprisingly her best friend is himself the slightly nerdy/misfit Thomas J. Sennett (Macauly Culkin, who is worlds away from ""Home Alone,"" here, and certainly worlds away from his future coke-headed self). We aren't left to wonder why: the daughter of a widowed and kindly but distant undertaker (Dan Aykroyd) who grew up in a funeral parlor and never knew her mother, she hasn't been taught to connect or to come out of her shell as she ought.Over the summer after fifth grade, however, a series of events begin to change this. One is the presence of Shelly DeVoto (Jamie Lee Curtis), a divorcée who takes a liking to Vada's father and slowly begins to draw him out from his guarded indifference. Shelly quickly takes a liking to Vada, as well, and inspires and encourages her to explore her nascent inner interests as well as offering a few badly-needed pointers from woman-to-woman. The mischievousness of Vada's interests and her reaction to the more mature world she's about to join are so well-written and executed I'm sure they must be documentaries of real children I knew at school!The second, more dramatically catalytic event, is a monumentally tragic climax, which of course set against the coming-of-age is what invited the comparisons with ""The Man in the Moon."" But because this film is so much more poignant and the children so innocent, the tragedy hits the audience much harder in this film than it did back then. It is perhaps for that reason that a number of people simply cannot bear to watch this one: they find it excruciatingly sad, and sad indeed it is, and it only gets harder for me to watch the older I get. Still, it was important, and indeed necessary. All her life Vada had protected herself - since no one else did so - by blocking her actual soul off from something she knew so well intellectually and by which she was physically surrounded. Now suddenly she comes face-to-face with it in her own life, and she can no longer hide from herself.The setting in early 1970s small-town Pennsylvania was perfect for drawing out the innocence of an America that seems further gone with every passing year, providing a backdrop for an innocent childhood that seems less probable with every passing year. I'm not so optimistic this new America will find its footing so well as Vada eventually did, but the conclusion here is believable enough that, by analogy, we may yet hold out some hope.",My Girl

39,shneur,This is not great cinema (duh...),5,24 March 2005,"There's a lot wrong with this film. Start with two purportedly intelligent 11-year-olds who have all the savvy of 7-year-olds who've been locked in an attic. Add in that Macauley Culkin can't act and comes across as a trained sea lion, though some might say prettier (itself debatable). Proceed to that annoying voice-over. I thought a voice-over, when necessary at all, serves to superimpose upon the action the retrospective, and ostensibly more enlightened, reflections of the narrator at a later time. Otherwise, as here, it indicates only that the writers couldn't manage action and dialogue sufficiently to tell the story. I won't mention the melodramatic plot because 1) it might not yet be cliché to very young viewers, and 2) I don't want to be accused of ""spoiling,"" though I can't imagine anyone reading this who doesn't already know what happens. Therefore I'll end with the question-cum-protest of why poor Anna Chlumsky, whose performance is the one delight in this movie, gets billed FOURTH?

This exact same thing happened to me when I was young, except I as the survivor, I was the boy instead of the girl.I don't mean to discourage others from seeing it. It's just too painful for me to have to endure it again. The acting was superb, in fact so surperb, that it had me left with tears that I didn't know I had left to cry. It's a good movie, and I hope everyone who sees it understands its meaning. It amounts to a lot more than a young girl who looses her best friend through a freak accident.Thanks for letting me express my opinion.",My Girl

Anna Chlumsky was a real find considering what little acting she had done before this. In my opinion Macaulay Culkin looked totally out of his element doing a drama at that age. While Chlumsky was embodying her character in mesmerizing fashion, Culkin looked like someone off stage gave him his line reading and he walked out and said it like a kid in a school play. Dan Aykroyd seems miscast in a mediocre performance. Jamie Lee Curtis does a fine job but there is zero chemistry between her and Aykroyd. The plot seemed to meander.

Overall this is a movie worth watching.",My Girl
56,pieschel,A touching story!,7,9 July 2000,"Vada is a messed up girl who constantly thinks she is dying and goes to the dodctor almost daily for a check-up because she thinks she has cancer or she claims she has a chicken bone down her throat. This is mostly because her dad is an undertaker and it scares her to have dead people in her basement. But let's get to the facts. Anna Chlumsky who plays Vada, is a great actress and most young actresses probably couldn't do the character Vada as well as she did. Now Dan Aykroyd, whoa. This definitely is not a good movie for him. He sounds like a robot and when he was giving emotional news to Vada as a father, he sounded like he was reading her ice cream poem like she was earlier in the film at a writing school taught by her sweet-heart teacher. Its hard to say if you'll like this movie about a death-obsessed girl who later gets troubled by her father being engaged to Shelly (Jamie Lee Curtis). The ending isn't exactly as sad as its cracked up to be but you'll still be satisfied. Another great performance comes from Macaulay Culkin, who plays Thomas J, Vada's best friend. He did a much better job in this movie than in all the Home Alone movies. If you're looking for an old movie to rent that won't be trash, My Girl is the movie for you!",My Girl

59,critical-escapist,What are family films missing these days?

But My Girl isn't like that.Am I the only one who just loves family films from the 1990s that are just like this? My Girl is a really enjoyable film, one of the best coming-of-age films that I've ever seen. The film doesn't bore you with all the clichés - it kind of make them more interesting. Vada is sort of a loner, her father works at a funeral parlor and gets a girlfriend who does the ""dead people's makeup"" and she tries to break them up with her best friend Thomas J. Pretty clichéd, in a way. But I loved the relationship between Vada and Thomas J. I really loved it. I don't know. It wasn't pathetic or forced, it was natural and I just liked that. If you just listen to them talk, they sort of talk like the way you want to talk, and the snippets of their conversations sound great.This film has grade-A writing. I loved the sound of it. They don't talk about ridiculous things, they talk about things that actually mean something little by little. It's a wonder to watch.The performances are great. Anna Chlumsky who plays Vada is just pure wonder. This is also Macaulay Culkin's best performance to date - better than both Home Alones combined. Dan Ackroyd is very believable in this, and he just takes the fatherly role, which I don't think is that hard to play. There is Jamie Lee Curtis in a small supporting role, but she's pretty good as well. The good thing about this casting is that all the actors fit their characters. The casting is just perfect.This is my favorite childhood film. It's sort of a memory, and I would like to watch it again. Even though it is not what I have experienced, I watch it and I think, ""Hm. It would be cool if I experienced that.""",My Girl

65,Thomas_Veil,You only THINK you won't like this movie,10,31 July 2006,"Many other people have summarized the plot of ""My Girl"", so let me just make a few observations:  You may, as I did, assume that this is going to be a chick flick or one of those safe, crashingly boring ""family"" pictures. In reality, it's neither. Though it's a family picture, the characters are so wonderfully realized, and the situations so easy to identify with, that if you give this movie five minutes, you WILL be sucked into watching it. AND you will enjoy it immensely. Anna Chlumsky -- I cannot say enough about her performance. And she was 11 years old? She may be an adult by now, but even as a kid, she had talent out the wazoo. Great actress. Why she didn't have a prolific career in Hollywood is anyone's guess. Guys -- you WILL cry. And there will be several points where you can't help getting misty-eyed. Again, it has to do with the wonderful writing and the sweet performance by Miss Chlumsky. The script is wonderful. I kept waiting to see some phony/clichéd ""Hollywood"" moment, but all the scenes were touching and real: Vada and Thomas J. learning how to kiss; Vada first liking Shelly, then feeling threatened as her dad falls in love with Shelly; Shelly sitting Vada down and explaining the birds and the bees to her (and Vada saying, ""That should be illegal."") There are laughs, there are tears, and there are the cute moments everyone enjoys in watching children grow up and people fall in love.",My Girl
66,zachsaltz,A wonderful and truly moving experience,10,9 July 2004,"""My Girl"" is one of those small treasures that, on outward appearance, seems like something it is not.  Any general synopsis of the film would lead most people (including myself) to excuse the film as a dine-a-dozen coming-of-age drama with first kisses, raging hormones, and middle school bullies.	The truth is, ""My Girl"" has all of those elements (except for the latter; the film takes place during summertime).  It isn't the most original story, and it doesn't try to be a masterpiece.  Its goal is to entertain the younger viewer and to remind the older viewer of the nostalgic days of innocence and the heartbreaking first encounters with the loss of it.	Summer, 1972.  Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is a plucky 11-year-old who spends her summer days with her best pal, Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin, who is far better here than anything else he's ever done).  She dotes on her father, Harry (Dan Aykroid), who works as an in-house mortician. Subsequently, the Sultenfuss house (a grand old Victorian, naturally) is filled with the stench of death, made only worse by Vada's grandmother (Ann Nelson) whose only way of communicating is through her sporadic breaks into popular songs from the 1940s.  It's only natural that Vada is also a hypochondriac who often believes she is dying.	This is, of course, the summer that Vada grows up.  Signs of change first begin when a new woman shows up.  Her name is Shelly De Voto (Jamie Lee Curtis), and she works as a makeup artist for the dead bodies.  At first she is discouraged by the fact that her clientele are deceased, but when sees that Harry and Vada need an outlet, she gladly takes the job (`They're dead. All they have are their looks,' she cheerfully gleams.)  Vada likes Shelly, but when she sees that Harry has developed a crush on her, she feels threatened.  She does not want Shelley to take the place of her late mother, who died two days after Vada was born.  Her only outlet is Thomas J., with whom she rides her bike to the lake and discusses all of the Big Issues (the meaning of life, love, death, which 70s TV family they'd live with.) 
	The other momentous event of the summer is Vada developing her first crush. It isn't Thomas J. (who idolizes her), but her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne).  He teaches a summer writing class at the local college, and Vada enrolls.  Besides being the youngest in the class, she is also the only one who hasn't been taken over by 1970s psychedelia (one day, the class takes part in a group meditation.)  	The strength of ""My Girl"" isn't its story, but its little nuances of innocent bliss.  Vada willingly shows a group of glowing boys a dead body. As the ride their bikes, Vada and Thomas J. sing `The Name Game'.  When writing poems `from the soul', Vada writes an ode to ice cream.  The relationship between Harry and Shelly is sweet, too.  Before their first date, Harry's womanizing brother points out that since Harry's last date, a sexual revolution has occurred.  Of course, Shelly only desires a proper and old-fashioned gentleman, which very much complicates their first date.
	Well, I loved this film.  As a viewer, I try to watch for inconsistencies in the performances and the script, but this film had none.  Dan Aykroid and Jamie Lee Curtis bring a low-key charm to their roles.  Both have their flaws, and it sometimes seems they have nothing in common.  But for some inexplicable reason, they are brought together and their encounters are tactful, witty, and very real.	As for Anna Chlumsky, it can only be said that this young actress sets the standard for all child performances.  This is not a performance, in a traditional manner;  she eludes all cutesy standards of the traditional child performance, and becomes a complex, multi-dimensional person with true needs.  This little girl is extremely intelligent, and when Chlumsky delivers lines beyond her years, she doesn't do it with sarcasm or adorability, but with the oblivious nature that 11-year-olds find themselves in.  The world may be changing around her, but she tries her hardest to maintain her sanity and cheerfulness.	Though ""My Girl"" is advertised as a kid's film, and kids would probably like it, this film is for adults.  It isn't always a happy film, and there is a major tragedy toward the end of the film.  But rather than sentimentalize, the tragedy serves as a bridge for young Vada in between the realms of innocence and childhood and the real world of loss and sadness. And as dark as ""My Girl"" may sometimes be, there is always a sense of charm and warmth brought to the screen by the characters.  This is a wonderful, wonderful film.",My Girl

72,That_Beatles_Girl,an absolutely beautiful movie,10,18 November 2006,"I don't know why some people gave this movie a low rating because it is a sweet and touching piece of cinema.The main story concerns Vada Sultunfuss,(Anna Chlumsky) a young girl who lives in a morgue with her father who works as an undertaker. Her only friend is the slightly wimpy, but still sweet Thomas J. (Macauly Culkin in one of his better roles). She is secretly in love with her English teacher. Meanwhile, her father (Dan Aykroyd) starts up a romance with his pretty assistant (Jamie Lee Curtis), which shakes things up quite a bit for Vada.While struggling to deal with hormones, a change in the family dynamics, and facing the truth about her mother's death, Vada grows up in the summer of 1972. Great songs and instrumental pieces are strewn throughout the movie.After reading all of this, you might think that ""My Girl"" is a typical coming-of-age film, but nothing could be further from the truth. This film boasts great acting from the entire cast, hilarious scenes (gotta love that bumper car scene at the Carnival) and possibly one of the most heart-wrenching moments in modern film.I watched ""My Girl"" as a child, but I think it is a better film for older teenagers and adults, who remember what it's like to be that age. If you have ever experienced the death of a friend or sibling you are likely to weep during this movie. Or even if you have not.""My Girl"" is a great family film, and a great film overall.

In compensating the schmaltzy, heart-breaking moments with funny, lightweight comedy scenes and being as credible as possible, director Howard Zieff's pleasant direction relies heavily on the excellent cast of sympathetic performers with newcomer Chlumsky particular standout in the strong lead role, Culkin in probably his career best as a glasses-wearing wimp and some hilarious moments with weird grandma Nelson, and satisfyingly results in surprisingly even, charming, predictable, but universally watchable entertainment.",My Girl

Similar bond is depicted in the movie between Vada and Thomas J. The background music, cinematography and acting done by even the kids make this movie a great family movie.

Or read the book version of ""My Girl"", which was a worthwhile read.Why did I dislike this film so much?It was predictable.  Too much time went into warning parents that My Girl had a sad ending, at the expense of a darned good surprise.The performances, frankly, stunk; except for a few choice moments by Veda's uncle.  The dialogue was immature.  The plot was choppy and tended to focus more on what a horrific brat the main character was, rather than the friendship between Veda and Thomas J.I read the original script.  The film was SUPPOSED to end with the line ""My mother will take care of him!"" screamed from a distance; when Thomas J's mother returns Veda's ring.  It was a heartbreaking, emotional way to end a movie, and might have saved it; but someone chose to end My Girl with Veda and her ""new best friend"" getting on their two-wheelers and riding away. This, I presume, was meant to reassure all those little kiddies out there watching the film that Veda was ""gonna be OK"".  How insulting.  Those of us who have lost childhood sweethearts know better.  We never see Veda mourn.Other complaints:  The filmmakers try too hard to make us see Veda's dad as a ""nice guy"", even though in the original script, he was portrayed as a cold, heartless man who ruined Veda's childhood, which would have been much more believable.  Shelly was supposed to be about 20 years younger than she was portrayed in the film.The filmmakers also switch rapidly back and forth between how ""adult"" the children are, and how ""childish"" the children are.  Some films do this artfully and realistically (see ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"" for a good example); however, with Thomas J and Veda, it felt like an utter lack of decisiveness:  ""Should we cater to the kids who will watch because of Culkin or should we cater to the adults who will watch because of Curtis?  Oh, well, let's try and cater to both.""This film could have been all kinds of things: thought-provoking, heartbreaking, funny, nostalgic . . .

84,turok818,My girl so sad....,10,30 June 2010,this movies is a very sad movie....i mean its like a movie you would watch by Nickolas sparks...but this is better instead as grown ups like all of his movies its about 2 kids...i mean 2 kids that don't really know what love is but they are close friends...the acting is top of the line and towards the end it becomes so very sad....i don't understand how it only has a six right now. it deserves a 10 it even has Jamie lee Curtis. anyways its better than a Nickolas spark movie and more cute to...its something everyone can relate to and when the sad part happens its so easy to put yourself in their shoes and experience the sadness. amazing movie i recommend to anyone,My Girl

86,tv_holic92,Beautiful and Touching,9,6 August 2013,"Saw my girl the other night.In one word: beautiful.What an amazing storyline.Just beautiful.Everyones acting was great.I definitely have to mention Anna Clumsky,who plays Vada .What an awesome character she plays.She is capable of anything from comedy to drama.I miss this kind of family movies of the 90s.Camera work was decent as well.Such an emotional and funny movie. I had good expectations from this movie despite its IMDb rating.have to say it managed to meet my high expectation.Though I knew the major spoiler involving Culkin's character (due to popular pop culture references on movies/TV shows) but still enjoyed every bit of it.I am giving it a 9/10.",My Girl

If you like Hallmark kind of movies, you may like this movie...It is not too sacharine sweet.The title song 'My Girl' is wonderful. I loved the scenes between the two kids.There is a scene where show pushes Macauly Culkin and tells him not to come back for the next 5-7 days. that was a great scene. :)Another scene was this whole sequence as to hwo she copes after the death of Macauly Culkin. There was a sequel made which was not all that great.",My Girl
88,nethaven,Quality as a plot and a score,10,27 February 2006,"Something about this movie sucks you in. Even if you take away the guts, it has its own little world. I believe this might be so more for me, since I didn't live through the time it takes place, but I found the atmosphere one that almost makes you forget about the ""adult world,"" which is charming.The story is also very well done. This movie is typically revered as one more enjoyed by children, but I think adults can get something out of it too, from the psychological depth of the characters. The plot also is not very cliché at all...so little that it stands out, and is inimitable enough that no one has even tried to rip it off.The acting is also pristine. Lastly, what tops off this movie is the music. As important as the movie itself is, even a good movie can be dulled out a little if the music isn't good. James Newton Howard outdoes himself here. The 70s tunes complete the effect of forgetting you're in a relatively punked out society where you won't find as many friendly streets. Also, several spots, such as Vada walking on the tree branches late in the movie, the music composed is an example of talent that few composers have to so fluently use music as a translation of emotions.The story is good, and the execution, which is equally important (and often neglected in would-be awesome movies), is next to flawless. It is not by any means mind-blowing, but it is not meant to be, and you will remember it.",My Girl

But if you just want to enjoy a light hearted comedy with a great cast then this is the definitely the movie to see;  No big words or technical jargon that make you scratch your head wondering what their saying; no puzzling over what they're getting at or any underlying message.

92,monsoon_11,A touching family film,10,15 December 2008,"My Girl tells the story of a precious girl named Vada Sultenfuss living in a funeral house with a neglectful father. Luckily, Thomas J., Vada's only friend, listens to her and they have summer adventures. But soon, things start to fall apart, her long time crush, Mr Bixler is engaged, Her father begins dating Shelly and tragically, Thomas J. passes away. But she manages to deal with her issues and mends her previous ones.This movie is beautiful on so many levels, themes of loss, self discovery and growing up. Anna Chlumsky is adorable and speaks confidently and maturely, she is just precious. Macaulay Culkin gives his best performance and you may need a box of Cleanex tissues. Dan Aykroyd gives a remarkable performance as a father that ignores his daughter.Over all, this movie was very enjoyable and touched me and hopefully it will touch anyone who watches it.10/10",My Girl
93,ariannastarr,A Film about what it is to grow up,10,28 April 2004,"Summer in the early 70's.  Vada Saltenfuss is 12 years old, dealing with a absent mother who died in childbirth, budding hormones beelining her at her poetry teacher, a live-in grandmother who's slipped into senility, and a distant undertaker father, whom Vada believes will only pay attention to her if she's dying, a feat she tries to accomplish on a weekly basis.  She has one friend that she feels comfortable with, her ""allergic to everything"" slightly gawky Thomas J.  This movie is about all of the things that change as we grow up, centered largely about dealing with the death of a loved one, how to grieve, how to cope, and how to move on.  In the beginning of this movie, neither Vada nor her father are connecting with each other.  He coops himself up in his funeral home house, surrounded with death, but never dealing with the death of his wife.  Vada believes that she killed her mother, and that thought haunts her, but she never talks about it to her dad.  Enter Jamie Lee Curtis' character, a make up artist who takes a position at the funeral home, and Vada's world, and her father's begin to change.  Vada has a female role model, and her dad has someone to shake him out of the funk he's been in for the last 12 years.  **spoilers**The plot is brought to a head when Thomas J is stung by bees and is killed. Vada's father thinks that seeing death and being able to deal with it are the same thing.  Vada proves otherwise.  Her grief on losing her first crush, her poetry teacher she just found out is engaged, her guilt on killing her mother and the unreality of Thomas J's death hit her hard at his funeral where she burst out in a heart wrenching monologue about her best friend.  I was 12 myself in 1991 when this movie came out and it never failed to bring tears, and laughter.  It is wonderful nostalgia of the simpler days of childhood and the sometimes heartwrenching process of growing up.",My Girl
94,Flicker-21,What planet are these kids from?,3,10 September 2001,"When Roger Ebert gave this film 3.5 stars, I naturally figured it must have something worth my time, especially as it boasted Jamie Lee Curtis in one of the leading roles. Imagine my surprise to discover a slow, unimaginative plot and wooden performances all around! Not only that, these kids are from Mars or possibly further out. It's as though they actually grew up on one of the TV shows they aspire to living in. This might rate 3.5 stars if you're 9 years old, maybe. For those more mature or discerning, time would be better spent watching something like ""Angelo, My Love"", directed by Robert Duvall. Now there's a kid with his feet on the ground!",My Girl
95,alains_postbus,I would recommend it to almost everybody,10,14 April 2000,"I saw this movie and my opinion is similar to Alexanders opinion: an excellent family movie. One of the thing that made the film so good was the acting of young actress Anna Chlumsky. I would recommend this movie to almost everybody with kids and teens, but it wouldn't hurt if adults would watch too.",My Girl
96,KatoCollins,"So many years later, still a favorite",9,5 September 2007,"Don't READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE WHOLE THING I first saw this movie when it first came out on video. I was six years old I think and this was a favorite of my sister. So we watched this over and over. Never getting sick of it. Recently, my sister and I were talking and I told her how I was flipping through the channels and saw it was on. She told me she was watching it too. Watching it like she was a child again. We both actually looked away when Veda goes to Thomas' casket so we don't get wrecked with emotion again.After all these years, the acting is still awesome, especially Anna Clumpsky and the almost always wonderful Jamie Lee Curtis. The stories are still reminisent of childhood and all the trials and tribulations that come with it. That the emotions a person felt then is still there.From the first moments to the end. This movie is sweet and sensitive. But in the true way, not sacarine sweet sickening way. And if there was one critique I was to give the movie was that they made a sequel that made the original seem not as good as it is",My Girl
97,andyroo54,Spans a half a lifetime and does it with expert skill,9,9 July 2016,"I just watched this movie again for the first time in probably twenty years. This movie really had a pretty big impact on my childhood, and it's funny because I can't really remember where I saw it, but I know it probably wasn't more than once, it might have been at the movies...but it might have been once or twice on VHS. A big part of the mystique of this movie is that it was released in the early 90's, but seemingly set in the 70's, and it's done so well you wouldn't even notice. I had the biggest crush on the girl at the time (Chlumsky), and I totally identified with the kid (Culkin), especially because I had a very close brush with death and almost died after having an anaphylactic reaction to a bee sting a year or two before. So this movie really spoke to me as a kid. I really felt like I was the kid in the movie.. which was a weird feeling. Watching it now twenty years later and it's quite a different perspective that you get. I identify much more with Aykroyd and Curtis. I suppose that's only natural. But the issues the movie deals with are timeless, and it does it with a respectability and competence that you don't see very often. The last twenty minutes of this movie will have crying pretty much constantly. It's a beautiful movie, and it's very rare that a movie can elicit such emotions across such a time span.",My Girl
98,lordsubro,Good Movie to relax,7,2 September 2016,"It is a nice movie to watch when you wanna relax. The romance between two kids is shown in a kids' way. Showing the summer time and the ordinary things in kids' life, movie is not making u tensed. Even though it is not the kind of movie which builds up suspense and makes you curious about the ending, is very successfully captures the attention from beginning. You don't need to be patient to watch this movie. Veda is a little girl growing up in a funeral home who is pretty normal kid but growing up in funeral home and knowing her dad is working on dead bodies in their basements, has some effects on her. on the other hand, Thomas J. is very simple fragile kid who is allergic to everything and follows his routine all the time. The movie might sound common and boring but it has a twist on it. Worth watching",My Girl
99,cabanaboi26,My Girl comment,8,17 October 2006,"I still remember seeing this movie for the first time back in 1990 or 1991. I thought when Vada goes up in the tree after T.J.'s death, she attempted suicide--this is my impression after you notice the cop coming up to the house in the next scene. Falling in love with your boss (especially since he's an undertaker) is tacky, I think. But at the same time, no other movie depicts such a relationship closer then what Harry and Shelly did in this movie. The relationship between them is better understood in the next movie, not because they are married, but the whole idea of it seems more natural, but for them to come together at first, it just seemed ""unnatural"". Maybe because of the undertaking deal, who knows! I enjoyed this movie over and over again like it was a movie I never seen before.",My Girl

I don't know where she got the ability. She must have some Barrymore blood.When Vada walks up to the coffin of her friend, and says ""Wanny go tree climen,? Where are your glasses? It enough to bring tears to the eyes of a stone. The parents of the boy are superb, as are Dan Adroud, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The film is very will cast, directed, and acted. The story will stay with you forever. Don't miss this one, and give it all your attention. It will carry you away. This fine film has made it to my top ten list. I wish every producer, director, screenwriter, actor and actress could see this story uninterrupted. My Top ten list includes, Gone with the Wind, Dial M for Murdewr, North by Northwest, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Ben Hur.",My Girl
103,lemke_rita,"First love, and first loss; there is something more to a movie than a happy ending",10,25 March 2007,"I was really young when I first saw this movie, and what takes me back all those years was the one scene at the end - Vada receiving the mood ring and seeing its changed colour. I don't want to delve too deeply into symbolic meanings, because at the age of 4, I never really dwelt on such things. But the sense of finality, as she moves on in her growth, is so true, and so bitter-sweet and tangible.'My Girl' gives life to any girl who has found themselves in-between, whether it be in terms of schoolyard 'fitting in' or just emotional maturity and understanding the depth of things that fall in place around you. For Vada, she was in a limbo between life and death, and by feeling death hit so close; she herself could grow and live more freely.Its so hard to explain the full impact of this film simply because the protagonist is a pre-teen who does not rely on words alone to explain her actions and personality quirks. Her best friend is a boy that makes my heart melt with a happy warmth, making the cold stab of loss so much harder to accept when the time comes for him to go.I used to dream as a little girl, fantasize how things would have been if Thomas had never died. I never got far, as Vada never seemed to be a complete character, and Thomas was far too quiet to hold her attention.She loved, lost and grew. I can say that its an ending that puts the rest of 'happily ever after' movies to shame; where a kiss and a spoken promise is enough to tide over the pain of some previous problem. To me, 'My Girl' is a skinned knee, a goofy smile and the shedding of tears. Its realising you are part of something bigger, and that your happy ending is overshadowed by a future more bright and amazing than you could ever imagine.",My Girl
104,demid,Excellent Family Entertainment,8,29 December 1998,"God knows, good family entertainment is hard to come by. In my considered opinion, My Girl is an outstanding exception from this rule. I have not read the book the film is based on. I would not be surprised, if it turned out to be much more superior to the film version; I, for one, find it unfortunately too often a case. However, judged on its own merits, the movie scores as high a rating as 8 in my book--in terms of achieving its purpose: pleasing the whole spectrum of possible viewers. The story-line is nicely balanced, with just the right mixture of the human situation drama, realism, insight into child psychology and optimism. One might argue that in the film finale Veda is shown as having too quickly recovered from her supposedly terrible and tragic loss, but children are indeed this way, and the depth of her earlier suffering is sure evidence that this chapter of her life will be forever locked into her conscience. It is exactly the balance I want my daughter exposed to. The dialog is fine: mature enough to show Veda's precociousness without overdoing it and to give the parents some intellectual pleasure and simple enough, on the other hand, for children to follow without losing themselves in its complexities. I regard myself as a poor judge of acting, but having said that, I find the acting in My Girl totally satisfying. If I may venture a guess, I'd say that, e.g., Jack Nickelson at his best would be to a large extent lost on the younger audience and would not be missed by adults who expected just to have great time with their kids together. That my wife and I have had.",My Girl
105,rajnsar,A very wonderful movie,10,4 December 2006,"The whole movie is in the perspective of a 11-year-old motherless girl going through a gamut of emotions mainly having to deal with death. However there is nothing morbid about the movie and in fact makes the movie more realistic - more wonderful, as death is viewed in the eyes of a girl just getting to know the world, literally. Going through guilt of death that she thinks she is the cause for, she has to endure the pain of going through it again, but this time consciously by the death of her best and only friend.The movie revolves around building up to that moment when death happens. The relationships are built, shown but never over pronounced. Each relation has a importance attached to it - the girl looking after the grandmother instead of the other way around, her father thinking that she will some day snap out of the abnormal behavior she seems to displaying off late, her doctor who understands what she is going through and ready to check her false symptoms always, her having to deal with the concept of step mother, her school teacher crush and finally a boy whose only good friend is she. As the film progresses, the varying dynamics between the relation of the character with the girl are shown, flowering wonderfully at each moment.And eventually when death happens, the burst of emotions the girl exhibits from anger to guilt to revealing the hidden feelings(like crushes) all make ""My Girl"" a wonderful movie to watch. Yes, there is sentiment which might be a little over tad to someone but frankly, what appeals to me the most about the movie is how that sentiment is handled.",My Girl
106,genie_rox7,Wow =-],10,3 January 2010,"This movie is magnificent! My Girl is set in the 1970's, mainly focusing on an 11 year old girl named Vada and her best friend Thomas J trying to work out the world around them. The young actors were so unbelievably good, especially Anna Chumsly who played the main girl herself, Vada Sultenfuss. The original is a lot better than the sequel, but when is this ever not the case?My FAVOURITE quote from this movie, and possibly any movie I've ever seen is when Vada first gets her period in her house, and Thomas J asks if she can come out to play. This is vague though, I am doing this from my memory of the script:*Vada answers the door* Thomas J: Hi Vada. Can you come out to play?Vada: Mm.. I don't know if my dad will let me... (about to close door)Thomas J: I was thinking maybe we could go swimming or something? Vada: GET OUTTA HERE! (pushes Thomas J) And don't come back for 5 to 7 days!!!My Girl is the perfect mix of everything a movie needs. It is very real to life, and is a touching and heart-warming story. You will be laughing your head off, and possibly bawling your eyes out, and will need a check-up at Dr. Welty's (viewers joke) to stitch them back up.Unbelievable. 10 stars.",My Girl

Forget all high tech special effects etc etc films - this one has it spot on. It makes me cry and that's a very difficult thing to do! I first watched this when I was about 9/10 (now 16) at my great-grandmother's house. She has this huge collection of videos and I loved the look of this one because the cover is so... normal but enjoyable looking if you see what I mean. Anyway, we watched it, and my sister thought it was ludicrous, and in a way I suppose it has it's ridiculous moments, but even so it's so sad, and touching, and deep, but also funny at times. I bought it for £1 a few weeks ago and just watched it again. It is just incredibly fantastic with amazing acting from all.About 18 months ago I was in some out of the way old video/record shop on holiday in Bristol. I was a My Girl 2 video and was desperate to buy it, but my mum and dad said it was ridiculous and wouldn't let me.

This movie was made before I was born, and I think that I first watched it when I was 7-10 years old... I can't really remember. But, this movie was amazing. I found it weird that Vada and Thomas J, as well as their peers, were ""innocent"". That's probably not the right word to use, but what I mean is that now (in the modern 2000s) sixth graders are more mature than Vada and Thomas J. For instance, modern day sixth graders wouldn't play those kind of games or have their first kiss and then say the pledge of allegiance. But that was one of the main things that I do like about it: their innocence. This movie made me cry at the end when Thomas J died. I've only cried during one other movie (the Notebook), and I definitely don't cry a lot. So, this was definitely a tear jerker, but I loved it. Watching it now still makes me cry because I couldn't imagine losing a friend and having to live without them and knowing that they died doing something for me.

I think they should have done it better though, like a proper kiss and longer. I may watch the whole film sometime. It does teach you a lesson about having friends and what to do if you have gone through that process. Macaulay Culkin has longer hair in the film and looks completely different, though his performance was fantastic. Anna Chlumsky's performance was also great, and believable.

Losing a good friend hurts so much, not to mention to a 11-year-old girl. It's a good movie and a warm one. If you have been through it, you definitely need to see it. It is about friendship mostly and it's not only for kids, but for adults who hardly feel a thing nowadays, not until they lost something they care for so much, maybe part of their life.",My Girl

Beyond that, the sweet and simple storyline, the adorable characters, and the heart-breaking moments all reached out to me, even at such a young age (just as The Land Before Time did)... If I had kids of my own, it would definitely be a movie I'd want them to see. I don't only recommend to it to children, though - adults who can appreciate movies that portray life's simplicities will definitely enjoy My GIrl. If you're easily driven to tears by movies, I suggest you take a box of Kleenex with you when you watch this...",My Girl
124,amanda793,Genuine and warms your heart to the fullest,10,18 August 2013,"""My Girl"" is so true to life It really shows how kids are in reality: -Kids don't like their parents getting new girlfriends/boyfriend -Kids don't wear a new outfit every single day (if you noticed Vada had on many of the same outfits throughout the movie.) -Kids are curious about death. -Kids do not automatically know how to kiss (like they do in the movies) LOL! The movie adds plenty of humor to many of the situations. Not only will the movie make you laugh out loud, but you will be CRYING YOUR EYES OUT toward the ending (it is really sad). If you don't cry during the movie, or at least tear up, you must not have any heartfelt emotion at all (because even non-emotional people will cry). Many people are saying that the ending is ""tragic"" (which it is) but it teaches us a valuable lesson. And I think the people giving the movie bad reviews didn't see the true meaning or value in the movie, nor did they catch on to the lesson. Like seriously, enjoy the not-so-perfect Hollywood movie, stop searching for every possible flaw, because this is one of the most genuine films you'll ever watch. Not to mention the acting is amazing. Your heart will go out to Vada with all the things she has to go through: the thought that she killed her mother, her mentally ill grandmother, her dad owning a funeral parlor (which includes many funerals and dead people in the house), her dad getting a new girlfriend - which is the makeup artist for the dead people before they go to their funeral, and having her one friend that she is so lucky to have-Thomas J. After you watch this movie, it will always be in your heart. If you haven't seen ""My Girl"", you really should. It warms your heart in a way that no other movie could.",My Girl
125,clgap91,I feel that this is a touching movie.,9,3 May 2005,"I remember watching this movie with my Grandmother when I was around three or four years old. I could only remember two parts of it; when Vada does the sassy type walk across the porch, and when Thomas J. goes to find the mood ring, and nothing else. Not even the name. I watched it again for the first time in eleven years (I am now 14). This movie is a perfect mixture of comedy, romance and drama, for me at least. I think this movie teaches great values and lessons, that everyone should learn. Loyalty, friendship and love, are only a few things about this movie that I love. Everyone should at least give it a chance and see for themselves. I also recommend 'My Girl 2'.",My Girl

128,umutbaro,excellent and must to see...,10,14 August 2005,"""My Girl"" is the first movie that I was very impressed and appreciated, and the first movie that I remember to watch.When I first watch it, I was just 6-7 years old. And I fall in love with Vada(Anna Chlumsky).however far from that, the most impressive thing was the friendship(maybe the childhood love) between Thomas and Vada.Briefly, everyone should watch this movie, in order to absolutely understand a girl's mood in her current conditions.I would have to live such a love also; while sunset, on a tree, two children are kissing each other.this is a complimentary love.finally, Also special thanks to the producers of ""My Girl"" movie for giving us a chance to see such a perfect movie...",My Girl

130,A_Harrel,"A coming of age story, set in the summer of 1972 about an eleven year old girl (Vada), her best friend (Thomas J.), her widowed father, and crazy grandmother.",8,17 October 2005,"I think that My Girl is an excellent coming of age movie. I don't think that it is as predictable as most other coming of age stories, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. It has the same elements but definitely told in a different way. Anna Chlumsky's character seems to be extremely mature for her age but at the same time is still a child and extremely childish. I can relate to this character and I think most people can, growing up too fast and still holding on to being a child. Every time I watch this movie and find myself laughing and crying, it gets to me every time. Another aspect of this movie that I really like is that it's very innocent in comparison to most other coming of age stories that are produced these days. It's a great family movie and you don't have to worry about your child seeing something that you don't think they are ready to see. It touches base with many different aspects of growing up but in a tasteful manner which is hard to come by in movies these days. Overall, My Girl is a wonderful movie for people of all ages and I can honestly say that every time this movie is on television I stop what I'm doing to watch it. It never seems to get old to me.",My Girl

It was the first movie that made me feel feelings that were not purely happiness. Grief, sadness, and loss. I've had discussions with friends recently that have led us to realize something about this movie... ""My Girl"" is, hands down, the ""Manchester by the Sea"" of our generation.",My Girl
132,rainbow599,Loved it!!!,10,23 March 2006,"This movie had me laughing most of the time, but at the at the end crying my....this movie had everything in it...but above all things, it had love...Vada, was so different form any girl back when this movie was made....i remember sitting down and watching this movie as a little girl with my friends and cousins and always wondered why she was like that, but than one day i realized that it was here surroundings....took me long enough....if you haven't seen this movie than i am deeply shocked and pity you, and you should stop whatever you are doing and watch it....and if you are like ma you, will definitely enjoy this tear jerker, but if you are not like me, than i think that you should still go out and buy it...better yet, turn it into movie night with your family, friends, or just yourself!!!!....heads down, you will love it...or at least like it....",My Girl

134,simplexsong,Fantastic family film!,10,5 February 2006,"This movie has all of the traits of a marvelous movie. It's comedic, inspiring, and there's even a twist of romance between Chlumsky and Culkin. In my opinion, they couldn't have chosen a more perfect cast for My Girl. In a way, it even shows parents some reasons why children act in the ways that they do. I.E. Vada overcoming such terrible loses in her life so quickly. If you happen to be at a video rental store, or you see it on TV, I recommend you turn it on and watch it. There isn't a movie out there quite like My Girl. Though I must warn you, if you cry during movies, have a Kleenex box nearby; you're certainly going to need it!",My Girl
135,mcb-21130,Sad But Sweet,9,20 February 2019,"Vada Sultenfuss is the odd child in the bunch of children in Madison Pennsylvania in 1972, and has good reason to. She grew up without a mother, her father runs a funeral home that she lives in, and her grandmother has Alzheimer's and remains quiet aside from her outbursts of singing a popular 40s song. Because of this Vada is always running off to the doctors saying she has the symptoms of sicknesses she doesn't have. Her best friend, Thomas J. Sennett, is an unpopular kid who is allergic to everything. During her summer break, Vada has a crush on a teacher and joins the poetry class he is teaching. In the summer, she also meets Shelly, who takes the position of make-up artist at Harry's funeral home and will gradually become the motherly figure that Vada has always needed.
""My Girl"" is a coming to age film addressing topics that are seen as the harsh reality for children making the transition to the teenage years. Even though these are difficult topics to touch upon, I feel that the movie is able to put the difficult topics into a story where the audience is able to empathize with Vada going through this journey. Many big movie stars appeared in this movie including Macaulay Culkin, better known from Home Alone, and Dan Aykroyd, better known as Ray from Ghostbusters. Macaulay Culkin acted as Thomas J. Sennett, Vada's best friend, and Harry Sultenfuss acted by Dan Aykroyd, Vada's father.
Vada, having Thomas as her best and only good friend, was bound to eventually develop feelings for him. I think that Macaulay Culkin, although young, does a good job being this somewhat lost boy who really just cares a lot for his best friend Vada since he does not really talk to many other kids. The character of Harry is this father who is distant to his daughter and does not really know how to address the more sensitive topics with Vada. Through the film, we find that Harry develops as a character. In the beginning, Aykroyd plays the part of a parent unable to talk to his daughter about the harsh reality. He constantly gives Vada little to no eye contact whenever she is addressing him about anything. One example is when Vada comes into the house after talking to Mr. Bixler about his summer school class and she asks Aykroyd for $35 to attend the class. While Vada is asking, Aykroyd continues to watch the television and does not give Vada his full attention. We see a change in his treatment towards Vada as he starts to recognize that she dislikes Shelly, the new makeup artist. Shelly also brings about a different side of Harry that we don't expect from the beginning of the movie. With the presence of Shelly, Harry seems to be a lot more upbeat and lively despite operating a funeral home. The changes in Harry due to both the new cosmetologist and his daughter are displayed well by Aykroyd's acting.
Another thing that this film does well with is incorporating small drops comedy in the film to help lighten the mood of what would be a rather depressing plot by itself. The film opens with Vada coming to the conclusion that she is developing cancer because of the faster development of her left breast resulting in what she thinks will become a tumor. From this we are able to not only realize this is a coming to age movie, but we also see that there is going to be these kind of jokes dropped in the movie to relieve the stress of a sad plot. Vada when she arrives for her first day of class with Mr. Bixler enters the room and is the only child attending the class. To add some comic relief to this scene, the poems read are much too explicit for the ears of children, but the content of the poems is hidden through the use of innuendos. This helps to give the older audience watching a little bit of a laugh. These small moments of comic relief help to make the movie not just feel like a drag being sad the entire time. It adds a little bit of fun while keeping the overall mood of the scene.
The movie, ""My Girl"" is one that I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a family-tear jerker movie. The excellent acting along with the strategic placement of comic relief in the movie result in what I believe to be one of the movies that I have empathized with the most. The directing of the movie was very well done and I would recommend this movie to mostly families or as a nice movie to watch for a night out.",My Girl
