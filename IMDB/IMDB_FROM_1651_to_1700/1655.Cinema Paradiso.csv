0,MartinHafer,About as good an Italian film as you can find,10,12 July 2006,"With the exception of a few of De Sica's films during the Neorealist days of the 40s and 50s, I think this is the finest Italian film I have seen. It is highly reminiscent of Fellini's Amarcord, though even better (and that's saying a lot), because it offers a wonderful and nostalgic look back at how life used to be. And, it is told so gently and affectionately that you can't help but love the film and the characters. The film is named after the local theater because it is the focal point for this community through the many years the film encompasses. Gentle, beautiful and full of humor and grace--this is a wonderful film for pretty much the entire family and you can't help but admire all those associated with it.",Cinema Paradiso
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the best and most moving films of the 80s,10,17 July 2011,"As a big lover of film, I am still kicking myself for not seeing this masterpiece any sooner. To me, Cinema Paadiso is one of the best films of the 80s and also the most moving, particularly in the final hour.I have seen many visually stunning films, and Cinema Paradiso is up there as one of the most visually ravishing films I've seen. The cinematography and editing are outstanding, and the scenery still looks gorgeous with an epic feel to it. Cinema Paradiso, alongside The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West, also contains one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting scores and it is also one of my favourites of his.Cinema Paradiso is immaculately directed, has an touching, beautifully-written and honest script and a rich, compelling story that while it has an elegiac feel moves swiftly by draws you right in until the ending, which breaks my heart still after 5 times of seeing it.The characters are very well defined, particularly Alfredo, and the acting is outstanding with Salvatore Cascio, Enzo Cannavale, Marco Leonardi and especially Phillippe Noiret particularly impressive. All in all, a masterpiece. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Cinema Paradiso
2,SnoopyStyle,a little bit of movie magic,8,10 November 2015,"Famed film director Salvatore Di Vita has become jaded and unloved. Even his mother has difficulty finding him. He recalls his childhood nicknamed Toto in a post-war small town. The priest would cut out all the kisses in the movies. Projectionist Alfredo at the Cinema Paradiso becomes Toto's mentor. A film catches fire burning down the cinema and blinding Alfredo. Toto runs in to save Alfredo's life. The cinema is rebuild and Toto becomes the new projectionist. As a teen, he would find love and lose love. The adult Salvatore returns to town to attend Alfredo's funeral. The cinema is demolished. In Alfredo's home, he finds an unexpected film reel.I love the childhood Toto. The kid is precocious and charming. His chemistry with Philippe Noiret is wondrous. The teenage years are less kind. The teen Toto isn't as charismatic and the teenage love isn't anything special. Then there is the final film clips. It is some kind of movie magic. I actually cried a little when the film gets going with that beautiful music. It is incredible powerful and poignant.",Cinema Paradiso
3,Hitchcoc,A Film for the Ages,10,26 January 2016,"A village comes to life as a man dreams of a character who directed his entire life. He was a projectionist a run down movie theater which formed the center of entertainment in the community. We are introduced to Toto who lives with his mother who waits for her husband to come home from the Russian front. He is a scalawag who disobeys her and finds ways to spend time with Alfredo, the protectionist. He is in constant trouble but always comes to this man for direction, even though the guy finds him to be a pain in the butt. One night, the movie projector catches fire as does the film (nitrate film did this in the early days) and blinds the old man. Toto becomes the projectionist, even though he is but ten years old. He also becomes the eyes of his friend. He stays at the job, ignoring school, and eventually makes some modest films himself. As he does this, he sees a beautiful young woman with whom he falls in love. This whole film captures the essence of the city. We get to know a multitude of characters because their lives revolve around the movies being shown at the Cinema Paradiso. Toto (not his real name) returns to his home when his mother leaves a message for him that Alfredo has died. He has really cut off ties with the place and it is a painful trip back. But it pulls at our hearts. Things are almost magical. One of the best films every made.",Cinema Paradiso
4,boblipton,A Movie For Movie Lovers,10,19 March 2020,"Is there any way for someone who has chosen the movies over life to write anything sensible about this movie for an audience who have made the same choice? I could talk about the way that Philippe Noiret's performance dominates the movie, but he is the only actor who plays his role from start to finish. Certainly, if Giuseppe Tornatore had set out to make a feature intended to win a Best Foreign Picture Oscar, he couldn't have plotted more cannily.It is, after all, a movie about how we start out as small children, trying to make sense out of the world, with nothing to guide us but stories in the dark.... and in the end, we end up that way, nostalgic for a time when we were confident that some day all would be revealed.Well, it hit all my buttons. Still, as I noted at the start, I chose the movies over life.",Cinema Paradiso
5,classicsoncall,"""Friends, this cinema is for you.""",9,9 August 2014,"A sincere love of film and attention to detail is readily apparent in director Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Cinema Paradiso"". I was struck by the many creative elements employed in the picture, like Alfredo's (Philippe Noiret) decision to broadcast a movie on the side of a building and how the mother's crocheting unraveled as she went to answer the door for the returning Salvatore near the end of the picture. Earlier, when Salvatore/Toto was still a child and anxious about his father returning from the War, his mother's response was ""It takes years to go there (Russia), years to come back"". But then when it was confirmed that the father died in the War, the pair pass by an advertisement for 'Via Col Vento' - ""Gone With the Wind"". For young Toto, it was as if his father never even existed.I also got a big kick out of the parish priest Father Adelfio (Leopoldo Trieste), who deemed himself the final arbiter of holiness and good taste in censoring every movie scene that dared to show intimacy between a man and a woman. Doesn't everyone know someone who takes this moral high ground? As a somewhat humorous aside, I had an aunt like that once, who made similar judgments because of her upbringing and religion. Before she passed away, she left me some money which I used to purchase an artist's rendering of a female super-hero, something she would not have approved of. I swear, for the first few weeks I had it displayed with other pieces of art, every morning it would be slightly askew from it's original position, like she was disapproving from beyond and letting me know. I kid you not.What's truly magical about the film though, is the special relationship developed between Alfredo and his young ward Toto, how he takes him under his wing and nurtures the boy's talents and inspires him to move away from Giancaldo to make his own way in the world. With his blindness, Alfredo sees better than Toto himself that his job as projectionist at the cinema is only temporary and that he must make more of himself.There are so many nuances in the film that it would be impossible for me to discuss them all here, in fact it takes repeated viewings of the movie to catch the many insights Tornatore provides. He constructs his story with little hints of what leads to the cleverest of conclusions when Salvatore watches the reel that Alfredo leaves for him upon his passing, a touching commentary on life and love that the old man conveys to his former student as a keepsake and reminder of their time together.",Cinema Paradiso
6,gavin6942,A Movie-Lovers Film,7,30 September 2014,"A filmmaker recalls his childhood, when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist.In many ways, this film anticipates ""The Long Day Closes"" and ""Hugo"". While ""Cinema Paradiso"" is probably not the first movie about enjoying movies, it is easily the most successful and critically acclaimed. Terence Davies was likely influenced, and there is no doubt that Martin Scorsese was.""Cinema Paradiso"" was shot in director Tornatore's hometown of Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea. This makes the film somewhat more interesting for Sicilians in Wisconsin, as they largely trace their roots to Bagheria. Myself, though not Sicilian, have extensively studied the Italians of Milwaukee and find this connection fascinating. (The Sicilian roots are explored a bit more on the Blu-ray in ""A Dream of Sicily"", which looks into the life of director Giuseppe Tornatore.)The themes of the film are many, and go beyond the simple love of film or seeing film as a background of our lives (which is a feeling many cinephiles share). We have the role of religion, with some excessive priestly censorship of the films within the film, even cutting out a ""chaste kiss"". There is the theme of the Mafia, which is unfortunately an ever-present aspect of the Sicilian way of life. We see that mob boss ""Don Vincenzo"" has complete control of employment (and an unusual rapport with Edward G. Robinson). Although he is not a major character, he plays an interesting role for being opposed by the village priest, and the way the populace accepts him is striking.""Cinema Paradiso"" has countless nods to Fellini, quite possibly the biggest influence on Tornatore (and many other Italians). Interestingly, Fellini was going for ""realism"" (or neo-realism) in his work, and much of this film covers similar themes but plays them for laughs (at least in the first half). This is homage in its purest form -- taking a source and inverting, subverting it.The film was rightly honored by many, not least of which was at the Academy Awards. What is most surprising is that the Criterion Collection did not scoop this title up years ago. But luckily for us, Arrow Academy is giving Criterion a run for their money and offers an impressive set for ""Paradiso"" fans. Both the theatrical cut and director's cut are in the set, providing an additional 50 minutes of footage, including a crucial romantic scene that is entirely excised in the shorter version.The Arrow set also has ""A Dream of Sicily"", a 52-minute reflection on Tornatore's career, interviews with the key actors, a breakdown of the kissing montage, and more. Yale professor Millicent Marcus, who has authored many books on Italian cinema including ""Italian Film in the Shadow of Auschwitz"", provides a very insightful commentary (in English!), not only elucidating the finer points of the film, but pointing out connections to other, lesser-known works of Italian cinema.",Cinema Paradiso
7,lee_eisenberg,In memory of Philippe Noiret,10,24 November 2006,"Philippe Noiret's death yesterday brings to mind all his movies, including ""Nuovo cinema Paradiso"". The first time that I saw this was right after I had seen ""The Postman"", and I recognized him as the man who had played Pablo Neruda. Here, he plays an equally great role, of the operator of a camera in a movie theater in an Italian village in years past. His friendship with and advice to young Salvatore proves to be more than the boy could have ever dreamed about. In a sense, the movie seems to be a look not only at what Italy was, but also what going to the movies was. It's definitely a masterpiece that I recommend. There may be the issue of whether or not we should make Italy's past look so idealistic, given that Mussolini was in power at the time. But I would assert that this movie shows that even in times of oppression, people can find ways to escape it. A really good movie.",Cinema Paradiso
8,jboothmillard,Cinema Paradiso,9,12 November 2012,"Many of the films listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die have interesting and good sounding titles, including the foreign language ones, and this Italian one I was very intrigued by because it sounded like something I would love, and it was rated well by the critics. Basically, in 1980s Rome, Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) is a famous and successful Italian film director. Returning home late one night, his sleepy girlfriend tells him that his mother telephoned to tell him that someone called Alfredo has died. It is obvious he has shied away from committed relationships and his family in Giancaldo, Sicily, the story flashes back thirty years to see who Alfredo was. After the Second World War, highly intelligent and mischievous six-year-old Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (BAFTA winning Salvatore Cascio) has a love for films. He spends most of his time going to the local movie house, Cinema Paradiso, and gets to know the projectionist Alfredo (BAFTA winning Philippe Noiret), who for a while finds his presence annoying and he gets frustrated. Slowly though Alfredo takes a shine to Toto and they form a close friendship, as the projectionist allows him to watch movies from the projection booth, and he teaches him how to load and operate the film projector because of his fascination with his work. They often hear the audience boo when sections of films are missing, especially those where characters in the movies are embracing romance with kissing. The film jumps these moments, as the scenes have been cut out, under the orders of local priest Father Adelfio (Leopoldo Trieste) who wants the films ""censored"", all of the scenes are piled on the projection room floor. One night one of the movies, made of the routine highly flammable Nitrate film, catches fire and causes some of the movie house to burn, Toto notices this and manages to save Alfredo's life, but consequently an explosion burned Alfredo's face and permanently blinds him. Eventually Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by town citizen Ciccio who invests his football winnings, as the only capable hand, Toto is made projectionist. A decade passes, adolescent Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita (Marco Leonardi) is now in high school and still a projectionist at the ""Nuevo Cinema Paradiso"". He still has a strong relationship with blind Alfredo, he often takes his advice about his personal life, such as being in love, and this advice is given with him quoting classic movies. Toto has started experimenting in his own filmmaking using his home movie camera, while doing this he sees and is attracted to wealthy banker's daughter Elena Mendola (Agnese Nano). He wins her heart with his charm, but her father does not approve and forces them apart, and when her family is moving away at the same time it is compulsory that Toto serves in military service. While there he tries to communicate with Elena with letters, but they are returned undeliverable, when he eventually returns Alfredo is urging him to leave Giancaldo permanently with no explanation. He says he wants him to achieve his dreams for filmmaking, the town is not big enough, and if he does pursue his ambition he should go and never return, and never write. Back in the present, Salvatore is desperate to return to Giancaldo for the funeral of his friend, he finds that the town has changed a lot, and he finds out why he was told to leave. Salvatore is told by Alfredo's widow that he followed his film directing career with high interest and pride, his dying gifts to his friend are an unlabelled reel of film and the stool that he operated the projector on. The sad news is that the Cinema Paradiso is being demolished to make way for parking spaces, many of the people in the village gather to watch as the building comes down, many of whom Toto recognises. The end of the film sees Salvatore return home to Rome, he takes the reel of film he was given by Alfredo to a cinema, as it plays he discovers it is every romantic scene cut (including The Gold Rush and His Girl Friday) by the priest, put together in a special montage, in floods of happy tears Salvatore has made peace with his past. Also starring Pupella Maggio as old Maria Di Vita, Antonella Attili as young Maria Di Vita, Isa Danieli as Anna, Enzo Cannavale as Spaccafico, Nicola Di Pinto as Village Idiot, Roberta Lena as Lia and Nino Terzo as Peppino's Father. Noiret gives a really nice performance as the initially grumpy but then absolutely lovable projectionist who is an inspiration to his young friend, and the supporting cast members all do their parts well also, especially Cascio as the child filmmaker that grows up to achieve this ambition. The story is easy to follow, the characters are lovable, the plot lines inside and outside the cinema are interesting and fun, if you are a big fan of watching films, this picture really expresses the magic of escaping the everyday world and entering the spirit of movie going, it is a most enjoyable drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, Best Original Film Score for Ennio Morricone and Andrea Morricone and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Direction for Giuseppe Tornatore, Best Editing, Best Make Up Artist and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!",Cinema Paradiso
9,ccthemovieman-1,The Loves Of 'Toto' Beautifully Told,8,21 March 2006,"After seeing this special edition DVD which shows the entire 174-minute film (in addition to the 121-minute one that most of us had seen over the years,) my rating of this film was elevated. This review is of the longer ""director's cut.""Most of the new footage involved the main's character's romance while he was a young man. The story then is continued years later when that character comes back to his hometown for a funeral and runs into the woman he was in love with but never was able to get for his own. It turns out to be a somewhat tragic love story.The first part of the film, with Salvatore Cascio as ""Toto"" a young boy is a love story about two people sharing their love of movies: the kid and an adult ""Alfredo"" (Phillpe Noiret) who runs the local movie theater. Their love of film bonds them for life.The word ""love"" is used repeatedly in this review because that's the dominant theme: the love people had for others and for the world of film, something all of us on this website share.The second and third parts of the film are the above-mentioned love story of Toto (Marco Leonardi as an adolescent and then Jacques Perrin as an adult) and ""Elena"" (Agnese Nano/ Brigitte Fossey). The first third of this director;s cut edition is much livelier and interesting, frankly, than the last two-thirds. Although not boring, it does drag in a few spots but the longer version is better in the long run because it makes the whole story much more meaningful.It's very nicely filmed and you get a real feel for the Italian people and their little town. The director of the movie, Giuseppe Tornatore, went on to make other great visual films, two of which I also like: Malena and The Star Maker.....but Cinema Paradiso, I believe, is considered his ""masterpiece.""",Cinema Paradiso
10,ma-cortes,Stunning film with great sense and sensibility ; being compellingly directed by Giuseppe Tornatore,7,5 March 2014,"Colorful and moving flick dealing with a wonderful friendship between a little boy and a solitary projectionist . However , being overly nostalgic , too sentimental and overwhelmingly sweet . Attractive and sensitive picture with stirring drama , ravishing cinematography and enjoyable musical score . A filmmaker (Jacques Perrin , he subsequently became a notorious director) recalls his childhood (Salvatore Cascio , Toto , who celebrated his eighth birthday during filming) , when he fell in love with the movies at his village's theater and formed a deep friendship with the theater's projectionist (Philippe Noiret who said all his lines in French) at Cinema Paradise . The director goes back home to his Sicilian village for the first time after almost 30 years and is reminded of his first love (Antonella Attili) . It is an interesting celebration of youth, friendship, and the everlasting magic of the films . Nostalgic and sensitive picture with thought-provoking drama , ravishing cinematography and moving musical score . The picture contains drama and nostalgia completely wrapped in an agreeable story between a lone man and a boy . The flick relies heavily on the relationship between an older man and a kid , subsequently teenager , but this does not get bored or spoils the tale . Slightly overrated but excellent all the same time , the picture is enjoyable and entertaining , but overlong . The story is narrated with great sense and sensibility , the intelligent screenplay was written by the same Giuseppe Tornatore . Giuseppe's intention was that this movie should serve as an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry in general , after the movie's success he never mentioned this again. This excellent and enthralling picture ¨Cinema Paradise¨ was starred by extraordinary actors such as Philippe Noiret , Jacques Perrin and Marco Leonardi . Good acting from remaining cast , just like Antonella Attili , Enzo Cannavale , Leopoldo Triestre , Agnese Nano , Pupella Maggio, among others . Glowing cinematography with scenarios colorfully and stunningly photographed by Blasco Giurato who reflects splendidly the cinema , streets , square , village and many other things . Rousing as well as insistent score musical , including a continuous leitmotif from the beginning to the end ; being efficiently composed by the veteran master and prolific Ennio Morricone . The film won several nominations and awards , Oscar included .This weeper picture was very well directed by Giuseppe Tornatore . He is a writer and director, known for making similar nostalgic films including good actors , such as ¨Malena¨ with Monica Belucci , ¨ The star maker¨ with Sergio Castellito , ¨Baaria¨ with Raoul Bova ; and ¨La Leggenda del Pianista Sull'Oceano"" (original title) or ""The Legend of 1900"" or ""The Legend of the Pianist on the Ocean with Tim Roth . Being his English-language debut feature titled ¨The professor¨ with Ben Gazzara . Cinema Paradise Rating : Better than average, well worth watching for exceptional cinematography , first-rate acting and marvelous score .",Cinema Paradiso
11,Quinoa1984,sentimental but very memorable tribute to anyone who loves to go to a movie,8,7 June 2008,"Cinema Paradiso works very well because Giuseppe Tornatore, for all his schmaltzy moments with his characters, loves cinema incredibly and especially the communal and personal act of going out to see a movie. It also works because for all the sentiment, he makes it a story essentially about a boy, Toto, without a father after the war who finds a surrogate-cum-mentor with Alfredo, the projectionist at the theater. Their bond makes for the emotional core of the film, as the grown-up Toto comes back to the town he left so long ago for Alfredo's funeral, and looks back on his childhood and adolescence in this small down of Giacardola.The clips of the films are one of the strong-points, and just the scenes inside of the Paradiso, where there's lots of warm human comedy coming out of the fun poked at the 'old-days' of repression (i.e. ringing the bell for a kissing scene), or just the reactions to the different genres and styles (everything from Visconti to Chaplin to Bardot is screened). And there's a whole host of characters Tornatore has that makes a lot of the first half of the picture pretty special.It's maybe in the second half that it got a little too 'adorable' for its own good, or just too much of a similar one-track kind of narrative with the teen Toto falling in love with a girl whom makes it his first real roller-coaster of a relationship. But, as mentioned, Tornatore keeps it simple, particularly with respect to Toto and Alfredo (the latter actor, Phillipe Noiret, is incredible in the part, even when blind for half the running time). It's also a given that maestro Ennio Morricone delivers up the goods and makes this really rousing, the sentiment not false for a lot of the time as one of his best scores.If I didn't find it overall a masterpiece for some of its sappy bits and occasional over-the-top performance that doesn't click (most of them do, it's Italy after all), it's an exceptional effort for what it tries to accomplish and what many films end up being simply sappy can't quite reach. The film earns its keep by making it very relatable, and reminds us why some of us love movies and movie-going very much. It's the 'shmoopy' of Italian cinema lovers everywhere, and its worth the view even in the truncated Harvey Weinstein cut that played at the Rialto theater near my town; a fond goodbye at a fondly remembered theater. 8.5/10",Cinema Paradiso
12,BandSAboutMovies,Perfect,10,18 January 2021,"Every once in a while, I finally have a movie on the site that I can share with my mom.New Paradise Cinema was written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore and was well-known in the U.S. when it came out in 1988, winning the Best Foreign Film Academy Award.One morning in Rome, a famous film director named Salvatore Di Vita - played by a real-life famous filmmaker, Jacques Perrin - wakes up to his girlfriend telling him that Alfredo has died. She has no idea who that is, as Salvatore is a closed book, a man who will not commit and who has not returned home for three decades. This is but the beginning of the story.Eight years after World War II, Salvatore was Toto, the son of a widow who spends every second that he can at Cinema Paradiso, the movie house where he becomes friends with Alfredo (Philippe Noiret, Topaz), a middle-aged man who allows him to sit in the projection booth and watch the films. As Rome is such a religious town, the local priests have demanded that any moment of romance must be deleted from the films, at which point the audience shots in anger.Toto soon learns to run the projector, but one night, as he steals the projector to watch The Firemen of Viggiù on a wall of a house, the cinema catches on fire. Toto saves his friend, but a film canister explodes, destroying the man's sight. When the theater is rebuilt, Toto becomes the projectionist and Alfredo assists him.After growing up, Salvatore falls for the young Elena Mendola, an experience that teaches him love but breaks his heart when she must move away and is forbidden to even write him. He has also started to make films of his own. Alfredo tells the young man that he must leave his hometown behind and devote himself to being an artist. He must never visit. He must never give in to nostalgia.Now, thirty years later, Cinema Paradiso is being torn down to make a parking lot and the people of the town carry Alfredo's coffin through the streets. The projectionist's widow has something that the old man left for the filmmaker, though. All of the scenes of kissing, of lust, of love - all the moments that the clergy demanded destroyed - all survived to make one reel of romantic longing that Alfredo had kept for Salvatore for all these years. Watching this movie allows the now old Toto to make peace with where he came from.The director's cut of the film shows what happens when an older Salvator and Elena meet and the note that she had sent him decades ago, one that Alfredo had kept hidden inside Cinema Paradiso, all so that his friend could become a success.Made in Bagheria, Sicily, Tornatore's hometown, this film was inspired by the director's childhood. He originally wanted it to be an obituary for traditional movie theatres and the movie industry.",Cinema Paradiso
13,sunwarrior13,"A Film That Offers Issues About Youth, Coming Of Age And Reflections In Adulthood About The Past",10,4 March 2012,"Cinema Paradiso, is an Italian drama film written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore. The film stars Jacques Perrin, Philippe Noiret, Leopoldo Trieste, Marco Leonardi, Agnese Nano and Salvatore Cascio; produced by Franco Cristaldi and Giovanna Romagnoli, and the music by Ennio Morricone along with his son, Andrea.Shot in director Tornatore's hometown Bagheria, Sicily, as well as Cefalù on the Tyrrhenian Sea,and told largely in flashback of a successful film director Salvatore to his childhood years, it also tells the story of the return to his native Sicilian village for the funeral of his old friend Alfredo, who was the projectionist at the local ""Cinema Paradiso"". Ultimately, Alfredo serves as a wise father figure to his young friend who only wishes the best to see him succeed, even if it means breaking his heart in the process.Cinema Paradiso offers a nostalgic look at films and the effect they have on a young boy who grows up in and around the title village movie theater in this Italian comedy drama that is based on the life and times of screenwriter/director Giuseppe Tornatore. The story begins in the present as a Sicilian mother pines for her estranged son, Salvatore, who left many years ago and has since become a prominent Roman film director who has taken the advice of his mentor too literally. He finally returns to his home village to attend the funeral of the town's former film projectionist, Alfredo, and, in so doing, embarks upon a journey into his boyhood just after WWII when he became the man's official son. In the dark confines of the Cinema Paradiso, the boy and the other townsfolk try to escape from the grim realities of post-war Italy. The town censor is also there to insure nothing untoward appears on screen, invariably demanding that all kissing scenes be edited out. One day, Salvatore saves Alfredo's life after a fire, and then becomes the new projectionist. A few years later, Salvatore falls in love with a beautiful girl who breaks his heart after he is inducted into the military. Thirty years later, Salvatore has come to say goodbye to his life-long friend, who has left him a little gift in a film can. Still rapturous after all these years, Cinema Paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love as it is seen as an example of ""nostalgic post-modernism"",the film intertwines sentimentality with comedy, and nostalgia with pragmatism. It explores issues of youth, coming of age, and reflections in adulthood about the past.",Cinema Paradiso

The fantasy medium that allows to escape into other places, other cultures, is the subject of this wonderful picture from Italy. Nuovo cinema Paradiso"" takes a view at two people so different, yet so alike, because their love for this type of entertainment.The story of Toto, a young boy who loves to escape to the local movie palace and his relationship with Alfredo, his friend, and mentor, is one of the most beautiful films that have come from Italy in recent memory. We watched the film when it first opened in New York, and were lucky enough to renew our joyous experience not long ago when a friend lent us a copy on DVD format.Giuseppe Tornatore, the director, created a film that will never die as long as there are fans for pictures such as this one. The story about the golden days, not only of Hollywood, but the Italian cinema after WWII is captured in vivid detail. The casting proved also to be a lucky break for the director. Phillipe Noiret, one of the best actors of his generation makes a wonderful Alfredo. Salvatore Cascio steals the heart of the viewer just by being himself. The legendary Leopoldo Trieste appears as the priest who censures any picture that will show at the Paradiso. It was a joy to revisit an old friend!",Cinema Paradiso
15,Doylenf,Exquisite nostalgia that any movie fan can identify with...,8,29 April 2006,"This is such a difficult film to describe in words because all of it is heartfelt emotion. However, it must be noted that the three central performances are beyond reproach: the child Salvatore (played with rascally charm by Salvatore Cascio), the brusque projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) and the adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi). All three are masterful in creating the viewer's emotional attachment to these characters. The relationship between the tough but tender projectionist and the little boy is what carries the first half of the film and it continues when the boy becomes a lovesick adolescent. It is only the last half of the film that seems to drag a little with scenes of the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin)contemplating returning to the little village where he grew up in the shadows of the movie theater and those wonderful silver shadows on the screen.All of the scenes involving the movie theater and its rowdy audiences are wonderfully realized with crude humor and insight into the kind of characters who thrived on whatever entertainment films could offer. Ennio Morriconne's music is charming throughout, always totally in keeping with the images on screen and the intentions of the story.By all means, well worth seeing and treasuring as one of the great foreign films to come out of the 1980s. I watched the abbreviated version on TCM which comes to a little more than two hours and is the version shown in the U.S. theatrically.",Cinema Paradiso
16,preppy-3,Classic,10,1 July 2002,"This 1988 Italian film (released in the US in 1990), is back with a full 51 minutes added on. This seemed like a stupid idea...there was nothing wrong with the original. The directors cut (which was 1/2 hour longer) was considered a mess. Also, for this release, an extra 1/2 hour was added! I expected the worse. Well, I was pleasantly surprised that this 3 hour version is better than the 2 hour one.This story follows the life of Salvatore. He's born in a tiny Italian village and we see him as a little boy in the 1930s, an adolescent in the 40s-50s and an adult in the 80s. It basically is about his love of movies and the one true love of his life--Elena. They are in love but she comes from a rich family and he lives in poverty. How can they be together?POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!!The cut movie in the US excised a lot of the Elena subplot and concentrated on Salvatore's love of movies. There's nothing wrong with that, but Elena disappears quite suddenly. This full version explains what happened between them and fleshes out the characters more. It also reveals a crucial surprise at the end.The performances are all fantastic--especially by the gorgeous young actor playing Salvatore as a teenager. Elena is also stunning. The film has beautiful cinematography and a haunting music score. The 3 hours flew by for me. I didn't want it to end!

Beginning in post war Italy, we are in the small Sicilian town of Giancaldo where young ""Totó"" ( a magnificent Salvatore Cascio) hangs about the local cinema, entranced by what it has to offer and badgering his tolerant friend, the projectionist ""Alfredo"" (Philippe Noiret) in the process. His father went off to fight on the Russian front and has yet to return, leaving him at home with his mother and younger sister and their relationship, though loving, is lively as the young boy neglects his school work - and frequently falls asleep during mass, not ideal when he is supposed to be an altar boy - and his mother tries to make do in time of considerable austerity. The cinema - and his friend there - soon become an obsession that gives the boy's life diversion, meaning and fulfilment - and induction that leads to a successful movie career in the present day from which this reflection is told when his modern day self learns of the death of ""Alfedo"" and he lies in bed reminiscing. It's divided, roughly, into three phases, my favourite being the early story featuring the younger character which is full of humour and pathos. The priest acting as censor, ringing his bell any time anyone got even remotely near a passionate clinch (Heaven only knows what he'd have made of ""Game of Thrones""!) shows us just how the influential the Catholic church was in the evolution of the cinema - not just Italian made, at that - and thereby in the evolution of society and attitudes towards love and sex in a poignant but comical fashion. The story continues with the developing relationship between the young boy, his mentor and his cinematic passion with joy and tragedy ensuing as he reaches his early manhood and discovers girls, love, rejection and his National Service... Cascio is a revelation - and I am rarely fond of child actors. He carries off the characterisation of the mischievous, enquiring and ultimately loyal young boy to perfection; Noiret is fantastic as is Leopoldo Trieste as ""Father Adelfio"" and the photography from Blasco Giurato does wonderful justice to an excellent, gentle, story from director Giuseppe Tornatore that is superbly accompanied by a rather different style of Ennio Morricone score that subtly and generously envelops the whole thing. A thing of beauty, this is. Truly.",Cinema Paradiso
18,dbborroughs,Love Letter to the Movies,10,24 April 2004,"The memory play of a movie of a film director who returns to his home for the funeral of his father figure, is one of the best films about movies ever made. Certainly its probably the greatest film about the love of film the medium has ever produced. It is not a flawless film, the romance in the latter half of the film isn't as strong as everything else and it weakens, some what the rest of the film. Even so I wouldn't change a frame of the film. I love the Ennio Morricone score, which is haunting even now three years since I last saw the film. If you love movies see this film, its a glorious tribute to life in the cinema, as maker, projector and most of all watcher. And I dare any truly diseased film lover to watch the film from start to finish and not cry at the end, that  one sequence says more about what movies do for us than anything else.

This is, simply, one of the Best, Most Magical, Enchanting, Beguiling, One-Off movies that ever came down the pike. Try as I might I can't think of a single mediocre performance, let alone a bad one, the principals are beyond superb and what a joy, for example, to find that an adult Brigit Fossey is just as bewitching as an adult as she was as a six-year-old in Jeux Interdit, and how full circle that she is playing an adult in another film about childhood innocence. There's something of the Pagnols about it as Tornatore creates a whole community and peoples it with living, breathing people, just as Pagnol before him did with the Midi. It's such a joy to find a film celebrating Cinema and all it stands for, all it means to children everywhere.",Cinema Paradiso

Simple yet powerful story, well told.Not perfect - a bit uneven at times. Some events are overdramatised and some scenes are less consequential than the attention given to them. Plus, the apparent moral of the story (Alfredo's philosophy) is possibly not such a great philosophy.However, you will easily forget the flaws once the movie is over.

The best way to describe the kind of movie we're dealing with here is to say that if you liked ""Life Is Beautiful"" you will like ""Cinema Paradiso."" People who don't like foreign movies like this one because, if you take away the Italian subtitles, this film is as fake and schlocky as the worst piece of sentimental clap-trap churned out by the Hollywood myth-making machine. Not one single moment of this movie rang true for me. Subtlety was passed over on every occasion for the the most manipulative of cinematic tricks, and the love story that anchors the film is boring and completely missing any sort of sexual spark.I have a feeling that this movie is so beloved because people who in reality have pretty low-brow movie tastes can watch it and feel like they're cinematically smarter.

Salvatore Di Vita has become a successful film maker in Rome and hasn't been home in 30 years. Alfredo was the projectionist for the cinema. He befriends young Sal nicknamed Toto. Alfredo becomes more like a father figure to Toto since his father died in World War II. We watch Sal's life as reflects upon the loss of Alfredo. The film has a great cast and crew. It's absolutely heartbreaking by the end. The cast is superb with Jacques Perrin as the older Sal. I don't cry but I did today. It takes a lot for me to cry.

As a young boy I went to the movie theater with my Mom every Friday afternoon at the Lefferts Theater on Liberty Ave., in Richmond Hill, N.Y. and grew to love all the films just as the young boy in this film. It is very easy to see why this film received so much wonderful praise and awards. There was plenty of funny comedy when the Roman Catholic Priest censored all the films shown in the theater that showed any form of kissing or physical contact between a male or female. It was a great down to earth film which words cannot describe fully, and can only be appreciated by people who love to escape into the World of Film and stories.

25,ElMaruecan82,"Not just a poignant ode to Cinema's Golden Age, but a powerful invitation to discover our own...",8,25 November 2015,"The first time I saw « Nuovo Cinema Paradiso », I was about the same age of its young hero, 'Toto"" and I enjoyed the film, for at least half of it. The fire scene marked a departure from the joyful insouciance of the early memories to a succession of situations I found hackneyed even at that time. Indeed, once the pretty girl get in the picture, I started yawning. Quite an ironical paradox that a movie resurrecting childhood magic and the power of imagination couldn't appeal to a child because of the very parts that needed to abandon the optimistic tone of childhood.My brother was just born at that time and now, he's 22. Naturally, the film felt like a totally different experience, and I was even surprised that it lasted two hours as I recalled it being longer, funny how memories tend to distort reality. Still, I wished the theme of childhood had been more central to the plot, as the apprenticeship of young Toto was more powerfully drawn by the fact that he was a fatherless boy (the film opens in post-war Sicily) without as close ties with his mother as he had with the movies. Naturally, the local cinema projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) was the perfect counterpart to his father, and naturally, spending times watching movies was more exciting a premise as staying home. ""Cinema Paradiso"", on that level, is the stuff passions are made of.And one can understand from the perspective of a young altar boy how a passion for movies can easily grow. The kid probably didn't spend much time doing kids' stuff, working with the priest and having to endure hours and hours of silence, sermons and slowness, but at what price: the total opposite actually, watching the film like in premieres while the priest is ready to toss his bell anytime a kiss or passion is expressed passion, signaling Alfredo to put a mark on the reel and later cut the offensive parts, leaving sad relics of celluloid in a bucket, that naturally, young Toto want to keep. As a film about and for people worshiping movies, it is funny that the churchman is the blasphemous one. Again, Cinema is God, Alfredo is the 'Holy Father' and it's up to 'Toto' to find the 'Holy Spirit'.Speaking of Alfredo, we can all relate to that mentor relationship, the little glow on our eyes when we listened to the one figure that incarnated our dreams. And Alfredo is all the more appealing because he does his best dissuading Toto to do his job, which consists on repeating the same movements, watching the same films over and over again, suffocating in summer and trembling in winter. He makes the job sound like hell, but for 'Toto', this Cinema is his 'Paradiso'. But it's not as 'black-and-white', so to speak, Alfredo enjoys watching people laughing or crying, he feels as if he's the one generating these emotions. And that's subtle genius, as one of my all-time pleasures has always been to show movies and I could watch the same ones over a week, if I could earn the satisfaction of making a friend or a relative discovering a gem, it was all worth it.This generosity reaches its emotional climax when Alfredo pleases the townspeople by projecting a movie in a big wall, foreshadowing the drive-in movies. This is the most magical moment of the film, and I always regret that it has to foreshadow the tragic fire scene that would partially destroy the theater but permanently cut Alfredo out of his job, as he would (another tragic irony) turn blind because of the chemical fumes. Things could have been worse, as it was little Toto who pulled by the strength of his love, the big Alfredo out of the flaming room. And this shows how ungrateful a job this is, being the man in the shadow, the projectionist would have been totally forgotten, if it wasn't for the only boy who got interested in his job, so (no pun intended) it made natural that the torch would be passed to Toto.This is the part where I lose the track a little, and I don't think the film is perfect all the way, but the truth is that, for all the little unnecessary moments, there are some magnificent exchanges with the older and wiser Alfredo, as we finally get to understand what he meant by dissuading Toto to do this job. It is one thing to show movies, but you'll never get the same credit as if you were making them. In fact, the soul of a projectionist is to make movies, and Toto soon turns out to be Jacques Perrin as Guiseppe Tornatore's alter ego in the film, an established filmmaker, that was the only way to close his characters' arc. And this is why, as a guy who enjoyed making people discover movies, this sentiment has built up to the desire of making movies. And I guess, this is what the final extraordinary kissing montage exhilarates, the immortalizing power of Cinema, encapsulating passion and love and all human feelings like no medium has ever done, ""Romeo & Juliet"", ""Tristan & Isold"" are iconic love stories but do they hold a candle to the visual memories provided by, say, ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""From Here to Eternity""? Perrin crying while watching the iconic kissing montage is like he'd just revisited the roots of his passion, Cinema's Golden Age..Or was he also revisiting his own Golden Age, purely and simply, letting his inner child enjoying with the same eyes, and heart, the magic of the lost past. As unlimited as the Cinema is, maybe the ""Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"" transcends the limits of Cinema and is about something more deeply rooted in our hearts, something called nostalgia, our own personal Golden Age.",Cinema Paradiso
26,paul2001sw-1,Celluloid nostalgia,7,8 October 2012,"To those of us who live in places less beautiful than Sicily, and which have lost connection with their peasant heritage much longer ago, there's a natural appeal to stories from that island. 'Cinema Paradiso' provides a nostalgic look at post-war Sicily, and also of Italian cinema during that era; in the story of how progress led to television, the death of the cinema as a social institution and the individualisation of people's lives, it recalls 'The Last Picture Show'. There's similarity as well in the conflict between attachment to one's community and the desire to escape, although it lacks Peter Bogdanovich's film's sense of overwhelming claustrophobia. Indeed, the emotional temperature of the film is actually quite muted, in spite of the surface colour and vigour. I enjoyed it, but (especially in a setting with such a complex historical and political backdrop) it could have benefited from a shade more intensity.",Cinema Paradiso
27,MOscarbradley,A masterpiece restored.,10,12 August 2007,"You should approach any movie with the term 'director's cut' with caution. It can mean that we are now seeing the film the way the director intended it to been seen before the studio hacks got their hands on it or it could simply mean a lot more of the same, the unchecked ego of its creator. When ""Cinema Paradiso"" was first shown here it ran a very serviceable two hours and told the story of a boy, Toto, in Sicily whose love of cinema is instilled in him through his relationship with the elderly projectionist in the local movie house. The movie was told in flashback as the boy returns, a grown man and now a famous director himself, to his home town for the funeral of his friend and mentor. A sub-plot involving the girl he loved and lost to someone else was completely jettisoned.Now the film has been re-issued with this sub-plot restored to its rightful place and rather than detracting from the film's main theme it adds to it and deepens it. Now we can see that the boy's life was not only influenced by Alfredo, the projectionist, by making him aware of the joys of cinema but more directly, in a much more personal fashion. In a way it's like seeing a different movie but a much more rounded and mature one.Both versions are, of course, superb but while the shorter version plays heavily on the sentimentality quotient the longer version is a darker and sadder affair and allows Jacques Perrin to fully develop the character of the grown Toto, (in the shorter version we can only guess at his motivations). In this version Perrin's performance is just one in a trio of brilliant performances. As the child Toto, Salvatore Cascio holds the cuteness factor at just the right level while the great Philippe Noiret is perfectly marvellous as Alfredo. The shorter version will, of course, appeal to anyone who loves cinema, even remotely, (and Alfredo's 'gift' to Toto is director Giuseppe Tornatore's gift to us), but the longer version is a masterpiece that engages us on a much more profound level. However, neither of them should be missed.",Cinema Paradiso
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,In a word: nostalgic.,7,28 November 2020,"'Cinema Paradiso (1988)' is soaked, and I mean absolutely drenched, in nostalgia. In fact, it somehow makes you feel nostalgic for something you never even experienced. Framed as a trip into memory, the movie charts the formative years of Toto as he grows up in and around a thriving small-town cinema and strikes up a friendship with a coarse but kind-hearted projectionist. The picture does a great job in conveying the passage of time, with its eponymous picture-house going through as many - if not more - changes as its core characters. Though it does occasionally drag and, generally, has the tendency to meander, the experience is an oddly affecting one that remains engaging throughout. It has a palpable texture to it, too. Helped immensely by a stand-out (if somewhat repetitive) score from Ennio Morricone, the movie transports you to a distinct place and time in an almost melancholic way. It's by no means dour - in fact, it's often rather funny - but it definitely has more than tinge of regret to it. In the end, it can almost entirely be described as one thing: nostalgic. 7/10",Cinema Paradiso
29,ThomasDrufke,Time at the Movies,9,4 September 2015,"Certain films transcend the pages of the script and the screen and become something greater. Certain films become something that turns your eyes from just watching it play out, to experiencing the film through your entire emotional state. I guess what I mean is that Cinema Paradiso to me meant more than just another film. It made me feel unlike I ever had before. It's one of the best films for pure film buffs. Not only is it a deeply emotional experience but it's also a joy to watch.It tells the story of Toto, a famous filmmaker who looks back on his time growing up at a local movie theater and his deep bond with the theaters projectionist, Alfredo. There are plenty of great unlikely relationships in movies but none really moved me as much as Toto and Alfredo's. Even with the actor who played Alfredo having to develop chemistry with three different actors who portrayed Toto, it works. There's something to be said about that person in your life, family or not, who inspires you to become who you are and teaches you the do's and don'ts of life. Alfredo was that to Toto. As much as I loved that aspect of the movie, I was surprised to see just how well they were able to tell the history of film as well. Whether it was the film that burned, the excessive censorship, or all of the famous movie plus and references throughout, it was a masterful directing job.The film is also complimented by an all time great score and main theme. Most notably as Toto goes through his memories back at the Paradiso. A subtle romance story with Toto and Elena is also worth mentioning. It's just one of those movies that impacts you more than you think. I don't why it took me so long to actually watch the film.

This must be a feast for movie buffs who enjoy yesteryear's films, reminiscing the clips from countless films.As for the story, it really wasn't anything special. The friendship between the projectionist and the young boy, was a wonderful, touching story. Alfredo is a very likable character, and we feel for the young boy with his back story. There were some beautifully shot scenes. However, after the halfway mark, the film plunges into boredom, becoming a soppy love story that never pays off. It became sentimental and uninteresting.

It starts off showing the life of a young boy in an Italian town who befriends the projectionist of the local cinema. This part of the film is very sweet and is full of little moments like the town bonding, the boy sneaking into the projection room, the projectionist talking about his life and more. This all gives a well-rounded view of the boy's life and environment, which feels warm and true to life. The acting of the boy and the projectionist must be commended for a sense of genuine warmth. After a time skip, the young boy becomes a young man who takes over the projection booth. By this point, the repetition of the extended director's cut really starts to show badly. His desperate attempts at romance come across as annoying to watch. This really leads to confusion by the next time skip when she happily reunites with him.

37,didi-5,superb art-house movie about the movies,8,11 May 2004,"'Cinema Paradiso', in both its versions, is a wonderful movie all about movies, the love of the movies, movie images, and movie influences.  It is also about growing up, friendship, young love, regret, and the pursuit of happiness.We follow Salvatore (Toto) from being a young child, eyes wide with wonder at the world projected on the big screen, through his hesitant adolescence, to adulthood as a successful film-maker in his own right.  Playing Toto at the three stages of his life are two outstanding actors: Salvatore Cascio as the child, and Jacques Perrin as the adult still searching for the missing piece of his life's puzzle.  The teenage Toto is portrayed less well, by Marco Leonardi, perhaps because of his lack of screen time - although there is one sequence in particular concerning his character and that of Elisa which stands out.Also in the cast is the excellent Philippe Noiret as Alfredo, the cinema projectionist who becomes the sage, the wise voice of reason within Toto's life.For me, though, the best sequences are the ones which take place within the Cinema Paradiso - the snatches of famous films which play before us, the reactions of the audience, the whole ambience of a little flea pit.  And the famous final montage with the screen kisses is superb.

38,eddie_baggins,A joyous ode to cinema and love,8,18 March 2019,"You know what, shame on me as a cinema lover for not having seen 1988's beloved Oscar winning Italian film Cinema Paradiso sooner.A film that constantly appears on must-see film lists and sits comfortably within the IMDB's Top 100 films of all time, Giuseppe Tornatore's love letter to romance, growing up and most importantly cinema itself is a delightful film that 30 years on has lost none of its charm.Bought to English audiences in a shortened format (that cut over 20 minutes of footage from its original Italian version) upon initial release by Harvey Weinstein and his then up and coming company Miramax, Paradiso is one of those rare films that benefited from outside interference, focusing its attention on the lovable friendship between young boy/teenager Toto and Philippe Noiret's old school projectionist Alfredo and the power that cinema can have over our lives.Unfortunately the version of Cinema Paradiso I watched was the more recently released ""director's cut"" version of the film that takes the Oscar winning Weinstein cut and restores the film to its much longer near 3 hour version that Tornatore originally envisioned his film to be.This much more self-indulgent version of the simplistic tale still harbors many delights, such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score, brilliantly realized reincarnations of post-war Italian village life and the Cinema Paradiso itself, which is a place you'd wish you to could spend some quality time in, but overall it feels like the more streamlined version of this lovable tale is the way to go.From understanding, the director's cut features more long in the tooth scenes of Toto's teenage-hood and in particular more of Toto as a middle-aged man, drawn back to his small village that causes the now famous filmmaker to take pause and reconsider lost loves and life affirming friendships.These scenes and additions aren't particularly bad but there nowhere near as magical and entertaining as some of the films many early scenes, while some of the answers these additional scenes offer the stories aren't needed to enjoy the film more, if anything, providing answers we didn't really need to know.Despite the flaws in this directors cut, the core beauty and heartfelt nature of Tornatore's film is still readily accessible and as a love letter to cinema, it doesn't get much better than what the Paradiso has to offer, meaning for cinephiles, there will be barely a dry eye in the house as the credits begin to roll.Final Say -The type of cliché but fabulously magical tale we don't get anymore, Cinema Paradiso has aged beautifully over these 30 years and is a must-watch for any true fans of cinema, just make sure you track down the theatrical cut version.4 town squares out of 5",Cinema Paradiso

40,TheMovieDiorama,Cinema Paradiso sincerely captures the paradisiacal pleasure of film.,7,27 August 2019,"Bellissimo! One of life's greatest delectations is the medium of film, more specifically the cinema establishments. A cinema was, well still is, able to bring together a community of movie enthusiasts and enable the minds in the room to escape the boundaries of reality. Films can influence. Films can inspire. Yet most profoundly, films can entertain. Tornatore's post-WWII Italian drama is an ode to the boundless possibilities of said medium, and as a reclusive cinephile who yearns to be ascended by these moving pictures, I gobbled this feature up quicker than munching on fresh carbonara. After receiving news of the death of his fatherly figure Alfredo, Salvatore reminisces about his childhood and how he discovered his infatuation with film.As predicted, considering this title won numerous awards between '89-'91, it's stuffed with tropes and sub-plots found in a variety of genres. Most worked in Tornatore's favour, the remaining few on the other hand proved to be a futile exercise in overloaded storytelling. Immediately what springs to mind, and has yet to abscond the empty void that is my brain, is Morricones' composition. Sensationally authentic, with subtle Italian flavours that truly encapsulated Sicilian aesthetics. The ambience, the atmosphere and the almighty sense of communal drive. It's what makes Cinema Paradiso so incredibly enticing. Fully complementing the heartfelt narrative style that Tornatore had lovingly produced.The plot is unwrapped through Salvatore's perspective, naturally a consequence of this is that his life story is the prominent development function for all characters. Aside from Alfredo, his war widow mother Maria and his childhood love interest Elena, other characters were mere background villagers that were implemented to enhance the overall lighthearted humour. It was a success. Purely shining the spotlight of Salvatore, and experiencing how films had moulded his life, was effective. The glisten in young Salvatore's eyes reminded me of when I received that very same sparkle. Watching my first film, overwhelmed by inspiration.Whilst Tornatore's intention was to celebrate this popular art form, the drama surrounding his characters also took precedent. For the most part, both elements were well balanced. The second act however, which I can only assume the theatrical cut was edited with a chainsaw, unfortunately lost momentum. Pivotal scenes felt abruptly removed, particularly the sweeping romanticism between Salvatore and Elena, and severely came across as underdeveloped. The romance, being a manifestation of everything that Salvatore had witnessed being a projectionist and having to splice out kissing scenes (more on that in a moment), had no time to truly simmer. Undercooked spaghetti of love, or something of that cuisine. Then randomly shoving in the compulsory military service montage, and the second act truly proved to be voided of purpose. I can only assume that the director's cut, with an additional fifty minutes of footage, resolves these issues.Fortunately, the concluding act kicks in and rounds off a sterling performance from Noiret who acts as the father figure for Salvatore. A much required dynamic that allowed some emotional connection between Alfredo and Salvatore. Only to the conclude on a whimsically melancholic note that is sure to make you empathise with Alfredo. Yes, the ""kissing scene montage"" as it's infamously referred as. Profusely removing comedy and pushing sentimentality forward. It's not particularly subtle, but Tornatore solidifies his sentiments of intertwining pragmatism with nostalgia. Closing this coming-of-age narrative with a celebratory tear.Cinema Paradiso is a reflection. A reminder if you will. That the age of cinema is far from dilapidated. A celebration of an art form that we, the general public, take for granted. And most importantly, it proves that film can inspire generations, shaping their lives for the better. My criticisms I suspect are mostly regarding the international cut of the film, but still need to be addressed. I'll be sure to give the director's cut a gander in the near future, in the hope that it only betters the story. For now, whilst it isn't the greatest export from Italy, it certainly is deserved of its unanimous praise. Even if the lighthearted nature downplays the dramatic elements.",Cinema Paradiso
41,SAMTHEBESTEST,"A cinematic paradise of memories, emotions and heart touching recall..",9,8 April 2020,"Short Review :-Watched Cinema Paradiso (1988)A nostalgia that will haunt me forever, i repeat forever. A cinematic paradise of memories, emotions and heart touching recall. One of the finest foreign language film i have ever came across after #LifeIsBeautiful (1997) which coincidentally happens to be from the same Italian industry. I gotta admire the storytelling of Italian directors, how simply and easily they managed to tug a ring in heart. Cinema Paradiso has an excellent story and the story-telling is even better i mean just speechless formula. The film gets going with an ease despite the fact that i am not listening to dialogues and trying to understand everything from the subtitles. And how smoothly it takes you on a journey of a cute little kid and his mentor, the cinema projectionist. There is a bonding of these two, then there's a lovestory which remains incomplete, well that is another haunting part but i just don't fall for romance so easily. Even after having the predictable climax director Guiseppe Tornatore still shows his genius mind with little little things which i believe, should be noticed by a movie buff. I am writing this review with tears in my eyes, well that tells so much about the film. This is straight forward going to my personal favorites list and strongly recommended for those with Hearts. A MASTERPIECE !

42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Nostalgia incarnate — a film that movie-lovers won't be able to help but love,9,28 October 2017,"Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Cinema Paradiso"" is one of those perfectly carved cinematic gems, at least in terms of structure and moving storytelling. The fact that it is perhaps the best film about nostalgia doesn't hurt either.In many ways, ""Cinema Paradiso"" is the unpretentious cousin once removed from Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2"" in that a filmmaker looks back on his childhood. Only Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) isn't a man of questionable integrity trying to make ""true art,"" but a man reuniting with the childhood he abandoned and rediscovering everything that shaped who he became.Tornatore crafts a vibrant post-war Italian village with a piazza full of an assortment of characters, at the center of which is a movie theater where young Salvatore, or ""Toto"" (Salvatore Cascio) fell in love with movies. The combination of authenticity and outright comedy result in an aesthetic that evokes childhood in the most universal sense, not just a childhood that those who grew up in Italy in the '40s and '50s will respond to. The characters and scenes are written like wistful memories that lock in to the nostalgia zone of our brains.The loving mentor relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), the movie theater projectionist, is the film's heartbeat, and it's fueled by the love of movies that Tornatore nurtures early and often. In one scene, we witness both the apex of that magic that speaks to why movies and movie theaters are so special, and also total heartache. It happens early in the film, but at that point, Tornatore has you like putty in his hands. The teenage Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) chapters get a little too caught up in a straightforward courtship narrative with town newcomer Elena (Agnese Nano), but the fairytale elements of this young love are meant to play as larger than life given the heavy nostalgia factor. It's not the most compelling element of the film, but there's such a lovable aura around ""Cinema Paradiso"" that the clichés go a much longer way than they would otherwise.By the time the film bounces back to adult Salvatore returning home, the fact that we know so little about Salvatore's life as an adult and filmmaker is irrelevant. We can so easily identify with ""going back home"" and certain feelings resurfacing that we don't even realize how invested we are in Salvatore seeing old places and people again. Tornatore then brilliantly slips in that Salvatore is a filmmaking — and a successful one at that — and it takes the couple hours that came before to a whole new level.""Cinema Paradiso"" is built on a foolproof storytelling model that has a timeless appeal. Tornatore demonstrates an understanding of not just personal nostalgia, but collective nostalgia, and he wields this knowledge — one of cinema's most powerful tools — as finely as any filmmaker has. As niche as a 1980's Italian film about growing up in Italy post-World War II may seem, it's this skill that makes Tornatore's person's experience seem as though it could have been any of ours. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

44,Anonymous_Maxine,"A celebration of what the movies were, are, and hopefully can be again.",10,11 May 2005,"From beginning to end, Cinema Paradiso is, of course, about various forms of love, but my favorite element of the story is not just the way movies are portrayed, but the way old movies are portrayed. I have a particular fondness of older films (and a particular distaste for the shallow, exploitative and unimaginative garbage constantly cranked out by Hollywood these days), and one of the biggest themes of this film is the loss of purity and truth and innocence that movies once had.Obviously, I'm not talking about the glory days when kissing scenes were edited out of the projected version of a film, but the days when even a film that had the kissing and even minor, minor nudity scenes cut out of them would still draw a frantic crowd so eager to see films that they would sit for 30 minutes waiting for the second half the begin. Today, audiences would be up and asking for refunds within five minutes, and if there was no sex or explosions or car chases in the movie, many of them wouldn't be there in the first place, which is truly sad and is exactly what this movie rails against.I particularly loved the scene where Toto finally goes back home when he learns about the death of Alfredo (which would have been a spoiler, except that you learn of Alfredo's death within the first five or ten minutes of the movie), and his mother tells him that just before he died, Alfredo asked her not to tell Toto, not to ask him to come back. In the next scene Toto is walking through the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso and sees how cruel time has been to it and, even worse, how cheap and derivative the movies have become that are now played there.Alfredo didn't want Toto to come back because he saw what movies were becoming, and that is a direct message to the film industry the likes of which has never been seen like this. Cinema Paradiso owns that message, and it's one of my favorite lessons about film history.",Cinema Paradiso
45,Vartiainen,The reason we love movies,8,19 March 2018,"Cinema Paradiso is the tale of a small Sicilian village in post-war Italy. It's the tale of a small boy named Toto, who lives in the village and befriends Alfredo, the projectionist of the local movie theater. In the cramped, messy confines of the projector room he falls in love with movies and the escape route they provide for him. The tale takes us on a journey throughout his childhood and early adulthood as we watch him grow up and learn more and more about the world outside of the silver screen. And yet the movies are always there.It's a good story, but the thing you'll fall in love are the movies and the way this movie talks about them. For it turns the camera around and shows us the audience. How they experience the movies, what they mean for them. What we experience, what they mean for us. And in this regard this being an Italian film is an enormous boon. For this audience lives these movies. They laugh, they cheer, they weep in tears as they recite the lines of dialogue they know better than the faces of their mothers. Living in Finland I've not seen anything like that in my life - we're a reserved people - but I've certainly felt all those emotions. I know them, even if I've never witnessed them outside the confines of my own head.Cinema Paradiso is a love letter to movies. To the darkness of the theater, to the white light of the projector, to the eternity contained on the silver screen. Sure, it also talks about how real life doesn't always turn out like it does in the movies, but that's also part of why we love them so much.To you, Toto. To you, Alfredo. Thank you.",Cinema Paradiso

The Projectist is an old man who tolerates his visits. Day after day the boy not only becomes a help to the old man, but soon develops a love for films, but learns to appreciates them throughout his life. His own life is filled with love with a young beauty and events which effect his town and it's people. As these events parade through his life and his family, he never loses his life for movies. Through each event his own life takes it's toll as we see him age, while he learns the value of love and friendship, plus the price each has on him. 'Alfredo,' The old man (Philipp Noriret) Gives the boy some advice which doesn't always pan out. Still the film garners many awards from around the world. Interesting enough it is rated R and after seeing the film twice I can't see why. There is nothing in the film which promotes all the objections such as overt nudity, sex or violence. And yet, the village priest see's to it that not even Kissing is allowed to be viewed by the audience. Never the less, it wins many awards and is worth keeping as a movie. The actors have given us a view of their lives and we can't see an reason why the family shouldn't see it as well. ***",Cinema Paradiso
47,ackstasis,"""Life isn't like in the movies. Life is much harder.""",8,18 July 2008,"Filmmakers often possess a deeper passion that is noticeably reflected in their work. However, there is one passion that all directors inevitably share, and that is for cinema itself. Films like Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)' and, more recently, Michel Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind (2008),' exhibit such affection towards movies and movie-making that no film-lover can help but like them. In 1988, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore released 'Nuovo cinema Paradiso / Cinema Paradiso,' his personal ode to the magic of movies and the humble small-town cinema. After a poor local performance, the film was sheered down to 123 minutes (from 155 minutes), and subsequently went on to win both the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar. In 2002, a 170-minute director's cut {marketed in the United States as 'Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'}, which restored all of the original future, was released into theatres. As the director's cut was the only version to which I had ready access, this was the one that I watched for the first time. The director's cut is notable in that it greatly expands on Alfred's role in Toto's life and career.In the hustle-and-bustle of modern Rome, acclaimed film director Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) returns home to a sad message from his elderly mother: ""Alfredo has died."" During the night, the man reflects on his childhood, when, as a bright and fervent young boy (played by Salvatore Cascio), he used to frequent his small town's local cinema, where the friendly projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) taught him, however reluctantly, the tricks of the trade. Flash forward several years, and Toto is now a mature and intelligent teenager, falling for the first (and only) time into the throes of young love. Though I have not seen the shortened theatrical version, from what I've been able to gather, the story doesn't delve too deeply into the adventures of the adult Toto. In the director's cut, most of the additional running time is dedicated to his home-town return, as he is drawn almost overwhelmingly into the regretful ghosts of his past. These sequences are, of course, not without interest, but Tornatore is at his strongest in the first act, with Toto as an impressionable young boy immersed in the joy of cinema.Philippe Noiret is wonderful as the warm and occasionally brusque film projectionist, and his interactions with Toto (especially young Salvatore Cascio) develop into a powerful father-son relationship. The director's cut intriguingly suggests that Alfred deliberately mislead Toto about Elena (Agnese Nano, later Brigitte Fossey) in order to preserve his chances of succeeding with his #1 love of all, movies. Alfred suspected that, had Toto married Elena, he would never have been able to become an accomplished film director  as a beloved father figure for the boy, he made the difficult decision that Toto could never have made. The ethical complications of Alfred's decision are problematic, but one can at least follow his logic, and his motives, however misguided, were certainly well-intended. At the film's end, as the adult Toto is doubting his love for cinema, his passion is reassured with a wonderful montage of the romantic moments that the town's prudish priest had once sliced from every film to be screened in his theatre. This is the magic of cinema. It's not just the films themselves, but also the flood of personal memories that accompanies each forbidden screen embrace.",Cinema Paradiso
48,mjneu59,mawkish sentimentality with a very mixed message,4,10 November 2010,"The 1988 Oscar winner for Best Foreign Film is, for all its incidental charm, every bit as mushy as the movies it celebrates, elevating a passion for movie-going in a small Sicilian village to a magical experience able to cure any distress, allowing even a blind man to 'see'. The mood of the film is warm and sentimental but its message is, at best, inconsistent: movies, it says, may be wonderful, but are no substitute for experience, and yet after reaching maturity the young protagonist spends thirty years in limbo before reclaiming his childhood innocence in the censored outtakes saved by his now deceased mentor, kindly old theater projectionist Philippe Noiret. Even worse: the films of his youth are presented as escapist daydreams, but his entire life (revealed in flashback from childhood to middle age) is no less an illusion, transformed by nostalgia into a heart tugging, romantic tearjerker. Life, it seems, not only imitates art, but often improves upon it, inadequate dubbing notwithstanding.",Cinema Paradiso

51,noralee,Director's Cut Changes the Entire Meaning of the Film - more about life than the movies,8,20 December 2005,"I didn't see the first cut of ""Cinema Paradiso (Nuovo cinema Paradiso)"" because everyone said it was a schmaltzy nostalgia tribute to growing up watching old movies in a small town that happened to be in Italy. This original director's cut changes such a description; it's now a full autobiographical take on an artist and what drove him from and back to Sicily. This cut restores 51 minutes that the distributor chopped off the end of the movie -- that's more than a third of the film. It now has more in common with ""Last Picture Show.""We now see the full sweep of post-war development in Sicily, as the town piazza slowly goes from a wide expanse with the occasional horse-drawn funeral cortège, to a car park. While what captivated audiences originally is still entertaining -- the precocious child actor who plays the artist as a smart-aleck small boy-- now we also see him as a love-struck teenager, soldier, young man with only existential choices and a gray-haired adult coming to terms with the people in his past.This original cut is essential because it provides clear-eyed re-interpretations of people we saw him with as a child; now we learn the truth about them through adult eyes. The director says he always intended it to be a love story, not just about the movies.Why did it take so long for this cut to appear? How could the director have tolerated such a massacre without screaming to the press? Contractual obligations? I saw the movie with a friend who has been exploring her Sicilian heritage; in 1995 she visited the town where the movie was shot and says it still looked like that then, and felt it was truthful to the people of the area.

52,rooprect,Kept getting distracted by my foot,1,2 November 2005,"I couldn't seem to focus on this stupid movie. I kept getting distracted by my foot (which proved to be immensely more entertaining). The music was sappy, the story was boring, and aside from one or two painfully obvious but weak jabs at political innuendo--not enough to form any substance but evidently enough to impress those predictable judges at the Cannes Film Festival--there was no theme at all.First let's talk music. Imagine the syrupy sweet drivel from a Hallmark greeting card commercial. Now repeat it for 2 hours. Now shoot yourself in the head. For 2 hours.Next let's talk about plot. It indeed has a plot, but not one worthy of 2 hours of your life. Unless you have no life. In which case, I repeat: shoot yourself in the head asap.Lastly, let's talk theme. Major strikeout. This film had so much potential; the metaphor of a lonely projectionist was brilliant. But instead of boldly proceeding with that challenging idea, the film spiralled into a morass of lukewarm humor, unconvincing romance and unconnected randomness. Fans of Virginia Woolf (stream-of-consciousness) may love this film. (But didn't Ms. Woolf end up shooting herself in the head?

54,3xHCCH,How Movies Influence Our Lives,9,12 January 2009,"I have heard of ""Cinema Paradiso"" for so long, but ironically I have not seen it yet. I am glad I finally got a chance to watch this Giuseppe Tornatore masterpiece on DVD.The story starts in the present time with Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita, an acclaimed film director, receiving news that a certain Alfredo has passed away. From there, the movie goes into flashback mode, and recounts Salvatore's life as a child and a teenager, and the lasting influence his surrogate father Alfredo had in his life.The first part of the flashback takes us back to Giancaldo in Sicily, and recounts how young Toto was so entranced with the movies being shown in the local movie house, the Cinema Paradiso. He constantly hung around Alfredo's (played by Phillip Noiret) projection room. Eventually, when Alfredo gets disabled in an accident, the child Toto took over the projectionist job.The second part of the flashback recounts the teenage Salvatore (played by Marco Leonardi) still doing his film projectionist job, while beginning his fledgling career as a movie maker. A lengthy part was devoted to his ill-fated obsession with the beautiful Elena. This unsuccessful love affair makes Salvatore take Alfredo's advice to leave Giancaldo and make something out of his life.In this Director's Cut DVD that I watched, another subplot was restored, which was cut out in the international release that won the Oscar Best Foreign Film back in 1988. This involved the older Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) going back to Giancaldo for Alfredo's funeral, and getting the chance to reunite the older Elena. This afforded a further revelation that gives another bittersweet dimension to the influence of Alfredo in Salvatore's life.Despite the 170-minute running time of the Director's Cut and the subtitles, Cinema Paradiso is indeed a modern classic that must be seem by everyone who loves the movies. The cinematography is lush and breathtaking. The Ennio Morricone score is very romantic, haunting and memorable. And the ending that shares with us the gift bequeathed by Alfredo to Salvatore after his death is very touching yet glorious at the same time.",Cinema Paradiso
55,EUyeshima,"Truly Affecting, Romanticized View of Cinema in a Sicilian Village",9,13 September 2007,"Before watching this on DVD just now, I had not seen director/screenwriter Giuseppe Tornatore's internationally renowned hit movie - at least the 123-minute version - since its initial 1990 release in the U.S., but I remember having mixed feelings that ran the gamut between being moved by its genuine poignancy and being resentful about what I felt at the time was its shameless heartstring tugging. Nearly two decades later, as I have gotten older and closer to the adult Salvatore's age, I have softened considerably in my opinion of the film, an open-hearted tribute to cinema and its transcendent impact on people's lives. Granted it is awash in sentimentality, but with its unique combination of storytelling elements inspired in equal parts by Chaplin and Fellini, there is a burnished, nostalgic glow to the whole venture as most of it is designed as a flashback.The plot begins with Salvatore ensconced in middle age as a successful film director based in Rome. Unexpectedly, he makes plans to return to his hometown in Sicily for the first time in almost thirty years. The reason is two-fold: the funeral of Alfredo, the projectionist who first introduced Salvatore to films, and the demolition of the Cinema Paradiso theater where they showed films to the enthusiastic denizens every Saturday night. This triggers memories of Salvatore's childhood at the old theater with Alfredo and then his adolescence and young adulthood when he falls in love with a beautiful local girl named Elena. In true Romeo and Juliet fashion, he is separated from his one true love by her disapproving father, a wealthy banker, and I have to admit this is the part of the film I still find a bit predictable with Tornatore's Baroque sense of romanticism in high gear. The scenes that really have enduring impact are those between the young, energetic Salvatore, nicknamed ""Toto"", and the surly but lovable Alfredo. Tornatore captures the magical bond between the two, including a tragic episode that forces them to reverse their roles in the projection room.Interestingly, the 174-minute version presented on the second disc of the 2006 two-DVD set fills in the blanks about Elena's fate. The older Salvatore is reunited with Elena and finds out the truth behind their separation. While I enjoyed and appreciated the longer director's cut, I feel overall the additional scenes don't add as much dimension to the story as the nearly three-hour running time warrants. I think my preference for the heartwarming Alfredo-Toto scenes gravitate me more toward the 123-minute version presented on the first disc. The central performances are memorable with the obvious standouts being Phillipe Noiret (Il Postino) as Alfredo and cherubic Salvatore Cascio as Toto. Looking like a Neapolitan Josh Hartnett, Marco Leonardi (Like Water for Chocolate) takes over as Toto and brings youthful, hormonally-driven fervor to the role, and Agnese Nano brings the requisite dreamy quality to Elena.As the older Salvatore, Jacques Perrin (Z, The Young Girls of Rochefort) bears so little resemblance to his younger counterparts that his performance feels somewhat removed. In the longer version, his performance resonates more, especially as he shares the screen with Brigitte Fossey (Forbidden Games) as the older Elena. The famous screening room ending is in both versions - the showing of Alfredo's gift to Salvatore, a reel of film clips highlighting kissing scenes excised by the local priest - though I find just as touching the theater demolition scene with the now-aged villagers looking on in a most resigned manner. Blasco Giurato's cinematography is stunning throughout, and enough cannot be said of Ennio Morricone's memorable music score, one of cinema's most beautiful in evoking the movies aura of romantic nostalgia.Beyond the director's cut of the movie, the 2006 Limited Collector's Edition DVD has several extras of note, the best being an informative, somewhat academic commentary track from Italian film historian Millicent Marcus interspersed with periodic personal recollections from Tornatore, as well as a fifteen-minute retrospective featurette, ""Exploring a Timeless Classic"". Of more anecdotal interest are a four-minute short on how Baltimore's Little Italy neighborhood has embraced the film with an annual outdoor showing encouraging more than a few romances; two theatrical trailers - the original and the director's cut released in 2002; and most inconsequentially, a Food Network show with Napa chef Michael Chiarello with recipes inspired by the movie.",Cinema Paradiso

We follow the boy through the years and the longer the movie takes the more we like him.The movie is beautiful and funny too. The best funny moments come from a priest (Leopoldo Triest). He watches every movie for the theater first and makes sure everything that is related to sex (even a sweet kiss) will be censored. He rings a little bell when the projectionist needs to cut that part from the film.Although the movie is long (the new version plays for 170 minutes) it is never boring.

'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' or simply 'Cinema Paradiso' is spellbinding and absolutely heart-wrenching that is indeed a must-watch for any and every cinephile who has wondered what greatness in the medium truly means - well, look no further!I continue to be moved and deeply touched by this beautiful film from Italy, and I never tire of watching it. It shares the lives of Toto and Alfredo. It is about Toto who is a small Sicilian boy who loses his father in the Second World War and the older man Alfredo who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make-believe, movies and adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his parallel existence.An emotional journey of relationships, it is iconic cinema of the finest level. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral.

The move to the earlier time in the chronology sets the story to settle in nicely, and having the scene go back to the present Toto helps brings back the audience to the present condition and tie up the story until the finale moment come.

I really like how the movie tells the story of a man since his childhood until his older days. The movie also nicely instates a patron character without instating the usual hard characteristics. The acting is nicely done, although a little bit hyperbolic at times. In overall, the acting was able to make the movie live out as a whole. It's only too bad that the romance isn't really finished in this movie.",Cinema Paradiso
64,richard-1787,A movie about being infatuated with movies,10,10 November 2017,"I first saw this movie back in 1988 in Italy, when it came out there. Back here in the States, I must have seen it several dozen times, in theaters and on VHS tape. It is not a ""feel good movie"" - thank God - but it always overwhelmed me emotionally.I saw it again tonight on TCM, for the first time in 20-some years, and found that I still remembered many of the lines. I almost always knew what was coming next, what would be said next.And I found that I still find it profoundly moving. It is the story of a man who grows up in love with two people, the projectionist at the movie theater in his small Sicilian town, and later, a beautiful young woman who arrives for a few years in his town and then leaves. Both, in different ways, leave him searching for love in a very idealized form, a form that he cannot, for obvious reasons, find in his adult life. And so he goes from one empty relationship to another, all the while making what are evidently very successful movies, though we never find out what they are about. When he comes back to his small town, after having been away many years, he sees how small-town life in rural Italy has changed. But he does not really seem to learn how his fascination with romantic movies has impeded his own emotional development.That sounds very dour, which this movie is not. It is, in fact, a warm-hearted and wonderful film about life in small-town Italy after World War II. I cannot recommend it too highly. It is one of the most profoundly moving films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.A note: the 124-minute version shown on TCM tonight, which is the version I saw many times here in the States in theaters and on VHS, is substantially shorter than the original Italian version, which was at one point released in this country as the ""director's cut."" I haven't seen that in years, but as I recall, it made certain scenes in the movie more understandable. It's worth searching out, as I recall, but I will admit that I found parts of it too slow.",Cinema Paradiso

Since his childhood, Toto was fascinated by the movies and spent countless hours in the projection booth with Alfredo who had become the boy's friend and the mentor. After a fire blinds Alfredo, Toto becomes the projectionist, and the Cinema Paradiso continues to attract all villagers and to bring them together on Friday night to experience again and again the miracle of film. The boy's obsession with film becomes a lifelong love affair which will make him eventually a famous and successful filmmaker.Deceivingly simple and straightforward, the film is always moving, tender, touching, full of humor, love and compassion to its eccentric characters but what makes is special and unique, is the fact that we the viewers, all of us can and do relate to the story because we relive our own childhood movie experiences while watching the film. My memory took me many years and thousands miles back to the time when I was 5 and my grandmother took me to the theater for the first time. She later told me that she had been afraid that I would've became bored, restless, and started to cry - it never happened. I was so charmed and fascinated by what was happening on the huge screen that I sat not even moving, mesmerized and not uttering the single sound. Since that very moment, I have been always ready for the miracle to happen again. I expect every new movie to be great; I want to love, to cherish and to adore it. When it happens and the movie becomes mine, I am the happiest person in the Universe. It did happen tonight when I was watching Giuseppe Tarnatore's ""Cinema Paradiso"", one of the best films about the power, beauty, and magic of FILM ever made.",Cinema Paradiso
66,Luigi Di Pilla,Very original,7,6 March 2005,If you like a story without action or bum-bum and love nostalgic/romantic movies this is one for you. There are lot of emotional scenes with lot of humor and a little love story. The music was so fine that takes your breath away and it is well tuned to each scene. Director Giuseppe Tornatore created a nice Italian and original story about a typical cinema in the 40/50ies that was located in South Italy. The little boy and Philippe Noiret did a great job here but every actor made a solid casting. Sometimes I had some nostalgic thoughts about my own country. The rating on IMDb with actually 8.3 is okay and not overrated. There was no doubt that it won the Oscar for the best foreign movie and also for many other international awards. My vote with my wife is 7/10. Go and see it.,Cinema Paradiso
67,Takethispunch,Good one.,10,10 July 2016,"In Rome, in the 1980s, famous Italian film director Salvatore Di Vita returns home late one evening, where his girlfriend sleepily tells him that his mother called to say someone named Alfredo has died. Salvatore obviously shies from committed relationships and has not been to his home village of Giancaldo, Sicily in 30 years. As his girlfriend asks him who Alfredo is, Salvatore flashes back to his childhood.It is a few years after World War II. Six-year-old Salvatore is the mischievous, intelligent son of a war widow. Nicknamed Toto, he discovers a love for films and spends every free moment at the movie house Cinema Paradiso. Although they initially start off on tense terms, he develops a friendship with the fatherly projectionist, Alfredo, who takes a shine to the young boy and often lets him watch movies from the projection booth. During the shows, the audience can be heard booing when there are missing sections, causing the films to suddenly jump, bypassing a critical romantic kiss or embrace. The local priest had ordered these sections censored, and the deleted scenes are piled on the projection room floor. At first, Alfredo considers Toto a bit of a pest, but eventually he teaches Salvatore to operate the film projector.The montage ends as the movie house catches fire (highly flammable nitrate film was in routine use at the time) as Alfredo was projecting The Firemen of Viggiù after hours, on the wall of a nearby house. Salvatore saves Alfredo's life, but not before some film reels explode in Alfredo's face, leaving him permanently blind. The Cinema Paradiso is rebuilt by a town citizen, Ciccio, who invests his football lottery winnings. Salvatore, yet a child, is hired as the new projectionist, as he is the only person who knows how to run the machines.About a decade later, Salvatore, now in high school, is still operating the projector at the Cinema Paradiso. His relationship with the blind Alfredo has strengthened, and Salvatore often looks to him for help — advice that Alfredo often dispenses by quoting classic films. Salvatore has been experimenting with film, using a home movie camera, and he has met, and captured on film, Elena, daughter of a wealthy banker. Salvatore woos — and wins — Elena's heart, only to lose her due to her father's disapproval.",Cinema Paradiso
68,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A love-letter to cinema as a force of artistic nature.,10,29 August 2020,"Cinema Paradiso is concentrated proof that Italy's love for cinema is not only passion for an art form, but a way of life that's transformative in the best possible ways and can can change the human heart for the better. This film is a fantastic trip into the world of 35mm cinema and its rippling effects throughout Europe post-World-War-Two.It's a great slice of 1980s cinema that you'd expect Hollywood to have remade a dozens times by now: thankfully this is not the case here and this movie is an experience that remains untainted by America's 'remake syndrome'. It's a love story about a little Italian town and it's theatre: the Cinema Paradiso. And like the films they watch the audience themselves all have their own stories to tell. It all centres around Alfredo's movie theatre and his raising of Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita through the magic of movies via 35mm-cinema projection.It's a coming-of-age story about cinema's wisdom and charm rather than the cynicism of the film industry: it's got a heart-warning vibe to it throughout its two-hour+ runtime (depending on whether you've seen the theatrical, or the near-three-hour extended, cut of the movie) and it's one any self-professed cinephile MUST watch!It's an example of European cinema that's artistically expressive and surprisingly accessible to more mainstream audiences. It's a zeitgeist movie of the 80s. 5/5 stars.",Cinema Paradiso
69,KnightsofNi11,"Touching, moving, uplifting",8,28 September 2011,"Some movies we just can't help but fall in love with. Such is the case of Cinema Paradiso, the touching story about a boy growing up in Sicilly and how his life is influenced by the cinema in his small rural town. This boy, Toto, builds a deep friendship with the cinema's projectionist, Alfredo. The film begins with Toto as a grown man, now a successful filmmaker, reflecting on his childhood and the things that influenced him in order to get him where he is today. This is one of those movies that is truly beautiful. It is so moving, so powerful, and, like I already said, one can't help but fall in love with it.Cinema Paradiso is the kind of film that seems simple enough on the outside. It is a film about a boy growing up. But the film weaves so many things into this boy's life and we grow a strong connection to him and the people around him. We develop a deep understanding of all the characters in this film and what roles they play in Toto's life and how they all change and grow along with Toto. The relationship that builds between Toto and Alfredo is one of the most compelling and touching tales of human compassion you'll ever find. It molds Cinema Paradiso into a bold and beautiful film with such a strong heart and powerful mind.This is one of those films that moves along with such grace and such delightful ease that your love for the film only grows as the characters grow. It is a wonderfully paced and exquisitely scripted film that moves along at a light hearted pace, never faltering and never becoming stale or redundant. It is a consistently moving tale of human emotion and connection that hearkens back to a simpler time of cinema, a time filled with more grace, love, and compassion towards human beings. I feel that this is a film that resents the gritty violent world of cinema that today's generation has created. Cinema Paradiso is a film about love. It is one that casts out hate and stifles modern cinema's dark disposition. I personally don't take Cinema Paradiso's side because I love dark and gritty films, but I still respect this film for the high quality piece of art that it most certainly is.It's not to say that Cinema Paradiso is all flowers and rainbows. It certainly has a side to it that isn't necessarily dark, just realistic. It deals with the simple facts of life that tragedies occur and people die. You can't avoid these things and Cinema Paradiso isn't a disillusioned film that thinks the world is all fun and games. And that relates back to how human of a film Cinema Paradiso is. It is an incredibly moving story that doesn't find it necessary to be melodramatic. It is dramatic, of course, but in such a way that highlights its beauty and brings out all the positive qualities of this film's story. It is a truly excellent film. Even if it isn't your cup of tea you can't say that you don't realize the beauty and artistic quality of this fine film.",Cinema Paradiso

The film is often credited for reviving Italy's film industry which later produced Mediterraneo (1991) and Life Is Beautiful (1997).Cinema Paradiso is an affectionate, nostalgic film that trades on its love for cinema, and particularly for cinema-going in a bygone era. It's effective as a rites-of-passage piece, as an affable study of village characters, and later, in a melancholy aside, as a reminder that fame and success can make one's emotional life more complicated than films often suggest.",Cinema Paradiso
71,cultfilmfan,Cinema Paradiso,7,21 November 2005,"Cinema Paradiso, is an Italian film but I was able to see a dubbed copy of it in English whereas it is originally in Italian. The film is set in Italy in the early years of cinema. It is about a young boy named Salvatore (who is nicknamed Toto) who daily goes to the theaters to watch movies. He becomes friends with the projectionist named Alfredo. The two of them bond and Alfredo teaches Salvatore about film and how to use the projector and the film shows their friendship and Salvatore's life and how he grows up and the impact film and Alfredo has had on him.

Before I start my review let me say that the version I saw of the film was the original version running at 121 minutes. A year or two ago a new version was released with extra footage that runs about 174 minutes. One of the reasons I saw Cinema Paradiso was because I always read good things about it and it is often talked and praised about on different movie sites and message boards. Another reason that I saw this film was when I was in a small independent video store once that carried a lot of foreign, independent and offbeat films. I saw this film on the shelf and on the corner there was a note from one of the workers of the store that said something like ""This is the reason I opened this store"". After reading many good reviews and after reading this note I decided to see the film. Cinema Paradiso has good direction, a good script, good performances from the two main actors and a good supporting cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing and good production design. The film is a good looking film and it is sweet and touching. The film has a nice story and nice characters that you begin to care about and you want to see how the film progresses and what happens to them. This is a film that I think people young and old will enjoy because it is a coming of age story and it will appeal to many. The film is well made and is just generally a well done feel good movie that hits all the right notes.",Cinema Paradiso

73,Atreyu_II,"First half is great, but that's it",7,13 August 2010,"This Italian motion picture achieved notorious fame, comparable to the equally famous and more recent Italian movie 'La Vita è Bella'.Like that one, this one is also very good in its first half, but after that it becomes a movie of bad taste. That's really too bad, because this movie (and 'La Vita à Bella') had potential to be something big.'Nuovo Cinema Paradiso' can be considered a homage both to cinema and films. It shows us the pinnacle of the cinema as an industry of entertainment and as an escape for those who go there to watch the movies, making them forget the hard reality of poverty and war. Besides the cinema's success, it also shows its progress, its bankrupt, its decadence and its sad ending.This is a very simple film. However, simplicity doesn't necessary mean something bad. Plus, the brilliant and memorable soundtrack by Ennio Morricone adds lots of emotion to the film, particularly in its first half, which is without a doubt the best part of the movie.One of the biggest charms of this movie is the fascination and enthusiasm of Salvatore (whose nickname is ""Toto"") on the cinema and the projectionist job. He wins the friendship of the local projectionist, Alfredo, who also teaches him all about that job. As you can tell, ""Toto"" is a very intelligent kid and a very quick learner. Plus, he is mischievous, cute and hilarious.Of course, even the first half has its minor faults, such as the pranks of bad taste - for example, that pig who spits to the audience and the prank with a bug on the sleepy guy. Pranks aside, I also don't like at times the behavior of Salvatore's mother: she slaps him a number of times.As for the good of the first half, well, just about most of it. And this without forgetting Salvatore's dumb classmate. He's a poor dumb kid who doesn't know what 5x5 is. Whenever he answers that question is hilarious, as each answer is dumber than the previous one. In the 3rd time, he goes as far as replying «Natale!» (which is ""Christmas"" in Italian) - when he said that, I practically died of laughter!As for the 2nd half of the movie, most of it is wrong and seems quite rushed and forced. Salvatore is no longer charming as a grown up. The love story between Salvatore and the girl of his dreams is frustrating in all ways, not to mention that it's ridiculous that Salvatore spends entire months waiting for her to open the window as a sign that she fell in love for him. There is no comedy or charm as in the 1st half. An animal is stabbed. Salvatore joins the army. And Alfredo's attitude later is puzzling: forcing Salvatore to leave that town forever, never look back, never return (not even to visit, going as far as saying that if he returns he won't receive him in his house), never let nostalgia hit him and never to even write or think about them.I clearly prefer ""Toto"" as a child than as a teen or as an adult. ""Toto"" is far more charming as a child. In fact, the moment he grows up, for some reason the movie looses its initial greatness.Phillipe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo, but little Salvatore Cascio steals the show as little ""Toto"".I never saw the Director's Cut version. And frankly, I've got no interest in watching it. It's about 30 minutes longer, making it a too long movie and it certainly makes one view the film differently, as many of the mysteries are revealed (which might not be a very good idea). I saw the shorter version which isn't even that short, as it is nearly 2 hours long. But I can handle a movie of 2 hours.",Cinema Paradiso
74,Pedro_H,Nothing short of an all-time classic - a cinema milestone.,8,1 October 2004,"The story of the life and times of a small Italian community told through the eyes of a cinema-loving boy destined to be a film famous director.There are film reviews where you say all you want to say in three paragraphs and there are film reviews that you could write about a thousand paragraphs and not get everything in. This film belongs in the later category but, ironically, I'll keep it short!This is a great viewing experience because it is - for me - why cinema is a great art form. All the art forms coming together to deliver something that is more than the sum of its parts. You are taken to a time and place that you never were (in most cases anyway!), and given it has now gone, cannot possibly go to. This film takes you there and lets you sample it, taste it and believe it - before the lights go up and your real life returns.""Great cinema"" is rare and often somewhat disappointing. For example, The Godfather is uneven and immoral (the first one anyway) and while the Shawshank Redemption and Se7en are great, they only warrant one viewing unless you actually bought the thing. Even in the IMDb Top 100 there are films that are little more than video games. Maybe have too many little clichés: Happy couple running through the fields, moments of happiness underlined by tears (and background violins), the scarifies done for the (perceived) greater good, people growing old together, the innocent past being superior to the corrupted present. All be done with panache, but you know they are cribs from other people's work.Maybe the confusing romance (there is a hole that the director's cut claims to fill) was an effort to steer away from the tried-and-trusted. Hard to say anything about it without being a spoiler though. Thankfully it puts something back in to pot with the finale that is as original and brilliant as anything I have ever seen! I won't spoil it - but a real leap of the imagination. While we see the man/boy relationship as being key to the opening scenes of the film, I couldn't get totally inside it. You respect older people because you think that they ""know something"" when you find that they don't your relationship changes. Equally film directors tend to be from a certain background or have a natural authority about them - the leap from being up able to project a film to being able to make one is large. And not as obvious as portrayed here.What knocks this down from a classic to a minor classic is sentimentally. Olivier said that you have to disguise your technique and he hadn't done it well enough at times. This is also true here. This wants your tears and emotions, but at the same time I can see the wheels going round and know how the trick works.There are harder hearts than mine to break, but a bit more solid and even plot and little bit less emoting (not all of it totally reasoned) would have delivered a better product. Nonetheless a very happy memory and a film worthy of the IMDb Top 100. Lets hope it stays there.Review is for the original cinema version, not the directors cut.",Cinema Paradiso

It's only one of many fantastic characteristics that tie this whole thing together.""Cinema Paradiso"" seems like such a simple story, but nothing about the questions it asks about fate, love and friendship are simple.And that's what I really love about this story. It's realistic, heartbreaking, and uplifting all at the same time. The audience mimics the characters here. There are many things that you would like to change. How many times have you asked yourself if you would do it differently if you had it all over to do again? Could you? No. It's the way it happened. It's life. You can only piece together the moments of joy and happiness and reflect... hope.what a fantastic film!You'll like this if you liked: A Very Long Engagement(not quite as excellent), Hugo(a clear notch below and it borrowed a ton from this), or Cast Away(not as good, very similar themes in both films' last 30 min).this review is of the 3hr director's cut, not the theatrical release... I couldn't imagine it any other way. Will view it though.Late Edit(after viewing the shorter, original theatrical version): IMO.. the extended cut is far more powerful. The love story and the journey of the lead character is more complete, and ultimately, I find the extended cut to be much better. That's the version I would recommend to the first time viewer - although I seem to be in the minority on this subject.",Cinema Paradiso

Seeing it over 30 years later didn't have quite the same effect but it was very much worth seeing again. Also not sure what version I saw on TCM in 2021 but it seemed much the same.The friendship between Alfredo, a film projectionist doing a job he loves, and Toto, a child with a burning desire to learn his trade, must rank as one of the most heart-warming Italian films. This is quite different than the 1940's and 50's post-war realist movies that Italy is famous for as it warms rather than breaks your heart. It also shows the raw emotions that are released when a man revisits his childhood.As the movie fast forwards to adulthood, we see Toto the man is living the good life. He is a movie director who has made the grade. When his mother calls to tell him of Alfredo's death, there is some question as to whether he will return for the funeral. His life has changed. No longer does he live in a Southern Italian village but in Rome, the nation's ancient and cosmopolitan capital. He has wealth, women and good looks. Going back home represents another time and place and not something he relishes. When he does return, he is admonished by his mother who feels he is not happy and needs to settle down with the right woman. She is very grateful for his generosity which has helped her materially but now her one wish is for him to be happy.The adult Toto takes part in the funeral, walking with the aged villagers who remember him as a child. He greets, giving handshakes and kisses but sadly, the village no longer resonates with life and the old theatre of his childhood is soon to be torn down. While in the projection booth of the theatre, he finds a surprisingly joyful reel of film that highlights moments in cinematic history put together by his old friend. What his life holds afterwards we don't know but the experience of going back home has clearly registered with him. I'm sure it also registers with viewers of this wonderful movie.",Cinema Paradiso

That being said, The earliest parts of the movie are the most magical, and you won't appreciate the first act unless you watch the reach the end of the movie.The second and the third act are less magical, and not very original, but they are narratively stronger than the first, and have wonderful messages presented by fantastic performances from Marco Leonardi, as Teenager Totò, and Jacques Perrin, as Adult Totò. Also, Philippe Noiret's performance as Alfredo is one of the most poignant, and iconic performances in film! Ennio Morricone's score will hit you right in the feels, it's his best, IMO.You'll get nostalgic feeling only from the movie.

A primary thread portrays the rise and fall of the movie theater as a popular cultural institution. Cinemas have been successively shuttering since the advent of first videotapes, then DVDs, and more recently home cinemas and binge television services. The romance and the coming of age stories are well-done as well, but my main interest is in Cinema Paradiso as a history of the movies. This one is set in Sicily, which makes it especially enticing.I feel that the three different major plotlines are woven together very well. My only complaints are that I do not like the accompanying music, which is often too schmaltzy for my tastes, and I also do not like the abrupt transformation in appearance of the main protagonist from a dark and sultry, thick-nosed, large-eyed, Latino to a thin-lipped, pointy-noised, beady-eyed light-haired fellow who seems closer to Scandinavian than Italian. I imagine that it is difficult to cast these transitions, but surely there was someone a bit closer in appearance to the unforgettable fellow whom we all saw in a similarly romantic role in Como Agua Para Chocolate?",Cinema Paradiso

They can enjoy a flick that has great costuming, great acting, and a wonderful score, even if the plot is boring and the characters unlikeable. Like The Piano (1993).The Cinema Paradiso is like this. There's no real plot; basically we follow the life of a boy who becomes a man. There are endless slow-moving scenes of how much he loves movies. It can throw you into a real funk. And the ending doesn't resolve the biggest mystery of the film. I won't spoil it for you but it involves romance.Who should see this film:-- Anyone who liked Forrest Gump, a film I personally loathed-- Arty film types, you have a real racket going in making the rest of us feel inferior for wanting our movies to have plot, pacing, conflict.I'll give Cinema Paradiso a surprisingly low 5 out of 10.

Mostly set in the town of Giancaldo, Sicily, the film centers around young Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita, who along with much of the town finds his escapism at the Cinema Paradiso movie house. After his curiosity gets peeked, projectionist Alfredo aids the young boy in his love for film by showing him how to run the projector. Upon growing up, Salvatore falls in love with a beautiful girl named Elena, causing Alfredo to get Salvatore to leave his town and pursue his true passion: filmmaking.Seeing the town of Giancaldo watching movies on the big screen is both heartwarming and hysterical, whether it'd be a fun and action filled western, a hilarious Charlie Chaplin comedy or even a tear-jerking romance. The mere reactions from the town provide a lot of humor and pathos and we really get to know all the important figures that live there. The bond between the imaginative Salvatore and the lovable curmudgeon Alfredo is quite touching, and their admiration of movies is what makes the heart of the movie prosper, especially when Alfredo tells Salvatore to live his own life and not follow in his footsteps.As for the romance between Salvatore and Elena, it's genuinely sweet given how determined Salvatore feels for her. However, rather than Elena simply overthrowing the plot, she helps it move forward, making it all the more believable and heart wrenching when Salvatore is told to move on. It's funny how Cinema Paradiso has become famous for its montage of forbidden kisses (thanks Father Adelfio), when arguably some of moviedom's greatest love scenes come from Salvatore and Elena embracing (watch the director's cut for more beauteous wonder).As stated before, the screenplay is quite humourous, mainly from how ludicrous the townsfolk can be with their undying love of cinema. However, the film can also get quite emotional, mainly from how we see the struggles of every character, even down to the censor demanding priest showing his moments of softness. Lastly, Ennio Morricone's scores truly shine as some of the greatest pieces of movie music history due to their upbeat tones and whimsical harmony. Needless to say, Cinema Paradiso is one of those films that has so much optimism and idealism that anybody can watch it and get sucked in; it truly is a phenomenal masterpiece that has been beloved for 30 years, and many more to come.",Cinema Paradiso
84,braddugg,Passion exuberance in every frame of the film. A rarity and a great tribute to cinema itself.,10,7 September 2014,"Passion exuberance in every frame of the film. A rarity and a great tribute to cinema itself.When love, passion and intelligence come together a genius is made and precisely Cinema Paradiso is that. Giuseppe Tornatore is a genius too. This is just his second feature film and he does an exemplary job. The nuances of a child from helping friends to learning things, growing up as juvenile and falling in love, then as a man who does his own thing. The life of a person is shown beautifully with wonderful fine moments. I love the scene in which Alfredo tells him not to trust a blue-eyed woman and how he uses a dialog from an old film is wonderful. From Keaton to Chaplin to Clark Gable to many more. There are wonderful references. The aficionados will love this as there are many montages of the good old films. The genius lies in a scene where the frame of the pass through the walls of the projection room and the film is showed on a wall of a street. Wonderful thing that and hats off to the writer director Tornatore for that.I must specially mention Ennio Morricone and his score. What music does, we all know it adds up life in a bland moment. It adds emotions, it reflects emotions, it fills silences. Ennio Moricone does it all and more he adds life to movie itself and how much ever I praise Morricone, it would be less by all means.The acting is fine be it of Alfredo, the projectionist played by Philippe Noiret, Salvatore Di Vita (child) played by Salvatore Cascio or a host of others. The boy and Alfredo have a charming chemistry which is wonderful, it gives a smile and at times there are feelings echoed my own of the way I respected my childhood teachers.A word about Giuseppe Tornatore, he really knows how to show kids and adolescents in the film. The earlier film I watched of his, Malena too had shown adolescent feelings wonderfully and here too, he knows how wonderful a kid can be and precisely depicts that with even more sensitivity. Kudos to him for that and I shall be indebted for him in many ways to have made two of my favorite films. This one and Malena.To all the film lovers, this is a must watch film and one of those that you must surely watch before I pass away. I am lucky to watch this and wish there shall be many more lucky ones. A 5/5 for this, one of the greatest films ever.",Cinema Paradiso
85,PIST-OFF,Wished I'd seen this when I was younger.,9,14 March 2021,"This movie is wonderful. It really captures a sense of nostalgia many of us harbor in our own lives. I don't know why I put off seeing it for so long. A little boy grows up loving movies (movie people in their narcissism love movies about movies) and is mentored by an older guy who sees big things in the kid's future. A rose tinted view of youth, love, and times that never seem to stop changing is what follows and a wonderful story it makes for. One of the few movies to get a grasp on childhood along with Stand By Me, The Sandlot, and a few others. Another movie that could benefit greatly from an English dub, as too many people are too likely to avoid subtitles at all costs.",Cinema Paradiso
86,Java_Joe,For the love of film.,9,23 July 2019,"Anybody that considers themselves a lover of movies needs to see this. It's one of the most beautiful love letters to movies themselves.Movies have the ability to move us. To touch us. To let us escape our reality. They entertain. They make us cry. And they open up new vistas that we might never once have seen. All those are ""Cinema Paradiso"".The story is the life of one Salvatore, a famous director who grew up in a small town in Sicily. Once night he comes home and his girlfriend tells him that somebody named Alfredo has died. The story is then told as a flashback telling us who Alfredo was and what his connection to Salvatore is.Six year old Salvatore loved movies and would spend all his time at the only movie theater in his village namely, Cinema Paradiso. Alfredo was the projectionist who mentored Salvatore and taught him everything he knew about movies. All the movies shown had to be screened for the local priest first so that he could order any scenes of kissing or impropriety to be removed. These little bits of film were then cut out by Alfredo and he had quite a collection of them because he never spliced them back into the movie. This plays a part later on near the end in a great little montage.This isn't a fast movie with explosions, car chases or really expensive set pieces. It's a character drama showing how young Salvatore went from being a small child with a love of movies to a great director and the things he had to give up to get there.It's a heartwarming tale of the tragedies and triumphs that shape our lives and should be required viewing for anybody looking for a character piece with a lot of heart.",Cinema Paradiso
87,MikeyB1793,Collapses in the second half,5,23 January 2013,"The Good:Let us start positively –little Salvatore (played by Salvatore Casio) is wonderful. His interaction with all the characters – particularly with the projectionist - is something to behold. He is an impish child and keeps us enthralled. This constitutes the first half of the film. It is also a tribute to the world of cinematography – the wonders of the movie. Everybody loves to be held captive by a movie. That about sums up the best part of this filmNot So Good:However Salvatore's later reincarnations as a young teenager and a ""successful"" adult are completely uninspiring and totally un-engaging. These reincarnations hardly represent the young lad that we saw previously who was bubbling over with energy.There is a romance theme with the teenage boy that is merely a rehash of the standard boy meets girl and gets jilted. This has been done I don't know how many times. It's cloying. What is also cloying and over- extended is when he returns in his adult incarnation back to his native village for the funeral of the projectionist. At this point the film just wilts like a dead flower – all the joyousness has dried up.There is suppose to be an even longer version of this at 170 minutes; I found the 2 hour version much too long (as in its time to fast-forward). For whatever reason, this film – in my opinion – is highly over-rated on IMD.",Cinema Paradiso

89,JakeBrinkman,Squandered potential,3,31 December 2018,"This movie started off very interesting as a view into cinemas of the past. The movie began on track to be entertaining, informative, well crafted, and presenting the writer's intended message. This should have shown the boy's love for the cinema, taking it over, and watching it slowly decline in popularity.However, halfway through the film, the plot takes a 90 degree turn and suddenly becomes a painstakingly generic romance movie. For no apparent reason, it completely abandons all of the buildup that was made in the first half and turns extremely bland.Usually movies with no purpose and direction receive a lower rating from me, but the only reason I have rated this so highly at a 3 is solely because the setup was good.

I wanted it to validate my own love of escapism, so wonderfully woven by incredibly directors who take us to such wonderful places that even our imagination couldn't have dreamed of. With such a grandiose name, the (lack of) family, village square, theater and boorish patrons fell short of endearing and, at times, fell short on many levels. Meaningful bits went on too long carried to 1970's made for TV levels by a overindulgent soundtrack. The actors played their parts, but with such inconsistent overdubbing, I felt for none of them. Yes the boy and projectionist bit was sweet, but not enough to carry the film. The older Totos' added no depth to the little boy. Conceptually nice and the scenes reenacting the crowds reaction to the theater and its limitations worked even if they were crude, but did we find a way to connect to movies as a character. I don't believe it was introduced until the final scene evidenced the character shunned from them by the church and I just couldn't relate, just like the film",Cinema Paradiso

Quite simply a movie you just must see.  Don't let the Italian dialogue scare you away. It adds to the charm already so inherent in this wonderful masterpiece of story-telling.Here is the deceptively simple plot:  Boy loves movies, Boy idolizes old man, Boy loves girl, Boy leaves home, Boy returns.Oh, but what happens in between those lines will leave your heart captivated for a long time.  Let me not leave Morricone's finest musical score.  The music will remain in your mind and heart long after - if you heart it again - the entire movie comes back to you and dare I say - you will cry once more at the poignancy of this movie.The last scene has been called many things - but as far as I am concerned - that last scene is the most touching ending I have seen in many a year.

95,WhimsicalVonia,"An amazing, thought-provoking, deeply-insightful, emotionally-riveting winner!",9,25 August 2013,"Well. Wow. Let me absorb this all for a moment. Alright. So that was... one of the best films I have seen in who knows how long. It is definitely on my all-time favorites list. Such an amazing film about film... but so, so much more. It is about friendships- the very best two people can share. The multitude of ways one person, one place, one passion can change your life for eternity; without which you would be a different person altogether. This film makes me want to experience the small town life that I never have, in any way before- to have so many people who know you so well; who grew up with you or watched you grow up; who can be proud of everything you have become; who love you in ways people who have not known you since you were a baby; A place where you can return decades later to find that everything has been the same after all these years, yet, at the same time, changed. This film inspires in me a love of films than span lifetime(s) in a way that very few others have. This film makes me think about so many things: redemption, regret, love, hope, friendships, trust, appreciation; how clinging to the past can be such a rewardingly bad tendency, how so many things we have no power over are so blatantly unfair, how, in the name of love, the most difficult decisions are inevitable made. I would kill to have a friendship like Toto & 's. I am regrettably obligated to clarify that, however. Alfredo's decision regarding Toto & Elena made me so upset that... I didn't know whether I could like his character anymore. His decision and actions were out of place, mean, and wrong. In the end, though, I suppose I can only say I respect Alfredo less, as I know, in his heart, he wanted what he felt was best for Toto. I emphasize, what he felt. And that's my point exactly. Because it was not his place and therefore not his right to do what he did- his sincere care and love for Toto irrelevant in this case- although mitigating the severity of his wrong. I agree that in some ways what evolved was best for Toto- but for his career. And I am an adamant believer that love is always the No. One priority in these lives of ours. At the end of the day, financial woes, careers, daily nuisances aside, love is what matters at the end of the day; at the end of a lifetime. Toto shares this philosophy, as made obvious several times. Secondly, why in heaven's name didn't the two of them rekindle their rare, genuine love at the end? I understand that some things in life can become too late t retrieve, but, again, I agree with Toto- they should have resumed it. I know neither of them ever loved anyone else, vows or not, anywhere near as powerfully. And, despite what I may say, contrary to all logic, I wish for a love like Toto & Elena's. As the saying goes, ""It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all."" I understand that times were different then, but, perhaps unfairly, I am upset with Elena. For not choosing true love over her family's unreasonable demands (although she did redeem herself). For not agreeing to set things right at the end. The only other issue I have is with the plausibility of some specific details. First, falling in love without ever talking, at first sight? And then Elena reciprocating, but, almost even more unbelievably, only after watching him wait outside her place for a year? Secondly, Toto's devotion to waiting outside is as unbelievable as the ""soldier's"" to the princess. Men like that could and would not ever exist. I would have identified so much more had it been more realistic. ""Of course I remember you..."" ""Life is not what you see in films... Life is much harder."" Amen to that. So extremely, heart-breakingly sadly.",Cinema Paradiso
96,mmallon4,The Ultimate Movie Lovers' Movie,10,20 October 2014,"Cinema Paradiso perfectly captures the obsessive and domineering power cinema has over its dedicated fans and their lives. Just like how our main child protagonist Toto becomes enchanted and engulfed by the movies, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which succeeds in doing just that. Cinema Paradiso takes the viewer back to a time when the movie theatre was at the heart of the community (where people would even jerk it and have sex in the middle of a crowded theater?! - Must be a European thing). Cinema Paradiso is my favourite foreign language film and what a rich experience it is. The music, scenery and vibrant architecture of Sicily immediately draw me in (man, Italians are so over the top) - I simply enjoy the essence of being there and I'd happily watch the movie without the subtitles on.The movie follows the relationship between Toto and his Freudian father figure Alfredo, a projectionist at the local cinema. Alfredo himself is very much a mythical character; he has no back-story or even a surname, yet he succeeds in being one of the most unforgettable characters in film history. He is a man who appears to have never made much for himself in life; ultimately a bit of a loser. This is one aspect of the story which really punches me in the gut; Alfredo prevents Toto from going down the same road as he did but as the cost of never having to see him again. It works and especially in the director's cut in which we learn Toto has become a famous filmmaker - wouldn't we all want an Alfredo in our lives?Did I mention Cinema Paradiso is the saddest movie of all time - fact. I recommend wearing a life jacket while watching this movie or you will drown in your own tears. This is one few films that give me teary-eyed goosebumps even thinking about it, or by listening to Ennio Morricone's score on (one of few scores I can listen to fully on repeat). I hate to imagine how much of a nihilist one would have to be not moved by the scene in which Alfredo makes a projected image travel along the walls and into the town square to the booming music.For the original Italian release or director's cut, the film had a run time of 173 minutes, for the international release it was cut to 124 minutes. I have to say however I greatly prefer the cut version. The director's cut examines the romantic relationship between characters Toto and Elena in much more detail, turning what is a subplot in cut version into a main focus of the story and while interesting to see the loose ends and the explained justification for Alfredo's actions, it does cause the movie to drag and in turn creating a version of the film with less emotional impact, whereas the cut version is a perfectly paced film. It also takes away some of the mystery posed by the shorter version, showing that some stories are best left untold and not everything has to be explained. I still feel the longer version is worth watching but it has made me dubious of director's cuts.Anyone passionate about cinema can't afford to miss Cinema Paradiso (that being unless you're a hardcore cynic, then this film will send you into a fit of rage) but aside from being a tribute to cinema, the film is full of emotions for nostalgia of childhood and youth, love and the losses we have to deal with during our lives. Like the stamp of any truly great film, Cinema Paradiso is a movie which you don't want to end. The cut version of Cinema Paradiso is Cinema Perfecto.International Cut - 10/10

97,Hunky Stud,A timeless classic,9,23 August 2003,"I watched the DVD at home. At first, I didn't expect this to be so interesting to watch, I was planning to watch something else after 10 or 20 minutes, because it seems to be so long (almost 2 hours). Once I started the movie, I just can't stop watching till the end. Then I found out that on the side B, it has over 50 minutes extra in the new version. Now I wish that I could have just watched this new version instead. Anyway, this is definitely a timeless classic. I am surprised to find out that it was made in 1988, and today is August 23rd of 2003. The film still hasn't lost its freshness and attraction, as you probably know that different films in different years have quite different art directions. The music is distinct, and was used at the right times. They are similar to the music in `Life is Beautiful.' 	It is indeed emotional, and touching. However, the bottom line is that it is just an ordinary story about one ordinary person. At the end, I don't think that it has inspired anyone to do great things in the future, etc. There is not much real ups or downs. It is very similar to the Chinese movie called `Shadow Magic.' And I also liked the story that Alferdo told the Toto about the young man waited for 99 days then left on the last day. I like movies that end with questions, and unfinished romance. It makes me wonder what really happened to the girl that he loved....",Cinema Paradiso
98,zeekwunlau,Everyone has a movie theater in heaven,8,24 April 2020,"No matter what you do in the end, love it.Paradise is like a tornado black and white film that never stops. People's hearts and flying films reach a high degree of understanding. If the pianist at sea interprets the meaning of life with music, and the beautiful legend of Sicily reveals the parallel relationship between fantasy and cold reality with beauty and reality, then Paradise Cinema is using light and shadow to perceive life, watching movies in life, and watching in movies. lifetime.Naturally, it reminds people of Borges 's words, ""I used to imagine that heaven is like a library."" For Toto, heaven is like a movie theater, a sentence on a classic screen that is handed down to adults The infinite fantasy and anticipation of the comic scenes of the handsome men and women who have stopped them is the worship and curiosity of the projector and the light and shadow controlled by Uncle Everett. Toto loves movies better than anything. It is the movies that taught him to fantasize, love, perceive art and beauty, and cherish a simple friendship. Record changes in light and shadow in everything about culture, whether it's Charlie Chaplin, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, Ingrid Bergman, Vivien Leigh ... imitating art. Movies are not just means and forms, they are a better portrayal of our hearts, condensing the life of people, the rise and fall of culture, and the decay of the times on the screen of one ten thousandth of time and one ten thousandth. Here, only the audience and the appreciators will be thrown dung with the noble appearance of abandoning others in the cinema. There is no hierarchy. The Paradise Cinema treats people equally, even deaf and blind people, as long as they have love, fantasy and passion Audience, Paradise Cinema will give you everything you want.The Paradise Cinema is actually a collective artistic consensus and cognition, a carrier of precious memories. When the cinema is demolished, the villagers will say goodbye to it like an old friend, and weep for him. The crazy man attached to the square is actually a typical cultural epitome. It is a mourning song for paradise. The cinema is a combination of nobility and lowliness, ordinary and great, and vulgar and elegant. It is equal to noble and cheap, charming and inviting. Whether it is there or you know it, it does not require knowledge and culture as a carrier, only a simple pursuit and desire to indulge in imitation and story. A feast of imitation of language, expression, structure, music, and thought.But after all, the film is imitating. The life of a person is as short as a film. ""Life is not the same as film. Life is much harder than film.""It was Evrido's advice that allowed Toto to recognize the reality, and the loss and nostalgia for the erosion of summer love, let him inherit a piece of heaven.",Cinema Paradiso

Who passed away 2 days ago and so creates a big vacuum to fill in the cinema industry. Reading a few comments I was rather surprise to see no reference to Philipe Noiret as a French person in an Italian movie. This shocked me almost as much as I recognised him when I went to see this wonderful and quite talked about movie in Sydney (yes Australia) open air screening in the city botanic garden, (I think during the Sydney Festival that is the month of January...some years ago).

106,Bob Pr.,2 different movies: the 1990 cut version is best; the restored version is next,8,6 January 2012,"The majority of people (but certainly not ALL) writing ""User Reviews"" that have seen both the US cut version from 1990 AND the recently restored 'director's cut' 3 hr. version (from 1988)--those people prefer the shorter version much more and recommend watching it before seeing the longer version. I strongly agree (and so does Roger Ebert).They are 2 different movies and to appreciate both, you need to see the shorter version first. I rate the cut version 9 of 10 stars and the longer version 7/10. So I'll average it out to an 8/10. The 2 hr. cut version is amusing, tender and nostalgic, the story of how a life-long fascination with movies developed in a boy's (Toto's) childhood and led to his life work.The original 1998 Italian (now restored) 3 hr. version elaborates, in far greater detail, on many of the losses and sacrifices that accompanied Toto's fascination and, for some/many viewers, in so doing it effectively wipes out much of the tenderness and nostalgia experienced in the shorter version.In the original, longer (restored) version, we find that Alfredo, the projectionist, who served as the functional father figure to Toto (Toto is the film's central figure), was instrumental in keeping Toto from connecting with Elena, the love of his young life. Alfredo believes in and instills in Toto the belief that the world operates on a ""one at the expense of another"" principle such that IF Toto loves movies and wants to make them, he MUST give up all other loves: Elena, and warm relationships with Toto's family, and even his relation with Alfredo. It's as if people can reach for and achieve only one important thing in their lives: a wife, or family, or supportive friends -- or an achievement. But IF it's for an achievement, then ALL else, all other wants, yearnings, must be sacrificed.Is this a rule in life?There's an interesting thread in the Message Board of this film titled ""Is Alfredo the most evil movie villain ever?""

107,paudie,Entertaining but not on my all time classic movie list,7,23 August 2011,"Cinema Paradiso had been on my list of ""must watch movies"" for years. I did enjoy it but think it does not deserve the very high ranking it gets in many greatest ever movie lists.The movie deals with how our experiences in our youth can have an indelible affect on the rest of our lives.I won't go into the story in depth but it begins as the young Toto, living in a Sicilian village, befriends Alfredo, who loads the film reels in the local cinema. We then follow Toto as he grows up and there are plenty of funny and touching incidents involving the people of the village. The film is unashamedly sentimental and at times perhaps even melodramatic.I watched the ""Directors Cut"". It is nearly three hours long but I cheated by watching in three sittings so I can't comment on whether this version is too long or not.The closing scene is one of the best in the movie as the director leaves it up to the audience to decide whether personal happiness or the creation of great art is more important.",Cinema Paradiso
108,krational66,Film Heaven,9,10 April 2020,"Youth is a kind of capital, and nostalgia only belongs to the old.
When a world collapses, you always see some people crying and others smiling. It is always the young who laugh, for they look forward and see that the destruction of the old world means the birth of a new world.
I don't know why, after watching ""cinema paradise"", the deepest picture in my mind is that when the cinema collapsed, the smiling faces of the young people, the thunderous applause filled the air of the small town, accompanied by the sigh of the old people.
Heaven belongs to the nostalgic, because it is a simple and innocent ideal of the past. The past is a dream, that's why it's beautiful. Time will beautify all cruel things, to wear a hazy veil of pain.
The old evert said to the young saverto, ""you are so young, the world is yours. And I'm old. I don't want to listen to you any more. I want to hear people talk about you. ""Such a sincere piece of heart, hidden, but all is a vision of the future. Only youth is always looking forward, in the long stream of time, is a little optimism and hope for the faith.
So saverto left, with lost love and a broken heart, never to return.
If there is no expectation of the eternal, then love is just a dream, but, leave that little expectation, life from then on to bear such a heavy cross.
The immortal cross, how could savertu not understand? The 30 dazzling years in the movie are actually 30 365 days in real life. Cut out the banal, trivial, realistic details, so that the past 30 years ago is such a beautiful story.
Unfortunately, that's just the story.
Children always love fairytales. They have no past and have no time to remember their short life. They expect to hear the ending that the prince and princess live happily ever after. When young, is never to think, in fact, the end is just a beginning, and the real end, is writing behind the endless trivial and trouble.
The king may also die in battle one day, leaving the widowed queen alone. Their children may be demented. Somewhere in the palace garden, love is rotting. One day, when all the people are old, only the wrinkles of the eyes are still flashing a little clear light, perhaps only then, is to write the real ending time.
But everyone did not like to hear such stories, young people, happy to witness the birth of a new world, but do not want to go to the old world that was full of joy. When we go to remember, perhaps, our hearts have been old.
I guess I do.",Cinema Paradiso

The structure of the film is very well achieved, following a narrative that goes from a child's innocence, where love is seen as something platonic and not physical, to adolescence and early adulthood, where first love and the great heartbreak come together, and ending in midlife crisis, where melancholy and sadness awaken long-buried feelings.

Almost 30 years later I revisited Cinema Paradiso (I also saw the released director's cut version somewhere in between) and experienced a slightly different response to a film that I originally enjoyed unconditionally. I still enjoyed it immensely and continued to be touched by its expressions of love for the art of film, the love of love itself, community, family, and tradition. Ennio Moriccone's score still hit my ears as beautifully lyrical and melancholy as ever, only this time I noticed its indulgent overuse. I noticed many of the Italian film cliches that I somehow either didn't notice or instantly forgave in my youth. Despite noticing Tornatore's many indulgences I remain a fan of Cinema Paradiso and yes, I too find the ending scene very moving. I would like to add that I did not enjoy the longer director's version and if you're only going to see one or the other that you stick with the original US release version.",Cinema Paradiso
111,brianberta,A pretty good film,6,18 July 2016,"My reaction to this film when I watched it a few years ago was that its first hour was great, but the second hour made a couple poor choices which reduced it to a good film. I had a feeling my opinion would grow this time around, but unfortunately, it remained the same and, if anything, this rewatch solidified my opinion of it even more.In spite of my issues with this film though, I don't consider it to be a bad film by any means, The aforementioned first hour, in fact, is about as entertaining and moving as any film has the right to be. Tornatore crafts such a humorous and vividly detailed film which is packed with a few different types of greatness. For example, some of the humor involving Alfredo and Toto resonated with me quite well, like the touches of humor thrown into some of their tense encounters in the first act or Toto helping Alfredo cheat on a test. These bits made their building friendship a blast to watch. I also enjoyed the emphasis given to multiple side characters who either attended the theater or were frequently seen outside it. There's a priest who orders Alfredo to cut all the inappropriate scenes from the films (kissing scenes, typically), a tramp who believes he owns the town square outside the theater, a man who spits on people from the upper balcony of the theater, a man who frequently gets pranked for falling asleep during the movies, and the general rowdiness of the crowd that attends the theater. It's clear that the theater is the centerpiece of the town and the main (well, the only) pastime for many of the town's citizens. Finally, I liked how the film saved most of its sentimentality for the ending. Complimented with Morricone's terrific score, it's almost impossible not to be moved during the final montage.While the film's first hour is strong, the second hour makes some odd narrative choices which fail to capitalize on that potential. Since Alfredo's and Toto's friendship is established for most of the first hour, I found it strange how the second half shifted so much focus away from Alfredo. Instead, we get a romance sub-plot between Toto and Elena. Though I've yet to watch the extended cuts of this film, I've read a decent bit about them and my understanding is that they provide a better thematic significance for that sub-plot, so I may enjoy this film more if I watch those versions. Who knows. With the international cut though, that sub-plot took time away from what I liked the most about the film. To top it off, I also found certain elements of that sub-plot creepy, like Toto waiting outside Elena's house for (I think) 100 days in an attempt to get her to like him. After the focus finally gets back to Alfredo, he only stays onscreen for about five more more minutes and, while I found their conversations during those five minutes powerful, they ultimately left me asking for more. Granted, the final act is kind of effective and the aforementioned ending is terrific, but the middle act was a huge misstep and left me very cold. And it's a real shame, because the film had a lot going for it with the first hour. The second hour failed to follow up on that potential though.In spite of my issues though, I'd still recommend the film. The strengths of the first hour and the ending were more than enough to save the day, so I did enjoy the film. Just like my first viewing though, I wasn't so crazy on the second hour. I'll likely check out the longer cuts in the future though to see if this film finally clicks with me.",Cinema Paradiso
112,santiagocosme,"Quite simply, my favorite movie!",10,6 December 2014,"Generally speaking, no one can really say what their favorite movie is, but when I am asked the question, the first movie that comes to my mind is ""Cinema Paradiso"".I am not sure whether this is the movie every filmmaker wished they had made, as some people claim, but without a doubt it has to be the most beautiful movie ever made about the love of cinema! The last scene is simply scintillating. Toto, now an adult, is handed a box with film cut outs of kissing scenes that were banned when he was a kid. And Alfredo wanted him to have them after his death. When he plays the video, alone in a cinema, and Enio Morricone's music starts, you feel elevated and invaded by all sorts of emotions. I was at the cinema for the 25th anniversary of this film, and everybody was crying by the time this scene started. Me included.

113,Artimidor,Paradisiacal cinema? - Tornatore did it!,10,7 February 2012,"If you love movies you owe it yourself to see ""Cinema Paradiso"" made by the Sicilian director Giuseppe Tornatore. It contains about everything that the cinema is about (or maybe better: once was), and more. Tornatore also wrote the screenplay for this film and it can be felt throughout that the material comes from his heart, drawing from own experiences and those related to him - the director even has a cameo appearance as a projectionist in the final minutes. ""Cinema Paradiso"" is as powerful as it is not only because of its topic, the direction and the screenplay, but also because of its scope - spanning the whole lifetime of the main character -, its memorable imagery, Ennio Morricone's brilliant score and of course the carefully chosen cast headed by Philippe Noiret. By the way: Even grandmaster Fellini might have made it into the movie, intended for the role of the mentioned projectionist at the very end. But he replied to the director's request: ""At such an important part of the movie putting a face so bulky like mine could be distracting to the audience. I suggest an unknown person instead: Let Tornatore do it!"" Well, so we've still got a master of cinema up there at least - the one who made ""Cinema Paradiso"".To sum it up: Here we have not just any film about the cinema, it's the definitive one - and in the 50 minutes longer director's cut an already great experience becomes perfect. If you are reading reviews like this and still haven't seen it, you better finish this sentence and then be off to get it. Quick!",Cinema Paradiso

115,hunter-friesen,A film that tries way too hard to make you care,5,6 April 2018,"Emotions can make or break a film. Have too little, and your film has no weight and no importance. Have too much and your film will be unbelievable and schmaltzy. Giuseppe Tornatore's 1988 feature Cinema Paradiso definitely falls into the latter category. It's overflowing with forced emotions that take you out more than they invest you in. Nostalgia may have blinded some people from seeing this Oscar-winning film from what it really is, a manipulative and cliched tale that is never original or worthwhile of your time.World War II is still in full swing in the Italian countryside. The only kind of entertainment in town in the local cinema, Cinema Paradiso. Every night people arrive in droves to escape from the tragedies of reality. Out of all the attendees, the most passionate one is Toto. He's a young boy who has a passion for film and will do anything to learn more about it. Current projectionist Alfredo reluctantly takes him under his wing and begins to teach him the skills necessary to be a projectionist. From this point, Toto and Alfredo begin a lifelong friendship, one that we witness as the film tracks Toto's life from childhood to adult. Cinema Paradiso is a very, very conventional film that never does anything out of the ordinary. Maybe that's why some people love it. It harkens back to the golden age of cinema, one filled with melodrama and two-bit characters. But for me, the nostalgia feels almost politically manipulative. It shows historical clips from old films that are supposed to make you feel good, which in turns makes you feel good about the film as a whole. It's the same technique used by any movie that includes a ton of pop culture references to try and win your emotional attachment. It feels forced and cheap, almost like the director doesn't trust his crew.The film also overplayed its hand when it comes to delivering on the emotions. Nothing you feel is natural. Everything is presented with so much artificial drama and weight that it soon becomes tiresome to watch. It feels like a ploy by the director to get you to care about the film. It also feels so political and awards baity towards the Oscar voters. ""Look at how important cinema is!"" is the main message that is repeated numerous times, each times getting more and more irritating. Ennio Morricone is one of the greatest composers of all time, and he proves it here with a great theme. It has a classical and uplifting beat that perfectly captures the tone of the film. Unfortunately, Tornatore gives Morricone the ultimate disrespect by using so many times that it too becomes annoying to hear.One positive that I can say is that the actors were quite good, especially the pair of Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio as Alfredo and young Toto, respectively. They have great chemistry and are able to carry the early parts of the film with ease. Marco Leonardi does a pretty good job as adolescent Toto. He mostly just coasts off his good looks, but he does bring some complexity to his character. He does struggle with the emotional bits however and comes off a bit too hammy. This is one of the clearest cut cases of what a film did right and what it did wrong. The performances and music are all there, but the directing is atrocious and sinks everything. This would be a must-see film if a more serious director had taken the helm. Unfortunately, hindsight is 20/20 and what we are left with is a film that tries way too hard to make you care about what it wants to say.",Cinema Paradiso

117,arthera09,"heard great things about this film, but",7,20 April 2008,"I heard great things about this film and never would have watched it, but it came highly recommended. I did enjoy the film, but I watched the directors cut which was close to pushing 3 hours. I am not sure what got added, but I think a lot of the films power was lost with additional scenes that slowed the pace down. I loved the idea and I got the message, but I just did not feel it at the end. There were scenes that I loved and they made me smile and there are some great lines, but in the end I did not feel that it was terribly inventive and did not create that sense of awe and love that I have for cinema. I loved the scene when Elena comes back during the showing of the movie in the outdoor cinema and it starts raining. It was cliché, but it worked and was perfect for the movie. It has always been hard for me to enjoy movies about the love of movies because I feels as if few of them can capture the emotion that we as viewers derive from movies. I think part of the reason I missed some of the movie was it was only recently that I really started enjoying movies. Growing up I did not really look forward to watching them and they were nothing special. The love story aspect of the movie was weak in my opinion and did not need to be fleshed out as much as it was. I would have liked to have imagined that they just missed each other and not it told me exactly how it happened. I also guess I did not agree with Alfredo's idea that he could never return and that Toto was bound for greatness and that could only be achieved with a complete separation from his roots. Going back and revisiting the past at an early point of his life might have brought Toto more closure, I know it did for me. I know this movie is rated really high in the all time list and I am not sure if I agree with it, but I don't think I saw the version that most people voted for. Also I think I was lost on the fact that I did not know any of the movies that were shown in the theater at any point, which is in a way sad to me.",Cinema Paradiso

I think the reason Cinema Paradiso works on so many levels and so well for movie lovers is that many can relate to the story. We see this boy grow up and fall in love with film, we see him fall, rise, make friends, have a mentor, his first love, his first heartbreak. And haven't we all felt that? Haven't we all wondered what if? This movie goes through all those stages in the man's life, and it's wonderful.The ending is so perfect, because throughout the last act, we notice that Toto feels insecure about his decisions in life. Did he do the right thing? And he wonders if Alfredo was right in telling him to go away for good...because, who is he to tell him how to run his life? But in the end, Salvatore, now a famous director, watches all the kiss scenes that were cut out that Alfredo was holding for him since he was a kid. He realizes his love for film, and that he needed to leave in order to become the man he is now. He watches the reel in tears, realizing he owes everything to Alfredo.Cinema Paradiso is a film that most movie lovers will enjoy, I am sure of it.

Stupid unbelievable characters and then a fairly tame soap opera story.  Where was the depth, where was the profound message, basically there wasn't one.In the end this could have easily been produced by Hollywood.  There was a real sense of passion missing.  Toto wanted to be a film maker, but didn't really demonstrate his passion for films other than wanting to be a projectionist.  Tag on a predictable love story and a bit of sentimentality, that seemed out of place.  What was the big deal, yes people liked the cinema house, but I can't say they felt any true love for it.

128,marissas75,"Aims for magic, settles for clichés",4,10 June 2007,"Since ""Cinema Paradiso"" is billed as a joyful celebration of movies for all of us who love them, I am sorry to say that its charms were lost on me. Its story of young Salvatore ""Toto"" who discovers the magic of the movies through his friendship with projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) has potential, but too often falls prey to false sentimentality, muddled storytelling, and unbelievable characters. It got to the point where I thought that the remote Sicilian village wasn't even a real location, but rather a soundstage set (the piazza seems too big and tidy).I watched the 122-minute version, not the 170-minute director's cut, but I still felt that ""Cinema Paradiso"" was too long, padded with innumerable ""local color"" scenes. The townspeoplewho are all stock comic characters, including a village idiotsit in the movie theater and react quirkily to the film they're watching. Presumably, this is meant to show how important the cinema is for them, bringing glamour and romance into their difficult lives. But since you never get a sense of what these people are individually like outside the movie theater, the contrast between real life and reel life isn't deeply felt.Toto is not a very sympathetic character in any of his three incarnations. At first, he is an annoyingly impish, prank-pulling little boy; then a lovesick and wildly impractical teenager; then a successful middle-aged film director who seems to have no inner life whatsoever. (Evidently, the middle-aged Toto is more developed in the director's cut, but I don't know if I have the patience to sit through that one!) The movie's attempt at heart-tugging romance falls flat because Toto's love interest Elena is so poorly characterized--all actress Agnese Nano has to do is stand there and look pretty. Noiret is good, though, moving beyond the cliché of the ""crusty but lovable mentor"" to reveal Alfredo's deep bitterness and determination that Toto not make the same mistakes he did. The famous ending montage of all the screen kisses that a conservative priest had censored is a lovely celebration of old Hollywood, but nothing that you can't find in the Academy Awards tribute montages every year. It also requires a major suspension of disbelief weren't all these prints lost when the movie theater burned down? The best scene in ""Cinema Paradiso,"" coming closest to conveying just what's so special about the movies, is when Alfredo turns his movie projector to face the window and screens a film on the outside of a building. The beam of silver light shoots through the empty black air; for an instant, all is magical, illuminated, even incendiary. Unfortunately, instead of creating many more new and wondrous moments like this one, ""Cinema Paradiso"" mostly falls back on old plot devices and one-dimensional characters.",Cinema Paradiso

You don´t know what you´re missing !CINEMA PARADISO, is, ( along with THE BIG BLUE ), my all time favorite movie ever, ( I can never choose between them ). It has the most beautiful story I´ve seen in a movie so far.
Many people don´t like it, but I can bet those people don´t truly love cinema. They´re just ordinary movie goers who consume movies as fast food. Anyone who loves Cinema has to love CINEMA PARADISO !I used to think that italian movies were only those junk crapPseudo-erotic "" PORKYS "" style comedies or else those Art Films that the very intelligent Elite of film critics pretend to like, and so I only went to see CINEMA PARADISO, a few months after his release, because I was thinking that this would be one more of those.I was wrong. This is the most beautifuly filmed love story ever, on par only with CASABLANCA although in a very diferent style. It´s amazing how this movie by telling a love story and a life of a character in fact tells about the history of cinema itself. The use of the theater location as a conection between characters through out the years is magnificently done.And it has probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever !Very emotive and capturing perfectly the story in all its moments.And it has the most beautiful and moving ending ever filmed! No matter how many times we see this film. I bet everybody drops a tear at the end. And more than a tear, I´m sure. I do.This is one of those rare moments in modern cinema that can´t be described. It has to be felt.This movie is a true MASTERPIECE ! Please go and see it. It realy deserves not to be ignored.Do yourselves a favor and go see it.You´ll never forget it. Believe me. It´s that good.",Cinema Paradiso

137,shneur,You'll want to watch this one more than once.,9,26 March 2005,"This is a lovely, sensitive film which evokes a variety of emotions, leaving the viewer with a sort of satisfied exhaustion, like after a good session of yard work. Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in ""first love"" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished.",Cinema Paradiso
138,GuyCC,A Movie For Movie Lovers.,10,30 January 2000,"""Cinema Paradiso"" is an amazing example of a film. If the fact that this film is spoken in Italian has kept you away from this film, disregard that. You'll soon forget about the subtitles as the world this movie draws you into its wondrous world. Anyone who has ever believed in the magic that a movie projector can create will feel a tinge of nostalgic joy as this film shows a love of movies, friendship, romance and life that is simply not represented in every film. The musical score is emotional and romantic, and adds even more to the story. The story itself fulfills every expectation that a hopeless romantic could hope for. The ending has been mentioned repeatedly in other comments, but it's as memorable as what everyone praises it is. It never fails to touch me.""Cinema Paradiso"" remains one of my favorite movies of all time. A very warm and nostalgic movie that touches a person in a way that few films can.

Many of the films I had seen in recent times were so badly conceived that I was beginning to lose my passion for film.I had heard about Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, because it was on people's favourite movie lists, and was a top IMDb film. When I saw it on sale, I bought it, and that's when it all happened. I fell in love with cinema again.I'm not going to go into the details of the many characters and situations in this film. Suffice it to say, it is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. I have the largest film collection of anyone I know, and this film is without a doubt in my top ten. It is full of love, nostalgia and beauty.Both versions of this film are great, but angle the overall piece in different ways. The extended version (director's cut) concentrates a lot on the aftermath of the love story, and is essential viewing for anyone who loves this film. You can easily fall in love with this film watching the shortened version only, however.Overall, I am back in love with cinema, and this incredible film is the one and only reason for this. The word ""masterpiece"" was created for this movie.",Cinema Paradiso
140,Marx_Bros_Fan86,A Wonderful Movie,9,11 December 2010,"Please note this is a review of the 123 minute 1988 release. I have not seen the extended DVD cut.Cinema Paradiso was made for people who love movies. Everyone who frequently visits this site has one movie (maybe more) that had a huge impact on their lives. Salvatore, commonly known as Toto, represents people like us, except he took his love of films and became a rich and famous director, but that's beside the point. The film takes place in a small town in Sicily shortly after World War II. Toto's father had been killed in the war, and his mother never remarried. The movie theater becomes Toto's home away from home, and he is fascinated by the projection room. Alfredo, the projectionist in the local movie theater, becomes a surrogate father to Toto and teaches him how to work the projectors. This starts one of the most touching friendships you will ever see in a movie. Ennio Morricone's score certainly helps with that, but Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio (young Toto) have good chemistry and Cascio was one of the better child actors I've seen, but maybe that's because I don't speak Italian.When Alfredo is blinded by a fire, Toto takes his place as the projectionist, but they maintain their friendship. As Toto grows up, he falls in love, but Alfredo encourages him to pursue a career in film. He leaves the prospect of a happy life in his own town for the sake of a successful career, something that many of us don't do when faced with the decision. When Toto reaches adulthood and becomes a successful filmmaker, he has not found a woman that matched the girlfriend from his teenage years, but the ending reinforces his love of movies and reminds him why he made the decision in the first place. The last scene is too good to spoil so you will just have to find out for yourself! I have to admit the first act of the movie where Toto is a child is superior to the second and third act, but the first act is so strong it really does not matter, and the ending just makes it even stronger.The scenes inside the movie theater are the highlight of the film for me. Cinema Paradiso brings people back to the days when movies were EVENTS. Young people might not understand this today, because movies come out on DVD four months or so after they leave theaters. Even in 1989, movies were not as monumental as they used to be, what with the invention of the television and the VCR. In Cinema Paradiso, when the theater gets a new movie, the whole town sees it and interacts with it as if the actors can hear them. The theater's central location in the town gives it the importance of a church, as Roger Ebert noted. The destruction of the movie theater at the end of the movie symbolized the death of an era. It is only a matter of time before a movie studio releases a movie on DVD while it is in theaters, but hopefully, movie theaters will never die, because there is just no substitute for the big screen experience.If you're an American and you've never seen a foreign film before, this is where you should start. This was my first exposure to foreign cinema (I was in grammar school) and I loved it. Don't be intimidated by the subtitles!",Cinema Paradiso
141,kevjfarrell,Sheer Delight,10,7 February 2016,"I revisited this movie recently after many years. I remember enjoying it when I first saw it, but this time I was totally blown away with it.It is one of the most charming and delightful movies told in hindsight about a young boy growing up in a small town in Italy. The story goes back to before WW2. The young boy is in love with the films shown at the local movie house. Most of the townsfolk use the cinema as their main source of entertainment watching Hollywood movies that have been dubbed into Italian.The young boy builds up a lifelong friendship with the projectionist and becomes his protégé. There are wonderful snippets of the quirky inhabitants of the town. As the young lad matures, he's encouraged to spread his wings and make something of himself in the world - eventually he does.Many years on, he has reason to return to his old home town which he hasn't seen for twenty years. It gives him a chance to reminisce.The story is so cute, beautiful, tender, heart-warming and funny. It's a must-see movie for any movie lover. It's rare for me to rate a movie 10/10, but I have no hesitation with this one.",Cinema Paradiso
142,Andreas_N,The magic of the movies,7,5 March 2006,"Cinema Paradiso is a very simple movie with one particular theme that makes it special: The magic of the movies. The storyline follows the path of a famous Italian director and traces his career back to his early childhood days, when he spent countless hours with his adult friend Alfredo in the projection room of the little cinema in their village. The two of them grow quite close, and it is fair to say that Alfredo becomes a kind of real father for little Toto, whose natural father died in World War II. After a horrible incident that leaves Alfredo blind, Toto himself becomes the projectionist, a job he performs for many years.The movie further extensively elaborates on Toto's first love and on many subtle themes, such as Alfredo fatherly guidance and Toto's time in the army. Throughout the proceedings of the story, the magic of movies plays an important part. The inspiration and impact on ordinary people in those early days of the cinema, the way people were emotionally stirred and how they participated actively with cheers, laughters and even tears, all these aspects are transformed into the movie in a way that is maybe a bit over-subscribed and occasionally a bit corny, but very authentic and with a marked nostalgic edge.Cinema Paradiso is a very subtle and slow movie. It is a typical Italian movie in terms of pace and camera work. I was occasionally reminded of Once Upon A Time in America and Martin Scorsese's narrative style. It is a very nostalgic movie with lots of sad moments that make you aware of the passing of time. At the same it is the story of Toto and his relationship with Alfredo, who was more a father than a friend to him. It is maybe a bit two long, and some moments could have been made more interesting and more helpful for a quicker proceeding of storyline developments. 8/10.",Cinema Paradiso
143,fred-houpt,"One of the greatest films, timeless.",10,15 November 2009,"I have enjoyed this film since it's release. Sat down to watch my old VHS copy last night. The edit on film was a bit wobbly, should get the DVD and see if it is cleaner. My copy is the original, shorter version, not the longer one that came out later.What can you say about this film? You don't have to like Italian cinema to savour this films joys, but it helps if you do. There is a long tradition in Italian movie making to highlight the pathos, struggles of the poor and the humour in odd (but mostly Italian) behaviour. This film plays to that tradition. Sentimental recollection of what was left behind in poverty stricken Sicily as a local boy, energetic in his obsession with films, leaves his history and family behind him only to become a great success. At an unanticipated moment he is brought back home to mourn the loss of his most beloved mentor and father figure. The closer he looks to drink in all that has changed in his home town during a 30 year absence the more it seems to him that nothing has changed. Perhaps just the outer layers have added different coverings, but underneath it he wonders what has changed especially in himself.There is almost nothing lacking in this film. Certainly one of Ennio Morricone's most haunting and heartfelt soundtracks move one to laughter and tears and we welcome it all. The chemistry between all cast members was perfect, especially between the beloved Philippe Noiret and both actors who played Toto as a child and young man. Antonella Attili's role as Toto's mother is given depth, tenderness and suffering without over indulgence. Her issues speak for themselves and as a young Sicilian mother trying to raise a small family without a husband we fully appreciate why she cries in anguish.This is a masterpiece of storytelling, evoking the depths of the human experience while maintaining an over all subtle sense of optimism. One can rise from a seemingly stifling environment and find fulfilment. A film to be watched many times, enjoying the tears and laughter. Superb.",Cinema Paradiso
144,JesNollie,"A wonderful, wonderful movie.",10,8 July 2001,"What a great film!  IMO this movie has one of the best endings in movie history.

145,AlbertCinefilu,A Mesmerizing Poem Dedicated to Cinema and Life.,10,11 January 2021,"This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, as well as one of the saddest. I have no idea what to praise first. Ennio Morricone's bewitching soundtrack? Giuseppe Tornatore's soulful story and incredibly well-written screenplay? The cinematography and set that transported me into one of the most magical lost worlds I've ever witnessed on screen?Cinema is not just a place where you hang out with friends here, it is LIFE, it is MAGIC! A drunkard, a mother nursing his child, a despiteful critic spitting onto others' heads, the first kiss and true love and many other magic details and important moments of various human lives are depicted onscreen and add a certain unique taste to the movie, making it way more real, lively and genuine than I've expected. And then the downwards spiral from there on...I wish I was alive in 1988 so I could see the movie when it first aired on the big screen. Thinking about it now, aside from nostalgia, it certainly made me experience a similar but slightly different feeling that the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows calls ''Anemoia'' - some sort of nostalgia for a past time you've never really experienced but wished to. I'll re-watch this movie one day, sure I'll do.

I actually sat through this monster twice and I can say that it doesn't even get any better the second time.The theme of the movie (that is, maturing and allowing yourself to move on with your life, as opposed to the pretty picture movies portray) is admirable and comprehensible.  However, there are some major problems that overwhelm this strength.  First, the film is entirely too long.  It feels like the director just tossed in every single ""growing up"" cliché he could think of and the result is that the movie takes up waaaay too much of your life.  Second, in spite of the first problem, this film has huge story gaps that took place as a result of massive editing (as I understand it, this film was originally well over three hours).  Third, the film makes no real attempt to establish empathy with the audience.  It instead makes the erroneous assumption that we will just see Alfred and Toto and be instantly smitten with these lovable characters.  Wrong again.  I too often found them annoying and ridiculous (especially Toto) to have any real emotional bonds with anyone.The ending is decent, but it would have had more effect had all of the previous clutter not been strewn about the film.  All in all, this was just way to mushy and bloated for me.",Cinema Paradiso

Salvatore is a mischievous young boy who develops a passion for cinema. The film's projectionist Alfredo mentors the boy and becomes a surrogate father to him. It engages wonderfully with themes of community, growth and nostalgia. There is very strong emphasis in remembering where you came from. One thing I didn't like though was the love story they gave Salvatore. I felt that this was contrived and unnecessary. it didn't add anything to the plot.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/vtbGiX",Cinema Paradiso
153,gentendo,Tornatore's Purpose,9,12 October 2007,"From the opening shot of the film, Tornatore metaphorically suggests that the story is going to be about the journey and progression of a human life. How does he accomplish this? The viewer is first exposed to a close-up of a garden pot sitting outside amidst a summer breeze. Inside the pot grows a small and simple leaf. While continuing to show this leaf, the camera begins to slowly dolly backwards into a home. At the end of the dolly shot lays a basket of fruitimplicating that every human life begins as a small and humble seed. Through a progression of time (suggested through the dolly movement), the seed grows, developments, and eventually becomes a basket of fruit. In other words, time is what allows people to grow into something more mature as they learn to bring forth the fruits of their labors.Having mentioned the fruits of one's labors, Tornatore suggests that one of those fruits that has to be worked for is love. There are three predominant themes of love throughout this filmcinematic love, romantic love, and restoration of love.Cinematic Love: The assumption that Tornatore seems to make is that those who like this film are also those who love going to the movies on a regular basis. Ironically, the lead character is also a person who loves going to the movieswe're watching a movie about a boy who loves watching movies. Salvatore seems to be a tribute character based off the real life of the directorhence the reason why Tornatore made this film (it's his own tribute to the love he has for cinema). There are other characters in the story who represent stereotypical friends the viewer might have while watching certain movies (i.e. the man who always falls asleep during movies, the man who has memorized every line from his favorite movie, and the heckler who spits on people below the balcony while watching movies). If the audience has love for any of these characters, it is because they relate to them on a very truthful level. They might actually know people like the ones portrayed in the film.Romantic Love: Tornatore not only shows the love Salvatore has for movies, but also the romantic love he has for Elena. As mentioned earlier, this love is demonstrated when he proves himself by waiting day and night for ninety daysthrough rain and sunshineoutside her house. His purpose in waiting is that he hopes for her to develop a love for him. This is a beautiful sequence because earlier this story was told to Salvatore by Alfredo as a simple anecdote with no real meaning. Salvatore, however, believed there was meaning to it and becomes an active participant in bringing the story to lifethus acquiring him love.Restoration of Love: Despite Salvatore's love for movies and Elena, there seems to be a void of love in his life that he wishes to restore throughout the film. In the beginning, the absence of his father's love causes him to look to Alfredo, who acts as his surrogate father. Later in the story when he loses Elena and moves away from home, the relationships he has with other women deteriorate. He moves from one woman to another in hopes to restore what he once had with Elena but never quite filling the void. Both of these loves (fatherly and romantic) are beautifully restored to him at the end of the film. Alfredo leaves behind a spliced reel of all the censored kisses that were taken out by Father Adelfio. These images were ones that Salvatore wanted as a child but were never given to him. The reel not only represents his love for film, but also his love for romance. Because it was spliced specifically by Alfredo, Salvatore's love is once again restored and he feels he is complete.",Cinema Paradiso

The film's duration seems too long, only because one thinks that this movie is about childhood upon viewing its first half, while in truth, it is rather a biography. It does seem, though, as if the director just cared more about the film's ending, rather than the film in its entirety and that he aims at our sensitivity in order to make us sentimental and wet-eyed so that we *like* the film.

It conveys us the viewer to the simple ways of life, to experience all aspects of human emotion and be transported there as only the cream of films can do.

The first part of the flashback takes us back to Giancaldo in Sicily, and recounts how young Toto was so entranced with the movies being shown in the local movie house, the Cinema Paradiso. He constantly hung around Alfredo's (played by Phillip Noiret) projection room. Eventually, when Alfredo gets disabled in an accident, the child Toto took over the projectionist job.The second part of the flashback recounts the teenage Salvatore (played by Marco Leonardi) still doing his film projectionist job, while beginning his fledgling career as a movie maker. A lengthy part was devoted to his ill-fated obsession with the beautiful Elena. This unsuccessful love affair makes Salvatore take Alfredo's advice to leave Giancaldo and make something out of his life.In this Director's Cut DVD that I watched, another subplot was restored, which was cut out in the international release that won the Oscar Best Foreign Film back in 1988. This involved the older Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) going back to Giancaldo for Alfredo's funeral, and getting the chance to reunite the older Elena.

I remember renting the video many years ago and being taken by its flow that merged a coming of age theme of a young boy captured by cinema in an Italian town and his friendship with the theater operator.  The operator was a somewhat mentor for the boy, and the film created an envelope around us -- the viewers -- as we watched a story on three parts.  These parts were that of the young boy, that of the same man as a teenage, and that of the same as a mature adult who returns to town thirty years later.  Once viewed, you must think about how your were manipulated by the director to actually be part of the film itself as you laughed at those in the film who emoted and cried, and yet at the end we, too, were that same audience.If you have a soul, and one that loves, and one that infinitely hangs onto past loves, or lost loves, or missed opportunities for a perfect love  --- this is your movie!",Cinema Paradiso

It is true that it would be easy to overlook the difficulties in a movie that's so lovable as Cinema Paradiso, but, although the film is wonderful in some respects, it maybe does not deserve the great praise we have heaped upon it.Cinema Paradiso focuses on a boy, Salvatore, who loves movies more than he loves his own life, which seems to be falling apart due to his father's absence and his mother's harshness. Salvatore also works as an altar boy, half-heartedly, though, because he always falls asleep on the job. Yet his friendship develops with Alfredo (played brilliantly by Philippe Noiret), who controls the film as it is displayed upon the screen in the tiny theater. Soon, Alfredo begins to teach Salvatore how to control the reels and the story develops further.The film does a great job of comparing the hopeful atmosphere brought on by film-watching to the hopelessness of a world without them. Both Salvatore's and Alfredo's characters do have a lot of depth, and it is a great joy to watch their characters develop. Also, Ennio and Andrea Morricone's music adds a great dramatic/romantic feel to the film, while Tornatore's direction is also very good. The story and screenplay are brilliant too: heart-breaking, involving, moving, and amusing all at once.However, two elements detract greatly from the film's resilience. One of these is the poor acting by young Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio). Although I have come not to expect much of anything from young actors, this performance just did more to make me think twice about seeing movies with much footage of children. The other element that takes something away from the film is the lack of focus during the first part of the film. I can understand that the action revolves around the movie theater, but the film at first seems to be a mere collage of scenes that take place at that location.Nevertheless, this film is very worth your time, because its highlights overshadow (for the most part) any difficulties. So, as you watch, be reminded of the magic of movies and their power to provide an escape, be it ever so temporary and imperfect.Final Grade: B+.",Cinema Paradiso

169,ruffinelli_ro,Very emotional,10,3 April 2009,"I can't remember the last time I watched a film like this one. Its strength comes from emotions instead of popular actors, big budgets, etc. I felt compelled to recommend this title since it is a unique movie that almost any one can relate to.The story is about friendship, one of the most important things in life. But unlike most movies about this matter, their connection felt genuine. Although this film is a little sad, it delivers other moments that are not. Just like friendship does. The main characters did a terrific job, and the photography helped also. Even if the movie is a bit long, it is still highly enjoyable. An absolute must watch for every single person that claims he/she knows about movies, and for everyone else also.",Cinema Paradiso
170,garrettderose,"Example of expert storytelling, and film making",10,29 July 2009,"Hmm, how do I start this? One thing I look for in a movie is depth. I like good character development and long drawn out backstories. Movies that excel in this usually don't have the quick pacing that keeps my attention. I've been looking for movies that have a sort of middle ground, you know, well roundedness.Upon reading the plot/synopsis, It was easy to say that I wasn't impressed. It didn't sound like a great subject, or something that'd keep my interest. But then again, I felt the same way about Shawshank Redemption. I was like ""What? A prison movie? Not even an action movie? Wth?"" ; and you know how Shawshank turned out.Cinema Paradiso is about a poor boy who lives with his mother and sister, his father KIA in 'the war'. The protagonist (boy) develops a relationship with a guy who works film projectors. He teaches the kid the ropes or projecting, and sneaks him into the projector room to watch all these classic movies for free. The movie goes through this father-son relationship over the span of 20+ years. This kid eats, breathes, and sleeps movies. His life's events, appropriately, mirror themes from classic movie story lines. Sounds like a bore, I know.This movie was made with care. The version I watched ran almost 3 hours. It felt like one of the LOTR movies in the fact that the length wasn't obstructed by dull long-and-drawn-out scenes. There was enough stuff going on, and enough layers to the story to keep me squirming in my seat.Well, there's a lot I'd like to say about this film - but i'll keep it short and sweet for your sake.If I were to make a top 10 movie list, this would be an easy addition.I'd like to think that I'm just as casual of a movie-goer as anybody else. This movie isn't some pretentious artsy flick that art school kids would boast as their favorite *cough ""Eraserhead!""*. It's easy to watch and has something for everybody. Lots of comedy, romance, drama, etc. I feel like the grandpa from Princess Bride when he's explaining the book.So yeah, I highly recommend this movie. I've yet to see a movie as full and resourceful. I know it'll be a long time before I find another like Cinema Paradiso.",Cinema Paradiso
171,Paul-250,A Hymn To Cinema,8,9 May 1999,"Cinema Paradiso is a film about growing-up as much as it is a homage to the cinema; the pains of growing-up, the compromises and, eventually, the separation that it involves from those we love and the familiar surroundings that have helped to shape us. And in a real sense, despite what Varlaam (in an earlier comment) said about 120 minute popcorn ads, it acknowledges the role of film as fantasy, a fantasy that cannot last. But what a beautiful fantasy! Anyone who knows Italy well will recognise the emotional warmth that permeates the film, and in that sense, like Fellini's Amarcord, the film is inescapably Italian. But it is also universal in it's acknowledgement of loss through the inevitability of change. This is a beautiful homage to cinema, but also to the ties of friendship and community that help people to develop as fully-rounded human beings. That we see little of what the townspeople do is not the point. We don't need to. One advantage of films like Cinema Paradiso and Belle Epoque is that they may encourage many people to watch subtitled films, and to appreciate that a film robbed of it's original language and sounds is a film castrated. To those unaccustomed to subtitles, that alone is a reason for seeing this wonderful film.",Cinema Paradiso
172,Andy_MJD,Nuovo Cinema Paradiso,8,4 February 2020,"A truly heart-wreching story about a boy growing up, and his lack of a father figure filled in by the old man who never has kids. I heard that in the extended version he meets back up with the love interest for one final night. I find this useless, if not in fact contradictory to the story: the point isn't about the boy and the girl. It's about the boy and the man. The love interest doesn't work out by the end of it, we know that since it's mentioned that he's with a different girl every time the mother calls. But frankly that wasn't why the movie was powerful. It was a great story, almost from the point of view of the town, since the boy leaves but we never know about any of his life (or very very little) outside of the town. What he does, what he likes, what part of town he lives in. Just like the old man, we shouldn't even want to know. It doesn't concern us. This is about a chapter in his life, that is opened, closed, and then reopened to be finally shut and finished.",Cinema Paradiso

175,silva-w-pius,A Italian classic,8,11 August 2013,"This heart warming and uplifting film takes us on a nostalgic adventure into our youths, through the innocent and untainted eyes of a young boy, who still sees the world for all its beauty and promise, even throughout the birth and death of a picture palace that holds so much lure and magic to him. Cinema paradiso is regarded as not only one of the greatest Italian films ever exported, but one of the greatest foreign films ever! But I would strongly disagree, as far as to say it is an insult to label this majestic testament to the beauty life, as just a foreign film! It's more than that, much more. A story told in flash backs, from the perspective of a highly successful film maker in his 40's (Salvatore Cascio). Upon receiving a call from his mother to inform him that his child hood hero had unfortunately died, it forces him to recount his entire youth. Telling the story of a young Salvatore living in a run down, poverty stricken and grim war-torn, post ww2 Sicilian village with his baby sister and his harassed mother who is as free with a slap as with a hug. But finding refuge from all the pain and misery, in a cinema paradiso, a local picture hall, provides him with an idyllic paradise where his love for cinema and adventures can run free. There he soon strikes up an unshakable life long bond with a aging projectionist, serving as a father figure and confidante, then after a fire robes him of his sight, Alfredo (Philippe Noriet) encourages Salvatore to take over at the new paradiso, but eventually he would push the now young 18 year old Salvatore, tainted by his first heartbreak by his true love Elena(Agnese Nano), out of the confines of this dead beat village, to a world waiting to be explored and conquered , Only returning 30 years later, to witness the burial of Alfredo and the demolition of the cinema paradiso. Giuseppe Tornatore provides us with a poignant and almost, spiritual reminder of how the simple things that we held so delicately in are youths can almost be forgotten and misplace in our older years, as we replace the magic with vain perceptions of success and obsession with money, when we should actually try and reconnect with our youths, and again enjoy the personal cinema experience that promises so much. As soon as the end titles rolled by, I couldn't help but feel sad, as a big cinema paradiso shaped whole was left in my heart. Cinema paradiso is a film that stirs up a lot of home truths, a great watch for brave individuals.",Cinema Paradiso
176,judemcrobbie,Memorably touching,9,2 March 2021,"One of the most touching movies so far. Many movies talk about obsession, usually in a negative light, however this places obsession on a pedestal showing it as a drive through life rather than how it pulls you down like others.
As with once upon a time in Hollywood (2019) this movie is a love letter to movies and how they have clearly affected the writer and director. No movie grasps this concept like this, making us adore the movies and see them as a separate character.
It gives you the warm and fuzzy feeling like it's a wonderful life (1946) but without the ending left up to chance it gives the movie space to grow in your mind.
The final scene is so beautifully crafted as it feels like the final act all summed up together in a beautiful bundle, which would or should bring any viewer to tears as it creates an impact on the audience undreamed of. On top of that it feels like a microcosm of the whole movie as it pulls elements from everywhere to create, what I'd deem, the perfect final scene.",Cinema Paradiso
177,NeelyO,Ultimately empty,3,15 September 1999,"Granted, I've only seen the US release version, which apparently chopped out quite a bit of footage, so this may be an unfair evaluation.  That said...There's an interesting *idea* for a movie here, but ultimately it's just not about anything.  The whole film is a flashback from a character we hardly know -- had we a better idea of who this guy was as an adult, then his formative childhood/adolescent experiences might mean something, but since he's a cipher, why should we care about how he got there?Even the much-lauded montage at the end (that's all I'll say about it) is kind of clumsy, and too-little too-late.  There's nothing more painful than *not* crying in the last reel of a tear-jerker, and that's how I felt at this film.  (And if someone like me fails to respond to a sentimental film about a person whose life was molded by the movies, trust me, something is very wrong.)I'd like to see Tornatore's original edit, though -- I may just be responding negatively to the chopped-by-Miramax version.

With the help of the local theatre projectionist, Alfredo, he is able to recognize his potential and move out into a wider world. But what keeps this film from simply being a sentimental ode to Italian cinema, is the reflection of a much older Toro coming to terms with the sacrifices he has made to become the man he is. Were they mistakes? Or are his past regrets still threatening to cloak his accomplishments as an individual?Despite a somewhat obtrusive score by Ennio Morriconne, this film sends a strong message about life reevaluation, and how past decisions can segue into the present, in often unexpected, but beautiful ways. A small gem of a film.",Cinema Paradiso
180,panchodh_12,One of *those* movies,10,24 July 2015,"I can't really think of many other movies that fit the same category as Cinema Paradiso. Right now I can only think of ""It's a wonderful life"" and ""Amelie"". But they are movies with a special spark. Movies that after the first few scenes you know that, regardless the development of the plot, you're now become completely involved with the story and the characters. You are *in* the story. It is often said that great movies are the ones that manage to convince the public that what they are seeing is reality, that the spell they cast is so well-carved that you don't notice that on the other side of the screen there's actors who leave their characters after the director shouts ""stop"", and people who work on the make-up, lightning, script. Great movies are those in which you forget that what you are watching a movie. Now, movies like Cinema Paradiso,, take it to a whole other level. It is not only that they make you believe you are watching reality, but that it's a reality deeply close to your heart. Two hours ago I'd never heard of Salvatore, Alfredo and Elena. But now they already seem like old-friends, people that know the purest of me, people that I don't want to believe that actually never existed, and were simply actors repeating the lines written by a guy. I actually want to believe they are somewhere in this real world. Movies like Cinema Paradiso completely blur the line between that side of the screen and us.It is therefore completely senseless that I spoke about the direction, the magnific editing, the outstanding performances and the touching music. Because that would mean to accept that Salvatore and Alfredo never existed, and I refuse to do that. At some point, Alfredo says that life is much worse than in the movies. But right now, after having just finished Cinema Paradiso, I want to believe it is not. I want to believe I am right now in that world where magic can happen, a world where, somewhere in Rome, Salvatore is kissing Elena.I don't usually cry in the movies. There have been some movies that do make me cry, though. Holocaust movies like La vita è bella are especially good at that. But most of the movies that make me cry are because they are particularly sad. Few movies have made me cry of happiness the way Cinema Paradiso did.",Cinema Paradiso

But really not noteworthy in any substantial way.There's a movie theatre that is obviously a set. There's a whole stable of stock characters and lots of forced emotion, but there's just no meat on the bones. And then there's all those questions unanswered.Why did little Toto (who's a really cute little kid) act out towards everyone, no matter how hard they tried to befriend him? Why did Toto's mother treat him so poorly and beat him so much? Why did Toto's father leave? Why did Toto's girlfriend leave? How could Toto be so much in love with a girl he didn't even know? What happened to his girlfriend? Why did he never come back to his hometown? Why did his life end up so apparently empty and unsatisfying? And there's more I haven't even touched on. All of those questions and no answers are even attempted for any of them.All there is is a token tearful scene here and there and a few oddball philosophical parables and the rest of the script is basically left blank.

183,quatermax-1,classic cinema analysing its own roots...,9,8 February 2008,"After 30 years of success in the big world, Salvatore, now a famous film director, is summoned back to the Sicilian village of his birth to attend the funeral of an old friend and mentor. Before his departure, in a series of poignant, very funny and genuinely tragic flashbacks, he reminisces about his life in the village, his family, his initial fascination and introduction to the wonders of film in his local 'flea-pit' cinema (the 'Cinema Paradiso' of the title), early friendships and life-lessons, and last but by no means least, a lost love.This is one of those films you hear made reference to many times and think, yeah, I must catch that one day. People who have seen it can't believe that you haven't, so you tell yourself again, yeah, I definitely must catch that one day. Unfortunately that day kept passing me by, but I now believe this was meant to be, for when I did finally catch it a week or so ago, it was a very different film than everybody had been going on about. I was invited by two ardent fans of the film to watch it with them and we opted to watch the Director's Cut, with a whopping 50 minutes plus of extra footage, which they had never seen. Normally when you see these boasts of extra footage, they tend not to make a great deal of difference to the end result (here I cite Dances With Wolves as a prime example). Not so with this little beauty. I sat watching absorbedly but also listening to the occasional gasp of 'that wasn't mentioned before', and 'they didn't tell you that in the other version' etc., etc., and apparently there's almost an entire third act reinstated which delivers several revelations about some of the main characters that adds a darker edge and considerably more depth to events depicted in the version released theatrically. My friends were unsure about this new/original version. I of course knew no other (apart from the large hints given by their commentary) and was entranced. The most enjoyable moments to me were the scenes with the child Salvatore (real name in fact Salvatore), or Toto as he is known in the village. A little acting marvel, his face truly lights up brighter than the cinema screen with which he is enraptured, and his scenes with Philippe Noiret as projectionist Alfredo are touching and magical without being overly sentimental (Spielberg could learn a lesson here). I could also have easily believed he would grow up to be the older Salvatore (French actor Jacques Perrin) who returns to the village. The adolescent Salvatore (Marco Leonardi) however bears no resemblance to these two whatsoever and, if I have a complaint, this is it, and so my disbelief was unsuspended for a while. This notwithstanding, the film is beautifully framed, lensed, and is enhanced immeasurably by an exquisite score by the Morricones which has become a favourite soundtrack for collectors. As with many of Morricone's scores it was composed based simply on the script and before any filming took place, so that the actors could perform and react to the music and tempos being played in the background of their scenes, a la theatre. According to Tornatore 'Some of the themes that are now in the film were composed right in front of me during those first few days. His music was an inspiration to everyone', whilst Morricone himself states 'The music was born of my collaboration with Giuseppe. It reflects how I was inspired by the story of a boy, in love with a beautiful woman and coming of age in a small town in Sicily. After reading the script I attempted to write music that would aid the film in its slow transformation from comedic and ironic to heavily dramatic'. He succeeded beautifully.The story goes that the original 1988 release received a poor reception with test audiences in Italy and producer Franco Cristaldi insisted, to director and writer Tornatore's displeasure, that cuts be made. But Tornatore, as a relative unknown, was indebted to Cristaldi and complied by coming up with a two hour version of his story, and it is this version which won the Cannes, Academy and Golden Globe accolades.Moments to watch for (and there are many) include Leopoldo Trieste's wonderfully measured performance as Father Adelfio, a fastidious local Priest who piously previews upcoming films to be shown at the early Cinema Paradiso, and who rings a bell as an indication to projectionist Alfredo as to which scenes are to be excised from future public screenings, invariably an on-screen kiss (or anything approaching it), and the powerful and emotional film dénouement where Salvatore receives and views his bequest from Alfredo  a reel of film containing all of these censored screen kisses. This is classic cinema analysing its own roots and its effects on its audience and I could go on and on about this rich, gorgeous and vibrant film, but I'll take a tip from my friends, who finally decided that less is more, and preferred the version they had originally seen, but with the reservation that the extra footage had thrown new light, and in one case a form of closure, on various relationships. Whichever version you choose to watch, which of course you can with this particular presentation, you are assured of viewing a great film (and I don't use that term loosely).",Cinema Paradiso

This is also a film about film, a genre which I've always found a bit too self-indulgent.Except I think this film – about the importance and magic of an actual cinema house – is one that is becoming more and more relevant today. People are going to the cinema less and less frequently – they're downloading films online, with poor quality, not paying, and, importantly, watching them on screens that are getting smaller – or at least thinner – in their own homes. What Cinema Paradiso reminds us of is the magic of leaving the house, paying for a ticket, sitting in a cinema with others, laughing together, being frightened together, getting choked up together.Nonetheless I still feel that this film is just a ""nice"" film – for the most part. It's perfectly pleasant and sweet, quite bittersweet in parts. Heartwarming, sure, but is that enough to make this film great? No. What makes this film immensely popular and well-loved, in my opinion, is the very last scene. It is surely among the most brilliant endings to a film I have ever seen. No spoilers here – but, for me, just because the final moments of a film are 10/10, this does not make the film 10/10.",Cinema Paradiso

If I had the cash I'd love to refurbish it to entice a new generation to what movies should be.I am glad I saw the ""shorter"" version.

It is sentimental, but it works without being mawkish. It is also nostalgic, but it is not a blinkered nostalgia. It does hint at darker things, and also a particularly traumatic moment which effects the entire tenor of the film after it happens. It is a beautifully judged film and there are scenes which are justifiably famous. In one of them the projectionist of the local cinema, turns the projector around so it can be seen on the walls of the outside town. It is a truly magnificent scene, albeit with a very dark ending.By setting the film in Sicily and basing it around the local cinema, as well as setting it after the second world war, the film explores poverty, censorship, and loss of community. It does all of the above in a poignant, and often wry way. I think the term masterpiece is a little overstated, although I can see why people think it deserves the accolade. The very moving scene at the end is a wonderful peon to friendship. I think the film is coy about some of the more dubious aspects of Sicily, but that really is a small gripe although I still think worth mentioning.It is a lovely film though with enough edge to restrain it from becoming too sentimental.

But then i checked about Cinema Paradiso and learnt there was a Director's Cut; and from what i read, the Director's Cut really gives a lot of sense to the last scene. The deleted parts really give content to the last message of Alfredo to Toto.
Finally, i believe the film was awarded because of the Director's Cut version, not the theatrical one.

I didn't looked it up on the internet, but I bet this story must have been very personal to Tornatore. Personal for the director but not only, every film lover will find this film a bit relatable. The film it's about love, love for cinema and above all it's about friendship. It's one of those rare films that will make you feel a ton of different emotions, but with an effortless grace it will never let you put your smile away from beginning to end.I loved everything about this movie, the cinematography, the production design, the music, everything, but above all I loved the storytelling. Tornatore does such a great job at putting you in perspective to the main character since the very beginning. He dictates the film with such passion that evokes real genuine emotions, using editing superbly well, as he did for example in the scene when Toto leaves. He cuts the scene exactly when Toto it's in the train looking at everybody he's leaving behind and immediately after that we see the airplane that it's bringing him back - the film it's full of perfect moments like this.A melancholic film, a bittersweet film, a film that is consistently funny and sad at parts. And that ending, it is amongst all the perfect moments of this film, the greatest one.",Cinema Paradiso
196,bahukhandishivam,Just left me numb !!!,10,28 November 2018,This is what a cinema means. Very few movies bring out one's emotions but this movie just floods them.

197,gga,A Masterpiece,10,12 April 1999,"What can I say about this movie?  It is one of the greatest jewels and homages of the cinema, both American and Italian.  Highly emotional and packing a punch at the end that won't leave you for several days, it is full of laughs all along the way.  The more you enjoy and love movies, the more significant this movie will be for you.  It is simply amazing that it is Tornatore's first film.  If Italians were wondering what would happen after Fellini's death, I would tell them to nurture this young filmmaker.",Cinema Paradiso

200,drgrozozo,mediocre,4,1 August 2007,"well i really wanted to like this movie, and i was ready for a treat. but unfortunately, it never came. movie starts promising, base for the story is laid down wide, and it looks like it will grow into a masterpiece. but it doesn't. phillipe noiret deserves recommendations for his role of alfredo and young salvatore cascio is nothing short of a brilliant in his role of salvatore as a child. other than that, everything is mediocre at best. story, while full of potential, is presented in an utterly corny and clichéd manner, acting is (besides those two honorable exceptions) amateurish and overplayed, and plot is (as expected) non-existent. filmed 4 years after ""once upon a time in America"", this flick at the moments resonates the great masterpiece, and i kinda expected old salvatore to look through projection booth while recalling his childhood :)while i can always swallow eternal-love type of story, this one is too shallow, too unfocused and watered. i haven't missed any of the movies messages, they are just too obvious and pathetic, and could appeal to me only if i was 18 again. for a 1988 movie that pretend to be something more, i find that inexcusable. there a tons of beautiful films, much older than this, dealing with same subjects in much more profound and original manner. this one settles with portraying love for art with endless clips of old movies, and shots of people watching them. for most passionate lovers of cinema and celluloid magic this might be a great movie as they can find their favorites in every clip featured. i personally don't like cinema as a whole nor it's ""magic"" nor do i respect every ""classic"". what i do like are good stories told in a good way, whether spoken, written or made into movies. and i don't like the way this one is told so i would probably give it 2 stars if there wasn't for legendary morricone that can singlehandedly elevate experience of every movie with the simplest of his tunes. watch and forget.",Cinema Paradiso

So I set my mind on completing the watch of the Top 100 of all time (the bottom of the list fluctuates too much in order for med to think it's worthwhile). Next stop: Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, at number 96 (it was there when I watched it anyway). Three HOURS later (except for Lord of The Rings, I have a very low tolerance for long movies), I just wanted to cry. That time is never coming back, and I spent it watching some depressing Italian movie, about a guy who gets some extra money when he's in his forte's (and by that time, it's too late to enjoy having a lot of money, as all we youngsters know), but never gets the love he wants.The only funny thing about this movie was that the Italian priest who works as a censurer at the Cinema Paradiso looks exactly like the orderly at the school where I work. I'm betting you don't work at a school with an orderly that looks exactly like the priest, and therefore I'm guessing you'll get NOTHING out of watching this film. So... I'm warning you to do so! 1 out of 10.PS. Many people go on about how beautiful and pitoresque the Sicilian setting is, but I just have to disagree with that.

A movie about movies cannot get any better than this masterpiece in every sense of word. Simple characters build around a theater only source of entertainment for people in a small province of Italy during WW II period, and a love story of main character first with movies, then with a girl, is simply beautiful, especially the passion of the kid with movies, is simply astounding. Another relationship depicted in the movie that of Toto and Alfredo is beautifully developed and equally well played by actors (3 played Toto, kid, young and mature old). The Kid artist who played Toto is amazing and played the role with equal panache as does the Alfredo. Other various artists are good in their roles, well suited. Music is very good and blends with every scene very well. Direction is superb and the photography too is top-notch, dialog's too are very well written. Watching crowd in the theater watching cinema is a pleasure moment for me as a viewer, it takes me back to old days when I use to enjoy a movie so much in theater, now its usually on TV, DVD, theater magic is not like that anymore. 10/10, must watch, irrespective of foreign language.

There is so much to unpack, especially in the nearly 3hrs long special edition, but I want to focus on the moral of the story.I think the main message was that Salvatore's sexual love for Elena was superficial and blinding to his true love for cinema, exhorting all of us to always be true to our identity. At the same time, Alfredo asks that we all leave our bird's nests because that's what growing up is all about. Nostalgia can be our enemy when it stifles our maturity, but in the end, childhood is often the time when we are truly happy.",Cinema Paradiso

I'm a young writer, and watching this film always fills me with the resolve to create a singular masterpiece that will unite every sensibility and belief I wish to espouse into a timeless whole: memories, comforts, desires, ideals. From the first frame it's clear that ""Cinema Paradiso"" is a deeply personal labor of love, and it deserves a spot on the cinematic landscape next to films like ""Gone With The Wind,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""8 1/ 2,"" and ""Schindler's List."" This film glows with passion and heart and is universally romantic (read: heterosexual men will be touched too, I think). It is a fitting tribute to a medium able to unify and diversify, repel and educate, entertain and enlighten. The final scenes are as moving and memorable as anything I've experienced, and that includes real events in my own life.",Cinema Paradiso

Cinema influences life and life influences cinema.This film feels like a dream, a beautiful dream. When you love cinema, seeing a film like this is just a truly magical experience. Just seeing a character's face lit up from the light of a cinema screen sends floods of nostalgia and emotion through you, it's so incredibly visceral even though technically not much is done at all. It's a sentimental story that speaks for itself and tells itself flawlessly. It really is engaging from start to finish, you go on a journey with the characters and hope everything turns out well for them, that's a basic requirement of any good film but with these characters you're invested in their lives' right from the get go. The beauty of cinema is a major stimulant to this film but along with that we also get a thoughtful coming of age story along with a lovely exploration into friendship and what we gain as well as lose throughout our lives'. The film-making is seamless with Morricone's breathtaking score, which as always matches the emotions of the narrative and the characters so perfectly. There are also multiple brilliantly framed shots which on their own have the ability to evoke so much emotion, let alone in the context of the film when we have already built such a strong connection to what we are watching.",Cinema Paradiso

I thought the cast was excellent, every performance touched on all the right points, the writing was superb, the main characters were well developedand I never knew would have thought that scraps of film put to together would make me cry. This was a film that I never wanted to end. It is a multi-layered love story and and really just a story about how life unfolds. The way that many things are brought up in the film casually and then used later for emotional impact is quite beautiful. I know some people are ""afraid"" of foreign films, but if you watch only one – make it this one. I highly recommend this film as an example of how meaningful films are constructed.",Cinema Paradiso

You can witness the art of finest storytelling of pure lives.The movie gave me some fresh air from the Tarantino, Hitchcock movies I've seen of often. The movie is filled with some delightful performances. I have no idea how a little boy's acting creates magic. He's too young for that, unreal talent. There are elegant characterisations even for artists having less SOT and have some best acting moments.The bond between Alfredo and Little Toto will be there lying on our hearts for years. As the story continues the wonder elements decreases. So do our attention. Projecting Cinema on the square was the best in the movie. Kisses played a major character in the movie.The viewers also grew with Toto. From the innocent little kid who loves cinema as well as Alfredo; to a young adult, who's deep love for cinema shifts to a girl; to the grownup old man who had achieved his dream for cinema making, yet unfulfilled with his love of life.

I share the lives of Toto and Alfredo, the small Sicilian boy, who loses his father in the second world war, and the older man who runs the projector at the local cinema. Toto lives in a world of make believe, movies, adventure. His dreams take him away from the small Sicilian village where he lives with his mother and sister. Alfredo becomes for him a surrogate father, and the movies, his paralell existence. It is a deceptively simple film, which sweeps you up and carries you along. You never want it to end. And, when it does end, it is with such heartbreaking simplicity, I cannot help being moved to tears. Young Salvatore Cascio is a marvel as the small Toto, a mischievous, impish, adorable child. Phillipe Noiret is unforgettable as the sly and heart-warming Alfredo. You grow up with Toto, until he becomes a famous film director in Rome, and returns to the small village after many years for Alfredo's funeral. It is the story of life, lost love, devotion, friendship, and family. It is unforgettable.",Cinema Paradiso
224,petereviews,Movie Magic,9,11 July 2021,"THE PROS: Part ode to the magic of the movie theatre and part a coming of age film, this film is a must-watch. While the comedy and mentor-like bond between the grandfatherly Alfredo and young Salvatore are easily the highlights, this movie goes above and beyond in creating a unique world full of memorable background characters and details in the quaint little village of Giancaldo.Honestly not much else to say... if you are a film buff, just watch it.THE CONS: Nothing really... my only small quibble is that the ending tries to be a tad too sentimental for my tastes and didn't hit me like I think the movie intended to. That being said, that was a personal taste thing and I did like the subtle building theme of changing times throughout the movie.FINAL VERDICT: It is crazy to me that a film in 1989 was already indirectly predicting the rise of streaming and the argument of whether theatres are still relevant. Cinema Paradiso, however, builds a strong case and reminder of how magical the movie theatre experience was, is, and will be in the future. With COVID having shut down theatres for so long, I can't think of a better movie to recommend checking out before you go to the theatres again and reminding yourself of why it's so special. Highly recommended.",Cinema Paradiso

227,lloydbowman,10/10 One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,10,5 May 2020,"I don't easily offer superlatives such as ""best of"" for very many things. Obviously, films are a matter of taste, but by my standards ""Cinema Paradiso"" is as about as close to perfect as a film can become. I will not, nor dare I, try to argue its superiority on technical merit. Rather, it is a film, which given your time and attention, will touch and become a part of your heart and soul as few films can. It is a film that left me feeling as though I had not really seen a movie before, that after seeing this film it was like being given a new sense or the ability to see a color you never knew existed. It is perhaps one of the finest examples of what a truly great motion picture can be.""Cinéma Paradiso"" is about a boy, who becomes a young man and a man who is the projectionist in the titular village movie house and, of course, a girl set in a Sicilian village in the years following the Second World War. That's the setting and those are the primary characters, but the story is about about human life - birth, childhood, maturation, death, loss, passion, growth and, of course, love in its many forms - fraternal love, erotic love, paternal love. Finally, it is about film and movies themselves, but to say any more is to give too much away.The remarkable, poignant film score by Ennio Morricone is an integral and irreplaceable part of the fabric of the film so that decades after having seen the movie, merely hearing the film's main theme will cause tears to involuntarily fill my eyes. That is how powerful an emotional ""muscle memory"" this film has etched into my heart.If you have the opportunity, see the second edition editor's cut that was released In 2002, I believe. Apparently, the film's pre-release 1988 length was long so it was significantly reduced (by about a full hour, I believe) to make it more marketable. Watching that edited original 1988 theatrical release will still give you the critical experience and magic of the film, as it certainly did me and its original audience, but you will find the longer, complete story more satisfying, deeper, fuller ans more rounded and a lot of the questions that the original screen audiences were left with will be answered.I fear after saying all of this that I will create too high of an expectation in a potential viewer. Instead, I'd advise you you forget everything I've said, and simply view the film on its and your own terms and let it unfold for you. You'll never forget it.10/10",Cinema Paradiso

231,thepetshopboy,My all-time favorite,10,18 December 1998,"The most gratifying piece of film making I have ever seen, ""Paradiso"" is one of the few films that I can watch time and again.  Director Tornatore brings a passion to the film which seeps out of every frame and invites the viewer to revisit their youth, their hopes, their dreams and the crushing truth of reality.  You will not see a more beautiful, haunting film than this. Phillipe Noiret gives the performance of his life (one which he played a subtle riff on in "" Il Postino"") and Ennio Morricone's score ranks right up there as his best.  For true junkies like myself I would highly recommend getting a hold of the director's cut in which an additional 50 minutes of material is added.  While as a whole it is not as good a movie (Tornatore clearly needed a forceful editor) it does provide insight into what happeneed to Toto's beloved Elena and surprises viewers with a heart-wrenching plot twist which was cut from the original.",Cinema Paradiso

The plot, beside the originality, is not specially good and develops very slow. Sadness is always present. But... The timing is awful. No reason for such a long movie. They are no stuff to maintain your attention during 3 hours. It could be much better if a Director Cut put it to 100 minutes, no more. Its boring.

235,Merkin4pres64,"One Word: ""Beautiful""",10,22 July 2007,"Guiseppe Tornatore's 1988 foreign language classic ""Cinema Paradiso"" reigns in my mind to be the finest film ever made. The movie itself is a love story to cinema while serving as a memory of a time when going to the movies was a big deal. The film offers a collection of memorable characters of the Sicilian town of Giancaldo while focusing mainly on the relationship of theater projectionist Alfredo and Salvatore whom he calls Toto.The film opens with Salvatore learning Alfredo has died. He begins to reminisce about him and we are introduced to a nine year old Toto, being something of a thorn in Alfredo's side at the theater when he visits the projectionist booth during the town priest's regular screenings to cut out objectionable material, which just so happens to be any form of kissing. Here, Toto and Alfredo's relationship begins and later expands to a point when the nine year old learns to project. Having been surrounded by movies for a good portion of his life, Alfredo, being the Dumbledore to Harry, the Gandalf to Frodo, instills his wisdom into Toto using the movies- quoting American legends. When a tragedy leaves Alfredo blind the theater destroyed, Toto becomes the new projectionist when the ""nuovo Cinema paradiso"" opens.The film transitions to a 18 or 19 year old Salvatore, still called Toto by some of the townspeople. Alfredo is still there, but has stepped back from the projection booth, and instead becomes Toto's mentor. When Toto falls in love with Elena, in what becomes the most beautiful love story ever told on screen, Alfredo guides Salvatore in his effort to conquer her heart. The love story unfolds gracefully and becomes a pleasure to be engrossed in, but it ends abruptly and mysteriously. In the director's cut, it is learned the relationship was ended by a third party, in what he considered to be an act of love for Toto. Soon after, Toto leaves for Rome with advice from Alfredo to never come back and that if he does, not to visit him, he won't let him in. The film transitions to the third act after this.We find out Salvatore is now a famous film director and has come back to Giancaldo for the first time in 30 years for the funeral. During his visit, he finds out the Cinema Paradiso is to be demolished in a couple of days to make way for a new parking lot, almost as if the upcoming demolition was the last nail in Alfredo's coffin. After the funeral, Mr. Da Vita, as he is now called by the townspeople except for his mother, sister, former boss, and Signora Anna, at his insistence, he visits Signora Anna, Alfredo's widow who reveals to him that Alfredo loved him as a son and was very proud of his accomplishments. There, she gives him a film reel from Alfredo.In the final scene in what is presumed to be his screening room, Salvatore asks his projectionist to load the film and play it. In one of the most memorable montages in film history, Toto discovers the film is a compilation of all the ""obscene"" kissing Alfredo was forced to cut from the movies when he was the projectionist. Salvatore sits there, in his seat, tears streaming down his face, and realizes this to be the most profound act of love he has ever seen. The reel finished with a ""Fine"" and the credits start to roll, ending the finest film ever made.My props go to Tornatore for his excellent direction, particularly notable in the theater scenes. His screenplay manages to honor the movies with sentimentality, but he doesn't overdo it- it never becomes sappy and melodramatic. But my highest praise goes to legendary composer Ennio Morricone for what is the greatest score ever written. The music is able to instill in the viewers senses of pain, love, happiness, and every other emotion one is to feel throughout this movie.",Cinema Paradiso
236,euplay1220,"Supposedly moving, but unconvincing (yet)",6,11 April 2016,"It seems there are twos aspects of this film that appeal to many people's emotions.1) Nostalgia: After thirty years of time during which Toto kept himself physically and mentally away from home, it is understandable that the memories from the distant past flood into Toto, although personally I did not feel particularly nostalgic by watching that.2) Love: According to many, the ending is meant to fill Toto with love he lost, but this interpretation is not plausible because it refers to different kinds of love. After his loss of relationship with Elena, Toto left home and had relationships with many women in search for a better heterosexual love, while the ending scene only means Alfredo's paternal love. These two are qualitatively different; the latter kind of love cannot be taken to compensate for the missing former. Considering the special emotional attachment given by Toto to Elena, it is implausible that Toto finds any true love with any other woman, which is precisely why he has had many relationships ever since he lost Elena. An interpretation of the ending scene as a demonstration of the former (heterosexual) kind of love is also implausible, because it is only a film projected on the screen, not real for Toto himself. In a shorter version of this film at least, therefore, Toto is left with Alfredo's enduring paternal love but without heterosexual love with a woman. This aspect is incomplete.These two aspects were emotionally not convincing to me. Perhaps all I need to appreciate its true value is a couple of more decades of life experience, long enough to look far back into the past and be nostalgic. For the time being, 6 out of 10.",Cinema Paradiso
237,Megabuck,Wonderful homage to old-fashioned cinema,9,25 August 1999,"The Motion Picture Academy got it thoroughly wrong. Cinema Paradiso should NOT have won the Oscar(tm) for best foreign picture; in fact, it should not even have been nominated for it.That's because this beautiful, warm, funny and heartbreaking film should really have been up there in the Best Picture category. Whether it could have beaten Driving Miss Daisy, or My Left Foot, or any of the others, is a moot point - but to relegate a film as wonderful as this one to a 'lesser' category, simply because the dialogue isn't in English, ought to be unacceptable.The story centres around one boy, but is really all about a love affair with the cinema. As such, the two main characters are Alfredo, the outwardly gruff man who runs the local picture house, and Toto, the little boy who works his way into Alfredo's affections. Both of them love the cinema, and there are many wonderful scenes inside the palace, which is clearly one of the main focal points of town life.There's not much plot - the by grows older, falls in love (which goes unrequited), goes away to do his stint in the military, and eventually moves away and becomes a successful businessman. He returns for Alfredo's funeral, and the whole film is one long reminiscence.But reducing this film to a precis of the plot is to do it a disservice. This was clearly a labour of love, and it has resulted in a remarkable film. The casting and acting is as near perfect as you could ask for; the ending is so funny and so meaningful it moves me to tears each time I watch. This is a film where you care deeply for the central characters, and even the picture house itself.I couldn't imagine watching a dubbed version of this; I don't speak Italian, but I think it would ruin much of the film's atmosphere. Please, if you get the chance, see this film - but only with subtitles!",Cinema Paradiso

240,vjeet_a,A beautiful story,10,22 August 2005,"I probably don't have words to describe what happened to me after having seen both versions of the movie. I was taken away so much. I wept and was real sad for a while. This movie is a closest thing to the perfection in movie making art. A beautiful story, perfect direction and acting. I loved the script so much. Lot of people differ on their opinion about original version Vs. shorter version. I watched both of them and I just want to say that their is no point in watching shorter version after all you have to see longer version anyway because you don't want to miss out even a bit of what this movie is about. The last conversation with grown up Toto and his old mother made me wept and it was so real and genuine it sends shivering in me. A movie has everything in it, Toto's kid life story that has school life, street life, home life and social life and as an adolescent everything around him has been shown and of course the grown up Toto is just awesome. Alfredo is another character in the movie who is so impressive and real. One thing I liked about the movie is that director has done a marvelously job of keeping thing connected. Every little scene has its impact on the movie. There are no vague things. Movie is bit sad and sentimental in the end but in a beautiful way, no killings or rape or poverty kind of stuff. A rare natural sadness that emerges automatically, we don't see this thing in movies very often.Little events in the movie are shown so beautifully, like the one -when Toto's collections of films (he stole from Alfredo's place) catches fire and his mother is trying to put it off to also consoling her little daughter- was so well done and directed. The movie is full of details and goes very smoothly and you will never want it to end.Even if you hate watching movies, watch this one. Steal money to rent this movie if you need to. You will never forget this movie for your life time.-Vishy",Cinema Paradiso
241,reddevil_42,Paradise,9,14 March 2013,"Cinema Paradiso is one of my favourite movies. It left me working out if Alfredo was right to do what he did. I watched the released version first and even though I could discern some large plots of the movie missing, it had just the right amount of information for you to fill the rest up. With the director's cut, Alfredo's character is portrayed in much more negative light. Either ways, he is vindicated by the final scene of the movie, which is one of the best I have seen. Just as Salvatore began to ponder on the What-ifs, came this montage of the cut out kissing scenes reminding him of his first and biggest love, the Movies. Portrayal of a young Salvatore, madly in love with the movies and Alfredo's company, is both innocent and charming. The teenage Salvatore, who falls in love with a blue eyed girl and attempts to woo her, has also been very well played. While many meanings lie beneath the scene where the Paradiso finally falls, the one that comes across strongest is that echoed by Alfredo. While attachment to loved ones and feeling nostalgic to one's home and past is natural, it takes true love and devotion to pursue one's passions and calling in life and achieve success. While this 'Sacrifice love for true passion' expression might not resonate with some, it is much easier to understand why Alfredo acted in the manner that he did. He knew that Salvatore had great potential and could go on to do great things in life but at the same time, his attachment to things would always peg him back and restrain him from exploring the possibilities that lied far from home. The two scenes when Salavatore cries are the ones when he sees his love on the projector and the montage at the end. He realizes that the sacrifice had to be made for him to be where he was and was grateful for that.",Cinema Paradiso
242,SCManCA,One of the most beautiful movies of all time,10,10 February 2020,"Sitting down and watching this masterpiece again, what a treat.It's hard to believe this movie came out over 30 years ago. But, oh how it resonates. Even today. It is now deemed an older movie, but it is still deserving of the praise and adulation it received when it was released.It melds this incredible sense of beauty, romance, drama, and wit into an almost aesthetically perfect cinematic tour de force.And the performances bring it to life in a most magical and captivating way. It is absolutely enchanting and makes me want to go out and fall in love all over again.Not only does this gem pay homage to the romance of times gone by, but it keeps the romance alive, even today. Every time you watch it.It's a movie about movies at its most foundational level. But it's so much more. It shows us what a film can bring to our lives. What it can teach us about humanity. And how it, quite simply, makes us feel.As I watched this again, I am very surprised that the young men playing both Salvatore as a child and as a young man didn't do more. Unless they have made their mark in other countries to levels of which I'm unaware.Salvatore Cascio....what an amazing performance by that young man. I'm surprised he didn't win more than a BAFTA.And Marco Leonardi....talk about beauty personified. Whenever his countenance graced the screen it took your breath away. Where did he go, and why didn't he become the matinee idol to parallel the successes of Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp, et. al. Such a handsome young man, and a wonderful actor.Thank you, Italy, and thank you Giuseppe Tornatore for bringing us this artistic treasure.",Cinema Paradiso

244,leeloo67,Monkey Wrench,2,12 April 2003,"This comment contains spoilers.  I really like foreign films.  For a long while in my movie watching career, I thought just the ""good ones"" made it over to the U.S.  Cinema Paradiso has thrown a monkey wrench into my theory.  This is a terrible movie with bizarre events that make no sense, even in an artsy way.  Part of it might be my hatred for ""the life of"" movies, where some terrible child actor plays the first 1/3, another actor plays the adult, and another actor plays the ""old man"" at the end.  As a side note, I have an extreme hatred for the ""old man makeup"" trick (Like in ""A Beautiful Mind""), which is ALWAYS distracting - much more distracting than the changing actors trick.  Part of it might be the fact there are too many moviehouse scenes.  Part of it was the bizarre contrived sentimentality the filmakers tried to force into the movie with the old projectionist character, especially towards the end.I really wanted to be pretentious and like yet another foreign film, but I couldn't even pretend on this one.  There was one very very cool scene that was so out of place, it felt like I was watching a different movie (the scene with the mirror and the projector).  Oddly enough, about a week after seeing this one, I saw a similar film that was far superior to this one:  ""La Lengua de las Mariposas"".  Search for it on IMDB.com, watch it, and compare.  The acting done by the child is the best I have ever seen, especially at the end.  It has the unforced dynamic the filmakers in ""Cinema Paradiso"" were trying for.  ""Cinema Paradiso"" has taught me one important thing: bad movies don't just come from Hollywood.",Cinema Paradiso
245,dmayo-911-597432,Charming details don't add up to a great film,6,14 September 2013,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***It would be best to see this film without knowing how warmly it was welcomed by critics and viewers at the time, or how many people still take it to their hearts. It does hold many charms in its details, but when it tries to give us a story of Life and Love it becomes banal and contrived. It also takes an oddly careless approach to the aging of its characters.Nuovo Cinema Paradiso opens with a framing story in which a middle-aged man hears that someone named Alfredo has died in his hometown and begins recalling his childhood. In the flashbacks that form the main body of the film, the setting is a town in Sicily in the decade following World War II. A small boy is irresistibly drawn to the local cinema, a world of enchantment, and to its projection booth, the heart of that world. He befriends the projectionist, Alfredo. Alfredo discourages the boy, Toto, from following in his footsteps as a projectionist and eventually encourages him to pursue his love of movies on a grander scale. We're soon prepared to learn that the grown Toto who is recollecting these things has become a famous director.In the first phase of the flashbacks, we follow little Toto in his childish peccadilloes while following the community in its avid response to movie magic (a funny exception being the gritty social realism of post-war Italian cinema, which proves as impenetrable to Sicilians as to much of the world beyond). This phase ends with the cinema destroyed by fire and Alfredo rescued by Toto but blinded for life.The Toto of the second phase is apparently in his late teens, perhaps twenty by the end of the flashback. Childish peccadilloes have given way to amateur film-making, running the projector at the rebuilt cinema, and love at first sight with a girl whose social position poses an obstacle -- in effect, a princess. As always, the life of the community and that of the film are centered on the shared joys of escape in a darkened cinema. Toto's personal life is disrupted by a period of military training, after which he finds that he can't pick up where he left off. He loses touch with Elena, his love, who has moved away. Finally, he takes Alfredo's advice and leaves town himself to make his way in the world.Very well, but it's unbelievable that he then absolutely neglects his mother for thirty years, even to the point of not returning her phone calls, although they were on good terms when he left. The only reason seems to be that the film requires a complete break with home so that the middle-aged Toto can feel he's stepping into a past world when he returns for Alfredo's funeral. Still more unbelievable is the casting of characters at different ages. The twentyish Toto is distinctly short, but the fiftyish Toto towers over everyone else in the funeral procession. Conversely, his mother changes from a tall young woman to a tiny old one. Then there is the aging of characters who are played by the same actors throughout. Alfredo's wife, who was middle-aged in the first place, only turns gray-haired and gray-faced while the transformation (by casting) of Toto's younger mother rivals that of the queen in Snow White. Indeed, slapping gray paint on actors -- while removing an obvious hairpiece from one -- is all the movie magic Tornatore offers in the framing story. Is he trying to tell us that he has decided to wash his hands of film-making as a labor of love?The many delightful moments in Nuovo Cinema Paradiso are really just so many vignettes strung together in the abrupt, sometimes bewildering manner of the 1980s. To the extent that these moments achieve a unified effect, they suggest the benign human comedy of Rene Clair. Yet they are mixed with stink-bombs of bad taste that would have puzzled Clair as to this director's intent. That, too, is a mark of the 1980s.It may be best to look for the appeal of this film in the ways in which it differs from most other films of the 1980s and many since. It does come down on the side of benign human comedy. It does cherish the magic of Golden Age film-making, even as that magic slips through its fingers. It does become an oasis of entertainment if you come upon it in a personal desert of dissatisfaction with films generally. The trouble is that if you have had the good fortune to drink from the springs of Rene Clair and other masters, Nuovo Cinema Paradiso turns out to be a mirage.",Cinema Paradiso
246,chrysdtl,...what influenced you as a kid?,8,9 May 2005,"This movie made me cry because it managed to arouse powerful feelings and thoughts about life - the things you learn from it, the people that have an impact on you, the experiences that build you as a person and the way you understand to live it. Toto, the boy fascinated with the cinema and the old man Alfredo, that shows him around the cinema's secrets at it's beginnings, make a wonderful example of friendship. They help each other, learn from each other, laugh together and enjoy life at its fullest through that one thing that connected them in the first place - the cinema. Italian movies have a roughness and a freshness that make them real, away from clichés and well designed everything as the American movies thought us it should be. This film reminded me of ""La vita e bella"" with Roberto Begnini, where another boy discovers life (and stays alive) being influenced by a grown up.

I won't give anything away, but this may be the most perfect film made for anyone who has ever truly loved film.  The young boy is so amazing, that I was sad as he gets older.  The teen age boy was so caring that I cried when he grew older.  I thought I would hate what he had become but the final scene I felt like I was sitting crying with him.  I once worked in an old movie theater, and I found myself at times finding secret places within it, where things had been hidden or stored.  It was a magical place.  I felt like Toto that this was the greatest place in the world.  I had forgot how much I loved it, until I saw this movie.  One of the greatest films ever made.",Cinema Paradiso
248,Doriano,Sometimes less is more: Don't watch the uncut version first!,10,2 November 2003,"Spoiler warning for anyone who hasn't seen this classic yet...ok? Don't read this review if you haven't seen at least one version of Cinema Paradiso.First of all, I was born in Italy, so I was extremely proud when Cinema Paradiso won the Oscar for best foreign film as well as the hearts of all movie goers when it was released. Also, I am a hopeless romantic who absolutely adores movies! So this movie was right up my alley on many levels!I saw the shorter version as most of us did when it came out in the US, and only recently saw the full uncut Director's version.  It is one of my all-time favorite movies ever--and still is--but I must admit that I did not experience near the same magic or euphoria that the shorter original version gave me many moons ago! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the extra 51 minutes because I wanted MORE of a great thing, but as the old saying goes, sometimes less is more! Nothing, I repeat, nothing can match the power of the imagination and thus there in lies the magic and the power of the shorter version! By cutting out the extra scenes, we, the audience, were all left up to our own devices and forced to fill in the blanks ourselves with our imagination and our heart! By seeing everything the way we do in the full blown version, well, despite how sweet it was, it left something to be desired. I enjoyed the reunion (al though the whole flashing light effect grew VERY tiresome after awhile) but I could have done without it.Also, the thing that has been eating away at me is the whole question about why in the world Alfredo would (or could!) interfere with his supposed adopted son's first true love! Sure, I've been trying to come up with angles and reasons for his insanely cruel action, but nothing will convince me that the writer/director simply screwed up and should not have made the character do such a dastardly deed! Period! I loved the whole notion that he loved his ""son"" so much that he forced him to leave town and made him promise never to come back again...because we all knew that Alfredo was right...the only way Toto was going to achieve his dream was by leaving their small town and son of a gun if Fredo wasn't right! However....for him to be the main reason for the breakup of Toto's great love spoils the whole story. I will never watch this version again. I bought the DVD and pray that the original shorter verson that I saw and fell in love with is on the DVD!!!P.S. Some of my all-time favorite scenes come from this movie: The kiss in the rain (which is the cover on the DVD!) The dialogue where Alfredo tells Toto ""I don't want to hear you talk anymore. I want to hear people talking about you!"" The montague at the end of all the kisses and censored scenes. The haunting images of Elena on Toto's little movie projector...",Cinema Paradiso
249,vwild,Paradise Lost - Cinema Paradiso is overshadowed by film classics it celebrates,6,11 January 2017,"The films of the golden era of Italian cinema breathe life into the first half of Cinema Paradiso. Without them the film is a soulless affair with no sense of reality or place. It is a tourist trip to a fantasy Sicily of the 1940s and 50s decked out in nostalgic glowing colours and accompanied by nauseatingly sweet and persistent music. However, for the first hour or so we get to imagine the impact of legends of the silver screen on small town, post-war life and this is diverting enough.The first film we watch being watched at Cinema Paradiso (the picture house that gives the film its title) is the 1930s classic The Lower Depths starring Jean Gabin at the height of his doomed, working class glamour. The priest (a welcome appearance by Leopoldo Trieste) is censoring the film for the community. He rings a bell and Alfredo, the projectionist, slots a scrap of paper into the reel on the projector to remind him what to slice out later – usually kissing. Also in the background is Toto, a kid who will become Alfredo's assistant, and whose memories we are viewing from thirty years into the future. More films follow and the village audience's uninhibited reactions are depicted through the years. We get John Wayne in Stagecoach and the children whoop like ""Red Indians."" We get a Matarazzo melodrama and the whole audience weeps. We get a Totò movie and they are fighting to see it over and over again. A host of great stars flicker beguilingly in the background of this story – Silvana Mangano, Vittorio Gassman, Vittorio de Sica, Brigitte Bardot, Alberto Sordi, Kirk Douglas – and they bring star power to Cinema Paradiso. Without them we have a rather tired tale. Toto, the kid projectionist, grows up to be a famous film director. The death of Alfredo, his surrogate father and friend, brings back memories of his childhood and youth spent at the cinema in Sicily. He returns to his home town for the first time in thirty years to relive memories of lost teen romance and to bury his friend. Cinema Paradiso is deeply impregnated with nostalgia and sentimentality, but is lacking in genuine emotion. It's kitsch. The characters are oddly blank and lacking inner life. It's difficult to feel anything when Alfredo is blinded in a projector fire, when mother finally hears that papa has died in Russia, when teen Toto loses his first love, despite the constantly hectoring soundtrack. The dialogue is leaden (particular mention should be made of the hackneyed folk ""wisdom"" dished out by Alfredo) and the film has no sense of time or place. For the most part the old movies shown at the cinema distract us from these faults, but sometimes they highlight them. In the late 40s the Neo-Realist classic la Terra Trema comes to Cinema Paradiso. The power of the Neo-Realist films was that the audience saw their own lives on the screen, but the Sicily of La Terra Trema and that of Cinema Paradiso are vastly different. Visconti attempts to depict the real, savage poverty of the Sicilian fishermen using non- professional actors. He shows us the life and culture of the community. He even shows us how the economic structures are fixed against working people. The Sicily of Cinema Paradiso is like a theme park by comparison, a glowingly quaint town peopled by lovable Italian types in a mythical past. It looks like a nice place for a holiday. The theme park Italians of Cinema Paradiso are disturbingly unmoved by seeing La Terra Trema. For the viewer, the contrast between the two films' visions of 1940s Sicily is a jolting reminder of Cinema Paradiso's hollowness.Having seen the ""Director's Cut"" of Cinema Paradiso it is easy to see why the producers hacked away at the film and reissued it. An hour or so in we leave Toto's memories of the 1950s and the old film classics behind and jump to the present day. Without their glamour Cinema Paradiso finally has to stand on its own merits and we are left with a turgid soap opera. Time would be better spent watching the Italian classics that Cinema Paradiso celebrates than with Cinema Paradiso itself.",Cinema Paradiso

The movie surpassed all my expectations and was a treat to watch. I guess, there is something about the Italian cinema that truly fascinates me. Especially the movies that deal with the people of small towns, going about there lives in a lazy manner. I guess it may have to do with the fact that we live in a very fast and noisy world and probably find our escapes in the movies. I would love to trade my position (I am sure many of us would) with these simple people of the last century, living their simple lives, laughing, chatting, playing guitar....Well, coming back to the movie, it is based on a beautiful relationship between an old man (Alfredo) and a small boy (Toto). Alfredo is the cinema-keeper in a small Italian town theater. Toto is his friend and keeps coming to his place quite often. Toto is besotted with movies. Their friendship deepens after an incident in which Toto saves Alfredo's life. Alfredo looses his eyesight, and Toto, the only other person in the town who knows how to operate the projector, gets his job. Toto grows older, falls in love, and the drama continues...The movie is actually in a flashback mode, where Toto has grown up to become a very successful movie director. And he starts thinking about his past life when he comes to know that Alfredo is no more.The Story line is simple yet holds your attention, excellent camera work (the images captured are wonderful), good direction and melodious background score.

But besides that, my Grandpa loves movies, and when I see Salvatore falling in love with them it makes me think that my gradpa was a ""real life Salvatore"" when he was a kid.
The relation between Salvatore and Alfredo was the other thing I liked the most, that was true friendship. The love for the cinema that both of them had, made that friendship stronger even though the age difference. Also, Alfredo was a fatherly figure for young Salvatore and always wanted the best for him, even if that meant no seeing him never again (Although that was a bit exaggerated, Salvatore could have go to visit once in a while)

It tells several stories. First and foremost portrays the magic of Cinema, which is one of the cheapest entertainers. With advent of television, fall of Cinema. Human story is about a fatherless boy who develops an attachment to a projectionist who becomes his father figure and helps building his character. There is a love story of first love. I find this story is a Morden transformation of a fairy tale with immense presence of reality. The projectionist Alfredo's character is that of a wise man, who does not demand anything of Toto, but continually feels him with signpost. Amazingly he does not demand to see Toto before he dies. I am now keen to see extended version, which may have expansion in love story. If you have not seen this film, I thoroughly recommend it.",Cinema Paradiso

It's a movie about nostalgia, reality of life, and about the importance of relationships we develop during our early days. It happens in a small town. As I was born and brought up in a small village I can relate to every aspect of this movie. It talks about love, sex, tenderness, comedy, disappointments and achievements. A must watch for everyone with a heart. The characters, the story, the direction, story telling and casting are just amazing. The actors did a wonderful job. It is a movie where the characters foresee what's going to happen. It's a movie with so many different levels. Simply breathtaking.

Music, setting, plot, characters, and of course the movies meld seamlessly into one to create a masterpiece.  I bawled my eyes out like a little girl the first time I saw this.  The scene with the reflecting projector and the very end are so simple yet so beautifully sweet and touching.  This movie makes the guy from American Beauty who thought everything was so beautiful look like a gothic junkie.  Anyone who believes there is beauty in cinema should watch this movie.

262,randeclip-1,Go and watch this now!,10,16 January 2006,"What criticism can I give this movie? Was it overly sentimental? It was the sentimentality that made this such a fine film. The character ""Alfredo"" says it best when saying goodbye to the young Salvador, ""Don't give into nostalgia."" The film is about what is lost in time. It's about coming home again. The Italian film Cinema Paradiso is about the life of a Fellini-esc movie director who must return to his home village after leaving thirty years prior. The film is told from his perspective with memories and flashbacks of his time as a young boy and through his teenage years. What is most remarkable about this film is that in his years away from his home village, the world he new so well (and one that I think he expected to be identical to his memories) has changed so dramatically. The movie house, The Cinema Paradiso, once the center of the village and where he first found his love for film and met his friend (and surrogate father) Alfredo, is now no more then an afterthought. Nothing more then a forgotten ruin waiting for the wrecking ball. It is as if with the death of Alfredo, his link with the past is cut for good; only to leave the now grown up ""Toto"" truly alone.The first time I saw this movie my feelings were that it was good and entertaining but otherwise unremarkable. Then came THE END....In the center of the world that is Rome we find the great ""Director Salvador De Vita"", busy at work. Almost as an afterthought he hands over an old, worn out film reel left for him by his dead friend ""Alfredo"" to view. With this the film is catapulted into greatness.This film, if not for anything else, is interesting to watch. We see a portrayal of an Italian village and lifestyle as it was. It was a closed world that relied on itself for life, religion, news, and entertainment. The world today with its cheap and easy transportation and mass communication makes ""Toto's"" meager village more of a suburb of the global world. Lost is the community of ""Alfredo"", and with him is lost a simpler way of life for us all.",Cinema Paradiso
263,zhenca,A cinematic wonder that will put you under the spell!,10,15 May 2005,"If you are not yet infatuated with movies, this dazzling masterpiece will definitely sweep you off your feet, and who knows, perhaps, imbue you with love for the art of film for the rest of your life. Yes, yes, yes! The cinema paradise will play the same trick on you as it did on Salvatore, the main character, grabbing you and never letting you go.My own crush on movies grew into a strong and staunch feeling, the one that a seasoned admirer might have for an object of his long-time affection despite some random disappointments (e.g., Star Wars series). Nuovo Cinema Paradiso proved to me anew that your ""watching"" efforts of a loyal and a patient film viewer will always be rewarded with such cinematic gems, coming out now and then not from the cinematographer's vanity or greed, but from his heart.Incidentally, this cinematic paradise reminded me of another heavenly creative piece by Giuseppe Tornatore, - his newer film ""La Legenda del pianista sull'oceano"". Whatever imperfections some nit pickers might find in them, those two films share the same quality of being strikingly beautiful and extremely melodious, giving pleasure both to your eye and your ear. The harmony, which the director creates between the different film elements, disarms you completely, leaves you dazed some time after the last shots are over. Both films also have similar story structure: the events are unraveled as a string of reminiscences, prompted by some critical point, which usually forms the climax (usually, smth' or smb's demise) and brings about the end of a certain important period in the character's life (the one that most influenced the kind of personality the character has become when we first meet him in the film). This structure is by no means boring and, mastered skilfully by Tornatore, serves its purpose of showing the character's development very well.The paradisaical subterfuge of Tornatore's art is also such that the film manages to move you to the very deep of your heart without resorting to artificial sentimentalism or cheap pathetic. It just garners the quintessence of those little darling moments in real life and on screen that most of us cherish.Much to his credit, Tornatore has proved to us with this and his other films that he is a worthy heir to the Great Masters of the Golden Age in the Italian cinema: Fellini, Visconti, Rosselini. One man is not enough to start the Silver Age but can definitely be a national treasure.",Cinema Paradiso

Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the aesthetic of someone's love of Film, family, hometown and true love.So much beautiness that can not be explained only through a simple writing that contains a review, the sweetest compliment. You have to feel it yourself, an experience about following the story of a movie-loving boy from small, teenage and adult.Centered at the life of Salvatore 'Toto' Di Vita in a small village in Sicily, Italy filled with stories, ambitions, love, life struggles and self-discovery.
meaningful and for some people full of tears.
'Toto' who has no father since his father was avowed lost in the war, befriends with Alfredo the film watcher.. a person whose in charge in the screening of a movie in theaters.
Toto's ambition and love of film is what attaching this like-father-child relationship.
various events full of joys and sorrows, life lessons 'the Dad's' taught, and advices whenever 'Toto' is having a trouble makes this movie just like a family drama about Toto and Alfredo's closeness.
but not only the story about the 'Father-child' relationships, this masterpiece also includes Toto's love story to the woman who would later become his ""one and only"", in it. she is Elena Mendola, the 'lucky' woman.convincing act (especially from the boy who played little Toto), elegant storyline, the near perfect directing and the unrelentingly scoring accompanied my journey for 2 hours 35 minutes long without sensing any loss of a moments.This Academy Award's winner for Best Foreign Film 1990 is a special menu that should be tried at least once by a movie fans, especially by a romance drama fans.This is a beautiful film about the love of movies and life.",Cinema Paradiso
270,dimitriscisse,Cinema paradise : what a wonderful movie,9,2 March 2016,"Cinema paradise was one of the best movies I have ever seen because in Toto I saw my self and secondly was a very touching movie that made me look back and think different things about my life.Tornatore combined humorous elements with the nostalgia for the past. The one thing that I want to complain is the character of Elena was poor acted. She is a daughter of a rich father who removed in the small town of Toto because of her father's job. I wanted to see her not only refusing Toto's love but she should act like she is ''detesting'' him . We mustn't forget that is a postwar period and then riches and poors were 2 different worlds which it was unacceptable to mix them . Elena's father didn't show the anger because her daughter fell in love with Toto.Also Tornatore didn't show how the relation between Toto and his sister and mother grows. Did Toto feel some anger for the cruel behavior of his mother? I saw only his sister at the beginning of the movie saying that he won't come again to see them even if Alfredo has died. Also I believe that Alfredo reminds the director a person who had a close contact with him and he might affect his whole career by showing the way and the choices that he should do. Alfredo was like that father that Toto wanted to have.After seeing this movie I had to asked my father if the situation was like that in my country Greece. He said me yes. Just like Spain people centering to see a movie with a humorous and relaxing mode . After their work they knew that going to cinema will have some rest there by laughing, sleepping and more. Each one of them he is trying to rest as he wants that makes tragicomic states because the children of the small town are making fun of them.Cinema paradise was a movie that responds in the requirements of reality and this makes it much better because Tornatore showing the simple things of life ( love , poorness ) created a masterpiece without displaying something excessive and extreme.",Cinema Paradiso

This is a movie to love, to see over and over and over again.",Cinema Paradiso
272,Boanthrope,Absolutely superb. But what about the director's cut?,10,6 March 2002,"I completely adore this film. It probably has more depth of emotion then any film that I have ever seen. Period (as you Yanks say).I'm not going to whitter on about the general stuff concerning this film. There are enough other reviews already here, most of which I agree with.My comments concern the 160-odd minute ""Director's Cut"".I remember taping and watching the original version on TV. A UK TV magazine picked it as 'film of the week' so I thought I'd tape it and watch it some time. I did tape it and although I was only half-heartedly interested in it before putting it on, by the end of the film I was in tears. A few weeks later I watched it again. The tears still came. This film was awesome.I decided to buy it. But I looked for the DVD and there were two - the regular version and director's cut. I was skeptical about buying the director's cut. At 45-minutes-or-so longer it wasn't just the case of the odd scene added or extended, this was a different film. I went with the director's cut.In a nutshell I was pleased with the new version. I'd say 85.6% of the new footage actually adds positively to the original film. There are a few 'new' scenes that make me think ""Hmmm, why has this been added? It seems a bit pointless."" But generally, the extra footage just adds to the depth of the original.POSSIBLE SPOILERS...Most of the added footage comes in the later part of the film. There are new some scenes when Salvatore is a teenager but most occur when he is an adult returning home. For example, there is a scene with Toto and Alfredo where we learn Toto's interpretation of Alfredo's story about the soldier who waited for 99 days. Most significantly, whilst Toto is at his home village for Alfredo's funeral he notices (sort of) and eventually meets back up with Elena.  This scene is fantastic (barring a one-second camera shot in which the director loses his faith in himself (injustifiably) to put the viewer inside Salvatore's mind).Like I said before, the director's cut adds to depth of the original 2-hour cut, particularly concerning Alfredo's character. This cut reveals Alfredo to be a much more eccentric and enigmatic character, especially where the relationship between him, Salvatore and Elena is concerned.So, the original cut is superb and like many great films has a brilliant and uncannily apt and beautiful soundtrack. The director's cut is for the most part, even better. If you get the chance to see this film, you must see it. It's as simple as that.",Cinema Paradiso
273,nycsean,An excellently nuanced film,10,10 May 2004,"I just saw the new Cinema Paradiso this weekend, which also marks the first time I ever saw it. It's a long film but you don't notice the time passing as you watch, since it speaks on many different levels of terms of life, memory and experience.The film has several storylines, reflecting different comments. A film about a first love, about a mentor and a student, about films or about not being able to go home again. However, to select a single one of these as the main story would miss the overall experience, since they are parts of an overall tapestry about the tough choices life presents.The standard hollywood treatment would made a completely happy ending, our hero gets together with the girl (now woman) of his heart; continues his successful movie career; his mentor remains flawless, and somehow restores the old town's spiritual heart. This doesn't happen, for as his mentor states ""life is much harder than in the movies"".Not to say that this a sad film, it's an extremely happy one, and by being tough and presenting a more truthful aspect of experience, its exquisite moments are that much more joyous.",Cinema Paradiso

It is just told in lines explained by the friendship of an old theater projectionist and a little boy, grown to be a filmmaker himself, from his love for movies when he was just a boy, eager to know more about movies than be just a spectator on the audience.

There are several positive aspects of this movie, but also a few negatives.Cinema Paradiso is very simplistic. It isn't overly complicated, so it is relaxing to watch. It didn't try to be more than it was. The acting by the older man and the young boy Toto (and teenager when he is older) is well done. The ending scene could not have been more perfect to close the film. The main problem I had with this film was the actor who played the adult version of Toto. He looked nothing like the child or teenage version of Toto, so it threw me off a bit. Also, some parts of the film were much too slow or pointless and could have been cut out. The overall running time was a tad too long to keep the movie interesting.Cinema Paradiso is a nice, if somewhat forgettable, film that I think most would enjoy watching.

282,bracketj,Bittersweet Tenderness in Cinema Paradiso,8,5 May 2007,"recognizes the ennobling effect movies can have on viewers, and then proves this maxim by inspiring tenderness in the viewer. Though the story aptly concerns itself with the bitter effects of war on a family, the modernization of small towns, the distortion of culture, and the loss of young love, its lasting impression is the positive effect a loving mentor can have on the life of an individual despite such hardships. Salvatore's adult life does not reflect much outlet for emotional development, so the audience can infer the importance that his childhood, particularly Alfredo, held for him and his maturity. This loving relationship is most poignant for the audience because it occurs between believable individuals. Neither Toto, nor Alfredo, nor their town is reflected as perfect. Rather, they are all shown to have their flaws, their pompousness, humility and crazy characters mixed in with their beauty, compassion and adoration. This film is well balanced and will warm any audience, at any time, with its ageless story of humanity, regret, growth and love.The film style of Cinema Paradiso makes the audience feel the love between Toto and the other characters, particularly Alfredo. Lighting and sound create a storm whose ear-shattering thunder and bright lighting during Salvatore's life review make the audience imagine how deeply he's responding to what he has been told: that Alfredo has died. Also, close-ups of adult Salvatore's face during the same time reveal these deep emotions. The music of Cinema Paradiso is perhaps the most touching element of film style used. Throughout the entire film, variations of the same song are slowed down or sped up during fitting times, and played with varying instruments. This is highly metaphorical, revealing the connection between the bitter and sweet times of life and perhaps, the continuing influence of Alfredo's love throughout Salvatore's highs and lows.",Cinema Paradiso

There is very strong acting by Philippe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio; you might almost believe they were father and son in real life.

I agree completely with those who believe this to be the most romantic love story ever filmed, ever. Let me add one observation. The structure of the Director's cut allows you to complete matters in a way which would have derogated a bit from the absolute excellence of the theme had it actually been pursued.

The story, which is packed with raw emotion, and a beautiful bond between two characters make this film a real joy to watch and will keep you moved throughout the whole 155 minutes in which it runs for.This film follows young Salvatore (Toto), who lives in a small Italian village during the Second World War. Fatherless, he begins to form a bond with the projectionist at the local cinema, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret), a friendship in which the film revolves around.The acting in this is quite good; Philippe Noiret gives a great performance as Alfredo as do all three actors who play Salvatore. But it is not these performances that stand out, but the direction of writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore. Only 32 years of age at the date of its release, Tornatore is able to add beautiful and heartfelt emotion in every single friendship in this film, whether it be between friends, family or lovers. Alfredo and Salvatore's bond is given so much depth and sentiment, that when the smallest things happened to one of them, your heart started racing. The screenplay is able to stay true to the way this film is directed, as it equally as charming as the product which adapted it. Without Tornatore's talent and incentive, this film wouldn't have even been merely what it is.A beautifully sentimental film that brings out the best in friendship, all spearheaded by the masterclass of a ridiculously talented Giuseppe Tornatore, ""Cinema Paradiso"" has got to be the greatest tale of friendship ever shown on the big screen.Rating: 9.6/10Grade: A+",Cinema Paradiso

295,lewisgilber,International Cinema at it's finest!,10,9 August 2019,"Some of the best films out there are those that don't require the use of words to deliver it's narrative or make an audience feel something. And that is exactly what was accomplished in the 1988 Italian classic, Cinema Paradiso.Now, those who have seen it already know that the characters do speak, but as there is only the original Italian dialogue and translations via subtitles, it can be an interesting experience to let the film talk to international audience members just through it's visual storytelling. If you can, try watching the film without any subtitles on, and see what reaction it provokes. I found Cinema Paradiso easy to pick up on without the need to constantly read the English subtitles. This demonstrates a worldwide appeal that with or without the translated subtitles, this film can still be perfectly understandable and can still make it's audience feel something.The outline of this film is very similar to what Damien Chazelle would go on to create with 2016's La La Land, in regards to a heart-warming tribute to the art of film-making, and the countless memories and emotions it can prevoke. Those who weren't keen on the highly saturated view of Hollywood seen in Chazelle's modern tribute will more than likely find writer and director, Giuseppe Tornatore's more subtle and simplistic tribute to international cinema, focusing more on how films can connect communities across the world, and bring people together in a way that other aspects of life such as music, art and books couldn't achieve. Thanks to discovering his love for film and his local cinema, Toto (Salvatore Cacio) finds a lifelong friend in Alfredo, (Philippe Noiret) finds his first love, and gains the drive to head out into the big world, not looking back as he lets his passion drive his life forward.Tornatore isn't only revisiting the nostalgic past on communal gatherings at cinemas, the setting of this community theatre is merely a backdrop to the many story threads that all link to this central location. Coming of age and self discovery are primary factors in young Toto's development from being a typical naughty child character, to a passionate and hard working young man. It's also not afraid to blend it's heart warming and comical approach to cinematic nostalgia, with moments of hard hitting reminders of reality. The fire that takes place half way through the film is not only heart pounding as Alfredo lies unconscious, but also a heart breaking moment, as we see the source of our lead characters happiness get ripped away during a moment of communal gathering and joyous appreciation for an art form our characters love so dear.It can also be very reflective of how the attitudes to cinemas have changed. While still very popular, cinemas are not the communal experience we see happening in this film. It's evolved to where we treat cinema trips more like a trip to a theatre show, rather than a social gathering, often being soaked into the worlds being shown to us by film-makers of today. And the ending scenes of Toto as an adult returning home to watch the remains of this cinema get raised to the ground is horrifying to essentially see the tether to Toto's childhood get brutally ripped away, without tarnishing the memories that we've seen Toto relive.Blasco Giurato's beautiful cinematography takes us truly into Toto's view of life, film and the cinema that has such a profound impact on him as a character. Night shots are dripping with atmosphere and emotion, and the stark contrast between the original church ran cinema that Toto first discovers, with the rebuilt one which looks and feels more like it's part of a cinema chain, while still creating the communal environment, albeit on a more raunchy scale.If you're someone who isn't sure about international releases that don't have English dubs, please consider Cinema Paradiso as a superb place to start. Regardless of whether you follow the story through subtitles or through visual storytelling, this international masterpiece demonstrates how beautiful independent and international cinema can be, when not restrained by Hollywood's westernised money making machine. While Hollywood can still pump out some very glossy productions, sometimes you just need a simple and heart warming tale about growing up and communal nostalgia.SCORES

297,shaifalihere,A beautiful movie about childhood nostalgia and a mentor who'd do anything to protect you.,8,26 September 2014,"The Italian movie Cinema Paradise (1988) written and directed by Guiseppe Tornatore is about childhood reminiscence and a man's efforts of trying to come to terms with the passing time, passing people, and good, lively days when he fell in love with the movies. It has nice countryside Giancaldo shown with people going on about their daily chores, living a slow, peaceful life; the dark, rainy nights on the roads of a small town reminded me of 'Midnight in Paris', and sometimes even 'Sawariya'. Alfredo, the village theatre's projectionist, beautifully played by Phillipe Noiret and Toto(child version), played by Salvatore Cascio has a mentor-student kinda relationship. After the news of Alfredo's passing away, the movie is in flashback, and you get a feeling that sometimes there is nothing but nostalgia- nostalgia and remembrance of the past, of people in your past, of the place of your birth where you haven't been to since years, of the simpler and purer times, of the presence of a soul (mentor) that would always protect you. It's a beautiful movie, with which you could relate to if you ever felt the urge to go back in time and revisit the lively, easier world of childhood. The movie has a human touch, for sure. It also seamlessly includes the history of World War2 and the many deaths that it took. The background music needs special mention, which made the movie right on spot with generating tension, suspense, or a tug on your heart strings.",Cinema Paradiso
298,m-narmin,Did I just watch the greatest AND the smartest movie of all time?,10,18 October 2018,"I've never been a huge fan of Italian movie industry (Spaghetti western simply killed my mind), especially I have to biased approach towards the Italian-French crossover movies, having the belief that all they are about are the strong mature romantic scenes (well, the last scene made kind of reaffirm this belief:) ).But! This movie is everything for million reasons: great humor, realisticly kind, touchy yet not in a cliche melodrama way, super dynamic AND gives you RIGHT lessons about true friendship. In contrary to ""Good Will Hunting"", where an older friend of a father-less boy gives him a ""follow your dreams and forget about your talent"" kind of mainstream advice (IMHO. sorry, if it's your favorite movie tho), in Nuovo Cinema Paradiso the old friend truly cares about the boy, shows him the true face of love and life before he is left heartbroken, directs him for a better life and higher standards. Alfredo shows Toto that nostalgia is the feeling that keeps us where we are and at the end of the day we realize that we belong to nowhere. Moreover, aren't most of his word simply quote worthy (and I am not even talking about real old Hollywood quotes he used)?Well, I was left with two questions at the end: I did not completely get the very last scene of the movie, but it must be a tribute to the old Hollywood. And was Toto actually happy with the life he get? His mother said a wise thing at the end: we pay for our goals and dreams by loneliness. Is it always true or is it possible to balance? Was it possible for Toto to find the true love after all this time, or did he stick to Elena's memories just to have that nostalgic little shelf in his heart against the whole beautiful, dirty and rich life he ended up in? That's some good food for thought, and all the great directors leave us with similar questions, so that we will not forget the movie in the nearest future.Will definitely watch it with my kids one day!",Cinema Paradiso

306,haftad,"Without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made",10,4 February 2016,"Cinema Paradiso, is by far one of my favorite movies of all time, along with Schindler's List. Both movies give me teary eyes for different reasons. Schindler's List is a sad movie, while Cinema Paradiso is not really a sad movie, and yet it is impossible to watch it without feeling emotional or nostalgic. There is no good verses evil in this movie. In a way, it is all good.As many others mention in their reviews, Cinema Paradiso is a celebration of movies. But it is much more than just that. It is about love, friendship, mischievous acts, life, and above all, nostalgia. Regardless of what your life background is, you feel very connected with the story and relate to it. We all had things we loved when we were kids, and loved someone as we became an adult. So, we were all like Toto in a way as we were growing up. The story may even be more relatable if we immigrated from our childhood city to live somewhere else.More details, with some spoilers:1- There are 3 phases of Toto's life in the movie, played with 3 different actors. The kid Toto is full of life and excitement. It is a joy to watch him. The young Toto is also excited, but about other things in life, mainly about a girl, while he shows some frustrations and negative emotions too (like when he is on the phone and screaming and yelling). The older Toto is somewhat emotionless. He is an important man in his field of work now, and yet his life feels empty with no joy. This is something that happens to many of us as we grow older, we achieve more in life, and get excited less and less.2- The moment that the old movie theater is imploded, is an amazing and yet sad scene. You see in the faces of the old people watching the implosion, a sense of loss. The movie theater symbolized all their past, their youth, their memories; and at that moment it was all gone.3- The friendship between Toto and Alfredo develops in the most natural and beautiful way. It is like a Father/Son relationship, but also a Mentor/Protégé, and definitely as just two friends. Both of them are quite likable.4- Ahh, the last scene. The kissings. It even makes the emotionless Toto have teary eyes while smiling. One of the best endings in the movie history, and what makes it even better is Ennio Morricone's amazing soundtrack.",Cinema Paradiso

It is one of the best foreign movies ever and righteously won the Oscar for best foreign film.The film begins with Salvatore's mother trying to call him to tell him about the death of an old friend. When Salvatore, now a professional film maker, here's the news, he remembers his childhood in the recently panic-stricken town (from world war 2) that he grew up in, his love for cinema and the life long friendship with the cinema's projectionist, Alfredo, and his teenage love, Elena.This film struck me in a personal way, as I am a movie buff. Never before has cinema felt closer to me before watching this. The last 5 minutes will be most enjoyable to those who, like me, know a lot about cinema as this features clips from some of the greatest motion pictures from the early golden age (don't forget to look out for the mini scene with Charlie Chaplin in one of his early short films).The cast was well picked and has a great director who actually knows how to move people in a deep way, unlike a lot of modern day directors.I have also heard there is an extended edition, which I have not seen and I have heard it does not have the same emotional impact as the original.

The old additional scenes of the film in the cut of the director do not add some value. The little added scenes of the character in first part of the film, comprised the loss of the virginity in the theatre, serv of the Toto in order to reduce the film. It was enough for knowing that it has been developed in on in the theatre, we has not had particular need of the additional one. The passing and the loss of the Elena were a life part. Our first love is always powerful and the relative loss us standard many things, including like still loving. To carry it newly within the history is to change the film. The participation of the Alfredo to its preoccupantesi passing moreover changes to its character from one figure of the father to a old man of meddling.

311,Goatlips,"Only Watch The Director's Cut! ('New Version', 173 min)",10,1 April 2021,"Like it or not, the edited version misses out the end of the story and, thus, the entire point of the film! The hacked version may be more palatable or enjoyable, but that's not the point - the 'New Version' is the true story. The full length, 173 minute, 'Director's Cut' reveals an 'English Patient'-like morbid tale, whereas the edited film must be like a version of The English Patient where Fiennes & Scott-Thomas never have the affair!It's a dark film, but I fail to see where the R rating comes from, the only nudity is shown on the censored clippings film (which, admittedly, is unnecessary).The point of the film is that the projectionist deliberately sabotaged the youngster's affair so that it'd be romanticised in his mind forever and never spoilt - like the perfect love depicted in the movies. I don't think you'd appreciate this from the watered-down cut.The 173 min Director's Cut is the definitive version (and actually the originally shown version) and the greatest foreign language film ever made - it was finally released on Blu-ray with the 25th anniversary edition.",Cinema Paradiso

I expected little from it, but with every minute that goes by, the film draws you deeper and deeper through its charm alone.  It's sweet and sentimental, romantic and a tad cynical (""Life is not like the movies - It is much harder and difficult"")  First love leads to lost love, memories serve as sad reminders of happier times, the ones you love are fading away.  These themes are all played out in a charming montage of sublime scenes, each lovely word of dialogue revealing the pain and loneliness we all feel, the very loneliness which continually draws us to the movies to begin with.

318,samuelanthonytaunton,"""Life is not what you see in films"", 'Cinema Paradiso' - Review/Analysis",9,28 July 2021,"'Cinema Paradiso' is a cinematic delight. It's very true that if you love cinema, you will simply adore this. This is a film in which Giuseppe Tornatore was able to express his particular love for cinema. This love not only corresponds with spectators who share a passion for films nowadays but for the Italians in 'Cinema Paradiso' and millions of others globally during WWII. Yes, cinema is entertainment, but during wartime it was a means of necessary escapism - seeking the thrills and spills of the big screen and for a moment of time just forgetting the horrors of distant warfare.One of the first shots of the film is of a middle-aged man. This man is Salvatore (played by Jacques Perrin) who's wife has just informed him of the death of someone named Alfredo. After this name is mentioned, the camera slowly dollies towards a disheartened Salvatore. Clearly Alfredo was a man of great importance. Through this opening scene, Tornatore immediately sets up the importance of memory and nostalgia as we are essentially thrusted into the memories of an older Salvatore to learn of his past, from a young boy into a man. Events play out through this flashback. The story follows a young Salvatore or rather 'Toto' who works for a village priest, often distracted by the enthrals of the local cinema and along with it, Alfredo the projectionist. Toto is a cheeky young boy who from the beginning can be seen giggling at the enforcement of film censorship by the priest who rings his bell during any scenes of embrace or sexual hints. This is much like the Hays Code which was put in place from the early 30s to the 60s, placing regulations on things such as profanity or sexual scenes in Hollywood films. We aren't initially told when the film is set but with the use of mise-en-scene (props) such as film posters of Casablanca, we can gage and idea for the film's time period. This was something that really drew me in, how the film is essentially a drama but with an historical outlook as well.Over time we learn of Toto's infatuation with the projection room and Alfredo. Without a father, Toto seeks paternal care from Alfredo and dreams of following in his footsteps. But one shot sums up the job of a projectionist where Alfredo is framed inside the projection room, cut off from everyone else, a lonely life to lead. ""You work like a slave, always alone."" Over the course of the film's first act, the relationship between Toto and Alfredo blossoms into something special, especially as Toto is taken under the wing of Alfredo in learning to become a projectionist. This relationship is kindled even further following a fire at the cinema which causes Alfredo to become blind, bringing Toto even closer to him, acting as his carer at times.Over the course of the film, we see a huge variety of films being shown at the local cinema. This really intrigued me, seeing Hollywood blockbusters from a foreign perspective such as John Ford's western - Stagecoach. Tornatore also explores the expansive enjoyment of silent cinema, how the slapstick comedies of Charlie Chaplin made people laugh all around the world. Silent films were accessible to all, perhaps this is why Hitchcock described silent films as ""the purest form of cinema"".During the early 40s there was a huge boom in popularity for cinemas. After the construction of the new 'Cinema Paradiso' (following the demise of the previous one), audiences are even more delighted. The males in particular are extremely excited by the prospect of kissing scenes. As Toto grows up, now in his teen years, of course the world of cinema also starts to mature with films now shown in colour. Toto's life soon starts to change when he falls for Elena, the new girl of the village. But Toto is soon advised by Alfredo that ""life is not what you see in films"" and forces him to go and make a name for himself. These events in flashback form are occasionally intercut with close ups of the older Salvatore who looks back on his life's memories, the decisions he's made. Were they right or wrong?'Cinema Paradiso' is ultimately made up of 3 acts: Toto's life as a boy, Toto during his adolescent years and a much older Toto who returns to his home town for the funeral of his father figure Alfredo. It's this final act which I felt really connected with. Salvatore returns to his home town of Giancaldo to find that much has changed. We often look back on things with rose coloured spectacles but in reality, Toto finds that much has changed - its buildings, the people, all of it. The cinema where Toto spent much of his youth is eventually destroyed to make way for a car park. In fact the whole town has been overtaken by the clasp of commercialism with billboards surrounding the square. This ending strongly implies how nostalgia can be a scary thing, the difference between appearance and reality. People can remain (such as the familiar faces of Giancaldo) but as we age, so do the things around us. Tornatore definitely highlights how important cinemas are, sacred palaces of dark and light. Despite the evolution of DVDs and streaming platforms like Netflix nowadays, we should always look to cinemas as a place of viewing films properly.Overall, 'Cinema Paradiso' is a beautifully constructed film with a beautiful message at its heart. One thing that I've completely forgotten to mention is the brilliant soundtrack by the masterful Ennio Morricone which certainly adds to the emotional heights of the film. Scenes between Alfredo and the young Toto are heart-warming to watch and the acting is consistently strong throughout. I also thought that the combined messages of nostalgia, growing up and a passion for film were something that I particularly related with. A loving film which makes you love the world of cinema even more!",Cinema Paradiso

That was satisfying for me. I loved this when I first saw it and I enjoyed it even more in the director's cut -- I cried more at the end. Also the mature Salvatore (Jacques Perine?) had a lot more scenes in the longer version. I liked seeing him talking to his mother and trying to reconcile his childhood memories with the man he'd become. Just an overall beautiful love story of films and unrequited youthful love!

323,potblackettle,Changed my life,10,23 May 2003,"When I was around eight my dad said, honey I want you to see this movie. My father has always been a diehard film fan and made one out of me.  We watched Cinema paradiso and at the end I told my father that I wanted to work in films.  More than a decade later I am a senior in film studies. The beauty of Cinema Paradiso is that it rings true on so many levels.  It manages to be sweet and touching without being saccharine, it is sincere. The story of a young boy growing up with facism and without a father.   He finds a father figure in a cranky projectionist.  In it's essence this is a film about the power of films.  It also touches on the fact that in life we have to give some things up to achieve others.  Cinema Paradiso hasone of the greatest endings in any film, a beautiful montage of light and film imagery.  To this day it grabs something in my soul and lifts it.  This is a film for parents to watch with children, friends to show each other and lovers to bond over.  One of the great bittersweet coming of age stories. This film was my father's greatest gift to me.  If you enjoy Cinema Paradiso check out Medditerranio and Bread and Tulips.",Cinema Paradiso

Cinema Paradiso is about a boy in love with the cinema and a girl and how his adult friend, the film operator in the local theater, wanted the best for the boy. The movie has a theatrical version and a director's cut. I would suggest watching the theatrical cut, which is actually my favorite, before watching the director's cut. The director's cut answers a lot of unanswered questions in the theatrical cut, but in my opinion it went a little bit too far in explaining certain things. Telling the story in flashbacks of his early youth and later teenage years was a fine way of developing the characters. My favorite part of this movie is the ending, which still and probably will always remain my favorite.",Cinema Paradiso

326,sicboi81,What Makes European Cineam Great,8,15 April 2005,"Cinema Paradiso is at the crux of everything that I believe makes European cinema superior to American. Cinema Paradiso is the reminiscence of a middle-aged Italian filmmaker, Salvatore who, upon learning of the death of his mentor, a projectionist named Alfredo, remembers his childhood in postwar Sicily and the movie house, the Paradiso, and the ways in which classic cinema is intrinsically tied to his memories and his life. When Salvatore returns to his village for Alfredo's funeral, he sees the old, abandoned Paradiso and watches it be demolished. He then returns to his life in Rome and watches a reel Alfredo left him of all of the classic movie kisses he had edited out of films over the years at the village priest's bequest. The major element that this great film has that is invariably absent from American dramas is subtlety. If Cinema Paradiso had been an American film, Salvatore wouldn't have reminisced much about his childhood; it would have been glossed over in a seven minute short leaving us with no character development. When he returned to his village for Alfredo's funeral, he most likely would not have been the thoughtful, taciturn man that we see, but some sort of vigilante ready to hatch some last minute, hair-brained, against-all-odds scheme to save the old Paradiso. He would have dealt with some stuffy bureaucrats looking to demolish the Paradiso for unclear personal reasons and he would have had to rally the town to save the theatre of his childhood. Also, in an American version, his childhood sweetheart, Elena, would have somehow returned after thirty years and he would have somehow overcome her distrust to win her back in the end. An American director would have inevitably found a way to destroy any pathos in the plot and turn it into a good-time film. However, Giuseppe Tornatore played his cards right. In the version that is known and loved, Salvatore reminisces with some sadness about his lost youth, returns to his village, attends Alfredo's funeral, says nothing as the Paradiso is demolished, and goes back to Rome. Nothing explodes, he doesn't get the girl, there are no heroes, but Salvatore comes to a subtle personal epiphany about his own life. And that is enough. Perhaps this is the way that European cinema depicts life more closely to the way it is and not in the way it should be as in the American cinema. American cinema never lets its viewers get too emotionally close to its protagonists because they are always in situations in which we never realistically find ourselves and are, therefore, always distanced from their actions. We, as humans, gage our lives by our memories and, in that spirit, Tornatore's tale of a man for who film was the defining factor in his life, brilliantly evoke these tender sentiments for us. A great watch.PS Get the director's cut if possible, the sub-titled, American version has long portions cut out that greatly add to the continuity of the plot and explain things more clearly.",Cinema Paradiso

Now being an Indian I am used to watching films that are well over 220 minutes length, But the only complain i have from this awesome movie is the pacing.There were some really wonderful moments in the film. Virtually every scene between Alfredo and Toto was nice,especially the one where ALfredo saves him from his mother, and the one where he comes to give an exam.and the Final scenes where the Cinema Paradiso is dynamited to the ground and the subsequent film that Toto sees which Alfredo had left for him. There is no denying about the level of the subtleties of the emotions conjured and the delicacy of the treatment.Performance by all the Actors is very believable, especially Alfredo and Little Toto.There was a similar movie that was made in India which had the same feel. It was Swades. I mean the movie had an altogether different premise but some of the emotions it evoked were familiar to the one Cinema Pradiso Did.I would give it 8/10",Cinema Paradiso

Rare is a masterpiece, where you cannot needle that acute and beautiful pain the movie is causing to you, but yet, you succumb and cry.The music, especially, though based on a common theme, is heart rendering.

With a taste for Early 50's Italy, small town life is seen honestly through a young boy named Toto. His father, off to war for so long, is unknown to him. His mother is stressfully attempting to raise him.Escape is found through the movies and the mentorship of the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo.Life becomes a relentless pursuit of film, both in technical production, and love of the art.Characters ranging from the local mentally challenged Denizen who warns all that this is `my square', to the priest who plays so central a role to daily life, he is the town censor. Pepper the landscape with other characters who reward us with laughter and depth of feeling and you have an idea of this film.Alfredo is the heart of the movie.  The scruffy projectionist, without child, who becomes both teacher, and guidance councilor to the young waif Toto.  The movie moves thru various stages of Toto and Alfredo's life, greeting both tragedy and comedy with equal aplomb.This is a sure winner for those willing to enjoy an Italian film made with grace and sincerity.Sit back and enjoy a sure winner!!",Cinema Paradiso

""The soldier stop waiting and go away at the very 99th day,when a day after he would probably have the princess' heart."" Maybe sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away,leaving the memory lasting forever.The last fifty minutes of the movie,particularly I think, is the best part.The climax comes when the man and the woman meet each other again thirty years after their inevitable miss.I cant help burst into tears cause I can't hold it anymore after 2 hours' living together with the excellent characters.It's not until this day,by this movie that I am successfully convinced A man can really hold his love for as much as 30 years!Life is like a movie,but it's harder.",Cinema Paradiso

337,kstro,Great stuff!,10,22 October 2003,"This ranks as one of my all time favourites. A celebration of the cinema and of life, Cinema Paradiso is beautifully crafted and one of those rare few that manages to touch on so many global themes (while lesser films struggle to find any theme). A coming of age film about (among other things) friendship, family, love, loss, war, religion, and politics, set against the rugged beauty of the Sicilian countryside, Paradiso transports the viewer effortlessly to that place, as if we had lived there all our lives. Like Hallstrom's ""My Life As A Dog"" and Robert's ""My Fathers Glory"", Tornatore has surrounded his protagonist with quirky characters in perfect balance; i.e. the kinds of people-you-know, and people-you'd-like-to-know. This alone makes it the type of universally transferable movie everyone can enjoy. But for me, the masterstroke was Toto's love of movies. This added another more subtle level to an already well rounded flick.  Of course the Paradiso was a metaphor for change/progress, a symbol of community spirit, etc.  However, to try and analyze this film too much would be doing it a supreme injustice.  It is simply a beautiful piece of cinematic history, a film for all true movie-lovers.",Cinema Paradiso

But further the movie shows interesting insights into the ""culture of ""movie-watching"":All the people of the village who watch the movies in their ""cinema paradiso"" are really moved by the films and express their feelings overtly and loud - not like today, where there has to be a very intellectual silence in the theater audience. The cinema is really part of their lives and it has a direct meaning to them - every film is a new event. Think of the priest, who calls the kissing scenes ""pornography""! At first this hysterical man seems very ridiculous, but if you think of the existential meaning the moving images give to their audience, then it seems like he wants to try to defend ""his"" church from being occupied by a new technical god. But the film shows also, that movies have got no objective meaning unless they've got a special and unique meaning FOR YOU.""Cinema Paradiso"" is simply brilliant, the characters are very well portrayed and the setting is perfect.

It is a far better and more complete cut than the original release - which restores Jacques Perrin's towering but understated performance from a small walk on part to the major role it always was. It also reinstates a crucially key scene which was deleted from the original and is fundamental to the completion of this much darker version. I cried in this version even more .... The effortless control of crowd scenes both inside and out make it hard to believe a crew is ever present. The young and old Toto are particularly impressive along with the ever reliable Philippe Noiret, and Morricone's score is quite wonderful.

345,tom-1203,Tedious beyond belief,2,20 May 2005,"I really don't understand how this film got to be so famous and widely recommended. Two hours of clumsy sentimentality, in which nothing happens; a coming-of-age tale which tackles none of the problems of adolescence; characters who spend most of their time simpering over each other, yet they never bother trying to make them connect with the viewer; child acting so dreadful a wooden puppet with its strings cut would have been a better replacement...I resent the laziness of the film, they thought they could rely on its magic formula of nostalgia, saccharine and being foreign so they thought ""we don't need to bother building up any genuine feeling for these characters"". The story starts with an incorrigible young tyke (who i found extremely irritating) befriending the local projectionist. That's about all you need to know, what there is of a plot that develops from there doesn't really matter - it doesn't offer any interest, it doesn't put any of the characters in a dilemma, it all just dissolves into the steady flow of sap. With a plot development occurring every twenty minutes or so, thank God that we're anchored to the motif of the cinema by lengthy footage of people sitting around in it, making entertaining comments which make us just resonate with the warmth of the Italian people. More sugar anyone? Perhaps if I had a very fragile and elderly relative - I mean several centuries old - for whom trying to follow a plot that wasn't totally linear might get their blood up, who was too mentally impaired to take a character at anything but face value, for whom nuanced was just a seven letter word they weren't sure how to spell, then I might recommend to them Cinema Paradiso. Although the possibility that their heart might stop mid-way through, making me culpable for their death, would make me think twice. In fact I think I've got it, Cinema Paradiso might be a very good film to die to. Especially if you've been incapacitated waiting to die for a very long time, and would like to assure yourself that other people have been subjected to something of what you're going through.The Spirit of the Beehive (La Espíritu de la Colmena) is sometimes presented as Cinema Paradiso gone right, again centred on a cinema in a small town and a child's reaction to it. Sure it's slow, and makes no concessions to commercialism, but it is beautifully directed and in an understated way develops the viewer's empathy for the characters. Exactly the opposite of the crass tedium of the film I've just had the misfortune to see.",Cinema Paradiso
346,quintenschram,One of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen,10,29 June 2020,"When someone says a movie is a classic, or that it is one of the best movies
ever made I usually find myself just liking the movie a lot but nothing more. For Cinema Paradiso this was not the case. Never have i seen a movie with so much heart. Its absolutely beautiful. Like you probably already read, this is a story about friendship, love, a small town and its local cinema which seems to be the emotional center of the town.What I love most about this film is how this film captures the mess of a simple town and its people. A friendship between a projectionist and a boy and the love between a young man and a girl. Things you might not consider very interesting or new at first. And during the movie you might not really understand what the movie is trying to say with this mess of a town. Until the end, where you realise, just like life itself: It was the most beautiful mess. And that is where this film really gets you. All by surprise. I think i have never cried as much during a movie as I did when i watched Cinema Paradiso. Maybe Schindlers list (which is also very good) but the reason why I then still would prefer a film like Cinema Paradiso is because its just a less depressing film overall.So will you like this film?
If you love movies with heart, with characters to care about. Or when you are a person to cry easily during films, I think you will love it!If you are very cynical it might not be the best pick for you.
Some people who don't really get the film think that people only like this film because of the nostalgic ode to cinema. And that is simply not true. I think they missed the entire point what made this movie so incredibly good.",Cinema Paradiso

A movie about cinema, friendship and love, about surviving and thriving, about living with what we have and still be happy with it. A flashback to a happy and eventful childhood that makes Salvatore Di Vita, incredibly played by Salvatore Cascio as a young boy, a successful Italian filmmaker, go back to his hometown, after years of isolation in Rome. A childhood where he learned the art of cinema together with Alfredo, a beautiful portrait by Philippe Noiret (don't forget to watch Il Postino).
A recollection of memories that show us that life is worth to be lived as long as we stay close to the ones we love, that we care and allow ourselves to be part of something that is bigger than our egos.

'Cinema Paradiso' is simply the finest movie I have ever seen. Like many who have posted at this site before me I have seen it many many times. It reaches within me to places other movies have never reached and I have often wondered why. Perhaps it is because of it's simplicity. It contains no expensive special effects, it has no gratuitous sex or violence, it has no ""multi-millon dollar per performance"" actors that I know of, it is arguable whether it even has a story line, and yet it soars far above the nonsense that film makers are producing these days. It's characters are portrayed by each and every actor in award winning style and the music is not only beautiful but absolutely perfect for this film.It is quite simply the story of a human life and it's tragedies and triumphs within the context of a vocation. A young boy matures and gradually learns the lessons of life, cultivates his passion for the cinema, and is rewarded with professional success; however, he remains unfulfilled for true love has escaped him only to return in the form of a gift of love which transcends time, space, and death to reveal at the closing of the film Toto's one true mistress.A staggering triumph of both the cinematic art and of story telling and yet there may be found people who do not like this movie ....

The projectionist ends the story by asking the question, ""Why does the soldier finally give up when he is so close to his goal?""

It is a beautiful example of foreign film making and contains many ideas and themes that many U.S. directors should utilize more often. I love this movie because of the ideas to do with innocence, happiness, love and loss and how they affect ourselves and how hollow people can become if exposed to either too much or not enough of any of these things. a highly commended mention for the score, brilliantly executed and fitting the mood perfectly, the music is the proverbial icing on the cake that gives this movie even more of a soulful atmosphere than it would have had with out it. The story flows seamlessly, and the main characters are genuinely likable, and one almost feels a sense of loss when the movie is over every. every character, no matter how small a part they play in the film, all have their own sense of belonging, embellishing the story line from start to finish. It is the characters, even the smallest one that keep the story moving, from the village idiot to Salvatore himself, and, despite the fact that I don't normally like movies that are generally longer than 1.5 hours, 2 at a pinch, I was able to watch this movie and keep track of the story, and still be able to empathize with the characters. a truly touching moment is when Salvatore discovers what Alfredo's final gift to him is, especially with how the music tied everything together produced a brilliant movie moment.",Cinema Paradiso

359,DonBrasco,My Personal Best Film Ever!,10,9 February 2002,"This movie simply has something more than the rest of all the movies. It touches your heart, but not in the way that other movies try to do.  This movie seems to manage brilliantly with no effort at all and the answer to how it manages lies in the fact that it is AUTHENTIC. I only know of another movie that manages this (my Personal #2) - 'Central Station'.  The only difference is that one is so authentic in 1950's Italy and the other in Brazil.For this movie and 'The Legend of 1900' alone, in my opinion, Tornatore earns himself a place in the list of the top 10 directors of all time. I Fully Recomend this movie to all those who know how to appreciate a genuinely good movie.",Cinema Paradiso

It just touched my soul when I watched it because it had such great symbolism which is hard to see at times but, when you see it, you feel as if your in a different world. Now your probably wondering why i was crying and laughing and crying again and it was because the movie was bad then good and then bad again, no no no...don't get me wrong this movie was absolutely a masterpiece through-and-through. The reason why i was crying and laughing and so on was because the movie made me feel so many different emotions at one time and it changed so quickly but, the way they changed it was flawless. I may be saying this in a really complicated way but i think that anyone at any age should be able to watch this. I know it says rated R on the front but all the partial nudity and innuendos are adult stuff and younger children would not understand...and no there is no sex. In conclusion, I've been writing in a mashed up manner and that is only because i can not explain how much of a moving, touching, and just flat out unbelievable movie this was...PLEASE WATCH IT...",Cinema Paradiso

This movie is different, and....beautiful. It's the kind of movie that reassures you that the magical movies are still being made, the ones that you can keep watching over and over again.

362,bo-selecta,Italians do it better.,10,15 December 2002,"Sure there are a plethora of ""coming of age"" flicks out there, but nothing like this. In fact I find it difficult to categorise Cinema Paradiso, as it has so many ingredients which blend almost seamlessly into the narrative arc - drama, humour, pathos, suspense, romance, plus depictions of the ever changing religious, familial, political and social environments in the Sicilain town of Giancaldo. At its core, Paradiso's main theme is obviously the love of cinema.  The film celebrates the medium's ability to bring a group of rather disparate people together for a couple of hours to indulge in a pastime that, for some, is a nice escapist diversion.  However, for Salvatore Di Vita (""Toto""), it becomes his passion.*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT ***Seemingly abandoned by Elena (his first love) and prompted to broaden his horizons by his mentor Alfredo, twentysomething Toto leaves Giancaldo and eventually becomes a succesful filmaker. The original (ie shorter version) suggests that Salvatore has abandoned his his hometown merely to further his career. The director's cut adds more subtextual layers to the plot, and confirms that Salvatore has shunned his past because in some ways, it was too painful to face. Therefore we see a more wistful, regretful and perhaps even cynical Salvatore. His reunion with Elena gives him some closure, yet, despite his success with his first love (film), he still longs to find true love and fulfillment.Nobody can convey emotional honesty on film more effectively than the Italians, however, Paradiso's sentimentality is not as obvious and therefore manipulative as the so-called sentiment in most English speaking dramas (Forest Gump, Patch Adams, etc). Rather, the emotion just creeps up on you - the score and the cinematography are continually affecting, absorbing, and evocative.  For lovers of film and hopeless romantics (like myself), the release of emotion Toto exhibits in the final scene will stay with you for days.  No matter how many times I see it, the sheer power of the scene always gives me goosebumps.With excellent characterisations realised by superlative acting, a compelling and moving story, and a finished product which is technically (editing, mis en scene, score, etc) A1, I cannot recommend this film enough.So very few films offer the viewer the opportunity to temporarily inhabit another world, whilst at the same time perhaps, contemplate their own lives - their pasts, their passions, their dreams. The stack of international accolades the film has won (seen at the start of the Directors cut) speak for themselves.  Cinema Paradiso is a rare, timeless gem.
Ratings: ***** for the original version, ****1/2 for the more sombre, reflective directors cut.",Cinema Paradiso

Chance encounters with the fairy dust of this movie - a poster image here, a mention of an actor's name here, the haunting melody - immediately transport me to its world. As I write this I see Toto and I smile. In my mind I sit on a stool and learn from Alfredo as well; I smell his soup warming by the projector and hear the sounds it makes. I hear the squeaks in the floor as Alfredo moves around. I can see the wonder on Toto's face as his friend Alfredo makes his magic. I love many movies but this is my favorite.",Cinema Paradiso

The tears...,10,24 August 2011,"I'll start by saying that I am a film lover and a hopeless romantic, one of those weirdos that would be happy to sit on their couch with popcorn and a movie all day. Now as a film fanatic, I see my share of terrible movies (Knight and Day). I see my share of mediocre movies (Kindergarten cop. I see my share of good movies (Pope of Greenwich Village). Then, sometimes, I see a movie that shakes me to my foundations. Usually, I watch a movie and if I enjoy it I'll say so and maybe mention it to some friends. However, when I see a movie like Cinema Paradiso, the next day I find myself sitting in my room, obsessively thinking about and Googling it. This movie (and of course its soundtrack) have haunted me from the day I first saw it (maybe eight months ago). I won't give anything away, but watch this movie! That said, I would like to make one thing clear: DO NOT RENT THE DIRECTOR'S CUT! The director's cut of this film takes a perfect piece of cinema and turns it into a pointless soap opera style piece of garbage. Rent the original cut, it's my second favourite film of all time (behind Amadeus) and you won't regret it. Now why are you still reading this? Go rent the movie!!",Cinema Paradiso

Hereby,people should learn this culture. Also we should mention the performance of Ugur Yucel who is also one of the best actors of Europe.So instead of watching this silly movie about a young boy and a old fat blind man who thinks he knows everything about life; watch Bandit.We are all Mediterranean people and the movie Bandit depicts the Mediterranean culture better than any movie, including this movie called Cinema Paradiso.Bandit is the Godfather of Europe and Cinema Paradiso is the Vertigo of Italy.

368,DoctorJA,Two great films in one!!!!,10,15 December 2003,"Loved the original (1989) version: the story of a young boy growing up fatherless and precocious. It took Salvatore (Toto) through his life: his childhood, his first love, his success as a film director (which seemed to have happened because Alfredo gave him the gift of loving the cinema), and a special gift from Alfredo after he died, which showed how things had literally come full circle.The New Version is a completely different film. All of the 1989 film is there, but with the real story of Elena and Toto, and Alfredo's meddling in their love and lives. I liked this one just as much, perhaps even more, granted though it may be because of somewhat personal reasons. Anyway, the scene when they finally meet up again is very haunting and well worth the investment if you own the old one. (The New Version actually has both: one on each side of the DVD).I highly recommend this film: it will stand the test of time!!!

There were no scenes that dragged (for me), and the subtitles did not distract me from the wonderful camera work and cinematography which sometimes happens to me with foreign language films. No repeated viewings are needed to understand and enjoy this film. Robert Osbourne of Turner Classic Movies spoke of the new version that is available with over 50 minutes of added footage, but said that he thought that this is one film where added footage did not improve on the original, though he left it to the viewers to decide for themselves by watching them as they are both available on DVD.

371,xarraw,"Slowpaced, relying on atmosphere.",5,10 December 2008,Shortly as always; Acting isn't too good.. sounds that people produce seem artificial. This is a film about a boy growing up in the vicinity of a movie theater. On the background there is a war ongoing but the episodes of the film don't make much connection to it. Story is a bit boring at least from a Finnish point of view.. Only one or two episodes made me smile a bit but the humor isn't too intelligent. Maybe this film is good for some people that can imagine beyond what is shown. For me; characters didn't matter much. Music is more happy than melancholic and I could probably compose something more touching.. :D. Maybe this was a good movie 20 years ago but today you can see much better films with more atmosphere and with a better script.-WarraX-,Cinema Paradiso

It's one of those towns where everybody knows everybody else in the town and seems like an incredible place to grow up. Toto, eventually moves out and makes it as a Big Filmmaker in a big Italian City but realizes the experiences he had growing up as a child where so precious and profound and could never be replicated. I think because of this he could never go back to his hometown. It would be to painful to recall such precious and lost relationships.

375,gerardo_rdzv,An OK love letter to film,6,14 November 2015,"There's really not a lot in this movie that impressed me. The movie is decent and the final act is fantastic. But aside from that you wont find anything that will totally blow you away. Not a single scene, shot or piece of soundtrack will make you think ""Ive never seen that before"". If you enjoy making films then you will find yourself identified with this, but that doesn't make it a masterpiece like everyone says it does. The relationship between Alfredo and the boy never feels natural. He didn't seem to teach him that much or show him a lot of appreciation, yet we are told that they love each other. All the other relationships in the movie are the exact same, never quite completed. The good soundtrack and some very good scenes make up for all the dullness enough to give it a 6. So if you say this is one of your favorites movies Im fine with that, but you shouldn't really call it a great movie. OK and enjoyable at times, but nothing else.",Cinema Paradiso

This film is about choosing a life of love or money gives us a beautiful story about this young boy who grows up to become a successful man in the movie industry. The film starts with the protagonist as a wealthy man living in the big city. He immediately gets a telephone call from his mother saying that Alfredo is dead. With that, he relapses into a state of dream to show us his story, a story of his time with Alfredo, the man who works with the movie projector, and a story of his one true love, Elena. The story also has family elements and we can see the way that the relationship between Toto (the main character) and Alfredo grows from beginning to end. The soundtrack is also a heartwarming collection which really adds to the imagery and tone. The tunes in this movie have stuck with me and are stuck right into my mind, but I don't mind because they are artistic pieces which remind me of this delightful and insightful movie.",Cinema Paradiso

385,coolcat-3,"A magical celebration of cinema, love and growing up",10,8 May 1999,"Cinema Paradiso is a powerful and touching tale of a man losing himself in the tales projected on the big screen in his village theatre. It is through immersing himself in those flickering images that Toto discovers his destiny and then plunges headlong towards it encouraged by the wonderful Alfredo. The movie makes one realize how the cinematic medium can lift you beyond the platitudes of life into a realm of glorious impossibilities. It can make you dream impossible dreams and mayhaps even make you reach towards them, especially if you have a mentor like Alfredo.The movie has a wonderful subplot about Toto discovering love. The desperation of claiming your love, the wrenching agony of thinking you have lost her, and the heights of ecstasy to hold her - they are all portrayed beautifully. But in the end, Alfredo makes Toto realize that he has to flee this small backwater and make his destiny in Rome which is what he does. But his small village calls him back to attend Alfredo's funeral and come face-to-face with his past. As Toto lowers Alfredo's coffin into the grave, as Toto watches the womb he grew up in - the Cinema Paradiso - come down in a heap of rubble, he loses a cherished part of himself that he knows he cannot find in all the success and all the women ""whose voices do not have love in them"". In fine, Cinema Paradiso is an enchanting celebration of the world of cinema.",Cinema Paradiso

Then there are tons of clips from movies so old and so poor as to be irrelevant.

395,jamespiper-34216,Now I Understand,9,7 July 2020,"I watched this several years ago, knowing it was a classic, and forgot it immediately. I later had pangs of envy for people who admired it, wanting to feel that myself, so now gave it another go.Now I understand.Somewhat split in two acts, the lighthearted and comical first half of his younger years, and the deeply moving second half of his teens and successful middle age, beautifully tender all the way through.I think thats what has drawn me most, the film's tenderness. It seems to make humanity so well. That feeling of community of the town, and the part that the cinema plays in that. You feel nostalgia yourself for the towns people at the times they had together there. I love the small details, the boy and girl who share a look across the cinema, later pictured sat together, then later with child, and in the final scene of the funeral procession.
That scene is a really poignant sum of all the lives you've crossed in the last two hours. All gathered together, across the vast space of 30 years, for the life of Alfredo which you cherish yourself, it is superbly acted as it doesn't feel acted at all.The script is poetry. I feel I could watch it now without subtitles, it is so impressing.
Directing too is top class. A stand out moment is when Toto returns home to his mother who halts her knitting, the camera follows a caught thread which unravels (surely symbolic), the camera rotates following the departing taxi and revealing the reunited mother and son (with thread in tail). The direction with toto leaving on the train was also particularly memorable. Interesting that the two moments bookending his life away from the town are so distinct.The revamp of the cinema to lustrous new is an example of the humanity, the juxtaposing of that glamour in a shabby town and the excitement its brings to the people. I really like that the developments are from within, the cinema is upgraded by a local who won the lottery, rather than a new or nameless character.
I always find a love of cinema a fine aesthetic for a film. Like Tarantino's OUATIH, art can be made about art, and why not. Capturing the underside of film is beautiful.This film ties everything together neatly and tenderly, its masterful, and thats why I love it now. I wept like a child when Toto came home, when the camera panned to the framed photo of Alfredo on his wall, it was too much to bear. The final 15 minutes were real emotional viewing.It missed out on a 10 star rating simply because of the love story element. I understand it needed to be small, as it wasnt about that, it was about friendship and the father figure of Alfredo, but I didnt believe it too much.A solid position on my top 10 films, I think.",Cinema Paradiso

The movie is just less than 3 hours(extended version) but there is not a single moment where you find yourself detached from the movie. I wont call the acting at its best but its the story that forms the backbone of the movie. The story brings out relationship between three main pillars of human life - 'Love', 'Friendship' and 'Carrier'. This is the best romantic drama movie I have ever seen.

402,helen20,Movie Magic!,7,21 March 2012,"This is a well crafted, powerful film which evokes a variety of emotions, leaving the viewer with a sort of satisfied exhaustion, like after a good session of yard work. Its focus is the power of love to shape our lives over the long term. The protagonist's passion for the cinema and his youthful immersion in ""first love"" are intertwined, and become mutual symbols each for the other. What constitutes success and what failure? What is or must be sacrificed to achieve our goals, and how are we to know in advance which life goals will prove worthy and enduring? All these dilemmas move beneath the surface of an engaging tale, but without detracting from its drama. Let me point out too an important word of warning that may be missed: When an adult's help and guidance of a young person, no matter how lovingly offered, crosses the line to making decisions for them without their knowledge or consent, the consequence often may be suffering for which no one would have wished.",Cinema Paradiso
403,sage-presage,A sentimental master piece...but the director's cut is just too long,8,2 March 2009,"I have only watched the 3 hour director's cut. In my very own opinion it's not necessary to be that long. This long version explains a lot about love and life, but sometimes it's better to let me have my own imagination. The main idea of the film can be very well explained with the story told by the projectionist. A soldier fell in love with the princess and expressed his love to her, she was impressed and told him that if he could wait 100 days and 100 nights under her balcony, she would marry him. The soldier waited and waited, but at the 99th night, he left. In this version, the boy gives his explanation of the story, ""In one more night, the princess would have been his. But she also could not possibly have kept her promise. And it would have been terrible. He would have died. This way, however, at least for 99 days, he was living under the illusion that she was there, waiting for him."" According to his explanation, the soldier is only a coward that dare not face the truth, thus he does not deserve the love from the princess. Personally I would like to regard this story as the contrast of dream and reality, that the soldier wants to keep the happiness brought by his illusion for ever and won't let the reality break it.The long version also includes the confronts of the former lovers when they meet again after 30 years. They accused each other for not coming to their last unaccomplished meeting, only to discover the truth that they both went. It was the projectionist who persuaded the girl to leave the boy. I think this part is ridiculous. It turns the projectionist from a likable tutor into a selfish old man that made the decision for the boy without his own permission. Besides, I don't like the idea of their one night stand after they discovered the truth. After all, she was a married woman already. The reckless passion only made their love less respectable. The ending is definitely the best part of the whole film. The soundtrack suites the scene so well, really very sentimental. It expresses the love for movies, as well as the happiness of illusion and the touch of memory. Movies, illusion and memory are some sort of distant beauty. The most beautiful things in this world are always those you will never be able to possess, thus you'll never get disappointed for the depressing truth. The movie showed us the truth, but ended with such a sentimental beauty, making it an unforgettable master piece.",Cinema Paradiso

Beautiful Italian scenery and spirit, good positive characters, music of Ennio Morricone, good acting...I never watched the movie which grab you so fast and really connect with the characters, incredible how todays movie lacks of that.
The end is very emotional, last scene is superb, thanks to the music, acting of main actor and beautiful mix of romantic scenes from the other movies like a great tribute to the movies itselfs.There is standard (shorter) and directors cut version. My opinion is that the shorter version is way better, not because added scenes are not interesting, it is more like the added scenes ruin the magic which is maded between main two characters and the last scene then doesn't look natural.",Cinema Paradiso

408,ernestotejedorvideos,simply my favourite movie,10,29 January 2017,"¿Are you romantic? If yes you are at the right spot reading this, If not then maybe this isn't the movie for you..I am indeed very much so, and therefore.. This is simply my favourite movie.By the way there were two versions of the film originally a longer much worse one and a slightly shorter version which is the final one and the one which is now widely available and the one finally kept by the director.The longer version was a bit of a pity I'm afraid, It made the movie loose all its magic and the director Mr Tornatore, was incredibly keen, smart to cut those non-sense scenes and keep only the ones that where useful to preserve all the magic of the movie intact. and here we are talking about a great amount of magic indeed!This film is quite biographical and talks about important things in life (I lived most of them too) Things that happen in real life , the first love, true friendship between two differently aged persons, and great life learnings and true life situations such as an first special magical love you once unsuccessfully tried to pursue in your life but like in Dante's literature (inferno) that so many times slips away , and when you try to recover it it may well be too late, it talks about career decisions and life ambition and it is also one the most beautiful most romantic movie I 've ever seen.Is also an"" Homage "" to the history of movie making and of the world of cinema in general throughout the years, many people won't remember it but the firm was made and produced in the the difficult late 1980's( 1988-89) when cinema was actually truly dying , cinemas were empty ( I actually first saw the movie in Italian in almost empty cinema in 1990) , when the movie came about the true and sad reality was that people didn't't go to the movies anymore and rather just hired a movie tape at home or not even that.. So this masterpiece was like a Hymn like the french revolution's ""la marseilles hymn"" coming to the rescue of all the things that cinema represents to us as humans, the movie therefore appeared just in the right moment and for me it came to engrave in our hearts our love for cinema and tried at that to rescue all the movie movie making and of the magic world of cinema making, that was becoming extinct..To me it came like a first love, a surprise and reminded us all what going to the cinema is all about the experience, the magic feeling you get , the sensations and feelings you share with a crowd of unknown people laughing all together.The film is a poetical representation of love , is about sharing feelings, sharing those special limited, instants of limited time in your life on this planet, and feel with other humans the warmth in your heart , the magic that cannot ever be replaced of the first time your heart actually gets loose and suddenly accelerates and your feelings explode and intensify and you feel love for the first time in your life.. This film is about love the love of people, the love of humankind, it is a film about the first love, the one you will never forget and about the great love and passion some people like me feel about cinema in general. Undoubtedly a Magnificent masterpiece and a fantastic timeless LOVE-film made for our souls by Giusseppe Tornatore, wonderful music and Love Theme written by Ennio Morricone and violin played by Itzhak Perlman my most admired violinist creates like in Queen's famous song A KIND OF MAGIC .. few other films have ever matched..This film is a a must see a classic unrepeatable, once in a lifetime cinematographic jewel masterpiece, the kind I love to watch with my wife in a romantic winter evening by the chimney place..

Not, as one might suppose, the doomed young love between Salvatore and Elena (a love he fails to recapture), but the pure father/son love between the local cinema projectionist, Alfredo and the fatherless Salvatore. The essential beauty of this film-long relationship is brought home in the greatest final scene any film in history ever had (IMHO). This has the hairs on the back of my neck stand to attention every single time I've seen it.With the themes this film addresses, it could so easily have been a gloop of mawkishness sentimentality. Sure, it has sentiments but there is a difference. The first time I saw this film I couldn't think or speak for over an hour afterwards (still a record).The Theatrical version is the one to see, for me, because the director's cut, whilst it adds information, does not add anything artistically at the cost of 50 extra minutes.

It's a nice composure of friendship between a poor boy who is enthusiastic about cinema and a projectionist. Yeah! Friendship can break the shackles of age! It is a beautiful story of a cinema hall from an old village where all the villagers finds there zone to take entertainment during their leisures. After ending this movie I want to say that the world of cinema is beautiful,simultaneously our life is beautiful cause we surrounded with beautiful people here just like the projectionist.

417,musso,Director's cut is a very different movie,8,29 January 2006,"The original Cinema Paradiso is my personal favorite of all time. I've just recently seen the Director's cut, and I can't emphasize enough how very different it is from the original, in theme. It does far more than just fill in plot gaps you may have thought existed in the original.I noticed at least one poster pointing out that the Director's cut is darker. I think that is an understatement. Alfredo's love for Toto is no longer pure and innocent, but instead misguided, and maybe even intentionally destructive. Afredo's underhanded efforts to keep Toto and Elena apart from each other were like the manipulations of an overprotective parent who, believing he/she knows what's best for the child, alters the course of the child's entire adult life without the child ever realizing it.Alfredo made a choice that should have belonged to Toto. Career over love. Alfredo didn't believe true love exists in real life, but only in the movies. And in the end, all that Alfredo has to offer Toto are those glimpses of movie love that can never be real. I find this incredibly sad.Amazingly, that very same final scene in the original version, rather than being the tragic result of a life-changing deception, is a celebration of Alfredo's pure love for Toto. I say ""pure"" because, in the original, Alfredo is not responsible for the separation of Toto and Elena; that comes about merely because of chance or fate. What we are left with then in the original, regarding Alfredo, is what I believe to be the ultimate act of love a parent can give a child: after preparing the child for life, pushing the child away, into the real world, at great pain to the parent. This Alfredo does, and it's portrayed with great emotion.The Director's cut has to stand on its own as a very good film. But the original remains my personal favorite for its joyful portrayal of a man's struggle to live life with the help of a loving surrogate father -- a life whose hard edges are not the result of a betrayed trust.",Cinema Paradiso

419,pakoko-38809,A Cinematic Paradise,10,14 May 2019,"Nostalgia plays like a film in your head, projecting both the good and bad memories - and then it leaves you with a sense of longing for wanting to relive those memories because of what they have given to you. Cinema Paradiso captures this bittersweet essence of nostalgia and delivers an honest message of never taking your past for granted and treasuring it as an important part of who you are. Cinema Paradiso is a beautifully orchestrated film that successfully combines the coming-of-age story of a filmmaker with great acting, fitting background visuals, and Ennio Morricone's brilliantly composed soundtrack that amplifies the emotions evoked throughout the film.Coming-of-age stories are by no means the formula for a box office hit. However, they are appealing because they are simply about life itself. There is no ultimate ""villain"" that needs to be defeated or a ""happily ever after"" after meeting the love of your life - just a person going through the motions of life and experiencing all of its ups and downs as they come. This relatable aspect is what made Cinema Paradiso so enjoyable, even if the life of the protagonist, Salvatore di Vita (aka ""Toto""), was far different from my own. Regardless, whether it was Toto losing his Father to the war, falling madly in love with Elena, or enlisting in the army and then returning home to find his old job had replaced him, all of these experiences and how Toto dealt with them felt genuine and real. The film succeeded in evoking a sense of nostalgia for the character completely unrelated to me, which speaks volumes on the ability of the actors, scriptwriters, and the director. Another aspect that I found enjoyable was that the film reminded people of the simpler times when entertainment was a rarity and not yet a commodity. Every film showing was a big social event and it brought everyone in town together, young and old, healthy and sick, men and women alike. Watching all the emotions that audience members went through while watching these films also evoked a strong sense of nostalgia in me, even when I have never lived, or can imagine living, in such a time period.This coming-of-age story is then made even better thanks to its great actors, background visuals, and phenomenal soundtrack. I personally want to praise the two actors that acted out the child and teenage versions of Toto. While the former perfectly captured the innocence of a child who was compassionate but also wildly curious about everything, the latter perfectly captured the naiveté of a teenager when it came to love and life in general. The actor that played Alfredo captured the dimwitted nature of the character well but also his deep compassion and love for Toto. The background visuals are worth noting for its simplicity and looking ironically like a movie set in the beginning. Then there is a drastic change when Toto returns to his hometown after 30 years, in which there are paved roads and new buildings. I thought this change, along with the demolition of ""Cinema Paradiso,"" was symbolic of Toto moving on to pursue his dreams of a filmmaker and leaving behind his hometown and its old memories. Conveying this sense of time passing through background visuals and using that to symbolize the maturity of Toto was definitely a nice cinematographic touch. Finally, the music from Ennio Morricone is the driving force behind what makes this film truly a classic. The soundtrack is fittingly sentimental; even with its gripping melodies, it never feels like the emotions are overflowing during the scenes. The soundtrack also amplifies the feeling of nostalgia that I have felt throughout the film, especially when Toto cried tears of joy watching a series of kissing scenes that he treasured as a child, painstakingly spliced together by Alfredo before he passed away.Cinema Paradiso is an unforgettable film in which the story, actors, background visuals, and soundtrack all come together like a well-coordinated dance and produce an end result of what I would call a ""cinematic phenomenon."" If you are a fan of coming-of-age films or simply want to try another genre, then I highly recommend visiting this little cinematic paradise on your next film venture.",Cinema Paradiso

426,hotlimbo,Unforgettable,10,7 January 2007,"I just saw the director's cut after an hiatus of about 10 years since the last time I saw the shorter version of the Cinema Paraiso. The difference between the two versions does not take away from the immeasurable quality and sublime way of telling a story of either film. The director's cut does change the focus from the prominence of the love of Alfredo for Toto (Salvatore) in the shorter version to the love between Salvatore and Elena in the longer version. The shorter and longer versions are like watching two movies for the price of one.The subtle change of extended story line between the two versions should be studied by all film students who want to take up editing as a career. It is amazing how the absence of some material and the addition of others can develop to such equally impressive but different conclusions. In the first film the closure of Elena's role turns out to be final. In the second and longer version the doors are reopened slightly and maybe, just maybe, they may reunite and dispel some of Salvatore's lonely existence later on in his life. The shorter version is certainly more of a devised film (in a very good way). Gaps are left for us to fill in with our own interpretations of what could or could not have been. This is true of all art where the author of the work leaves us some space to imagine our own input or contribution to the film. The second film is more cathartic than the first, or more expositional  letting us identify more with the elements of the story than invent them where we seek explanations. Case in point, again, the relationship with Elena: we imagine that she disappears and marries, under her father's orders, to some miserable ""banking"" husband and is lost to the bliss she could have had with Salvatore (at least, that is my invention of what could have happened to her). In the second version she seeks Salvatore so much she marries the next best thing she can find: Boccia  the closest person she can get that approximates him, especially after he has disappeared to Rome.Phew, that the two versions can become two different movies at the same time and still leave me weeping. Wow! I don't even want to start on the excellent photography, the music score, the subtlety of the story telling and the tremendously gifted cast. I kneel and then prostrate humbly before the makers of this most exquisite work of art.",Cinema Paradiso

First time around, this film was a wonderful experience. The whole film very gradually works towards a final scene which pushed all the right buttons and had me in tears (as those of you who know the film [and me] may well expect). Now, I can understand why some people might think that this film is engineered for the effect of the last scene but, for me, its wonder lies in repeat viewing. This film is about nostalgia. It can be felt reliving Toto's childhood on each viewing. Together with the characters (""the square is mine!""), the familiarity of the Sicilian village, and the evocative music score, the film improves each time I watch it.

The acting is one dimensional, just like the characters, and the pathos and the writing. It's a series of cute and fun vignettes with a few hardships thrown in for sympathy. Life is going too good at the cinema paradiso and the whole cute Alfredo as angry old man and Toto as precocious young boy has become played out, therefore, fire. Next, we see a shallow adolescent who falls in love with someone he doesn't really know. The relationship is not believable as being anything other than a juvenile infatuation and yet this is what later causes him such sorrow when he returns. Nothing is really shown about him being in the army except a comedic montage and the only time the main protagonist seems to get angry is near the end in the car, otherwise, always swooning or happy. The scene in the car is about the only interesting scene in the film yet it is not believable as following from the relationship they had. The film is thus emotionally vacuous, too long, and clichéd. It had some potential but nothing was sufficiently developed for it to be anything except hollow and unnatural.",Cinema Paradiso

This great Italian movie takes us on a trip through the life of Salvatore (aka Toto). Salvatore recalls his childhood when coming back to his hometown for the funeral of Alfredo, the theater projectionist. The relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo is the center of the story and we can't help to be warmth by it. Alfredo also passed to Salvatore all is knowledge about traditional cinema helping him to make the first steps in cinematography.Salvatore also remembers his first love, Elena, and tries to understand why they didn't stay together. When he finally understands it, he is devastated.The movie give us also a hint of the beginning of cinema for masses, church restrictions on cinema and changes in cinema through time. The last scene is one of the best ever made: emotional and beautiful. I always feel my eyes wet.After the movie, I only could think: Do we really have to choose between two lives?

Nuovo Cinema Paradiso allows to temporarily abandon ourselves to innocence, and at least in my case, always causes a smile to lurk up.Some may think its portrayals of love, loss, and friendship are naive in their presentation, but it helps guide you through the persona's journey, which in certain instances resembles the emotions we go through at different points in our life. The film itself is fairly simple in its delivery, which in turn, helps the viewer identify with the characters thoughts, struggles, and emotions.I strongly recommend this film for anyone who appreciates simplicity, and wishes to experience a film that has the ability to make you laugh, cry, think, and reminisce on the moments in our life that you will always treasure.",Cinema Paradiso

Giuseppe Tornatore expresses his overpowering love of movies by giving his viewers a genuinely magnificent movie to love and treasure. The final scene is a perfect blend of film editing and soundtrack music. Anyone whose eyes are still dry half way into that glorious scene needs to see a cardiologist ASAP. Cudos to the great Ennio Morricone & son Andrea. Many reviewers insist that the shorter, theatrical-release version is superior to the director's cut. The full-length version makes a central character morally ambiguous, in contrast to the uniformly benevolent father figure depicted in the shorter version. In the long version this character commits an act similar to but far crueler than the behavior of another character who is ridiculed early on. Most new viewers will watch the full-length film. The shorter version is more satisfying for those who secretly prefer fairy tales in which the good guys & bad guys are consistently good guys & bad guys.

458,YourNewAesthetic,"amazing film, but beware of director's cut",10,25 March 2003,"I am going to start this by warning anyone who has yet to see the director's cut of Cinema Paradiso: DO NOT WATCH THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!  I know everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but I am saying this because I viewed both versions of Cinema Paradiso in my film class (123 min. version first, followed by the 170 min. director's cut), and with the exception of one person, everyone in the class wished that they had not seen it.  At the very least, if you must watch the director's cut, I urge you, no, I implore you, to make sure you watch the 123 min version first.  If you watch the 170 min version first, you are robbing yourself of a great experience you will never be able to reclaim; watching the 170 min version first WILL ruin the 123 min version.After we first viewed the 123 min version, there wasn't a single person in my class that wasn't amazed by what they had just seen.  It is an amazing story of the magic of film and the cinema, highlighted by great performances and some of the most beautiful cinematography I have ever seen.  There are very few films that I consider to be near-perfect, but the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso has made that list.  Some people complain that the 123 min version leaves a lot unanswered, but the beauty of it is that it doesn't matter.  Though love and Toto's relationship with Elena are involved, they aren't the focus of the 123 min version.  The focus of that version is on the relationship between Alfredo and Toto, and their shared love and enchantment with the cinema and film.It is a powerfully emotional film, but, sadly, this level of emotion is lost in the director's cut.  In attempting to clean up any loose ends or unanswered questions, the film is considerably bogged down by details and the magic and emotion of the 123 min version is lost.  The focus of the entire story is shifted, and rather than solely being the story of the relationship between Toto and Alfredo, the film takes on the extra task of juggling the story of the relationship between Toto and Elena as well.  In doing so, both storylines suffer, and the power the 123 min version holds is greatly reduced.  The result is a complicated mess of answers (many of which only raise more questions), that after seeing leave you wishing you hadn't. In the end you crave for that initial sense of magic and emotion the 123 min version provided to come back, but for some it is all too late.  I know it's tempting to watch the director's cut, but this is one occasion where you shouldn't indulge your curiosity.  Sadly, the 170 min director's cut version taints the beauty and magic of the 123 min version of Cinema Paradiso, and that is one treasure that should never be lost.",Cinema Paradiso

The actors that had the privilege to be part of this movie were truly brilliant throughout, and deserve to be credited with at least a 9/10 rating.

I myself am of Italian nationality and it was truly wonderful to see a good Italian movie, with a great story line as well as great actors and comedic relief where it was needed. The nice thing is that if you don't want to watch it with subtitles, you can change the language.

474,xjunkmailx,If you want a good review...,9,12 December 2004,"Note: These are just segments from an analytical paper I wrote for my History of Film class. I had to trim it down from its original state. Enjoy!Cinema Paradiso is an Academy Award (1990) winning film that portrays the 'coming-of- age' of a young boy from a small Sicilian village. The film brings to life a young boy's passion for movies and relentless pursuit of the girl of his dreams. Since its debut in the late 1980s, this timeless film has made audiences worldwide fall in love with the cinema. It encapsulates a renowned filmmaker's nostalgic flashback to his younger years and the people and events that left a profound impact on the course of his life. Salvatore is a precocious young boy who befriends a middle aged film projectionist at the onset of WWII. In the small Sicilian village, Salvatore serves as an alter boy in the Catholic Church, but he always has only one thing on his mind. Movies. The young boy is completely mesmerized by the movies of the era and often sneaks into the local theater, cinema paradiso, to watch as the priest censors the films for the townspeople. It is quickly made evident that the paradiso is not merely a movie theater, but rather, it serves as the fabric that binds a closely-knit and diverse community. The often frictional, but primarily tender, relationship between Salvatore and Alfredo grows when Alfredo takes his young friend under his wing and teaches him how to operate the film projector. As Salvatore grows into a young man he divides his time between attending high school and operating the film projector in the new cinema paradiso. It isn't long before a beautiful girl moves to the village and Salvatore falls head-over-heals in love with her the second she catches his eye. At first, Elena does not reciprocate Salvatore's affection, but after he woos her at every chance he gets, she finally embraces his love for her. As Salvatore and Elena's romance blossoms, Salvatore finds his desires and natural talents inhibited by the 'small town life,' while Elena prepares to continue her studies at the University. The height of his frustration is depicted in a scene where he is works as an intern film projectionist at an outdoor theater in small coastal village. While lying on a dock he looks up at the stars and utters, 'When will this bloody summer end. In a film it'd already be over. Cut, and there's a storm. Wouldn't that be great?' Within an instant it starts to pour and Elena suddenly appears to ease away his pain. In the background, a film is portraying heroic characters overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles to succeed in the end. The scene is symbolic of the struggles that Salvatore had to endure as he matured. For instance, the loss of his father during WWII, his frictional relationship with his mother, coping with the loss of love, prolonged military service, and the building up of courage to leave his small town to realize his true potential, are all examples of some of the personal struggles that defined his character. It isn't long before the summer comes to a poignant close and Elena departs for University. Even though he is blind, Alfredo truly sees that the small town life is not the right fit for Salvatore and he advises him to leave, do not return, and, 'never give in to nostalgia.' It was director, Giuseppe Tornatore's, intention to create Cinema Paradiso as a sort of 'eulogy' for the way great film-making used to be done. In his masterpiece, he pays homage to the works of Renoir and Visconti by presenting a tenderly nostalgic piece done in a genuine and unpretentious manner. The film conveys its message in a simply eloquent manner without subjecting viewers to over dramatization. Throughout the film, the superb cinematography of Blasco Giurato is accompanied by an emotionally inspiring score by Ennio Morricone. The music is seemingly tailored to each particular scene and reflects and evokes specific emotions. Cinema Paradiso is nothing short of flawless.Cinema Paradiso is a sentimental tribute to the Hollywood romances of the 'Golden Age' of cinema, woven around the tragic love saga of a renowned filmmaker that missed out on a true 'Hollywood ending.' During a moment alone with Salvatore ('Toto'), Alfredo sums up the basis of the film, 'No, Toto. Nobody said it. This time it's all me. Life isn't like in the movies. Life is much harder.' In a humble fashion, the film presents a bitter sweet story that, in one way or another, audiences can relate to. The personal connections and string of emotions evoked by Cinema Paradiso is proof that it is truly more than just a movie; it is a classic among classics. 9/10",Cinema Paradiso
475,davspin,Profoundly important movie,10,25 December 2004,"Cinema Paradiso is a profoundly important movie because it deals with identifiable emotions/issues that could be considered universal on so many levels. The entire story is retrospective similar to Fellini's style as well as a love story that pulls in the viewer on an emotional level. The film also attempts to expose an inkling of Sicilian life, language,(different from Italian) and how ""history"" has intruded upon and shaped the mentality of the Sicilian people; to also show that traditional concepts of what is ""moral"" or right is not to be taken for granted because of the people and their particular history. For those who do not fancy history or non-fiction, the film attempts to educate the ""outsider"" not familiar with Sicilian history as it pertains to the WWII era. I watch it again and again and see more and more details that pertain to the story. I did see it on the big screen at a local theater back in 1991 and it was a hit with the audience. I have several scenerio that I think could make it more interesting and am very curious about the uncut version and what is different about it. Finally, the movie does make me cry because it is after all a love story and it is clear at the end that Toto (aka Salvatore)is still in love with Elena and that is why he never married or settled down ""..to love one person. . . "" as his mother says to him after his 30 year absence from home. The final scene of the credits also shows him looking at Elena again and the look on his face is telling. This film has many little ""hints"" that serve to inform the viewer and give just a little more info. about the story. Truly, one of the best films I have ever seen !!! These characters come alive and we feel like we know them--personally. Viva Giuseppe Tornatore for his masterpiece!",Cinema Paradiso
476,karl-sokhn,Infinitely Innocent,8,20 August 2013,"We all have had moments when we seemed to cling to past sensations or childhood memories, we feel a certain comfort re invoking these thoughts into mind. That is exactly what Cinema Paradiso portrays in an almost 3 hour long movie all through which you don't budge. Allow me to explain : The past is an ambiguous word but to clarify, let's consider the past as the numerous events that lead to NOW, the present. Having said that, the movie is a picture perfect depiction of the influence of the past on one's present and future. Childhood, teenage crisis, first love, the search for one's roots etc.. I shall detail these headlines. This movie represents the main character Salvatore Di Vita,a bright little kid who, never met or had any kind of interaction with his father(a soldier in the Italian army). And Alfredo, an old man with no kids who takes care of film reels in the Cinema Paradiso. (The only downside of the Cinema Paradiso was that films were censored and scenes involving physical contact were cut from the reels). Many actions lead their relationship to strengthen throughout the movie even though their bond had an inherent tendency to grow because each of them found in the other what he was lacking. Alfredo soon becomes the father figure Salvatore longed for as a kid and the little boy starts seeking counsel with the elder in matters that he couldn't understand. He becomes the prominent person that represents Salvatore's childhood along with the Cinema Paradiso, the place where Salvatore cultivated a love for Cinematography. And finally Elena, Salvatore's one true love draws the final stroke on this amazing portrait : Giancaldo, Salvatore's home village. Outer Circumstances force Elena and Salvatore to be separated, and their attempts to communicate fall on deaf ears and they lose all kinds of contact. A while after that Alfredo's counsel leads Salvatore(Toto) to leave the cradle of his childhood in order to pursue his dreams. He returns several years after to attend Alfredo's funeral and starts to rediscover Giancaldo from an other point of view and is finally able to make peace with his past with Alfredo's posthumous help. Finally i would like to add that the movie has an air of innocence to it and an immensely frivolous atmosphere giving all the characters' feelings a sincerity that i have never seen in any other movie.",Cinema Paradiso
477,Oracle2959,A Diamond In A Mound Of Dirt,10,2 August 2005,"What words can possibly be added that have not been written 100 times before. If you have not seen this movie then no words can do it justice. If you have seen this movie than you know it's beyond words. This movie speaks to each viewer in a silent language. A language that only one film in every decade or two speaks. A language that stirs your soul and causes you to re-examine your own life and your goals. A language that is universal across all races and countries. It speaks to that part of you that you rarely show or share with anyone other than yourself. It speaks of loves lost, loves found and loves yet discovered. It speaks to the creative part of you that instinctively knows that doing something without passion and intense love is not worth it no matter the reward.It's a shame that this film had to be butchered down to 2 hours just so American audience's notoriously short attention spans would not be tested. There is only one true Cinema Paradiso. That is the 3 hour version originally released in Europe.That said, I would recommend anyone new to this movie to watch the 2 hour American version first. Then settle back and get ready for the ride of your life by watching the 3 hour original version as the director intended you to see it. If you do not speak Italian use the sub-titles. Do not however replace the Italian with any dubbed version. That will kill it. The Italian voice inflections are what makes this film a poem translated magically to the screen.How long would you search for your passion until you gave up? How empty would your life be without that passion? Could another passion ever take the place of the original passion? Slip this DVD in your player, turn the lights down low and discover for yourself the magic of an all consuming passion.",Cinema Paradiso
478,jamiethompson1,Utterly awful,1,27 March 2005,"This is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I'm quite a big fan of foreign language film, but this gives the ""genre"" a bad name. It's about an annoying little s*** of a boy annoying an old man, stealing things, etc. And it has boys chugging in the cinema, and a couple going at it hammer and tongs.Good films contain things that you might remember positively or which affect you. The only affect this had on me was wanting to never go to Italy and smashing the DVD into little bits with a huge hammer. It doesn't even make sense.I got this free with a newspaper and it's not even worth that. Horrific.",Cinema Paradiso
479,l_schoorl,fantastic...,10,6 November 2005,"This movie to me is the best I have ever seen. Never has any piece of art touched me the way that this film has. No song, composition, painting, opera, concert or book has ever left me feeling so totally fulfilled.The first time I saw Cinema Paradiso I watched the 3 hour long Director's cut version with my two best mates and our girlfriends. When the final 'Fine' appeared on screen, all six of us were crying our eyes out. Not just a couple of tears running down our cheeks: Sobbing like a bunch of two-year-olds. We were all still crying and hadn't said a word long after the credits finished rolling.I just watched it for the second time with my girl, and we were both crying even harder and longer than the first time.Being an artist myself I can only dream of ever creating a work as complete and moving as Cinema Paradiso.",Cinema Paradiso
480,chr-knudsen,The most important film in my life.,10,22 April 2019,"Cinema Paradiso is one of the few movies, that I watch every second year or so.
Every time an emotional rollercoaster where you laugh and cry.
The only movie that pulls out every romantic and emotional side of you and make you cry like never before.A film about love for movies, friendship and most important about strong, untamed and hopeless love between two persons.
It's not a ""happy end"" movie, but there's also something beautiful in experiencing unhappiness.
An important player in this movie is also the beautiful music by Ennio Morricone and my favourite actor/actress is Jacques Perrin, who plays the older Totò.",Cinema Paradiso
481,jafghanik,Cinema Parasiso - An Inspiration to Filmmakers.,10,25 September 2015,"Before watching Cinema Parsdiso, I was just a film buff, watching, analyzing, and finding out the concept behind making a film. After watching this movie, I literally cried because it was the story of my childhood. That is how I exactly spent my childhood. I immediately realized that I ain't just a film buff, I am a Filmmaker. Coming to the review part of this movie, the story telling style of Giussepe is so unique and nostalgic that while you see the people sitting inside Theater reacting to on-screen emotions is classic and makes us feel we are part of them inside Nuovo Paradiso Theater. Alfredo is a great teacher and projectionist who lived Films all his life. Toto at the same time has just discovered his love for cinema. The beauty of cinema Paradiso is on one hand there's Alfredo who dreams to become a filmmaker however he couldn't because he's the only projectionist in Town and on the other hand there's Toto who's desperate about Films and wants to become friends with Alfredo to watch & learn films. However A school exam decides whether they gonna be friends or not. Adult 'Toto' recollects his memory and childhood experience in the village. The Gift Alfredo had kept all this while for Toto is Alfredo's experience as a single audience. Cinema Paradiso is a beautiful experience that you will remember all your life. Thank you Cinema Paradiso for making me realize my passion for Films.",Cinema Paradiso
482,pozzo-lahiri,A touching story and at the same time technically brilliant!,9,23 July 2005,"One of the greatest I've ever seen, Tornatore pulls off masterfully a movie which is technically brilliant and at the same time pulls at the viewers heartstrings! Viva La Tornatore! Grande! Later Tornatore directed MALENA, it is also a great movie, but it never reaches the greatness achieved by CINEMA PARADISO. The movie shows the diverse nature of the crowd present at a movie theater, people in all kinds of moods, as Roger Ebert said,""Romances are launched in the darkness of the theater, friendships are sealed, wine is drunk, cigarettes smoked, babies nursed, feet stomped, victories cheered, sissies whistled at...""! The movie sometimes reminds us of Fellini, especially when in the long shots someone suddenly appears in close up. Like Truffuat, Tornatore gives a special place to posters in this movie. 'This film captures the essence of a man's life, gently bringing us from childhood to middle age believably and beautifully.' There is a presence of warmth and humor in the movie, from the fainting lottery winner to the zealous censorious priest, and the madman who goes on saying, ""This square is mine""! It is sometimes sad, sometimes funny, sometimes poignant but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying. It is one of a kind. Salvatore is present in all of us. And when Alfredo says, ""Living here day by day, you think it's the center of the world. You believe nothing will ever change. Then you leave: a year, two years. When you come back, everything's changed. The thread's broken. What you came to find isn't there. What was yours is gone. You have to go away for a long time... many years... before you can come back and find your people. The land where you were born. But now, no. It's not possible. Right now you're blinder than I am."" --- it applies to all of us on a universal level. And the music? It is brilliant, romantic and never fails to touch the heart, kudos to Ennio Morricone. The movie is perfect, beautiful and to describe in one word: BELLISSIMA!",Cinema Paradiso

A beautiful film that captures the magic of the movies and the beauty of friendship and the way in which the experiences in our childhood plant seeds that bear fruit later. What a triumph in film making. I am NOT a deep thinker. I am NOT a foreign movie buff, though I have seen many. I am just an average Jane. To me, that this movie could mean so much to someone who is just ""regular folk"" says a lot about the way in which it was made. I have a really hard time describing this movie to recommend it to people. I pretty much just say, ""Oh, it is magic. Incredible. You will love it."" But then when I try to explain the plot, I realize it is such a simple plot and most people look at me like I am an idiot. As if, ""what could possibly be interesting about that?""

488,jamiek-27013,"A true story of love, loneliness, passion, and faith.",8,21 November 2016,"Cinema Paradiso was a satisfying Italian film that has won numerous awards. I watched it with English subtitles. I was immediately pleased that I could pick up some basic phrases in the beginning, as it opened with a telephone conversation. I was quickly drawn into the plot as the scene flashed from a handsome, distinguished gentleman quietly reflected on his relationship that had spanned many years and experiences and shaped his life, with his dear friend, Alfredo. The young Toto, with all his mischievous, bright- eyed wonder, was impossible not to love. And the hard-talking Italian film operator, Alfredo, had a soft side that was evident through his way of protecting the young boy. The impact of the cinema on a community was nostalgic. There was a careful balance that seemed to never be disrupted between the growing Toto and his mentor, with the stakes growing higher each new phase of growth. Beautiful was the love story of tentative, curiously exploration as Toto came of age, easy to relate to, and certainly pulled at the heart strings. We see Toto grow from a boy operator in one city, to far away from where he came from, older, wiser, perhaps a little lonely. By the end of the film, we too are wistfully reminiscent of the old days of Cinema Paradiso and sweet, innocent love. One thing is for certain by the end of this film: There is no certainty except life moves forward and all good things come to an end. – Jamie K.",Cinema Paradiso

490,josecarlos-3,a new movie is done at this almost 3 hours version.,10,1 May 2006,"There is a melodramatic movie in old version. It is beautiful, touching, sweeter than deserves it and nothing more.There is a Movie masterpiece, astonishing, in new version. Please puts in garbage the 2 hours version. It don't need to be look. The Ennio Morricone music is great, it just lost in beautiful for Morricone's Once upon a time in America, maybe the best sound track in movie history. Actors are not all in their best but Alfredo, Toto as an adult and as a child ( Salvatore is a phenomenal child ) fulfill the needs. The whole history is just like a dream with painful and good memories. And you don't need to know if the history is out in screen. It is into you. Everyone lost so many thing as a child. Everyone has the right to see in maturity what our early decisions means in our future. The movie climate remembers Marcel Proust, Sergio Leone, and many artists who try to understand Time, Memory and Past.Jose Carlos",Cinema Paradiso
491,zgrgic,Perfection achieved by simplicity,10,11 October 2005,"A delightful film that brings together all the aspects of story telling. There is no need for murder, sex or humour to bring this together, all it required was a a small town and a simple relationship between a little boy and a man.The movie leads you on in such an easy and enchanting way that you are compelled to the screen to see how this all unfolds. Over my years I have had similar experiences and can fully relate to the story line.The secret in this story is that nothing was wasted, all aspects had an eventual meaning and the ending was shear delight. Hollywood should take a closer look at this movie and perhaps learn how perfection through simplicity can be achieved.",Cinema Paradiso

This coming-of-age film is extremely thought-provoking, poetic, and evocative. It makes you feel as though you are a part of the movie and that you actually live in this small town in southern Italy and know all of the characters personally. My advice to anyone who has not seen it before is first of all, to see it as soon as possible, and second of all, to make sure that you are in a relaxed mood and you are in quiet area with no distractions around before watching. After that, just sit back, unwind, and truly grasp this remarkable film.",Cinema Paradiso

It is a masterpiece created by a director who himself is in love with cinema. No special effects, just a great story, brilliantly conceived, directed and shot, captivating acting by perfectly cast actors and yet another inspired soundtrack from the genius Ennio Morricone. The shorter version delivers as much enjoyment but the full version is more satisfying as it closes the circle. I defy anyone not to be captivated by it!

497,marcyfiorica,Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the most perfect film,10,16 January 2006,"I consider Nuovo Cinema Paradiso is the most perfect film because of all three of the major ingredients in films of this century are considered important. One, the acting was exceptional good, in the way the very young ""Toto"" was very convincing in acting his age in post war Italy and then the teen-age ""Toto"" was excellent in showing a boy becoming a man in war time Italy and showing a beginning interest in the wonder and love of films, by experiencing the films shown in the town's only movie theater and even making them himself and then the adult ""Toto"" was also excellent in the end of movie when it was apparent that he has to have films to survive his everyday world of making them too. The second one is the direction and I am including the third one, the writing one here too. The director was very correct in showing us the life of this town surrounding the nightly showings of the movies in the Cinema Paradiso theater. I am very involve in this movie each time I see it, I start daydreaming that I am actuals a member of that community and seeing the movies at Cinema Paradiso movie theater in that same Italian town, in which ""Toto"" grew up in.",Cinema Paradiso
498,Darkest-Angel,A Note From Someone Of 14...,10,8 January 2006,"I am not exactly that old. I'm not exactly a film buff or anything, but I watch films that my dad brings and tells me are good. Sometimes my sister has something interesting to offer too. When my dad showed me this film, I thought; 'Oh dear, another one?' but proceeded to watch it with him. It pulled me into a world where dreams can come true. The film was fascinating, I watched it with the kind of reverence children save for The Teletubbies. I watched the film and it opened within me a new kind of person, someone who won't give up, someone who is constantly trying to get better at something. But the part of the film that struck me most was the part when Toto returns home and goes into his bedroom and we see his first film reel, the pictures of the young Toto and Alfredo. It's like Alfredo was almost a father figure for Toto. That's the only part of the film that made me cry. Another similar film I saw recently was ""A Touch Of Spice"", a Greek film that my sister brought home. It is also very heart-wrenching film, much like Cinema Paradiso, but with a different storyline. I highly recommend this film; but I won't talk about it any more and spoil it! Cinema Paradiso is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen, something Hollywood has really got to learn from. The thing that makes a good film is emotion, not special effects or famous actors or actresses.",Cinema Paradiso

Well, once again I'm so convinced that this is what outstanding movie making is all about. You name it: excellent performances of all the cast, impeccable cinematography and editing, amazing soundtrack, ideal use of flashbacks and story telling ... and I could keep on naming all the variables and every one of them is better and gets better with time. I wish Tornatore did more films because he's really one of the best directors in the world. I won't reveal any part of the story, even though the film was released in 1989.
