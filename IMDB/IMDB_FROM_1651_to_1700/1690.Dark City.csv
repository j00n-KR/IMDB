0,MartinHafer,Brilliant--at last a truly original sci-fi film!,9,28 November 2008,"This is one of the more difficult films to describe. Part of this is because I really don't want to ruin the suspense for anyone who has yet to see the film. Part of it is because this sci-fi film is so incredibly ""foreign""--having very little in common with previous sci-fi films. I loved the fact that there were no robots, space battles or a traditional quest and hero. Lovers of adventure-oriented sci-fi may dislike this and many may be put off by the dark tone and colors of the film which give it almost a Film Noir quality. However, if you have longed for something that is not derivative or predictable, then this film is for you! The film starts off in a dark 1940s-like world. In many ways, it looks like post-WWII America--with the fashions, buildings and hair styles. Yet, despite the presence of fedora hats and old time cars, something is not right. You see, this place can't be Earth because it's forever night! And, to top this off, periodically everything stops--everything. And then, seemingly from out of no where, odd looking aliens (who look a lot like Uncle Fester, the guy from HELLRAISER and Nosferatu combined) appear and begin doing strange experiments on the people. Oddly, however, after seemingly doing this for years, one of the subjects does NOT fall asleep when the others do and he realizes that there is something very, very wrong. Much of the rest of the film consists of these nightmarish creatures pursuing him--trying to stop the one guinea pig who is different from the rest.Bizarre and possessing a terrific otherworldliness that no other film can replicate, DARK CITY is amazingly original, tense and worth seeing. However, for those who want cute sci-fi like ET or STAR WARS, you may be disappointed--this film is far from cute and is not a film oriented towards kids.",Dark City
1,Leofwine_draca,Outstanding sci-fi film noir,8,23 March 2013,"THE CROW director Alex Proyas followed up his stylish debut with this even more stylish slice of sci-fi film noir. It's a complex yet eminently watchable beast, featuring a twisted, world-changing plot and using all manner of innovative ideas to create a true work of science fiction. Where THE MATRIX took a sci-fi principle and used it as a basis for a straightforward action flick, DARK CITY remains about the ideas and their implications all the way through.The film kicks off as a straightforward murder mystery, featuring the ever underrated Rufus Sewell (in a rare Hollywood good guy role) as a wronged man on the run from the authorities. So far so Hitchcock, but throw in a dogged cop (William Hurt, who's never been better) and a series of repugnant baldies led by the camp but excellent Richard O'Brien, and you have the recipe for one uniquely thrilling film.There are missteps along the way, including the infamously bad judgement of the studio to include an opening narration which makes redundant all the genuine twists and surprises later on in the story, but for the most part this is an exhilarating slice of film-making and much more mature than the better known Keanu Reeves-starrer. Proyas elicits some fascinating performances from his assembled cast, including an alluring debut for Aussie starlet Melissa George, a creepy turn for British character actor Ian Richardson, a bug-eyed role for MAD MAX 2's Bruce Spence, Jennifer Connelly as a paragon of virtue and the surprisingly excellent Kiefer Sutherland, cast against type as a twitchy doctor whose role owes much to Peter Lorre. The special effects involving the buildings are superb and the film as a whole is a refreshingly original piece of sci-fi done on a grand scale.",Dark City
2,SnoopyStyle,wonderful dark design,8,30 August 2015,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) has lost his memory and wakes up in a hotel with a dead body. Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) is chasing after a serial killer and suspects Murdoch. Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) is also searching for Murdoch and contacts his wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly). Schreber has been working with a mysterious group called The Strangers who have special powers. The Strangers confront Murdoch and find that he also can 'tune', the ability to change reality. He is looking to go to Shell Beach but nobody can remember how to get there. At the stroke of midnight, the population becomes unconscious and the world is reformed.This is a great sci-fi movie with an unique vision. Of course, it's dark. It's also a wonderfully rich hard-boiled 50s world. Director Alex Proyas adds depth to his design from The Crow. He borrows from the greats and influences many others following this. The story works well within its own logic. I think most has the world figured out by the midway point but The Strangers are still a bit murky to the end. They do need a clearer exposition that is more than Schreber's explanations. The climax is a bit too confusing but it is visually weird. It becomes a mind battle and that's a difficult thing to achieve cinematically.",Dark City
3,Prismark10,Not Neo Enough,6,13 July 2016,"Rufus Sewell plays John Murdoch in this grungy science fiction thriller which has the look of a 1940s Film Noir. Murdoch lives in a vast dark city which is no to dissimilar to Batman's Gotham City. Murdoch might also be a murderer but he really is not sure of his memories.The city is overrun by the Strangers, a ghostly and bald alien race with special powers that live in human cadavers. They want to understand humanity. They are helped by a human scientist (Kiefer Sutherland) who extracts memories from people and injects them into other human bodies. Murdoch was given the mind of a serial killer but something went wrong.Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) is looking for a serial killer preying on prostitutes and Murdoch might be his man. Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connelly) is the wife looking for her missing husband. However the Strangers want to get hold of Murdoch but he seem to be very resistant and could even expose the heart of this city where it never seems to get light.The film came out a year before The Matrix but it is the latter film that hit the big box office jackpot. The Matrix had zeitgeist this has not. The film feels to derivative and lacks freshness. The interior setting in a place where it is always night just looks like a big movie sound stage not matter how dazzling the art direction which are inspired by Edward Hopper paintings and German Expressionist cinema.Proyas does create wonderful visuals which are now without interest but they have now aged. The editing is too choppy because when the reveal arrives it is straightforward but the director made the film convoluted to keep the mystery going.",Dark City
4,claudio_carvalho,A Timeless Cult Sci-Fi Noir that Has not Aged,9,3 April 2016,"In an undefined time and place, a group of aliens called ""Strangers"" are dying in their planet and are experimenting new options of life with humans.A amnesiac man awakens in a bathtub and receives a phone call from a Dr. Daniel Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) warning him that he should leave the hotel room since he will be captured. Before leaving the room, he finds the corpse of a woman and a knife. Soon a group of Strangers hunts him down but he succeeds to escape. Before leaving the hotel, the front desk informs that his wallet is in a restaurant. He retrieves his wallet and learns that his name is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) and is married with Emma (Jennifer Connely). He is followed by the persistent police inspector Frank Burnstead (William Hurt) that believes he is a serial- killer. Murdich also learns that he has uncontrolled powers called tuning similar to the Strangers and he flees using the powers. Murdoch notes that the city does not have daylight and every midnight the Strangers rearrange the city and change the people memories. Further, everybody knows the coastal town Shell Beach by heart but nobody knows how to go there. He teams up with Burnstead and Emma and apparently Dr. Schreber is the only human who knows what is happening in the city. What will be the fate of the humans in the hands of the Strangers?""Dark City"" is a timeless cult sci-fi noir that has not aged and uses references from other films that perfectly works. The noir style is a tribute to the period between 1939 and 1950; the ""Strangers"" and the Gothic style are visibly inspired in ""Nosferatu"" and ""Metropolis""; the aliens that take the human bodies are inspired in 'Body Snatchers"". Further, it certainly has influenced ""Matrix"" that was released one year later. The cinematography and special effects are astonishing and the performances are top-notch. Like a wine, this film seems to be better as years go by. Fortunately the writers and director have not been seduced with the success and there is no sequel of this little masterpiece. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade das Sombras"" (""City of the Darkness"")",Dark City
5,kosmasp,DC as Directors Cut,10,24 May 2020,"Also Darc City of course - but when I rewatched this the other day, I did watch the Directors cut and I only can recommend this highly. This may still (even though it apparently has won a lot of wins and nominations) be underrated - which is quite the shame.This is dark and innovative. It has great actors in it and it also really resonates on many levels. And while it is not comparable to the Matrix, I wouldn't blame people if they see some similarities at least. Just take the central character: would you be surprised if he was named Neo? He is sort of a chosen one. Having said that, this has a different story or a more contained scenario. Still quite complex and still very nicely structured (if you excuse the pun).The movie or the making of it, had quite a few hurdles to overcome. But we finally get to see what the director intended us to see. Or at least a close version of it. If you like Science Fiction, there is almost no excuse for you not to watch it. Unless it is happy go lucky Sci-Fi you are into. Nothing wrong with that, but not what you get served here",Dark City
6,classicsoncall,"""The only place home exists is in your head.""",8,3 December 2016,"For me, the picture brought up memories of a favorite comic book character of the early Eighties by the name of Grimjack, who lived in a pan-dimensional city that featured shape-shifting doors and alleyways, in which humans and aliens existed amid a world of magic and technology. The laws of physics didn't always work as expected, and one had to remember how certain things behaved in different parts of the city in order to function properly.This was a cool flick that kept you on your toes as to what was happening with the principal character, John Murdock (Rufus Sewell). With a memory completely erased by men-in-black vigilantes called The Strangers, Murdoch frantically attempts to regain his understanding of who he is, and why everyone falls asleep at midnight in a virtual reset of a programmed world. The reason he's being pursued by The Strangers has to do with his ability to 'tune', that is, he can make things happen by his will alone, a power he begins to grasp as the story moves along.Visual comparisons to films like ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Matrix"" are inevitable; it's a dark film with oddly nourish sensibilities with the inclusion of characters like torch singer Emma Murdoch (Jennifer Connolly) and police inspector Bumstead (William Hurt). Keifer Sutherland portrays an enigmatic doctor who's programming allows Murdoch to defeat The Strangers. The picture should appeal to fans of sci-fi thrillers who crave a bit of a mind bender.",Dark City
7,gavin6942,The Real Matrix -- Proyas Did It First,9,24 February 2006,"A man (Rufus Sewell) struggles with memories of his past, including a wife (Jennifer Connelly) he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun and run by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans. ""Dark City"" is quite possibly one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated films of the 1990s, yet could be also said to be one of the most influential. The general lack of interest in this film by critics and the general public is a mystery to me, since there is really not much to complain about with an action-packed (yet intelligent) plot, superb acting and some of the best visuals in many years. The very fact Roger Ebert called this the film of the year and took the time to record an entire audio commentary on this film is a testament to its greatness and may some day (though not yet) be looked back on as one of the seminal works of the 21st century.Directing this picture is Alex Proyas, best known for his work on ""The Crow"". The similar darkness makes his work obvious and there probably was not a better person to make this film. Tim Burton, also known for his dark films, would have been too strange. David Fincher could possibly have done it; yet, I think Proyas knew how to mix the past and the future in a dark world elegantly.Many people have made the comparison of this film with Fritz Lang's 1929 classic ""Metropolis""... and I definitely see it. The buildings / architecture in both as far as I can tell are very similar, though the plot differs sharply. ""Dark City"" seems to be set in the 1940s, and that is hardly a stretch from a futuristic 1929. I saw some interesting parallels with ""Uzumaki"", the Japanese horror film based on the 1998 manga. Both films feature a spiral or ""vortex"" theme... ""Dark City"" has one man become obsessed with spirals, filling his office and home with them; the serial killer carves spiral shapes into the flesh of his victims; and another man has a spiral fingerprint. While the symbolism is different in the two films, the visuals are strikingly similar.And even some allusions ""Hellraiser""... but only because the Strangers all look and dress exactly like Pinhead, or at least shop at the same bondage store. The 1990s were filmed with nihilistic films, and the costumes here reflect that sensibility. But most of all, this film is similar to ""The Matrix"" in a great multitude of ways -- and this film came first, which really undercuts ""The Matrix"". One man comes to realize the world he lives in is not all it seems -- other beings, more powerful than humans, control the real universe behind the scenes. He is brought to realize this by someone who goes between both worlds, but is not powerful enough to stop them on his own. In time, this man acquires the powers of those he is up against. Both are compared to Jesus Christ -- John Murdoch's apartment number is 614, in the Bible, John 6:14 says ""Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."" And on top of this, some of the same sets were used for both movies. So ""The Matrix"" is half the genius film some have made it out to be.Have I applauded the cast? Kiefer Sutherland, a great cult actor (""Lost Boys""). Richard O'Brien, another great cult actor (""Rocky Horror Picture Show""). And Jennifer Connelly, who is the greatest actress in the history of the universe on both this planet and on all other planets, both in this dimension and in every possible dimension. To create a dimension where Jennifer Connelly is not perfect would be impossible and against the will of God Himself. William Hurt is in this film, and you cannot deny the star power of Bill Hurt. While his character is somewhat one-dimensional in this film and does not have the range Hurt is capable of, he nonetheless filled this role with as much vivaciousness as possible. I really hoped his character, a detective, would solve the case.And the questions this film raises about love (can it be synthetic) and our memories (could we be living a false life, created by a higher power)... maybe not every day problems, but something much deeper and hard to think about without a headache. The film reminds me of Professor Daniel Putman, who would constantly challenge us to prove the universe was not created five minutes prior. (Putman, of course, was evoking Bertrand Russell's Last Thursdayism.)This film has some flaws (is Murdoch too powerful? how is a speeding taxi slower than a police officer on foot?) but is overall a priceless film. Highest possible recommendation.",Dark City
8,lee_eisenberg,a city across,7,30 May 2006,"It's been a few years since I saw ""Dark City"". I remember it as a somewhat confusing flick about amnesiac John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), trapped in a grim metropolis where the creatures who rule are after him. I agree with a previous viewer that this movie is better than ""The Matrix"" - which reused the sets - in that it's more psychological, posing the question of what makes us humans. Because we can see that the creatures who rule the city sure aren't human, but are we any better? Fascist Dr. Daniel Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) sure isn't a candidate.Anyway, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but definitely worth seeing. You may be very suspicious of your surroundings after seeing this. Also starring William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly.",Dark City
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Yes, ""Dark"" Is The Word For This Eerie & Fascinating Tale",9,31 March 2006,"NOTE: The new Director's Cut on Blu-Ray elevated this movie another ""star"" or two....see this version, it's fantastic and makes the whole story more comprehensible. The review written below was before I had seen this newer version.""Dark"" is right: this is a dark movie with dark people and dark buildings where there is no daylight until the very end of the story. It's a combination sci-fi/film noir and takes place back in the 1940s or '50s in some big city.It's alien nonsense stuff about peoples' memories taken from them so that the aliens can learn enough about earth beings to eventually take over their souls because their own race is dying, blah, blah, blah. You've seen it before. However, the story takes a back seat to the set designs and special effects, both of which are unique. I know of no other movie, before or since (it's been eight years), which shows a city literally re-shape itself each night with buildings expanding, rising, falling, etc. The visuals throughout this movie are fabulous and the sounds that go with it are good, too. There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still an ugly, sordid story and not always fun to watch even though it keeps your attention and - at least with me - draws you back for multiple viewings. There is a magnetism to this film. This is the only video I got rid twice and re-acquired it both times! As I said, Dark City keeps drawing me back. Eerie!!!",Dark City
10,rmax304823,Unfathomable Heights.,4,11 September 2012,"A man (Sewell) wakes up in a bath tub, receives a phone call from a stranger (Sutherland) hysterically urging him to depart the premises pronto, runs out into the night-time streets, and is pursued by mysterious figures in black fedoras and long black overcoats, as well as a detective (Hurt) who believes him to be a serial killer. Later he runs into a woman (Connelly) who claims to be his wife but he has no memory of her. (I'd remember her.) Sewell, in fact, has no memory of anything at all from his past.Out on the shabby city streets, surrounded by ominous and immensely tall buildings, Sewell is astounded. He can't tell what time period he's in because the cars are from the 40s and 50s. There are a few other people about but they all fall asleep at the same instant, no matter what they're doing at the time. It's always night. The sun never rises. And he runs through the alleys, hides in niches, clambers over roof tops, always pursued by either the cadaverous men in black clothes or by the relentless and humorless cop. Later, he'll see the buildings reshape themselves in a few minutes, the city changing its face.I don't know if I want to give away what's going on. It would be difficult in any case because the plot is so full of twists and turns and so many of the events inexplicable. I'll say it has something to do with aliens experimenting with human reactions to staged circumstances.It's all the product of a wild imagination -- Alex Proyas was the director and writer of the screenplay. I gather he'd opened the film with an explanation of what was up by Kiefer Sutherland, the mad scientist. It might have made for a less surprising but more comprehensible movie. As it is, all those dark scenes and paranoia depressed me. It was like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle, only the individual pieces were all drawn from different pictures and didn't fit together. Even at the end -- after the earth-shattering CGI confrontation, considerable doubt was left about what had just happened and what was going to happen.I kind of like stories about the mysterious transformation of people, events, and things, but I prefer them to be rooted in some kind of reality I can get hold of. Imagination is one thing; chaos is another. When literally anything can happen at any time, there is no longer room for surprise. Give me ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""Being John Malkovitch"". And I hope I never live to see another exploding head.",Dark City

Now Murdoch must find out a manner to stop them thanks his new telekinetic powers and before they take control of his wit and destroy him.This interesting Sci-Fi contains suspense ,thrills , chills and magnificent sets splendidly deigned by Patrick Tatopolous . Thought-provoking and suspenseful screenplay by the same director Alex Proyas though some complex and difficult with new twists and turns every few minutes . However , the picture suffers the comparison with classics as ¨Brazil or Blade Runner¨ . Thrilling and moving musical score by Trevor Jones . Dark and shading cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The motion picture is stunningly and originally directed by Alex Proyas . Alex is an expert on Science-Fiction as he has proved in ¨ The Raven¨, ¨I Robot¨ and ¨Knowing¨ .

12,blanche-2,Where the sun don't shine,9,13 June 2006,"""Dark City"" is a brilliant, imaginative sci-fi film starring Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland and William Hurt, who live in a nightmarish world, a city that is always dark.Alien beings, who resemble the Superbowl ""1984"" Apple commercial, have taken over the city and robbed its residents of their memories. They've then mixed the memories up and injected people with memories that aren't theirs, all by way of experiment in an attempt to discover the human soul, hoping somehow the important emotions will attach to these past experiences and people. One man (Sewall) fights off scientist Sutherland as he's about to give the injection, and now everyone is after him. The beings are able to pass a hand over the residents' faces when they want everyone to sleep, and during the sleep time, they rebuild the city to their own requirements.With shades of Fritz Lang's Metropolis, ""Dark City"" is a visually stunning film, from the sight of Jennifer Connelly in a brightly colored gown singing in a club, to skyscrapers creeping up to the sky, to the million stars populating the universe, to the huge clock showing midnight. You are drawn into this world and compelled to stay in it as Sewall tries to make some sense of who and what he is.Awesome, thoroughly captivating, thrilling - and for some reason underrated. Don't miss it.",Dark City
13,Quinoa1984,(director's cut review) This is what it's like to have a dream of cinema...,10,12 May 2016,"Dark City is one of those films that I remember only seeing bits and pieces of over the years; I'd be changing a channel and come upon Dark City and watch maybe a scene, a minute or two, and feel like I was being let in on some secret, or some disturbing dream that I had long ago that stayed in my subconscious. So over the years when I would think back to the film I'd remember these little snatches I'd caught on cable, like Keifer Sutherland explaining something about how memories and time works while going on a rowboat, or some ugly white dudes in big black costumes all in formation. Seeing the film in full finally, I think this was oddly enough an ideal approach: like many of the characters in the film, I have these, well, 'funny' feelings like something is adrift and out of place, that this snatch of a dream of Dark City is something that seems too good to be true as a film. As it turns out, this is one of the richest cinematic experiences from the 1990's.Like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, at least on the surface, it combines genres and does something unique, and in both cases the film language or grammar, the mood and feeling of film-noir (and film-noir may be more of a mood than a 'genre' of course, they stretch from being straight thrillers to psychological horror and even comedies and so on). But with Dark City instead of cartoon comedy we get science fiction. And I don't mean any run of the mill sci-fi, I'm talking sci-fi that's so hard that you can barely break it with a steel brick. The set up seems almost iniquitous as far as film noir tropes go: a man wakes up in a strange place (a hotel, always the best for seedy milieu) and can't remember anything, sees a dead body by the bed, and has to run from the cops and find his identity and what the hell has happened; his wife is a lounge-club singer (cut to lounge and sultry 40's style song); and there's a straight-shooting, curious but hard-liner detective on the case (Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connolly and William Hurt are these roles respectively, and ideally cast).When we start to sort of cross the line with sci-fi, though it could still be in film-noir, is with a peculiar doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland (maybe his greatest role, I dare say, certainly the one he gets to have... fun in an odd way) who goes around with a needs and pricks people's heads for... what? And what's with these white bald guys in the black cloaks and trenchcoats? What about that little kid? All of course, we can assume, will be revealed in good time, and from the opening minutes I knew I was in the hands of a confident storyteller, though there was also a part of me that though ""hmm, could Proyas and his writers be laying on the noir tropes a bit thick? Could this be like a Sin City where it's all style with only a modicum of substance?"" Not that the style is off at all, don't get me wrong, it's almost TOO good. And lo and behold, about 35/40 minutes into the movie, we learn why.That moment of discovering what's going on - without saying too much, not to spoil per-say just so you can get the excitement of discovery for yourself - somehow time stops all at once... all except for our hero, John Murdoch, who can't seem to understand why time has stopped. But it's at this moment that I fell in love with Dark City, and felt in sync with what it was going for and trying to do. It's a unique vision but it certainly is inspired by films of the past - Metropolis being one (remember the whole head/heart separation, which is part of the villains' master-plan, Blade Runner to an extent), and maybe even going into comic books there's a pulpy (but smart) sensibility that perhaps is why I also thought of Sin City. Why I fell in love with it is that the whole ""Style"" portion, and I keep using that word but it's for good reason, is due to the substance, it's inter-connected with it, can't have one without the other.And as we follow John on this trip of self-discovery it's really a wholly philosophical film, about finding what it means to be us and how it connects back into why we would want to watch ANY movie in the first place, to be connected to others and have that empathic connection. So while Proyas and his stellar production team have this world for us to see (one seemingly always at night but not without good reason!) and with this cast that knocks it out of the park, we get to see a little more and more behind the thematic curtains that come with tales drenched on dark city streets and in nightclubs and backrooms and with dames and cops and criminals... and also in the realm of beings from another dimension or something with their chamber of horrors.Some of the over-stylization may work better for some than others, and by the time it gets to the conclusion things become so wild that it verges into almost being comical (the cgi nears being dated but I'll take it). It's certainly not a movie to watch if you're not ready to engage with it, but it's really among only a handful of movies I can think of (Eraserhead being one) where I felt like I was seeing a motion picture experience that approximated a nightmare.",Dark City
14,BandSAboutMovies,Great!,6,18 April 2021,"The Matrix may be the movie that most go to when they think of 90's cyberpunk, but the truth is that Dark City came out a year before* and has many of the same storybeats. And Grant Morrison's 1994 comic The Invisibles had plenty of the elements that The Matrix also mined, like the leap of faith from a building and a gang of anarchists being the actual heroes against a world of sameness.It's pretty amazing that this movie ever came out, as who would think that New Line Cinema would co-finance a movie that's based on Plato's Allegory of the Cave? You can see their studio notes all over this movie, like how the psychic scenes needed effects and the voiceover introduction that attempts to explain everything to the audience.John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up not knowing who he is except that he's in a hotel bathtub. A call from Dr. Daniel Schreber (Keifer Sutherland) tells him to run, as there are a murdered body and a bloody knife in the next room, as well as a group of men called The Strangers after him.For some reason, no one realizes that the city is constantly covered in the dark of night. Murdoch discovers his name, that he has a wife named Emma (picture-perfect should-be giallo queen Jennifer Connelly) and that he also has powers that allow him to reshape reality.There's also William Hurt as a cop who believes that Murdoch is innocent of the murders and the fact that the Strangers are really aliens living inside the skins of dead humans and oh yeah - the city itself is floating in space inside a giant energy field.Dark City is packed with so many ideas that you could really watch it over and over and still find new ideas that were unseen in past viewings.Also, cheers to director and co-writer Alex Proyas for casting Richard O'Brien, bringing the Rocky Horror creator into yet another cultural obsession for me (along with Rocky, Flash Gordon, Shock Treatment, Jubilee and Spice World).Unlike the aforementioned Neo-starring film, Dark City went up against Titanic and faired about as well as you'd expect. Honestly, this is a movie that finds its audience and keeps it, reminding them that there is a secret world somewhere in which alien corpsewearers will learn that the human heart means more than the brain.As for me, I love movies shot completely inside on soundstages with cars and buildings that seem to come from no set time period. Therefore, if you're looking for a perfectly unexpected movie to pair this with, I'd suggest Streets of Fire.*It was also shot on the same sets at Fox Studios in Sydney.",Dark City
15,hitchcockthelegend,Welcome To Shell Beach.,9,2 July 2013,"Dark City D/CDark City is directed by Alex Proyas who also co-writes the screenplay with Leon Dobbs and David S. Goyer. It stars Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien and Ian Richardson. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Dariusz Wolski.A man wakes up in a grotty hotel bathroom and upon finding a dead girl in another room he realises he has no recollection of who he is or how he got there...There's a lot of Blade Runner fans still out there waiting for that film's sexual partner to happen along. What many of them don't realise is that Alex Proyas has already made that movie. More than a cult film yet still criminally ignored in certain circles, Dark City, by way of poor box office and studio interference, never got off to the best of starts. The problems were compounded with the release of The Matrix the following year, where that film's popularity, and its sci-fi linkage to Dark City, led many to think that Proyas' movie was a Matrix rip-off; pushing it further (unjustly) back in the sci-fi noir pantheon. Fact is is that Dark City homages much great cinema from previous years, but it has influenced much that followed, with Inception fans asked to note that Nolan himself was taking notes...Stolen Memories.Dark City is a feverish film noir dressed up in stunning sci-fi clothes. The amazing visuals have led many to state that it's a film with much style and little substance, something which Proyas has fiercely argued against; and he's right to do so, especially once his own preferred director's cut became available to view. The story is a complex one, pulsing with human characters living in a world where there is no daylight, with their respective memories scratchy to say the least, it quickly becomes evident that a creepy alien race are overseeing things. The aliens, wonderfully attired in black trench-coats and hats to match, and aided by Kiefer Sutherland's shifty - stammer affected - doctor, have special powers and their reasons for being here unfold in deftly constructed stages. One man stands in their way, John Murdoch (Sewell), but he is an olde noir amnesia sufferer supreme and his battle to unravel what is going on is our task as well.Do you think about the past much Mrs. Murdoch?The search for identity and the truth is what propels the picture forward. Murdoch in his confused state is not only at the center of an existential dilemma, he's also the focal point for a serial killer murder investigation. This also as he tries to come to terms with matters of the heart, it seems he has a beautiful wife (Connelly), and that she may have cheated on him? And why is he drawn to the place known as Shell Beach? A simple narrative hidden by visual splendours? Don't make me laugh! But hell you have to say the visual look and atmosphere of the design is very much attention grabbing.I have become the monster you were intended to be.With the film noir characters in place; Hurt's dour sleuth, Sewell's amnesiac and Connelly's sultry torch singer, Proyas brings German expressionism in abundance whilst overseeing an eye splintering neo-noir colour palette. Greens and reds often ping from the screen, while the murky browns and golds down on the angular city streets pave the way for changed perceptions and revelations of plotting. There are reoccurring motifs throughout, with swirls and circles integral to mood and meanings, while at the mid-point we then get to see Proyas' tricks of the trade, where the city shifts and moves to create a meeting of Metropolis and Gotham, all as the humans slumber away. Watch those clocks folks...You know how I was supposed to feel. That person isn't me... never was. You wanted to know what it was about us that made us human. Well, you're not going to find it...Acting performances are hardly top of the line (Sutherland especially irritates more than he impresses), but they actually don't need to be, and they all look terrific in their respective dressage. The story is of course bonkers and one which I myself found was much better whilst consuming mucho alcohol! (I watched it three times in 48 hours!) While Proyas himself is on record as saying it's a far from flawless picture. Again he is right, but he also knows that his film is still under valued and in need of more to seek out his director's cut. The late Roger Ebert championed Dark City with much gusto, and he provides very good input on the DVD, much like Roger I have to say, this is a unique and fabulous sci-fi noir experience. A film in fact fit to watch alongside Blade Runner; And I do not ever say that lightly. 9/10",Dark City
16,Hey_Sweden,A movie of both style and substance.,9,15 December 2012,"Director Alex Proyas, who'd previously directed the feature film version of ""The Crow"", brings a similar comic book style to this intriguing movie that injects a noir sensibility into an elaborate science fiction environment. Its visuals are very impressive, and at the same time that this movie is entertaining you it's making you think about certain aspects of human existence. Rufus Sewell is excellent as John Murdoch, an average Joe who wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of who he is; soon, mysterious entities named Strangers will be tailing him, as will the police, who believe him to be a murderer. The Strangers, it turns out, are fooling around with human memories, determined to get to the root of who and what we are as humans. They're fascinated by us, and keep this world in perpetual night. Production design, by George Liddle and Patrick Tatopoulos, is incredible, as is the cinematography by Dariusz Wolski. The pacing is very deliberate, but the story is compelling enough that one may not mind being guided through it carefully; there are action set pieces and special effects, but they're parcelled out a bit at a time. There is a certain grandeur to it all, as one can see from the lair of The Strangers, and the audience will also have a fun time absorbing the various plot twists that Proyas and fellow screenwriters Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer come up with. The twist with the reality behind mysterious location Shell Beach is particularly effective. The acting is solid from all concerned, with Jennifer Connelly as Murdochs' wife, William Hurt as the intrepid detective who's just as puzzled as the hero, Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson, and Bruce Spence as the very creepy principal Strangers, Colin Friels as harried ex-detective Walenski, Melissa George as the prostitute May, and Kiefer Sutherland in a very amusing, Peter Lorre-like turn as the stressed out doctor who knows a great deal about the reality of the situation facing everybody. In the end, this is provocative stuff that successfully deals with the issue of human identity; is it our memories that do indeed define who we are, or is there so much more to it than that? Many science fiction films over the years have dealt with the idea of what makes us human, and ""Dark City"" admirably keeps up that tradition. Worth a watch for discerning genre fans. Nine out of 10.",Dark City
17,preppy-3,Excellent sci-fi,10,15 November 2000,"I hate sci-fi, but I LOVE this movie. Well acted (especially by Sutherland and Sewell), astounding set design, moody direction and cinematography and a plot with numerous twists and turns. I'm not even going to try to explain the plot--it's way too involved. Also, this is an adult movie and demands your full attention--it would either disturb or bore children. It should be seen also for two performances--Jennifer Connolly who is drop-dead gorgeous and Rufus Sewell who is absolutely one of the most beautiful men I have ever seen--and those brown eyes of his! A must-see movie--even if you don't like sci-fi. Try to see it on DVD--this movie needs to be letter-boxed to fully appreciate it.",Dark City
18,LeonLouisRicci,Polarizing Picture...It's Up To You,8,4 December 2012,"There is much to look at and admire in this Sci-Fi Noir that takes place in a netherworld of mind control and Alien intervention. The overwhelming visuals vibrate at a frequency other than our own. This is a creepy and rich evocation of the evacuation of ourselves and our senses. The story thread of a serial killer is brought on and virtually ignored as things unfold in this Universe of upheaval. There is some confusing and rather vacant elements that can leave the viewer perplexed and frustrated, but one can be taken in by all the stunning staging and sophisticated scenery, and once there, it is a difficult return to normalcy.It is poorly acted for the most part and the characters are uninvolved to say the least. But it is the landscape of lunacy and nightmarish predicaments that pervade and if you are along for the ride the stiff actors and the elusive elements can be ignored and one can become swept up in its canvas of the surreal. The bizarre is the beat here and it is such a conglomerate of style over execution, it cannot be denied that this has an impact and can be regarded as one of those trips to the subconscious where only some things have a relevance and others are there in defiance of our cognition.This is one of those movies that is polarizing and not for all tastes. It can be quite an exhilarating experience or a monumental bore, pretentious, and ponderous. You decide.",Dark City
19,poolandrews,"A fine sci-fi, but maybe a little too clever & complex for it's own good.",7,7 March 2006,"Dark City tells the puzzling tale of John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), one fateful night he wakes up in unfamiliar surroundings, a bathtub in a sleazy motel room & has no memory of how he got there. John investigates the room & finds a dead prostitute on the floor (never a good thing in any situation!) & a suitcase in which a postcard of a place called 'Shell Beach' seems to have some significance to him but John can't remember why. John then receives a phone call from Dr. Daniel P. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) who says that people are coming to get him & he should leave straight away, advice which John wisely takes. The motel manager (Ritchie Singer) discovers the dead prostitute & the police are brought in, Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) is on the case & John his his number 1 suspect. Meanwhile John has an encounter with several alien controlled men dressed in black but he manages to escape. Eventually John meets Dr. Schreber face to face who informs John that an almost extinct race of aliens known as 'Strangers' put the entire city to sleep every night during which time they change people's memory's & the psychical layout of the city with a special power they have. Dr. Schreber goes on to explain to John that he also has this power & must use it in the fight against the Strangers in a bid to put an end to their sinister plans & liberate the dark city...This Australian American co-production was co-written, co-produced & directed by Alex Proyas & is a thoughtful sci-fi film that has an intriguing central idea if nothing else. The script by Proyas, David S. Goyer & Lem Dobbs is audacious in it's ambitions while the scale & scope of the story is a bit overwhelming at times. Dark City hooks you from the word go, although maybe the prologue reveals a little too much, & it certainly has it's fair share of twists, turns & the story takes various imaginative directions. However, I became a bit lost towards the end, it's not that I didn't know what was happening but I just felt too much was happening, the film wanted to do so much so quickly that I started to lose interest. I also didn't like the fact that it was so far removed from reality (in every possible way) that I had a hard time caring or relating to anyone or anything. As a whole Dark City is a unique piece of film-making, it shows intelligence, imagination & it mostly entertains although I also think that dark City is a film that you shouldn't think about too hard & just accept what's going on as I'm not sure it would hold up to close scrutiny.Director Proyas lets his imagination run wild & Dark City has absolutely stunning production design, the sets, the buildings, the clothes, the cars, the architecture & just about everything in Dark City looks fabulous, it has a really atmospheric Gothic crossed with art-deco crossed with film-noir look & feel to it. Dark City is one of those films which is a pleasure to watch & it seems as if every single shot had huge amounts of time & effort put into it.With a supposed budget of around $27,000,000 it appears as if almost every penny ended up on screen rather than some A-list star's pocket. Dark City looks sumptuous throughout & has that big budget Hollywood feel to it. Some of the CGI effects look a bit dated now but their still more than acceptable. Apparently Dark City has one of the shortest average shot lengths of any modern film at just 1.8 seconds, basically there is a cut around every 2 seconds, that's incredible isn't it? The acting is good by all, Richard O'Brien is the stand out who steals every scene he's in.Dark City is an engaging sci-fi film that tries to do something different & it succeeds. I must admit I have a few misgivings about it especially the way I was getting bored towards the end & I thought that maybe it was a bit too bizarre & 'out there' for my liking. Overall I'd still say that I think it's well worth a watch for those who want something a bit different.",Dark City
20,zardoz-13,"""Dark City"" Contains More Ka-Ka Than Kafka!",4,16 November 2008,"Austrian novelist Franz Kafka would probably applaud everything but the aliens and the ending in ""Crow"" director Alex Proyas' ""Dark City."" This gloomy but optimistic science-fiction murder-mystery features Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, and Kiefer Sutherland. Best when only gazed at, ""Dark City"" relies more on its hypnotic visuals than its shallow, predictable script.Comparatively, ""Dark City"" resembles Orson Welles' 1963 classic ""The Trial,"" based on the Kafka novel. An innocent man (Anthony Perkins) awakens one morning to find himself accused of an unknown crime that he didn't commit in what resembles a police state. Kafka serves merely as an aesthetic departure point for ""Dark City."" After establishing its metaphorical bond with Kafka, ""Dark City"" degenerates into a humdrum, happy-ending melodrama of the comic book variety.Despite its stunning technical virtuosity, ""Dark City"" frustrates anyone who scrutinizes its eye-popping style for a modicum of substance. Proyas' cinematic effort delivers few fresh ideas with its contrived, low-brow saga about humanity, individuality, and alien mind control. Worse, most of the ideas and imagery cobbled together in this predictable futuristic opus came from more entertaining movies. Suffice to say, ""Dark City"" contains more kaka than Kafka.""Dark City"" unravels as a pallid yarn about paranoia. Rufus Sewell of ""Dangerous Beauty"" impersonates a nondescript nobody who emerges as the savior of Proyas' brooding potboiler. Waking up in a dingy bathtub in a strange hotel, John Murdoch (Sewell) finds blood seeping from his forehead. Afflicted with amnesia, he stumbles onto the naked corpse of a murdered hooker. No sooner has Murdoch gathered his wits than he gets a sudden phone call from creepy Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland of ""Young Guns""). Murdoch learns that he is supposed to be a serial killer of prostitutes. Eluding an ominous gang of knife-wielding fiends, our hero embarks on a search for his identity.Murdoch confronts a grave new world where the sun never shines. Everything grinds to a spooky halt every night at midnight. A bizarre cabal of aliens is secretly experimenting with humans. They want to see how people react to a variety of different circumstances. They change the memories of these poor beggars as if their minds were Rubik's cubes. These cryptic characters are called 'Strangers.' This pale, cadaverous, mob dresses alike in long, black leather, Gestapo coats and dark hats to conceal their white cue ball heads. Not only does sunlight irritate them, but they also abhor moisture.We're told by the mad scientist narrator that the 'Strangers' are as old as time. They travel great distances by levitation. Endowed with the power to alter physical reality by a telepathic process called 'tuning,' these dour 'Strangers' can create doors in walls where no portals existed. Visually, their power is depicted as a slinky-like series of transparent concentric circles rippling out from the center of their foreheads. Oddly enough, these 'Strangers' are dying. All men and one boy, they are convinced that their survival lies in mankind. Before they can achieve their goal, these 'Strangers' must deduce what makes mankind 'human.' The 'Strangers' have abducted humans and taken them to a world they have created to figure out what makes mankind tick.""Dark City"" has a drab, monolithic plot with several inherent theatrical flaws.First, the filmmakers provide less than sensational heroics in the various skirmishes between the hero and the villains. ""Dark City"" fails to thrill because the leads are never in jeopardy. Moreover, when characters find themselves in danger, the challenge has a muted quality. The climactic 'tuning' battle between Mr. Book (Ian Richardson of ""Man of La Mancha"") and Murdoch lacks a credible quotient of violence. Second, too many characters clutter up the film! Inspector Frank Bumstead, a supporting character who is clearly more interesting than Murdoch, should have been the hero. Further, the movie makers should have combined Bumstead's role with the insane victim cop, Eddie Walenski (Colin Friels of ""Darkman""). Their synthesized characters would have made a more exciting hero. Third, we're never told how the hero acquired his ability to 'tune.' This is a pretty serious flaw because 'tuning' makes Murdock equal to his enemies. Worse, Dr. Schreber has no idea either, and he is the guy who concocted the stuff that he injects into the foreheads of the human with his baroque syringes. Fourth, ""Dark City"" suffers because the filmmakers refuse to tell us enough about these enigmatic 'Strangers.' They are a cryptic bunch that occupies space somewhere between Uncle Fester of ""The Adams Family"" and Clive Barker's Pin-Head.William Hurt of ""The Big Chill"" appears as a hard-boiled, accordion-playing detective determined to capture Murdoch. Wasted in a subordinate role, Hurt has little chance to develop anything more than a sketchy character. While it's always a pleasure to watch the eloquent Hurt, his cop character receives deplorable treatment. ""Dark City"" consigns sexy Jennifer Connelly to the cosmetic role of the woman-in-distress. Murdoch eventually gets around to saving her from the clutches of the Strangers near the end of the movie. Connelly and Sewell generate few sparks as lovers. She spends most of her screen time doing unremarkable things.Droopy-eyed Kiefer Sutherland chews the scenery as a stereotypical Dr. Moreau geneticist with everything but a Peter Lorre sneer. He sports quirky clothes, adopts an accent and shuffles rather than walks. As one of the movie's chief characters, Dr. Schreber strikes neither a villainous nor heroic posture. He mixes and matches genes in lab test tubes to draft new identities and memories. Proyas and his scenarists cannot figure out whether audiences should like or loathe him. Proyas generates an air of mystery, but this genre has been so overdone that ""Dark City"" illuminates nothing more than its own shortcomings. If Dungeons and Dragons entertain you, ""Dark City"" may mesmerize you.",Dark City

Yeah, yeah, yeah the visuals are stunning, blah, blah, blah, but as is proved time and again, visuals alone can't make a movie. At least this had an interesting story, but as befalls so many films in this mind-bending sci-fi genre (and ""The Matrix"" suffers from this as well, though it's a far better movie), the writers have set up such a cerebral concept that the movie grinds to a halt when it has to trudge through all the exposition just so that the audience can keep track of what's going on. Though that in itself is never very clear in ""Dark City."" This movie just rushes from one scene to the next, in an attempt to create a breathless and exciting tone I guess, but scenes aren't allowed to play themselves out. We're on to the next set piece before we've had time to absorb the one we just saw, and the characters get buried underneath all the furious editing. However, I don't believe there would be much chance for them anyway, since most of the actors aren't very good either. Rufus Sewell and William Hurt do o.k. but Jennifer Connelly phones in a wan performance and Kiefer Sutherland is barely watchable in a lamentable impersonation of the creepy Nazi chasing Indiana Jones in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" His line delivery is so eccentric and monotonous that I was cringing every time he opened his mouth by the film's end.No, I'm afraid the majority is out to sea with this one. This film and ""masterpiece"" don't belong in the same sentence.Grade: C-",Dark City

Title represents foundations of the mind as Kiefer Sutherland conducts an experiment to understand the human soul by impetrating a person's memory, which is injected into someone else and at midnight the city transforms. Rufuss Sewell awakens to discover that his wife cheated on him and he killed hookers. He searches for Shell Beach where his family died in a fire. Directed by Alex Proyas who previously applied his visual style to The Crow but this is a higher achievement. Rufus Sewell conveys the confusion of someone unaware of his present and past, and approaches his future with great uncertainty. Sutherland plays off the brains yet intimidated nature of the doctor who surrounds himself with water because the beings will not touch him. Jennifer Connelly plays Sewell's wife who helps him search for answers. William Hurt plays a cop on Sewell's trail but unable to explain the bizarre world around him. Richard O'Brien makes his latest appearance playing an ominous sinister character that he plays to a tee. The special effects are simply unique with invention at all corners of the screen.

There's a dead prostitute nearby that he gets blamed for murdering, but he can't remember much of anything. Several people seek him in the ensuing night hours: a somewhat mad doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland, a detective played by William Hurt, his estranged wife played by Jennifer Connelly, a hot woman of the night played by Melissa George and a bizarre group of pale bald males in black trench coats. The story follows Murdoch as he tries to piece together reality and escape the perpetually dark city.You have to be in the mood for a movie like this because it takes place entirely on elaborate shadowy sets with CGI backgrounds, etc. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up after 20 minutes. But, if you're in the right mode, this is a cool sci-fi flick with elements of horror/mystery and film noir. It never devolves into predictable blockbuster dreck and is thought-provoking. The revelation of the nature of the city is well done. In addition, Sewell makes for a top-rate protagonist and William Hurt is always likable. Many complain about Kiefer's offbeat performance, but the role called for it. If you don't like it blame the writers.On the female front you have Jennifer Connelly when she was still curvy and ravishing (by the early 2000s she lost too much weight and lost her sexiness). Melissa George is gorgeous in her small role as a bad girl.My interest in ""Dark City"" was spurred by Roger Ebert's exuberant accolades. He was so impressed by the illusion of the vast scope of the city, which can be attributed to the well-done CGI backgrounds and accouterments beyond the immediate exemplary sets. Of course, this is no big deal today, but at the time it was still fairly new technology.Some people compare ""Dark City"" to the more popular ""The Matrix"" and for good reason since they have similar themes and ""The Matrix"" was actually shot on some of the same sets, but it came out over a year later in 1999.The film runs 100 minutes and the Director's Cut 111 minutes; it was shot on sets in Sydney, Australia.GRADE: B+",Dark City

The lack of bright colors are obvious and create this dark ambiance. The least we can say is that Dark City is a weird movie with a lot of strange things happening. It's all well shot, there is no doubt about that, but I'm still not satisfied completely. The special effects are sometimes very basic, even for that time, and that could have been done much better. The story is so strange that it takes a while before you understand what is really going on. The acting is not bad though, especially from the main character played by Rufus Sewell.

30,bowmanblue,The Thinking Man's Matrix,9,2 March 2018,"It's hard to imagine the classic 1999 film 'The Matrix' starring Rufus Sewell in the lead, fighting an evil Agent played by a pasty bald Richard O'Brian. Yet, believe it or not, there is an 'early version' of the film that's just like that. 'Dark City' was released only one year earlier and it's basically the same premise, only it never achieved such greatness or Box Office success. But don't let that put you off.I love 'The Matrix.' It's very cool and you can't help but be wowed by the cyber-tech and, back then, the 'bullet-time' special effects were revolutionary for their day. Plus you had the highly-bankable Keanu Reeves in the lead and, no matter how wooden his performance, we all love to watch him. Therefore, 'The Matrix' just seemed to hit all the right notes at the right time (don't get me started on the sequels - that's a whole other story!). 'Dark City' didn't really have any of that. Rufus Sewell is a competent leading man, but you get the feeling that his part could have been played by any good looking guy, the same goes for his love interest Jennifer Connolly. It also doesn't have special effects that will make you think that you've never seen anything like that before. It's leads are competent, as are what effects the film utilises (nowadays I see a precursor to 'Inception' in there, too). It's dark (as the title suggests) and Gothic, portraying the film as a sombre and depressing affair, as opposed to 'The Matrix's' high-tech and uber-coolness. Therefore, 'Dark City' doesn't look or sound like anything that original. However, if you don't dwell on any of that (or just haven't seen 'The Matrix' - there must be a couple of you out there!) then this is really something pretty special.Yes, the film is quite (and I hate to keep using this word, but there really isn't any other that sums it up) 'dark.' It is certainly not a 'feel-good' film, but where it really succeeds is its sheer concept. Rufus Sewell wakes up in a flat with no memory of who he is. The only thing he knows is that there's a dead body in the apartment and it looks very much like he's the killer. Therefore, he sets out to find out who he is and whether he did it. Now, along the way he discovers that it's not just him who has a dark (there's that word again) past, but also his whole world. And that brings me nicely on to the baddies of the film - the 'Strangers.' Instead of 'The Matrix's' 'agents' you have a horde of black-trenchcoat-clad bald men with pasty faces hell-bent on thwarting our hero's efforts at every turn. And they really are great. Whether it's the fact that they refer to each other by weird noun-like names, i.e. 'Mr Hand' and 'Mr Foot,' or its' because they have one little boy-version of themselves who is just downright creepy (and don't get me started on their 'powers'). All in all, they're some of the best movie-villains ever created.If you like your sci-fi 'action-packed' and full of explosions and battles then you probably won't really enjoy this. I love it, but I don't watch it often - that's because you really need to be in the mood to sit down and watch quite a thoughtful film that really gets under your skin. There are some small fist-fights and superpowered skirmishes just in case you're wondering and I'm glad it seems that this film has found its own place in the world with a dedicated cult following. However, it will always be overshadowed by 'The Matrix,' but I believe that 'Dark City' is different and special enough to warrant its own place in your collection alongside Keanu trilogy.",Dark City
31,dromasca,"dark and original, but aging quickly",7,3 June 2005,"Alex Proyas made recently 'I, Robot' - a controversial version of Asimov's classic. I liked it and was in a minority. I believe that I may be in a minority again saying that 'Dark City' is an interesting film, with a lot of strong and original ideas, but also a fast aging piece of cinema.The theme of our civilization falling under the mind control of another civilization was repeatedly dealt with since 1998 when this film was made. Still the combination of detective story, mind control as in 'Eternal Sunshine', and alien contact, all filmed in a style reminding the 30 classic horror movies is interesting, but too heavy in my opinion to be efficient. The film tries to be too many things, a melding of too many styles, and falls eventually in a rather conventional ending, that cancels the surprises and tension built until then.Kiefer Sutherland's fans will enjoy seeing him in a very different role one second before '24'. Williana Hurt is as WIlliam Hurt as ever. The rest of the cast is good. What fail to make it to the screen are the graphics - the strong and original ideas of the movies are mis-represented using second quality graphics. If this was intended to be comics style, it's a bad idea because this movie tries to be more than comics.It's a film to remember, it's a different story than the usual science fiction stuff, unfortunately it's of the kind that fades rather than improves in time.",Dark City
32,ThomasDrufke,A City With No Sun,8,20 April 2017,"There's no doubting the imagination of Alex Proyas. Though most of Dark City is difficult to follow and is more style than substance, once the kick of the film finally happens, you realize how inventive and inspirational this film is to the science fiction genre. When push comes to shove, Dark City ranks among the weirdest and most unique sci-fi features to date.Knowing close to nothing going in was a wise choice, but I did find myself saying ""what in the world is going on?"" several times. The story follows a man named John Murdoch who finds himself alone in a bathtub with no memory of who he is or where he's been. Murdoch is being hunted by both law enforcement and a mysterious group of people, known as 'The Strangers' with unknown powers and abilities. In some ways, Dark City makes for a good compilation of films like The Matrix, Minority Report, Blade Runner, and even Metropolis. For much of the film Murdoch is the audience. We have no idea where we are, who's good, who's bad, and where this all ends up. But once Murdoch starts to understand 'The Strangers' agendas, the film starts to take off.The supporting cast includes William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, and Kiefer Sutherland. Similar to how I feel about the movie overall, I didn't really care for any of the characters in particular until you understand the context of how the film is being played out. Sutherland has the most to do, but his performance is diluted to a quick breathing nerdy doctor. I think as a whole Dark City will play better on repeated viewings. Especially because it will become more and more apparent just how many films have taken from Dark City. Proyas has made a few interesting directing choices since this one, but none quite capture the scope or uniqueness of Dark City. In the long-running genre of science fiction, Proyas' breakout film is definitely among the better ones.+Noir elements+Mystery plays out nicely+Gets better as it goes along-Could have opened up with more context8.7/10",Dark City
33,g-bodyl,Awesome Sci-Fi!,9,7 June 2014,"I can see all the comparisons this film get towards the Matrix, but Dark City came out first and it happens to be the better film. It's dark, brooding, and often philosophic. There are many weighty themes regarding the human mind and it basically asks the question, what is reality? The CGI, for it's time, was pretty good. The metropolis this film takes place in reminds me of Gotham City from 1989's Batman. The script is well-polished and for the most part, the acting is great.Alex Proyas directs a film about a guy named John Murdoch who awakens with fragmented memories with the only memories of his wife and a place named Shell Beach. He is chased by a detective who believes he is a murderer and by these beings known as The Strangers who have the ability to stop time and alternate reality.The acting is pretty good for the most part. Rufus Sewell is solid as John Murdoch and makes his character very believable. Jennifer Connelly is also pretty good as his wife. William Hurt is a great actor and it's no different in this movie. My only issue came with Kiefer Sutherland. It took me awhile to warm up to his character, but in the end I was able to come to terms with him.Overall, Dark City is a great sci-fi films that have many elements of film-noir. It's dark and brooding film and one can even go far out to call it unforgiving. I liked the visuals and I really liked the concepts of the movie. Even though it's not horror, this film can be scary at times. I rate this film 9/10.",Dark City
34,ericstevenson,"Uh, RIP Gene Siskel",9,2 August 2018,"I remember this movie as being Roger Ebert's favorite film of 1998, which was the last Top list that Gene Siskel joined him on. His favorite movie of 1998 was ""Babe: Pig In The City"", by the way. While I didn't like it as much as him, I still thought it was great. Many people have noticed similarities between this film and ""The Matrix"". I wouldn't go so far as to say this was ripped off by ""The Matrix"". That might just be because they used the same sets!If it was okay for them to do that, then it was okay for them to use this plot. I don't think it's as good as ""The Matrix"" because it seemed a little rushed. I wanted to see more of their world as something ordinary. It's still a fantastic looking film. We get great visuals from beginning to end and the Strangers are really awesome villains. I wanted to see outside of this world like I did in ""The Matrix"". ***1/2",Dark City
35,A_Different_Drummer,A Perfect 10 -- HARBINGER OF THE MATRIX - Here's a list...,10,26 March 2014,"One of the greatest sci-fi flix ever made, can be watched and re-watched. Reasons in no special order: 1. Alex Proyas is a genius but an inconsistent one. Here he is in full flight, at the top of his game. 2. Sutherland is one of those actors that people are divided about -- take for example 24, some loved it, some did not. Here he is pitch perfect. 3. Any movie with Connelly is always worth checking out (whatta face! See also my review of ONCE UPON A TIME IN America where she has an almost un-biilled role and steals every scene she is in). 4. A year ahead of the Matrix, this movie is practically its harbinger. While (arguably) the Matrix is the more devastating story, DARK CITY does boast the added attraction of not having two horrific sequels produced simply to milk the original franchise. Seriously, if you have not seen it, you owe it to yourself to check it out. The constant theme about getting to the ""beach"" is a metaphor for every hope and dream each one of us has had that never worked out. The idea of changing roles but staying on the same city-set is a metaphor for reincarnation. The ""tuning"" (like in the Matrix) retrieves the age-old question of whether man is meant to dominate the physical world, or be dominated by it. There's more, but that's plenty for this review.

36,inkblot11,Dark city will shine on in the annals of film history!,10,18 August 2006,"John Murdock (Rufus Sewell) wakes up one day in the bathtub with no memories of who or where he is. It seems that a group of people who dress in dark garb have been experimenting on human minds and, in John's case, something went terribly wrong. As he gradually pieces his life together, John must confront a horrible possibility. Is he a serial killer or merely the husband of beautiful Emma (Jennifer Connelly)? And, why is nearly everyone, from policemen, to doctors, to these mystery men (aliens?), trying to get rid of him? And, is there a reason it always night, with no daylight ever breaking through? This is, indeed, a monumental film in every way. The plot is a knockout, like a mirror that has been shattered and must be put back together again, piece by piece. And, the style! The art direction and cinematography is so amazing that mere words could never suffice. The dark clothed people are creepy and the earth they have altered is shadowy and sinister. The final battles between good and evil are, literally, out of this world. Sewell is perfect as the man who may or may not be a killer but is certainly determined to find out his identity. Sutherland, too, is especially wonderful as the doctor who may have sold his soul out to the dark side. Do not hesitate to watch this film in the near future.

The story is the star of this movie and add here a great movie making - ""Dark City"" blow my mind back in 1999 the first time i saw it. Now i revisited it just for the second time, and this time i watched it the director's cut. This is a visionary movie to begin with. The story itself was mind blowing back in the day when it was created - there was no ""Matrix"" and other similar movies back then, so you have to give a big kudos to creators to making this bold idea into a story and executing it at its best. Set design is astonishing, special effects serves the story, not other way around and script is great - it is not the most involving movie i've ever seen and you have to love sci-fi in general to truly appreciate this movie, but writer did a superb job in showing this world piece by piece.Overall, ""Dark City"" truly will stand out the test of time and will be considered as one of the best sci-fi movies around. It has great, brilliant idea and its execution is one of the kind. This is not a mainstream popcorn sci-fi - this one plays with ideas of such as ""what makes us human after all?"".

39,The-Sarkologist,A movie that explores the nature of memory and the soul,10,17 December 2011,"My friend suggested that I see this movie and said that it was very existentialist. I took his advise and am very glad that I did go and see it. I have added this movie to the must get movie list because of the story and the depth of it. Not only does this movie have an entertaining plot, but it explores a lot of things dealing with human existence, such as free will, memories, the soul, and even hope and happiness.The movie is about a race of beings who have a power called tuning, that is they can manipulate reality. They are a dying race so they go to Earth to study human kind to find the secret of immortality. They believe that by understanding the human soul and emotion they can save their race. Thus they gather humans together and program their memories so that they can study their responses. A problem arises when one of the subjects awakes before the process is finished and thus he wonders around without a mind. What makes it so dangerous is that this human, John Murdoch, can tune.There is an idea of hope running through the movie and this is created in a place known as Shell Beach. The city is dark and polluted and could represent the world while Shell Beach is everything that the city is not, and could represent heaven. No matter how John Murdoch tries to reach Shell Beach he cannot. He is always confronted with it, but there is no way that he can reach the place. In the end he discovers that it does not exist and thus creates it. It seems that one of the ideas is that beyond the hell that is this world there is nothing, true existentialist and absurdist philosophy. The only heaven is that which we create for ourselves. We can never reach heaven because Heaven does not exist and by seeking it we are only wasting our time.The question of who we really are is also raised. Are our memories really what we define ourselves as. We rely upon our memories to tell us who we are and this is what the aliens believe that makes us human. Yet the movie turns that back on ourselves telling us that our memories can be manipulated and changed, what is in our memories is only an illusion and our true self is in our soul. Unlike a lot of scientific notions, this movie claims the existence of the soul, yet it may not do that for it seems that the memories that are implanted into people force them to become what their memories tell them that they are. Are people nice people because of their memories or because of their soul? This is the question that the movie tries to answer. Is it possible to change our memories and thus create a different person or is the definition of our character different. I seem to fall on the side of our memories are the definition of our character. Not always though because there are parts of us that are separate from our memories that still define who we are. Still a person that is constantly attacked by society is more likely to come out as a social critic than is one who has a pleasant life.Freedom is another idea that comes in through the movie. It is the typical American idea of individual freedom and the removal of a more powerful controlling force that impedes that freedom. I was criticised for reading too much into the movie concerning this, but the aliens, which could and probably do, represent the government, control the lives of the people who live in the dark city. They change the people as they like and will move them from the street into a beautiful mansion to test their theories. To the aliens we are just toys and this is a backlash at an impersonal government that treats the people as such.I have probably revealed a lot about this movie, but its depth calls for it to be examined in such a way. To just talk about the movie without revealing much would have caused a lot of problems because many of the themes that come out of the movie are revealed the deeper one dives into it. In anycase, this is a brilliant movie. Another thing is that not one second is wasted in this movie. The plot is exceptional and keeps you hooked right through to the end. Things are always happening and being revealed, though there are breathers at spots to allow one to catch up with what has been shown.",Dark City

In addition to this, I have to say that the direction made by Alex Proyas who is also the writer was exceptional and made me feel the agony of our main character on his quest of finding the truth. The interpretation of Rufus Sewell who played as John Murdoch is simply amazing and I believe that it's the best interpretation of him.

The fatal error of the movie is to cast Sewell as the lead actor as it's a newcomer without presence! This way, I never get into this movie and it was like I was helpless against this dark world!

43,howard.schumann,A visually striking and atmospheric science fiction thriller,10,29 March 2009,"Delving into areas to be explored later in The Matrix and The Truman Show, Alex Proyas' 1998 film Dark City examines whether what we call reality is in fact an objective physical presence existing in time and space or simply a simulacrum devised by our own minds or the minds of others. Like The Matrix, Dark City succeeds as both a visually striking and atmospheric science fiction thriller and an inquiry into the subjective nature of memory. Far from being cold or soulless as some critics have claimed, we identify with the characters and their desire to restore truth and beauty to a world grown dark and dead. Though initially unsuccessful, it has been championed by Roger Ebert and others as a cult classic and has been recently released on a Director's Cut DVD that adds eleven minutes to the theatrical release and eliminates the opening narration.While The Matrix posed the question, how do we know what is real and what is a dream? Dark City asks  are we more than just the sum of our experiences? Is the ""I"" that we know simply the sum of our memories or something vastly different? In both films, one character tries to hold onto something tangibly real while the world around him shapes and shifts. Both films agree that if our reality is a simulation, like lucid dreamers who learn to exert control on the illusory world of their dreams, we have untapped abilities to manipulate the illusion but must be trained to recognize and perfect our powers.Co-written by Proyas and David S. Goyer, John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub in a seedy hotel room in a city bathed in perpetual darkness, but has no conscious memory of who he is and how he got there. The only thing he learns is that he is a suspect in a string of murders of prostitutes and is being pursued by the police, particularly Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) and is being given advice by a strange doctor, Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) who talks in short, choppy sentences, as if he just ran the New York Marathon. Also hot on his tail are mysterious ""strangers"" who look like the trench coat mafia and have the ability to rearrange the memories in people's lives as easily as remodeling one's apartment, placing the entire city in ""sleep mode"" every midnight while they manipulate people's lives and the look and feel of the city.One sequence is particular in which a working class couple awakes to a lavish dining room complete with chandeliers and a long dining table as if nothing has happened is quite extraordinary. Discovering that he is the only person unaffected by the aliens' powers and actually shares some of their ""tuning"" abilities, Murdoch sets out to reconstruct vague memories of his wife Anna (Jennifer Connolly), a night club singer who comes to his support and a place called Shell Beach where he is alleged to have grown up as a boy. As he tries to make sense of his situation, Murdoch discovers that the aliens efforts to transplant people's memories is an attempt to discover the ""soul"" that makes human beings tick and incorporate it into their dying world.Dark City updates the film noir tradition, creating a sepia-toned city of 1940s style architecture with dim-lit cafés, retro movie theaters, and a world of dark alleys, a quiet city where in the words of Samuel Beckett's Molloy, ""nothing stirs, has never stirred, will never stir..."" Murdoch, like Molloy, must discover if there is any ""possible end to these wastes where the light never was, nor any upright thing, nor any true foundation, but only these leaning things, forever lapsing and crumbling away, beneath a sky without memory of morning or hope of night."" Only when he learns the true nature of reality and his ability to control it can he undertake a battle for the city and for his dream that Shell Beach can become more than a picture postcard.Note: The director's cut menu offers three expanded commentary tracksby Proyas, by Dobbs and Goyer, and by Ebert. In each instance, elements of their original commentaries are merged with new material. There is also a text-based fact track that highlights the differences between the two cuts of the film, though it also offers some random anecdotes about the movie. Three featurettes""Introduction by Alex Proyas,"" ""Memories of Shell Beach,"" and ""Architecture of Dreams""form a lengthy and informative making-of documentary when you select the ""Play All"" option.

47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Vividly imagined by Proyas, ""Dark City"" is an instant science-fiction classic",10,31 December 2008,"One thing that science-fiction junkies often consider is what aliens would think of us if they studied our planet. Alex Proyas' mystery thriller ""Dark City"" tells a tale of how they might experiment with us if they discovered our planet and what they would learn about what makes humans tick. In essence, that's what Proyas' script aims to do, discover just a little piece of what it means to be human, and that's what all great films accomplish.The Strangers are the aliens in the film who have the power of ""tuning"" which essentially means willing the physical environment around them with their minds and the help of their giant underground machines. They use this power of creation in combination with artificially manufacturing memories (with the aid of a scientist played by Kiefer Sutherland) to create scenarios in which to study their human subjects. So when John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up one night with no memory to find he's wanted for murder, he begins to uncover the truth as he searches for answers to his own past.""Dark City"" begins as more of a mystery thriller. There are unsolved murders, John is searching for his memories and he's being hunted by a detective (William Hurt). Couple that with Proyas' vision for this experimental city environment, modeled in a 1930s or 40s style but with a dark and decrepit feel to it and you have sort of a science-fiction noir film. It's really a beautifully imagined world even though it's very old-fashioned and downtrodden. As the film progresses and you learn more about what the Strangers are up to and what they're capable of (key in on Sutherland's character for the explanations), then ""Dark City"" emerges as the sci-fi thriller it was born to be. Visual effects abound (that are quite impressive for 1998), action around most corners and explanations of the bizarre aren't more than a scene away.Directorially, Proyas makes more a visual statement early on in the more noir/mystery portion of the film. There some really great shots -- copious amounts of them in this film in general -- all of which are helped out by intriguing lighting and set design. Between this and the script, you can tell just how vivid Proyas' imagination has to be to actually bring this film to life.For fans of science-fiction, this film is an easy favorite. All of the film's shortcomings, whether you find the acting just sort of at par or the dialogue not all that stimulating for the actors to work with, the mythology of this film is so elaborate and spectacular that it gives your brain plenty to chew on. The film is not shy about its probing into the relationship between human memory and emotion and is exceptionally poignant in tackling such an abstract concept.~Steven C Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Dark City
48,funkyfry,One of the best sci-fi movies I've seen,9,13 December 2007,"What I'd personally like to focus on is the theme of the fluidity of identity, a strong theme explored in many great works of fantasy and fiction in general, film noir in particular (e.g. ""The Scar"", ""Tension,"" ""Gilda""). Here we have a brilliant twist on the old amnesia story  our hero John Murdock's (Rufus Sewell) memories weren't lost because of some trauma or neurosis/psychosis, but rather he never had those memories because he actually avoided a trauma and a neurosis tailor-made for him by alien interlopers called The Strangers. In the course of the film the characters piece together reality from the bits left behind every night by the Strangers. The crux of the story is the same as the object of the Strangers' experiment  the nature of the human soul, specifically free will, the role that experiences or conditioning play in our decision making process. If you give a regular man the memories of a serial killer, will he continue to act as a killer or to what extent will his ""nature"" assert itself? The Strangers do realize that man is more than the sum of his experiences, but they need to know what exactly causes that difference. It really gets interesting when one of the Strangers, Mr. Hand, injects himself with the memories that were supposed to be John Murdock's, and actually becomes the killer. Taking up Mr. Ebert's suggestion that Mr. Hand represents the Jungian dark self or shadow of the hero (a fairly obvious conclusion), the film seems to be making a refreshingly optimistic statement about the importance of the conscious rational mind over and above the irrational unconscious.This film seems at first overly stylized and derivative, but after the secret is revealed we realize why this is so  heck you could even argue that the Strangers watched ""Metropolis,"" ""Naked City"" etc. and formed their ideas about human society through them though such a conceit is hardly necessary: the Strangers are drawing from various epochs in human history and perhaps they are deliberately trying to give the humans an atmosphere both recognizable and alien. After all, if you were seeking the mystery of the soul it would hardly do to simply look at one period of time or one particular culture. It's also clear the director is using the image of the circles not just as a metaphor for the story and the process of self-discovery that forms the core of the drama, but also as a way of explaining how and why the city was built. The city might resemble aspects of both the ""real"" and ""romantic"" 1940s  1960s city simply as a result of the natural process of adding up and combining all the pieces of memory and impression used as building blocks in its creation. Form mirrors content upon accumulation of details, in other words.I also really agree with Ebert's point that the reason some of these performances might seem shallow is because here we have actors who are working with characters that don't have any real memories. As such, method acting would actually be inappropriate. I like the idea that they are forming their real personalities based on the experiences they've actually had in real life, which is to say the events we've seen in the film itself. I had an interesting event that happened to me the other day that sheds some light on this, for me anyway. I went into my favorite burrito place here in Oakland, a place I visit almost every week. I walked through the restaurant and went up to the counter to order my food, and then someone slapped me on the back. I turn and see one of my best friends in the world standing there laughing. And it occurred to me later  how could I possibly not see my best friend sitting there at the table? It's because we're in ""city-mode"" when we're moving about the city doing things  very focused on what we're doing and adopting a sort of glazed indifference to the chaos around us as a defense mechanism. And thinking about this movie, it seems to me that what we're seeing is really an exaggerated version of the normal reality of city life such as what I experienced the other day. Consider how the other characters in the story don't even think about the fact that they don't have any specific memories and can't tell anyone how to get to Shell Beach. They are just more or less doing what they need to do, running through the maze the Strangers have set up for them. Go into the automat, push the button, get what you need. Sadly this is very recognizable I'm sure to most people today, particularly those of us who live in the city. This film is reminding us to stay awake and constantly question authority and reality. It is also reminding us of how much of life and reality we miss every day simply by getting so focused on our own immediate needs and fears. These characters in this story pass each other in the night  they really do touch each other, even through the fog of cynicism and predatory sex and violence that lie at the heart of Dark City and film noir itself. And to whatever extent the film is successful, they touch us as well. I don't think the film was trying to make a metaphysical/philosophical argument, but simply to remind us (as did some of the best episodes of ""Twilight Zone"" and the film ""Blade Runner"") that there's more to being human than simply satisfying our needs and wants, even though living in the city sometimes it feels like that's all anyone is capable of.",Dark City

The story, which revolves around perceptions and memory, is excellent, as is the dark, 'goth' look of the film (at times somewhat reminiscent of ""Hellraiser""). The acting is generally good (and fun, with a couple of the ""Strangers"" played by Rocky Horror creator Richard O'Brian and ""The Road Warrior""s 'gyro-captain' Bruce Spence), although a pre-""24"" Kiefer Sutherland is a bit over-the-top as the shambling, hoarse Dr. Schreber. The effects are excellent by late '90's standards and effective by any standard. All in all, a great dark-fantasy film that seems less well-known than is deserved. Try to avoid the unnecessary opening voice-over (apparently absent on the director's cut), it gives away too much of the plot.",Dark City
52,freemantle_uk,"Compelling, fast paced neo-noir sci-fi",9,6 August 2011,"Before I start this review is of the original cut of the film.Sci-fi films of the 70s and the classic Blade Runner were able to mix science fiction and a mystery/detective plot. Blade Runner is particular famous for having film noir as an influence and Dark City certainly wanted to capture its magic.Set in a 1930s like city John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bath tube with no memories and a dead prostitute in a apartment. Then he gets a call from Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) who tells him he needs to run before a blue skinned alien race capture him. Soon John discovers he has a wife, singer Emma (Jennifer Connelly), being chased by the police let by Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) and more importantly discovers he has psychic powers called 'tune' and that the city's skyline changes because the aliens have the ability to alter reality. John has to solve the mysteries of the aliens and his own past, knowing something is not right with this city.Blade Runner was clearly an influence on Dark City in both storytelling and visual style and the film's look and certain story elements were similar to the classic silent film Metropolis. Dark City also shares themes of control and what is reality with The Matrix and The Truman Show, films that were made at the same time. Dark City had a very clever script behind, great for another who likes a bit of intellect in their movies.Director Alex Proyas has a great eye for cityscape, as seen in his other films The Crow and I, Robot. I really enjoyed the use of models to show how the city changes and gives it more physicality. Because of the short running Proyas has to make his film a very fast paced adventure, but he was able to balance out the mystery, ideas, characters and the action effective. There is dark edge to this film as people's identities are changed and taken away, people not knowing who they really are as well as some trying sinister characters. There is a very retro feel to the film, from the art-deco, 1930s looking city, the characters dressed like 30s noir characters and using luger pistols and many of the setting like the club and the restaurant. Topping it all of is Dr. Schreber's mad scientist outfit which looked very much like something from a 1950s B-Movie or a cartoon series.Anyway a worthy watch for someone who likes a bit of intelligence in their sci-fi.",Dark City
53,strong-122-478885,Phew! My Brain Just Wouldn't Stop Farting!,3,11 May 2013,"For me, the grim and grimy bleakness of Dark City's story was delivered in such a chaotic muddle that it gave me the worst case of brain farts ever experienced from watching any movie since seeing the likes of the ultra-boring Blade Runner. And, after only a short while, just the mere mention of Shell Beach seriously began to grate on my nerves like you wouldn't believe.Dark City certainly didn't even come anywhere near to living up to its potential or its apparent reputation as being a perfect example of a brilliant Sci-Fi/Fantasy story dealing intelligently with such subject matter as ""humans-as-guinea-pigs"". This film was just silly, comic-book shenanigans that left the viewer less than satisfied with its inevitable outcome. It was very much like being shipwrecked on the shores of Shell Beach.This story's major downfall was that ""The Strangers"" kept the city with no-name in a state of continual darkness. If they had even the least bit of understanding about humans, they would've realized that we essentially need sunlight for our very survival. (The humans in this story seem to have not realized this, as well) Living in perpetual darkness would mean only severe sickness and surely a quick death for the human race. We, literally, cannot continue to live without relying on the sun as our #1 source of energy.Two things that I found really puzzling about ""The Strangers"" was that there was only one child amongst the whole lot and that there were absolutely no women, at all. I don't know if this was some sort of an oversight by the screenwriters, or what, but I found it only added even more damaging weight to the overall weakness of Dark City's already seriously floundering story.Of the 4 principal actors who starred in Dark City (Kiefer Sutherland, William Hurt, Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly), I thought that each and every one of their performances to be unacceptably poor and downright mundane.It was the annoying, pig-faced Sutherland, in particular, who was so atrociously despicable as Dr. Schreber that I immediately began to dread every single scene that he happened to appear in. It was he, alone, who brought this movie down a couple of significant notches.Well, about all that I have left to say is - Thank goodness that my brain farts were odorless, otherwise, if they hadn't been, I would have ended up stinking everyone else watching Dark City with me right out of the room.",Dark City

55,drqshadow-reviews,"High-Tempo, Genre-Spanning Gloom with an Arresting Visual Identity",8,9 July 2020,"Alex Proyas, director of 1994's similarly moody action gloomer The Crow, brings us this bleak vision of stifling, gothic noir in a bottled city that's never seen the sun. Super stylish and visually ambitious, it's a film with a boatload of high-concept revelations and almost no sense of chill. Even the editing refuses to take breaks, with jump cuts and extreme close-ups roughly every second-and-a-half for the entire duration. That gives the whole picture a feel of frantic energy, which suits the amnesiac protagonist in his confused quest for answers, but can be exhausting for the viewer. Sometimes we just need a few beats to let the message sink in.Then again, when you've got as much thematic ammunition as Proyas does in Dark City, maybe such intellectual force-feedings are preferable to a four-hour running time. It's a motion picture that often transcends the value of its components, succeeding in spite of its missteps and shortcomings. Many key elements take the form of guilty pleasures, far better in practice than they have any right to be, from the Nosferatu-esque pale, thin men in long black coats to the wacky, Akira-influenced psychokinetic duels near the end. That carries over to the not-quite-polished special effects, too, which occasionally show their seams and stitches but, somehow, feel more honest and appreciable for it.There's a lot to soak in here, maybe too much for one movie, but I admire the effort and thoroughly enjoyed the end product. Would-be viewers should be ready to think and pay attention, lest they find themselves washed away by the raging torrent of ideas.",Dark City

Imagine if what you thought was reality constantly changed under your feet. This unusual tale is told in Terry Gilliam style with imaginative sets, characters and a compelling story that slowly reveals itself. The rough story is some otherworldly beings pause time to rearrange the physical city as pieced together from everyone's lives and memories in order to learn about humanity. Thus causing everyone to have faulty memories and confused and altered relationships. Occasionally, a few people become immune to the pausing of time. Will these people be able to end the endless shifting rubrics cube of life? What is intriguing about the style of this film that is while it appears to be a 40s Noir, the architecture and style are a tapestry of other styles and eras due to the rearranging of memories; the current reality is a visual mixture from different periods of people's lives.

And then, after 90 minutes of dull neo-noir mystery, it turned on a dime with a tonally incongruous smack-down finale that did little to re-ignite my interest.There's some nifty stuff in there, and I can see its influence on more recent—and much better—work, but I just can't see what all the hubbub is about with 'Dark City'.",Dark City

The story revolves around a man who awakes in the bathtub of a dirty hotel room. He doesn't remember who he is and how he got there. To make matters worse, there is the dead body of a female in the hotel room. The man has to find out his identity in order to prove his innocence and reveal the real culprits behind the gruesome crime in a city where the sun never shines.This film convinces on many levels. First of all, the visual effects are absolutely astonishing. The entire movie takes place in a dark city that gives the film a gloomy atmosphere. The scarce use of light sources in advertisements, buildings and vehicles works very efficiently.Up next, the acting performances are truly convincing. Rufus Sewell delivers the goods as resilient outsider looking for the truth. William Hurt impresses as curious inspector. Kiefer Sutherland shines as nervous doctor with a hidden agenda. Jennifer Connelly convinces as innocent woman caught up in a web of lies.The story is also truly intriguing. The movie starts on a mysterious note and gets only more intriguing with each and every scene. The film offers a few intelligent surprises and twists that will keep the audience watching until the very end.To keep it short, Dark City is a cult movie and among the very best dystopian science-fiction films ever released. It convinces with its memorable visual effects, excellent acting performances and intriguing plot. This movie even outshines similar films that were shot later on such as The Matrix.

61,davispittman,Unconventional sci fi film,8,12 September 2017,"Dark City is definitely a one of a kind movie. There's no other in the science fiction genre that's similar to it. It stands alone. Most of the time I really enjoy films that are unique and stand out, and this one fits into that most category. Typically I'm not huge on the science fiction genre, but I think even if you don't usually care for that type of film, you'll still like this one. One of the reasons it can transcend a strict science fiction audience is because of its intelligence. The film doesn't reveal a whole lot until the very end, which is very clever, keeps the viewer guessing the whole way through. The cast is very good. I think each and every cast member was picked well and represents their role well. The plot is a lot to explain, and the movie gets more complicated as it goes along, so I'll just say that the plot is full of rich twists and turns. I can almost 100% guarantee that you will not be bored with this film, too much is going on for that to happen. The special effects were good for 1998, they are kind of dated by today's standards, but they still work, the buildings in the city are probably the most interesting thing as far as visual effects go.

Anyway this film is a slow burner and I liked it, the mystery of why's why is slowly revealed, it was satisfying because it went from no answers and lots of questions to everything explained, but not all at a time, but everything with time.

The writer, co-scripter and director, Proyas has given his film a real boost by adding strong dramatic tension and a menacing thriller element. He blends all the ingredients well, and provides the perfect mood for the feature.George Liddle's production design is superlative, well captured as it is by the camera of Dariusz Wolski. Music is from Trevor Jones.Rufus Sewell does very well as the bewildered Murdoch, a man who has no idea who he is or what is going on in this ""Dark City"". Kiefer Sutherland is a treat (perhaps his best role) as the psychiatrist who appears to hold the key to Murdoch's past and the secrets of the city. William Hurt sadly gets too little to do as the fastidious Inspector Bumstead, while Colin Friels plays the borderline psychotic ""Frank"" with glee. Also starts Jennifer Connelly as Murdoch's forgotten wife, and Aussie stars Melissa George and Bruce Spence. Great to see!The only thing Mr. Proyas does not prepare us for is his rather over the top finale (perhaps a little overkill there), and his all too neat denouement. The conclusion only slightly taints what is otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable production.Friday, October 30, 1998 - Astor Theatre StKilda",Dark City
66,dworldeater,Reality may not be what it seems,9,15 April 2020,"Dark City is a very underrated science fiction masterpiece that has a devoted cult fan base, but ultimately did not get the respect it deserves. A year later a blockbuster movie would be released and that film is The Matrix and that movie rips off Dark City left and right and is in my opinion half as good as this. Dark City is a cerebral and visual feast that is both visually and intellectually stimulating. This is a very noirish looking thriller that has lots of twists and turns that bends reality. Dark City is a grim existential thriller in a horrific science fiction world. It has a lot of style and substance and is a very well done and original sci fi flick. While Dark City might be beyond the comprehension of some viewers, it's worth watching and rewatching to pick up on details you may have missed the 1st time around. Great cinema in my opinion.

67,Jonny_Numb,Untied laces,6,12 July 2007,"Though some may consider it the ""be-all, end-all"" sci-fi flick, ""Dark City""--while an interesting existential meditation on creation--is a remarkably cold piece of work. Granted, it's a beautifully-conceived piece of work, brimming with intelligence and intrigue (probably the reason it bombed at the box office), but its philosophy is unsupported by its characters who, no matter how integral to the plot, remain paper-thin ciphers from start to finish (making the main character an amnesiac shouldn't have exempted the screenwriters from throwing a few emotions into the role). This is unfortunate, since ""Dark City"" is a fine film on its own, with some good eye candy and interesting ideas: an alien race known as ""The Strangers"" has created a world (with a heavy 1940s Noir look) wherein they tinker with the identities of the inhabitants in an attempt to discover what, exactly, makes human beings such a unique breed; they are also able to alter material reality through sheer will. Richard O'Brien (Riff Raff!) stands out as a key Stranger, but the humans are not quite earthbound--with the exception of Colin Friels (another amnesiac), who brings some much-needed, high-strung energy to the proceedings for a few minutes, bigger names like Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly, and William Hurt are left stranded in the mechanical script, while Kiefer Sutherland invokes Quasimodo. As a mainstream entertainment, ""Dark City"" does what is expected while clarifying as much as possible for the average film-goer--however, I wound up wishing the emotional and intellectual aspects had been pushed further.",Dark City

69,gazzo-2,"Pretty good forerunner to the Matrix, by and large......",7,9 July 2005,".....few things that I remember about it when it came out-Roger Ebert called it the Best film of 1998(over Pvt Ryan etc? Naw....), it came and went quickly, and no one seems to remember it much now.I liked it for the most part. Performances are good, sets great, F/X unique, storyline ranging from 'Metropolis' to 'the Matrix' from the year after this came out. I was bothered only by a few things--the Freddy Kruegerish appearance of the baddies was not original, to say the least; you never find out where they got these people from who play the lab rats--how much of Earth is left over, what year is it, etc--forget that. Not gonna get the answers.Acting is solid-Sutherland plays a different kinda role but I thought was good. Connelly was her usual voluptuous, soft-spoken 1990's self, before she became a stick. Go back to eating more please Jen. The lead I don't remember from anything else, but he was fine, and certainly an improvement over Keanu. William Hurt does his usual.This was an impressive movie to watch, but I am not surprised it failed at the box office. It's downbeat, slow, murky, and moody. No one is a big name. And you don't get the kinds of payoffs in it that audiences seem to want (paging Keanu again...).....That said, do watch it. It's worth getting.

71,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Too complex for its own good but still thought provoking,7,16 January 2015,"Director Alex Proyas is not what you would consider to be a mainstream or cash-grab filmmaker. Although he hasn't produced several outputs, his productions have more than not have had great feedback and has taken years to make. Unlike The Crow (1994) which was more heavily inspired by a comic book, this film starts Proyas' film career as the director who will include the themes of individualism and human life for next couple of entries. This would follow through in I, Robot (2004) and Knowing (2009). However, this particular entry in that field is probably the most surreal and bizarre. When a man named John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up after not remembering a thing about himself or what he was doing, he makes it his life mission to figure it out. This decision of course is only made after he receives a strange phone call from Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) warning him of the danger he is in.The screenplay was written by a combination of Proyas, Lem Dobbs and famed to be comic book writer, David S. Goyer. Together they produce a written work that will surely have the hooks to grasp its audience and have them pay attention. The basis of individualism and uniqueness is the story's strongest point. The fact that being human is one of the most important qualities in life is essential to our biological existence. Nobody is exactly the same and if we were, what would make anyone of us special or different from the others? Unfortunately, with this very thought provoking underlining topic come unexplained errors and loopholes. These of which cannot be elaborated on in much detail due to how critical it is to the viewing experience. To put it briefly, there are certain things that don't seem logically possible to accomplish physically. Thus producing big questions for how the plot unfolds.The characters in this movie are memorable in some ways but not all. Rufus Sewell as the protagonist is convincing as a wanderer and grows later on with proper development. Yet, his presence isn't exactly the most ground shaking of performances. Also for anyone who has OCD, it may annoy them that occasionally Sewell will suffer from a lazy eye. Jennifer Connelly who plays Murdoch's wife also gives a believable performance for her attempts to try and jog her husband's memory. Along with her, she also teams up with Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) who look to understand what is going on around them. Additionally co- starring these actors is Richard O'Brien, Bruce Spence and Colin Friels, all of which have key roles in the story being told. Still, the most interesting character is Dr. Schreber played by Sutherland. The knowledge that he carries and the rhythm at which he speaks is rare compared to the rest of the cast.The finalizing attributes to the film are also well done. The cinematography administered by Dariusz Wolski (who also worked on The Crow (1994)) looks good. For a set that looks awfully similar in several locations, Wolski manages to show different angles and not make it the same view every time. Plus when it switches over to special effects, the integration is mostly unnoticeable. And because this is Alex Proyas directing, the visual style will be heavy handed and it's very creative. For music, composer Trevor Jones took the helm. Although more of an organic composer when it comes to instruments, Jones seems to operate the orchestra with synths with ease. The synths are played to represent memories which kind of sound like ""scrapping"" notes. For the villains, their theme is much more traditional with horns and percussion. The best however belongs to Emma (Connelly's character). It is very soft and sounds tragic too with background guitars and a leading flute. It's the most memorable piece.Its plot holes are its biggest issue, which is located in its spoiler filled screenplay. To understand them, it has to be seen. Other than Rufus Sewell not having the most commanding of performances, the acting is serviceable, with appropriate music, decent special effects and a fascinating underlining theme of humanity.",Dark City

The whole movie is cold, dark and it never lights up for a minute. This movie is an underrated brilliant sci-fi film and it bares a resemblance to 'The Matrix', but was made before it, so there is no denying that Dark City must have been an inspiration for The Matrix.The story is complex but develops itself as a frequently entertaining thriller.

Rufus Sewell plays the confused lead, William Hurt plays the film noir detective and Kiefer Sutherland is the quirky side switching doctor. Don't forget Jennifer Connellywho plays the role with great expertise. Alex Proyas much like The Crow has created this Gothic world where the sun never rises and inhabitants live in darkness. The sets and costumes are beautiful. The acting is top-of-the-line, with Sewell in the lead part. Everyone does a great job.The villains in this film, THE STRANGERS, are creepy and will send chills down your spine every time you see them in their long black coats and hat. The costumes for them are perfect and could not have been done better, they live in the world underground and you see the different lifestyles between them and the people they control, yet live above them.The thing that amazed me the most would be the cross between the 1950 to 1980's, it was brilliant, the set pieces were perfect for this film.

The initially Kafkaesque nightmare of John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) groggily awakening in an unfamiliar body, with a wife he doesn't recognize in a constantly mutable shadow city very soon escalates to pure, unleavened existential terror, as he becomes ceaselessly hunted by pallid-looking, Noirish Cenobite-like alien enforcers, and in his desperate attempt to elude capture, the increasingly discombobulated John discovers that he might be the bizarre messianic catalyst in a morbidly-majestic metaphysical conspiracy that is quite literally out of this world!

75,Screen_Blitz,"Thoroughly mind-bending and visually arresting, Dark City is a thrillingly fresh science-fiction tale that really works",9,13 July 2017,"Set in a bleak dystopian world, Dark City, directed by Alex Poryas of 'The Crow', is a mind-bending science-fiction vehicle that aims to challenge audiences at a psychological level while pushing the boundaries of cerebral ideas. It is a film aiming to grip moviegoers with an arresting visual style while capitalizing on a chock full of concepts that feel fresh. Tautly paced and piercing with a complex narrative, Dark City never holds back when splashing viewers with cutting-edge of surprises and unpredictable twists. The central figure of this compelling tale is an amnesiac man fighting for the truth in a world where nothing is what he appears and reality is distorted to alarming proportions. And it is the mind-bending plot that is the driving force of this twisted tale. Alex Poryas handles the story immense precision without resorting to overly familiar elements. It is more than safe to say that his effort prevail. In deeper words, his efforts amount to something that feels groundbreaking. This film is set in a world where the sun never rises and the cities are blanketed with everlasting nightfall. John Murdoch (played by Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of his past or Emma (played by Jennifer Connolly), a woman who claims to be his wife. When Murdoch is alerted by Dr. Daniel Schreiber (played by Kiefer Sutherland) of Detective Frank Bumstead (played by William Hurt) who is hunting down for a series of grisly murders he has no memory of committing. Murdoch must evade Bumstead and uncover the truth of his past while running evading a league of alien-like humans known as The Strangers who each have dubious tricks under their sleeves.Is this guy a murderer? Is he innocent? Is there a corrupt side of the law enforcement officer? Each questions lies in the heat battle between the lead character and the enigmatic truth that hidden by an enemy beyond his imagination. Director Alex Poryas drives the story with a plot where the some of the most shocking surprises are not what we know but what we don't know. One thing that Poryas accomplishes here is keeping things unpredictable from beginning to end. In the process, the film holds no barrs when challenging viewers' expectations and placing the characters in a ramshackle of shocking twists and grim conspiracies. While Poryas leaves room for a few action set pieces, he keeps it suppressed for the most of the second half before delivering a visually stunning climatic battle during the final twenty minutes. As for the visual department, Poryas proves himself highly a dazzling production design of a dystopian society plunged into darkness, owing elements to Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' with a slice of 'Blade Runner'. Rufus Sewell's John Murdoch makes for an appealing protagonist, the character that manages to stand out considerably among the supporting cast of underdeveloped characters. Although Sewell's performance occasionally fluctuates between strong and clunky, he mostly gets the job done. Jennifer Connolly plays Emma with great humility and fortitude, and his romance with John is fine, but never quite sizzles. William Hurt embraces his character with humanity without straying into the portrayal of over-the-topness. But he is certainly not a villain that hits a home-run. Kiefer Sutherland gets his time to shine, but the lack of depth in this character limit his ability to fully blossom his talent in the role. It appears that John Murdoch is the only firmly developed character in the pack which makes him unsurprisingly easy to root for. Dark City is a thoroughly mind-bending science-fiction trek, shining with chord-striking visual compulsion and a story that is enormously engaging, if slightly flawed in its roots. The movie will more than likely not appeal to individuals alienated by a dark atmosphere, hence the title, or intellectually challenging narrative. But for others, it is a chord-striking experience and a sucker punch achievement in its genre.",Dark City
76,frankde-jong,"A lot of fiction, little science but very beautiful images.",8,26 April 2021,"""Dark city"" is a lot of fiction and little science. There are a lot of themes combined in one film.The theme of implanting artificial memories (see also ""Total recall"" (1990, Paul Verhoeven)).The theme of aliens with a collective memory (see also ""Village of the damned"" (1960, Wolf Rilla)).The theme of the individuality of human beings threatened by aliens (see also ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel)).The theme of a city as a set piece (see also ""The Truman show"" (1998, Peter Weir)).So much themes in one film leads to a somewhat fragmented plot. It is the images that save the film. Images that are indebted to the fiilm noir genre, which is not illogical because just like ""Dark city"" film noirs do love (literally) the ""dark site of town"". Also other SF movies of the dystopia kind (portraying an undesirable society in the future) often show a resemblance with film noir iconography (for example ""Blade runner"" (1982, Ridley Scott)).All in all Dark city is in no way less spectacular then Christopher Nolans Gotham city.",Dark City
77,oneguyrambling,A vinyl outfit and some wire-work away from being The Matrix cousin we never knew.,8,27 January 2012,"Dark City was lost amid all the Matrix fawning that occurred in the 90s, which is a shame, because although it might not be quite as good or quite as memorable, Dark City is a masterful display of style and a solid film in its own right.Perhaps they should've put the actors in tight vinyl outfits? Dark City seems to take place in an alternate version of the 1950s, the guys wear dark suits and hats and the gals dress up real nice – even when they're hookers or lounge singers.John Murdoch (Rupert Sewell) wakes up from an undetermined period of sleep/unconsciousness on a bathroom floor to find that he is linked to both of the afore-mentioned types of females. One is his wife, lounge singer Emma (Jennifer Connelly), the other a dead hooker on the floor of the room with strange shapes carved into her flesh There are apparently 6 dead hookers so far, and Detective Bumstead (William Hurt) is all over the case. Bumstead is thorough but appears a little nervous, possibly because the man previously in charge of the case – and his former friend – has been declared insane and spends his days ranting and raving about things that sound nonsensical.Meanwhile Murdoch spends some time trying to recall his past and to find any detail that might be a clue to his true identity or his potential culpability. He even visits another hooker (Melissa George) to see if he is struck by any strange 'urges'.Keifer Sutherland appears claiming to be his private doctor, though Murdoch cannot recall ever meeting him, and things only get more confusing when cloaked, black hat wearing pasty guys show up demanding Murdoch go with them before hovering in mid air. It must be said that the first meeting with 'the Strangers' finds that for super beings (or whatever they are) they are quite ineffectual. For all their matter-transforming powers they can't even manage to take down one man on his own on a ledge.The plot of Dark City is not simple enough to summarise without giving too much away, so let's just say that Murdoch spends the remainder of the film finding the answers to the who/what/where/when and why and dealing with the realities that the answers force upon him.Dark City is reminiscent of many films yet very different to all of them. I was reminded of The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and yes there was more than a hint of The Matrix in there too.Having to exist in a city of seemingly perpetual darkness results in the characters appearing worn and weary, and for long periods so too does the film, it unravels slowly then abruptly turns in on itself and moves in another direction altogether, and just when you feel you have the answer it moves once more.Being made in Australia no doubt helped it stay low budget but did apparently necessitate the inclusion of several bit actors – who might actually be talented – but can't pull off a convincing American accent. Keifer Sutherland seemed very miscast to me and was perhaps there for name recognition. His jittery, eternally out of breath Dr Schreber ended up giving me the willie's with a performance that took the Tom Waits asylum inmate from Dracula and just turned it into a whiny annoying pathetic creature. Maybe that was the intent, but it didn't help my enjoyment of the film.Dark City has some exceptionally vivid images and a plot that rewards attention all the way to the end – though it is let down just a little by a cheesy ending. The few shortfalls that it has don't prevent it from being worth a look, but they do hold it back from true greatness.Final Rating – 8 / 10. In a pinch I would choose The Matrix over Dark City, but in reality both films are worth your time.",Dark City
78,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,9,29 July 2009,"Dark City is a film that will only grow with time, for not only is it a bottleneck work of art, but it's a transcendent film. Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it transcends the limits of sci fi. Similarly, claims that the film is Gothic, noir, Expressionist, etc. are similarly shortsighted, as well are those which liken the film's narrative to Kafka or Orwell. The clear progenitor of this film is in fact Rod Serling, creator of the television show The Twilight Zone. But the film makes use of imagery from sources few have ever noticed- from campy predecessors in science fiction- the scene of Murdoch on The Strangers' wheel is highly derivative of the flying death scenes in Logan's Run, and the early scenes of The Strangers causing the city to sleep for a tuning, with cars in the middle of traffic jammed roads, is a steal straight from the opening scenes of Federico Fellini's 8½. This diversity, however, just proves a point I've long made, that greatness is a difference of kind not merely degree. Great films, and works of art, like Dark City, transcend their natal genres, and join a higher club, for they have more in common with the great films of other genres, than they do with lesser examples of their genre. And, the bottleneck status of Dark City also proves another point. German filmmaker Werner Herzog has long declared that our culture (cinematic or not) is currently starved for images, especially new images for a new age. I've never bought that, and a film like Dark City disproves Herzog's point. Images are always recycled, as are stories, and until mankind gets into outer space and experiences new things, now images are going to be relatively scarce. What I believe Herzog meant, however, was that the old images, stories, and ideas, need to be made re-new, and this is the essence of an artistic bottleneck- be it artwork or artist. The old is all filtered through that bottleneck and re-presented in new ways, mixed with new things, and, most of all, made better. As example, Shakespeare improved upon the dramatic archetypes of Greek tragedies, and the Modern Masters (Ibsen, Shaw, O'Neill) improved on Shakespeare's often one dimensional characters and fleshed them out, and set them in 'real' situations, rather than the soap operatic melodramas Shakespeare could rarely transcend. It is quality, and quality alone, that is the important thing in any work of art, because that is a thing that is not ground to the subjective biases of individuals nor masses, not originality nor sentiment. And in these areas that define what makes a work of art work greatly, Alex Proyas's film Dark City transcends to that rarest circle, greatness, even as, within the limits of its genre it stands alone.nonpareil.",Dark City
79,mstomaso,We are Rats in a Maze Without an Exit,9,3 February 2008,"The opening voice-over narrative by Kiefer Sutherland is worrisome. Within a few seconds of the beginning of Dark City we learn that the film' s Men-in-black have abducted a city's worth of humans (given the noir-esquire landscape and the 1940s and 1950s cars we have assume this happened in the mid-20th century) in order to perform experiments and learn what allows the human species to continue to thrive. The film is more about spirituality than evolution and more fantasy than sci-fi. But do not let the apparent spoiler in the preface or the lack of plausibility bother you. After the opening scene, you will be hooked.Rufus Sewell and Kiefer Sutherland star, supported by William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly - an impressive cast for a work of imaginative fiction. And they are all put to really good use. Sewell is a man who inexplicably has virtually no memory and is the prime suspect in a serial murder case. His estranged wife (Connelly) and two police detectives (Hurt and Colin Friels) are all looking for him, and he is looking for a truth which may or may not exist. Transcending all of this is the work of The Strangers and their apparent human puppet, psych-pharmacist Kiefer Sutherland - who put everybody (except Sewell) to sleep at noon everyday in order to rearrange the city, people's memories, and more.The cast is very good. Sewell and Sutherland's roles were very demanding and both actors interpret them interestingly and well. Connelly and Hurt provide exceptionally good support. Hurt looks like he was born for film noir.What this film ends up being about (no spoiler - you will have to see it to even interpret this comment) is what we choose to do and why. And the answers for Sewell's John Murdoch and Sutherland's Dr. Shreber may surprise you. The script is one of the best of the genre - well thought-out, intelligent and providing solid opportunities for character development.The film is very nicely and artistically designed and shot. the city's landscape is surreal-noir as are the costumes. The alien technology and costuming is dark, imposing and Gothic. The look and feel of the film, oddly, is that of a dark and creepy fairy tale, not the sci-fi adventure that the story develops into. This treatment is particularly affective, because it gives the somewhat predictable action scenes both a meaningful context and a somewhat less climactic feeling than usual.",Dark City
80,vithiet,Loved it when it came out but hasn't aged well at all,6,1 January 2019,I loved this movie so much when it came out. It hasn't aged that well though and so I had to knock 2 stars off my original rating after watching it recently. Still worth watching for any sci-fi fan.,Dark City
81,hall895,Finding our humanity,7,30 July 2013,"Dark City begins with an opening voice-over narration which basically gives the whole plot away. Fans of the film hated this and in a later cut of the film the narration was removed. It does seem logical that a movie which has so many mysterious elements shouldn't reveal all its secrets in the first thirty seconds. But in this case the narration probably served the film well. Because what is going on in this film is very weird, exceedingly bizarre and not particularly easy to comprehend unless you have some solid base of initial knowledge to fall back on. And there are still enough twists, turns and impactful surprises to make the film very compelling. Giving the audience a little help at the beginning paid off. Otherwise by the time the film finally fully revealed itself many people may have been too lost, too confused, too frustrated to appreciate what they had seen. And there is so much to appreciate.It also must be said that having the story laid out in such detail early on allows the audience to accept that story much easier. It is a story which requires tremendous leaps of faith. Without sufficient grounding the story may ultimately have proved to be just too strange for many people to take. Even with so many of its secrets given away right at the start the story still manages to grab you. A man wakes up in a bathtub. He can't seem to remember anything. His forehead is bleeding. There's a dead woman on the floor. And then the phone rings, someone tells him he needs to run away now because they are coming to get him. Who are ""they""? Who knows? Anyway, the man flees and the movie kicks into high gear very quickly. The man is John Murdoch. Or is he? It becomes clear very quickly that nothing in this city is exactly what it seems. John Murdoch is not the only person here with vanished memories. He doesn't really know who he is. Nobody does. But nobody besides John realizes anything is amiss. It is up to him to unravel the mystery. What he discovers will shock both him and us. The film packs quite a dramatic punch and raises serious questions about humanity. What makes us human? This film's mysterious Strangers need to know the answer to that question.It is the Strangers who drive the plot. They can manipulate the physical environment of the city, creating new buildings and changing the form of existing ones in mere moments with just the power of their minds. And yet none of the humans ever notice anything has changed. And it is not just the buildings the Strangers change, they have a rather insidious, invasive way of changing the people themselves. Then the Strangers sit back and see what happens. The humans, unknowingly, are their lab rats. John however is resistant to the efforts of the Strangers. Not only that he apparently shares their powers. With the help of a police detective he sets out to find the truth and to give the citizens of the city back their humanity, give them back a sense of who they really are.Rufus Sewell does very well with the challenging role of John Murdoch, a man who does not know who he is. Sewell captures the original bewilderment well and then grows with the character as John finds the strength and determination to put an end to whatever is going on here. William Hurt plays the detective who ends up assisting John, Jennifer Connelly plays John's wife. They both end up very confused and Hurt and Connelly give very good performances as their characters try to figure out what the heck is going on here. Richard O'Brien is appropriately creepy playing the film's most prominent Stranger. Perhaps the only misstep comes from Kiefer Sutherland playing a doctor mixed up in the activities of the Strangers. Sutherland plays the role with a stammer which becomes distracting and annoying very quickly. It's a little bit of weirdness the film didn't need, it adds nothing to the character and the film's plenty weird enough already. But that quibble aside the film generally works very well. It is a fascinating, intriguing, thought-provoking story. Visually the film looks spectacular with wonderful set design and brilliantly executed effects. Perhaps the film goes a little overboard with the effects near the end. The story gets somewhat left behind as things wrap up with a big visual effects blowout. You can't help but think this very smart film deserved a little bit smarter of an ending. But the film ultimately is more than satisfying enough. It entertains you and it also makes you think which is always a good combination. Dark City's story is a very complex web to weave your way through, having had a little guidance at the start surely couldn't have hurt. And when you get to the end you'll look back and be grateful for the long, strange, fascinating trip the film took you on.",Dark City
82,sharky_55,The night never ends here.,7,2 August 2016,"The world of Dark City is frighteningly realised. It starts, in usual noir fashion, with a man abruptly waking up in a strange, dingy room with a stranger phonecall heeding a warning. He has no memory of his past or identity, but is asked to be the protagonist and be on the run almost immediately. Slowly the pieces are drawn together. The film's title is quite literal. The rain-streaked streets are practically allergic to lights, except for a few briefly flickering neon lights, feebly trying to stave off the darkness. Interiors have a sickly, alien green tinge that seems to emanate from no visible source, and the walls close in claustrophobically on John Murdoch (the plot becomes one of those typical mysteries where we start with a phrase or name and slowly unravel the puzzle). And its inhabitants speak strangely, for the few that are not content to namelessly shuffle on by. The barman, or rather the hotel man, bellows profusely but others no information. He says things like ""cash on the barrelhead"". What time period are we in? We do not know, and neither does John Murdoch. The best of the science fiction films draw us in immediately, and this is what Dark City does. It pieces together familiar elements from other stories and genres, but leaves a darker trail for us to follow, one which creates unease and disillusionment at every shadowy corner. Many of us will recognise the femme fatale type with her sultry voice, serenading what is left of the nightly crowd. Connelly's eyes have a piercing beauty, although the rest of her body seems stiff, and her hips do not swing in the same way we expect them to. Is this a limitation of her performance, or simply a byproduct of living in Dark City? Murdoch does not have time to find out. He is being chased by men shrouded in dark, with pale, ivory skin and gleaming daggers. They seem only humanoid in appearance. In one of the film's most sinister moments, everyone but Murdoch falls asleep at midnight, and the buildings and walls themselves begin to shift and morph into different shapes. The effects are done with extreme care; the city becomes a massive, hulking superstructure with a mind of its own, brainwashing and altering story lines and identities, the very concrete facts that Murdoch has painlessly uncovered. It recalls the very essence of German Expressionism, and how the city is like a physical representation of Murdoch's own psyche, as twisted and unsettling as regime he has stumbled upon. The intent is very Orwellian, and like a Winston Smith, he can do nothing but watch it happen. The story is strongly reminiscent of The Matrix, which was released a year later. Both feature a special and unique individual who has the bandages over his eyes ripped off to face an eerie dystopia and an impossible task. The latter is cleverer; it made a dystopia out of an apparent utopia, fear out of perfection and clean surfaces. And the action is slicker, more precise, more orientated - it helps when you have superpowers and can call in a small army of guns. The impact of Dark City is more visceral, more immediate. It is almost certain that what lies behind the brick wall is not the sun-kissed Shell Beach, and we can feel the collective despair of the emptiness of the dark blotches of space. There's an allegorical message in there somewhere if you dig deep enough, but it's muddled within the plot. So it has to finish with spectacle, but at least it is large-scale and of the best kind.",Dark City
83,CharltonBoy,A Batmanesque film in Gothic city!,6,8 February 2000,"This film had an interesting concept about it and the special affects are fairly good to but for me it was far too dark and depressing. The director is the same person who made the Crow and i think he used the same set! The story is about a group of alien beings who , at midnight every night , send the population of this city/planet asleep in order to experiment on their minds in order to be more human. But something goes wrong as someone fails to go to sleep and starts to uncover what is going on. As a said a promising plot but all in all a bit of a let down. 6 out of 10",Dark City
84,KnightsofNi11,A flawed but great sci-fi adventure,7,4 January 2011,"Alex Proyas' sophomore film is a fun one. It is sort of one of those films that you just have to take it for what it is, but if you do so then you can have a lot of fun with it. It's the story of a man who wakes up with no memory of who he is, but is wanted for a series of gruesome murders. As he attempts to piece together his past he discovers his city is being run by strange horrific beings called The Strangers and they are hunting him down for some reason. The film starts out as a wonderfully perplexing mystery, and eventually turns into an overall fun science fiction experience.There are some ingenious concepts behind the story and exposition of this film. As I watched I kept thinking about The Matrix, and of course to my surprise this film came out a year before The Matrix. But it borrows from a lot of the big brother concepts we've seen in sci-fi's in the past. But thankfully the concept of this story stays overall original and enticing. It might not have the depth that other films like it have, but it does justice to these exciting sci-fi elements and creates a still original story. My only problem with all this, however, is how everything is explained. I'm not a fan of having everything explained to me via one character's monologue, and that is exactly how Dark City pans out. After a lot of mysterious exposition I found myself enthralled into trying to figure out just what was going on here. I was anticipating the big ""a-ha"" moment, but then Kiefer Sutherland's character appears and explains everything outright, turning the ""a-ha"" moment into a ""ok now I get it"" moment, which is pretty anti-climactic if you ask me.The movie also falls a little short on characterization, but not enough to frustrate me. Rufus Sewell as the main character, John Murdoch, does a decent job. His range isn't tremendous but he delivers a performance decent enough to drive the story well. His character could have used some more depth but I still enjoyed what I was given. Jennifer Connelly, who I'm madly in love with, plays Sewell's wife and she does a good job in her limited, yet important, role. I wasn't a fan of Kiefer Sutherland and was put off by his performance. His character arguably could have been one of the most intricate and best of the film, but his performance is lackluster and the character isn't brought out to his full potential. William Hurt is the highlight role of the film as Inspector Frank Bumstead. He is a great character with a lot more depth than the rest. And Hurt's performance is great.Characters aren't exactly the main focus of Dark City though. The real focus is towards the storyline and especially the overall design of the film. The city in which the film takes place is brilliantly and hauntingly designed. It is an aptly named city, as there is no sun there and it is always dark and gloomy. The film gives off a constant future-noir vibe much like that of Blade Runner, my favorite science fiction film of all time. The eerie interior and exterior designs of all the buildings in the film give it a great feel that the film never loses. There is also the underground world where The Strangers live that leans much more to the science-fiction side of the future-noir spectrum, and is something really odd and fascinating to look at. This film's artistic design is definitely its highlight and it gives Dark City all of its unique flare.Dark City is no doubt a good science fiction film. The design of the film is genius and it sets it apart from a lot of films that try to capture this kind of look but fail at it. I really just wish that the film could have matched its visual elements with great storyline elements. The exposition is fantastic, but I was very disappointed when everything was explained so simply and so unoriginally to me. And from there the film lost a lot of its mystery aspect and morphed into simply just an action packed science fiction adventure. Maybe I asked too much of this film, but regardless I came out of this movie with mixed feelings. I would have liked more, but I still really enjoyed Dark City and would at least consider watching it again.",Dark City
85,rps-2,Sorry... I'm not that artsy dartsy,3,13 February 2007,"I've always claimed nobody ever made a science fiction movie that was good (yes, including 2001.) And I like and read a lot of sci fi.I'm glad my premise remains unchallenged. This is yet another well done stinker. The movie has an intriguing premise, a Kafka like and gloomy false world where reality is all in our minds. The whole thing takes place in a sort of Gotham City on steroids. Mind you, the effects are superbly done. But it just doesn't come together. Much the same experience can be had by eating pickles with ice cream before going to bed. You wait for Batman and Robin to swoop in. Alas, they never do. It would provide a moment of comic relief to the unending Gothic dreariness. I'm still not sure why Keefer Sutherland speaks his lines as though reading them from a teleprompter with a broken gear. And as much as I admire the magisterial Ian Richardson, he is miscast here as the head bad guy. Not my cup of tea. But then, maybe in an alternate reality I would like it. Several times in the film Richardson says in that plummy, commanding voice of his ""Shut it down."" He's talking about the pseudo universe. Too bad the production crews didn't think he meant the movie.",Dark City
86,khanbaliq2,"An extremely ambitious film about the nature of the human soul, Dark City is worth seeing simply for its visual artistry.",8,2 May 2010,"Dark City is a film that should get more recognition. After watching it several times I am convinced that it's one of the best films of the 1990s and one of the best science fiction films ever. It flows well from scene to scene. The cinematography is gorgeous. One of the Strangers mentions that the city was created from different eras of human history. In this bustling metropolis exist vintage cars, monorails, tall old style buildings, and the people wear 1930 fashion. All this contributes to a city that is fascinating to look at. The story is also interesting. It revolves around what makes people human. Is it just our memories or is there more to it? Many human conditions are represented in the film.The characters fit in well with the story. William Hurt plays inspector Frank Bumstead, a man who's lonely and obsessed with little details. Almost all characters are played by famous actors. Jennifer Connelly plays John Murdoch's beautiful brunette wife, and there's also a woman (Melissa George), who takes a liking to Murdoch, who's a pretty blonde. What's important is that these people aren't there just for show. They all play important roles, and they're all different and well-rounded characters. There's a lot to like about the film. The score is fitting, and there are two good vocals songs; Sway and The Night Has A Thousand Eyes. Every scene is well thought-out and filmed. What I liked most about Dark City though is that it's a science fiction film noir. It's a great film too. It's more coherent than Blade Runner (1982). Dark City influenced The Matrix (1999). Both were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney using some of the same sets. Comparisons have been made between scenes from the films, making note of similarities in both cinematography and atmosphere, as well as the plot. But Dark City is a better film. I give it my highest recommendation.",Dark City
87,The_Movie_Cat,"""None of us remember that... what we once were... what we might have been.""",7,9 September 1999,"24 May 2014:Dark City was one of the first films I ever reviewed on the IMDb, awarding it 4/10 and slating it under the summary title ""Hellraiser meets the Maltese Falcon for an MTV generation"".Rewatching it, I'm not sure what my issues really were, other than perhaps being slightly underwhelmed. After all, the plot - creatures alter your mind and your world while you're asleep - perhaps sounds more original and sinister on paper.Yet while it perhaps doesn't live up to its full potential, and has some issues with exposition and the odd corny line, it's still a very good film. One of my main criticisms was that the influences it has can all too clearly be felt, and, while this is still perhaps true, it has enough of its own identity to be worthwhile.It's possible that the extended director's cut aids enjoyment (ironically another criticism I had back in '99 was ""ultimately the film's only saving grace is its brevity."") and keeps some of the mystery later.If there is one criticism is that there's a layer of Burtonesque artifice throughout, and you're never in any doubt that you're watching something shot entirely on sets. This is partly the point, of course, but I can't help but feel it could have had more effect if it had been shot with a little more realism to accentuate the oddities of the script. Also unfortunate is the very mainstream Hollywood orchestral soundtrack, whereas something weirder may have helped.But overall, this is a decent film, well worth a second chance.",Dark City
88,itamarscomix,Stylish,7,14 January 2012,"Dark City feels almost like a Matrix rip-off, but in fact it was released a year earlier. It's something of a diamond in the rough - a fantastic story, lots of good ideas and good writing, great art direction and a dark, strong atmosphere. Unfortunately, Proyas's directorial work isn't as strong as the story, and it doesn't do it justice; the action and chase scenes, as a whole, feel unbalanced and poorly paced. And much of the cast is out of place too, especially Kiefer Sutherland who does a very poor job in a role which should have been a key one to the story. It's good hard sci-fi, but it's flawed, and that may explain why it's not remembered as a classic. But for fans of the genre, it's highly recommended.",Dark City

It's a pity the main character is not better embodied and the set up gives an overall impression of B-movie (like good Twilight Zone episodes). I think it mainly comes from the picturesque people living under. They seem to come straight out of some Comic and they bear quite ridiculous names (Mr. Hand, Mr. Quick, Mr. Memory - sorry that one was in The 39 steps).What did the Wachowski brothers do better?Implication: The Matrix designs our entire world, not just unlucky people who can no longer have their own memories.Identification: The hero has to be chased before we ever learn why he is the hero. Then he is given an illustrated explanation of why his gift is so important. Eventually he is taught to use his power. He is John Doe and he is told he's the best.Frightful villains: A villain with a top hat is ridiculous. A villain you would hardly notice in the street brings more fear to the screen once given a particularity. Special sunglasses and black suits are simple props - but they're quite a commonplace now.Adding action: ...and innovate. What could be a spectacular transcription of the hero's power ? How to shoot various confrontations with the villains without using the same opposition ?No flat ending: the hero does not get back to rags.

90,DarthVoorhees,A Sci-Fi Masterpiece on the level of Star Wars,10,11 September 2007,"There are great films and then there are masterpieces. Dark City falls in the later category. The Sci-Fi genre hasn't much to it's name, Metropolis, Star Wars,Empire Strikes Back and 2001 are the only true stand outs that come to mind. Dark City is brilliant on the level of those films.Alex Proyas creates a world that is largely his own but still owes a lot to Fritz Lang's Metropolis. The set direction for Dark City is absolutely amazing. Every shot is beautiful to look at. It's a sin that the film didn't get an Oscar for art direction.Proyas respects the art of film-making and tries to put as much as he can into each shot of the movie. I've heard he would go second after second in every moment in the film and this story is very easy to believe.The heart of Dark City and why it is so great is it's story. It's a brilliant Orwellian thriller about a group of alien creatures called the Strangers who try to find the human soul and extract it to prolong their extinction. They inject new memories into the residents of their city every night hoping to find something deeper in us. Rufus Sewell stars as John Murdoch, a man who resists his new memory. The Strangers have placed him in quite the predicament, he wakes in a hotel room with a dead prostitute near his bedside. A scientist named Schrebber puts John on the path to discover what is behind this world. Through the search for answers John discovers that he is gaining the Strangers power. Like the Strangers John also needs to discover what love and emotions are before the journey's end.The Matrix comparisons are unavoidable. To the people who say Matrix is better I say to you, What movie did you watch? Dark City is much much much more intelligent, more attractive visually and has a better cast than Matrix. Murdoch is a much more potent hero than Neo the comic book cut out. Dark City deals with real emotions and theological themes where Matrix is a good action film at best.The cast is terrific as well. Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien and William Hurt all give the best performances of their career here. Sewell is an unexpected delight as Murdoch. He is able to relay great emotion and makes the character complex and interesting.

91,0w0,"A good sci-fi movie, but it has an unrealistic Neo-based plot...",7,5 August 2020,"The entire story is quite unique and I haven't ever watched a movie with a similar plot, so the movie should be commended for that, however there are several plot-holes, the biggest of which is the fact that none of the 'bad guys' ever use their psychic powers to attack the 'good guy'. I mean... the movie follows this 'Neo' character, yet the 'bad guys' never even really try to harm him, and that is the biggest plot-hole and issue with this movie by far...Apart from that, the movie is a very dark yet interesting sci-fi film. It's worth watching once, if you're into dark sci-fi movies.",Dark City
92,Peach-2,A film that will be remembered for years.,10,23 November 1998,"Dark City will be remembered in years to come as a true masterpiece of film-making. It will be along side such films as Blade Runner and Metropolis as statements to the genre. The director, Alex Proyas, could be the next great director of our time. The visuals and set designs in this film can hardly be rivaled by any other film out there. It is simply a beautiful film to look at and admire. The script is tight. I've heard people complain that the film is confusing or weird, but I found it very easy to follow. This movie hypnotized me from the very first frames to the very last. The performances are all top notch and the cinematography is visually stunning. The music from Trevor Jones is perfect for this film. Alex Proyas has only made two films that I know of, and both of them have visuals that stick with you for months afterwards. He has the eye of a great director and reminds me of Kubrick. We could be witnessing the next great director of a future generation. Great film.",Dark City
93,Imdbidia,Retro-futuristic moody movie,7,14 February 2011,"A very engaging retro-futuristic movie, with a very original philosophical story, charming characters, great music, and an intriguing convoluted plot by Alex Proyas. It mixes film noir, sci-fi and action to create a world where the night never ends, its inhabitants have no past, and their present is as schizoid as the city.The film tells the story of Jon Murdock, a man who awakens alone in an hotel room without knowing who he is, but finding himself persecuted by the Police for crimes he doesn't remember committing, and by a group of weird people who want to kill him.--Visuals-- The movie is very stylish, with two different worlds masterly designed. It was a very good ambiance, effective miniature sets, moody colors and lighting, and a wonderful wardrobe. It has many cinematic influences: German expressionism, film noir of the 40s-50s, Hoper's night scenes, and touches of other eras all mixed up in a creative and harmonic collage.Dark city is, indeed, a very dark city where the sun never shines, with dense layered cityscapes that change every night, and a a toxic atmosphere. The city is dominated by dark tones of green, yellow and beige with some colorful elements used as a contrast, with soft blurry textures; on the contrary, the world of the Strangers is sharper, shinier and more metallic, with a predominance of dark bright blues, greens and blacks. All the scenes related to what happen at 12am are very oniric, too. In fact, an oniric feeling permeates the whole film.The special effects in the movie are at the service of the story and, therefore, perfectly integrated. Good for the 1990s.--Themes-- Although the movie did not get good reviews when first released and was accused of being just a an unsubstantial, the movie's plot and storyline reflect on philosophical matters without being pretentious or pedantic. The story, in fact, is an version of the allegory of the cave by Plato, and poses some interesting metaphysical questions: Is the world the way we perceive it? Where is the human soul located, in our heart, our memories, or in our thoughts? Does the place where we live influence what we are? How does the past define the self? Moreover, there is an exploration of human reaction to the processes of alienation and dislocation, and modern urbanism, or the differences between societies dominated by the willpower of the community as a whole, or those in which the sum of individuals is predominant, just to mention a few elements.Proyas was very interested in the book on schizophrenia written by Paniel P. Schreber, a 19th century judge who suffered from dementia, who gives his name to the doctor in the movie. At the same time, some of the the things that happen in the movie are just a reflection of the paranoid dementia behavior that Schreber mentioned in his book.One of the best things of the movie is the fact that the plot is structured in a way that the viewer and the main character are unwinding the mystery at the same time, at the same pace from the same point of view. This makes the movie very engaging and entertaining.--The acting-- All actors are convincing in their respective roles: Rufus Sewell as Jon Murdoch, Jennifer Connelly as Emma/Anna (she still had flesh on her bones, and looks stunning in this film), Kiefer Sutherland as the freaky Dr Paniel P. Schreber, William Hurt as the engaging Inspector Frank Bumstead (this sort of roles really bring out Hurt's acting), Richard O'Brien as Mr Hand, and Ian Richardson as Mr. Book, among others.--The small letter-- I think that the fact that some things are not properly explained, or just not brought to discussion make the movie even more intriguing. For example, how did the citizens arrive at the city? When did that happened? This allows the end to be credible and have a closure, which is a new beginning. However, this is not the case of all the events related to John's childhood, why and how the memories were put in his head and then removed, and the direct involvement of the Strangers in that.--The Director's Cut-- I think that viewing the movie differently would be viewing an incomplete movie, not only because some of the things that happen in the movie are perfectly explained in the director's cut, but not so clear in the original, but also because the movie indulges in artistic filming and shots, which were all removed from the theatrical release.A very original and entertaining movie with stunning visuals and excellent plot, that will remind you of the Matrix sometimes, although it was released a year before the later.",Dark City
94,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A dazzling Sci-fi fantasy beyond your imagination!,10,3 June 2008,"Set in a dark gloomy floating city somewhere in space, a race of malevolent alien beings called ""The Strangers"" have control of the city and the humans who inhabit it. These beings have unique powers that can alter time and reality with the help of Dr. Shaufer (Keifer Sutherland) helps conducts their experiments, John Murdoc (Rufus Sewell) is a man accused of murder who later discovers he has strange powers that can fight against the dastardly bald aliens and bring light back into the world.Dazzling and dark Sci-fi horror fantasy thriller from Alex Proyas (Who brought you ""The Crow"") definitely makes all three genres including film noir work together. It's a cerebral, entertaining and smart movie with chock-loads of atmosphere, great performances especially by William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly including the sexy Melissa George as the hooker, and excellent special effects.Roger Ebert has declared it his favorite movie of 1998, i also think it's the best movie of that year too.Also recommended: ""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Heavy Metal"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""The Matrix Trilogy"", ""Metropolis (1927 and 2001)"", ""City of Lost Children"", ""Krull"", ""Star Trek Saga"", ""The Running Man"", ""Gattaca"", ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Akira"", ""Ghost in The Shell 1 & 2"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""Hellboy"", ""Making Contact (a.k.a.

95,TheTruthofItIs,Dark City is a very darkly lit and sleepy effort,5,20 August 2020,"Alex Proyas's film-noir is a mostly boring affair and sleep-inducing given its very dark settings.

Interesting aside, Mr Book seems to be fashioned from "" B&T Bogus Journey""'s De Nomolos character, from seven yrs earlier.",Dark City
96,MichaelMargetis,"""First came darkness, then came the strangers. "" - Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland)",8,8 November 2005,"After hearing so much praise about one-hit wonder Alex Proyas' (The Crowe) film 'Dark City' I decided I had to rent it. I remember seeing parts of it when it first came out and neither my family or I could get into it. Well, after watching it in full now, I can certainly appreciate the craft that went into making 'Dark City'. Usually when one sees Sci-Fi movies they have pretty ""uh"" expectations - a) a sub-standard plot; b) a bunch of mindless uninventive dialogue; c) cool special effects; d) formulaic and tiresome directing; and e) dreadful and hammy acting. But, for some reason 'Dark City' has a leg up on all those qualities. First off, the plot is familiar but it has never been done or expressed so well. Alex Proyas screenplay does a perfect job getting us in the mindset of the film and so does his eye-popping direction. The dialogue is quick and funny with great one-liners from William Hurt and the strangers. The special effects are awesome and the acting is not what you would expect in a science fiction film. Unlike a poor lead performance by Keanu 'I suck at acting and am a retard' Reeves in 'The Matrix' (which by the way was an outstanding picture), 'Dark City' boasts strong performances from such demanding and well-respected actors such as Kiefer Sutherland (24, A Few Good Men), Oscar Nominee Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind, Requiem for a Dream) and Oscar Winner William Hurt (A History of Violence, Kiss of the Spider Woman), and it also has a great lead performance from a not-as-well-known or respected actor, Rufus Sewell (Bless the Child).'Dark City' is a delightfully grim film that has some neat aspects. I loved the dark setting and the unreal and out-of-time era reminded me of this year's smash hit 'Sin City'. The bad-guys, strangers or aliens are also very neat. They dress like 1920s mafia hit-man and speak in super grammatically correct English accents and have pale vampire-like complexions. The leader of them is played by British film actor veteran Ian Richardson, and you may recognize Richard O'Brien (who played Riff-Raff in Rocky Horror Picture Show and wrote the music/lyrics to it) as the nasty stranger who takes the place as the film's central villain. My only qualm with 'Dark City' is it's unnecessary 'R' rating. The film has no language, mild violence, no sex, but just a very brief scene of nudity. Cmon, people! 'Titanic' had a longer scene of nudity and it managed to slide away squeaky clean with a 'PG-13'. 'Dark City' is a perfect example of the MPAA taking favorites with historical or mock-historical movies over actually better movies and a hell of a lot more creative movies like 'Dark City'. Anyway, that just ticks me off because the R-rating makes 'Dark City' seem crude or extremely violent, but it isn't in any respect.All in all, 'Dark City' is a big step up for the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre. It isn't a masterpiece and has it's flaws (it dragged it's final ten minutes), but it is outstanding for what it is -- a Sci-Fi movie. I recommend this for any action/fantasy movie fans or anyone wanting an escape from all the tiredly mainstream motion pictures. 'Dark City' is a feast for the eyes. Grade: B+",Dark City
97,dfle3,Intriguing sci-fi,10,3 June 2008,"This is one of my favourite movies of a spate of movies dealing with philosophical themes. This group would include The Matrix (reviewed here by me), The Thirteenth Floor and Gattaca.I saw this movie many years ago and it has stuck with me all this time. Don't be put off by my description of these movies as 'philosophical'-they are entertainment first and foremost.The philosophical theme of this movie is, I suppose, the old chestnut of nature versus nurture. Is there an 'essence' to human identity? To use a different example than that in the movie...if Hitler as a young child was reared in religious orphanage or some such, would he have ended up a jolly good chap? Or was he a bad seed who would still give forth rotten fruit? I suppose the flip-side of that would be how the Pope would have fared had he been placed in Hitler's circumstances.The movie deals with these kinds of themes in its own, intriguing way. I don't want to get into much more detail than this.I did read a review of this movie in the Halliwell film guide, I think, and was surprised how low it scored. Not sure, but perhaps the reviewer was misguided into thinking this film lightweight when it is so much more than that. Again, Halliwell seemed to give many poor reviews for movies that I would consider masterpieces, especially Australian movies like Mad Max 2 and Bad Boy Bubby. American snobbery perhaps?This is a terrific genre movie that should not be missed...along with the other movies that I mentioned above.",Dark City
98,SKG-2,Kafkaesque tale dazzling to watch,9,4 February 1999,"When I describe this movie to people, I always tell them if Kafka had written comic books, he might have turned out something like this.  Alex Proyas proves THE CROW was no fluke with this visually dazzling film.  He convincingly creates a world we can accept and marvel at, and he never breaks the rules he sets up.  I missed the emotional connection I felt with THE CROW, perhaps because while Rufus Sewell does a good job in the main role, he doesn't give us that connection.  Still, I found it compelling viewing.  Jennifer Connolly doesn't have a big role, but she adds to the level of weirdness we feel, since she has the most ""normal"" role.  I was surprised to find William Hurt here, but he's very good.  Acting honors, however, go to Kiefer Sutherland, who's better than he's been in a long time.",Dark City
99,Idocamstuf,Movies don't get much better than this!!!!,10,3 June 2003,"What an excellent movie, from the first time I heard about it I knew I would love it, and I did!!!  It starts out with Rufus Sewell asleep in a bathtub in a dark, mysterious world, then several people are murdered, and then he is accused of killing them, after this, the movie unfolds into an amazing mix of sci-fi, mystery, and horror, and not to mention breathtaking action, with outstanding scenery.  This is the kind of movie where all parts of the story do not need to be completely coherent, sort of like ""The Fifth Element"", but this is much, much better.  I can not say enough good things about this movie, certainly the most breathtaking sci-fi I have seen.  Its not ruined by overlength or stupid subplots, its all to the point and extremely fascinating.  I have to give it **** out of ****, and I have only given 3 other movies that rating.  Go see it now!!!!",Dark City
100,domino1003,"Truly ""Dark"" Indeed",9,28 April 2005,"Alex Proyas seems to do his best work in the dark. In his previous work, ""The Crow,"" the story takes place in a dark city in incredibly dark times, with very few shots of light. In ""Dark City,"" we get this in spades. The city has no name and it is ALWAYS dark. No one is really disturbed by this except John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who wakes up in a bathtub with no memory of who he is...and a dead woman in the apartment. He soon realizes that nothing is what it seems. At the strike of midnight, everyone falls asleep except him. Time just stops. Then, The Strangers arrive. With their dark clothes and dead pallor, they control the inhabitants of the city, switching their identities over and over in an attempt to determine the human condition in order to save their race. They also have an ability called ""tuning,"" which can alter the landscapes, making it as they choose. It also seems that Murdoch also has this power (Although how he obtained it is never clearly explained), and is soon a part of the Strangers plans. While trying to avoid The Strangers, he is trying to avoid the police,who believe him to be a serial killer. On his tail is Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt),who is slowly starting to have his doubts about Murdoch, and is wondering why his predecessor seems to have gone mad while trying to solve the murders. Also trying to find Murdoch is Dr. Schreber (Keifer Sutherland), who works with The Strangers, and who has a hidden agenda that may/may not help Murdoch. Jennifer Connelly plays Murdoch's wife Emma, who soon becomes a pawn in The Strangers attempt to capture him.An excellent film, but it leaves a few unanswered questions (Exactly WHERE did the inhabitants of the city come from?). Some viewers may notice interesting similarities between this film and ""The Matrix, which was released the following year. Good performances all around, especially Jennifer Connelly. I've always found her to be a beauty, but when she is in the club, singing those ballads, her beauty really shines. Also of note is Richard O'Brien as Mr. Hand. As he becomes immersed in the human condition, you can almost feel how he longs to be human (Especially when he looks at the picture of Connelly and talks to her). On a more personal note: there's something about the way he says ""surrender."" Whenever he says that, it just sounds sexy!",Dark City
101,AvidClimber,A bewildering situation full of questions without answers,9,14 June 2013,"Dark City is one of those movies that is very difficult to categorized. It makes us experience something truly unique.The good. Extremely imaginative setup. Very dark. Strong intrigue with multiple parts that keeps us guessing for most of the movie.The actors. Rufus Sewell gives us a solid performance as the main confused protagonist, and we feel just like him. On the other hand, as a watcher, it is William Hurt playing the detective who leads our inquiries, trying to understand the mystery as we would. The ever beautiful Jennifer Connelly is adorable in her gentle role. Kiefer Sutherland gives strange ticks to the persona he is playing, making him seem slightly fake.The bad. The green screen shot are poor, and fortunately somewhat rare. The rest of the special effect imperfections can be viewed as ""stylish"" and more easily absorbed.

102,Flagrant-Baronessa,"""I feel like I'm living out someone else's nightmare""",7,26 October 2006,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up alone and naked in a lukewarm seedy bathtub, with blood pouring from a hole in his forehead and with no recollection of how he got there  or even who he is. The phone rings and a breathless doctor tells him he is in grave danger and that 'they' are after him. Bad events snowball into an impossible mess as John discovers the dead body of a prostitute in the other room, and soon it becomes clear that someone is trying to frame him for murder. Now he has to put all the pieces of the puzzle together...So goes the strong, pitch-black opening to an even darker film. 'Dark City' is classic sci-fi with greenish grey hooded alien characters, special effects and a world drastically different from our own. Yet this is the mere window-dressing to an infinitely richer story of Matrix-like proportions. Indeed the two films are highly comparable in both style and substance as they both navigate darkly futuristic worlds in which the citizens are blissfully ignorant of the ongoing brainwashing by a higher power. In Dark City these are 'the strangers'  mysterious invaders who manipulate the way things are run by using telekinetic powers. This includes the debarring of sunlight, casting a perpetual shadow over Dark City.The aforementioned naturally relegates the film to Blade Runner territory. There are clear similarities in the dark, eerie sci-fi urban feel of the city but also, in many ways, in its protagonist Rufus Sewell who is a lonely detective. Less assured than Harrison Ford due to his amnesia of course, but still of the same calibre. Director Alex Proyas both wrote and directed the film and it seems he has drawn a lot of influences from Blade Runner in the sense that he, much like Ridley Scott, filters his story through a noir blender of sorts. His city is coated in a rich film noir atmosphere and one could make a good case for Jennifer Connelly being a femme fatale here; she speaks with a low and sensual voice, she wears red lipstick, she sings mellow jazz at nightclubs.The dark style is both aesthetically intoxicating and endlessly depressing but its characters are enjoyably layered. Rufus Sewell masters the American accent of his character with effortless conviction and it is baffling to see how well this rentable-bad-guy-who-always-loses-the-girl-and-the-plot-to-the-hero translates into a heroic protagonist. William Hurt, excellent as ever, adds a smooth moral ambiguity to the detective he plays in the film. Kiefer Sutherland, however, hands in one of the most peculiar performances I have ever seen; he is quirky and speaks with choppy, breathless words. I have always found Jennifer Connelly to be a bit of a snooze and here she regrettably fully recycles that old riff. Even when William Hurt as the detective reveals to her that her husband (John) is suspected for MURDER, she remains in this sedative, snooze-worthy state. Take it or leave it.Lastly, it needs to be said that Dark City was made as a low-key, low-budget sci-fi diversion and this is apparent in its special effects that are on the hammy side. Nevertheless it compensates for its lack of panache with relevant Matrix-like notions such as: 'are we in fact the mere sum of our memories?' (memories is a big theme in the film). It still does not merit a higher grade than 7 out of 10 for me because it tipped over into listlessness at a few points to many and it feels emotionally distant. Highly worth the watch though.7 out of 10",Dark City
103,lagudafuad,starts slow then picks up,6,25 December 2012,"Dark City does have a grand ending but the buildup is what causes many to feel this movie is just not that good, cause after a while of waiting wanting to see what these ""Strangers"" were up to, there was a point when I just got tired of wanting to see what they were up to and longed for the end of the movie but when I got close to end I found myself sitting up being drawn back into the movie and wanting to see what will happen next.Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow (1994) and I, Robot (2004)) Dark City is his next film after the Crow which saw the end to the life of Brandon Lee, who died on set in the final filming of the 1994 movie (The Crow).The movie plot is about John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who woke up in a bath tub with no idea of who he is (amnesia) but to make it worse he finds a dead girl in his room, then he finds himself on the run from the police as he is being sort for, for murder.While running from the cops, Murdoch attempts to discover who he is and clear his name, when a mysterious group known only as the ""Strangers"" who have psychokinetic ability, were also seeking him to kill.There was fear that many wouldn't understand the movie, due to the very complexity of what goes on, as you the audience are left to determine what is real and what is not, but that is the point of the movie and it added to the flare and the narrative style of the movie, which is good enough to keep you concentrating not lost. Proyas determination to make a horror thriller is what makes the movie dark, but the horror intention of Proyas is missed, as the movie is more thrilling than it is horror. The writing of the movie was done by Proyas, Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer, Goyer who wrote the sequel to Proyas 1994 cult movie The Crow. Proyas initially wrote the movie to focus on the detective Frank Bumstead (William Hurt), but as the movie script was being developed the main plot changed from the detective to the man being chased by the detective, John Murdoch.Dark City was filmed entirely on set, with no location used, with Proyas using the same production designer from his previous film The Crow. This entirely built set showcases excellent cinematography, as we travel between what we know as city and the lair of the Strangers.Dark City is a cult classic movie, and it has grown thanks to Roger Ebert (a popular and notable movie reviewer) and home screenings. Dark City has come to stay, holding a nice rating in many review sites, although the movie was not much of a box office success in 1998, it is still a well talk about movie, one that you can only enjoy if you hang on to the end.www.lagsreviews.com",Dark City
104,skay_baltimore,This film really didn't do it for me,5,19 December 2011,"I watched this movie based upon the recommendation of someone whose opinion I respect. When it was all said and done, this movie simply did not work for me. But such is life -- different strokes for different folks.To begin with, I'm not a big fan of films in which there is an almost total lack of color. I'm not talking about B&W films; I'm talking about color films that intentionally choose to be shot in an almost total absence of color, like The Dark Knight. I'm also not talking about ""film noir"". I've enjoyed several films that focus on the dark aspects of human nature. I simply don't like films that think that by making the entire background drab, it somehow enhances the point it's trying to make. In the case of Dark City, I understand how the absence of color, and daylight, is integral to the plot, I simply felt it was way overdone. (i.e. way too little bang for the buck) ***Major Spoilers Ahead*** Things that bugged me about this film: 1. These so-called advanced beings need Dr. Schreber to perform the final injection? Why is that? They're not capable of doing it themselves? 2. Why would these so-called advanced beings even postulate that they could derive the soul of a human being from memories alone? Choice factors in. Heart factors in. If they were supposed to be advanced, wouldn't they know that? 3. Why would John care what happened to Emma once he realized she wasn't even real to begin with, and that everything that he had been feeling was merely the result of artificial memory implanted information? That's not love. And if this movie is supposed to show how powerful a force love is, then it's all based upon an illusion, and I resented the film's ending as a result. In fact, I resented a lot of the film because it's based upon false logic and it stretches suspension of disbelief beyond acceptable limits.4. For so-called advanced beings, how could they be so inept? It's their world which they totally control, yet they can't even run after -- and catch -- a human being? (even one with admittedly more powers than an average human being) Similarly, for so-called advanced beings, their most powerful weapon is -- a knife? I don't think so.5. I find William Hurt's typical mumbled speaking annoying in any film.6. I found Kiefer Sutherland's stuttering/stammering speaking particularly annoying in this film. Dark City was worth watching once, but I doubt I'd ever spend the time to watch it again. The best way to describe what this movie was like for me is this: Imagine someone telling you a REALLY long joke; one that seems to go on forever. Then you get to the punchline, and you think: ""That was IT? I waited all this time for THAT?!!!"" That's what watching Dark City was like for me.",Dark City

It had a very Kafka-esque feel to it, if I can say that without sounding pompous!

106,supertom-3,"A classic sci-fi thriller, brilliant!!",10,6 April 2002,"This is such a great film. The matrix with a hint of blade runner and a touch of the crow, this film is a visual tour-de-force! The plot is highly imaginative. It is a difficult film to explain, its one you must see yourself, but basically it centres on a man, played by Rufus Sewell, who wakes up in a bath tub with no memory of who he is, he also finds a dead body and then finds he is the lead suspect for a series of brutal murders. The city he is in has strange features to it, at  midnight every single inhabitant is in a state of comatose, and he soon finds that the city is actually an experiment into the human soul, run by strange looking aliens who look like the legend himself Pinhead. The film has plenty of great twists and is always developing right towards a fantastic finish. The acting is top notch by all concerned including Sewell in the lead, William Hurt as a police officer, Richard O Brien and the beautiful Jennifer Connelly. She was in fact the reason I bought the film on DVD, I have always fancied her since I was younger after Labyrinth. Anyway she is good in this despite being voice-overed for some singing scenes. Overall the film is brilliant but its not the acting, or the impressive story that stand out but the amazing effects and stunning visuals. The director Alex Proyas, who did the superb Crow, directs this film brilliantly. His visual style is dark and eerie and his film really unsettles. I was engrossed throughout becuase of the immersive atmosphere built up. Also for a low budget movie, the film had some of the most jaw dropping special effects I have ever seen, I would not have imagined how you could have done these sort of visuals outside of cartoons. The special effects, such as growing buildings, will truely leave you flabbergasted. 10/10 this must goe down as a visual, sci-fi classic like Blade runner. Also not only did the Matrix use some sets from this film but the Wacowski brothers must have got the odd piece of inspiration from this film.",Dark City
107,malkane316,Quick reviews!,8,24 May 2004,"Carrying on with the look of The Crow, Proyas gives Dark City an appropriately nourish atmosphere. Now, did The Matrix rip this off? The similarities are blatant, the opening few scenes are almost identical to the Wachowskis' movie, and some of the early dialogue is the same. The look is similar, as is the story to some extent: your life is being controlled by an outside, unseen force, and the human race is their little play thing. Then again, Proyas' story has elements from Metropolis, and Blade Runner. Sewell's character Murdoch wakes up, with no idea who he is, or who the dead woman beside him is. When he is chased by a group of leather clad baldies, he begins to wonder what the hell is going on. He questions why no-one can remember the last time there was daylight, or remember the way out of the city. Help comes in the form of odd doctor Sutherland, who seems to e the only other person in the city who doesn't mysteriously fall asleep at midnight. Sutherland teaches Murdoch how to harness his powerful gift, and they try to bring down the bad guys. Questions of free will, will arise from this, and like The Matrix, we will wonder whether it would be better not to know. At the end, there is still no escape from the city, although Murdoch's power to create remains. I know many people on this board find Connelly very attractive, I've never been one of those people, but she looks better in this than any other film I've seen her in.",Dark City

Up until the last thirty seconds or so, the visuals are almost too Noir to handle, and you don't want any pesky daylight ruining the effect.This is one of the most visually stunning fantasy films I've seen in over a decade.  The only bad news is that the story is just what would have happened if ""the Truman Show"" and ""the Matrix"" had a kid.  That's okay; I love both of those movies.  I'm giving ""Dark City"" a cozy placement somewhere near the equally underrated films, ""the Dark Crystal"" and ""Return to OZ"".  I won't give any hint as to what happens in this movie, as I had no idea what it was going to be like when I was about to watch it, and I don't want to ruin any of the surprises.Inevitable sci-fi/fantasy geek question:  So who'd win in a deathmatch, Neo or Murdock?",Dark City

If your younger and often think as my son does that 'omg this movies 20 yrs old' then believe me, this one is timeless. A must see if your a Sci fi lover.. and Rufus, Connelly, Hurt and Keifer were all fantastic. Not to mention Jennifer's easy on the eyes... SHES still as beautiful today in SnowPiercer. I remover her in this hugely popular teen movie eons ago (the name of it fails me) where she was in the pool and took off her top, an iconic shot that still lives in the recesses of many men's minds 25 yrs later lol. Top notch movie and even better actors. Strong 8/10... and that's only because I've been spoiled by recent special effects tech, although they were awesome SX for this time period. Enjoy.",Dark City
112,mhasheider,This is science fiction at its' best.,10,9 April 2001,"This is science fiction at its' best and Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"" shows why.

Goyer) create a marvelous story, but the stars of the film are the production designers (George Liddle, Patrick Tatopoulos), the composer (Trevor Jones), the photographer (Dariusz Wolski), and the head(s) of the art direction (Richard Hobbs, Michelle McGahney).",Dark City

114,The_Core,"An uninteresting, uneven film",10,27 September 1999,"""Dark City"" is a 1940's ""film noir"" rehash disguised as science fiction. The problems with this movie involve a weak plot, uneven pacing and an uninteresting story.  What really bothers me is that Roger Ebert panned ""Blade Runner"" for its lack of a human element (which it had in spades), while giving this movie (which has no human element at all to it) four stars.  This speaks to me more of Roger Ebert than the movie, and the fact that he likes to see rehashes of what he considers ""art films.""  Although this movie may have ""art,"" it's completely lacking in ""heart.""  I found ""The Matrix"" a much better film (I've seen both on DVD).  The Matrix had at its base a strong philosophical doctrine, a deeper meaning beyond the prevalent kung-fu scenes that is apt to be remembered for a long time to come. ""Dark City"" is nothing more than a bland mood piece, an emotionless and ultimately meaningless movie that will be lost in the memories of filmgoers as better movies come along.  7/10 for effort.",Dark City
115,nesfilmreviews,A masterpiece of visual design.,7,26 October 2014,"A masterpiece of visual design, ""Dark City"" was ahead of the curve in 1998. The existential themes are explored in a number of comparable films made in the late 90's, most notably the ""Matrix."" Australian director Alex Proyas passionately infuses elements of science fiction, mystery, and film noir in spectacular fashion. Viewers enter into this disorienting world and relies on us to piece together exactly what is going on in this noir metropolis. It's an effective tool as it puts the audience on a level playing field with the main character. A hypnotic and dark movie that takes you on a visually arresting ride, however the movie fails to go beyond the sci-fi/noir genre elements to truly connect on a visceral and emotional level. ""Dark City"" opens by immersing the audience in the midst of a fractured, nightmarish narrative. John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), has amnesia, and he begins his ""awaking"" naked in a bathtub, uncertain of how he got there. His only company in his hotel room is the nude body of a dead prostitute. Suddenly, Murdoch receives a phone call from a man named Dr.Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), who claims to have his best interests at heart. Dr. Schreber warns him to get out of the hotel immediately, and without a clue about his identity, Murdoch is fleeing from phantom-like creatures with supreme mental powers. Soon, his quest to unearth his past brings him to his wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly), who may or may not be an idea planted in his head, and Police Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt), who is tracking him down because he is the prime suspect in a series of murders.Proyas appears to have been so distracted with his unique vision that the story suffers from a lack of narrative focus. The plot is weak, and judging from the dialogue alone, ""Dark City"" is a clumsy melodrama. Which is why, while the majority of the performances are serviceable, it's the sheer overwhelming style that gets us through. Proyas, as in his previous film ""The Crow,"" once again delivers a phenomenal spectacle by creating a somber, despairing ambiance in ""Dark City."" Regardless of its shortcomings, the movie is a worthwhile cinematic experience--a triumph of cinematography, special effects, and visual design.",Dark City
116,Mitch-38,AN EERIE AND FASCINATING TALE,9,13 June 1999,"On the side of honesty, I'll admit that I'm not much of a sci-fi buff. However, the title and talented ensemble involved, intrigued me. WOW! What an odd, murky and thoroughly engrossing motion picture! An extra plus is the well-done special effects. Rufus Sewell is super as the lead, whose line between reality and dreams is merely millimeters thin. Keifer Sutherland is downright bizarre as the doctor. (As an actor, this man's range is limitless). William Hurt gives a superb, subdued performance as the detective. The untied shoelace bit, is quick and clever. Dark City is a well-paced, moody, interesting and creative movie; very well worth your time.",Dark City
117,Mr_Censored,A Brainy Visual Affair.,8,2 March 2010,"Perhaps one of the very first films in the age of DVD to find its audience following a poor theatrical run, ""Dark City"" is the follow-up to director Alex Proyas' other stylistic achievement, the graphic-novel adaptation, ""The Crow."" In the film, our main character, John Murdoch, wakes up in a dingy hotel bath tub, bleeding from his forehead. Scared and confused, he comes to find that he is the suspect in a string of brutal murders and hot on his tale is a mysterious organization known as the Strangers, who oddly resemble the cenobites in Clive Barker's ""Hellraiser,"" but whom have the ability to warp the world around them.Like ""The Crow"" before it, ""Dark City"" is heavy on set-design, bleak atmosphere and memorable visuals, but thankfully, the script (co-written by David S. Goyer) is smart enough not to hinge on special effects and set design, and rather, toys with your expectations while delivering something stream-lined and efficient, instead of being overly long and bloated like it very well could have been. Driving the film is Rufus Sewell as Murdoch, a character who is never sure if what he is seeing or doing is even real. While Sewell sells it, his co-star, Jennifer Connelly, unfortunately isn't given much to do other than look good and sad. Thankfully performances by William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland inject some energy into the narrative, only to bounce off of the underplayed humanity on display by Sewell.While ""The Matrix,"" released a year later, would overshadow its influence on the science fiction world and pop-culture in general, it's worth noting that the film still stands as one of the best genre films of the 90's and begs to be seen by anyone with a love for sci-fi in need of some refreshment. It's perhaps the best film by Proyas, and at a breezy 96 minutes, it gets the job done well, never wasting a moment or sacrificing exposition. Even if you're not sold on its plot, you'll at least be mesmerized by its visuals, which in and of itself, is worth the price of admission.",Dark City
118,GirishGowda,Existential sci-fi!,8,25 March 2012,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up alone in a strange hotel to find that he has lost his memory and is wanted for a series of brutal and bizarre murders involving hookers. An eccentric doctor, Daniel (Kiefer Sutherland) and his wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly) try to make him get a grasp of things. While trying to piece together his past, he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld cult controlled by a group of beings known as The Strangers who possess the ability to put people to sleep and physically alter the city and its inhabitants lives as they please through the power of their will or telekinetic powers. John discovers that he has the power of The Strangers as well. Now he must find a way to stop them before they take control of his mind and destroy him.The title ""Dark City"" is highly apt since there is no sunlight for most of the running time of the movie and the distinct, grainy, dark tone makes the movie feel almost poetic in its nature. The movie establishes the basic premise early on when we are let into the secret that nothing is as it seems and this might all be happening inside our lead, John's head. I was having ""The Matrix"" feeling over and over again while the movie was unfolding. But it quickly explains itself and we understand that it doesn't happen inside the characters heads. The situations playing out are real, except the people playing them are not who they think they are. This is a mind-bender of a movie which is primarily a mystery thriller at its core. Who are the Strangers? How can John tune into their powers? What do the strangers want with this city folk? Are the Strangers, aliens or mutants? To what end are they experimenting with the people and why is the soul so important to them? This is a wonderful gem of a movie from Alexander Proyas, the director of ""I, Robot"", ""The Crow"" and ""Knowing"". The movie deals with the human soul and memories. Whether we are the product of our past actions, being ourselves through our memories or being who we are from another core place which has nothing to do with our past, but only our feelings. Proyas tells this complicated story through the actions of the characters. Most of the characters are intriguing and genuinely compelling. Kiefer Sutherland was outstanding in his portrayal of an eccentric scientist who has no memories of his own, but yet wants to defeat the Strangers. I have never seen this side of Jack Bauer and it somehow felt quite satisfying to see this awesome actor as such a varied character. Jennifer Connelly does well with the material that she had. William Hurt as Inspector Frank was amazing. The ending moments with his shoelaces untied, reminding him that his personality may have been switched with his subordinate was powerful. I was waiting for Rufus Sewell to turn into Jude Law for the whole movie! He resembles Law so much and Law would have been a better choice for this movie and it was very distracting. The only letdown of sorts is the climax which is over the top cheesy with the visual effects and one man bringing the system down storyline. He is one guy in a controlled experiment. They still couldn't catch him! Still, this is a very good sci-fi movie with the character interactions and mystery forming a very strong foundation. If you like Inception, The Matrix kind of movies, then this one is for you.8/10",Dark City

120,freaky_dave,An Incredible film and one where the Matrix got many of its ideas,9,13 May 2006,"Dark City was a phenomenal film that very few people know about. It is a dark surreal film from which the Matrix took many of its ideas.Yes people, Dark City, released in 1998, came out before The Matrix, and it is, in my opinion, a somewhat better film also. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the Matrix just about as much as everybody else, but the concepts for the Matrix came from this gem of a film which involves a group of creatures dressed in leather who are able to stop time and bend and shape reality as they want to.Human beings are used as experiments during these changes as these creatures, called The Strangers, put them to sleep with their special abilities. Afterward they shift reality and the humans sometimes wake up unknowingly as somebody else or remain the same with only there memories erased from previous times.Of course one day and experiment goes wrong with one of the subjects as he wakes up before he is supposed to. His name is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell)and he wakes up without knowing who he is in a bathtub. He is soon seeking to unravel the mystery of his life, and soon discovers that he also has abilities just like The Strangers, and quickly realizes after that that things aren't always what they seem in this strange world of illusion.Also starring Jennifer Connelly, Keifer Sutherland, and William Hurt, Dark City is a truly magnificent visual experience that will have you completely stunned as the hero unravels the mystery of The Strangers, and the dark gloomy world that comprises them all. The ending fight scene is the only thing that takes away from the movies appeal because it seems a little contrived, but other than that, this film is definitely one of the best science fiction films of the modern era.",Dark City

The young teens won't understand much of it they will go in for the neat lighting effects, the scenery, the fast pace of the film, and the comic book like script. I watched this movie because 1) I am a SciFi fan and 2) Keifer Sutherland was in this film. This film sort of reminds me of the movie, The Matrix. The movie keeps you interested and wondering what was coming around the corner next. The lighting in the film gives it a somewhat surrealistic feel. The actors work well together and make one believe that we are back in the 1930s/40s. William Hurt also does a good job acting. Although the film could be used in teenage parties, it is a film which will keep the audience quiet and glued to their seats eating popcorn. It will keep you entertained for its run.

123,datorsiers2,"Begins well, but goes down hill.",5,2 December 2015,"The first couple of minutes get you excited, we get presented with this dark mysterious city and a guy who wakes up to find out he doesn't remember anything. Unfortunately throughout the film you lose the excitement as the tension strangely decreases.First of all this film has many big plot holes and flaws, but that is not even worth mentioning, because everything else was kind of mediocre as well. It makes me really sad to see and awesome idea getting executed so poorly, there could have been so many alternate scenes that would have made the movie more appealing. I really didn't like the villains, they are these super intelligent aliens, who can easily control time and people's minds, levitate, change terrain, but still they bring a small knife to fight Murdock? That's like having and ak47, but choosing to fight with bare hands, for Christ's sake.People praise this movie for its originality, alright i will give this movie credit for being original, that is a fact, but other than that it's kind of plain. The acting was quite weak too, to be honest, in some scenes it felt like the actors are not really familiar with the idea of the film. At least Jennifer Connelly made this movie look more appealing with her stunning looks, but it wasn't all about her, so we just have to sit through this sort of boring, illogical movie and try to enjoy all the other mediocre actors here.Some people might say it is insanely complex and thought provoking. No, it is not, apparently they just haven't seen many movies, maybe it somehow could be thought provoking if you really like to dig deep and think about all the little details, but in that case, you can brainstorm after every movie and associate different things to it, so i don't buy this idea. It is dark, flashy, exciting at times, but mostly boring, unfortunately. Die hard sci-fi fans will probably still enjoy this mediocre little flick.",Dark City

125,MF210,Unfairly Overlooked,9,19 January 2004,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****.When Dark City came out in 1998 it was not a box office success. In fact, it was a failure. It did receive some good reviews, especially from critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert. But it did not stay in theaters for more than a few weeks.I am one of the few people I know that saw this film in the theater. I just recently got the DVD for Christmas and watched it. I got alot more out of the film than I did five years ago. It provides some really thought-provoking about our memories. Dark City is an intelligent film thats more rewarding if you think about the film while watching. There are no easy answers here though, director/screenwriter Alex Proyas wants you to think about the film, instead of him just overexplaining it.When talking about the film, it is impossible not to mention how much style is in this film. The vision of this city is absolutely stunning. I immediately recalled images of Tim Burton's oh so memorable vision of Gotham City in Batman. Both of those visions are gothic and absolutely stunning. The film is also drenched in atmosphere. Dark City has one of the most stylish visions I have ever seen in a film.The acting is solid. Rufus Sewell is solid as John Murdoch. Some complain about Kiefer Sutherlands performance but I think it works well here. Jennifer Connelly puts her heart and soul into her perfomance as Emma Murdoch. William Hurt is very effective as the detective. Richard O'Brien is excellent and at times chilling as Mr. Hand.There have been many comparisons with Dark City and the very popular Matrix. Its true they both have similar ideas but Dark City maybe a little more thought-provoking. Also, Dark City did not need two money driven sequels(although its questionable if The Matrix really did need them). I love both films equally, but if someone said Dark City was better than The Matrix I would understand.Dark City does have one small(and weird)flaw. At times I feel the pacing is a little fast, especially the first 30-40 minutes. However, thats a small flaw that does not hurt the film horribly.",Dark City

At the start I felt it was fairly incoherent, but as with many films it explains itself clearly so by the end of the film the viewer can understand or at least appreciate what the entire film was about, and what messages it was trying to convey. There are some truly creepy scenes in this film, but they are all done so well. The special effects are fantastic, and the acting is well above average, especially for a science fiction film. Its one of the films that you can go away thinking about, trying to piece together the puzzle. It was nice to see Kiefer Sutherland back in form, and Jennifer Connelly have more than a supporting role for a change. The whole concept of the film was very unique, which made it interesting to watch. Probably not a film for all tastes, but for anyone that likes sci-fi its a definite must see.",Dark City

Murdoch seeks to unravel the twisted riddle of his identity. But in a city where reality is the ultimate illusion, discovering the truth could be fatal. Director Alex Proyas gives us a great plot which is being unraveled step by step. He gives us a lot of symbolism in the movie and with great special effects. There are so many good things about this movie that I could say but it would take me forever to finish. However I will say 3 of them. 1. The acting is incredible 2. The film is like a film-noir and scifi film put together which I liked and 3. The movie hardly deviates away from the plot.10/10",Dark City
128,CrassActionHero,Truly Dark.,10,14 September 2006,"Dark City (1998) New Line Cinema.Review: Dark City being directed by Alex Proyas, who directed the dark thriller The Crow, I had to see this movie. This is an original, dark, engaging, and one of the best movies of 1998.The story is the best. A man who wakes up in a bathtub has no memory at all. He discovers that some ominous beings are coming after him. Who are they? What do they want? And to top it off, he is a suspect in several murders. As the story unfolds, it just gets more interesting. The look of the city is quite a sight. It has an old school comic book feel to it. The style of everything is a nice 1940's style, from clothing to the cars. As we follow our hero, we learn more about him....or do we? What is real? What is fake? Questions keep coming up but, are their any answers to all these questions? Even more weird is when at the stroke of midnight, the city changes shape while everyone sleeps.Our hero is also followed by an honest detective, Insp. Bumstead, who just wants answers to the murders and gets involved in the mystery too. Our hero wants to look for one location that could unlock the mystery to everything. What could it be? Another strong point here is the acting is excellent. Rufus Sewell plays his role with conviction and passion. The casting is flawless. The Last Word: Awesome flick. This is a movie that is excellent brain food. It makes you think....a lot. You will most likely watch this over and over again to figure everything out. No problem. This movie never gets old. Highly recommended.",Dark City
129,arthera09,Great Sci-Fi,8,22 August 2010,"I remember watching this movie when I was in my late teens sometime after watching the Matrix for the first time and thinking that the Matrix just ripped this movie off in a lot of different ways, even the final showdown between the hero and villain. They just combine the ""brain in the vat"" idea that one learns in a freshman philosophy course and this movie to get the Matrix.I think Proyas crafted a nearly perfect science fiction film. It delves into the idea of self and what makes us human. The same questions that the Strangers ask are the same questions that we ask ourselves, but we are not closer to the truth than then are. By expanding the boundaries of reality Proyas provided us a mirror in which we may examine human existence, which has haunted us since we were able to ask ponder the concept.At first the miniature work was off putting, but eventually it grew on me until it added to surrealism of the movie. The atmosphere was pitch perfect throughout and the lighting throughout the film was perfect. Considering the movie occurs mostly with little light I never found that the movie was too dark, but always just the right level of lighting. I loved the combination of the different periods and the noir feel that was brought to the film. I really think this movie could be considered a noir film.I really like William Hurt in most things that he is in and here he brings all the brevity needed for a good noir detective. Jennifer Connelly was beautiful as always, but did not bring too much to the table. I ended up loving Sutherland's character even though I was annoyed with him at first. His speech pattern really elevated the sense that nothing in this universe makes sense. He is the only one that knows what is going on, but he is the only character, except for the Strangers, who does not feel like they belong. I must say that I was not thrilled with Sewell and I feel as if there may be another actor that could have pulled this role better. He was not bad by any means, but I never connected with him in the way I think Proyas intended.This movie is really on the verge of being a masterpiece and the main criticism for the movie is the ending. I loved the idea of the ending the movie the way that it did, but at the end of the movie I was thinking that I wish the music was better. I got really pulled out of the scene because I felt like the music was not in tune with the scene. Also Sewell took to the idea that he would be the ultimate creator of the universe in stride. Maybe it was built into the memories that Sutherland gave him, but he just kind of went with it and did not really look back about it.I really do enjoy this movie and its originality puts above most films out there. This is the type of movie that I would love to share with people and show them that film making is not just about explosions, but that atmosphere and an original story can be truly entertaining. It is just too bad that the ending fell flat for me or this would have gone done in my mind as one of the best films of the 90's.",Dark City

A great film that i recommend to all movie lovers out there, whether they like or don't like SF's.Dark City is a complex thriller - fiction title that has many new things and a great story. A place where people have no past, no memories, nothing true to relate them to their real lives. A place where people are subjects to an alien experiment about their souls, about what makes them human.The story, as i said, is really complex, original and well built. There are, still, moments when this movie reminds me of Matrix, especially in the beginning, when Sutherland contacts Sewell and tells him that he is the one, and people are after him right as they speak.Except for the great plot and story, once you see this title, you will not be able to forget the great atmosphere. The city where there is no sun is greatly built. There's a touch of the 40s and 50s, with the rooms and buildings and also the hats people wear. There is also  a powerful sense of 12 Monkeys, well not actually 12 Monkeys, but of Terry Gilliam.The directing is good, the acting also, maybe except for William Hurt's. A guy that never manages to escape from his low style of playing.All in all, Dark City is a ""must"". Go see it, you won't be sorry. Vote: 9 out of 10.",Dark City

Elements of film noir, Gothic comics and classic horror are blended in harmony, while he retains total control of everything. The visual effects in contrast to 'the Matrix' are so well integrated into the storytelling, that you don't even notice them (there are no kung fu sequences here), another proof of Proyas' skills.Spoiler: You want to know what happens in the next 'Matrix' movies?

Take out the visuals, which are not all that great by the way (the mother ship has a cartoonish texture on it) and you have a boring version of Dark City. Incidentally, both movies were filmed in Australia.Of course 'The Matrix' is easily digested by large audiences, so it's easier to promote and even to maintain. It's got techno-music, kung fu sequences and designer clothes. 'Dark City' is dark, creepy and Gothic. It's not your average teen movie.'Dark City' is a masterpiece of modern cinema. The story is unfolding at a captivating pace. The truth is slowly revealed and new facts are shown even at the end of the movie. The cast is superb and the leading man Rufus Sewell gives an excellent performance. The director Alex Proyas, delivers another dark brilliance after 'The Crow'. His job is unbelievably good for such a complex movie. Elements of film noir, Gothic comics and classic horror are blended in harmony, while Proyas retains total control of everything. The visual effects in contrast to 'the Matrix', are so well integrated into the storytelling, that you don't even notice them (there are no martial arts sequences here), another proof of Proyas' skills.The only minor weakness is the opening voice-over that was actually studio imposed. If only these fat studio executives let the artists do their work undistracted, we would enjoy a much better cinema.Now you might be wondering why there wasn't any formal complaint or even a lawsuit against the creators of 'the Matrix'? Is it a coincidence that Proyas, a highly creative genius, hasn't made any other film since then? Hollywood has a way with promoting whoever they feel like and maybe they didn't want someone who created the Matrix's concept to be around. Because how can the promote the hell out of 'the Matrix', when someone who's done this movie in the past, is still active.Spoiler: You want to know what happens in the next 'Matrix' movies? Just watch the last 10 minutes of Dark City.",Dark City
134,polednick,Fantastic Voyage,8,23 April 2021,Just a few minutes watching this movie and the setup reminds me strongly of 1 movie: City of lost children and 1 book: Momo.It is an real roller coaster for the brain.For the full impact you must watch this movie and stop reading reviews about it.Watch and enjoy it!!!,Dark City
135,Vampenguin,One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time,9,20 June 2006,"I don't really want to say a lot about this movie for fear of spoiling anything, so I'll keep this short and sweet.First off: The plot is incredible. If you thought The Matrix was thought provoking, this will blow your mind.The cinematography and overall design of this film are also incredible. Very dark, very surreal. Along with the spectacular effects, the whole movie looks great.The actors are all very good as well, especially Keifer Sutherland.Put simply, you have to see this movie. One of the best sci-fi films I've ever seen.9/10",Dark City
136,cosmorados,"First their was the darkness, and then it got darker!",8,12 June 2008,"The story of John Murdoch is a simple one that I'm sure we can all relate to. You wake up in a bath with no idea who you are only to find a dead woman in your apartment and find out that you are a twisted murderer ...Wait a minute? This isn't relate-able at all! This is the nightmare scenario the hero (Yes Hero!) finds himself in the beginning of the movie, chased by cops and god only knows what else as the world he inhabits seems to close in around him. Unable to decipher who he is and faced with terrifying half memories that don't even seem to relate to him, he spirals blindly through the world searching for answers that no-one has.There have been many comparisons to the Matrix with this film and while it is true that the matrix is a more polished film that this, there is still much here to be admired, from the realisation of the reality they inhabit to the fantastic claustrophobic set design. The direction gives nothing away until the big reveal which is just amazing. The cast are top drawer with a great turn from Keifer Sutherland and the beautiful Jennifer Connolly in the days she weighed more than 6 stone (mmmm!) but the real star is the Uber-impressive Rufus Sewell, who as the hopelessly confused Murdoch is absolutely magic, this is hands down the best film he has ever done.The effects in this film, while nothing special compared to the grand, eye-catching effects in the standard Hollywood fare we see these days, are used to great effect to create a chilling atmosphere where nothing is real and everything can be manipulated to be different in the blink of an eye.It is a shame that this film did not get the recognition it deserved but it's nice to see that IMDb members do tend to know a good film when they see one.Nuff said.Em.",Dark City
137,JeffG.,One of the best movies of the 90's!,10,5 July 1999,"This is a movie I really wish I saw on the big screen. When it was in theaters, I passed it up, thinking it was just another dumb sci-fi movie that was another noise special effects movie devoid of plot or fully realized characters. When I rented it on video, I realized how wrong I was! Sure, the special effects are great, but the story was really engaging. Wonderful direction, fine acting and music really compliment the film as well. I wish Hollywood made more movies like this nowadays.",Dark City
138,cofemug,"Required viewing for lovers of ""Metropolis"" and ""Blade Runner""",9,9 August 1999,"This is what I call a great movie.  I loved this movie when it first came out, in 1998, and I saw it again and I still love it.  This movie is visually stunning like no other movie.  The special effects were even somewhat ripped off for ""The Matrix,"" which is one of the very few similarities that I can think of.  This movie is not about alternate realities like ""The Matrix"" or ""Thirteenth Floor.""  This movie is about studies and science.  This is a science fiction movie WITH the science still in it.  It is a slow, thoughtful movie that will make you think about your life as a whole.  Plot:  Can't reveal the plot otherwise I will spoil everything.  However, I will also suggest that you mute the beginning voice-over because it gives way too much away.  It gives you a basis for the rest of the movie.  If you forget about the voice-over, you will be as confused as the man in the bathtub.Presentation:  The whole movie has an eerie, classic sense.  It feels more like a film noir than ""LA Confidential.""  You have the sense of the detective and almost can read what he would say in a voice over.  But you can only guess, which is part of the fun.  The sets are fabulous and dark. They seem to fit all into place.  The camera angles just look strange and twisted, which adds to the effect of the movie.  I recommend watching the DVD version with Roger Ebert's commentary, and you will notice a lot more in the movie.  Such as the quick cuts of static shots to start to confuse you, and later the camera moves more and more.  Great choice of film work.
This movie is a great movie for those who think and analyze.  If you don't like movies with intelligence, or don't like to be confused or don't like movies that have almost no brightness in them, skip this movie.  This movie is dark, and almost dreary.  It is a great movie that makes you watch and think about it.  I highly recommend this movie to all others.-------------9",Dark City
139,pepekwa,surprised at the great reviews,3,8 June 2008,"there are some movies on here that it seems inspire a cult following and get very high ratings because only these people want to comment on it, others don't bother. This is one of those. Its not a terrible movie and visually its very well done but you don't buy a video game for the graphics,you buy it for the playability. This is very dark, the darkest of film noirs and it doesn't help that because of conflicting images, you don't even know what decade it appears to be set in. The story and plot is very muddled and it took almost three quarters of the film for me to make some sort of head or tail of what is going on. I won't bore you anymore with the reasons why I didn't like it, but it was interesting to read how many of the fans of this compared this and said this was far superior to the first matrix. As a comparison, the first matrix engaged the viewer from the off, clearly showed the viewer what direction it as heading in,was stylish and hip, had some killer action sequences and subtle and clever moments around a story that while pertaining to the future kept its feet in the present. Dark City checked none of these boxes.",Dark City
140,Lupercali,"Dark, moody, clever, and quite silly",7,4 June 2004,"First, just for the record, this film did not rip off 'The Matrix'. It came out a year earlier. Such arguments seem pointless to me anyway, since the basic premise both of these movies, plus 'The Thirteenth Floor', 'The Truman Show', 'Pleasantville', et al are so blatantly appropriated from Philip K Dick's SF of the 1950's. Never mind that, though. This is another ""What is reality"" film (a question Dick apparently used to pose himself every morning); this time the variation being that an alien race has abducted a city of humans and is performing experiments on them to try to find out the nature of the human soul. That isn't a spoiler, BTW. In fact the very first thing that happens in this film is that the narrator tells you what I just told you. You can't help but wonder if it might have served to achieve a better sense of mystery if they hadn't thought to lay that on you in the first 30 seconds, but the film manages to be quite suspenseful all the same.'Dark City' is directed by the bloke who brought us 'The Crow', which I thought was utter rubbish. It has a similar dark, stylised look, which will probably appeal to goths - but in 'Dark City' there is at least a reason for this perpetual night. 'Dark City' is SF, nominally, but the kernel of hard SF which mostly emerges (quite pleasingly) at the end of the movie is subsumed by the complete stylization of the movie's visual elements. There really isn't any need for the aliens to all look and talk like Riff-Raff from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show', for the scary, gruesome, dark sets - for the fact that people are driving 1960's cars around and wearing 1940's fashions. There is no need to have an evil little kid alien, or for the aliens to all chatter their teeth when they do something ominous. You have got get over the silliness of this sort of stuff and appreciate that it's just part of the weird, atmospheric world the director has created. Really it all owes as much to comic book horror and super-hero stuff as it does to traditional science fiction.'Dark City' is the sort of film which can easily annoy you if you allow it to, but if you can forgive its affectations and the fact that it doesn't even attempt to explain various obvious logical oddities (e.g. why don't people who collapse face-first in a bowl of porridge drown after a few hours?) then the film can win you over as the hero goes through his version of taking the red pill (or was it the blue one? I always forget.)This film also raises several important questions about Kiefer Sutherland. How come his glasses don't fall off when he's hanging upside down? Why does he speak haltingly, stutteringly, EXCEPT when he's stressed out? Did he just get this job because his dad knew the producer? Fortunately Sutherland's typically ridiculous acting is balanced to an extent by William Hurt as Inspector Bumstead (honestly!) - the cop who's chasing after the hero. Hurt is, as always, almost completely devoid of personality, and looks as if he's in a trance most of the time. Of course he's always like this, but in this movie it actually makes sense.Rufus Sewell is fine as the hero - the guy who 'wakes up' - and so is Jennifer Connelly as his 'wife'. The aliens are all over the top and silly, and they float through the air and chatter their teeth, but like I said, you have to just think comic-book, and you can forgive it all.In some ways 'Dark City' is a film that I hate myself for liking, but the truth is it's a pretty darn effective, if somewhat ridiculous SF story, and what makes it work are precisely the things that make it silly. Go figure. 7 out of 10.",Dark City
141,thehumanduvet,Love it or hate it type thing,9,3 August 2000,"Judging by the biggish stack of comments this has already received it's clearly a love or hate experience, and I was quite ready to go either way. I'm glad to say I fell pretty much into the love it camp; it has some flaws but has some pretty impressive stuff going on to make up for them. It really is a curious blend of genres, combining influences from lots of previous works and genres. The look of the thing mixes City of the Lost Children with Soderburgh's Kafka, with a bit of Brazil and Gattaca thrown in; the mood is also a bit Kafka-y, noirish and muted, especially Hurt's slow-talking copper. The special effects of the twisting city are incredible, I would love to have seen it on a big screen instead of a battered old video tape that made it even darker than intended. The story is quite gripping too, some clever ideas strung together nicely to make a genuinely nightmarish world. It is occasionally let down by cheesy, cliched dialogue and the odd wobbly performance, though most of the leads acquit themselves well and the script is perhaps deliberately weirded due to the weirding effects of the weird city.
Comparisons to the Matrix are easy and obvious, and there are a lot of parallels, but each film has it's own strengths. This film has no scene as powerful as the boy Keanu sitting up in his bowl of goop and realising what's happened to humanity, and no sense that the ""special powers"" are merely enhanced perception and understanding; the ""Tuning"" here is purely a magical gift, underexplained and underutilised. However, the Matrix is no match for the mood of restrained creepiness of the Dark City; where Matrix world was pretty normal and happy, this place is black and twisted, the minds of its inhabitants messed up and perpetually bemused and vague. Where the Matrix has shocks and speedily-resolved tension, this has an all-pervading feeling of dread and confusion that just won't go away.Rufus Sewell is good in the lead role, at least until the rather unconvincing climax, and Richard O'Brien, Ian Richardson et al are sufficiently spooky as the baddies; Kiefer Sutherland's Doctor I'm still not sure about, but the scene near the end where he describes his pact with the Strangers is one of the film's most powerful.  Overall, you'll probably love it if you like retro-noir sci-fi, mind-altering horror or Angel from Home&Away, otherwise, you should probably watch it anyway, even if just for those amazing visuals.",Dark City
142,Fever,A true masterpiece,10,12 August 1998,"I happened to see this movie because ""Lost in Space"" was sold out. Man, am I glad I saw this one instead. It is an excellent movie. Well filmed and acted, with a brilliant story and stunning effects. This movie finally takes us back to when movies actually had a plot and entertained us. Critics called it ""a true sci-fi flick"" and I couldn't agree more. Not sci -fi like T2 or Aliens, but sci-fi in expanding our imagination, our reality and our perceptions. People have got to see this one.",Dark City
143,CCsito,Very surreal movie,8,17 September 2009,"This movie begins with a man who wakes up in a bathtub confused as to how he got to where he was. Not to give too much away about the movie, he then tries to piece together everything that he sees in his world and to find out who he actually is. The movie has elements of other science fiction series that I have seen. The plot reminds me of aspects borrowed from the Borg from Star Trek, the Next Generation, Steven King's the Langoliers, and the Menagerie episode from Star Trek, the original series. The movie has mystery and a decent storyline that sustains it to the end. There are a few plot inconsistencies, but easy to look past them. The biggest strong point of the movie is the impressive visual effects. For the movie rating, there are a couple of nude scenes (female and male), minimal violence (not too gory), and no profanity that I recalled. Recommended viewing.",Dark City
144,mattrochman,"Excellent and Original, but some shortcoming there",7,15 July 2006,"There was something very original about this film and it did not seem to fall into pathetic standard-plot twists and devices. It set out on a mission and stuck to it. I'd say that the film-makers would have been very happy with the finished ""product.""But there were some shortcomings. First, I felt that Kiefer Sutherland was not quite right in this film. The agitated, rambling character was simply not right for an actor of his ability. It almost seemed forced and the inconsistency in Sutherland's efforts to press the nuances of his character were evident at times.Second, I felt that there was too much of an attempt to unravel human behaviour. I appreciate that it was a sub-theme, but the film makers seemed to explore it without giving an insight or thorough reflection.However, as far as sci-fi genre films go, this is way up there as it bursts with originality and moves at a modest pace - exploring the intricacies of the story line and providing a good build up, but was neither overly long nor rushed. Sits nicely along side Twelve Monkeys as one of the best in this genre for the past 20 years. Filmed in Australia!",Dark City

146,BB-15,A Good Gothic Sci-fi Blend,8,31 May 1999,"Writer, director, Alex Proyas, is in some ways like George Lucas. Proyas in Dark City borrows from 20 to 30 other films; mixes it together with style and polish and creates a very interesting science fiction experience. The foundation of Dark City is the German Expressionist films of the 1920's, Metropolis as well as early horror films from Universal Studios such as Frankenstein. All these influences give Dark City a very sharp black and white look with some terrific sets. The heart of the movie is a mystery and sometimes felt like a 1940's film noir detective story. The film also absorbs the paranoid sci-fi of the 1950's. Add a touch from Scanners and you have a plot that feels like a nightmare and yet has another interesting, deeper meaning.Dark City does not get bogged down with all of these images and ideas. The editing is sharp. The acting is often haunting. And the special effects are just right.Also like George Lucas, Proyas creates an interesting alternate world but I doubt if anyone would like to live there. Enjoying this film depends on how far you would like your mind stretched. Are you looking for a twisted experience like a David Lynch film or is the Truman Show as far as you care to go. If mentally traveling to an incredible often frightening place is what you want, then Dark City is your ticket.",Dark City
147,Sinnerman,Matrix this is not...it much much better.,10,2 May 2003,"I will be part of the rabid throngs of people lining up to catch a spectacle as huge as Reloaded and Revolution. Despite(and maybe because of) Matrix sky high hype right now, my thoughts drift back to this overlooked classic...but a little on Neo and gang first below...The Matrix just happened.With an uncanny midas touch, The Warchowski bros launched this(then unknown film) at the the right place, in the right time. With an execution commercial enough to bring in the box office moola and a philosophical subtext accessible enough for the general public to latch on to, the rest, as they say...is history.The philosophical under pinnings though, (of blue pills, red pills, the subreality of consciousness and all that mambo jambo etc), so successfully popularised by The Matrix, was infact neither originated by  The Matrix nor as fully realised than in other more accomplished works.Which leads me to....drumroll.....As such, IMHO, the best execution on the concept of reality and perception was already explored in a much more unbelievably visual opus, one year earlier, the grossly overlooked, criminally under-rated,""Dark City"". (One of My Top 10 All time Favourite Films)This scifi/ film noir hybrid was impactful both cinematically and ideologically. Most importantly, it rewarded my wildly abandoned reach for human imagination and thirst for ideas, by fulfilling as much promise a motion picture can ever hope to give.On top of that, my background as a ""trekkie"" scifi nerd meant I instinctively respond to films which challenge me both intellectually and spiritually. Dark City was thus a near religious, life cleansing experience for me.And any which way I look at it, this film soars to heights unseen since 2001: A Space Odyssey...But due to its messed up(or near-absent) marketing campaign(positioning the film to resemble a horror film for the teenage crowd), the film did not find its intended audience and flopped unceremoniously. Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...That said, the thirst for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.And The Matrix filled that void.Too bad it wasn't this film.

A similiar vein to Matrix, but with a different twist (yes, I have seen both these great movies). The city is presented to us as 'film noir', creepy, always-night, its inhabitants more like robots than humans. This is one of those films that uses plenty of C.G.I (Star Wars TPM anyone?) but it is used to good effect and adds to the story without ruining it.

I am glad i was able to pick up a copy for less than eight bucks because it was a huge bargain for a great movie. Dark City follows a guy who wakes up in bathtub and finds a dead body in the next room. He then discovers he is wanted for a bunch of other murders. The catch is he doesn't remember a thing. I don't wanna say to much because you should really see it for yourself. Rufus Sewell (who i had never heard of) Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly (yummy) and William Hurt all give great performances (the best though is from Richard O'Brien who plays the enigmatic and downright cool Mr. Hand), but the i think the real stars are the writers who make an original plot with plenty of clever twists and dialogue, and the set and graphic designers who make one of the coolest looking cities i have ever seen.

Where are the signs I missed? Why did John Murdoch have telepathic powers superior to the Strangers? Why did Emma/Anna stand alone at the pier?

After all the good things I had read about it, I was expecting something outstanding, somewhere between ""Brazil"", ""La Cité des Enfants perdus"" and ""Blade Runner"".What a waste of time. I don't get it that so many people don't realize the emptiness of this.All the elements of this movie are stolen from other people's works. Well it's no the real problem as movies are often made out of pieces of other movies, sometimes with success. It can even turn into an art in itself. But then it needs intelligence to introduce some consistency, some vision, or some interesting distance. Nothing like this here. A pure immature, soulless, self-conscious, sophomoric patchwork.This ""sci-fi"" (actually much more fantasy than sci-fi BTW!) world has no inner consistency, and is made up of bits and pieces just put together without any sense of unity. The filmmakers don't even try actually, as if these guys considered that looking cool, original and different was enough. Well this was a good bet, as it seems like thousands of people actually bought this vapid nonsense. Shows the actual depth of today's popular culture in sci-fi and fantasy.Personally, when it comes to vapid ""cool"" stuff, I still prefer to watch some Buffy episode. At least, it doesn't try to make you believe you're watching some life-altering peace of art...And when it comes to present a new world on the screen, I'll keep up with Brazil, Delicatessen, La Cité des enfants perdus, ExistenZ, The nightmare before Christmas, Kafka, Santa Sangre, Eraserhead, Blade Runner, Enrendira, Metropolis, and of course A Clockwork Orange and 2001.

So, kudos all around for that stuff. However, there isn't a single character that you can care about. Not even the good guy. There's no depth to any of them. No real interaction between them. It's all action & F/X. The whole thing is dark, fast moving, and soul-less. This is similar to a well-done action flick, which all the hardcore action buffs will give 10-ratings to, and everyone else will fall asleep while watching it.For the record, I enjoyed the Matrix (first one only, of course.) this flick?

158,JohnnyPHreak,Put The Matrix on Acid and you get Dark City (Minor Spoilers),8,26 July 2000,"It's so coincidental it's scary. Dark City is a Sci-Fi thriller that is like the Matrix if only it was clone and on acid. It stars Rufus Sewell as John Murdoch, a man who wakes up only to find out he has a wife that he never met, the cops want him because they think he's a brutal serial killer and to top things off he has telekinetic powers and can change things with his mind. This film moves almost identical to the Matrix. It also has that distinctive Matrix look and feel. The colors are extremely dark and drab. Plus the special effects are incredible. This film came out a year before Star Wars and  The Matrix and it almost beats them both in the CGI department. I can not believe that it didn't take home an Oscar. The look of this film is amazing and will have you in a daze. The performances are all right. William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly, and Kiefer Sutherland do a good job for supporting characters. This film is edgy, thrilling, mind blowing and will shock you. Dark City is the father and The Matrix is it's baby.

159,fibreoptic,A very good overlooked movie.,9,2 March 2004,I remember when Dark City was released. The trailers and advertising never made me interested so up until now i wasn't that bothered. I had the opportunity to view it yesterday so i thought 'why not'. I was expecting a stupid twisted movie that made no sense but i was wrong. I found it very enjoyable from start to finish and yeah it was kind of twisted but not too twisted for me to dislike. Just enough twistiness for my liking. It is very similar to The Matrix so that has to be a good sign of its calibre. I would say it's like The Matrix without the kung fu action scenes and instead of machines ruling a fake world we have aliens instead. Dark City came and went very quietly back in 1998 which is good because it's not a mainstream film and wasn't meant to be and to be honest non-mainstream movies are more respectable because they don't care about what the majority of the audience thinks. A 'Watch it and if you enjoy it then so be it' attitude. What i'm saying is that is was made for the pure film making experience aspect of it and not mainly for the almighty dollar so it wouldn't appeal to the mass market therefore it wasn't diluted.  Dark City could have had a little more detail about the aliens themselves and what makes them tick but this is a pretty good movie. 9/10,Dark City

Even Keifer Sutherland (who is not my favorite actor) adds to this great movie. Unfortunately, this movie did not get the credit it deserved and only spent a couple of weeks in the theaters.  Somebody PLEASE re-release it.",Dark City
161,kellyadmirer,"Interesting Sci-fi, Nothing Special",6,9 December 2001,"I have been seeing raves about ""Dark City"" ever since it was released.  For some reason, it strikes a real chord with a certain demographic of society that tends to hang out on movie mailings lists and the like.  The same folks that love every single ""Star Trek"" film tend to rave about it. It's always nice to see a film find its audience.So, I finally saw the dvd (just the film, no commentary) last night.  I was neither impressed nor let down.  ""Dark City"" is a solid science fiction film that tells a dark (in several ways) tale with a fair degree of understatement.  I personally prefer such films.  I would rather see an unpretentious, low-key film that draws me in unexpectedly than catch the latest Julia Roberts all star extravaganza.  Different tastes for different folks.  Some people don't go for the whole ""subtlety"" bit.  I do.The most striking thing about the film is its look - which isn't particularly original.  It has a 1940s noirish feel to it.  Cross ""Blade Runner"" with ""Brazil"" and mix in a dose of ""Batman"" and you get the idea. Not particularly compelling after having seen it several times before, but very competently done.Our hero, Rufus Sewell, awakes in a strange room and finds his life is suddenly going to pieces.  Nothing is what he thought, everything is a mystery without clues.  It is your ""Twilight Zone"" standard plot #43.  You half expect him to wind up on the train to ""Willoughby.""  Nothing wrong with all that - but I've seen it before.  But, again, competently done.  It kept my interest, if not my rapt attention.""Dark City"" then devolves into your standard ""man must figure out what is going wrong with the world"" series of plot twists.  Does he solve the mystery?  Don't they always?  Does he put things right?  What do you think?I'm not down on the picture, it just isn't anything that special.  The striking Jennifer Connelly is completely wasted, as usual, though she gets a goodly amount of screen time and shows off her astonishing facial profile at every opportunity.  She does have a tendency to seem a bit blank at times, but as virtually the only female in the film, she is quite a sight for sore eyes.  I can't quite figure out how Rufus Sewell was cast in the lead, as he has trouble expressing the extremes of emotion that the character must be feeling.  Too bad he and William Hurt didn't swap roles.Hurt is the real bright spot, acting rings around everyone in sight (unlike in the previous year's ""Lost in Space,"" where he never really found the character of John Robinson, but more in keeping with 1983's brilliant ""Gorky Park"").  The rest of the characters provide good background filler, especially one particular creepy kid actor (who does a much better job than any of the young proto-actors in ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone""). 
Kiefer Sutherland does a fabulous job with his diction.  He has the William Shatner thing down cold.  Aside from Hurt, he is the only lead who really seems to inhabit his character.  He is one of those characters who you are never sure about, until the end.  If he were a little more of a physical presence here, he really would have shone on the dark city.  He plays the character as so overly cowed, though, even when he might not have to be, that he seems to recede into the shadows.  The character unnecessarily loses focus.  Missed it by ""that much,"" Kiefer. But for the Hurt character's Sam Spade gig, I'm left with the feeling that all I saw was an above-average SciFi Channel made-for-tv movie.  The fx were good (shape-shifting buildings) - but not particularly memorable.  Some visuals were quaint (the beach poster) - but hardly enough to build a film on.  The secret of the city was let out too early, blowing the suspense and forcing the film to rely on a hokey ""Masters of the Universe"" type of ending which consisted - I kid you not - of the good and bad guys glaring at each other.A nice film.  Worth a 6/10.  Not in the league of ""The Matrix,"" though.",Dark City
162,Manthorpe,"Similar ideas to The Matrix, except it's a very good film, as was here first.",9,14 January 2004,"How long have you been here? Are you really who you think you are? Have you always been this person, or is there something or someone else that your mind is struggling to remember? Does the sun ever even come out? Have I ever been outside the city? These are all questions the main characters ask themselves once their hero John Murdock realizes there's something amiss in their world and realizes nothing is as it seems. Where exactly are they? They're in Dark City. Tiny Spoilers:The city is ran by a dying alien race, called the Strangers, who have supremely superior technology and run the city as they see fit, keeping everyone asleep and oblivious to their surroundings and conducting secret experiments with the help of a traitor scientist, played by Kiefer Sutherland. But what they didn't expect was that one day, someone would wake up and start asking questions. Enter John Murdock.Dark City is one of my favorite science fiction movies and has undeniable similarities to the Matrix, just without the terrible acting and cheesy psychological babble. This movie has basically the same premise but is done without all of the action and money-grubbing sequels, and thankfully no Keanu or Fishburne. And also, unlike the Matrix movies, Dark City doesn't sit you down and explain everything to you and make you want to fall asleep. It calls on the viewer to actually think and figure things out for themselves. It seems more and more people these days are not willing to do that, which would explain the Matrix's overwhelming popularity, and this movie's slipping through the cracks. The camera work and lighting are excellent, giving the entire city a truly dark feeling, which is the entire point. All of the cars, building and clothes are from the '50s era which gives the movie and out of time sort of feel to it. The acting is also something to be admired as well, particularly Keifer Sutherland's role as Dr. Daniel Schreber, who is the only human who helps the Strangers. And Jennifer Connelly is super hot as usual, and gives a good performance as well. Rufus Sewell plays John Murdock perfectly and deserves some credit too, but he's not as hot. So, if you like the Matrix movies for their action and their so-called philosophical revelations that are thrown at you left and right, then you might have trouble wrapping your wet noodle around this one. However, if you can think on your own and actually contribute something to the evolution of mankind and the collective unconscious, then you should enjoy this film. Overall, 9/10.",Dark City
163,Gelaos,A noir movie just as I like it,9,18 September 2018,"Superb dark noir atmoshpere, shadows and neon lights, visual style of 1920-50's USA. Camera, actors, music, mystery, relationship of main couple - all crafted almost perfectly. And on top of that are charismatic and enigmatic Strangers.I was little disappointed with ending - everything was explained and there was too much action, I'd like more mysterious and calm ending.

164,krumski,It's true. It's all true.,7,21 March 2000,"I concur with every single positive comment made at this site concerning Dark City. It is an absolutely ingenious movie - certainly visually, but in Hollywood these days that's the easy part (even hack filmmakers can create movies that at least LOOK good); the real treat is how well the story fits together. It's gripping on the level of pure plot mechanics as a Kafkaesque nightmare, and it also works well on the philosophical level as a speculation upon the fundamental nature of identity. This latter part is somewhat undercut and ill-served by, IMO, a too abrupt finale which also falls back on typical Hollywood ""climactic showdown"" conventions; a more muted and ambiguous ending would have been preferable. Still, this is only a slight mar, and the picture is absolutely marvelous. It is often compared to Blade Runner and Brazil but, while I respect and appreciate both those movies, I found myself much more gripped and intrigued by Dark City.",Dark City
165,josenelias,"The film has some interest, but...",5,24 February 2020,"The film has some interest, as there is mystery and strangeness about what is going on with the story. The environment is also well accomplished with a mixture of eras, particularly from the 40s and 50s, but with the city looking like something like London. in the industrial revolution and always at night. There is a certain steampunk style always present.However, there are some things that don't flow very well in the film. The tics of the aliens are a little goofy and the part of the final confrontation is weak, looking like a poorly made and overacting Dragonball scene. There are a number of cartoonish things throughout the film that affect you.",Dark City
166,Funky A,Great potential ruined...,6,21 February 2000,"This movie looked so good... It's hard to believe someone could turn such a great idea into a pointless movie. The mood is very well set, the actors are good and some of the philosophical subjects are very interesting indeed, but the movie ends up being a weak science-fiction thriller with absolutely no twists nor any turns... The actions sequences are so bad and boring, it's hard to stay awake and the dialogues are often bad. The mood is well set, as I said earlier, but it's useless when the story is so boring. I don't like Alex Proyas(the director) because he makes movies that seem inspired by Tim Burton, but never have the fun factor of Burton's movies. He had very interesting ideas, but he made nothing to support them, just a nice-looking city, dark enough to make me remember the Gotham City Burton made. I don't hate this movie, I just think it could have been so much more. It had everything to make it a sci-fi classic like 2001, A Space Odyssey, but instead, it will be probably be remembered as a near-stroke-of-genius that could have been incredible... It is sad to think so many good ideas were wasted in that movie that finally goes to an ending that seems a bit rushed...6 out of 10... Too bad...",Dark City
167,KillerLord,Simply Marvellous!,10,6 October 2008,"In the genre of the those movies that deal with issues in Metaphysics, this is among the best movies I have ever seen. Alex Proyas proves himself to be a wonderful director assembling a cast and creating a world that simply is so captivating. The Matrix and Thirteenth Floor are two other movies that deal with similar issues. While Thirteenth Floor addresses more on the question of what can be considered to be real, the Matrix is more of an all round package addressing multiple questions, this movie Dark City beautifully drives a nail in the coffin of the concept of Tabula Rasa.Tabula Rasa means a blank slate. Many philosophers have proposed that we come into this world with our minds like a Tabula Rasa i.e. a blank slate on which the world writes down impressions. These impressions then define our personalities and eventually, our soul. The movie Dark City is about a race called Strangers who are manipulating the world in order to understand the human soul. They want to find out what is it that constitutes the soul and how it works. They've created a city which they change by telekinesis every midnight. They have a human doctor who is a psychiatrist with whose help they manipulate memories of individuals and study their behavior hoping to find the human soul or consciousness.The movie straight away jumps to the central character John Murdoch played wonderfully by Rufus Sewell. He finds himself a stranger to the world around him and just as we all do, he is compelled to investigate the nature of his world. He eventually discovers the startling truth that the world he lives in is but a manufactured one controlled by the strange beings known only as the Strangers. Soon, John discovers that he has their powers and can hence ensure that the world is free of them.The movie works wonderfully. It keeps you to the edge of your seats and makes you open your ears for scouting each and every word being said. And careful you should be, for a lapse in hearing or noticing something will cause the movie to become incomprehensible. The movie can best be summed by the following dialog said by John Murdoch : ""You were searching for the human soul but (pointing to his head), you were searching in the wrong place.""",Dark City

169,Tug-3,"Ominous, involving, and deep",9,30 April 1999,"*Dark City* is thrilling, dark, relentless, terrifying, stimulating.  It is one of the most involving science fiction films I have ever seen.  It borrows liberally from other sources, yes; but it combines these plundered elements into an original story that is surprising and frightening.Many folks have compared this far superior film to another very good science fiction movie, *The Matrix.*  Both movies share the same paranoid vision of a reality controlled by an outside, and possibly malevolent, force.  But whereas *The Matrix* uses the concrete reality we know and love as a reference point, *Dark City* gives us no such boundary.  Others have commented that the end of *Dark City* is unfulfilling, and they are right. But there is a reason *why* the end is unfulfilling: Proyas asks us questions about the nature of reality that are much too difficult to answer in the span of 2 hours.  This film asks questions about the malleability of humankind, the resonance of dreams, the power of the will, and the need for evolution.  These are philosophical questions it cannot answer, and wisely it does not try.The ""showdown"" at the climax of the film is not representative of a lack of creativity, as it is in so many other films.  We are almost fooled into thinking that conquering the Strangers will provide John with the key to solving his problems, but it does not.  We are left with the same nagging questions after the smoke has cleared from the highly-charged, brilliantly-conceived showdown: does reality exist?  Who dictates what form of reality we must embrace?  Will life improve now that the Strangers have been obliterated?*Dark City* is a film that forces us (or forced me, at least) to confront the terrible fear that life is but a nightmare.",Dark City
170,varundelpiero,A visual and intellectual masterpiece...,8,13 November 2008,"Is an individual nothing more than the sum of his/her memories? If you strip away these memories and replace them with others, does the person stop being himself/herself? These are some of the age-old questions that Alex Proyas seeks to examine in DARK CITY. If the name Alex Proyas seems familiar, it's because he was the man who brought us the fantastic story and cinematics in THE CROW. But don't go thinking that Proyas is just a one-hit wonder, because he takes some of the best elements from THE CROW and fuses it with profoundness and intellect, resulting in a magnificent Motion Picture in DARK CITY.The atmosphere and environment presented in DARK CITY are as engaging and as compelling as one will ever see in film. It grips you from the start and doesn't let go until the end credits roll. The viewer will feel totally immersed in Proyas' imagination and will become totally focused. And focus is important here because the viewer needs to pay careful attention to some of the little intricacies in this movie, in order to fully grasp the story. This is to say that this film is not just a visual feast devoid of substance. In a rare and delightful occurrence, viewers are treated not only to a visual cinematic feast, but one that will challenge them intellectually and perhaps emotionally.The acting is top-notch here, and Rufus Sewell was perfectly cast as the bewildered protagonist. Kiefer Sutherland is effective as the scientist, and Jennifer Connelly does adequately well. William Hurt has a small part in this film, and is as dependable and reliable as ever. But the real star here is Alex Proyas, as the story and the cinematography will rip you away from the real world and into his fantasy for the entire ~100 minute run-time of this feature. Admittedly, the story takes a while to develop and unravel its key points, but this may have been deliberate, and is an effective technique when it works. Take it from me: it works.This is simply a wonderful and fascinating Motion Picture by a truly visionary directory, incorporating not only the fantastic elements of THE CROW, but bringing to mind such features as THE TWILIGHT ZONE, VERTIGO, and even THE TRUMAN SHOW to name a few.This movie warrants a 9/10 rating and 3.5 stars (out of 4).

That distracted me. Couldn't she spend more time in front of the mirror next time?I didn't like the slow ending with too much revealing special effects (I rather didn't see the total shots of the city in space, that ruined the 'reality' for me.Also a bit far fetched to see a dying alien species going through all the trouble of experimenting with us.

This film is burdened with one of the most trite stories I've ever had the misfortune to have to sit through.  Well, I didn't HAVE to sit through it, of course, but I kept hoping it would get better.  Instead, it got worse.

Only 20 minutes had passed by ! At this rate it was going to feel like 24 hours before I got to the end. So I'll confess: I accelerated the action. I might have missed a few plot points, but it didn't seem to matter much. Many of the visuals were rather amazing, but they, too, grew repetitive, and I wasn't at all sure what they were meant to be telling me. Also, there were vast crowds of zombies from another world, like things from outer space, hanging around. I could tell they wanted something, but I wasn't sure what. Was it Get A Life ? Aw, yeah, they wanted our planet. I seem to remember that plot from another film, long ago. Was it called The Bodysnatchers from Another World? War of the Worlds? Mars Attacks? Seems to me this story has been done to death. Some SF is brilliant: Bladerunner, Back to the Future, Terminator etc. Other SF is schlock and dreck.

174,neon47,Akira meets the first Matrix.,8,13 July 2006,"Dark City holds the ideas of a great innovative sci-fi that could've been a masterpiece for its time. Unfortunately the movie falls short in a few areas making it a mostly decent sci-fi. The first 10min of the movie give us the monologue of a traitor and the awakening of the main character, John Murdoch. John has no idea who he is or where he is, all he knows is that there's a dead call girl in his room and it's time for him to split. Don't let this mislead you into thinking the entire movie is fast paced, truth is, it's just as ""stop-go"" as a Penzoil commercial. The Strangers however, the group hunting John, are a harrowing race of people that you'd think would appear in a Marylin Manson video. The Strangers have the ability to ""tune"" which allows them to alter reality around them. Unfortunately they don't use their powers too often to try and stop John. Watching this only kept reminding me of the mysteries of the first Matrix movie and the anime masterpiece Akria in which the character Tetsuo tapped into his psychic powers. If you've seen both Akria and the Matrix you'll likely enjoy Dark City, if you haven't I suggest checking out those before you see this.",Dark City
175,keihan,A valentine to German Expressionism...,8,18 February 2000,"The classics that everybody talks about years down the road are, most often than not, not recognized as such when first released. Citizen Kane wound up getting knocked out by William Randolph Hearst and a public too content with happy endings to accept this bitter vision. Wizard of Oz didn't become a bonafide hit until it hit television in the 1960's. Night of the Hunter (one of the scariest films of all time in my opinion) was a complete financial disaster for first-time director Charles Laughton. So it does not suprise me overly much that Dark City has gotten similarly, unjustified, downright shabby treatment from most critics and the audiences.At first, I thought Dark City ""a Metropolis for the '90s"". Then I thought that it could be seen as a cross between the aforementioned Fritz Lang masterpiece and his first sound film, M. Now, after several late-night viewings (which for the right effect, I began playing the tape just before dawn, giving my surroundings the right atmospheric touch), I have concluded that it is a valentine to the whole German Expressionist movement: Lang, Murnau, Pabst, Freund. Though I also see it as a precursor to The Matrix (another excellent film to which one could trace its roots back to Metropolis), I also think that, had this been made in the silent era, it would have fit right in.First there's the city itself. Only too obvious that it was inspired by Metropolis, where its inhabitants run on a rigid schedule of unbreakable monotony. But instead of just being factory workers in the guts of a great machine, they're pawns on a chessboard, with the Strangers removing and placing them as they please. The Strangers, again obviously, are inspired primarily by Clive Barker's Cenobites, but Mr. Hand's look is actually more inspired by that of Count Orlok in Nosferatu, right down to the collar. Compare the scene where John Murdoch holds the knife to Hand's face with a close-up of Orlok and you can see that the only thing missing is the distinctive bushy eyebrows. Dr. Paul Daniel Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland), a pathetic, twisted, little gnome of a man, recalls not only some of father Donald's more off-beat roles, but also Peter Lorre's turns as complicated villain (most notably in M and Mad Love). The lisp didn't bother me so much, as I reasoned that it might have been a result of his obvious deformities. One of the film's most interesting twists is how this complex character plays a part in the endgame. Finally, there's the names of the main characters themselves. Consider: Murdoch, Schreber, Bumstead, Walinsky. All of them Germanic in origin. One could not make the connection between German Expressionism and this film more obvious.Some decades from now, I believe that this film will be recognized for the instant classic it is. Mark my words.",Dark City
176,Yiannis_Galidakis,"Dark, twisted, depressing but excellent",10,29 September 2020,"The underlying idea connects wildly with many areas in sci.fi horror. Starting with L. Ron Hubbard's scientology, where we are just hosts to soul parasites - ""thetans"", to possesive demonic spirits or under the sleeping influence of some greater malevolent source, like the Demiurge in Gnosticism or the Architect in The Matrix series. It's of course no coincidence that this has been released one year before the Matrix (1999) as the latter is essentially a saturated version of it, with added Kung-fu hoopla and special effects. The central idea is just something entirely horrible: That we are basically of unknown origin being herded for food or some other nefarious purpose, for reasons unknown. The reason here is a little silly (trying to figure the ""soul"" of humans), but the overall idea works and scares the living daylights out of the viewer. All the little excruciating details which mimick roughly a 1968 city, from cars and buildings add to the horror and confusion. How the heck did these ""strangers"" get all this replication information? Where from? Where do THEY come from? Nobody knows and it's best that the film leaves it at that. Much better effect to not knowing some core issues, than having ridiculous pseudo-scientific explanations with aliens hundreds of light years away. Everybody is in the big sleep. And then, suddently, a call: ""Wake UP!"" Wake up so you can fall asleep AGAIN, under the auspices of an invisible malevolent force that during your sleep, by manipulating your pineal gland, changes your reality to something else. Whenever the pineal gland is involved I freak out. Something strange about that gland. Theosophy associates this gland with hypnotism and many pseudo-scientific alternative practices claim that as you age, it calcifies and you gradually lose contact with important spiritual stimuli. Proyas takes this to another dimension: Displays a specimen, which by evolution has managed to utilize this gland to manipulate matter to his satisfaction. No wonder a psychologist is involved, who is probably the most tragic and depressing of all characters in the movie. The only one who ""knows"" what's going on. Roughly, that is, because the main idea remains unresolved. The confusion of the populous, is similar to the confusion from sleep and dreams or from reincarnation after losing all your old memories and starting from scratch, only with manufactured memories. The transferred undertones of the story have some scary unintended consequences: Are we, here on Earth in a similar situation? What if we are? Can we do anything about it? What if we can't? The issue has been plaguing humanity, since at least the 15-th century, when Descartes addressed it with his Evil Genius/Malevolent God scenario. It has been unresolved ever since. Great food for thought for Gnostics, conspiracy theorists and flat Earth believers. Jennifer Connely at her best.

177,jmverville,Poor Example of a Poor Style of Film,4,14 December 2004,"As far as 'interesting,' 'intriguing,' and 'mysterious' go this film seemed to miss them all. It attempted to be mysterious by making up bizarre occurrences along the way, culminating in, essentially, nothing.It was more of a glorification of one, single, solitary human character who, for some unknown reason, was chosen by fate (seemingly) to bring down an evil system that you progressively learn more and more about throughout the course of a film. For a style of film, it is not a very good style; and for execution of this style, it is not a very good film. It is often overly dark and cold without any purpose. It is often an exercise in futility by Proyas to get the viewer to feel something. People consider it philosophical, deep, thrilling, etc. but I find it to be none of the above. Occasionally, a film that is pretty to look at, it is just one of the poorer examples of its genre: a parade of dark-looking figures in a gloomy world with the hope of humanity hinged on a man endowed with special abilities. Naturally, I do not have to tell you how the film ends for you to accurately predict it. And naturally, I do not have to hint at how overdone of a genre it is, and how disappointing it is when push comes to shove. You will find that this film is long-winded and tries to be psychological & philosophical but would only convince me that Mr. Proyas is not a very good director.

178,NicolasCostoglou,First there was darkness...then came Dark City...,10,16 December 2016,"Dark City is one of the greatest cinematic gems ever made, incredibly original, creative, philosophical and thought-provoking.The visuals are beyond amazing and it's safe to say that this is at least the most beautiful movie of the 90's. The cinematography, goes hand in hand with the strange set-design, and the gloomy lighting. You can pause nearly every second of this film, take a picture and pin it to your wall...But it's not just the look, it's also the content that's amazing, Dark City tells a story about...well i don't wanna spoiler that, you have to watch it.I mean it's worth your time for Trevor Jones incredible soundtrack alone, every piece of music in this film is great and fits the style perfectly (even Trevor Jones seems to have the own opinion that this is his greatest work, or why did he copied nearly every track for the movie Desperate Measures?) Even the editing has something special, mostly at the start of the film, there is a cut nearly every two seconds, but it's not too fast, it's so that we feel as if we where in the same situation as our protagonist.The characters are also very good, which has to be expected in a movie with that kind of theme. Rufus Sewell is great, same for Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt and especially Richard o'Brien (wo's voice and movement are incredible) and Kiefer Sutherland in his best role to date, i forget nearly every time that he is Dr. Paul Schreber, that's how good he is.I always say people who never heard of this film, to imagine a mosaic, and you get one little stone at a time until it's complete and you finally understand what's going on, because there is one picture in this film near the conclusion in which everyone knows what i'm talking about...I could talk way more about this incredible gem and i love it since i saw it the first time.But before i finish my thoughts here's a little tip, if you have the chance to see the director's cut, watch that version, it's not THAT different from the theatrical release, but it never tries to hold you hand. (There is a monologue at the beginning of the theatrical cu, which tells you a few things that are way more effective when you have no idea what's going on at all) I love Dark City, and everyone who thinks that Matrix, or Inception (which i also like) are the smartest movies ever made, than they haven't seen this one...",Dark City
179,Akira-36,In the eyes of an amateur movie-lover...,7,24 December 2001,"there's not much of a deep analysis I can present, except of the understanding of all of the relations and influences of classic sci-fi and noir films of the old, upon Dark City. In fact I almost fell asleep while watching it the first time, on the big screen. But there was something in the movie that made me wanted to see it twice. I did, several months later on VCD format.It's the darkness that envelops the entire city, the loneliness felt by the characters, the uncertainties of their surroundings. The settings, ligthing, costume and mystery. But mostly it is because of the movie's multi-layered symbolism. We see something in each of that layer. I can relate with John's confusion and identity-crisis. Waking up in a imaginary land, where ominous beings are chasing you, a beautiful yet estranged lady with long dark hair, the stench of the pipes' smokes, the spiral into oblivion, aren't these the stuff of dreams/nightmares?There is something that is almost sub-conscious about the movie. It could mean anything to different people. For me, I too share John's confusion and struggle to retain his false memories. In the end what matters is your own conception of the truth. After the realization of John's and the dark city's true nature, he finds the courage to fight back the ominous beings who control and rule the cityscape. They are perhaps the embodiment of our own society's puppeteers: soulless aliens trying to understand, but could never have, the soul. John finally finds the courage and strength to shape a reality of his own. Afterall the truth is only as real as the mind's eye choose to perceive. The rest is but a fabrication of random occurances and coincidences. Strangely enough, that is what I 'feel' by watching Dark City. It is a personal inner journey from a dark spiral of endless flight, to the realization of the truth, making your stand and walking that narrow alley to earn your prize: a brightly-lit oceanscape of fresh air and a beautiful woman by your side. Finding peace and enlightenment.PS: Rufus Sewell plays with excellent subtlety, with captivating performances from the rest of the actors/actresses.",Dark City

This is more than what's available to do technically ~ it's a vision.The look and feel is one part Serling, one part Huston, one part Gilliam, one part Hitch, one part Kubrick, one part Lynch, one part Cronenberg and a few Barkers thrown in for good measure.Roundly excellent performances [even from the lovely but generally non-descript Connelly] and an utterly original story.I'll watch this again and again ~ and likely shake my head in wonder as many times as I did upon my first viewing.4 Niro~stars of 4.",Dark City

182,machngunjoe,Dark City and Director cut review,10,1 August 2010,"A great Sci-fi flick by any standards.Like many great Sci-Fi epic movies you will not find invading aliens or a big monster to kill in this movie. Great Science Fiction is usually based off great ideas.This movie has an original premise and is simply a great scary movie w/o the monster stuff or bloody axe murderer slowly walking down the hallway. In Fact, as far a cliché's go, this movie intentionally inserts many cliché's from different genres as part of the plot.I originally saw the theatrical release, then bought it, then saw the director's cut recently.I must say for me; for which one was better, I could say there is so little difference in the two versions it won't make a big difference. I would also say, see the theatrical first because, contrary to what the director believes in his commentary, the prologue in the beginning is a good insert for grabbing the audiences attention and sucking them into the Dark City mythology. Plus, there are also technical foul ups in the directors cut, such as some bad ADR, that wasn't in the first release, extended sequences that don't serve a real purpose in character development, (I'm thinking of the extended scene where Jennifer Connely's character sings an entire song in the Director's Cut as opposed to a short sequence in the theatrical release. Anyways is a great thinking movie with all the good Sci-Fi horror feelings you would normally get. A cult classic for sure, and for movie collectors; get this one and show it to your vulnerable friends during Halloween like I do... Cheers.",Dark City
183,Falcon-51,Descent Film-Noir & Sci-Fi Flick,7,3 June 2000,"""Dark City"" is a good example of what good special effects can do for a movie. Still there is so much more this film could have accomplished. The story was a bit confusing and when things started to clear up towards the end there was still a lot of unanswered questions. A more well defined story could have helped. Let me give an example using two more popular films. Take ""Godzilla"" and ""Jurassic Park"" both featured great F/X but only the latter had a strong exciting story. Now granted ""Jurassic Park"" & ""Godzilla"" were aimed at a younger audience, but then take ""The Matrix"" into account. Here is a film with strong appeal to adults, great special effects, and an exciting story. Still I give ""Dark City"" above average marks for descent acting and originality. William Hurt was delightful as always and Kiefer Sutherland who is one of my favorite actors does a good job as the mad scientist although anyone could have probably played the part. I'm still glad it was him though.The story is about a guy named John Murdoch (Sewell) that awakens in a bathtub with very little memory and soon finds he is being sought for murder. In his attempts to escape he learns about some strange beings that control the dark world he is living in and finds that they posses great power. In time Murdoch finds he has some surprises of his own. Frank Bumstead (Hurt) is the inspector that captures Murdoch and thereafter realized that there are some strange things happening. Dr. Schreber (Sutherland) is a some what unwilling pawn of the menace known only as the Strangers. A definite for Film-Noir & Sci-Fi buffs.",Dark City
184,CWP-,A brilliantly-conceived and intelligent visual masterpiece,9,6 July 1999,"My age: 13John Murdoch, played by Rufus Sewell, awakens in a bathtub in a hotel room, not remembering anything about his past and discovering that he is wanted for a series of brutal murders.  He receives a phone call from Dr Schreber, played by Kiefer Sutherland, who wishes to help him, and leaves the hotel. He begins to have memories of Shell Beach from a postcard in his suitcase. He has no idea what is going on in the dark city.  The strangers are another species who live under the ground and search for the human soul.  The strangers have the ability to tune, to cloud people's minds and make them sleep.  John finds that he is the only person who can resist this power and use it himself.  Every night the strangers put the whole town to sleep, imprint people with new memories and change the appearance of the city. Detective Bumstead, played by William Hurt, is on the murder case, trying to bring John in, but is then caught up in helping John uncover the truth.This film is visually excellent, especially during the scenes when the strangers are changing the city.  I look forward to future work by the director Alex Proyas, whose directing style is brilliant in this film. Acting performances are very good, and the film has an interesting and intriguing plot.  The characters are well thought up, and you really care about them.  The film is great from start to finish, but the film is best in the end, with a showdown between the main stranger and John.

185,octopusluke,Unoriginal sci-fi at it's bodacious best,8,23 November 2012,"Alex Proyas' Dark City has been left lurking in the shadows as the unwelcome older brother of the Wachowski's definitive high-concept sci-fi action movie, The Matrix. A truly visionary movie, fourteen years on from it's initial release date, it stand the test of time as one of the best forays into technological dystopia since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, even if the film is almost entirely unoriginal.The titular city is an anachronistic metropolis that instantly wreaks of Tim Burton's Gotham in the early Batman movies. Dark City never sees daylight, and is populated by citizens who are brought to collective unconscious when the clock strikes midnight every evening. One of the more curious inhabitants is John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who wakes up soaking in a hotel room bathtub with no memory of who he is or how he got there after a scientific experiment gone wrong. He gets a call from the exasperated psychiatrist Daniel Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) urging John to put on some clothes and get the hell out of there before 'The Strangers' (a klan of of ghostly figures (led by the perfectly cast Richard O'Brien) hunt him down.Stumbling through the skyscraper city trying to piece together the remnants of his life, he realises that he is man on the run not only from these omniscient overlords, but his estranged wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) and the grizzled Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) who believe him to be a murderer. Desperate to prove his innocence for the sake of the law, and to remember his own shady identity, things turn even more beguiling for John when 'The Strangers' reveal themselves to be intergalactic spirits manipulating the lives of the city dwellers whilst they sleep, and he is the only person in the universe who has the power to stop them.Clocking in at 100 minutes, it's remarkable how much thematic bulk director/co- writer/producer Alex Proyas is able to cram into Dark City. Even more extraordinary is his ability for it all to coalesce so well. Hurt is appropriately austere as the unflinching gumshoe detective from another time period, Connelly oozes with femme fatale sex appeal as a lounge bar singer led astray, Sewell plays the mystery man with refreshing, Kafka-esque existential crisis and, best of all, Richard O'Brien is so fervently eerie as the dark visitor haunting his shrouded memories. If there's any weak link amongst the acting calibre, it's Sutherland's turn as a jittery scientist, so overwhelmed by his intelligence that he is unable to string a coherent sentence together.For all it's masterful cinematography from Dariusz Wolski (the same man behind the photography of Ridley Scott's Prometheus), plus the brilliant, electro-orchestral fusion score from Trevor Jones, Alex Proyas' Dark City is built on well-worn pastiches. Aside from the coincidental atmospheric likeness to The Matrix, there's the hypnagogic absurdity of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, the autonomous footworkers familiar in Fritz Lang's Metropolis (plus a big face in the architecture too). Thrown in next is the threats of capitalism akin to Alan Moore's graphic novel series Watchmen, and lastly the hardboiled detective and chiaroscuro city streets, both derivative of just about every decent film noir, from Hitchcock's Rebecca to the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple. Lacking the visual ingenuity of his über-violent predecessor The Crow (one of my favourite action movies ever), I couldn't help but be constantly gripped and excited by Proyas' fantastical bric-a-brac world.Even with some undernourished plot twists, it's sci-fi filmmaking at it's bodacious best. Yes – alternate worlds, alien overlords and Kiefer Sutherland are ridiculous things, but if you take a visit to Alex Proyas' Dark City, you'll never want to leave.",Dark City
186,andrew7,"Rich, rewarding film",10,26 April 2002,"This film is as layered and as deep as you want it to be.  If you're just looking for an exciting sf film with aliens, special effects, and a little nudity thrown in for good measure, this is it.  But, if you care to delve a little deeper, there's a lot to explore here. The principle theme is the link, if any, between memory and identity.  All of the characters in this film had lives before the film began.  But, they have no memory of those lives, and they have no real connection with those lives.  The people who they now think that they are may have nothing whatsoever in common with who they ""really"" are (or, perhaps more accurately, who they ""originally"" were).  Consider John Murdoch.  We've got here your typical action hero with no memory.  He doesn't know he's an action hero, he doesn't know his name is John Murdoch (he deduces it).  He is carried along by events, pursued by multiple quarters, has friends he can't remember and can't trust, and begins putting together the pieces of a vast mystery.  Eventually, he discovers his true powers and decides to take an active role in the proceedings.  Standard sf/action plot (and, based on the trailers, it looks like ""The Bourne Identity"" will run along similar lines).  Of course, as others have noted, it bears a certain similarity to ""The Matrix"", which is a tour de force of incredible special effects, great fight scenes, and truly horrible acting in service of a shoddy, predictable, and poorly structured script.But anyway, look beyond that and consider the issues involved.  Is John Murdoch a murderer?  Consider the question ""Who is John Murdoch?""  John Murdoch is not a ""real"" person with a ""real"" history.  He is a fiction.  He was created by the Strangers as part of their macabre experiment.  According to the Strangers' plan, he is a murderer.  Therefore, yes, John Murdoch is a murderer.  He caught his wife cheating on him, and snapped, and went out on a rampage killing prostitutes  (and seriously, isn't that exactly what you would do?... uh, well, nevermind). But then, is the character portrayed by Rufus Sewell a murderer?  Seems not. He's very disturbed early in the film as he begins to find the evidence that suggests that he killed those prostitutes.  He doesn't want to kill prostitutes, has no reason to kill prostitutes, and is very upset at the thought that he may have killed prostitutes.  Which leads to the inescapable conclusion that the character portrayed throughout this film by Rufus Sewell is not John Murdoch (though he does have fragments of Murdoch's memories). In fact, in a fascinating twist, John Murdoch ends up being played by Richard O'Brien, which confirms for us, if any confirmation is needed, that Murdoch is a murderer.   What the film seems to suggest, and it's an unappealing idea, is that identity and memory are precisely the same thing.  Mr. Hand becomes John Murdoch when he acquires the memories of John Murdoch.  Rufus Sewell's character is not John Murdoch because he does not have those memories. 
So we reach the conclusion of the film, where we have the primary philosophical dispute between this film and The Matrix.  Sewell's character has defeated the Strangers by appropriating their power, and not stands God-like over their abandoned city.  He reshapes it according to his own desires.  Presumably, with all of his powers, he'd be able to return himself and everyone else to Earth (from whence, presumably, they had been abducted).  But he chooses a pleasing fiction over an uncertain reality. This is precisely the choice of Joe Pantoliano's character in The Matrix (and, because his character is a ""villain"" betraying the heroes, the audience understands this to be the wrong choice).  So, The Matrix values truth above experience.  Between to alternatives, one good and one bad, the one which corresponds to truth is preferred.  The truth-value of the situation trumps whatever other value is concerned.  But in Dark City, the truth value is irrelevant.  John Murdoch (and now, finally, Sewell is John Murdoch, but a new Murdoch created by Dr.  Schreber, not a murderer, but with many of the same core memories, such as Shell Beach and Uncle Karl) freely chooses a life which he knows to be false (because he created it). 
I've always said that Joe Pantoliano's character was the only intelligent character in The Matrix.  I stand by that.  He was wrong to betray his friends, yes, but he was right in recognizing that ignorance is bliss.  This film shows us that fact clearly.  It's also a terrific story, well-acted, marvelously directed, with incredible sets, stunning visuals, and a quick pace that never lags.",Dark City

I think it belongs with Blade Runner and 12 Monkees to name a couple of others in a similar vein. I can only guess it was the casting of Rufus Sewell - a then unknown Aussie actor - in the lead role. On the contrary, he is rock solid and owns the role of the confused yet curious protagonist who looks to recovery his memory while trying to solve the murders of which he has been accused. All the while being tracked by the Strangers - a collective of strange ""men"" that are able to transform the physical world they inhabit. The supporting cast is amazing. WIlliam Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, Kiefer Sutherland and Melissa George among them and all own their roles with aplomb.

It's something of an underrated gem that has gained cult status in recent years, mostly due to its connection to The Matrix. The film, depending on what version you watch, maintains ambiguity till the end and slowly gives you answers. This isn't an action film like its bigger and more commercially successful brother (The Matrix), it's a neo-noir that has many tropes of the genre. Dark City is also a visually stunning film with moody lighting, detailed sets and fantastic model work. The performances the main actors give excellently convey that sense of cluelessness.If you're a fan of The Matrix, this is also a film you need to see because not only do they have similar plots, they also retain some of the same sets. Both were filmed in Fox studios in Sydney during the late 90's so there's lots of speculation what film's idea was first. This is not to say The Matrix is inferior, it's one of the best action movies of that decade or heck of all time. Although I do think Dark City deals with its themes of reality more thoroughly. Essentially I think the first thirty minutes of The Matrix are the whole of Dark City.I had the privilege of seeing this in the theatre in its original 35mm print and I have to say it looked absolutely incredible.

192,ufo0001,Feels like the Matrix somehow,10,2 May 2002,"Pros: Special effects, score, directing, script, sets.Cons: Kiefer sutherland, feels a bit rushed.Dark City by Alex Proyas is one of the best sc-fi films of the nineties. Rufus Sewell plays a murderer (or not) who can remember anything about his life except Shell Beach, where he grew up from. He discovers that he has an unusual gift and at midnight, everyone seems to fall asleep. This film is similar to the matrix because like the matrix the humans here are slaves and unaware to thier prison. But unlike the matrix, the mood is darker (always at night except at the end) and it plays like a film noir. One would say it is almost like the Thirteenth Floor, another excellent sci-fi film. The themes explored in Dark City are the same ones explored in BLADE RUNNER, what makes us human?. The alien race are very scary in thier appearance especially the kid whose only line is ""Kill him"". Jennifer Conelly plays Sewell's love interest and William Hurt plays a cop after Rufus Sewell. Kiefer Sutherland plays a pyschiatrist who works for the alien race and wants to help Sewell develop his gift. The twist at the end is one of the most scary in recent years and only matched by the Sixth Sense.Premise: Rufus Sewell must find out who is chasing him, why he is wanted for murders, why he cannot remember anything and what's the deal with Shell Beach.Dark City was not nominated for any Academy awards but won the Saturn award for best science fiction movie.Grade: 10/10 (A sci-fi classic).",Dark City

Anyways the movie is packed tightly and never bores. It will keep you guessing and that's the nature of the plot. Ya during the last half an hour you might feel like things are going too much illogical and that's where it bends down a level.

196,timefreezer7,Impressive mix of a fantasy film and a psychological thriller,8,18 May 2002,"Although the basic plot seems nothing more than a typical twilight zonish subject expanded to a 90 minutes time slot Alex Proyas succeeds in the narration of this strange story . His assistant technicians should take the credit for pulling off this never-boring-for-the-viewer movie with their decent art direction and dark cinematography  .I will begin by saying that CAUTION : this is NOT an action film . If you except the fact that our lead John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) is constantly on the run to escape from his pursuers , there are no bombs , gunfire etc etc . If you want to see a typical sci fi  adrenaline-packed blockbuster see the ""Matrix"" . AHHH! Here we come to the point . This atmospheric predecessor of the Matrix proved that you don 't need gratuitous action scenes with kung fu and corny acrobatic SFX to keep the audience 's attention ( however I would like to point out that it is unfair to say the Wachowski Bros ripped off Dark City because drafts of the script existed ever since 1996) . Anyway Dark City starts off as a psychological thriller . John Murdoch has a strange kind of amnesia . He can 't remember who he is , he is wanted for a murder he can 't recall committing , he has a wife who doesn 't recognize (played by Jennifer Connelly) and he has an unexplained desire to visit a place from his supposed childhood (Shell Beach) .From the beginning though it becomes clear that we are watching a fantasy film with supernatural forces . I won 't say more however in order not to spoil the fun . The similarities between Matrix and Dark City are evident (3 leading characters , the pursuers/baddies , a massive hallucination) . But whereas Matrix was an IMPUDENT ripoff from Star Wars , Terminator and Nightmare on Elm Street mish-mashed with pseudo religious hints , Dark City can stand on its own thanks to the imaginative direction and mostly due to the mystery factor which keeps the viewer hooked until the end . (no need for ""cool"" rayban glasses or black capes) . Of course this doesn 't mean that the Proyas film isn 't inspired from other films . Dark City deals with the question ""what makes us human"" and is slightly reminiscent of Blade Runner . Personally I believe that Dark City answered the question much better than the 1982 film (no need for slow pace and foggy frames here as well!) . The prophecy about the ONE who is going to save man kind seems to be taken by Dune ( I am not saying Star Wars because we don 't have the plot device mentor-training-student ) . There are also some plot elements which I can 't give away but I will say that reminded me a little bit of ""Close Encounters of the 3rd type"" , ""The Shadow"" with Alec Baldwin and the villains seem to be cousins of Uncle Fester from the Addams Family .The art direction seems to be an amalgam from Gotham City(the most famous in-joke about Batman finally materializes : a city which never sees the daylight!!!) and 1920 's Detroit fashion : the cars , costumes and hats (the barber shop reminded me of the Untouchables) . The edition is nice with the flashbacks popping out here and there , the cinematography is beautiful (especially in all scenes near or on the river) but I believe the SFX needed a bit reworking . Anyway there are a couple of sequences you will never forget and the narration has the nice amount of mystery , action and suspense . Rufus Sewell performs a difficult task . Despite his plain looks and unattractive characteristics he gives a likeable character who struggles to save his life and memories in a messy environment. No real star power or bulged body or handsome face (Harrison Ford anyone ?). If the film was more mainstream we would have a Bruce Willis or Brad Pitt in the role . Unfortunately one of the liabilities is that Mr Sewell carries the film exclusively on his shoulders . William Hurt seems as a forced-in decorative role with no real purpose . I liked seeing Jennifer Connelly who was lost after the amazing Labyrinth back in 1986 , but unfortunately she isn 't given much to do . Both Connelly and Hurt are wasted and end up as nothing more than extended cameos . The actors behind the villains could have been interesting if we could tell them apart !!! The only supporting actor I found interesting was that strange cop and I hated seeing him vanish so quickly . Finally Kiefer Sutherland : his dyslexic character is obviously inspired by Mouse , the retarded blond adolescent who lived at the underground society in TV 's Beauty and the Beast with Linda Hammilton . Sutherland is sometimes irritating with the way he talks although he has the key role . (at least the plot twist was ingenious) .Enough said I think . If you want to see an independent production , entertaining and simultaneously thought-provoking see Dark City . To its credit this is a short film obviously not wanting to have unnecessary interludes of action to fill in the screen time . It is the good way of telling an inventive fantasy story without being a boring flagging depiction of a one dimensional gimmick (cough , cough , Gattaca , cough , cough ) . Oh , and before I forget my hat off to Alex Proyas for delivering a much better film than the Crow .8.5 / 10",Dark City
197,Mash-the-stampede,The blue pill????,8,22 September 2009,"'Dark City' is a dark (well obviously), psychotic, science fiction-noir, mystery which never let's up on the twists and keeps you guessing right from the beginning to the conclusion which still may leave you wanting more answers.Poor advertising and mis-understanding of the film by the studios meant the film got sold as a ""horror"" film and not as a intellectual sci-fi thriller which resulted in it's flop at the Box-office with young teens heading in to theater's expecting horror and coming out confused and sci-fi enthusiasts totally missing it as it unfortunately didn't blip on their radars.Fortunetly the film found it's audience on DVD and is now considered a cult-classic of ""The Matrix"" variety even though the film was released in theater's a full year before anyone even new what the Matrix was! I am not going to discuss the plot in any detail at all as I believe the less you know about this film, the better but I will say AVOID the theatrical version if possible and rent or purchase The Director's cut as it is a much better and fuller film than the theatrical cut which pretty much explains the story in a voice over at the beginning of the film just so that all the viewers without brains and who don't want to be taken on a journey of mystery and intrigue will better understand that what they are watching is indeed a movie!

198,kikoydaba3,A masterpiece in visual storytelling,10,20 October 2019,"A masterpiece in production design, cinematography, and score, Dark City is a throwback to early 20th century period, tribute to film noir and German Expressionistic films such as Metropolis. Unapologetically bleak but with an undercurrent of hope and love, the film is a deep dive into themes of reality, memories, and perception. What the film lacks in action, it has in spades of character study. The sense of time and space are further manipulated to present a grand scale in a once small and contained story centering on an amnesiac man running from shadowy figures.The story follows John Murdoch as he awakens in a bathtub, suffering from amnesia. With only faint memories of his past, Murdoch is chased by groups of men called ""Strangers"", upon the call of Dr. Daniel Schreber, who seeks the ""tuning"" ability he possesses. Emma Murdoch is his wife, whom he has no recollection. Aside from the Strangers, Inspector Frank Bumstead is hot on his trail because Murdoch is accused of murder, one of which is a dead woman found inside the apartment he woke up. The pursuit ensues unwrapping mysteries behind the Strangers, Murdoch's fabricated past and the city's façade. The Strangers are a group of extraterrestrials near extinction who seek the meaning of humanity's individuality as a means to save their race. Every people living in the city is an unwitting subject, Murdoch included. All memories of the past are fabrications made by the Strangers meant to cloak changes. The city is the apparatus in which this giant experiment unfolds. During midnight the city physically changes, literally. Buildings and roads are rearranged and new memories are inserted to erase every truthful past and recollection. The city, in reality, is a massive space habitat protected by force fields, at the core of which is a machine that powers the city's machinations and is the Strangers home.What is reality? Is the world a façade? Is reality ultimately a subjective viewpoint? What drives our perception of reality? How do our memories shape our present self? Dark City answers these philosophical questions satisfyingly and in a cathartic fashion.Reality in Dark City can be viewed from multiple perspectives. The city is real from the Strangers' standpoint since they are its builders. Having control is tangible power, and is real because it alters the city's true state. For Murdoch, reality begins confusingly due to amnesia but the ending with Anna, Emma's new identity, is his true reality. Emma is the wife he never had, except as implanted memories, but this is where he builds his reality. The city can be further considered a façade or not depending on the perspective. The Strangers built a façade world where the occupants consider it real.Now, is reality ultimately a subjective viewpoint? In the film's context, reality is indeed subjective. On a personal level, we create our own reality through our identities and experiences. The physical world is a reality different from the mental reality each individual possesses. It is a stimulant which our physical bodies are subjected. Some reactions are natural like pain, but emotions may vary from person to person, thus each may conclude differently from the same source. Murdoch, as the central character, finds resolution when after defeating the Strangers he altered reality to his will by changing the city into the memories which were implanted. Emma, now Anna with new memories, is his only reality because everything is mere creation and the only person whom he feels an emotion and love towards is her. Ultimately, as the driving force of the film his resolution is the thread that binds the themes together.The acting is also great. Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, and Kiefer Sutherland are good in their roles, but Jennifer Connelly is the best performer, embodying the pain of not knowing any true past.21 years since Dark City's release the visuals remain something to behold. The artistic qualities need to be experienced first-hand because words are not enough to do justice its beauty. A masterpiece in art direction and cinematography.10/10",Dark City
199,benjaminwg,"A near masterpiece, with my original theater viewing being one of the two greatest film experiences of my life",10,24 December 2018,"When I originally saw this in '98 the first week it was out, I knew nothing about what to expect. As chance would have it, I was late to the theater and didn't get into the auditorium until just as we're moving in on the giant clock. I did not hear the opening studio-imposed narration or see anything prior to that clock. This not-quite-actually-existent version of the film I'd rate as unquestionably up there among the greatest films of all time. It was such a profound experience that for many years I refused to watch it on a smaller screen in digital and only finally did so on a top-of-the-line setup I knew was capable of actually some semblance of the dynamic range Proyas intended. That's a long time with only a memory of a single film viewing. I've heard people having that sort of inability to bring themselves to watch Lawrence of Arabia on anything but 70mm projection. Dark City was sort of my Lawrence of Arabia. These subsequent much later viewings of Dark City, though not quite up to the film viewing, surprisingly had a similar emotional impact on me as the original. There is only one other film that had such an effect on me on the big screen that I hesitated to see it on the small screen later, but that one I still refuse to re-watch.However, the director's cut of Dark City adds too much footage beyond just getting rid of that idiotic opening spoiler. The extended row boat scene now is far too long and spoils even more than the original opening did. The ultimate reveal is later.
The theatrical cut's efficiency in editing also worked slightly better than what people are now calling the ""slow burn"" of the extended takes and painstaking match-cuts in the director's version. Some of the extended takes and improved match-cuts do add some lucidity to it, are appreciated, and aren't harmful, but clearly the rhythm and flow of the theatrical cut was not hampered by these differences beyond the opening studio-imposed spoiler.My recommendation: watch the theatrical version the first time but skip to the clock. Start after the clock if you have to with everything muted and then rewind to the clock, unpause, and unmute.This film is begging for a new >4k re-telecine because the original telecine to digital was not great and the later 2k transfer for the director's cut only did the additional footage and didn't redo the original theatrical footage. Neither is up to modern standards now, but the theatrical transfer, in particular, has not aged well side-by-side on the bluray. Probably they need to go back to the original negatives, effects plates, and redo all the opticals digitally as was done on Aliens and Bladerunner. The first run prints of Dark City were unbelievably gorgeous like you cannot believe, with color and contrasts that I have never seen matched in any film before or since.",Dark City

Unfortunately it was a quite poor, barely watchable , low budget sci fi.I really can't believe how shallow, and heartless the acting is, the main character doesn't change his face expression throughout the whole movie, I fact no one does. Another really annoying thing was the scientists weird almost stutter, where he pauses between his words for no apparent reason and doesn't add anything to his character. Just annoyance for the watcher. On top of the poor acting, the special effects , make up , costumes are equally as poor, especially for a film in the 90s, I've seen better effects in the 70s!The story itself could have been an interesting concept, but it's all spoilt with the poor camera work, poor editing,poor acting and effects. I asked myself at least 5 times should I turn it off but I watched until the bitter end and watched the poor ending of the film too.I don't really need to write a plot as plenty of others have done that, but not one character acts well or is believable in the movie, it's all in all just a bit to silly.",Dark City

205,Roddy-15,Excellent film,10,3 July 2000,"This movie is very unusual. It is a mixture of a classical film noir with a science fiction film. Great special effects, great acting. Despite having a rather complicated plot, it is never difficult to follow.
There are some similarities to the Matrix. Both Neo and John Murdoch save the people of the world they live in. They both have superpowers. And they are both in a world that is controlled by non-human entities. But that's pretty much where the similarities end. Despite lacking the martial-art sequences of the Matrix, I believe Dark City is a better film all the way.

It has to some degree the same kind of themes as for example ""Matrix"" or ""Truman show"", but I think this might be the best of these films (you could see them as a genre). This film brings to my mind some big and important works from the last decades, for example Paul Auster's ""New York""-trilogy. The casting is good, quite unknown actors. The bad guys, which are clearly a tribute to Clive Barker's Cenobites, are to my opinion a little bit ridiculous and not scary at all. They feel somehow artificial, but on the other hand that fits to the idea. This is not only the deepest and best of the films mentioned before, it is also one of the most intelligent films made recently. Respect. Recommended for everybody.",Dark City
208,Nothinggrandproductions,A film that appears smart but is mostly a typical Hollywood flick,4,18 July 2014,"I guess I'm not really starting this new series of reviews in the best way if I'm starting with a movie I didn't like so much. Dark City is a very strange movie, right from the start it opens with narration by Dr. Daniel P. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) explaining a world that is inhabited by another species that are trying to take control of the humans with an ability called ""tuning."" Right from the start, you'll notice how annoying Kiefer Sutherland's acting is and trust me; you'll be annoyed throughout the entire film with the way he talks. It's painful to listen to as he breathes strange and talks weird for seemingly no reason instead of talking like a normal human being but that's a minor concern for this movie. After the opening narration scene (which is kind of pointless like most narration in films), John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakens from a hotel bathtub and is suffering from amnesia. And this is the part where I started to really get into the movie. Something strange is going on, he discovers a body he supposedly murdered, he gets a call from Dr. Schreber about how his memory is gone, and he makes his way onto the streets of the city and is trying to figure out what in the hell is going on and has a run-in with a group of men simply known as ""The Strangers."" It's a very interesting premise, it certainly draws you in but then it fails to deliver on nearly every level.One thing I noticed (especially in any action scenes) is the awful editing. The shots move so quickly and they just cut and cut and you can't even tell what is going on anymore because of it. It completely breaks immersion of the film when bad editing distracts you. Another aspect that breaks immersion is the bad 90s CGI, which is a problem for many Hollywood films in the 90s, the CGI was (mostly) awful. Okay, I admit, I didn't watch the director's cut of the film that supposedly improved the bad CGI but regardless, the excessive CGI in the 90s was god-awful and only a handful of films actually have CGI that holds up. (Jurassic Park is actually the only one that comes to mind). The movie does have a really engaging mystery throughout, you do wonder what is going on with these ""Stranger"" people and why some of the humans memories are erased/being scrambled with and why everything is so off in this city. It has ambitious ideas but fails to deliver any real consistent or interesting message and instead, devolved into typical Hollywood action blockbuster by the end. It could have been an engaging thought-provoking science fiction piece-especially with the premise-but instead it decides to have painfully boring to watch action scenes. Why is this film a cult classic? Frankly, I'm not entirely sure. I suppose it's under the category of Hollywood films that come off smarter than usual because Hollywood is fairly pathetic most of the time when it comes to new ideas or philosophical ones. Sort of like The Matrix that came out the following year and is also an incredibly overrated (sorry Matrix fans, I really don't find the film that interesting) piece that isn't some smart film with deep philosophical ideas. The movie does have a certain atmosphere that is pleasing to look at but the CGI and editing break that atmosphere completely and take you out of the film. Overall, I sort of get why this one is a cult classic just because it is ""different"" but different doesn't always mean good, I'd much rather watch a movie like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that deals with the ideas of memory and love (the love story in Dark City is fairly laughable) in a much more sophisticated nature.",Dark City
209,fiozinho,"Dark, Shmark",5,27 December 1999,"A series of impressive effects in search of a coherent storyline. All too convoluted and self-consciously odd for its own good, and very derivative of other films - there are bits of 'Blade Runner', 'Barton Fink', 'Metropolis', 'The Hunchback of Notredame'... and I defy anyone to see the flying 'Strangers' without thinking of demented Uncle Festers with the powers of Mary Poppins. Almost a saving grace are the performances - the actors have managed to stifle giggles so well that we believe that they believe in all this claptrap.

213,fidelio74,'Dark City' shines,7,25 December 2010,"Australian director Alex Proyas' 'Dark City' is a cerebral and splendid science fiction film noir. Many people have called it one of the best science fiction films ever made, and they are right. The film recalls 'Blade Runner', another sci-fi film noir. Proyas' vision is original and uncompromising, and he has crafted a wonderful head trip which really stays with you.John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes in a bathtub with blood on his forehead. He is suffering from amnesia and believes himself to be a serial killer. He must discover his true identity and find an escape from the eternally dark city in which he lives.Murdoch's love interest in the film is Jennifer Connelly, and she is very well-cast in the role of John's wife, Emma/Anna. She was wonderful in another film noir, 'The Hot Spot', in which she starred with Don Johnson. In 'Dark City' she plays a sultry nightclub singer who is racked with guilt after cheating on her husband.The best thing about 'Dark City' is the presence of the tall and thin Richard O'Brien, who played Riff Raff in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' way back in 1975. It is so great to see him again, and he lends a real gravitas to the proceedings. The Strangers, of which he is a member, are actually quite reminiscent of the Cenobites in the 'Hellraiser' franchise. These Strangers are an alien race who are trying to find out what makes us human. Every night at midnight, they induce the city's populace to fall asleep while they - the Strangers - change the city in order to alter our lives and to study how we respond.This is a clever and original film. Unlike some science fiction movies, it really stays with you.

The characters give you that sense of missing or a loss of what they once knew and trying to re experience it after the ways the aliens tried to do so.This was a well done film and something to be of interest of a non traditional alien vs humanity feel instead it's survival.

217,alafolle,A rare film: intelligent and highly original,10,22 June 2000,"Dark City is a deep, brooding masterpiece--visually stunning and more than a bit creepy. From the very first moments of the film it draws you into its alternate reality. Paranoia is the prevailing mood as shadowy figures control the world from behind the scenes and manipulate people's memories. Our hero, played by Rufus Sewell, wakes up next to the body of a woman he may have killed, his memories erased. His quest to find the truth about his life leads him to discover that nothing around him is as it seems.While the future-noir setting was influenced by such classic films as ""Blade Runner"" and ""Brazil"", and reality-bending plots have been seen in a number of recent sci fi flicks (""The Matrix"", ""The Thirteenth Floor"") the overall effect of ""Dark City"" is completely unique. The scenery and visual effects are fantastic and add to the atmosphere of fear, confusion, and suspense. The story is original and well-crafted, and the acting is generally superior. It raises thorny questions about the degree to which our access to objective truth is mediated by the press, by the filters of memory, by what we want to believe. There are also several in-jokes for anyone who's ever taken an Abnormal Psych class.It's a shame that this excellent movie was largely overlooked. The only major award it won, for best Sci Fi movie, it had to share with the loathsome ""Armageddon""--a travesty somewhat akin to the AFI declaring that ""Citizen Kane"" had to share Movie of the Century honors with ""Jaws: the Revenge"". Sacrilege!",Dark City
218,mr composer,Wall-to-wall scoring weakens the film,5,8 August 2003,"Dark City is an dark, interesting picture with acceptable to good acting, and a very strange character portrayed by Keifer Sutherland.What hurts this film is the score and the way it is used. The music starts with the main title and doesn't let up until the end credits. There is not a single unscored scene in the movie. The music itself is not bad. It's synth heavy and therefore gets to be monotonous in its orchestration. But the viewer becomes numb to the score after several minutes, and thus the music is no longer able to effectively engage the viewer into the film. It becomes more of a distraction. If 1/3 of the music could be intelligently eliminated, then this is a much smarter film and goes from a 5 in my ratings to an 8 or 9.Incidentally, the Star Wars movies are almost wall-to-wall, so are cartoons. Cartoons are generally shorter and historically stylistically acceptable with constant music. As far as the Star-Wars comparison: there isn't one. SW has much more eye-popping cinematography contrast, more diverse sound effects, and constantly shifting locations. Then there are two other points: the skill of John Williams is better than most film composers, including Christopher Young. JW also had the advantage of the London Symphony Orchestra. CY only had a synthesizer. No comparison.Incidentally, Young cannot be blamed for any decision as to how the score was spotted. Director Alex Proyas would have the final say. Too much music is usually a symptom of a director not having confidence in the visuals and storytelling on its own.",Dark City

This is a modern film-noir about noir; blackness that dominates the people's lives because of extraterrestrials that have dominated their minds. Of course, the rules of film noir are broken often and the premise? Sure it's terrible, but the film is so well made with respect to cinematography and camera that one almost overlooks the plot  looks beyond the cheap and stereotypical view of the aliens with superpowers, the simplistic cop  robber set up, and other such banal Hollywood elements. Just the use of modern and old technologies makes this film interesting  it reminds me of the video game series Myst. Both the game and this movie successfully incorporate the beautiful aspects of the past, and this movie does it very well  the rotary pulse telephone, the old classic cars and the garb on the people gets juxtaposed with the gene extractor-combiner, vending machines of the future and film projector. Very effective, and very eye catching and refreshing. Make sure you see it, but make sure you are patient when you do. ""When is the last time you remember seeing the sun?"" RATING: 7/10",Dark City
221,ronin1138,Why I am torn between the theatrical and directors cut,8,10 December 2020,"Firstly I do love this film, the story, the characters, look and effects. The theatrical cut does give away too much at the beginning but, the DC lacks any degree of subtilty and its spoken exposition often repeats itself. It is possibly Proyas's second best film after The Crow, almost everything else has been ok to utter rubbish. It seems like the DC does not imply anything but rather tells you exactly what is going on and albeit eventually. I can't help but think that in the hands of another director the film would have been better suited as more of a mystery or psychological sci-fi thriller and am sure many already think that this film is. It just could have been so much more. Like Inception or Lost highway and left unanswered questions as to who the strangers are, where they came from and what they were really doing and really hit cult status, by being more ambiguous. Instead in as many ways as possible the characters explain away what is going on like the audience are children. A hybrid cut between the TC and DC may be a solution. A cracking film though and Richard O'Brien was a fantastic casting choice.",Dark City

224,xodanielcasterox,Darker than the Matrix.,8,7 November 2014,"At first I thought this would be a Matrix ripoff until I looked at the time and realized this was released before the Matrix, but I don't believe the Matrix ripped off Dark City. I believe it was inspired by it as well as the Ghost in the Shell inspired it. It's pretty obvious that this was directed by the guy who did the Crow because it has the same tone. Dark and Gothic. I LOVE dark and Gothic films like the Crow, Batman, Batman Returns, Interview with the Vampire, Sweeney Todd, and so forth. And I love how dark this film is. In my opinion,it has a much better story than the Matrix, wondering if this world is not a world at all, that maybe it is some sort of set up and we're just an experiment or something. The only difference is the Matrix had mindless action including that awesome bullet dodge Reeves did, and sort of a complicated plot. With Dark City, it doesn't need mindless action or the plot to be more complicated than it already needs to be. It relies on story, suspense, atmosphere, and the plot itself is a little easier to follow than the Matrix. If you don't pay attention to the plot you will be confused and bored out of your mind. Also, Richard O'Brien. Aside from Rocky Horror Picture Show I will always remember him as Mr. Hand. If you like dark Gothic movies like the Crow, I think you'll like this one.",Dark City

The look of Dark City is impressive, but I also feel the characters are distanced from the audience in a way that harms the overall impact. Even though ""The Matrix"" is far ""hoakier,"" at least we feel some kind of kinship with the characters. In ""Dark City"" the characters are overwhelmed by their circumstances, and we never have a chance to feel anything for them. A few flashbacks don't do it. Since we are asked to follow ""John"" on his journey to discovery, at some point we should care about what he discovers. We don't, we are just curious. The movie ends up proving its own worst fears---the virtual reality of cinema CAN dissolve what makes being human so great---the ability to feel, to understand and care---to follow the path of a soul we are rooting for. Dark City provides no such soul in the character ""John.",Dark City
226,shulmanator,DING DING DING! You've found it! ...My #1 favorite film of all time!,10,23 September 2004,"This must be by far, the most underrated film of its time since Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" (1927). For once, Roger Ebert and I agree, this is our favorite film of 1998. Too bad that goggle-eyed albino zeppelin claims he enjoyed ""Garfield"" and ""Nutty Professor 2"", otherwise, he'd almost have credibility.In case you haven't done so, you should watch the movie again with Ebert's commentary after you've watched it normally. It's quite observational about the film's references and hidden metaphors. Oddly enough, Ebert pointed out a plot-hole that I never noticed before. Just how does Jennifer Connelly's character know where the prostitute lived? Oh well. I just have to add this at random... Richard O'Brien's ""Mr. Hand"" is the creepiest villain EVER! Better than Darth Vader, Freddy Kreuger, Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Agent Smith and Dick Cheney combined. I love this guy, and I'm not even that big on ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"".My original complaint when I first saw this film was that the ending seemed inconsistent with the mood established in the first 85% of the film. Now it doesn't bother me so much. The ending makes perfect sense, regardless of the change of the mood.The film bombed in theaters, and I blame the chosen cast, and the lack of explanatory advertising. Nobody knew what it was about, and the biggest star in it at the time was Kiefer Sutherland, who isn't an A-list guy.In a way, I'm kind of glad this film bombed, only because if it didn't, they'd try to make a sequel and tarnish the image of the original. Just look what sequels did to the original Matrix. It's funny when I think back and remember liking Dark City more than The Matrix, and everyone else telling me they thought the opposite. Ha! Talk about a reversal. You can't look at the original Matrix without thinking about how all the fighting that's going on is over that lousy excuse for an underground city of Babylon-5 extras. If they do that to Dark City, then that's it. I'm packing some pyramid-climbing equipment and tetnis shots and getting my ass to Mars like the Ahhnold.Go ALEX! Bring me more! 10/10",Dark City
227,vikramsamal,Father Of The Matrix..,9,22 January 2008,"Recently watched Dark City, had heard a lot about the movie from my friends but after watching it i feel it just lives up to all expectations. Its a movie which I would say gave birth to Matrix and its a shame its so underrated as a sci-fi movie. The visual scenery and mesmerizing magnanimous set-work just heightens the film's appeal and the plot I would say is very original for a movie of '98. Rufus Sewell is so good to watch, I wonder he has just been reduced to side-kick these days, I mean I liked him Illusionist but was wasted in Holiday..Its a shame for he is talented and presents a good picture with a mighty voice. Those were early days of Jennifer Connelly but she could have looked as good she acted in the movie. The graphics deserve a special mention and that spirit of human survival and emerging victorious is highly appealing. I don't know if Wachowskis took the idea of ""the one"" from this movie but i would now call Dark City the predecessor of The Matrix..Rating:9/10",Dark City

There is a lot of depth and emotion to each character, you empathize with them and care about them. It is beautifully rendered, the scenes are eye-catching and the pacing is great.

But wow...Alex Proyas has done such an astonishing job on this film it is hard to find a word good enough to describe it.  This film, besides being beautiful in shots, opens your mind up to new possibilities, and lets you leave the theater as a new person altogether. As far as the acting goes, it's excellent.  I kept on wondering where they found Rufus Sewell, and why he wasn't in any great movies prior to this. Also doing a surprisingly good job is Kiefer Sutherland, who continues to establish himself as a great, somewhat unknown actor.  I liked this movie so much, I even named my handle DarkCity.  If Alex Proyas continues such great work, he may be able to replace Stanley Kubrick as The King of Thinking Movies.",Dark City
230,mattwakeman,less than the sum of it's parts,6,26 March 2001,"now don't get me wrong, it's not that i don't this film, it's just that, well, it's just that it seemed to be a collection of quite a few films that have been put together. in some cases well, and in other cases badly...the direction is fine, the acting is fine (the exception, and only a slight exception is a rather insipid performance by jennifer connelly) and the story is, well, the story is really rather strange.to me this feels like this is somewhat a collection of ideas, rather on the lines of 'wouldn't it be good to get this in, but how about that. but hold on a second there is also that'. and instead of making the hard choices the director (and writer...and producer...and screenwriter) elected to keep them all. it's not bad, just a bit messy. why were the bad guys doing what they were? where are they from? where are the people in the city from? where are they going? why such an incomplete ending? why is that only one character (a good william hurt) asks any form of existential question and to sidestep that one not only is the question not answered but mr. hurt is 'removed' from the film? how is it that rufus sewell has the powers that he does? why is it that the bad guys look as though their costumes were thought up before the decision to see whether they would fit in with the rest of the design?now i don't believe that all fims have to be neat and precise, nor should they always answer all the questions that they ask but the problem that i have with this film is that on more than one occasion it is just inconsistent. not the characters as such but the story itself. as i said it's not awful but it could have been so much better. all the elements for a really good (albeit silly) film are present but they just don't hit it off and the film as a consequence just doesn't work. it is damning it with faint praise to say that i have seen better and i have seen worse.oh and incidentally, anybody who wants to see a great (and i mean great) film about memory should go and see memento. made on a fraction of the dark city budget but all of the money went on the right thing, the script!",Dark City
231,cheshire551225800,Brilliant In Almost Every Way,10,21 February 2009,"Although the main character is Johnny as played by Rufus Sewell (why is it that Brits can do American accents so much better than Americans can usually do British accents?) the real focus for me is Richard O'Brien.If we are supposed to feel the pathos of beings who don't understand their place in the universe then I find that more in O'Brien's performance than in Sewell's. Sewel's Johnny is a bit too innocent and well gosh darn motivated (a real can-do, let's fix it all up guy) for that. Kiefer Sutherland is great and Hurt and Connelly are a bit wasted in small but vital parts.I think personally that the reason why great actors like Hurt and Connelly would do small parts in this movie is that the film is original and intelligently written. Something that most actors I've seen interviewed state is practically non-existent in Hollywood.I own this movie and revisit it occasionally. It holds up over time and still plays as fresh and original. Think of it as what Riff Raff did after he blasted back to Transsexual Transylvania if you must, but watch it and enjoy.",Dark City
232,retromaster2000,Alex Proyas' Sci-Fi Masterpiece,8,1 September 2007,"This is one of the best newer Sci-Fi Films to come out of the 90's. Saw this film on TNT late at night back in 2003. It was edited for content of course also shown in Pan & Scan. I recently bought The New Line DVD that includes The Letter-Box Version on Side A also Pan & Scan Version on Side B. I have yet to watch it in LBOX yet I have just heard The 2 Audio Commentaries which are very informative as commentaries usually are on DVD's I buy like this. DVD has some nice extras. I would like to see The Director's Cut in the future which is 105 mins. which I heard would be nice to see a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD in the future of this film with nice behind the scenes footage. And a documentary about the making of the film. Dark City is a Sci-Fi-Thriller that blends mystery elements as well as the old Classic Film-Noir elements together to make one awesome Sci-Fi-Thriller. I guess technically u could classify it as a Sci-Fi-Mystery-Film-Noir-Thriller. But if u wanna be short & sweat it's a Sci-Fi-Thriller. I never knew of Alex Proyas before this. I, Robot (2004) which I saw on DVD in 2006 is also really awesome & I think is another one of Proyas Sci-Fi Masterpieces. Proyas a native of England had his first big hit with 1994's The Crow. DC's opening sequence of the story takes place in a bathroom where John Murdoch is in a bathtub naked with a dead guy in the bathroom. He has his mind & memory erased. The police are after him obviously thinking he committed the crime. He didn't he was married to Emma played excellently by Jennifer Connelly. Rufus Sewell's Murdoch character develops these strange telekinesis powers. Not only are the police after him but these weird pale white beings with powers like Murdoch's character as well. He has memories of his past life with his wife that he had meet at Shell Beach. Kiefer Sutherland plays a Doctor that was once John's teacher & is caught in the middle of helping these beings. It is a very weird story these beings control the city at midnight they stop time & change everything around. Their race is dying & they need the human soul in order to survive. Don't wanna say much more don't wanna spoil it for those that have yet to see it. I would also like to point out on the soundtrack Gary Numan's song Dark from his 1997 Exile album is present. Also an old Numan song from 1979 called Replicas the title track from that same album. A character in the song called Mr. Wall is also featured in this film he is one of the evil beings that is after Murdoch's character. I am snot sure if Proyas or the screenwritter got the idea for that character & name from Numan's Replicas song seems like it & I think that's so awesome since a lot of Numan's older stuff was Sci-Fi related & he was inspired by Sci-Fi Writter Phillip K. Dick. As well as 70's Classic Sci-Fi Films as Westworld (1973) & Soylent Green (1973). So I wouldn't be surprised if Proyas got his idea for Mr. Wall from Numan's Replicas song which has the same character name in it. Replicas by the way is my favorite Numan song very dark & awesome song with Sci-Fi lyrics. So u could relate & link a lot of Numan's songs & albums to Proyas' Dark City. Especially Numan's 1980 album Telekon. What can I say great movie one of my favorite newer Sci-Fi Films. Seems though Hollywood today is dying & can't come up with Films like this much anymore I, Robot (2004) & Transformers (2007) are the last 2 Sci-Fiers I thought were really good. Transformers the movie is Sci-Fi The Transformers movie technically isn't the original start. Since it originally came from Japanese Comic Books & the 80's Cartoon Series as well as the 80's Cartoon Movie. Then Beast Wars came around later. Seems all most Movie Makers do today is do remakes of Classic Sci-Fi Films I ain't gonna sit here & name the many remakes that only just came out. I am sure die-hard Sci-Fi & Horror Fans like myself know of the remakes. Some movies like the Sci-Fi Classic ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers""(1956) have been remade for the third time. Invasion (2007) with Nicole Kidman just came out on Friday Aug. 17, 2007 there is an example enough of that though anyway Dark City is awesome & they don't make em' like this much anymore 8 out of 10!",Dark City
233,Mr. Superbad,It's just so... so... boring...,4,24 October 1999,"There is just so much wrong with this movie that I don't see how people can like it so much. First there is the constant chase music playing in the background. It just doesn't let up. It's even in the boring dialogue scenes where it just doesn't belong. Some character could be asking to pass the mustard and there would be chase music playing. Why did they do this? It doesn't make the movie any more exciting, just annoying.The movie looks neat, and there are some good chase sequences, but that's about all it adds up to. If you find ""dude... what if.. like... my reality... may not be actual REALITY!!!"" plotlines deep and meaningful, then you should find this movie deep and meaningful. I don't, and was just bored thoroughly during almost all of the movie.",Dark City
234,snakejenkins,One of My Favorites.,10,20 July 2000,It's rare to find a sci-fi film that's actually high concept. Dark City is one of the few that combines ideas with visuals extremely well.  For a low budget film it is powerful and interesting to watch.  The story is kind of new and the mysterious plot twists through out are perfect to keep me watching and wondering.  Alex Proyas had a rough start with The Crow (a film I also liked) but shows his true colors and strength with Dark City.,Dark City
235,yanbibiyan,"creepy, heart warming and fantastical",9,16 September 2009,"simply wonderful on every level. A matrix meets Truman show if you will. Remarkably the film works despite its weird. wonderful and uncomfortable story line. Genuinely disturbing, as interesting as any murder mystery and beautiful atmosphere with art deco, film noir, and night on elm street under belly.At first you will be tempted to draw comparisons with the matrix and at other times the mind wonders and the ghostly tall men enter our dreams, but as the film progresses the human heart begins to take centre stage particularly in the characters of the two police chiefs as well as the central figure of John Murdoch. All in all a cascading and multi-dimensional cinematic delight that left me feeling unsettled and warm at the same time.watch it.",Dark City
236,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,"Where am I, who am I and have the Wachoskis read the script I'm in?",9,18 April 2002,"When The Matrix was released, a lot of people got considerably excited. More than a few sci-fi diehards, however, pointed out that, at some points, The Matrix is very, very similar to Alex Proyas 1998 film Dark City, which hadn't been as much of a success as The Matrix. And both movies are indeed similar. Both The Matrix and Dark City deal with worlds that are not at all what they seem to be and ordinary people finding out there's a saviour in them as well. Beyond that, both films are amalgams of pop culture; everything from Philip K. Dick to comic books went into the blender when making either of them (although Dark City is more film noir than Hong Kong-style action fest). Then there's the presence of seemingly invincible bad guys (of course dressed in token black) - with the spoon bending kid from The Matrix portraying one of them in Dark City. Even some of Dark City's sets were used in The Matrix.If you think this is leading to a comment where I criticise The Matrix for being a mass-marketed rip-off of Dark City: It's not. The Matrix is a hugely popular film for a reason: it's good. The Wachowski brothers' mixture of pop culture, philosophy and computer science is a far more a science fiction film than Dark City. The Matrix is more grounded in our daily reality than Dark City, what is presented is more an extension of our current technological knowledge than a pure fantasy. Because that's the direction Dark City takes in the final reel. The Matrix also has a level of complexity and depth (the nature of reality and perception of it, the birth and evolution of consciousness) which Dark City does not possess. Thematically it's limited to one question, albeit an interesting one: are we humans defined by our past, our memories or is there something else which constitutes our soul? (can you guess the film's answer, by the way?). But defending The Matrix against people who dislike it simply because Dark City predates it, is not my (whole) point.That whole point is that both movies are in different ways extremely entertaining. I've discussed The Matrix' merits over Dark City. Now the other way around. Dark City is fast, very fast. It races along at absolute top speed. Certain points are made in scenes no longer than a few seconds. Even the dialogue scenes race by, with director Alex Proyas creating a brilliant feel of constant pursuit. And it never lets up. Basically it's a two-hour plus epic squeezed into ninety minutes, which considering all those awfully stretched out three-hour movies that seem almost standard nowadays (Pearl @%^@# Harbour, anyone?) is a bit of a switch. If your attention drops for one second, you'll miss something. And even with constant attention, you'll probably miss something too. And there's a lot to be missed. The sets are absolutely amazing, most special effects are too and the soundtrack (constantly present, even during dialogue scenes, heightening the film's pace even more) is brilliant. In such a powerhouse of moviemaking, actors tend to get lost but here only Kiefer Sutherland does. His Mengele-with-guilt character is no more than the addition of a couple mannerism and a peculiar speech pattern. Rufus Sewell is wonderful as confused saviour, however and so is the rest, who give either beautiful melancholic performances (William Hurt and the often underrated Jennifer O'Connely) or really weird (and occasionally funny) ones (Richard O'Brien).The big surprises are hinted at early and many, but it doesn't matter because so strong is the sense of forward motion throughout the film you'll be waiting what Proyas will come up with next. And he keeps the best for last. A great twist, a transcendental awakening, a final battle, a victory for individuality and a load of special effects which even makes The Matrix look understated, it's the perfect climax to 90-minutes of near-perfect sci-fi pop culture mish-mash. It may have a video clip style, but Dark City is only MTV-moviemaking if you don't use the term in a derogatory fashion. It's a film aimed at people more responsive to audiovisual stimuli (you simply can't miss the Blade Runner reference) than verbalized ones, but also one that's as fluent in its storytelling as any other classic masterpiece you may be thinking of. It may not be perfect (the opening voice-over is possibly the best reason to quit that awful Hollywood test screening practice right now) and it's highly derivative (the memory-swapping plot is pure K. Dick) but as far as '90's science fiction goes this is up there with the best of the best (which is, you guessed it, The Matrix).Rating: 9/10",Dark City
237,kingderella,very nice fantasy/sci-fi,8,27 February 2008,"it is almost impossible to write about dark city without comparing it to the later released but more successful matrix. in both movies, somebody realizes that there is something terribly wrong with the world he lives in, and tries to find out about it and fight its secret masters. both movies use sci-fi/fantasy to raise philosophical questions about reality and humanity; both movies wrap their heady messages in thrilling plots, lush, somber production designs and spectacular special effects. however, dark city differs from matrix by being set in a dark, Gothic, almost fairytale like retro world based on the early 20th century rather than in a post-apocalyptic cyber-punk future. it looks a bit like a restrained tim burtons take on metropolis.the plot starts off a little confused, but it all comes together (more or less) as the story unfolds. the characters are a little flat, but the casting and acting is solid (although i wished the main character was a little bit more handsome). some special effects are a little dated now, but others are still mind-blowing (such as the buildings that grow out of the ground). and i cant stress enough how gorgeous the production design is, something the DVD-covers don't even hint at. that makes the frenetic editing and the overblown soundtrack all the more frustrating, as they prevent the visuals from unfolding all their potential. still this is a movie well worth watching, especially for those who like their fantasy dark and Gothic.",Dark City
238,*Prometheus*,Decent Sci-fi,7,1 December 1998,"At first the movie may seem a little too gothic for some. But as the story unfolds you find out why. It may be a little hard to follow at in the beginning, but later in the movie you see why things are the way they are. Overall it was a pretty good movie. The thing I liked the most was that it took a step off the beaten path of the average sci-fi/horror genere. I gave it a 7. For sci-fi fans with an open mind and not stuck to the likes of ""Armageddon"" type movies, this is one to watch.",Dark City
239,The Truth,"Good film, bad ending (major spoilers).",8,19 May 2000,"When I went to see Dark City I didn't really have such high hopes for it. The trailer had been excellent, but remembering the directors previous effort, the highly overrated Crow, I expected Dark City to be nothing more than a violent and silly gothic fantasy. So you can guess that I was positively surprised, when the film turned out to be an intriguing science fiction mystery with a touch of film noir. The actors were mostly good and Dark City even payed homage to many of my favorite movies and comics (the basic idea may even have been borrowed from one of Mézières' and Christin's classic Valerian comic books ""Sur les Terres Truquées""), so I was beginning to change my opinion about Alex Proyas as a director. Dark City was just as stylish as Crow, but it had much more content. Unfortunately, during the final scenes, the script showed the same weakness Crow suffered from; Dark City is unable to come up with a satisfactory ending, so it resorts to clichés. I guess it really wasn't that big a surprise, since this problem has been far too evident with most sci-fi films of the nineties, including Strange Days and Matrix.In fact Dark City shared the exact same problem with The Matrix: the intellectual premise didn't quite match up with the stupid FX ending. Admittedly, The Matrix didn't pretend to be more than an action flick with some interesting-but-overused sci-fi themes, so it's ending (with the kung fu fights and ""kiss to awaken the dead"" scene) was not as disappointing as is the ending of Dark City. Dark City at least had some originality and intellect, which is why I find it hard to understand why it had to end with an FX-enhanced good-guy-versus-bad-guy fight. When the hero threw the bad guy through the water tank, remembering that the aliens can't stand water (for reasons unexplained), it really made me want to cry out loud. If that wasn't a major cliché (and a stupid one too), what is?Also, although the final scene in Dark City did a bit to redeem the film, it's quite hard to believe that the guy could live in his world knowing what it truly is. He should at least have had his memories erased, in the same manner the traitor in The Matrix wanted his knowledge of The Matrix to be deleted.Not to sound too critical, I must say that, the ending excluded, I think Dark City is a clever and beautifully visualized film. Still, as a science fiction fan, I find it sad that there have been three recent films toying with the old sci-fi idea of fake reality (Dark City, The Truman Show, The Matrix), and the best one of these three is The Truman Show which isn't even a sci-fi flick.",Dark City

How the protagonist solves the mystery is so great, how he puts the pieces together is intelligent and thrilling. On the other hand the others seem a bit chalky, dusty and they have no real character. I think this was intentional, but still: the evils they seem a bit ridiculous at some points.

241,Jqn_Hgar,My Thoughts on why this film is one of the best I've ever seen,9,29 June 2016,"Dark City is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen and I think part of that isn't just because I like Science Fiction, it's rather because of it being also a Film Noir and not just aesthetically it goes further down to the script which contains all the elements that makes a film a Film Noir, there's the the protagonist who suffers from amnesia and he's being hunted down by some mysterious guys then we find the side kick who serves well at explaining plot points there's also the detective and last but not Least the woman. I'm not gonna go through the plot, it's been 18 years since the movie was released and i don't think it needs any introduction because it's more famous now than it ever was when it first came out. I felt Dark City was a near perfect movie, it's well directed it's gorgeous to look at the film noir aesthetics blended with the great special effects of the Science Fiction movie Genre and I Still think the movie holds up pretty damn good for a film that was released nearly two decades ago. On the other side of the camera the actors did a fine job, nothing Oscar worthy but just self aware performances maybe it's Rufus Swell's best work basically because he hasn't been in many good movies ever since. Overall it's a pretty good science fiction Mystery, I don't recall i ever looked at the runtime not a single once when I was watching it, the script is very solid and I think it's a movie worthy of viewing at least once in your lifetime if you're a movie lover.",Dark City

Great acting, but more importantly, a gripping story and characters that you care about. Comparing this to the by-the-numbers cardboard of Neo and Morpheus just isn't fair to John Murdoch, Detective Bumstead and Mr. Hand. The Agents of the Matrix have no chance against the likes of the aliens in the Dark City. I'll skip over the fantastic cinematography and visuals effects because so many others have already done them justice. If you haven't seen this and have seen ""The Matrix"", I think you'll easily reach my own conclusion to which movie is superior. Add to the fact that ""Dark City"" came out a year ahead of time.

I know this phrase is used a lot, but this film honestly is quite unlike anything before or since. There certainly are some Matrix parallels (although this movie predates The Matrix by a year), but where The Matrix was far more mainstream in it's execution, Dark City is anything but mainstream. The casting is superb across the board - Rufus Sewell (never been better in my opinion), Jennifer Connelly, William Hurt, Ian Richardson, Kiefer Sutherland (as you've never seen him before), and the amazing Richard O'Brien in a role he was just born to play!

I don't care--writer/director Alex Proyas (""The Crow"") has given us of the most visually audacious and thought-provoking genre films in years.  Fans of genre fiction, television, and film (for instance, ""Blade Runner"") will be familiar with the themes presented here: What is the nature of humanity?  How do I know where I belong?  Are my memories true?  Is there some great conspiracy underlying everything I know?  Am I the subject of some secret experiment?  How do I know what is real?  Who am I, really?  Am I sane?  How can I be sure of anything--or anyone?  Who is in control?  ""Dark City"" is unrelentingly demented, dark and vicious, disturbing in the extreme, and well worth seeing.  In repeat viewings, I've come to realize that the acting is far more subtle and intense than I had at first realized.  Kiefer Sutherland, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly and Rufus Sewell are all in good form, and what at first might appear to be lack of depth in characterization is actually a finely realized ""incompleteness"" in the characters themselves. The special effects are first-rate, especially considering the relatively modest budget; the on-screen transformations of the city as it is ""tuned"" are wondrous to behold.

249,peter-j-downey,"Interesting idea, poorly executed.",6,24 February 2015,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) awakes with no memories, in an apartment with an eccentric doctor (Keifer Sunderland) who makes little sense, in a city where the sun never shines, and ghoul like beings haunt every corner. Murdoch tries to piece together what's going on in this nightmarish landscape, these ghouls are however doing their best to stop him.Alex Proyas tries to weld two genres together; noir and sci-fi, and this complicated, b-movie-esque film is the result. Visually this film is unique; the ghouls inhabit a steam-punk underworld, while Murdoch and the humans occupy a world frozen in the 1940s. The contrast works well with the lighting and angles chosen by Proyas. However the editing is a mess, in the first 30 minutes there are possibly 300 cuts, this frantic editing undermines the visuals completely, and it took me much longer than it should to immerse myself in the world. Proyas also mimics the Star Trek style for action sequences, and while sci-fi fans may get some kick out of this, it just felt cheesy to me.Acting in this film is a mixed bag; the performances themselves are top notch and Kiefer Sunderland is particularly impressive. The doctor is a wretched, worm like man, yet Sunderland plays him with a great deal of compassion. There are many scenes where we can empathise with this broken man, and Sunderland behaves like a kicked dog.It's the direction, however, that weakens the acting in this film. Anything involving a green screen the actors tense up and look lost. In one of the character's death he falls into a computer generated back ground and the look on his face is one of confusion. There is also a montage sequence with Sunderland and he delivers his lines so awkwardly it feels like he is reading them for the first time. Did Proyas not outline to them how these scenes were going to be inserted into the film?Dialogue in this film is also a bit hackneyed; Jennifer Connolly, in particular, has to deliver some stale lines. Parts of the script should definitely have been re-written, as the phrasing for some of the conversations seems so familiar that it feels like parody. There is some self-awareness to this film, and it was a fun to watch. Proyas also manages to capture a fin-de-siècle atmosphere that was typical at the turn of the 21st century, and there could be even some direct comparisons made to The Martrix. This film was recommended to me as a cult classic, and I can easily imagine some people having a great affinity for Dark City. Still, it was a little bit naff.",Dark City

253,jacklyn_lo,Dark movie. Underdeveloped protagonist. Unjustified cruelty.,2,12 June 2016,"This movie is about a fight between John Murdoch and aliens, who came to the Earth from outer space for their survival. The Aliens are presented as entities with supernatural abilities, such as teleportation, hypnosis, and collective consciousness. However, in order to get through, they are hunting for humans' memories. The aliens understand they will benefit from getting a variety of humans experiences. The daily implementation of their strategy is - to freeze humans in the city at 12:00 am sharp, to change an surrounding for each human, to send a doctor to make a new-memory-injection into each human's brain. The doctor is the only one who does these injections. In accordance to the plot, John Murdoch has got the same super power as the aliens. The plot is built around one of the most mysterious matters for human kind - memories. A memory, in the movie, is shown as a liquid, which is a subject to be analyzed and to embed into a human or alien. (In accordance to New age knowledge human's memories of the current life belong to consciousness; the memories of the past lives- to subconscious. The both, consciousness and subconscious, are properties of our soul, and the access to our souls is given only to super power entities, such as God and his assistants). I agree, that the assumption that a certain city on Earth has been taken under the control of aliens, is making for a thrilling effect. However, the implementation of this idea in Dark City is pretty weak. The aliens' intentions look like an expensive, absurd and improbable project.In addition, there is an unwarranted violence from them; they have cruelly killed humans, which are valuable resources for them, without any proper reason. Although they were so powerful that they even could control the Sun, they use such a primitive weapon as a knife to murder people. The story could have been much stronger if there had been an explanation as to why John M and only him got the supernatural capabilities.During the movie, I have been asking myself– what is a targeted audience for this play? Kids? Too much violence. Adults? Too many naive ideas.",Dark City

255,AJ_Franklin-2,Hey Mr. Spaceman...give me a break.,3,8 June 2001,"Roger Ebert or not, ""Dark"" is the best word to describe this one. It has the look and feel of a well-made movie, but spacemen floating in and out of their surreal nighttime-only space-city, with a setting that emulates the 1920's, just takes it too far out for me.I usually enjoy Kiefer Sutherland, but his performance here is worse than a tortoise on prosac. And he is better than the others!Some of the plot ideas and mediocre Fx still rate it 3/10 stars. Save it for a rainy night when the video store is out of all the good stuff. :-/",Dark City
256,john_murdoch2002,One of the Best Movies Ever Made,10,12 June 2004,"Words can't begin to describe the admiration that I have for this movie. Even to this day, six years after seeing it for the first time, I can't get over the freshness, originality, and overall boldness of Alex Proyas' visionary masterpiece. Now that Proyas is getting a larger budget for I, Robot this year, I felt that it would be time to credit Proyas' earlier science fiction masterpiece in anticipation that I, Robot would only live up to this film. From the opening shots of this film, the viewer is instantly plummeted into a bold and grand setting of an indistinct city that seems that this is how noir films of the forties would look if they were in color. After a display of the bizarre occurrence that happens to the city around midnight, we are introduced to the film's protagonist, a man named John Murdoch, who awakens in a bathtub, with no memory of his life or how he got where he was. Needless to say, what happened to the dead woman next to his bed. After a few clues that seem to trigger brief glimpses of his childhood, he is chased from his room by three odd looking figures, looking for him.As Murdoch wanders the city, trying to find his identity, we learn that not only are the strange people (who are appropriately named The Strangers) looking for Mr. Murdoch, but a police officer named Bumstead is as well, searching for the killer of not just the woman in the apartment, but six other women who were murdered in the same manner as the woman from Murdoch's room. Also is Murdoch's estranged wife, who is trying to make a reconciliation with him after a falling out. Even a therapist that Murdoch has been seeing because of his wife's infidelity is searching for him as well. Everyone seems to have their own reason to be searching for Murdoch, and Murdoch is trying to figure out why, since he has no clue as to who he is. In a sense, Murdoch's quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him. Is he a murderer, is he a jilted lover, is he psychologically damaged person, or is he a like the strangers who are pursuing him?But that becomes the center question of Dark City itself, do we make up who we are or are we made up of experiences and memories? We realize this question when we realize the purpose of the Strangers' inhabitance of the city. They are actually aliens, whose race is dying out and they need to observe the human race to see what has made us thrive so much. So, we enter their experiment, which revolves around making the inhabitants of the city fall asleep at midnight while the strangers give them new lives by implanting new memories in them and changing the environment around them.Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does. He has also begun to take on the traits of the strangers as well, gaining their power to ""tune"", which is the ability to alter their environment by will alone. This whole concept suggests two things, the first being that humanity has the ability to adapt and thrive in a new environment and the other is that as an individual, humans have the ability to shape their world to their own desire once they are fully aware of themselves and their desires.The movie in itself is a brilliant commentary on our society as a whole which is displayed in the beginning with Dr. Schreber's rat experiment in the lab, which comes to symbolize a smaller scale version of the strangers' experiment for us, putting rats (humans) in a maze of a city (life) and seeing if they can find their way. Which also seems to suggest that as a society, we are merely just rats in a maze, wandering around until we come to the end. The strangers' insistence on doing everything as a group also brings up another interesting point about the human race is that our ability to be individuals is what makes humans thrive rather than conformity and similarity. ""Dark City"" takes such bold and brilliant concepts, suggesting so much about our society as a whole and even the importance of individuality over conformity. The themes, once read into, take on such a strong and complex turn, unheard of in most science fiction films of recent years.Then there is the matter of the setting itself, for no science fiction film can be complete without a strong and symbolic setting. The setting is vast and detailed, and this isn't just the city, which is a sight to behold in itself. The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them. The city above ground displays a rich noir feel in which one feels that there is something sinister lurking underneath it's surface. Even the blending of the time periods, seeing 30s architecture around 60s cars driven by people in 50s suits is even a hint off that the city has been fabricated out of different eras and pasts as one of the strangers even seems to suggest.""Dark City"" is a film rich in ideas, concepts, visual splendor, and atmosphere. It's the kind of film that one seems to enjoy being lost in, despite the danger that lurks in it's atmosphere. It's a film that reassures it's viewers that a strong understanding of oneself and staying true to yourself that one can conquer any world they are placed in. And as I, Robot approaches, one can only hope that lightning can strike twice with Proyas and his unique blend of visual grandeur and his depth will emerge and be embraced by a larger audience, who might seek out this film.",Dark City
257,isenberg-e,"Finally a movie as good as ""Bladerunner"" and ""The Matrix""",9,19 June 2002,"Others both within IMDB and in external reviews have done a better job than I ever could in commenting on this film. I would only add a few things I liked and didn't like, and something important I thought the film left out.Positive: the incredible production design and art direction, which I thought reminiscent of Tim Burton's vision of Gotham City in the original ""Batman""; the original concept similarly and virtually simultaneously addressed by ""The Matrix;"" and the understated acting that didn't get in the way (with one exception, noted below).Negative: whoever was responsible (Director Alex Proyas, probably) for the acting mannerisms used by Kiefer Sutherland (an actor I liked in the excellent TV drama ""24"") obviously needs some time in solitary confinement so he can rethink his decision. Sutherland's character alone got in the way of the script and broke through my Willing Suspension of Disbelief; he was an over-the-top cross between our image of Dr. Mengele and the spectacled Nazi in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I also thought the final duel between the hero and villain could have had 30-45 seconds cut out to better effect.Summary: a combination of the film noir exhibited by ""Bladerunner"" and much of the plot of ""The Matrix,"" I give it a 9. It would have earned a 10 from me had Sutherland's acting been less affected and obtrusive.A Major Issue Not Addressed: The film was an effort to answer the question, ""Do Memories Make The Person?"" It left us with a different question most of us already believe we know the answer to, which is, slightly reworded, ""Power Corrupts, but does Absolute Power Always Corrupt Absolutely?"" Can a good person with good intentions surmount ""The Dark Side"" inherent within all of our ID's? Perhaps the end of ""Dark City"" could have been similar to the one in ""Sphere"" had it only appeared first.",Dark City
258,petersaarloos,"Visually appealing, but fails in most respects",5,14 February 2019,"This movie seems to receive praise, but I am not sure why. The visuals are striking, but that is about the only redeeming factor of this movie. There is some good acting by William Hurt and Jennifer Connoly, but it is ruined by the stiff acting of Rufus Sewell, the main protagonist. At times, I wondered if they had shot the scenes with the actors in the same room.The plot is horribly overexposed. Everything is explained by the characters in a manner clearly directed at the audience in a 'tell, don't show' manner. The few things I actually would have liked to know something about, namely why John Murdoch was special or where the alien creatures came from, was kept entirely from the audience. The movie seems to try very hard to be intellectually cohesive, without actually being clever.By far the strongest point is the beginning, where we are left to wonder if John Murdoch is actually a killer, but the plot rushes forward so fast and explains everything so clearly that we quite quickly understand that this is not the case, and the real suspense dies. The final scene especially, where John Murdoch and the main villain duke it out in a Dragonball Z 'my-beam-versus-your-beam' battle was plain silly.Dark City is by no means a bad movie; I've seen plenty worse with bigger budgets. But I can't recommend it, nor can I understand why people seem to think this is a classic.",Dark City

260,Dr.Jolly,Possibly the best science fiction movie since Terminator 2.,10,9 July 1999,"This movie is truly incredible. Alex Proyas had already gained much appraisal for The Crow, a movie that I didn't like, so I doubted all the hype for this one when it came out (boy was I surprised). This was right up with Saving Private Ryan last year as the best movie in 1998. In fact, this movie was so good that it spawned off two 1999 summer movies that were also loosely based off of multiple universes (The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor). If you aren't a typical fan of science fiction, this movie may need to be watched more than once to get the full affect (like in 12 Monkeys). Rufus Sewell does an excellent job as the lead role, but in most cases, anybody probably could have played the role. Kiefer Sutherland is always excellent and shows no difference with his role as the mad-doctor type. Jennifer Connelly is barely noticed and is merely an attractive woman playing a transparent role. William Hurt remains the most boring actor in Hollywood, but doesn't have enough lines to bring the movie down. The real point is that it would be truly impossible to knock this movie down. The graphics are incredible and are balanced with the best background construction since Dick Tracy. The darkness is constant but brings the dark beauty that is so cool in this movie. While the story is great and is very unique, it may be very hard for many to truly understand the movie at a first setting. This may explain why many viewers complained of boredom in the theater. Dark City was just truly awesome and should be viewed by any science fiction buff or movie watcher. This movie has a chance to be a rental classic. I gave it a perfect 10 out of 10.",Dark City
261,dltdvd,Brilliant storytelling...,10,20 July 2002,"When I was first about to watch ""Dark City,"" I really had no idea on what it was about, what the characters would be like, or whether or not the film's visual storytelling would work. The thing I admire about films like this is that you hardly know about the movie until you actually see it.I've had some bad relationships with movies that tell their story visually. For example, ""The Matrix,"" although having some cool special effects, wasn't really that good of a movie. It really didn't tell the story with special effects the way ""Dark City"" did.One fantastic thing about ""Dark City"" is the beautiful production design by Patrick Tatopoulis. It reminded me of movies like ""Batman,"" as it was impossible to determine when this movie takes place. The characters in the movie also don't talk like they do today (A prostitute says ""shoot"" rather than ""sh*t"").Having not seen enough of director Alex Proyas' movies, I can already tell that he's a genius behind the camera. He often utilizes Dutch angles, which help with the visual storytelling. He can tell a story with just enough special effects, which don't get in the way of the experience.""Dark City"" is a movie that's definitely ahead of its time. It's story and storytelling are wonderfully inventive and they constantly ask you questions. ""Dark City"" defines exactly what filmmaking is: an art. And the art in this movie is crafted with pure genius with its direction, photography, editing, and production design. Director Proyas knows that special effects should be told with the story, and that they always come second. Not many movies get to be like ""Dark City,"" and this is one that should be remembered for a long time to come.",Dark City
262,dltdvd,Truly a work of genius...,10,28 March 2003,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), an amnesiac who can't remember his wife, ends up in a city with no sunshine controlled by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans in what is by far one of the most stylish sci-fi movies ever made.A clever combination of sci-fi, suspense, and film-noir, ""Dark City"" is an intellectual mind-bender that truly defines the art of filmmaking.In the bleak, urban setting, John Murdoch wanders the nightmarish city to try and remember his past and what he left behind. His wife, Emma, played by the lovely Jennifer Connelly, shines as a ballroom singer struggling with a husband that doesn't remember her.William Hurt plays Frank Bumstead, the workaholic detective obsessed with solving a case that may or may not involve John Murdoch. And Kiefer Sutherland plays Dr. Daniel Shreber, John's mentor with a truly eccentric personality as he continually makes two- or three-worded phrases to make a point.Director Alex Proyas (""The Crow"") manages this dark and unique sci-fi film in such a way that it actually stirs the viewer's imagination. Proyas' artistic genius is really shown in this film, as we are constantly showered with the combination of sci-fi and film-noir visuals that have never even been attempted in a movie.Definately an alternative film, ""Dark City,"" is for artists and general movie-goers alike. Its mind-bending story and bleak, yet colorful, sets will continue to be more unique than anything I've (or we've) ever seen before, or will see again.

263,mullaryn,Surprisingly good. A more human-based Matrix,8,9 January 2009,"This movie surprised me. I read a brief plot summary for it, and was hesitant to watch it, because it seemed to me that I was in for another cheap action flick based on alien life forms and a plucky human hero who rises from the bottom blah blah blah...After it ended, I was left with a pleasant sense of content. This movie was NOT a cheap action flick, and in fact carried even a somewhat worthy message. It was quite well done in terms of acting: this movie put Rufus Sewell and William Hurt on the map for me. Rufus Sewell played a confused and desperate hero who had no idea that he was a hero until it was either that or die. William Hurt plays an open-minded police detective who, in my opinion, feels that something is wrong in this bustling city of his.The soundtrack to this film is quite appropriate. It is rather pointless, but fits the dark and at the same time fast-paced mood of the film well. The ending of this film, in my opinion, is a magnificent one, second only to 'Fight Club', 'The Truman Show', and 'The Thing'.There were some places where the film could be better. I was kind of disappointed in the alien life-forms. They seemed a bit too... stiff. They could have been developed a bit more. Keifer Sutherland played the role of a VERY scared doctor well enough, but could've done better.A solid 8/10.",Dark City

The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. I'd go as far and say the visual experience was as good as Blade Runner, if not better.

266,Chronus,One of the darkest stories ever told on movies,9,10 August 1999,"Well, dark may be, but not violent. This is one of the strangest tales I´ve ever seen produced by the movie industry. It´s not of those flashy works that Hollywood seems so proud to give birth to again and again. It´s complex enough and has an atmosphere very similar to that which we find in Hitchcock´s films and Blade Runner.And once again, like in The Matrix, things are not what they appear to be. Kind of resembles the work produced by master science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick. In Dark City, you just wait, follow the hero, collect the information (well given) and mistrust what your eyes and conscious thoughts tell you.Dark City was not a huge success, but that, ironically, constitutes proof that it is a strange but good movie. Nowadays, most people, irrespective of their location in the world (USA, Europe, Asia), seem to be more at ease when they go to the cinema to see something like ID4 or Armaggedon than when they face a treasure like Dark City, Blade Runner or The Matrix. They complain (even critics) that these movies are too complicated or too subtle to be seen and understood in mere two hours. Talk about dramatic drops in IQ ratings...The special effects of Dark City are good enough and give credibility to the story. The plot could be more complex (as happens with The Matrix), but Hollywood standards demand that you, as director, should not make people think too much while watching the movie...or else...spectators will shy away from the movie.The acting is good. Rufus Sewell is good, Kiefer S. is even better, and mr. Hurt portrays an inspector with a rather grey life in a low profile personal performance. The strange ""Men in Black Overcoats"" are really disgusting and scary to look at.The finale should have been more...bigger-than-life, one of those events that make you think about it long after you see it.I bought the video and watch it with delight, although I didn´t go to the cinema 4 times to see it, as happened with The Matrix and Blade Runner.All in all, a good movie, different, where the director had the guts to tell a story at a pace and in a way that most movies released nowadays will not show.",Dark City

And I don't understand why people think the ending is a let down. Those final shots of him recapturing the love of his life have to be among the most romantic images ever put in a ""sci-fi"" movie. He creates Shell Beach, brings light to the world, and meets the woman he fell in love with who now suffers from the amnesia that he suffered with at the beginning. She stood up for him while his memories were gone, now he'll do the same for her. This is what true love is all about, and we know they'll get together. Plus the movie has a great SCORE.

This is set in a Gotham-like city, in a made up world, in an unknown time frame. The film explores a man, John Murdoch who doesn't know what's happening to him and the world around him. The story unfolds and makes more sense to him during the process of the film. Once you start the film, you'll never stop. This is one of those great films about the loss and confusion of memory like Total Recall and Memento. But this is more fantasized, creating it more different, and original. The music never stops! It's a great well-made story with excellent characters which makes this film ground breaking. One of the most technical, original films executed. What I don't understand is how this isn't in the IMDB Top 250. I know this film didn't do good in the box office, but that means nothing now, because the film is so amazing.

The story reveals at a well-timed pace, keeping you confused and spellbound at the same time. A really great role for Jennifer Connelly and having an unknown as the lead was a big plus to the film.The world contained in the story is complete and self-contained. The ghoul-like Strangers, as Keifer Sunderland explains in the intro, are a race as old as time that have captured humans to perform experiments upon. A scene with a rat maze illustrates their morality in back-hand way.Richard O'Brian and Ian Richardson have great cameos as Strangers.

This one does have clean cinematography though, with okay acts by Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Stherland, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly. If one is intrigued by the mystery of our very existence then this kind of movie is surely going to provide some food for thought. If one day you get up and find that everything around you is just a big lie and the whole world surrounded you is fabricated, manipulated then what will be your reaction.

After seeing massively hyped no-brainers like Lethal Weapon 4, Armageddon and Godzilla this was really surprising. The first half of the movie reminded me of the classic film-noirs of the 40s and 50s, and the loud, adventure-packed second half brought back memories of Sci-Fi cults like Blade Runner, Total Recall and Eraserhead. The lead- Rufus Sewell- gives a pretty 2-d but wonderfully confused performance as the unlikely hero, and he is backed up well by Kiefer Sutherland's maniacal act and William Hurt's confident change-of-pace. But Jennifer Connelly is pretty stale, and the villains seem to lose their dark creepiness at the start of the movie when the director tells us more about them and adds heartful purpose to their evil terrorism. The special effects aren't as good as people say, just fresh and new. The end battle sequence was really hilarious and I think it was louder than the end explosion sequence in Armageddon. But the story was magnificent, and the edge-of-your-seat mystery and thrills are surprising for a film nowadays. Highly recommended.",Dark City

When I saw the ""child"" Stranger, all I could think of was the midget that hangs around with Kid Rock. Lame. Everything about the film was just so amateurish. If it was trying to be Tim Burton'esquire in its appearance, it failed miserably. Kiefer Sutherland is an OK actor but he seemed like such an embarrassing caricature here and leads were like living dead.

Matrix ,Inception, and many other masterpieces all combined!",10,3 July 2015,"I'm so glad that I discover this movie which i downloaded in my laptop for months and never bothered watching it. I'm pretty sad that how could everyone watched Matrix, Inception, or even the Butterfly Effect but never heard of Dark City ( I was one of them)? Dark City is so underrated that I would even consider of being one of the best mystery/sci-fi movies I've seen so far in my life. I will try my best of not spoiling the plot of this movie because this is one of those mind-bending films. The movie starts off very confusing but interesting which drags you into the main character, John Murdoch, who has lost his memory but we never know how. The movie then leads you to an unexpected journey which reveals to you small clues and patterns that would eventually leads to a complete enigma.I am glad that they chose to set the background around the 1950s to 60s. It makes the perfect atmosphere which makes me associate with Zodiac, which is another great mystery/suspense movie. The vision is stylish and unique even though the whole movie is always dark (as the title). As to the special effects, I love how the director handle his imagination then reflects it into the movie, such as the twisting and moving buildings and the stunning visionary. However, I was quite pulled out a bit once it changes its settings, from suspense to sci-fi, which I somehow find it unrealistic. However, as a whole, the special effects are wonderful for the sake of being the movies produced in the late twentieth century.Another reason I love Dark City so much is its originality. You can actually see many miniatures of suspense masterpieces that were later on produced. I definitely see the Matrix, which was released a year after Dark City, and Inception which was released more than a decade! However, Dark City does have similarities to another movie which was another movie released in 1998 and I'm not gonna spoil it to you. As a whole, Dark City is very confusing but mind-bending, which I guess some people who hated it would say that it's a mess. However, I love how the direction of the movie goes. Because the director sets for the audience to explore the movies by themselves, there are always plot twists for the audience to experience throughout the movie and that's what made it so attracting. It has been so long that I saw a movie as great as Dark City; this movie really gives me chills. It's suspenseful; it's mind-blowing, and absolutely visually stunning (for a movie produced in 1998). I strongly recommend everyone to see this movie; this is one of the best suspense/mystery/ sci-fi movie I've seen. If I'm going to set Dark City on the scale in comparison with other mind-blowing movies, this is nearly as good as the Matrix and Inception (though they have better CGI and stuff), and is even better than The Butterfly Effect, Predestination, Interstellar, Triangle, Cube ,and so on. Please! Everyone go watch this movie even though it looks old and out-of-date just like how I thought before I watched it. I was actually so bored that I was digging from my old files and I glad I did! Dark City definitely worth a try!",Dark City
279,notevenwordshere,You are not who you think you are,10,22 November 2008,"Dark City is a masterpiece. Of what, though? Ah, that is not so difficult a question to answer.Alex Proyas is most famous for his rendering of The Crow, a noir-influenced comic book adaptation turned bloodfeast. Its rough, canted hues and heavy silhouettes focused that work into a study of the virtues of revenge and the vices of redemption. Fast-forward four years, and Proyas sheds the inbred angst in a quest to reinvent science fiction. What he has created is mature and frightening, a singular vision that should rightly be compared to such films as Fritz Lang's Metroplolis and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner.The plot begins with an introduction by Kiefer Sutherland: the Strangers, an alien race, are all but extinct, and in order to prolong their lives they are studying humans in hopes of unlocking the secrets to the eternal soul. Sound cheesy? That's because it is -- but then again, so was ""Blade Runner,"" with its replicants' difficulties grappling with a conscience. John Murdoch is the object of their obsession for the duration of the movie, as he has achieved the ability to ""tune,"" meaning he can reshape the physical world purely at will. But Murdoch's memory is murky -- he doesn't know whom to trust, if anyone. All he knows is that he needs to get to Shell Beach.The plot is pretty straightforward, simple and uncomplicated. But this movie is not self-contained like, say, The Matrix was; this is not a plot-driven hypothetical. Dark City is a vision, a cinematic language of noir imitating sci-fi and vice versa. It is complete in that it is a thorough visual treat: ominous, foreboding set pieces loom; and cityscapes blend and diverge. It is a world wholly unique yet still hauntingly familiar. It is a chamber drama, marrying existential paranoia with hardboiled mystery.So what kind of masterpiece is Dark City, really? A visual masterpiece? Certainly. But it's more than that. It's a reimagination of our world, and a new way to contemplate the dilemma of humanity -- as I heard it put in a song recently: ""Do you know where the self resides/ Is it in your head or between your sides?"" Proyas doesn't pretend to know or give the answer, but it might have something to do with Shell Beach.",Dark City
280,Chinook-3,New meaning to 'film noir',9,2 November 1998,Imagine an entire world where 'Film Noir' is a way of life. This intriguing mix of 1940's detective thriller and science fiction catches the spirit of the dark cult film almost perfectly.,Dark City
281,JasonL,"as good as Matrix, maybe better",10,4 April 2003,"I have seen lots of people compared Dark City with Matrix. They are quite similar in certain ways: both are about what is real and not real, both have a hero (in Matrix, Neo; in Dark City, John) with super power which can save the world, both have a mentor for the potential hero (in Matrix, Morpheus; in Dark City, the doctor), both have non-human forces controlling humans.One difference between them is Dark City put more emphasis on how John discovered the truth, while Matrix put more emphasis on how to overthrow the non-human forces (how to let Neo unlash his potential power), but the problem with Morpheus and his team is they do not really know how to do that, so finally Neo obtaining his power is attributed to the magic of love, which is not very satisfactory.Another good thing about Dark City is they depict a good scientist, which is relatively rare in sci-fi movies. Except in really ""scientific"" movies like Contact or 2001 Space Odyssey, scientists are quite often depicted as either mad dangeous weirdos. But in this movie, the doctor is the real hero, who has his own ideas, wisdom and courage, although he looks quite nerdy.The atmosphere of the movie is very dark for most of the time, somewhat reminding me of Blade Runner. At the end of the movie John changed the orientation of the floating land so that they get sunlight. That's a happy end.I like this movie. It makes you think. It discusses the relation of reality, memory and human nature and the possibility of chaning one's memories. The idea is creative while the way it is presented is clear, not as cryptic as Donnie Darko. Rate: 8 out of 10.",Dark City
282,1L19,This movie was LAME!,1,30 November 2000,"Yes, here you have it a world controlled by Aliens who can do ANYTHING....Yet a person is running away from them and they chase him with a floating knife and he gets away. Gimme a break! There was NO character development, boring dialog and a plot that probably should have been saved for a 10 page comic book.There was nothing nail biting or scary about this. There was no intrigue and there was no message. I keep feeling like I was in that fake city at the end of every episode of Mr Rogers Neighborhood but someone had turned the lights down a bit.I can't, for the life of me, figure out why anyone would like this movie, even after reading all the reviews.If I could give this movie a negative score I would but baring that it's definitely a 1 out of 10.",Dark City
283,fepp,Very nice Kafkaesque movie,9,18 March 2003,"This is a tremendous movie I must say!  Unfortunately I only got to watch it on a small poor TV, but the style and plot is still captivating.
The strongest point is a very nice style: 50-ish random big city, neither clearly American or European.  It is always dark, sun never shines, everything looks a bit run down.  Some puddles and rain reinforces the mood.
The start of the movie is wonderful in its total mystery; it is really a whole lot like a Kafka novel as the main protagonist walks around in a strange world discovering ever more of it. And it is really really strange in an absolutely wonderful way. The basic premise of aliens putting humans in a lab far out in space and messing with their minds is really nice, and the way they do it interesting enough.  However, I felt that the movie dropped some in its intensity when the mechanics behind the scenes get revealed.  An unseen horror is always more interesting than a seen horror. The end is a bit disappointing as it all digresses into a ""big fight"" in classic american style. But the final end is nice in that there is no complete happiness, only a hint that things could be getting better. Overall, better than most movies. An 9 out of 10!",Dark City
284,eskdale56,I keep coming back to this movie !,8,2 December 2006,"I loved The Matrix and this one is its match. I've now watched it 5-6 times in a couple of years and I still enjoy it. This movie has the feeling of a film noir (and if you noticed it tends to feature 1940s-1950s type architecture, dress and even automobiles and takes place in only dark nights in this unidentified city). William Hurt plays your classic Sam Spade 1950s flatfoot type. While this city is not known to be any particular city, it most resembles New York City in my mind.Kiefer Sutherland plays an interesting, almost quirky role--in the movie he has an odd way of speaking, somewhat accented and clipped speech. I'm not sure if he's attempting a German accent overlay on his English or something else, but his character is interesting...he is both a turncoat to the human race for his services to The Strangers and a turncoat to the the strangers when he helps Murdoch. The visual effects are stunning--a whole city that reconfigures itself before your eyes, yet this does not distract from the plot. Aliens that are creepy (at the same time they remind me of Uncle Fester on the Addams Family--perhaps the bald heads, long heavy coats, as well as the pallor and sunken eyes, but certainly not the personality!). All taking place in a city that seems to be in in eternal night.This movie is an intellectual one--not much on action, not much on blood & gore, but also one where the special effects are not the raison d'etre. Well worth watching.",Dark City
285,Shaf-2,An enchanting masterpiece,10,9 March 1999,"Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"" is perhaps one of the best science fiction movies ever made.  Enchanting and well-made in every aspect of its vision, the script is beyond intelligent, and the direction makes good use of perfect acting and grandiose special effects.To view this movie is to sit back in splendor as the secrets are revealed, one by one, piling on top of each other for the entire length of the plot, crecendoing to a climax that is as psychologically complex as it is just plain cool.  From the opening credits to the final shot, suspension of disbelief is automatic, and we become one with these characters and the strange lives they live.Enormously immersing and a great deal of fun, this is one not to miss.And on a sidenote, the absence of this film's name in the Oscar nominations is a travesty, particularly in the categories of Visual Effects and Art Direction.  It should have been a shoo-in to win both.",Dark City
286,jrabbit-2,Glossy FX try to compensate for a lack of creativity,1,26 July 1999,"I try to remain positive, to see the good in everything, and simply move on. But this film almost had me storming into the box office to demand my money back. There was no interesting dialogue. no characters developed beyond giving them a name and a quirky way of speaking, and the sci-fi element was only explored in it's most shallow form.WARNING!!! The text below may contain minor spoilers!!!WARNING!!!WARNING!!!My biggest beef with this film was the entire concept of Tuning. The villains had this power to bend reality, to literally make ANYTHING happen, yet every time they used their powers, they did so with a remarkable lack of creativity. They threw fireballs or daggers at one another. I mean, if you had god-like powers over reality, I think you and six of your friends could subdue a human on foot. Turn his legs to stone, have a cage drop on his head, turn the floor to glue, anything. Instead they just kept throwing things with their mind. BORING!All this wouldn't have been so bad, had there been something plot-wise to compensate. The action dragged on painfully slowly, the characters were all one-line descriptions of people, and the overall concept was full of holes. The movie even ends on an unresolved note.Basically, this movie tried to be what The Matrix actually was, but failed miserably.",Dark City
287,Leonidos,excellent,10,9 December 2000,I just recently saw this movie for the first time and wow.  The mood is somewhat dark but it only enhances the feel of the movie.  The one thing I must say is that the makers of The Matrix must have had this movie at the front of their mind when they wrote their script.SPOILERS!The hero has special powers but doesn't know it.He is pursued by powerful beings who all look basically alike and have the same special powers.The city that is the world for all the people living in it is a total fabrication.The strange beings keep the humans as unwitting prisoners so they can expierament on them without their knowledge.The hero gets help from a shadowy person who seems to know everything.The hero and the leader of the beings who run the city have a climactic battle using the strange powers they both have.,Dark City

Could have been a lot better film, but still a very good sci-fi film with mystery, fantasy should be added to its genre. That will help people to know what to expect!Despite saying all these, I am still rating it 8/10, because I liked the plot that much. And the execution was also great except for the climax leading to the end. A much thoughtful finish would have certainly enhanced the film.Recommending for Sci-Fi Lovers.",Dark City
289,thor5894,Some movies just don't age well,5,30 June 2014,"A few of the problems with Dark City: -Two-dimensional characters it's hard to care about or engage with. In the case of Rufus Sewell, he has the excuse that he's playing a character with no memory. But really there's not a single real person here, though William Hurt comes close.-Silly visual effects. The shape-shifting architecture was fine, but the Strangers floating thru the city, and worst, the laughable 'mind-battle' between Sewell and Ian Richardson at the end, oh dear.-One of the worst music scores I've ever heard. All swelling strings, telling you what emotion you should feel in every scene, ugh. I thought that went out of style in 1958.-Why does the city look like a 1940s film noir? Because the director thought it was cool? -The Strangers can manipulate things with their minds, yet they go around menacing people with knives?? Why not a gun then? I guess if they could have simply shot the hero, the movie would have been really short.-Um, did anyone notice that all the Strangers are men? Yo, menacing bald albino guys--want to know why your race is dying out? No women! How do you reproduce? I think, though, the real issue is that the movie just ages badly. It was much lauded when it was released, and Roger Ebert named it his Best Film of the Year. If I had seen it when it came out, I'm guessing I would have been a lot kinder. (I had a similar experience when I saw Fight Club, about ten years after it came out; it was good, but I didn't really understand all the hype.) Certainly it would seem that Dark City was a major influence on the television show Fringe, whose Observers were more or less a copy of its fedora-wearing mysterious bald guys. But there's just no emotional investment here. Once you learn that identities are constantly reset, along with memories, all of the human characters essentially become props. This kind of story works better in a shorter format; as an episode of The Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, it might have succeeded.",Dark City
290,HighlanderArg,Another one that makes the MAtrix fade...,9,25 January 2005,"""Dark City"" is a weird movie. Strange. It's some sort of sci-fi. The cast is headed by RUfus Sewell, and features Kiefer ""Jack Bauer"" Sutherland, Jenniffer Connelly, and William Hurt. It is specially the two men aforementioned that I was surprised of seeing in a movie like this.The director is Alex Proyas, a guy who gave us ""I, Robot"" and ""The Crow 3"". As in the last one, the ambient of the movie is dark. There is no sun, and some strange human-like creatures (I don't recall the name!) control people at will. Sewell sorts of escapes their control and is alone against everyone.This movie has just joined ""Nirvana"" in the group of ""better-than-the-Matrix"" films, providing an original script, and not a ""Terminator V"" would-be. THe FX are a whole different thing. Visually impressive, this movie kicks ass, and tarnishes even more the supposed originality of ""THe Matrix"".9/10",Dark City
291,gloshpit,Dark and complex sci-fi classic,8,27 January 2006,"When this movie first came out, I read some very good reviews of it, noted that it starred the rather lovely Jennifer Connelly, and never got round to watching it. Until recently, when I saw it on sale for £5, and snapped it up. This was A GOOD THING.The visual feel of the movie is the first thing that strikes you - grimy, dark, cold and completely foreboding. The city has an aura straight out of 40's and 50's Noir, with steaming alleys, dishevelled characters and anachronistic architecture. The second thing is the sheer dynamics of the editing. With an ASL of 1.8 seconds, the visuals bombard the viewer, and the dense plot perplexes until the layers are slowly stripped away to reveal the insidious plans of The Strangers.The story is taut, the acting is convincing and the aesthetics of the movie are quite fantastic, a film noir for the sci-fi age. I was told before seeing it that it was a great film, even if the last twenty minutes were ""a little too Dragonball Z"", an fairly accurate assessment of some of the shots, but not enough to denigrate from the movie overall. An underrated and overlooked sci-fi classic that anyone with an interest in solid film-making or dark expressionism simply must see.",Dark City
292,Leray97,Undeservedly underrated,7,29 June 2018,"With Blade Runner and The Matrix as Hollywood's two crowning achievements in its long line of misrepresentations of the cyberpunk genre in film, it seems like Dark City has been buried into obscurity for not being like the former, at least to the mainstream audience. It shouldn't be this way; while this film certainly isn't as stylish as the other two, Dark City presents a very cool take on the usual ""what's real and what isn't?"" idea that's usually seen in these cyberpunk sci-fi films. Going into any major detail of the its story would be stepping into spoiler territory but by the end of the film, I really was enraptured by its direction despite its execution (in style).A cyberpunk themed film's visuals is going to be one of its most important traits. The expected aspects are usually going to be something along the lines of holograms besides skyscrapers and neon lights enveloping the darkened city inhabited by people who were big trench-coats. Unfortunately, this isn't entirely the case in Dark City. Because of the overall story, the film will often look murky and just not pretty to look at (definitely not the best looking movie to watch during the daytime). Fight scenes are never fun to watch when it's hard to see anything that's happening; this film's darkened colors combined with the jerky camerawork during these sequences made them feel disorienting for me. At least this isn't an action movie on any major level. I was half expecting the filmmakers to make use of lights in some unique way, shape, or form to counteract the sheer darkness of the visuals but it never really happened. I'm not unhappy with this overall result though, due to the story's demands and possible budget constraints.Another popular cyberpunk attribute that isn't prevalent in Dark City is the music. It might be too much to ask this film to use the 80's style synthwave sound but seeing how it was released in 1998 and Blade Runner, having been released much earlier, featured a great synth soundtrack, I wish the filmmakers made the music a bigger priority here.The character performances were just okay. I only feel the need to mention the acting because I wanted a good segue to talk about how great Jennifer Connelly looks here: she looked great, maybe the budget for the lighting went towards her scenes. Kiefer Sutherland does this weird thing where he constantly breaks off his speech after every two to three words; I know this should be in reference to his character's frantic state of mind or something but it was annoying nonetheless.On questioning reality in a film, there are definitely better ways to do it and there are also worse ways. Dark City's take on this subject is both accessible and layered enough to make it undeserving of the negligence directed towards it these past years. It's definitely underrated but the film just isn't able to capitalize well enough on its own narrative unlike Blade Runner and The Matrix. Although if Hollywood were looking to remake another classic (and God knows they definitely are), I think Dark City could be a prime subject given its concept and prior restrictions.",Dark City
293,bross3,Unmet potential,6,5 November 1999,"Quite an engaging film with a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, the final quarter of the film just seemed like such a huge let-down.  It should have been exciting, but instead it just turned into absurdity.  (granted, I had suspended belief long before that point... it just jarred me into the ""yeah right"" state of mind at the end)Films like the Matrix have their share of plot holes (and then some)--but the Matrix is thoroughly entertaining throughout, if somewhat predictable. 
Dark City's acting is not especially good and the characters are fairly unmemorable.  The underlying premise is quite ingenious, but the plot seems to unravel at the end and tie things up a bit too easily.  The ""happily ever after"" tone of the end definitely seemed uncalled for.
Dark City tries to be profound but just leaves you with the feeling of dissatisfaction at what could have been a great film.(and no... I don't know how *I* would've ended it, either) :>",Dark City

When it was shown in theatres I passed it up easily, thinking it to be a weird, incomprehensible dark flick.  I was wrong.The movie is fantastic.  The concept is original and refreshing, as good as the Matrix, if not better.  The ideas are fun and mind boggling, much like Matrix was.  The acting was excellent, the characters portrayed their respective parts well and provided the film with believable events.If you have not yet seen this movie yet, I strongly suggest you go out and get a copy at your earliest opportunity.",Dark City
295,Andy-496,Have I been invited to use my brain at the pictures? I don't believe it!,9,7 October 1998,"I remember reading somewhere (it was one of the SF periodicals a couple of years back) that 'Dark City' was going to be a TV series. Obviously it isn't, but as a movie, it works incredibly well. I really enjoyed the dialogue, and I loved the mix of 50's nostalgia and 90's freak-outs. I think I need to watch it several times to check that the logic of the plot works (my memory is somewhat hazy), but what I did enjoy about the film was the strong sensation of being asked the question 'So what are you EXPECTING, exactly?'. Am I alone at laughing at the battle scenes? As I was almost completely unfamiliar with the film before I went to see it, a lot of the things took me by surprise, and it really held my attention. I'm not sure classifying it as Sci-Fi is entirely the way to go, but it's the closest we're going to get when we have to put up with absolute rubbish like Armageddon.I think I need to watch it again. And again. And again.In Summary: An underrated gem.",Dark City

A reasonably interesting story idea, and a bizarre set. What does it have going against it? Only a somewhat interesting story, and a bizarre set.  That's it.  The whole movie is familiar.  It is a large budget, version of a low budget B film from the early 80's.  The waves shooting from the guys head, what's with that?  His acting reminds me of Joey (from Friends).  This wasn't a bad movie, it was entertaining, but it was just too average.  For a similar type of movie that does a better job exploring this genre rent the Matrix instead.",Dark City
297,Haynerator,"""You Are Not Who You Think You Are""",8,9 March 2009,"A man wakes up in a bath tub, with absolutely no idea of who he is or how he got there. He soon finds himself accused of being a serial killer, and pursued by strange men with bright white faces. He sets out on a mission to find some answers; but before too long, he finds himself part of a much more sinister plot. Director Alex Proyas ('I, Robot', 'The Crow') directs this Burton/Gilliam-esquire portrayal of understanding the essence of being.This is very well compiled movie, with some great undertones to it. The opening is pretty gripping, in which a lot seems to happen and is somewhat subliminal in content. It is very fast paced, and erratically cut together so that it doesn't spend too long on each scene, this doesn't often give you time to consciously take in what happen, but the mind still registers what is going on. These erratic visuals make for an incredibly surreal opening; it is imperative that you allow yourself to suspend disbelief, and brace yourself for science-fiction mayhem. This setup is reflective of the protagonist 'Murdoch' (Rufus Sewell), being that neither the audience nor the main character understand what is going on at all. Lots of questions are asked, and it isn't until about 40 minutes in that the first question is vaguely answered.However, the length of time to answer even one question does not feel like a long time. Due to the pacing and the whole manner of execution in the first 40 minutes, it is easy to forget about time (considering you are at least accepting of such a genre of film). This is aided very well by some fantastically designed sets, lit perfectly to emulate the title and storyline of the film. Due to this, it is onerous to reference parts of the film without spoiling much of the plot.The plot is surprisingly deep for a film of its genre, with certain underlying themes as well as visuals which are slightly reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. It deals with the concept of what truly makes us human, and judges how unique we really are as a species. This is not only an aspect dealt with directly in the plot, but also has the potential to make you think about it too. The development of this plot is also superb, amidst the fast pace, the progression seems to be quite gradual. The acting talents were pretty inconsistent around this film, whilst there were some good performances; there were also some bad ones which detracted from the flow of the film at times. The film itself is remarkably gripping due to its pacing and visual intensity. But the acting takes you out of this. In particular, Kiefer Sutherland; while his character is a pretty strong and solid character, Sutherland just simply isn't convincing in his role. He seems to be trying too hard to be disparate to the roles he has performed before, as if trying to set himself up as a character actor, but unfortunately he fails with horrid consequences. Jennifer Connelly is also fairly mediocre; she gives a fairly bland, empty performance and is somewhat disappointing. Despite this, when the acting's good...It is really good; Richard O'Brien for one gives a fantastic performance as a darkly sinister villain, whilst also adequately incorporating his much loved element of camp behaviour. Rufus Sewell shines too, in the beginning he seems fairly unsure, but as the film goes on he gradually emerges to give a very interesting and plausible performance. Similarly, William Hurt gives a great performance too. These performances make for some good tension and suspense throughout; being that the plot is quite secretive in its build-up, it is hard to predict some actions as the film moves along.While there are some great visuals in cinematographic terms, as well as good performances and an intriguing story; there are some parts of the script which don't seem to fit, being that certain parts of dialogue are quite cheesy, in a bad sense. The line ""I have Murdoch in mind"" (which doesn't make sense here) is quite a paltry piece of speech. When watching the film it will be obvious why it has been noted.The special effects are also quite enjoyable, but they start to become overused by the end of the film. The climax to this film is somewhat a little dissatisfying and predictable, at which point tension and suspense becomes negligible. It is a surprising climax to have given the nature of the rest of the film, and due to the content of the climax, it is also somewhat tedious in its execution and brings the film down substantially. However, after this there is a great final scene in a visual sense.Overall, this film is pretty entertaining and not a typical film of the sci-fi genre. This is definitely one for fans of the genre, especially those who enjoyed 'Brazil' or 'The Matrix'. With some great performances, and a generally good script this is a highly entertaining and engaging film which requires some brain power to follow (which is often refreshing with a film of this style). This is 8 out of 10, unique, creative and visually enthralling. It is also heavily suggested that it be viewed in a darkened room for optimal impact.",Dark City

Not only is this a great sci fi movie but it is a great movie of the heart. Visually stunning and spooky it looks like something straight out of Tim Burton's imagination. The story's premise is that an alien race is trying to figure out the essence of man ie their soul. They have created their own city in which to study people. One man wakes up from the dream world and he is soon helped by a doctor played very well by Mr. Sutherland. The journey is well worth it for any Sci Fi fan.

Instead the whole idea just dragged along to a predictable conclusion.Oh and for you pretentious fanbois who say that it was overshadowed by the Matrix, save your money and buy a clue.

303,Pluto-3,Nearly Perfect Film,9,5 August 1998,"I saw Dark City about 5 times now and it has clearly mind-blown me. Of course the FX are astounding (especially the end battle which is epic) but mostly the whole concept of the film. It's scary, troubling and Alex Proyas did a marvelous job in bringing a dark and paranoïd style to the film. I love almost everything about the film except one thing: we are told everything! Whenever there's a question in your mind about the mystery, a character will at one point or the other explain it in a long monologue. Mr. Proyas should have watched a little more X-Files episodes and learn that some mysteries are more mysterious if they are unresolved. I would have loved to be left with some questions to anwser by myself or among friends. Anyway, you MUST see this film, especially if you like comic books, video games or fantasy films. You'll freak out over the end battle. Rarely can I say that I've been moved that much by a sci-fi movie but this one is THE one to see. I wish I had a DVD because the DVD version has tons of cool featurettes to enjoy the movie even further. Until then, I'll enjoy the tape. And so should you.",Dark City
304,Mike-489,"What if everything we remember never happened, but someone wanted to make us think it did?",10,24 May 1999,"A superb cast, a thought provoking story, action, special effects... what more can you ask for? The story is definitely ""out there"", no pun intended (see the sequence towards the end where the truth behind the city's existence is revealed) & very original.How to describe it's look? Some have said ""Blade Runner meets The Crow"" but I think a better way would be to say that ""Hellraiser meet Terry Gilliam in 1950s Chicago"". Certainly The Strangers bear more than a passing resemblence to Clive Barker's Cenobites, down to the clicking teeth & the tendency to draw sharp blades along the wall as they close on their terrified prey.But this film ploughs it's own furrow not only in terms of it's story line, but also between the 2 possible extremes of style in such a manner that I found it hard to fault. It's not too lightweight, avoiding the all too easy option of relying on special effects to entertain, while similarly avoiding becoming too heavy & obscure enough to confuse the audience & fail to get the plot across. If only other film makers could learn from this there would be a lot less rubbish filling our cinema screens!I did think that William Hurt's police inspector was a little too easily persuaded by Rufus Sewell's explanation, although being able to levitate objects would, I admit, be rather startling evidence of something!Also the ending is a little twee, that's only to be expected as the forces of good prevail. But again it avoided being grossly overdone & the hint of bitter sweetness keeps it in tune with the rest of the film (Rufus Sewell doesn't get the girl in the end, but all is not lost, etc., etc.)Keep an eye out for Richard O'Brian as one of the Strangers. Needless to say he plays the un-hinged one & does it very well! Ian Richardson is equally sinister as MR. Book, leader of The Strangers, using his ability to be about as warm as a cold, dead fish to good effect.",Dark City
305,Falkeep,Dark City vs. The Matrix,8,10 October 2000,I liked the Matrix a great deal but I much prefer this dark vision from Alex Proyas... the genius behind the film version of The Crow.  I think Proyas took more chances and relied more on the intelligence of his audience than on the Matrix's eye-candy.  As for why I mention both of these movies together... they are the same story.  Watch Dark City and then watch The Matrix and I defy you to come up with a single significant plot difference between the two.  Any takers?,Dark City
306,Madluke91,The City in the sky.,7,19 February 2009,"First of all i must warn that this review will contain spoilers, so be forewarned:I just watched this movie, which was released in 1998 and i hadn't even heard of until now in 2009! I do believe it is fair to say that this film is under the radar for a lot of people.I have to say this movie suits me perfectly; i often say when i am asking for recommendations that the perfect movie for me is a semi-surreal movie, kind of similar in that respect to A Clockwork Orange, and no i am not under any illusion; this is nothing like a clockwork orange, but it does have that semi-surreal feel to it. The dark figures, non-human like, the surreal, fantasy like city. When i first put the film on, i was almost watering at the mouth, the film seemed very promising from the start; the awesome soundtrack, produces the 'correct' atmosphere throughout: epic at times, eerie at others, dark at others, but always seeming not out of place. Then as the film evolves, you do get deep into the plot; it makes you think, you care about the characters, and most importantly of all, it sticks with you. If i do have any negative points it would be these. Rufus Sewell is one of my least favourite actors, and i mean out of any in the world. I have never been fond of him, and in this film also his performance for me isn't great. The overall point though is that i didn't really like the casting; there wasn't really a standout performance for me. However the film is so well directed and the idea is so unique, that i found this pushed to the back of my mind as i just sat back and enjoyed the film from beginning to end. I also was left thinking if only. If only this film had a larger budget!! This film as i have previously mentioned suits my tastes almost perfectly, and i couldn't help but to imagine what this film could have been on a larger budget. Putting this aside, the film is well made, but it does have a cheap feel/look to it. I could imagine, and did want, this to be a masterpiece, but due to its budget in my opinion, the film just lacked little bits and pieces. But stepping away from the negative, i do have to say that i thoroughly enjoyed the film, will probably watch it again, and would recommend it to anyone, not just someone looking for, like me, a film with a semi-surreal feel. If i was to compare this film to another film, i would have to say imagine The Truman Show. There are many differences, but the whole life is a lie, controlled, even made, by another is all here. Its one of those films i will say to anyone, watch it once. It might not be for everyone, but it is certainly worth watching once.",Dark City
307,litpics,A Dark Classic,10,18 February 2004,"The problem with science fiction anymore is the increasingly unoriginal concepts that are up and coming. Instead, remaking or reinstating old classics. Not so, the case with Dark City. Probably one of the most overlooked films of our time, Dark City tells the tale of a man who wakes in a world with no memory of what is going on around him. In essence, we are in the same boat. He goes through searching for clues and trying to survive the touch of the Strangers, a race that houses more purpose to these people than they could possibly know. With the help of their human doctor, they conduct experiments. Our hero jumps in to not only understand them but to free us all. Your first thought in seeing this movie is probably, 'Wow, how similar this is to The Matrix.' With exception to the fact that it came out before The Matrix ever graced it's previews, there are similarities. I have said many times to people, this is how the other two should have ended up. Hey, if your going to take something, may as well take it all. Anyway, moving on. Dark City is brilliant. The action sequences alone are suspenseful, and to this day I watch and pick up new things. Note that there are spirals throughout all of the film. Also, the acting. A good sci-fi must perpetuate good acting in order to sell this fiction as a possible reality. To start, Rufus Sewell, a fine thespian indeed. Not only does he sell the newborn man, but he also makes you feel a certain sense of sorrow for him. Next on the plate is the ever great William Hurt. I can say that I've only seen a handful of films he's been in, but anytime I do, he is phenomenal. Dark City is no exception. He plays the inspector, bent on finding a killer but realizes the case has nothing to do with this life. Next comes Kiefer Sutherland, a fantastic choice for this film indeed as the Igor mad scientist. What you come to find out is that he is helping the enemy because he has no choice. The work Kiefer does with his voice takes you to a different thought process of who it is, making you feel sorry for his character more than Sewell's. Fourth down the line comes the lovely Jennifer Connelly, now an academy award winner, and rightfully so. She shines as much as she can in this sci fi feature where she plays a smaller role than people think. And last, but certainly not least, comes Mr. Richard O'Brien. He redefines what the term evil villain means. His vocal work, though not sure if it's his voice or an imitation, is superb. I can't go a day without thinking of high pitched voice as he spouts the line ""We use your dead as vessels"", and then a snarl. All in, one of the better films in history, I would definitely place this on my top ten list.10 out of 10.",Dark City

310,Greg Lord,A stunning cyber-punk visual tour-de-force,9,18 April 2000,"Directed by Aussie Alex Proyas (The Crow') & with an all-star & very British cast including Rufus Sewell, William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connolly, Ian Richardson & Mr. Rocky Horror' himself, the great Richard O'Brien, Dark City' is a moody, spectacular & visually stunning cyber-punk' sci-fi thriller.It reminds me of a very good dance track put together by a top DJ using loads of samples from many older & diverse tracks. Although borrowing inspiration from & copying the work of others the DJ, using his skill & creativity, messes around with then mixes the individual samples together, adds his own touches, & shapes it all into something that exceeds the sum of it's parts & takes on an entirely new identity of it's own.So it is with this film: borrowing/sharing ideas from (for instance) the original Star Trek' TV series, Michael Moorcock's The Dancers at the End of Time' books, films such as Blade Runner' & The City of Lost Children', & more recent films The Truman Show' & The Matrix'; Dark City' has very little that I haven't seen before in some way or other, but it manages to mesh it's disparate strands into an end product that is fresh, original & highly entertaining.The eponymous dark city, unbeknown to it's population, is ruled over by mysterious cadaverous beings known only as The Strangers'. These beings have the power to reshape matter at will with the help of great machines underneath the city, a process they call tuning'. Every day at the same time they put everyone in the city to sleep in order to retune' their city environment & reprogram their memories, with the help of psychiatrist Dr. Schreber (Sutherland).Occasionally a city inhabitant wakes up while he is being reprogrammed' & realises the awful truth, usually leading to madness &/or death. John Murdoch (Sewell) however is different - not only does he escape when he awakes but he somehow himself gains the ability to tune'. In their determination to capture him the Strangers not only chase him themselves but also frame him for a series of vicious murders. Meanwhile Murdoch is desperately trying to find Shell Beach' - a place of which everyone knows but for which they can never quite remember the directions. He vividly remembers spending his childhood there & feels that if he can find it he can escape to freedom.Plotwise there isn't an awful lot else to it  will the Strangers &/or the police find Murdoch - & if so can he fight them off  or will he find his mythical Shell Beach & escape? Is there a way to defeat the Strangers? And exactly what is the dark city' anyway?As good as all this is, where this film really excels is stylistically & visually: in those regards this is one of the most amazing films that I have ever seen  the designs, the sets, the costumes, the special effects & the film's overall look & feel are simply stunning. There are images here that are I think some of the most striking in cinema history.
I enjoyed this film immensely  for sheer visual impact & atmosphere it's hard to beat, & the Strangers are some of the most flesh-crawlingly creepy villains I've ever seen. Although I found the plot to be somewhat inconsistent, there's enough to maintain interest, & there's a great surprise or 2 towards the end.Overall Dark City' is a very rich & rewarding experience, & one that I can thoroughly recommend.",Dark City

314,nitehawk-8,I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time.,9,15 June 1999,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in an eerie hotel, naked and in the bathtub, with no memories and blood on his forehead. (I couldn't imagine a more strange and frightening experience.) The ring of the hotel phone breaks the silence-- a strange man on the other end tells him he must leave because there are people looking for him. Many events such as this one unfold in Dark City, where ""man has no past... and humanity has no future"".Dark City has been passed over by so many critics it's depressing. I think that it should at least have been up for ""original screenplay"" or SOMETHING at the Oscars to reward Alex Proyas for his fantastic vision. I fail to see why so many people label this movie ""noir"" like it's BAD or something. Being dark and twisted is not a crime, and despite some other people's comments, this movie is NOT just for the trenchcoat-wearing masses (or if it is, maybe the rest of you can learn something from Goths). If you like sci-fi, dark plots and having reality be so well distorted that you don't realize it IS, so you will love Dark City. (People who have seen the Matrix BEFORE this movie MUST see it, it is very similar in these three respects).I gave it a 9 out of 10 ONLY because I thought the ending fight scene was a bit weak. Great for a fight scene, but because the rest of the movie focuses on John Murdoch's quest to discover his past and the eerie, ominous happenings in the city, the climax seemed hastily thrown together, as if the crew all of a sudden remembered they had a deadline to meet and could no longer continue the plot in the previous fashion.The visuals in this movie were absolutely stunning. The effects were NOT used to substitute for the plot, like other movies such as Starship Troopers, Lost in Space and Alien: Resurrection. They were used only as needed and were breathtaking. The editing is NOT as choppy as is rumored, it only lends to the power of the movie. There are some heart-stopping images in Dark City. Watch for the Strangers' clock, views of the city and John's memories.Proyas takes ideas and ambience from many other movies but integrates them all neatly into Dark City. Gotham City is clearly seen as is Metropolis and other influences such as Ed Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" dominate in the diner scenes. The forty-ish era (yet strangely futuristic) city is known to be populated, and yet it is ominously empty (hence one of Hopper's main themes, isolation in large cities). (It's especially quiet at midnight, hehehehe... ;D ) This 40's era ambience together with the sci-fi fantasy undercurrent makes for a very interesting feeling while watching.I'm happy that Kiefer Sutherland, Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror fame) and William Hurt agreed to do this movie, it gave Dark City just that much more validation in the USA (I wish things weren't like this, but they are). Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful and convincing as the doctor/scientist Dr.Schreber, and Rufus Sewell is a properly confused yet determined John Murdoch. Many critics say that William Hurt's character, the detective, and Jennifer Connelly's Emma Murdoch could have used a little more development, but I think part of the point of Dark City was that you don't really know who people are (not to mention yourself). Richard O'Brien and his character's whole race creep me out every time I see the movie, but he's especially frightening and a strange character. I had to resist the urge to talk like a Stranger after seeing the movie a few times.Trevor Jones, one of my favorite movie composers, did the score for Dark City, and I must say it's very apropo. The deep, bass vocals and frantic themes are some of my favorite aspects, but ""Memories of Shell Beach"" is a haunting, beautiful song as well. Some of my other favorite scores by him are the Dark Crystal and Last of the Mohicans.Altogether, I think Alex Proyas had a stroke of genius in the making of this movie. One of the most original dark sci-fi movies I've seen in a long time. It deserves its place with the Matrix, 12 Monkeys and others, pioneers in a field so changed (usually for the worse) since Star Wars and since earlier sci-fi classics. I hope these won't be the last of a (dare I say it?) dying race of movies that have true creativity and originality.",Dark City
315,callipygian,An audio visual feast,10,5 November 2002,"Dark City completely blew me away. As the credits started to roll and the lights came up in the house, I could hardly move as I noticed how heavily I was breathing. This film was like an orgasm for the senses. The cinematography, mood, music and ambience easily equaled that of ""The Crow"" and ""City of Lost Children"". Unfortunately, this film lacked in just about every other category.

Somewhat of a moodier & less technical perspective of ""the Matrix"". Where I can see some similarities.  They both are also very different. I saw this in a double bill with ""The Matrix"" and it is an excellent combination! It is also an excellent combination of science fiction & mystery.

Kieffer Sutherland is at his best playing either villains or creeps (Freeway, A Time to Kill, Eye for an Eye) and his unhinged performance in Dark City is no exception.

318,Matt-33,Dark City vs. The Matrix,10,20 July 2000,"I've seen a lot of comments comparing ""Dark City"" to ""The Matrix.""  Well, in my opinion ""The Matrix"" is based off ""Dark City.""  Here is the proof: Characters: Neo=John Murdoch, Morpheus=Dr. Schreiber, The Agents=The Strangers Plot: In both movies, humans are living in a world that isn't what what they think it is.  Humans are being used to the benefit of the villian.  The machines in ""The Matrix"" need humans for energy, while The Strangers in ""Dark City"" need humans as an experiment to discover ""the soul.""  Both villians need humans to survive. Scenes: -The first time we see Neo/John they wake up. -Neo/John receive phone calls from Morpheus/Dr. Schreiber warning them of The Agents/The Strangers. -There are three Agents coming for Neo, there are three Strangers coming for John. -Neo/John both discover that the world they thought was real, isn't.  Neo wakes up in the harvest tank, John breaks down the wall of the city. -Neo/John both have powers greater then that of any other character in the film. -Agent Smith/Mr. Hand both have different ideas then their collegues.  Agent Smith wants to leave the Matrix.  Mr. Hand injects himself with John's memories in order to learn what it's like to be human. -Both films have a final showdown between the hero and villian. Neo vs. Agent Smith, John vs. Mr. Book -Both films end with a conversation between hero and villian.  Neo to the machines, John to Mr. Hand.I'm sure there are even more similarities that I have not yet found out about.  But this should give you something interesting to think about.",Dark City

323,gscheyd,"great style, mediocre movie",5,14 June 2006,"Roger Ebert's pick for the best film of 1998, Dark City is not without merit, but ultimately is deficient in too many important respects for me to seriously entertain it as the best film of the year, particularly in a year that produced as many great films as 1998 did (Happiness, Shakespeare in Love, and Saving Private Ryan foremost among them). What the movie does have going for it is style. Careful attention is paid to maintaining the dark atmosphere without sacrificing beautiful textures and colors (unlike Tim Burton's Batman which failed in exactly this respect) and it contains many wonderful shots, particularly in the first ten minutes. The special effects team did a fine job with something we do not often see  architecture effects. The casting of Richard O'Brien (The Rocky Horror Picture Show) as Mr. Hand was inspired, but Kiefer Sutherland's acting, quite frankly, is bad. (That's just true in general, but it's particularly apparent in this role.) The dialogue has moments of hokiness, which would be bad enough in an old MGM musical, but in a modern thriller are positively unforgivable. If ever I should be abducted and brainwashed by a master race of telekinetic wizard aliens, my one hope is that they are not the sort of telekinetic wizard aliens who speak in puns. Proyas, the writer has chosen a interesting fact upon which to base the story, namely, that memories necessarily have a specific neurological underpinning, and it is therefore possible for people to have very clear memories of things that never, in fact, occurred. Thence he takes the story in an interesting direction. The plot is adequate, even good at times, and the film is mostly internally consistent in adhering to its sci-fi rules; but the creation of new memories is depicted as rather sloppy, and the fact that people are not implanted with the memories of daylight and/or how to get to Pebble Beach makes no sense within the context of the storyline. It can only be understood as a device to prevent the story from bogging down, and that is not the hallmark of a great film, and certainly not of the film of the year. It scooped The Matrix in its depiction of a lone human who can succeed in overthrowing a regime of tyrannical oppressors by virtue of his acquired omnipotence within their world. It is always interesting to see how restrained writers can be after granting their character the ability to do anything, literally anything, but our protagonist here, John Murdock, (unlike The Matrix's Neo or The Neverending Story's Bastian) is saved by not having to bear the writer's burden of his character's omnipotence through a sequel or two.

325,paul-heys-im,Future-Noir,7,10 November 2012,"Firstly, I'd like to talk about one of my favourite topics, these days, current era Doctor Who. I promise you, I'll make it brief. Most of you are aware about my feelings to what the state controlled BBC have done to our good Doctor, essentially killing everything that was good about the show. Word on the street is that DW showrunner, Steven Moffat, is some kind of super hot, super genius, super slick, all round super shizzle who as taken DW to new peaks and beyond. Far too many people are hailing him as the best thing since sliced bread, Christ, or even, Tarantino. Now I'll explain to you (by using this film as an example) why this is a complete crock of baloney, and as I have said all the way down the line, Lord Steven Moffat, is a fraud. When Moffat took the helm of the show, anybody with half a braincell could see that things had taken a turn for the worst, but despite this, I persevered and was told, it would be more than worth my while, once I got a load of the new evil genius scary villains, created by Moffat, the most freaked out, sinister creatures since the Daleks, The Silents. Apparently, these new, epically awesome bad guys would do for current era Who what the Daleks had done for the show, all those years ago, back in 1963. We were told that these bad guys would have the kid's hiding behind sofa's, and grannies clutching their hearts in fear, once they were introduced. And lo and behold, upon their arrival, people swore upon their own mother's tomb's that these new Who villains were the bomb, outright terrifying and the most original monsters this side of the cosmos, all hail Steven Moffat. Had I seen Dark City, prior to that point, I would have had all the proof I needed to shut the Moffat fanboi's up, once and for all. alas, I had not. But, as they say, the worm turns, and karmic justice is upheld. You see, the fact of the matter is, Mr Moffat, supergenius, stole The Silents design directly from this movie, even down to the gurgling sounds The Stranger's make throughout Dark City. Way to go Steven, plagerism at it's best. I hope you are so proud of yourself, you massive fraud and cheat. The cheeky blighter that is Steven, even had the audacity to directly rip off the Stranger's reality altering abilities. So you see Moff-head's, your lord and master is not a genius at all, he is just a blatant art thief whose best design was stolen from a creature from Dark City, which is far better realised than Mr Moff could ever produce.Now, on to the film itself. Without a doubt, the cinematography of DC is astounding, an absolute beauty to behold, even 12 years later (take note Moff-heads, that's a full ten years before Steven belched out The Silents). Director Alex Proyas' intricate use of greens, reds and browns is lush, and jaw- dropping to see in action. It hearkens back to the days of the 1940's film- Noir's I adore so much, even down to the aesthetics of the vehicles and buildings. Job well done, Alex. Without spoiling the plot, which isn't too shabby either, the film plays out sort of like a cross between The Matrix, which this film was overshadowed by somewhat due to the fact they came out almost at the same time, Carpenters ""They Live"" and, even a bit of Cronenberg's ""Scanners"" thrown in for good measure. All in all, it plays out very nicely indeed, a few twists here and there along the way, you may, or may not, see coming. It is genuinely intriguing and creepy, and will hold your attention for it's two hour running time. I have to admit, I found my interest waning slightly around 2/3d's into the film, but when the plot picked up for the third act, I was more or less, firmly hooked for the finale, which, considering what we have seen in these latter years, some may consider a tad underwhelming. However do not let that spoil your enjoyment of the film. The way it looks and it's unique concept are worth the asking price alone. The acting is all above par, with even a minor role from the guy who plays Rick in The Walking Dead, just to tempt you U.S series fans out there. This film as been totted as a cinematic masterpiece, is this true? No. In all fairness it isn't. However it is a very engaging, suspenseful 120 minutes you will not be disappointed with. It s definitely above average. It is also a film that makes you think, and question the world around you, and we don't get half as many of those these days, as us cinema buffs would like.",Dark City
326,raahul16,Best underrated movie ever,10,30 June 2014,"This is definitely one of the best sci fiction movies made ever. undoubtedly the best story for a sci fiction movie.Movie characters are so well itched and combination of some great acting.After some decades this movie will be remade. Only, if the movie was made with better graphics it could have been the blockbuster.Darkness always work. Humans do evolve best in the time of darkness.Lookout for the ending scene, it gives the feeling of rejuvenation.P.s: It's a human heart which makes the difference not brain.",Dark City
327,andrewhanes,I just got back from Shell beach,9,1 January 2021,"I feel that the only way to make sense of the story is to give the most single/blatant review.This movie is about a man who wakes up amnesiac and finds himself not only accused of multiple kills but with a detective and the police, a woman who says is his wife and a group of mysterious men who are called the Strangers hunting him.I first heard this because of a bin of nerd-shiet I acquired (amongst it books and legos') and saw the movie VHS release date and thought it was a murder mystery all thorough. No blame on the tagline but it's 23% like that. The rest is sci/fi and gothic where it does have a 'mystery' but the ending is all-out balls-out explosive (pun intended) and feels a bit random with the use of powers, but nothing that the story, actors, music, CGI, costumes and production design make up with.People have seen and said director Alex Proyaz best movie is the crow and else after is downhill but I think this after goes down(?)",Dark City
328,meadever,"Better Than ""The Matrix""",9,19 July 2017,"To be clear, I don't hate ""The Matrix"". It's just never been my cup of tea, and I thought it was somewhat overrated. This film, on the other hand, is not only an obvious influence on that later film, but in my opinion, superior. The story is truly imaginative, and I don't say that lightly. It's not something seen in every Summer blockbuster, which is refreshing. The fact that they use a film-noir aesthetic to tell that story makes it even better. The colours, the shots, the pacing, the design, it all combines to make one of the most perfect examples of that genre ever put on screen. Of course, there is the twist of the science-fiction elements, but as can be seen in ""Blade Runner"", these two concepts are not mutually exclusive. To the contrary, they can work quite well together when done right. And they were done right here. The acting adds to the experience, as well. Rufus Sewell is wonderful, as he usually is, and Richard O'Brien was the most perfect choice for the character of Mr. Hand. But the character that really stuck out to me was Dr. Schreber, played to perfection by Kiefer Sutherland. He really steals the show with his Peter Lorre-esque portrayal of the good doctor. It proves Sutherland's acting range, as this role is worlds away from his confident turn as David in ""The Lost Boys"", as well as his role as Jack on ""24"". Each actor seems devoted to their part, and it makes this fantastical adventure all the more immersive. If I had to criticise anything, there are only two items of note. First, the costumes of the villains (Strangers, as they are called in the movie) are incredibly close to those of the Cenobites in ""Hellraiser"". It adds to the menace, but it is also mildly distracting. Second, the final few minutes are just this side of hackneyed. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that while it's not a bad ending at all, there are moments that feel slightly tacked-on. However, neither of these things is enough to take away from the overall quality of the film. It was obviously well thought out, and a lot of work went into it. It is sadly underrated for whatever reason, but if you haven't seen this movie, I strongly encourage you to do so as soon as possible. It was truly ahead of it's time, and its influence can be felt in films to this day. There is so much that this movie does right that make it a true joy to experience.",Dark City
329,IcePirat,High praise for the best film of 1998,10,8 December 1998,"I loved this movie for several reasons.  This was easily the film that I most enjoyed this year.  One of the interesting things was that during the film I had no inclination to look at my watch and say geez! this is a long movie, but afterward, I said geez! that movie was much longer than the hour and a half that I spent in the theater.  It was just that engrossing.  The originality of it was a lot of what made it so great for me.  I am not saying that every part was original (the sun never came out in Blade Runner either), but the way in which it was put together was very stimulating. This movie will absolutely be my first purchase on DVD.  Down with divx!",Dark City

Actually, let me re-phrase that, this is one of the strangest, original, and best movies I've seen in a while.  It has an interesting plot, a great feel, and it will keep you guessing until the end (in response to the question, what's going on here?).  I thought it was good, but it's not for everybody.

It is a visual stunning film but the movies real asset is its terrific plot.  It stays deliberately vague at the beginning and it forces you pay attention and focus on the plot- not the special effects.  This film is a modern day masterpiece.  George Lucas lost his vision in making the ""Phantom Menace"", he should view this film and it may put his priorities back in line; plot first, then special effects.",Dark City

333,Mr. Tobar,"Beautiful visuals, plot fell a little short.",7,9 October 2000,"The cinematography is beautiful in this film.  It has a dark visual edge to it, and every scene has a vividness to it that reminds me of Technicolor. The plot line runs a little thin, as it amounts, in the end, to be little more than a Twilight Zone episode; but you know that from the start, and with the suspense building all along, it's hard not to get sucked into the plot, shallow though it is.There's a lot of very cool imagery in the film, both visually, and symbolically.  The psychological implications are great, for those of us that are philosophically/psychologically inclined.  With a little bit more of a creative twist to the plot, or maybe even just a little darker edge to the ending, I would have rated this one a classic.  As it is, I still highly recommend it.",Dark City
334,danhall86,An underrated sci-fi/noir masterpiece,9,15 December 2014,"I sat down to watch this film (Director's Cut) with my girlfriend just last night. I've seen it numerous times, but I was curious what her reaction to the film might be. It's hard for me to talk much about DC itself without giving much away. It's one of those films that's best appreciated when going in with no knowledge of the film at all, for Dark City will throw you some ingenious red herrings, some delightful moments of foreshadowing and some jaw-dropping twists throughout its running time. As I expected, for the first 20 minutes of the film, she seemed genuinely uncomfortable with it. Those rapid cuts, the vague production design that gives no specific idea of time or setting, the slowly growing impression that you're watching a detective thriller and then *BAM* - the first twist hits, and you have no idea what you're watching again. That is ingenious, edge-of-the-seat film-making.Dark City is marvellous. It takes the viewer on a journey quite unlike anything I've ever seen. And all a year before The Matrix came along and scooped up all they credit (they even used the same sets!) The acting here - while having received some criticism - is all top notch in my book, and by the time the credits roll, you'll be amazed at the total transformation the characters and story have made since those opening shots. It has suspense, action, mystery, horror, romance and pretty much everything in between. The only negativity I could draw attention to is the weak final fight, which feels like it needed more budget to become fully realised. She seemed quite surprised as the film came to a close with those beautiful sunny shots that contrast so starkly with the rest of the film. Dark City was actually pretty damn good.",Dark City

Very impressive , this is definitely way better than The Matrix ,IMHO.   Originality is the key point to the core of our curiosities. And what surprises us is how much we can relate to the story, sway with the story, and also get entertained by the story, inspired by the story...There is really much less to say about how much I like this flick, It's got every element that I fancy about :DARK ,SUSPENSE ,SCI-FI ,THRILLER , SEXUAL ELEMENT , ACTION , MYSTERY , ALIEN ,FANTASY...I don't know much about the CAST in this flick , but I can say this is definitely the best cast ever .Everyone in this flick gave us an extraordinary performance , and I started to get to know them since.

336,zzzac-873-166168,The Greatest Sci Fi Movie Of The Last 2 Decades,10,4 February 2011,"This movie is like a dark super hero film. John Murdoch( played by Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a bath tub, in a city with no sun,and he has ammniesa. He discovers he is wanted for murders he did not commit. Frank Bumsteade( a detective played by William Hurt) persues John and ends up helping him. He also has a wife named Emma(Jennifer Connelly). She is desperately trying to find him, because their in some sort of affair. These mysterious cloaked beings called ""The Srangers"" are the main villains and are lead by Mister Book. They have telepathic abilities(called TUNING) and are beings from another planet. John Murdoch has also developed the ability to tune. Every 12 hours the strangers shut down the city and the buildings shift and grow. During this time, every one in Dark City falls asleep, except the strangers and John Murdoch. No one is ever aware of the changes made. Murdoch is freaked out by this. He meets his supposed family members, but no one seems to know anything. The romance between Sewell and Connelly is so realistic, you would swear they were lovers in real life. I wont spoil the ending, but for such a DARK movie it has a happy and BRIGHT ending.This film suppasses The Matrix, Inception, Avatar and Minority Report. The only sci fi movie better is Star Wars. This is the most under rated, un appreciated sci fi of all time, it has done a lot believe it or not. Some believe this movie inspired The Matrix, which was released one year later. The two movies have very similar characteristics, the characters, story, and cinematography. But Dark City surpasses all modern Sci Fi films. Not even Inception can stand up to it. The ending is incredible and the acting is superb. The sad part is no one knows about this unique film. If The Matrix gets 8.7, Than Dark City gets 10/10. Don't get me wrong I liked The Matrix, but Dark City is just better. This is a must see for Sci Fi fans and movie lovers alike. I think it would be cool if Alex Proyas rerealesed this movie in 3D. Buildings popping off the screen would be awesome. Shouldn't be missed, see it man, its awesome! Dark City 10/10 Best Sci Fi of the last 2 decades.",Dark City

Share very good shooting and visual effects, as well as very good actors. The freaks who run Dark City are particularly original. Jennifer Connely is perfectly beautiful. Rufus Sewel has done this traumatic role very well. On the other hand, the only flaw and the beauty of it is the naivety of connecting the human heart to his emotionality. And they did not clarify whether they were brought here from the real world and how these people could be here.",Dark City
338,ozborovac,A nice day to start again,7,5 December 2017,"The nineties were a veritable treasure trove of horror-tinged, philosophical sci-fi dystopias that simply couldn't say no to the allure of high octane action-thrillers. It's like Kierkegaard joined the X-games, and John Woo is the directing the whole thing. It's like a hefty chunk of existential angst crept into the creative marrow of an entire decade. Something of an underground hit, Dark City remains of the more stalwart examples of imaginative sci-fi film-making during the Clinton years. Having finished the more Gothic intoned The Crow, director Alex Proyas decided that his next project would give tribute to noir films, as well as some of the heady concepts found in the books of Phillip K. Dick (Would you call them Dick-y concepts? Dickensian is out of the question, right? Kaydick ? ). That next project would be Dark City, a brooding but inspired science fiction and noir film mash-up that prods questions about the nature of memory and identity, and how the two correlate.Inside a hotel room in a Fritz Lang inspired cityscape, a man (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in a hotel room. He finds himself sitting in a bath tub with no recollection of his past life. A corpse of a butchered woman lies next to him, and the woman has bizarre spiral incisions on her skin. A well timed phone call by a doctor Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) informs him that he is in danger, and must flee the scene. As he does this, a group of leather-clad Pinhead rejects enter the hotel searching for him. These outré G-men seem hell-bent on finding him at any cost. And there is something undeniably eerie about their shaved heads and weird cadences, kind of like if Jean Luc Picard took Mescaline. Thus a game of cat and mouse begins where our hero, a man we would later learn is called Murdoch, begins running fleeing through the city trying to give his pursuers the slip. Along the way, he begins noticing certain irregularities about it – first, there is a worrying lack of sunshine anywhere in the city. People don't sleep, but instead get frozen in time and have their heads drilled in by the Pinhead guys. And he himself begins exhibiting telekinetic powers. The leather gang known as the Strangers, influence all things in the City by way of manipulating the citizen's memories by implanting new ones into their minds every night. This serves as a terrifying massive-scale experiment with the intention of finding what exactly the human soul is. Besides Murdoch, another group of people is trying to decipher certain irregularities about the world they inhabit as well. Police inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) is also interested in apprehending Murdoch, as he believes he committed a string of murders around town. He starts noticing his own inability to remember his past, and slowly gets dragged into a much larger story as well. Murdoch's ex- wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) is searching for Murdoch as well, as she becomes embroidered in the mystery alongside Bumstead. With all of the pieces in play, the movie is free to create a dramatic tapestry woven from the perspectives of the principal characters. Their own stories add layers to the central narrative, and the mystery of the City. And while individually, these vignettes might seem disconnected, even random, they actually add up in the end, and actually make this chaotic screenplay feel approachable. From the very first scene, the movie establishes that it has a lot to say, and a certain dramatic messiness is present. It never truly goes away, as characters get introduced incredibly rapidly, only to get shafted a scene or two later.. In essence, the movie is a think- piece about how the concept of self gets thrown around and molded by various agents. When stripped to its bare essentials, what is the sole indivisible trait a person can have? That, and how to make mind-powered kung-fu not look hokey. The answers to these questions might not always be the most satisfying, but they are asked with style and an unbroken focus. But if Dark City excels at one thing, it is its visual identity. Recalling German Expressionism and pulp noir, every detail invests you in this mondo-bizarre world. Thick shadows envelop rooms, moody lighting and a black-amber-green color scheme instill a sixties-retro meets the end of the world vibe. Sharply dressed men and women litter the scenes, their faces creasing with existential dread. The actors moving through the sets make them look like parts of an overly edgy Edward Hopper painting. Out of the actors, leading man Rufus Sewell is played as an observer, a man of questions before action. Given the themes the movie deals with, he is an apt protagonist for this story. His blank slate-like state allows him to re-do the wrongs from his previous lives. The emotional crux of the movie consists of him reuniting with his estranged wife. This often too think-y movie can feel dispassionate, so a little emotional investment goes a long way. Add in a refreshingly optimistic ending, and this Dark City might not be as bleak as one would thing. William Hurt is an amazing actor, and besides delivering a few razor-sharp sidelong glances, he doesn't get a lot to work with in this movie. A lot of time is spent with his character, but it ends up feeling like exposition, rather than character progression. Jennifer Connelly is jaw- droppingly gorgeous, a femme fatale whose ice-cold heart slowly begins to thaw as the prospect of redeeming herself becomes possible. Not one of her strongest roles, but still a standout in a film chock-full of nervous weirdos.Director Alex Proyas always seems on the verge of greatness. Yet, there is always some niggling detail that prevents his work from attaining classic status. But among his movies Dark City stands as his finest work to date, and is one of the more satisfying products of this era of film-making.",Dark City

Classical film noir atmosphere with modern tones and ideas, a movie so dark and still emits light in the end. The camera is gorgeous, the actors are not bad, the plot is quite OK...I repeat for me the visuals are the best in this movie, you have to watch it, i do not want to tell you anything more it is a striking experience, preferably if you watch in a dark room all by your self with a cup in hand.",Dark City
340,Dave #42,This film ennobles science fiction,10,6 February 1999,"Roger Ebert said about a movie, I can't remember which one but I think it was by Woody Allen, ""This film ennobles comedy.""  'Dark City' ennobles science fiction. It masters what some sci-fi films grasp (2001: A Space Odyssey, Brazil, 12 Monkeys) and some don't (Any Star Trek after #4, Godzilla, Independence Day): Science fiction isn't all about nifty FX and scary-looking aliens- although ""Dark City"" has both- it is about new images, strange sights, a rebuke of normality, or a way to retreat from the dullness of everyday life. ""Dark City"" fulfills that. Although there are some moments that really suck-- an alien delivers the awful pun ""I have John Murdoch... in mind"" and Keifer Sutherland's Strangelove-ian mad scientist isn't exactly brimming with witticisms either-- dialogue isn't really important here. If you want dialogue, go see something by Quentin Tarantino or David Mamet. There's more than one way to make a great film. The brilliant director, Alex Proyas, brought us ""The Crow"" in '95, and that was a good film. This is a great one. His next one will probably be a mind-blower.",Dark City

I have not read any of the other reviews yet, nor do I care what they say (as I have a feeling a lot of them must be negative).  Something about ""Dark City GRABBED me in the very first scene and wouldn't let go until the very last one.  I was indignant that it won no awards the year it came out, and the entire time I was watching ""The Matrix"" (which I HATED, but that's another review entirely) I was driving everyone around me crazy with my constant indignant outbursts of ""Oh, this is SUCH a rip-off of ""Dark City!""In all seriousness, this is an amazing piece of work.  The mood, the mysteriousness, Sewell's intense yet lost character, Hurt's deadpan ""detective...for now,"" Richard O'Brien actually being creepier than usual as a drone revelling in the borrowed mind of a psychopath...my only complaint is that Connelly's nightclub singer was perhaps a bit TOO jaded, to the point of looking half asleep most of the time, but as I've been fond of the lovely lady since ""Labyrinth"" I'll gladly forgive her.  :)  I even enjoyed Sutherland's disjointed ""psychiatrist with (literally) nothing left but science and a spark of hope"" -- he annoyed everyone else I know who watched this movie, but I UNDERSTOOD him, I really did, so I thought his performance was wonderful.(What I also thought was interesting was how the entire movie was shot inthe same murky yellow-and-black ambiance as director Proya's other great work ""The Crow.""  If you didn't notice, watch it again and see...)In parting: the scene where Sewell's character Murdoch displays his newfound power by simply calmly *stepping* out of a trap as if it longer existed was ten times more powerful than ANY gaudy explosion in The Matrix.

I completely missed this one in the theatres and I don't remember hearing anything about it except in relation to The Crow (which I have not seen).  I am not a fan or reader of comics, but I can feel the influence in this movie.  And it certainly is a wonderful positive influence.  There is something immediately captivating about the well framed bits of information that unfold as the movie starts.  I am not sure where it happens, but it transitions into a movie with amazing depths both visual and with great characters.  I found this movie truly compelling because it really blended horror, noir, sci-fi and mystery with a grace and style that made them one instead of separate. I could do this movie a disservice by calling it the ultimate Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, a description that fits, but does no justice.  If you are a fan of noir, sci-fi or even interested from a special FX point of view you will do yourself a disservice if you watch it from that frame of mind.

343,aus_gof,Great plot...the rest was ordinary,6,23 June 2001,"Dark City has a fantastic, well thought-out plot, in a vaguely similar vein to that of The Matrix.However, there was very little insight at all in this film, except for the notion that human beings are defined by their souls, and although this formed the underlying thesis of this film, it never really felt like the film was geared to its analysis in a coherent fashion.
The pacing of the action was also too hectic, and as a result no scenes in the film really stand out in memory.It seems that the creative talent behind Dark City was not focused; the film is a jumbled mixture and does not hang together very well. Characters like The Inspector ultimately added nothing to the film, and one wonders at their inclusion.However, the film is worth seeing for the ingenuity of the plot, and Kiefer Sutherland's terrific performance. 6/10",Dark City

It's worse than Judge Dredd, and JD, as we all know, is not a masterpiece.What we've got here? Strange future city, which is totally unconvincing. Streets are empty, there is now ordinary people there. Who live here (beside this creepy, bald believers and some movie characters)? Do you know? Do Proyas know? I don't think so.

Remember too that this is coming from a dedicated Trekkie (yes I am fine with the term Trekkie and don't get why Trekkers get all bent out of shape) but Dark City goes to a level that no science fiction program or movie has ever gone to before in my mind. It maybe even approaches the level of the greatest science fiction writing in my opinion of all time which is Dune. The movie is incredibly dark and brooding with fantastic performances from all of the leads. It is incredibly mysterious and creates a mood unlike any other movie I have seen in my life and I loved literally not knowing what was going on or what was going to happen right up until the end.

Filmed primarily in Sydney and starring Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connoly, William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland, Dark City is an incredible piece of work with an intricate and detailed story with an even more amazingly executed motion picture behind it. The sets and visual effects have been so well thought out and performed that together with the impressive acting (including many Australian actors such as Colin Friels and that tall funny looking guy from Mad Max) the film simply sucks you in and you can fully believe that the word Proyas has created exists; which is something that not many film makers can achieve easily.

The music also complements the narrative style of the film. One of the title in the soundtrack titled ""Sleep Now"" perfectly captures the mystery elements of Dark City.

In the midst of this rugged future landscape, the character of Dekkard was the shadow of detective films of days gone by.Sixteen years later, director Alex Proyas gives us a piece of similar stature. In a land of surreal landscapes, puzzles, and the lack of four letter words, one can't help but show some curiosity.  Curious is the best word to describe the film.It is like Blade Runner in its use of symbolism, surrealism, and film noir. One needs to pay close attention to the details of the film or they will miss the genius.  The greatest similarity is a correllating theme: questioning one's own humanity and existence.  Dark City digs into the deepest facets of the mind, where one starts to ask questions of his or her identity.  The ultimate ""what if"" question is proposed.  What if everything you knew isn't real?  This question is asked in both Blade Runner and Dark City.  Both Films are intriguing as viewers start to question that themselves.  With Dark City, Proyas utilized that ultimate question to create both a unique, dark fantasy world and a creatively constructed story that is almost without flaw.Based on reviews I have read and comments I have heard from peers, people either really loved it or didn't get it.  It's a film to be taken in and thought about.  People expecting Proyas to give another Crow maybe disappointed.  This film goes far beyond the physical presentation and even goes far beyond the obvious symbols of such films like the Crow.  Dark City goes beyond film making to fine craftsmanship, taking everything that has ever been known and turning it into something that has never been seen before.  This is a film that is looked on with skepticism among many right now.  Years from now, people will recognize the achievement this film truly is.",Dark City

It seems one-dimensional, you wait for some spark of excitement, you wait for a twist in the plot, it never comes. Instead you a get predictable film containing one man's diary of a mad, weird, confused world.Great ending.If you like SF you won't be too disappointed in Dark City.

WOW, Dark city gives me creeps in one of the most hilarious ways. It's strange though, movie itself is nothing unusual, nothing special, it has a touch of low grade production.

However, my initial reservations proved to be totally wrong, and I implore anyone with similar feelings to go and see it to be as gob-smacked as I was.The movie provides several jaw-dropping set-pieces and is a hell of a lot better paced than most hollywood movies. Right from the perfectly understated opening scene to the final, climatic battle, your attention is never allowed to lapse. I will not reveal any plot details to spoil those who have not yet been enlightened, but I will say that the building change scene is the most original set-piece of the 90's. How crap like Armageddon grosses $200million and this little gem only grosses $14million is beyond me, but I hope it gets the following it deserves now it is out on video.When I say this is the best film of the 90's I do not come to that decision likely, but I beg of anyone who loves sci-fi to watch this. You will either love it or hate it.

I quickly  turned off the color and watched the film in black and white, which is how it should play.  It is a stunning science fiction fantasy/thriller with elements of a 1940's film noir detective story.

360,rjrozen,"Aliens vs. Humans, and logic is the loser",5,1 October 2006,"Going into a science fiction film, viewers should expect to suspend a good deal of their disbelief. For instance, if something in the movie defies the laws of physics, we can just assume that, in this particular universe, those laws don't apply. Nevertheless a science fiction film must make sense given its own reality. And that's where ""Dark City"" falters.The premise is that a bunch of aliens (""the Strangers"") are studying a group of humans so they can ... well, so they can do something, I'm not sure what. The Strangers can ""tune,"" i.e. alter reality at will (I'm not giving anything away here -- that point is mentioned in the opening titles). As it happens, one of the humans in their experiment, John Murdoch, can also ""tune."" The movie, then, is the story of the Strangers' attempts to capture or kill Murdoch (they're never quite sure what they want to do with him) while trying to complete their experiment so they can ... oh, I don't know, rule the world or something.Murdoch runs around, attempting to avoid both the Strangers and William Hurt, the accordion-playing detective who thinks Murdoch is a murderer, while simultaneously trying to figure out who he is because he can't remember anything. Fortunately for him, the Strangers sent to capture/kill Murdoch keep trying to stab him or hit him with blunt objects or do something else very conventional, forgetting the simple fact that THEY CAN ALTER REALITY AT WILL! (jeez, didn't they read the opening titles?). Had the Strangers remembered this salient fact, they could have captured Murdoch within the first five minutes of the film (Murdoch only gradually realizes the extent of his ""tuning"" powers, so he would have been easy to capture/kill/whatever early on).On its own terms, therefore, ""Dark City"" doesn't make any sense. After all, the Strangers can make skyscrapers pop out of the ground like dandelions, so why can't they manage to catch a single human? (they also have to rely on some kind of hypodermic injection to alter people's memories -- why don't they just ""tune"" those as well?) That's just the most annoying unanswered question in the film. Others involve the casting of Kiefer Sutherland (what were the producers thinking?) and the origins of Murdoch (who is this human who can ""tune"" -- how did that happen?).Apart from Sutherland, the performances are good, although Jennifer Connelly is woefully underused. The set design is quite good, and the special effects are effective, if not overwhelming. The writing, however, is, at times, laughably bad, even by sci fi film standards. The best line in the film goes to William Hurt, who, referring to his beloved accordion, says: ""It was a gift from my mother. She died recently. I keep it with me to remind me of her."" Good thing she didn't give you a piano, eh Bill?Oh, and one more unanswered question: where did all these people come from that inhabit the dark city? Actually, the answer to that one is hinted at in the film: they're all dead. Ooooh, spooky!",Dark City

You get the impression that the producers found it easier to make 100 extras look like Richard O'Brian than it was to make Richard O'Brian look human!
Kiefer Sutherland's doctor is a pantomime Igor, complete with lilting gait, scarred eye and breathy voice.Definitely worth a watch for the storyline, though, and Rufus Sewell and Jennifer Connolly pull off convincing performances.Oh, and block your ears for Kiefer's opening voice-over - it spoils the later reveals.",Dark City
365,ScarTrek,"Stylish, thought-provoking, but still good fun.",10,13 April 2003,"**Warning, contains spoilers**Wow. I just saw the movie twice in two days, which is saying something. But where to begin?Obviously, the Matrix comparison. Yes, this movie was made first, so calling it a Matrix rip-off is a sign that you should work on pumping up your IQ a few notches. Back to the point, they're similar, but yet so different. What am I talking about? Well, I'd say it's the style.There's no denying that both movies are stylish. The Matrix actually changed fashion when it was released. Dark City has a wonderful amalgamation of Film Noir and sci-fi, a weird juxtaposition that leads to a visual treat for the viewer. And it sets the movies miles apart. The plots have familiar elements. An artificial reality, subjective to those who are aware of it, an inhuman controlling race, a saviour character who learns to manipulate the reality better than the controllers. Yet they go about them in completely different ways.The Matrix is an action movie, first and foremost. Dark City is a mishmash of styles, with the old Noir detective mystery being one of the frontrunning feels of the movie. Do yourself a favour if you haven't seen it yet; skip the first two minutes of the movie. It explains a large part of the plot which is uncovered later on anyway, and it's much more satisfying if it's not just handed to you.The movie has pace, which again is at odds with its mood, yet somehow they work together brilliantly. A dark, dreary night with a fast-moving orchestral piece playing behind it as a character searches for answers, it's not what you'd expect, but it works. It's only heightened by the setting, the Dark City itself, which is a blending of many different architectural styles, though predominantly I was thinking of prohibition-era Chicago. Maybe it was the hats. Whatever, the end result is that it's an attractive movie, and beyond the surface similarities it doesn't feel at all like the Matrix.Also, I'd like to respond to ""mbredeck's"" comments. The movie is subtle, and I'd suggest repeated viewing, because you can miss an awful lot, like this person did. He asked a series of questions in his comment, claiming they didn't have answers, yet they did, right there in the movie.""Why do the bad guys try so hard to kill the protagonist?"" When they realise what he's capable of, they don't, they try to capture him. Like they manage during the end. ""How can they have so little knowledge of his whereabouts and activities during the story if they are supposed to be observing him?"" They observe by pausing the city at midnight, and taking the memories. They don't have surveillance cameras set up everywhere. ""The cop has a gun, why don't they have guns?"" Well how many times have they had to deal with anyone they'd regard as dangerous? None. ""Why don't they all get sucked out into space when they (improbably) break a hole in the wall and see outer space?"" There's a blue barrier a distance from the spaceship which marks the ""outside"" of the ship, presumably what holds in the oxygen. You see the detective and stranger pass through it as they fall, and see it again at the end when the ocean fills up. ""Why do we only see them shutting everything down at midnight--wouldn't there still be daylight hours that follow the tunings?"" Like the good Doctor says, they control even the Sun. As John does at the end. ""If they can tune the whole environment, why do they not use this ability to overcome the hero when they are trying to detain him?"" It looks like they need to put their abilities together to do this, and as they're in the machine, not able to see where John is, it'd be impossible. ""If the Strangers are a group mind, they would not need to converse with each other the way they do."" They have a collective memory, not mind. They act on their own, they just can't remember their own past. ""If they designed the machine that changes the environment based on their telepathic powers, why can't they control it as well as the hero, or at least prevent him from using it?"" They didn't anticipate the need to stop a human using it, they didn't even believe he could Tune when they found out. As for the level of control, it's one thing that's not explained. Speculating, these things are the size of squids. The human brain is about as large as their entire body. There's a hell of a lot more potential there.See, the movie is subtle, there's a lot to pick up if you pay attention.But despite everything I've said about the movie, there's one main point to it. It's fun. If nothing else, you have a bunch of aliens chasing around a guy with psychic powers. And that's just good fun to watch.",Dark City
366,Darnoc,The Best Scifi of the Ninetees,9,29 July 2004,"This is probably the best Sci-Fi-Film of the Ninetees. Matrix is good, but this film is better. Both deal with the same question: What is reality? Not only was Dark City first, it also handles the subject much better and more adult than Matrix. Also its conclusion is far better than the one of Matrix.Not only does this film deal with reality, it also deals with humanity, something which lacks Matrix. What makes us humans? To quote Dr. Schreber from the film ""Are we more than just the sum of our Experiences?"" This film is slowpaced, but not boring at all. And it deserves the title: Dark. The film is dark, ""noir"" and this gives the film a great atmosphere. The darkness and coldness of the strangers is in contrast to the bright light of the sun created by John Murdoch in the end.This film is very philosophic, which I like. The best films are those which help us to think and this one clearly is such a film. Something which is needed in our society of marionettes and idiotic consumers who know more than anyone else before in history but who lack the ability to truly think.The show down was a little weak, but the film made this up again at the very end with the last meeting between Murdoch and Mr. Hand. I remember Murdoch's words well and he speaks of a truth which is sometimes forgotten: What makes us human is not to be found in our heads, our brains and our minds.",Dark City
367,jncarr,Nice idea,5,24 August 2003,"What you have to remember with this film is that it is a few years before The Matrix, which you have to acknowledge, but that is where any sort of comparison ends.  The sets are great and at the beginning of the film the direction and the mood seems to be promising.  Unfortunately, you soon learn the film is badly mis-cast. Rufus Sewell, is unlikeable, Jennifer Connelly does not seen to have a clue what is going on and Kiefer Sutherland is the worst offender, with a daft voice playing the role that should surely have gone to an older actor.  Infact, I think Kiefer whould have done a much better job in the lead role,  I think he could have done the paranoid thing justice.  The plot is baiscally about a group of aliens called ""the Strangers"" who have come to our planet to experiment on humans to see what makes us tick, changing daily situations overnight.  One highlight is Richard O'Brien who is excellent as Mr Hand.  The movie rambles on with Rufus trying to figure out what is going on, but by the end you just don't care.

372,pacmatt,"Like the Matrix, but different. Also like Total Recall, but also different.",10,19 August 2000,"I don't see what all the deal is about between this and The Matrix is. Certainly, there are superficial differences (a controlled world, manipulated by godlike nonhuman entities, inhabited by people ignorant of their true situation. And one person with special powers discovers the truth and can free the population). Maybe that's a little more than superficial. Even so, I have never seriously considered this to be similar to The Matrix. Their styles are far too different for that. Anyway...On a deeper level, I'd say that Dark City is closer to Total Recall than The Matrix (possible Dark City and Total Recall spoilers ahead). Both deal with memories (specifically, implanted memories,) and how memories affect and shape our identities. However, there is a fundamental difference in the philosophies of the movies. In Total Recall, when Hauser is implanted with a new memory, he becomes Quaid, a different person with a different personality due to the different experiences that he has been through. In Dark City, Murdoch is Murdoch, even when his memories have been changed, or erased. His soul is the same, no matter how many times his mind has been messed with. I suppose I could take this a step further and say that the difference is that Total Recall regards a person as a product of the mind, while Dark City regards a person as a product of the soul, but I would say that at the risk of reading too far into the movie. I'll leave that to you.As far as style and execution are concerned, I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said, so I won't say anything. I will say that I enjoyed Dark City very much, and it deserves a spot as one of the finest fantasy movies ever made (it's not sci-fi: sci-fi has a foundation in science; Dark City's only science is Dr. Schreber's constructions, which is not really science (mixing memories in a petri dish?), and all the powers of The Strangers and Murdoch are mystical and unexplained).See it.

Not even humorous in any way, dark or otherwise. No plot or leads to follow. A soulless movie full of nobodies and boring characters, that never evolve to anything more than just a flashy image of neo-noir composition.

I thought that the intentional mixture of culture throughout the different eras really contributed to the mystic (and confusion) of the movie. However, the plot I cannot really comment on.  I can see where some members of the audience would feel frustrated in watching such a movie.  Nothing really made much sense the first time around.  It was, well, strange to say the least.  But watching the movie gave me a feeling of despair, fear and oppression.  The dark, wet and dirty streets of the city really created an atmosphere of loathing and suffocation.  I thought Jennifer Connelly was brilliant and gorgeous.  Overall, it was an enjoyable movie.",Dark City
382,YanTim,One of the Best Sci Fi movies ever.,10,29 April 2001,"Dark City is a visual masterpiece is film noir, science fiction, and yes ""existential.""  It is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I thought Rufus Sewell was excellent, as I discovered him in this movie.  I won't waste your time with plot details.  Some people will say the movie is too simple and the resolution too phony.  If you look hard, though, you will see a gleam of undiluted optimism in the darkness and nostalgia of this film. The characters are oppressed by the darkness, but something keeps them from folding.  Something drives them to overcome.  This is one of a few movies that can melt cynicism away.  In my opinion, anyway.",Dark City
383,Brian-268,Worst movie of the year,1,30 June 2001,"Everything about this movie was a disaster.  The acting was like something out of public access cable.  The story is blindingly stupid.  Rufus Sewell is hopelessly inert, Kiefer Sutherland an embarrassment, and Jennifer Connelly proof that some careers should be ended by act of law if need be. The only one who emerges with his skin intact is William Hurt.  The aliens are rip-offs of the Cenobites from Hellraiser.  The movie is just adrown in adolescent philosophizing and cinematic murk.  If you enjoyed this movie, odds are ten to one you are a precious, pretentious art student.  This is really the worst movie I've seen in about ten years, and one of the few where I felt I had actually been robbed--even though I got it as a free rental.",Dark City

The plot was strong and the suspense was edge of the seat, especially when the hero is on the run. The most stunning thing about Dark City is toward the end when all the thing that have been happening to the citizens of the city become clear. An eye opening.. woah was heard from the cinema patrons as the view panned back to reveal the whole city. I walked around Sydney after this film and looked up at the buildings and wondered ????",Dark City
385,drss1942,A great movie with a sensuous alluring Jennifer Connelly as a wonderful highlight.,9,9 December 2006,"John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) wakes up in his bath tub confused & dazed. He doesn't know where or who he is or why there is a dead hooker lying by the bed. He is quickly contacted by mysterious Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) & then stalked by The Strangers a nasty bunch of alien scum hellbent on making his life even more miserable. He soon discovers he's married to Jennifer Connelly who is at her most sensuous & alluring in this film. He quickly realizes that he's wanted by the police in the form of Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) who steadfastly tries to arrest Murdoch without allowing him to present his side of the story. Murdoch is helped along the way by Emma (Jennifer Connelly), the good doctor & May (Melissa George), an unbelievably nice prostitute. While astutely avoiding Bumstead he tries to find out why it's always night & if indeed he is the serial killer he is charged with being. Rufus gives a truly great performance. William Hurt's morose detective character alone is worth the price of admission. This is the film that taught me to respect Kiefer Sutherland. There are two items on the downside. That an advanced civilization would need to use invasive technology is just too dumb for me to be able to suspend disbelief. Why the aliens fall at first & later can fly is not explained. Overall the movie works & works well. I rank it up there with the all time best of the genre. drss1942 December 9,2006",Dark City

But as it gets close to the end, the movie just gets better and better. (Or should I say more and more meaningful?) The disclosure of the real dark city makes you feel like weeping for the unfortunate residents, who live in eternal darkness without any awareness.

387,zuoyi-30439,a good movie,8,11 April 2020,"Today i want to talk about Dark City, i was shocked by the end scene that the man pushed the door, the sun came in, there is a blue sea and sky, at the end of the road is his lover, the man became the new god. Just because of this ending, I have been always remember this film.Today to review this film, I feel completely different.
There are two places impressed deeply. One is that the man and the inspector found the poster of shell beach. The man tore the poster and smashed the wall with the inspector. The outside is universe, the city is a lonely island that surrounded by high walls, which block the people from understanding the outside. People just tools operated by the aliens and have no memory of their own. The second part is the man was arrested into the police station, man told the woman that everything is false, they did not know each other before, all the memories are false, but then she told him, my feelings are true.
How to say these two scenes? why a person is person? What is a soul? woman was injected the memory of that she was the actor's wife,and then she really fell in love with man, before the injection she did not love him, and then after injected into other person's memory, forget the man, she was no longer herself before. In this movie, people can be shaped by their memory, so what is unique to be a person?
The man tried to find his own memories, a awakening police told him the truth of this city and then suicide because of no ability to change. But for the man, he has own enough power, and finally succeeded to kill the aliens, he became the new god, but even so, he didn't know whether the memories is his.The people only the memory of a long time ago, the yesterday is blank. Maybe there is no matter whose memory in him, because he is what he is now.
Well, I don't know what I said, I felt a little lonely and helpless. ordinary people thought they were very important, but actually just nobody.

Keifer Sunderland is brilliant as the scientist who is bullied into helping the strangers, even though his speech get's a little annoying it adds to the character.This was recommended to my by my dad who is also quite the fan of sci-fi thrillers, and at first I was a little worried it might not be to my taste, but later i found myself enjoying it.

Like The Matrix, it causes the main character to understand that his view of reallity has been distorted. The film creates a universe, much like Matrix does, and though this universe is elaborate, it is not of the same depth and detail of that of the Matrix, though I acknowlege that this would be a rare and difficult feat. In general, I highly recommend this film. It's *not* a mindless action flic. In some parts, the action is downright slow, and causes some problems for me as a viewer.

391,ssssh-915-947755,My thoughts.... (apologies to the fans of this film),1,7 December 2010,"Let me start out by saying that I love my sci-fi films. I'm a fanatic, I watch hundreds of films every year and I believe the medium of film to be the most advanced form of art in existence. Sci-fi is my favorite genre, and I especially like the darker films ie, Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, Videodrome, Brazil, Alphaville, The Fly, Terminator, etc.So (if you're still reading) you can assume that I was pleased when I was able to locate a copy of Dark City. I had heard a lot about it, as an underrated film and a dark sci-fi masterpiece (or so I had heard).I wasn't sick when I began watching it, but by the end I was really wondering why I put myself through the whole thing. I understood what everyone was on about, but I wasn't able to get into the film at all. It was a mess, the backdrops were just plain ugly, the aliens were highly unimaginative and made me want to throw up, the way that old-fashioned and futuristic objects were stirred together just was appalling and the script was terrible (""I have him......IN MIND"").Now, none of these things would matter if done properly. The script could have been improved, the sets made more kind of oddly beautiful in an ugly way (see Blade Runner), the combination of old and futuristic elements more fluid, and the aliens having more than sub-60's-Doctor-Who creativity and believability (ie, not just greenish humans with no hair)In summary, this was almost a good film, but it ended up as a steaming pile of Dark Sh|t.",Dark City

By the end of the film, you do not feel you know Murdock as a person. He runs around a lot, does some fighting but that's about it. Nothing that would evoke empathy.Also, there isn't a single moment of humor in the film, which is a problem because relentless darkness without some light runs the risk of boredom.Finally, the other weakness are the pasty-faced alien villains, they're one-dimensional and more annoying than malevolent.",Dark City

In the next room he finds a dead body and a blood stained knife. What follows is john trying to piece together what is happening to him and what he unravels is one of the greatest science fiction stories ever put to film. There is a group called the strangers who have an ability to physically change surroundings of them and the people living in the city, they call this ability ""tuning"". They soon discover that john also has this ability, which is impossible as it would take a normal human a few lifetimes to gain the ability to ""tune"". Thats the most i can tell without giving away major plot points.The movie is set in a 1940ish looking city where detectives are hunting John, along with the mysterious strangers. The tall buildings and the knowledge that the strangers could be anywhere in the city gives a menacing ambiance, heightening the tension in the movie and giving off a great effect on the viewer. The special effects in Dark City are stunning and realistic, especially when certain characters use ""tuning"".Rufus Sewell gives a good performance as John Murdoch, though i could'nt help feeling he was holding back somewhat. I could think of a few other actors who could have gave a much better performance but he was generally good.Kiefer Sunderland as Dr. Daniel Schreber was very good and seemed to have put all of his effort into his character, its quite an unusual role for Sunderland but he pulls it off pretty well.Another performance worth mentioning is Richard O'Brien as Mr Hand, he gives a genuinely creepy performance as one of the main strangers, i thought i would see him and think crystal maze through all of his scenes but he does a pretty good job of playing a convincing character.Overall the movie leaves a few unanswered questions, leaving the viewer to conduct their own theories about the outcome of events. I have a good grasp of the story as a whole but some people will find bits and pieces confusing. A great film anyways, i gave it an 8 because it tends to drag in some spots, but the end makes up for all doubts.",Dark City

Was it OK ? It was great, it was just the perfect film... I saw it a few months later at the big screen on the Brussels Festival of Fantasy Film where the audience went wild !!! This film has it all: the perfect cast: ALL of the actors are so true in what they are doing, you feel the sadness, the confusion, you experience every bit of emotion they are living... the Gothic darkness of the city yet old-fashioned, the visitors are so creepy, they leave their traces in your own brain after watching the movie... The story makes you think about 1.000 questions of the human being, you must think of the Matrix (this is so much better guys !!!!), Blade Runner, Metropolis, Truman Show, 1984, THX, and so many other stories that set us reflecting our past and our future..

I'd love to watch this on the big screen if it ever comes to the theater again. It's doubtful that will ever happen.I'm not much of a sci-fi fan but this film stood out & captivated me. To me many modern sci-fi movies have overly convoluted plot & outrageous special effect. However, this one contained a good story & was better than ""Matrix"" in my opinion - it did not rely on hype or big movie stars. I was in awe of the dark & mysterious images in the film. ""Dark City"" did not get the attention it deserved & was definitely underrated. British actor Rupert Sewell did a fine job as the main character. Rising star Jennifer Connelly had a supporting role as his wife. Alex Proyas was ingenious in both writing & directing.Watch ""Dark City"" if you ever get a chance. You'll be amazed!",Dark City

400,nindude,Great movie but NOT original! **You must read this!**,10,13 April 1999,"I'm not going to repeat all the glowing reviews of this movie, although I must say I caught Dark City in the theatre where it was meant to be seen and I begged everyone to go see it but no one listened. Anyway...At the very end of the director's commentary on the Laserdisc 'special edition' of Dark City, Alex Proyas vehemently denies the rumor that he copied some other movie in making this one. I don't remember which one he named but I remember agreeing with him that he didn't copy that particular movie. In fact I thought that the comparision was ludicrous especially considering my knowledge. However, when he denied any inspiration and claimed that the film was his own work I just about choked. See my review of ""Cube"" for perhaps another example of this.Dark City was inspired by an obscure 1980's B&W independent comic book called ""Mister X."" Before I get a jillion emails arguing with me on this you might actually want to check out the book and finish reading these comments. BTW-I have every issue.No, the comic book and the movie aren't identical however the similarities are too obvious to be ignored. First one must remember that Alex Proyas has previous experience with this genre. (If you can call it that) His first film, The Crow, was also based on an obscure 1980's B&W independent comic book.Mister X is about a guy who lives in a city that is called Somnopolis. (Somno from the latin prefix meaning 'sleep') It is know as ""the City of Dreams, the City of Nightmares"" namely because its citizens have a penchant for falling asleep and going insane. Why? Because the city is constantly changing, shifting, and the architecture is designed all wrong. Any of this sound familiar????Speaking of the architecture, Somnopolis and the Dark City are basically identical towering-monolithic-dark-film-noir-gotham style buildings. Additionally the citizens, vehicles, and landmarks are styled in the same retro-futuristic-deco designs. Huge clocks loom all over Somnopolis much like the clock in the underground lair of the strangers. Any of this sound familiar?As far as the plot goes they diverge a bit but ultimately are the same. They both seek the same thing which is 'to save the city and their own souls.' There is no telekinesis in Mister X but rather lots of psychosis as drug use in prevalent as Mister X strives not to fall asleep so that he can complete is goal of fixing the city. His motto is, ""So much work, so little time."" I think one of the Strangers in Dark City actually uses this line or something very similar. Mister X is pale, bald and wears a long black trench coat, too. Sound Familiar??Anyway there are a lot more similarities but I think you can see pretty clearly that this work is NOT his own and this movie is NOT original. Don't get me wrong I love this movie - but I also loved it the first time I read it in the pages for Mister X. People should be credited for their work and others should not be able to capitalize on it. I normally wouldn't say anything but for the brash statements made by Mr Proyas on the end of the disc...",Dark City

It is little surprise that the Matrix, although its storyline stems from other places, has a lot in common with this movie.  I don't want to go into much detail, but I would recommend this movie for the pensive, science fiction group.  Although the final sequence has quite a bit of action and special effects, don't expect the whole movie to be that way. Most of the movie is psychological and must be analyzed.  Nonetheless, the Dark City still manages to come away with a plotline that's relatively easy to understand and a movie that can be more for those looking for it.My only dislike was the fact that, at times, the movie was EXTREMELY predictable.  There were several scenes where you could definitely tell what was going to happen, despite not knowing exactly how.  Also, the ending (which I don't want to spoil) doesn't fit well with the nature of the movie. I won't say more than that for fear of disapointing some of you.",Dark City

The ending ""mind"" battle between the hero and a blank archbadguy is particularly laughable, given the presumed seriousness. However, some ideas like altered reality and symbolisms are interesting though derivative. The acting and cinematography are of fairly high quality, except for the weak doctor role.

What makes it even rarer is that it's all in the plot, not the dialogue (which, strangely, elevates the dialogue). The movie deals with issues of identity, humanity, suffering, and memory. The central question is - what does it mean to be human? The secondary question is - what does it mean to be an individual?The first question is addressed by the Strangers, as they experiment with the humans. Are humans defined by their situations, their memory, their relationships? As they rearrange and change these elements, they study the question.The second question is addressed by John, who wakes up not knowing who he is. Are we more than the sum of our memories?

They not only please the eyes, but they make the mind think. This is not eye-candy junk. This is the real thing. A film which knows no boundries and does not add a nonsense storyline to it. It is sad to see people flock to The Matrix and over look this more original picture. You'll see sequels of The Matrix, but you will not see sequels of Dark City, because it is art.

The movie also contains what I feel is Keifer Sutherlands greatest part as the tortured Dr Shreber, along with the Richard O'Brian playing a great role as Mr Hand. A sequel would be nice, I've always wondered what became of the City after the credits have rolled.

416,petenickx74,I wish to never go back to Dark City,1,15 September 2005,"I'll start with the good.Set design is very, very well done in Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"". The lighting and costume design are all quite comprehensible and work, as well as the cinematography, all contributing to the overall atmosphere of this neo-noir cult film. In my personal taste, I would have liked to see the set even darker, even at the cost of hiding some of the wonderful backgrounds.Moving on:The music scoring comes and goes in terms of decency. Connelly's parts in the nightclub are lackluster, bad jazz in my opinion. The acting is Hollywood caliber, although I'm afraid Keifer's character was a bit annoying (speech/haircut). Be ready for Rufus and his distracting lazy eye(I don't doubt that they cast him with that in mind, which helps to portray the craziness of the character).Psionic powers = cheap gimmick/obvious plot device. Hoakey, personally didn't like that. Dr. Schreber only exists to advance to story through dialogue, I don't generally care for this type of storytelling.The Stangers should have only been revealed at the end of the movie! The sheer intimidation factor of a dagger that extends a half-inch is greatly terrifying, believe me, however redundant. A half-inch... what's the point? ;DThe Stranger who was a child (the only one apparently) doesn't quite make sense in my opinion, as it would only hinder his role by limiting him physically. This can be seen when he is forced to bite John's hand rather than pry his fingers loose or perhaps step on them. Maybe he should have used his mind powers to fling John from the building, oh wait, they only use powers when it's convenient for the story.Frankly I had trouble suspending my disbelief, I just couldn't get into it.

The plot line is refreshingly original and one equally as a magnificent as ""The Matrix"" If you enjoyed ""Batman"" or ""The Matrix"" series of films then you will simply love this movie.A species of aliens kidnap humans and place them in an experimental world far from earth to unlock the secrets of the human soul for their own survival. Each human specimen is implanted with life long memories and go about daily life blissfully unaware that they are part of a sinister experiment.Everday,at the stroke of midnight, each human strangely falls into a deep sleep and is then implanted with a new set of memories. A specimen might be a bank manager one day married with three kids with elaborate recollections of how he grew up, joined a bank and rose through the ranks to become manager, and the next day wake up to be a serial murderer who has memories of killing hundreds of people over several years.John Murdoch (Played by the remarkably restrained Rufus Sewell) is one human specimen who doesn't go to sleep at midnight and begins to discover the truth of the alien race playing god with people's minds.Its a wonderfully complex and intricate film with a very strong cast including the very underrated Ian Richardson as the head of the alien race, and the brilliantly menacing Richard O'Brien as his ""right hand man"" and William Hurt as a cop who also finds out the truth about the world in which he lives, and helps Murdoch's overthrow the strange alien beings.A chilling and provocative film which deserves more credit than it got! Go watch it now!",Dark City
418,wbradshaw-99518,Mind bending work of art!,8,8 July 2017,"Dark City is highly underrated as far as I'm concerned. This movie sets the bar for twisted alter dimensional movies, and really keeps you guessing throughout it's entirety. If there is one negative thing I can say about this movie, it would have to be the acting. I did find some of the characters to be a little lackluster in that department, Jennifer Connelly specifically. However, Keifer Sutherlands role as the doctor could certainly have been taken down a notch or two. There are moments when his acting is a bit annoying, and you feel as if he's trying to pass his characters personality off a little too hard. With that being said, this movie really hits the nail on the head when it comes to making humans feel as insignificant as possible, and I personally love that. It can be quite a humbling feeling to know that somewhere out there, we may actually just be the lab rats for a much larger experiment. That's just my opinion though. Back to the review, I feel that Director Alex Proyas does a great job with tying the story line together throughout the whole movie, and really keeping it all a mystery. I don't want to waste time here explaining the movie through a synopsis, but rather say this, if you would like a mystery movie that really keeps you guessing, this is for you. If you enjoy a movie that really unfolds towards the end and it gives you that satisfied feeling of understanding, this is for you. And last but not least, if you are into dark and twisted scenarios for the human existence, this is definitely for you! I thought it was fantastic!",Dark City
419,michax,Visual Masterpiece,10,23 August 2021,I watch it at list once a year. Great execution of interesting story. Scenography aged so well! Would love to see more movies in this universe with similar world building level of detail.,Dark City

Ever felt like your world is not what it seems to be?
Ever felt like there's an answer to that question you never dared to ask aloud?This movie will take these questions and make a masterpiece out them. It'll take your mind and sink it within the plot. Trust me, you will sit there, mindlessly following the story, waiting, impatiently desiring the answer to the question: ""what is going on?""
It will come, and it will hit so hard it'll make you question your very own reality.
It's like the Matrix, but very different. Can't say better, but it gives the same feeling.Totally worth it!",Dark City
421,Karl-14,An Outstanding Visual Experience,10,16 August 1998,"One of my friends, Julien, saw this movie before me. The next day he told me about it : He said that this movie was the worst movie he ever saw so he told me to not go see it in theater. So I have waited to rent it on videocassette. When I saw it, I was so surprised by this movie. It's a pure visual experience that reminds us of Blade Runner. And the plot is excellent, the acting is also excellent. So in conclusion, Dark City is one of the best movies I've ever seen ( and maybe the best ). A big 10 !",Dark City

I won't rehash the plot, since the reviewer above did a good job on that in his write-up.  Let me just say that you can't call yourself a serious sci-fi fan if you haven't seen this stylish mystery film noir.",Dark City
423,0840,A review of the movie Dark City,4,5 October 1998,"The film's cinematography was really good. I liked the look of the film and the feel of the film. The film's concept was very promising and all together good. It was too bad that the acting and the storyline to the movie didn't live up to the expectations it was given by most of the people that I knew that went and saw the movie. The plot was confusing as well as boring and made the semi-good parts of the story hard to catch. The film almost put me to sleep in some parts, but I tried to stay awake, hoping it would get better. All together the movie was a waste of time and money for me, and I would not recommend it.",Dark City
424,Flagg-2,Awe inspiring!,10,5 December 1998,"If the academy allowed science fiction into the Oscars (for categories other than visual effects and set design) Dark City would have a really good chance of winning motion picture of 1998.  There is so much about this film that is just plain right.  The first time I saw it I was (and mind you this rarely happens) on the edge of my seat by the end.  The film takes a bold step in letting the audience wonder about things for the first hour.  When questions are finaly answered they are both disturbing and satisfying. The film is exciting on both the visual and emotional levels.  Alex Proyas could be our next Lucas, Spielberg, or Cameron.",Dark City
425,Brian-110,Peter Lorre,7,17 February 1999,"Sutherland's portrayal of the psychiatrist is homage to Peter Lorre and is reminiscent with his characters in ""M"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"".  This is consistent with the strong and effective use of film noir in this film.",Dark City
426,NJCult,Execrable,1,25 May 1999,"I nearly fell asleep in the theater a quarter of the way through the movie. Dark City was not compelling, the plot was contrived and directed at the moody trenchcoat wearing audience who will gladly eat up anything that is served to them that they can be assured no one else will like.During a second viewing, on video, I remembered the pain I felt while sitting through this movie. I have yet to see what people see in this rubbish that is so gloriously beautiful.The ending was supremely terrible. Look! The lab rat has become powerful like the scientist and now he's going to take over the world (or the maze of rats). Once it became apparent that he was ""special"" the movie went from bewildering to predictable.Zero stars out of five stars along with 5 minutes in a closet with Proyas slapping him repeatedly.",Dark City
427,Hawkwind-2,Better than I expected... a pleasant surprise.,8,9 March 1999,"When I first saw the trailers for this movie and references to ""Illusions"", I was sure that it would be full of the same kind of continual confusion and in-your-face surrealism that are the signature of movies like BRAZIL and JACOB'S LADDER.To my pleasant surprise, the movie manages to include a fair portion of those surrealistic elements, and it still has some logical underpinnings that gradually emerge that, unlike the aforementioned movies, offer some solace for those of us who feel like there should be some order behind a movie.Other than this feat of making surrealism actually work in a movie, I also appreciate the casting of Jennifer Connelly in Dark City. There was something about her soft, sensual nature that made you want everything to work out for her character, and made for a nice contrast to the harsh, brooding nature of the sets and story.",Dark City
428,Hamson,A mess...,2,14 May 1999,"I looked forward to seeing this film, so I was badly disappointed when it turned out to be a pretentious, ridiculous mish-mash of ideas. Overlong and hard to follow, the climax comes straight from an issue of X-Men (where it would have been done better). The only reason I didn't give it a ""1"" is that the visuals were generally very good.",Dark City

I have heard a lot of hype for the movie, but thought that it would crumble under the pressure that the hype created.  When I finally saw the movie I was drawn to it right away, I connected with characters and felt like I was part of the city.I went back to my vote history and knowing that Dark city and Matrix are basised on the same book lowered the score I gave matrix.  This movie did it better. If you want to see a movie and can stomach the dark edge, this is for you.",Dark City
430,DukeRem,What if the aliens were sociologists?,7,18 June 2003,"The plot is somewhat similar to that of ""The Matrix"", in the sense that people living in the dark city can't know for sure what's real and what's not. The big difference is that here everything is done by manipulating people's minds, and not by running a complex simulation. Some aliens are trying to understand what makes a human being an individual; in order to do that, they steal someone's memories and implant them into another guy. Will the latter behave exactly as the former would have done, or differently? It's all a big social experiment, with humans as cavies; but something goes wrong, and one man, according to Darwin's theory (survival of the fittest) evolves and becomes able to change the world himself, exactly like Neo in Matrix. But this movie came first!",Dark City
431,schrimp,Possibly the greatest movie of all time,10,17 July 1999,This movie is absolutely fantastic.  I cared for the characters more than I ever have for any other movie.  And the special effects are fantastic (like those of the Matrix but on a much smaller scale).  There is also a plot twist that will surprise even the most astute movie goer. 10/10,Dark City
432,republikaner,Dark City is everything that Matrix should have been!!!,10,28 July 2000,"Dark City is a masterpiece of a film, very dark and obsessive. The plot is very much like that of the Matrix. The big difference is that where the Matrix, wound up being a semi-kung-fu action thing Dark City focuses more (at least in the first half) on, creating a scary atmosphere instead of all-out action.",Dark City
433,bakedbean,Better than the Matrix,9,11 January 2002,"This film has been largely overlooked by many and was overshadowed by the Matrix. Both have similar stories but I believe that Dark City, which was released before the Matrix, is the better film.The story is very good and has a twist which you don't expect. The actors are particularly impressive, the British actor Rufus Sewell is a good lead, while the supporting cast play their roles well. It is constantly dark and the score plays constantly throughout the film. While it has a similar story type to the Matrix it is not to the same pace of that film. This is more of a dark brooding film and while it has it's set pieces the story drives it not the other way round. It is difficult to talk about this film without giving too much away. So it is best just to say if you like mysteries get this film,if you like science fiction get this film and if you liked the Matrix get this film. In short get this film you will not be disappointed.In short :- Better than the Matrix.",Dark City
434,stormbringer126,One of the best sci-fi films ever,9,9 September 2000,"Not since Blade Runner have I been so impressed with the dark visuals of a movie.  This movie was given way too little credit, although Ebert praised it.  I ran out and bought it on video as soon as it came out, and when I got my DVD player, I bought it again.  One of my all time favorites.  I just wish everyone could have seen it in the theater to enjoy the sepia, moodily lit, 8mm quality of the film.",Dark City
435,moviebuff,One of the best sci-fi films you'll ever see!,10,5 February 2001,"I have always been disappointed that this film never received the recognition it deserved when it was first released (except of course by Roger Ebert). Having just seen it again I am still stunned by it's originality and intelligence. Finally a science fiction film that requires you to think (and pay close attention)! One that does not assume that the audience needs every aspect of the story to be explained to them at every moment or whose plot is so transparent there are no surprises. I dare anyone watching this film for the first time to try and guess the plot as it unfolds. And not just a sci-fi film but an amazing blend of sci-fi and film noir that hasn't been seen since Blade Runner although this film is far superior in every way. All the performances are excellent especially that of Keifer Sutherland in probably his best and most original role to date. And the look of this film has not been seen before. Yes there have been other ""dark"" cities in similar films (Blade Runner and Batman to mention two recent ones) and this one certainly uses elements from those as well as Metropolis but in doing so the result is something wonderfully original. Just spend some time and look at the backgrounds and set elements and try to place them. Futuristic structures, 1940's art-deco, modern accents. One would think that such diverse elements would look out of place but the set designers make it all work to give this film it's special feel. It was also great fun to see Richard O'Brien once again. With his wonderfully creepy and menacing turn as Mr. Hand it is surprising that we don't see him in more films. For those who have not seen this film, add it to your must-see list. You will not be disappointed.",Dark City
436,p-bover,"good concept, bad execution...",6,12 April 2008,"Although I really like the idea of the script and the whole atmosphere(art direction, music), the movie lacks IMO of depth in the execution.¿Super powerful aliens using knifes because that fits with their nosferatu look? This is ridicule... Well I have to say that except for some dialogues, the aliens are plain dumb. This is the reason why they use knifes, and they get fooled in their own world.¿An average of 1.8 seconds per shot to put more tension during the whole movie? There a lot of bad quality filler shots that take time from the really great shots and mess the rhythm of the movie.This movie could have been great if the work had been more focused on the symbology, the literature, and not the visual gimmick. The same applies for the whole matrix trilogy IMO.",Dark City
437,darkboy1200,A true modern-day classic...,10,30 July 2008,"I remember as a boy, having my father bring in the VHS copy of ""Dark CIty"" from Blockbuster and being nothing short of mesmerized by it's entire set-up. A complete decade later, I decide to pop in my DVD copy of ""Dark City"" and let me just say, the film still holds its ground to this very day. Roger Ebert did his own commentary on the movie, and I like how he describes movies like this as a genre in themselves because only were special effects truly starting to evolve at this point. The characters are able to interact with this strange world, and it makes for visually striking images. Lots of things can look corny, due to age, but it's almost a window into the 90s and, in my own opinion, it's spark of creativity seen in almost every faucet of life. Dark City portrays the idea of what-if. What if mankind were nothing more than guinea pigs? Our very existence completely controlled by highly-evolved beings who use us as experiments to find out how mankind is able to withstand the test of time, and remain plentiful in population. The beings are described as Strangers. Almost a homage to the one thing every parent tells their kids, ""Don't talk to strangers."" In the Strangers world, they are able to distort the reality using telepathic technology that allows to literally make their own world. This becomes their testing lab, and the humans are the lab rats. They make only one city, and in this city they implant entire memories with surroundings to match. This manipulation of reality is called ""tuning"" as chosen by the Strangers. From picture in your wallet, to the mansion over your head, they provide literally everything to the human race, in hopes of discovering some kind of pattern that would let them save the Strangers dwindling population. The Strangers change everything around, during a complete shutdown where all time freezes and humans simply sleep through the time. During this time everything is changed and they have a specific human help to do their work. Dr. Daniel P. Schreber implants memories into peoples foreheads, using syringes full of chemicals that act almost as a disk for a computer. He implants the memories, making a middle class slob into a hoity-toity millionaire. Every once in a while, people wake up during the shutdown, and see what happens. Strangers merely round these people up, either starting over again with them, or killing them. One of these strays though is different than the rest. A man by the name of John Murdoch has the same ability to ""tune"" just like the strangers. Perhaps it is human evolution, the ability to adapt, when the Strangers realize that Murdoch is able to do something no other beings but themselves should do, they realize the answer to their questions may have just been answered. One problem, John Murdoch woke up during a memory replacement procedure. Incomplete, Murdoch was only able to pick up fragments of his memories. He was intended to be a killer, but even with the memories, he knows that deep down, that is not what he is. So he sets off, to not only find who he is, but also tries to define what is reality, not just in his own life, but in the entire world around him. As a good movie lover, I'll try not to go too deep into the plot, and let you, the reader, watch what is quite possibly one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. The cinematography, the well acted parts, the striking images created from the settings and wardrobe. This movie still grabs me as much as it did ten years ago. It's no secret that the plot in of itself is not original, nor is it perfect, but I'll agree with Roger Ebert and say this one deserves to stand the test of time, and be called a true classic.",Dark City

This movie delivered that thinking process with the entertainment too! Though, I am entertained when I learn something more than just seeing the same old same old. I thought that this movie was like a weird dream that I might have. I was disappointed in how much the Matrix copied this movie. (I know, I know, a lot of people of commented on that on the comments forum.) I mean, the chosen one, the dark sky, and underground theme, a race of people controlling a surreal world. But, overall this was great! I think that the Noir was a cool touch, but I admitaddly usually hate film noir all together. Overall, this movie is great, a real 10/10!",Dark City

The end blows it.The rhythm of the story is too fast paced, there are too many things to say, too many paradoxes to reveal and philosophic topics to talk about.With 30 minutes more, this would be a perfect movie but for the end. What was that. Give the main guy superpowers so he can destroy everything. Too cheap. Well shown as all the movie, but i think there were tons of clever ways to end the movie not resorting to superpowers.In a movie where every line of dialog counts, that ending is a fatal wound that leaves the audience confused with the way everything unfolds. The ending of the characters is nice, perfect too, but not the way they get it.As much as i love Proyas, The Crow was a more solid movie.

Dark City had the potential to be one of those works, but failed rather miserably because it was too busy worrying about how it looked and forgot to flesh out its premises enough to ask daring questions. Instead it caved in to tired old cliches of evil overlords, the greatness of humanity, individuality and of the human soul, and a savior human who just so conveniently happened to be more powerful than all the forces of the aliens combined. Skip it if you're looking for something that will actually challenge your mind.Two stars out of five.",Dark City

The film is excellent and achieves all it set out to do, spinning a finely-crafted narrative while dripping dark noir themes. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it did feel a little long at times and the special effects with the final fight felt underwhelming. I really don't want to give anything away with this movie, it's better to go in knowing as little as possible (and there are thousands of detailed reviews already).

444,solgursky,The best science fiction film since Metropolis,10,4 March 2010,"You could say this movie was a precursor to The Matrix, but its better than that. You could say this movie takes its cues from Bladerunner, but it would be more accurate to say it got those cues from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. You could say this is the best sci-fi movie ever, and I would only put up a token argument. Throughout the film there is an incredible amount of tension. The special effects are amazing (especially for 1998), and somehow it never bites off more than it can chew. The plot is daring, complex and filled with twists, but in the end it completely makes sense. There were so many times when this movie could have fallen apart, devolved into nonsense, but it always holds together. The acting is great, the visuals are great, and the script is great.

If I have one good thing to say about this film, then it's that. But, sadly, I did not enjoy this movie, which I have to say I was really looking forward to after hearing so much positiveness in regards to it. I think I just found it... annoying. There was something about the dialogue and the acting (neither of which were particularly bad) that just didn't gel properly. Keither Sutherland's speech patterns made me want to just pick up the nearest living organism and strangle it, and then strangle it some more. I also found the plot to be a bit clichéd - it read more like a '70s Doctor Who serial than anything Philip K. Dick would touch with a stick. I just didn't think the answers in it were as exciting as the questions were, which can never be good.

At its core, we can postulate Dark City as an argument between free will and predestination, a love story, a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Moody and dark overall, somber as befits the material, Dark City walks us through the long dark night of the soul. A parable, perhaps, as are the best stories, we identify with John-Anyman as he seeks to slay the demons that would slay him. Yes, and the Strangers, what of the them?

One of the most outstandingly creative, intelligent, well-crafted philosophical filmic SF journeys in decades! Even though I found the very ending to be a bit week (though passable) and tangentially inconsistent with the visceral flow and power of the film as a whole, I heartily recommend ""Dark City"" to all those who thrive on a challenge to the imagination and have the courage to question the darkness in a quest for the light.",Dark City

And i cant believe that this is the same director of I, Robot which i found to be really only average. Dark City is simply a great movie, with an atmosphere and story that really drags you in from the beginning to the end. And i don't think it is only for sci-fi fans. I was also surprised that it was the Proyas own story...i mean of course he was inspired by many things for it, but i think he left a unique mark with it.Proyas could have been a damn good candidate for directing at least some of the storm of superhero movies thats been coming out lately, i hope it isn't because he has been ignored cause the man can really create some tension and keep a good story together....maybe it just doesn't interested him. well there's still hope 8 out of 10 for Dark CityAnd it is mainly because of Sutherland's character that i didn't give it 9.

457,The Gozz,Dark City: An instant classic,10,14 August 1998,"This is one of the best science fiction films that I have ever seen.  The breath-taking visual effects, original storyline, and outstanding performances are the main attractions of this epic masterpiece.  Following at a close (very close) distance are the magnificent set design, costumes, and excellent cinematography.  All of which serve to bring to the film a delicious, darkly brooding, gothic atmosphere.  It has certainly become one of my favorite movies, and will probably be remembered as one of the best films of the decade.",Dark City

I've only seen the type of visualization this movie has to offer in City of the Lost Children by France's Caro and Jaunet.Although I noticed that there's some parts of the movie parallel to ""City of..,"" like the manipulation of human memory, a group of people envying humanity, etc., I still think it has a good degree of ""originality,"" considering where it is made.If you want to see Batman and Robin (I mean the visual effect) minus the silly nodding of George Clooney, plus a good, well-thought plot, you go see this movie!",Dark City
460,swolf-3,"Original, spectacular, and moving.",10,28 September 1998,"With fine performances that chilled, moved, inspired me, this film was so much more than a monumental visual achievement.Alex Proyas has written, directed, and produced a film that is now in my all-time top ten list.  Of course, my list is populated with visionary original works by Terry Gilliam, and other odd but spectacularly original films like Twelve Monkies.  If you were awed by Twelve Monkies, this is a sure thing for you.I recently had the misfortune of viewing Sphere.  A pathetic, overwrought non-event bloated with big-star hysterics by the like of Dustin Hoffman. None of that here.  I guess it is the big studio distribution system that hides gems like this from an audience starved for originality and quality.See it.",Dark City
461,Aragorn-6,"Slow at first, ended up brilliant. Very enjoyable.",8,18 September 1998,"Dark. Dark indeed. How can I explain it? Well, at various times it reminded me of Total Recall, any Terry Gilliam movie (especially 12 Monkeys and Brazil), Japanese anime, City of the Lost Children, and a splash of The Truman Show. Not for everyone, I'm sure, but worth a look.A little slow at first, until you get the gist of what's going on. Keifer Sutherland's character was a bit annoying (rather two-dimensional) at times, but other characters are just as enthralling as his is distracting. I just love to see anything that includes Richard O'Brien (of Rocky Horror Picture Show fame) in the cast. I enjoyed most of all the atmosphere, and just the fact that this film is not typical Hollywood drivel for the masses. Good music as well. Basically, if you're into weird or off-kilter films, give this one a try.Thanks for your time.",Dark City
462,rufus-10,Great movie for Sci-Fi fans!,10,2 October 1998,"What I liked most about this movie is when you begin to watch it, you are as confused as John Murdock is about what's going on and his surroundings.  The way the story is written you can't help but get into it yourself.  I love the suspense and confusion but I also love how it pieces itself all together in the end. I also love that even though it has a happy ending, it really isn't that happy of one because John cannot send his race back to were they came from or give them their 'real' memories back.  The only thing he can do is make the best out of the situation.",Dark City

464,KAN-2,A sci-fi movie that makes you think,10,6 April 1999,"Alex Proyas has done something really special here. He has made an interesting movie with serious philosophical questions. What if everything you think is reality is only a dream, and the only place that reality exists is in your head? The plot concerns a city where its inhabitants are reinjected with new memories every midnight, hence what they think is their past is really just a story that has been implanted into their heads. In this city, one man wakes up and the movie follows him on his journey to the truth. What is really stunning about the direction is the way in which the audience is in the same position as the hero: they do not know what is going on in the beginning and slowly piece together the truth at John Murdoch's side. The most revelatory sequence, where John sees the shape of the city changing, is perfectly placed and suitably grand. A lot is explained in this sequence only through images. New buildings rise out from the ground as old ones melt into it, telling the audience, and John, the true nature of this city. All of this leads up to an ending fight sequence in the classic good vs. evil vein. The technical areas of this movie are stunning. The city itself is beautifully constructed out of dark, noirish images bathed in flickering lights. The special effects accomplish two goals which movies rarely accomplish anyome: they look gorgeous and, more importantly, serve to tell the story. It fully explores the consequences of living in the kind of world that is created here, unlike the newer release The Matrix, which borrows so much from Dark City, but fails fails to spark the imagination the way that dark city does. Here is a movie that will truly make you wonder about the nature of human beings: are we really just creatures manufactured by experience or is there really something inherent in each of us that makes us who we are. This movie, although probably aimed at the teen sector, will appeal to anyone with a sense of imagination and a romantic belief in the human soul.",Dark City

The design of, well, everything, from the costumes to the City itself, is absolutely marvelous, and the special effects looked really great. The story's smart too, and there's lots of suspense: you keep wondering what's going on exactly. Combine that all with top-notch acting and a sizzling finale, and you've got one of the best sci-fi movies I've ever seen.",Dark City
469,Greenman-3,Very well done,10,16 May 1999,A truly riveting movie. A great film that causes you to think about its implications rather than spoon-feeding you plot.

One year later, ""The Matrix"" comes along, with a suspiciously similar plot -- only with a bigger budget, and as an action movie. ""The Matrix"" had everything that ""Dark City"" lacked. Watch them both, and then see the inspiration behind this summer's greatest action movie.",Dark City

I was shocked by how much love is thrown at it in IMDb comments but then I figured out that most of the rave reviews are from folks who are younger. That's great. Even greater is that there is a TON of fine S.F. that you will be enjoying as you proceed with reading (I hope) and movie watching.FWIW, the mind-candy of ""Dark City"" is on a level of a good ""Twilight Zone"" episode. It's climax is a ""borrow"" from the 60's film ""The Power"". The imagery is little more than ""old school"" if you have watched more than a few Warner Bros. ""B movies"".Mainly I will remember this film fondly for giving Richard O'Brien a well deserved turn in what is, at heart, one more ""Late Night Science Fiction Picture Show"".",Dark City

In fact, if there were no such movie as The Matrix, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more thoroughly. This film of course predates Matrix, but nevertheless it barely touches on a great deal of the material that Matrix illustrates so beautifully. The premises of the movies are, at their core, the same - that reality is not at all what it seems. But while the Matrix picks its implications - for instance, while in this film the relationship among wife and family are paramount, in Matrixthey are completely ignored - here the plot bogs down around the wife, thesteely investigator, and the main character. At the same time it fails to explain enough about the strangers or their perplexing abilities, and leaves keifer sutherland to carry much of the life of the movie. Visually it's grand stuff, and I have always admired Proyas>",Dark City

The flick gives you an experience in a world unlike any you've ever experienced before.   The look of the picture was cool and the director has a unique style that's a pleasure to watch.

But when I actually saw it a few days ago I was surprised at how much excellent viewing this film does.It combines noir (reminds me of The Big Sleep), surrealistic (Lost Highway) and science fiction elements. The story is about a man who awakens in a hotel room, with his memory erased and being wanted by the police as a serial killer. He soon discovers that he has telekinetic powers as the subject of an experiment. But he finds out also that he lives in a world ""beyond all imagination, where the night never ends"".

476,Do Trinh,Ending is just incomprehensible to me.. (WARNING: SPOILER of the ending),7,2 June 2000,"This movie is the perfect example of the kind of movies that leave you unsatisfied. Why?? Because of the ending of course! And the most annoying thing is, that you only get this feeling with movies that are absolutely enjoyable up until that dreadful ending and THAT is just such a shame.The concept of a fake reality is as old as the visions of Plato, and maybe that's a clue to why we find it so fascinating. It's in the nature of humans to ponder about worlds beyond our senses and our desire to `uncover' those worlds. This is why we have some of it in sci-fi episodes from the Twilight Zone, Star Trek  etc. and movies like The Truman Show, The Matrix and..Dark City. It appeals to a basic human need to look beyond the visible.Alex Proyas uses this concept to create a captivating movie. The viewer quickly identifies with John Murdoch's search for the reason why strange looking men (guys looking like Pinhead from Hellraiser, but without the pins) are trying to capture/kill him. A beautiful girl (Connelly) and wacky doctor (Sutherland) are included..and William Hurt has to bring in the needed portion of scepticism (although he isn't sceptic for long. This is all very nice, and as I said very entertaining. But why can't people make some gratifying end to a good movie?? I mean, once you find out what `reality' is, you don't go out (slightly improve the fake reality) and continue with your life? NO!! You make sure you get back to where you came from!!! Or in the case of the Truman Show, out of the fake reality as fast as possible. Ok, this last option can't be easily' achieved in Dark City like in Matrix or Truman Show , but at least leave the viewer with the knowledge that Murdoch is attempting to get back from wherever he and everybody else came from! Wouldn't you do the same in his place???Even though the ending didn't have a MAJOR plot-hole like in The Andromeda Strain' (also a good movie except for the ending), I couldn't help but say: `WHAT!!!!!!!!!???????' when the credits started rolling over the screen: a very good sign the disbelief comes crashing in like thunder.Could have been an 8 out of 10, but now I can only give it a 7 (but with a recommendation to watch if they're showing it on T.V.)",Dark City

Everywhere he looks, even more confusing thoughts assault his vacant mind.  He doesn't know who he is, he doesn't know where he is, and... Didn't he see that person somewhere else, doing something else just yesterday.  Where is the sun?  Where is the weather? Where is the mythical Shell Beach that everyone recalls fondly yet cannot seem to find?  Are the building's really changing before his very eyes?  Is John the killer he suspects himself to be?  And most importantly, who are the strange, albino-skinned men who are chasing him?These are the sensations that run through your mind as well as John's as you watch ""Dark City"", one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  Without any idea as to what is going on, what is really going on, you will be pulled and yanked through one layer after another, hoping to find out what's going on, fearing what lies behind every corner.  Our hero soon realizes, no part of the city is safe, the very ground is controlled by the enemy, and not even his fellow man can do anything to help him.  Yet this is not a movie about hopelessness, this is a movie about inspiration, hope, and love.  This is a movie that asks if you forgot everything you knew tomorrow, would you still be the man you are or would you become something better, or worse?I've heard a lot of people say a lot of bad things about this movie.  They say the acting is bland, and the characters one-sided and empty.  They say the ""strangers"" look like ""Cenobites"" and the effects are straight out of Gilliam.  I ask you to think about it though:The characters are empty, with memories being switched constantly, losing a little more of what they are with every lost thought.  They wander in a dreamy haze, devoid of real emotion, being given love and hate in a shiny glass cylinder every couple of days.The Strangers do look a bit like Cenobites, but you wrap anybody in leather and they will look a bit like those horrific characters.  Yet you do not see the Cenobites don trenchcoats and hats to try and blend in while they stalk their prey, now do they?  Sooner or later two things are going to look just enough alike and we scream bloody murder.  You can only have a character don so many outfits before he looks like someone else.Gilliam has affected everyone.  His outlandish style and wonderous effects will aways be idolized by half of hollywood and imitated by the other half. Dark City happens to hit middle ground, being just enough plaguerism to be praising.OH, and on a final note, mute the first few minutes of the movie, right up until the camera enters John's bathroom.  Trust me, you'll enjoy it immensely.",Dark City

It predates The Matrix, yet surpasses it in many ways, in its philosophical exploration of reality, perception of reality, and the workings of the human mind and soul (without turning pretentious or boring). Wachowski Brothers played it safe when making The Matrix. Alex Proyas has far more guts than the brothers put together, and his movie remains unpredictable and wondrous throughout, solidly tied together by the visual style that seems to be the director's strongest side, and without having to resort to endless fight sequences in order to create suspense. Dark City doesn't need Kung Fu - it's got suspense oozing from its very fabric, and keeps you wondering what happens next.",Dark City

489,GoldAnthroWolf,"When in Rome, become the Romans.",10,10 January 2002,"I watched Dark City again for a refresher in the 'body and mind', of sorts. Once again this movie does not fail me for the type of pump my brain needs to get going.What else can you expect from a movie that is reminiscent of Batman, or some other dark and moody cityscape, and in the first five minutes you are introduced into a world so familiar to our own yet so alien.  Speaking of aliens, the buggers in this movie simply are out to find us out, but we as humans show them that we are more then the sum of our memories.
Illusions and self-grandeur and the ability to overcome adversity and evolve is more then likely a key element behind this story.  As someone else commented on it, it is vaugely resembling The Matrix, but in no way is it the same type of movie.  This movie makes you stop, think, and even re-examine some fundamental concepts that perhaps we all take for granted.One of the BEST elements of this movie is the whole 'when is it', as it never does say when it is.  For all we know (the viewer) the 'Dark City' could have been in space for a year, or ten-thousand years after the Strangers abducted the humans.  Whatever the timespan, it certainly leaves you with a sense of 'awe' especially when you see the city.Overall I'd recomend to anyone who wants a quick and cheap mind blast to rent/buy this movie and watch it a few times, especially when you're not quite awake.Two-Paws up for this movie, and I'd wish they'd perhaps make a sequeal to tell us if perhaps they figure out 'where they are' and manage to get back home.",Dark City

But anybody who thought they saw the same film about a year before hand werent seeing thing's,as dark city is a far more original and  groundbreaking film. It may be a less action packed film than the matrix,but it has a more grown up script and a darker,gothic tone(maybe that's why it floped at the box office)than the desperately cool,comic book tone of the matrix.

491,thancock-3,Begins well but degenerates rapidly,4,11 May 2015,"===Spoilers==Since this is a genre movie, I would give it a 7 rating for people who like science fiction.This movie was pretty high on a list of all-time favorite science fiction movies, so I checked it out.Like most modern movies, it looks great, and looking great gets people onto social media quickly to call it their favorite movie, until the next one. Every quick shot, and they are all as quick as a pop music video, is just so, down to the strand of hair that falls prettily across Jennifer Connelly's face.Today's movies' ""great SFX,"" however, are simply the effects used in a bank advertisement on TV in 6 months.Also like many ambitious modern movies for a general audience, the writers couldn't figure out what they wanted to accomplish. They started with some interesting ideas and then couldn't find a way to resolve them satisfactorily. Story threads were spun out, never to be integrated into a fabric that was satisfying. Characters more interesting than the leads made appearances and were then dropped. (The psychopathic detective being the main one. Why did he even exist?) The film's world, for some reason, is noir-ish. (Cough, cough, Blade Runner). It's just a style, though, and an obvious one for a world that is always night. Otherwise it's not organic to the film. Here's one place the writers could have challenged themselves. Since the world is being run by aliens trying to figure out humans, in order to save themselves, why not make the setting 'inappropriate,' the opposite of noir? I'm thinking the set of 'Happy Days,' but in sepia. How much weirder would that have been? But of course the requisite sci-fi tropes must be obeyed, unless you want to do something new and more interesting.The first appearance of the aliens almost brought me to laugh, but that's a personal thing. I was reminded of the aliens in the first Star Trek original series episode. The aliens are almost all interchangeable, except for a really powerful one, a somewhat considerate one, and a young one. All the scenes with them are wooden and terrible.The moral of the story is practically in quotes, with big flashing arrows, toward the end of the film. The lead character tells the last alien that the soul isn't located in the brain's memories, but in the heart. And then he clicked his ruby slippers and sailed off back to Kansas.Our hero bests the powerful alien--the ""boss"" at the end of the highest level of your video game--then uses the spaceship city's structure to create the environment where he can re-meet the luminous but vacant Ms Connelly.The movie had something of a classic Twilight Zone vibe to it, and the mystery of the Beach is interesting at first. It's interest comes crashing down when it's revealed to be a poster on a brick wall. This wall serves as the fuselage for the city/spaceship. When it's broken down, however, there is no catastrophic decompression. The detective just lazily drifts out into space, while the rest of the cast stands around. This leads, obviously, to the idea that we haven't reached ""reality"" yet in this universe. The writers though, apparently didn't see this or . . . . what? So Twilight Zone-ish, but Rod Serling could have done it better in half an hour on a shoestring budget.",Dark City

493,Mrdurandt,Baffled by the stellar reviews!,1,6 May 2020,"A friend suggested it by saying it was the best Sci-fi movie he's ever seen. Boy, was I disappointed. But I'm not going to express my opinion here. Instead I'm going to make a comparative judgement based on solid characteristics that can be empirically verified. First, the plot: That's where my only point goes. It was unique and something I haven't seen in many if any movies before. But that's about it. Second - pace: I had to drink several red bulls to keep me awake till the end. Slow pace is an understatement. It drags endlessly. Third - CGI: Considering this movie was made in the late 90s, there is no excuse for the, mildly put underwhelming CGI effects. I felt I was watching a B rated movie. Fourth - acting: That was the most surprising aspect for me. I have seen all the main actors and actresses in other movies and comparing their acting there to this one, I have to say, it felt like they just breezed through the whole thing and were in it just for the money. In other words, solid actors, bad acting. Fifth - costumes: I couldn't understand why the bad guys were all fans of Hellraiser. It just made no sense to me. Yes, I understand the dark, gothic theme, the creators were going for, but hey could've shown a bit more creativity instead of making a vanilla version of Pinhead. Six - bad guys: They can make people fall asleep, have special powers but just decided to walk real slow, grind their teeth and use knives??? Please! Why would anyone be scared of slow and incompetent bad guys? And seven - flat earth much? LOL. In conclusion, this could have really been an amazing movie if someone really creative took a chance on it. Sadly this movie will only appeal to hipsters, and Jennifer Connelly fans. Recommendation - stay away from this movie!",Dark City

But depends mood n time I like one of them than the rest one. Something I write down below not really contains valid spoiler, it just another story.You see many years ago life in that city was founded on the light, peace and love. Then one day John Murdoch noticed something, a weird thing about his memories that he didn't remember exactly. It was bright, innocent and somewhat intriguing, like a dream of a man about the best childhood memory, and about somewhere called ""Shell Beach"". He decided to find it out, after all it was probably a beautiful place, unlike any other place that ever existed in that city.What he didn't realize was that Shell Beach had a mystical secret. The more curiosities it received, the more difficultly it could be found, until one day it took over. It became a abnormal place & a normal place in the same time, where people can't located anymore although everyone should to knew where's it. Not just it either, seem any place in that city's imaginative n unreal in some surreal meaning. And the daylight that even never ever existed in recent memory of all people. Nobody could remember exactly the last time when they face the daylight, or the sun except some images blurry n uncleanly in their childhood.People were trapped and there was no way out, they had won. It was numerous long years before he - a human - fought back. Get rid of all the images in his memory, removing his belief, and most importantly removing anything which he thought he knew. It was hard at first to get himself to agree to this, most had a fascination and admiration for the memory that they just couldn't let go away, but he needed to free himself and make out something to resolve that secret, for the greater future life.He did this for you, that's right it was all so you can enjoy the freedom and fun of the world. What made us human not just inside us, it's out there, it's the sunshine, the beach, the air, it's Earth. So next time, when you're questioning our existence, just know that if it weren't for Earth you wouldn't even be here. (Happy Earth day :F)",Dark City
495,worm666-681-108183,Just boring,3,28 October 2018,"After reading some rave reviews about this movie I decided to give it a chance. Especially because it was supposed to be influenced by Hellraiser. But I couldn't make it past 45 minutes. The idea could maybe be interesting, but to be honest I couln't care less. If reality changes every night and nobody knows, what's really the problem?Anyway, there's just no mystery. It's just scene after scene after scene. You never connect with someone. It's like everyone's half asleep all the time. This happens, that happens, and something happens after that. It's just boring.",Dark City
496,spaceplant,enjoyable,8,7 September 2010,"***WARNING: SPOILERS***Dark City is a strange tale of memory and identity. The movie creates a sort of dreamy atmosphere; some people remember what they did just before going to sleep, but sometimes these things they remember doing have not actually been experienced by their bodies, though their memories seem to suggest otherwise; bodies awake with a whole new set of memories while the old set becomes like a dream forgotten after waking from a deep sleep. Really, when one thinks of someone, is that person thinking of that someone's face, or behavior? Which of the two is most important? Which one is the person?The way the conflict is resolved is a bit sudden. It uses a deus ex machina to completely liberate everyone from the Strangers, an alien species whose background is still rather unknown even by the end of the film. The main character is a bit crazy at times; in one particular scene, he becomes overly dramatic when everyone goes to sleep.But overall, Dark City is a decent movie that presents the spectator with an atmosphere that is like no other. It makes one think about the philosophical problem of identity and memories. I've watched the Director's Cut version only, so I can only recommend that one.",Dark City
497,christopher-bair,"From ""The Crow"" to revitalizing ""Metropolis""",10,17 April 2004,"Alex Proyas may be well known for directing music videos, but it was _The Crow_ which set him apart from many directors attempting to make the leap from comics to the big screen. Even with the tragedy of that movie, the film is well worth watching.Proyas took dark fantasy to another level with _Dark City_, in which a man awakes suddenly with no memories of his immediate past, nor of his name. A murdered woman and a frantic phone call alerting him to imminent trouble motivates the protagonist to start his journey on discovering who he is and what has transpired.In a world where the sun never rises, people suddenly fall asleep across the metropolis at precisely 12 o'clock, and lives and buildings change every day, the main character's delusional breakdown furthers the more he witnesses. Between a wife he doesn't know, a doctor trying to help him come to grips with who he is, and a police officer hunting him for a murder spree in which he is implicated, the viewer is taken on a fast paced ride of suspense and fantasy that mirrors the 1927 movie _Metropolis_ (_Dark City_'s DVD has commentary by Roger Ebert discussing the similarities).I highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy suspense, dark fantasy, dynamic character-driven stories, or generally any good movie with a well done script and visual effects. You will not be disappointed.",Dark City
498,alan-851-763577,Different,8,28 September 2010,"I have to admit that it's a masterpiece in its own way. I gave it 7 points (9 points for the idea and 5 points for realization). Overall picture is similar to matrix, because it questions our existence and views our population as puppets of some other beings. Also the main character is the chosen one who can bend the present reality like Neo from matrix. Similarity with matrix put aside, the idea is original and deserves at least 9 points, because it leaves a unique kind of emptiness after you've seen the movie. Now, i'll explain why i gave five points for realization. Direction was fine, nothing special and also nothing disastrous, but the actors weren't that good, somehow the main character's emotions felt fake and didn't pass the confusion that an amnesiac should have. Also Kiefer overacted the hunchback professor with the stuttering, but that is only my opinion - that a perfect movie should have everything in place. Although that movie had some misplaced elements it is quite close to perfection.",Dark City

The Film also goes on to question the future of humanity and the possible unlocked potential we possess.Therefore not only does it look great it also raises strong philosophical themes. The noir detective feel is delivered emphatically reminiscent of blade runner.The film will have u hooked from beginning to end.

500,Raxephion,Intelligent and enjoyable introspection into the human psyche,7,18 April 2004,"Let's get one thing straight. All over I read comments that Dark City is similar to The Matrix. BAH!!! Dark City came out a year before The Matrix, which makes The Matrix SIMILAR to Dark City. PERIOD. ****Possible spoilers**** Now onto the movie...well, one word, brilliant! Dark City has to be one the best psychological sci-fi/thrillers I've seen in a long time. The cinematography is top notch, the acting elegant, the story line intellectual yet unpretentious. Alex Proyas does an excellent job of exploring the metaphysical and psychological questions of reality, self and being. The concept of individualism is examined and questions are raised, but seldom answered which is good since individualism is heterogeneous. What strikes me most is the intricate relations (or lack thereof) between future actions and past memories and how memories can (or can't) influence behaviour. The idea of genetically modifying personalities for observation is original and again questions are raised about what being human is all about. The aim of the movie is to try and establish what it is that makes us tick, and I think this is cleverly represented in the visual effects by the analogy of clocks and spirals. We all know old-fashioned clocks operated by the winding down of a spiral. The `Strangers' needed to know what it is that made humans tick, (thus creating the whole experiment) but also realising that their time was slowly spiralling down. All in all, I find Dark City to be an intelligent and enjoyable introspection into the human psyche, skilfully presented and excellently executed.",Dark City
501,maxonfilm,Wow! Freaky isn't it!,10,6 October 2003,"Before ""The Matrix"" changed our views on computers, there was another film that challenged people to look outside of ""the box"" and quesiton reality. The film I speak of is ""Dark City""!""Dark City"" is a brilliant, dark and twisted story about a city of unsuspecting humans who are a part of a gigantic experiment by a group of soul-less aliens. The aliens hope to learn about the human soul in the hopes it will save there race from extinction.From there, the movie begins. As in ""The Matrix"", a savior for the human race is chosen. In this film, it is not a nerdy computer hacker but a confused man (named John Murdock) who wakes up to find himself as a fugitive of the law and wanted for murder. This part is portrayed by Rufus Sewell. Rufus does a great job as the lead and would-be savior but the true performances come from the supporting cast....The first is Jennifer Connelly who plays Murdock's wife, a sexy club singer who's life is flipped upside-down as she despereately tries to patch up her crumbling marriage to Murdock.The second is Kiefer Sutherland who plays a Dr. Schreber, a dim-witted and crippled scientist who is forced night after night to ""edit"" people's personalities for the alien's experiments.Then there is William Hurt who plays Inspector Bumstead, a depressing detective who is still mourning over the loss of his lovely wife.The final is Richard O'Brien who plays Mr. Hand, one the dark, albino aliens who imprints Murdock's memories in his head in hopes of capturing Murdock.From there the movie takes off. It is filled with mystery, action and questions...tons of questions. Are the memories in your head your true memories? Who are you? What is your true purpose?The other brilliance of the film is the unbelievable setting which is a cross between the 1950s and the 1980s. From the saucy night club to the cheap hotel, to the upscale police station to the rundown theater. It reaks of ""Metropolis.""The movie's story is stunning, the acting superb and the setting is to die for. Rent this film and watch it! Let the quesitons begin!!!(10 out of 10 Stars)",Dark City

Keifer Sutherland give arguably his best performance ever in this film, even if as a ""supporting"" actor. If you enjoy Sci-Fi and are a fan of Inception or The Matrix, you owe it to yourself to rent this flick and watch it. Do yourself a favor and watch the Director's Cut if you can find it... if not, ,avoid possible spoilers and mute the opening narration until Sutherland looks at his pocket watch.The Editing is fast but tight, averaging almost one cut per 2 seconds at its fastest.

505,Spider_Jerusalem,What the Matrix should have been,9,21 June 2004,"Many young people saw the Matrix and got really taken in with the entire notion of perceived reality vs true reality. This is not a ground breaking concept but the Wach. Bros packaged it in a polished, high energy action flick replete with gratuitous Hong Kong violence and women in tight leather pants. Dark City does not need to rely on such base devices to get its message across and it doesn't need to drive away at rather overly vague chosen one plot devices to move the action forward. The simple fact that Dark City was able to do everything the entire Matrix Trilogy did in one movie and do it better should speak for itself.Right away, the first thing one sees is this movie is far more 'grown-up' than the Matrix. Instead of slogging from one tired action sequence to the next, the story is calmly paced like a slightly up tempo film-noir flick. The special effects may not be as flashy as the Matrix (with all its slo-mo, explosions, morphing, etc) but it actually manages to better convey the atmosphere of this 'Dark City' better despite this. As if superior atmosphere and pacing were not enough, this film also deals with emotions far better. The Matrix felt like a teen in many ways - all the characters could have been people in a high school (Neo/Trinity-angst-ridden teen couple, Morpheus-knowledgeable mentor teacher, Agent Smith-mean spirited Principal). Dark City had adult characters with a full range of emotions. Also, though this may be because they were working with better material, the acting seems far better (particularly when one compares the two protagonists).It should be said that simply comparing this movie to the Matrix does not do it justice. It is just so much more. My advice would be to watch it and come to your conclusion.",Dark City

It could be described as a modern SF film noir.The performances are adequate, with the exception of Kiefer Sutherland. His hammy portrayal of a mad scientist is straight out of a 50s B-movie.Most of the film's lasting popularity can be attributed, I think, to its themes and the questions it raises. Unfortunately it does more than just raise certain questions. It states that there is an answer to one big question (what is it that makes humans special, and differentiates us from the soulless villains in the movie?) and Proyas' answer pretty much ruined the film for me.

511,prgarrett-12208,Banal made magical,9,27 June 2021,"Alex Proyas's 1998 movie succeeds in turning banal tropes into something close to magical. With major cinematic nods to Fritz Lang's _Metropolis_, David Lynch's (disastrous but stylistically influential) _Dune_, and _The Matrix_, (and even _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_ and _The Empire Strikes Back_) _Dark City_ cleverly transposes a graphic novel format into a film populated by live actors, while paying reference to New Weird novels including M John Harrison's _Viriconium_ series, Jeff Vandermeer's _Finch_, and China Miéville's _Perdido Street Statio_ and, particularly, _The City and the City_. In turn, its own influence is clear and can be traced into contemporary drama including _The Man in the High Castle_, _Altered Carbon_ and _Mr Robot_.The work isn't driven either by plot or by character: the narrative structure knowingly obfuscates a fairly simple plot, and William Hurt (especially), Rufus Sewell, Jennifer Connelly and even Kiefer Sutherland (who I'm certain could have been allowed more licence for subtlety, if that's within his range) manage to bring presence and authority to stock characters. Similarly, the dialogue is mostly borrowed from noir novels, but is delivered in a way that seems both weighty and, occasionally, witty; and the portentious Trevor Jones soundtrack is balanced by delicious mambo vignettes of jazz classics sung apparently by Jennifer Connelly (but actually by Anita Kelsey).What makes this movie succeed is its style. The watcher is drawn into a narrative that moves with apparent complexity through a cinematically stunning milieu, with superbly arranged and photographed sets, and is, as a result, utterly caught up in the moment: the illusion of subtlety is at least adequate compensation for the actual lack of depth.The overly dramatic and sentimental finale is a let down but, overall, highly recommended.Buy or rent on Amazon Prime, using Amazon Smile to drag even a few tiny cents back for Jeff Bezos.",Dark City

Everything about this film is amazing. The acting is great. The story is outstanding. It may be the most original storyline I've seen in a very long time. The BEST thing about this film is the mind-blowing visuals. I was just completely blown away by this film. Renowned film critic Roger Ebert gave ''Dark City'' 4 stars and compares it to other sci-fi masterpieces like ''2001'' and ''Metropolis''. He also calls it one of the best films of this decade and he is most certainly right. It's a tragedy that this film bombed at the box office.

Kiefer and Rufus are great actors and look really freaky. The sound and visual effects bring a lot to the movie.

516,Goblindegook,BRILLIANT!,10,11 September 1998,"This movie took a very long time to hit the theaters here in Portugal, after its premiere at the Fantasporto's 1998 edition, quite some months ago. I was losing hope of seeing it on the big silver screen, but then my eyes landed on the movie's poster when I was just passing by a local theater. I held no second thoughts and hurled myself inside to buy a ticket.The movie opens with Dr. D. P. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) introducing us to a powerful breed of aliens, which he refers to as ""The Strangers"". They possess the ability to manipulate the properties of the physical world. However, and despite such skills, they are dying. Their only hope revolves around unraveling the secrets of immortality in the ways of the human soul. In order to accomplish such studies, they built a city and populate it with the object of their experiments.The viewer is then presented the disturbed John Murdoch (played by Rufus Sewell), who wakes up in a bathtub, suffering from severe amnesia. He moves to the bedroom next door and is horrified as he finds a prostitute's corpse lying on the floor. Extremely confused, Murdoch is compelled to flee after receiving a mysterious warning phone call.As Murdoch escapes, he is confronted by a group of phantasmagoric individuals who attempt to capture him, fortunately failing to do so. After the incident, John Murdoch begins to look up his identity, learning about his name, his past and his wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly). He also discovers that he possesses the same strange abilities as ""The Strangers"", but is only able to use them when caught in desperate situations.Meanwhile, police Inspector Frank Bumstead (William Hurt) is assigned to investigate a serial murder case, John Murdoch being the prime suspect. Bumstead is convinced of Murdoch's innocence but is unable to disprove his involvement in the crimes.These four characters embark in a story that keeps feeding the viewer with clues, but director and writer Alex Proyas masterfully rearranges them so that they make no sense or have no importance until the very end. The movie relentlessly unwinds the plot at an impressive rate and in the correct timing. And no pauses are made to explain the things that are going on. Therefore, you'll have to pay close attention to the succession of events, or you'll end up in the dark.Speaking of darkness, this is one very bleak movie. The sets draw inspiration from the 1920-1950 period, and everything is kept in the same dark style. The city was brilliantly constructed and reminds us of motion pictures such as Tim Burton's ""BATMAN"" (1989) or Ridley Scott's ""BLADE RUNNER"" (1982), with tall gothic towers scratching a sky of endless night; and buildings rooted in the gloomy, abandoned streets down below. There are canals filled with murky water, and secret underground passages where ""The Strangers"" live in.Alex Proyas' ""DARK CITY"" oozes style and perfection. It is an excellent science fiction film about a man's quest for his identity and the memories that define him, only to find that the true nature of humanity lies in the heart and not in the mind.",Dark City

We discover, as Murdoch gradually does, the true nature of The Strangers and the fate that has befallen the citizens of this topsy-turvy world as the story unravels.Deliberately underplayed, the characters that inhabit this caliginous world might seem cardboard at first, but upon the film's full revelation it should be fairly easy to understand why. Careful never to reveal too much too soon, Dark City takes you on a journey that is alien, eerie, a bit unnerving and so much fun.This film is not for everybody.  Some people I discussed it with found it boring.  I, on the other hand, was mesmerized from beginning to end.

I assume John is referring to a location somewhere near the area of the groin.This a puerile attempt at allegory dependent on anthropomorphism. The zenith (or nadir) of the ridiculous is embodied in a limping, almost inarticulate Kiefer Sutherland. The strangers seem a cross between ultra-orthodox Jews and escapees from Planet X.

First, and admittedly by writer's choice, there was no ""truth"" to go back to.  The ""Dark City"" was not an Earth hideaway, or strictly in the minds of the human guinea pigs but instead off in outer space.  The humans had no original identity to aspire to find and recapture.  I would have preferred the plot to focus on that aspect.Second, as most contemporary Hollywood plots, it disintegrated into a special effects war between the hero and the alien race.

As a member of the first camp, I suspect that the film went over the heads of the majority of naysayers. While the film tends to polarize opinion much along the same lines as another visually amazing film, Blade Runner, there's more at work here. The expository style that annoys some viewers is an integral piece of the story telling.  The viewer is encouraged to share the experience of characters searching for the very nature of reality.  It's more than a little ironic that the naysayers perhaps identify most with themajority of the City's inhabitants, who live the unexamined life, never questioning the biggest of lies.",Dark City

I saw it reviewed on Amazon and I bought the DVD, along a bunch of others, purely out of curiosity.Then I watched the movie. Fantastic. I actually cried of joy. I rate it now among the best five movies I ever seen, and I have seen a lot, about half of those were sci-fi. Perfect in all aspects, story, scenery, effects, and the ending made me grasp for air. Not a defect in my opinion.I will tell nothing of the actual happenings, chance is you have seen it. If you have not, there's not a reason on Earth not to rent or buy it immediately.The DVD edition is also well done, with a cinemascope version on one side (meaning is larger than 16:9), and the 16:9 version on the other, with all the appropriate extras.

533,ithelog,This movie made one of my worst days worth of living.,10,7 February 2001,"This film is immersely captive. Those who know what this film is, would very likely have heard the good things said about this film. The first thing you have likely heard about this film is the fact that it bases on same original concept the Matrix does. Don't worry though, the differences are that remarkable that having seen the other does not give much of clues to the other.By now I declare to be one of those who consider that Dark City is better film than Matrix. Many have said that and actually I have not heard anyone to claim the opposite. Be warned though, this film is completely different beast than Matrix - different Matrix could ever be.I feel rather impressed currently. I have finished watching the film some half an hour ago. Time has passed just enough that I have watched the extra material the DVD disc provides.The name of the movie gives all it out. Dark City. It tells the feeling. It tells what you are going to see. Not murky or greenish depressive world like in Matrix, but utterly dark. You'll going to see something that has more pessimism in it than anything in Matrix. In that sense this movie could be compared to Delicatessen where world is dirty and cruel, but where Delicatessen only has the artistic touch, this movie has well hidden plot as well. I say well hidden, because you are not going to know exactly what is going on until in very end of the story. You would receive half truths all along. Where as Matrix gave out there about all the secrets in very early and the rest was action, the Dark City let you live it within the mystery not knowing how deep or far it goes.Word of warning for Matrix lovers. This is not an action movie by nature. At least not in the degree Matrix is. This film has a lot more action in it than films like The Seven for example, but the action is not that glorified like in Matrix. The action seams a lot more real. I mean the presenting of it, not the physical manovers. Well, where in Matrix the self was boostable, in the Dark City that is very limited. Don't expect ultra jumps or anything fancy, the 'tuning' is something else. The differences make sense to you when all secrets have been revealed. At that point you might wonder what you have been expecting. After all, this is not Matrix. This is artistic, dark, science fiction movie and far better than Matrix. This is such a movie that I don't regret a minute that I bought the last copy of it from the first shop where I saw it.",Dark City

Brilliant casting, brilliant special effects (understanding what it takes for us the viewing public to be engaged), heart felt, concise and most of all haunting.

535,johegn,A perfect nighttime movie,10,10 June 2006,"I'm not saying the acting was perfect, i'm not trying to say the story was told in the most professional way or all by rules of film-making. It wasn't at all an up-tempo film Hollywood style with lots of explosions and rapid smart dialogs.But, somehow, unlike most films with few exceptions, it had the capability of putting you in a certain mood. A mood of inconvenience, because you become one with the character John Murdoch, mostly thanks to Sewell's acting. Maybe it's because when I've seen this movie, it's always way past midnight, but I guess it's part of the ultimate experience from it.The thing is I've only felt this way about a movie once before, and unfortunately, I can't remember the title of that movie, only that it ended with a picture of an ocean, and an alone man on the beach, leaving us never knowing if he would ever meet his girl again or not. I love when a picture put that enormous hill of emotions in your heart, and just as many questions in your head. That feeling, that mood.Most of the actors has received bad reviews for this movie, not least on this forum. But in my opinion, Rufus Sewell is doing his part very well. First so uncertain, then slowly growing into his role. Keither Sutherland, in a pretty uncomfortable role as a scared, weak doctor does it surprisingly good. William Hurt is hard and scarred, but soft on the inside. I guess the actors are telling more about their parts than the script itself. Generally, all the actors seem to have captured this feeling, this sense, that colors all throughout the picture, making the picture. You are not watching it. You are in it. You are John Murdoch.I'd like to end with a quoteJohn Murdoch: ""When was the last time you remember doing something during the day?""It sort of reveals the touch of it. If you haven't seen it, see it, in the middle of the night! If you've seen it daytime, see it again at nighttime. Not because you're tired, but because it's dark.",Dark City

Although there are certain amateurish scenes in the film, it doesn't harm the whole a bit. The storyline is really quite good when you compare it to the other stupid alien movies, the revelations during the movie are also satisfying. The color formations, the light effects, the filters, the looks of the streets, the camera angles and all the other things that make up the ambiance are all perfect(which I give a lot of importance). Not to mention the special effects are over-perfect for a movie released in 1998. So if you like sci-fi movies with a good plot and a good storyline, this is the movie for you.",Dark City

It has extremely interesting characters, a coherent plot, darkly beautiful sets, cool villains, believable special effects, and talented actors who seem to enjoy their roles.The one weak link? Keifer Sutherland. He hams up his Peter Lorre impression until it looks like he jumped out of a Bugs Bunny cartoon. (Remember the ones with the short sickly looking mad scientist and the big orange furry monster?)His poor take on the character could have been forgiven if not for the fact that the character also acts as a narrator. His opening monologue is not only unnecessary, but it completely blows away the joy and mystery one might have gotten from seeing the story unfold gradually.

If it's above 7.5 , its on. So despite my initial doubts while skimming through the movie on vlc, I decided to watch it solely because it was rated 7.7. And here's what I realized; that I wanted the last couple of hours of my life back. The plot of the movie failed to account for the crucial element of suspension of disbelief. At no point could I convince myself that what was playing on the screen was even remotely feasible. The old philosophical adage, ""Nothing comes from nothing"" kept repeating itself in my head as the characters played out their superhuman capabilities. Comparisons with ""The Matrix"" are inevitable because of the similar theme of their being a chosen one but The Matrix beats The Dark City hands down because of its superior graphics, tight knit plot and superb storytelling.I ain't gonna bother raising my doubts because there are far too many of them and none of them can be answered satisfactorily even after accounting for cinematic liberty.

Alex Proyas may not direct many films but when he does he gets it right. It's a shame then that Dark city did not get the full recognition it deserved, I myself watched it on it's opening weekend in the uk, in cinema that had no more than six people in it. When you compare this with the box office success of a film like the Matrix which while being a good film still falls well short of the tale being told in Dark City, it seems that people on the whole don't want intelligent science fiction but the typical pap that hollywood is too eager to churn out for the masses.

I watched it in wonderment, but when it was over all I thought was: 'I need to see this again.' So I saw it again and I have come to the conclusion that it is a modern classic. Visually this movie is astonishing. The story is also terrific (I won't go into details for those who haven't seen it) but what really struck me was what was underneath the visual quality and the plot. The film is telling us how lucky we are to be human. That's why we feel sort of sorry for the Strangers when they are defeated.

Also, we have a character who is able to transcend his or her given reality, realize it is fake, and then manipulate it to his or her own liking.  Also, the aliens in this film function very similarly to the Mr. Smith characters.The Truman Show:  Existence within a fixed space controlled by higher power where the subjects living within the space are unaware of their confinement and unable to explain the fact they have never left.Unfortunately, these faults take away from the film.",Dark City
550,violettesinfonie,Dark masterpiece,8,16 November 2002,"This is a gloomy but beautiful futuristic sci-fi horror questioning the essence of humanity and the role of memory in the composition thereof.The Dark City is a brooding metropolis suspended in space and controlled by a race of underground, super-evolved, uniform beings whom possess a collective memory and whom manipulate time and space.  This is known as ""tuning.""  This process occurs when the beings halt time at midnight, surface to the city, steal people's memories and inject them with new ones, as well as install new life circumstances and experiences.
John Murdoch is a person whom the tuners are unable to manipulate. Dr. Daniel Schreber is a psychiatrist whom is working with the tuners, being forced to aid in their search for answers:  What is the human soul?  What makes a human ""human?""    John comes to realize that his memories and the memories of all of his friends and family are artificial; mere injections of a serum.  Whilst attempting escape from the murderous clutches of the tuners, he seeks his wife, the answers to the questions he has about his true identity and memories, and escape to a utopian though fabricated place known as Shell Beach.This is a film that borrows from many other ideas and films in the genre but is nonetheless intelligently written and exciting. The story is presented in a visually appealing, unique, and often disturbing manner.   Its generally cynical perspective regarding the significance and authenticity of the human experience is overcome with the message of the ultimate ability of free will; humans can control their destinies and humans are more than the sum of their memories.  It only takes concentration and a requisite trip to a sunny setting that they had previously not known the route to.",Dark City

This is the #1 mainstream (mainstream = made for dummies) movie that speaks volumes to those on a deeper plane (Clockwork Orange is a distant #2). Takes about 10 to 20+ viewings to get it.

553,lachyshrives777,A lukewarm achievement,4,25 September 2010,"I saw this movie on the recommendation of other reviews here at IMDb. After looking through 5 pages of reviews, all of which were more or less glowing, I had pretty high expectations. While I found the film interesting at times, I was also disappointed. Firstly, the good points: -For a slow film, the suspense was fairly well maintained. -The noir-cum-scifi style was generally well executed. -The acting was good (though never great. Nothing that blew me away.) -There were a few memorable shots.These were somewhat overshadowed for me by a few things that really annoyed me about this film. For a $40 million budget, the main (unforgivable) problem was that it looked terrible. It feels like Buffy on a bad day. -90% of the shooting was awkward and about 50% looked positively unprofessional. For the first half of the film I found this incredibly distracting, by the second half I was sort of resigned to it. There was something about the quality of the film that reminded me of a late-night TV drama... Like it tried to be unpredictable with its cinematography but was in the end just clumsy and awkward mixed with a large number of obvious shots. -The special effects were used well in a couple of scenes, but largely left me thinking of old-school Doctor Who or Star Trek. Just a bit clunky and under-whelming. -The structure of the plot was bog-standard. The whole noir thing works fine, but they totally ignored any sort of relevant backstory. Spoiler: -I'm sure the ideas in the film seemed original before the Matrix came out. But the Matrix doesn't use inexplicable aliens. The fact that the Matrix's antagonists arise from the creations of humans makes the Matrix a lot more compelling. Dark City, on the other hand, uses a very dated idea. What, did they just abduct 1000 or so people and fly off? That's what it feels like. It feels boring and ridiculous. In conclusion: The best thing I can say about this film is that it was weird. For some, that in itself is going to be enough that you really like it. However, the disjointed plot and shooting served more to alienate me from the action and ideas, which, while 'adequate', were nothing too stunning or original anyway. If you're a big scifi fan, you may as well rent it if you've nothing better to do. But don't bother buying it.",Dark City

To truly understand a film, you must asses it on its individual merits at the time of its release, otherwise you are on a road to nowhere, critically speaking.I find Dark City to be a fine work of science fiction, adding a much needed chill factor to the genre. No guns, no schlock and best of all, Richard O' Brien is in it.The premise is solid and holds together all the way through; there is a sense of tragedy, drugged despair, fatigue and decay in all the scenes, compounded by the perpetual shadows.

The scene is near the end, after living in such an immense darkness, when John Murdoch opens the door, and everything is so clear, the sunlight is so bright, the sea is beautiful, and he walks to find the girl he's always love and they start to chat like they've never met (wonderfully beautiful performance by my beloved Jennifer Connelly)...

558,Great_Teacher_Musashi,Brilliant Fusion of Sci-Fi and Neo-Noir.,9,23 January 2004,"A sort of Sci-Fi meets Noir that's full of so much weird imagery it borders on Burtonesque. Set in a sort of Gotham meets Metropolis (the movie, not Superman's city) city in which there are many many subtle incongruencies which may not be noticed immediately by the average viewer. This movie demands a second viewing. The story is at the same time unique and yet grounded in certain staples of Sci-Fi and Noir. Although it opens with some cryptic background, it truly begins with a man waking up in a bathtub and realizing he has totally lost his memories. This provides a great clean slate on which to let the viewer experience his search for answers in this bizarre dark city. The script although confusing is well written with hundreds of little intricacies to be noticed on the second and subsequent viewings. The acting is on the whole quite good, Rufus Sewell pulls off the confused but slightly angry ""John"" very well, probably his best role in film. Jennifer Connelly (whom you may recognize from her Oscar winning performance as Alica Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind"") plays John's sort of love interest, tackling the complex character of Emma and lending her real emotion, it's easy to see how great an actress she is, and indeed she finally won the laurels after this movie with a string of great performances. Keifer Sutherland manages a great creepy character, his sort of breathing problem at first may seem overacted but ends up adding a sort of pace to his scenes, an urgency if you will. Richard O'Brien is just straight up frightening, honestly I don't think they did enough with his character, he could have been so much more menacing than they ended up using him for.Overall this film is an EXCELLENT one for any fan of sci-fi, noir, or really anyone who likes a great underrecognized film. I made it through without comparing it to the Matrix so far, but I have to say something first off, it came out BEFORE, so none of that ""matrix copy"" crap, and no I'm not saying the matrix copied IT, the movies have too much dissimilarity (especially in quality, Dark City is sooo much better than the Matrix) to throw around accusations of imitation.""When was the last time you remember doing something during the day?""",Dark City

With elements of noir mystery/horror and sci-fi all mashed together, you become a part of the main character's quest for answers right from the start. The cast is great although even at that time I would have liked an unknown cast in Sutherland's role. He still brings out a character that is somewhat different than most he plays though. Jennifer Connelly is always nice to see. A wonderful example of sci-fi and creativity that is often so lacking in Hollywood.",Dark City

561,thomas_e21,A laugh out loud parody of the neo-noir sci-fi genre,9,1 September 2014,"Alex Proyas has us laughing almost from the word go in this understated send up of noirish conspiracy thrillers. The opening scene, in which Kiefer Sutherland's' ridiculous mad scientist calls protagonist John Murdoch, screams silliness at the viewer from the word go: Sutherland's masterfully created stammering fool just one of many characters with which the plot is littered in order to reassure the audience that not only is this film not supposed to make any sense, it's actually actively trying to subvert the expectations of the audience with respect to good movies of the genre. Adding to Sutherland's expert delivery are the equally amusing Emma Murdoch - Connelly couldn't look more out of place singing in a jazz club if she tried, her attire, voice and manner purposefully not suiting the slender and smooth mood associated with such venues - the obviously deliberately named Inspector Bumstead - a title which perfectly juxtapositions the serious and the silly - and of course the cult comedy actor of choice Richard O'Brien. Many other fantastically ludicrous set pieces litter the film, including the main character showing more compassion for a goldfish he meets for less than a minute than for a hooker with whom he spends considerably longer, the ridiculous clacking of the alien species during their rituals and, of course, the final fight scene in which our hero and villain LITERALLY SHOOT PSYCHIC BEAMS OUT OF THEIR FOREHEADS AT EACH OTHER, whilst giving absolutely no explanation as to how Murdoch acquired this ability in the first place. Deciding that bringing the tropes of both science fiction and gangster genres crashing down around the ears of the audience isn't enough of a controversial move for one film, the creators of Dark City also have a quick little crack at the modern romantic complex during a scene in which Murdoch and his wife realise they have known each other for less than 24hrs but decide to have a go of it anyway. The story is needlessly complex, never explained in enough detail and at the end of the film very little is resolved and humanity is still left to drift through the cosmos in a floating city with no connection to reality at all, once again turning the expectations of the audience on its head. Yet some people insist on taking it seriously...",Dark City

How did I ever get past the stodgy acting, corny dialogue and clunky exposition? These are things that I usually don't even become aware of unless someone else points them out?If you haven't seen it, give it a try - it's got lots of merit, but for the most part it seems like the actors are being asked to do long division in their heads while their delivering their lines - that vacant look and lack of emotion just brings the pithy dialogue into focus all the more.",Dark City

Even the cinematography is better in my opinion, and Blade Runner is certainly among the best. Overall, I think this film captures the film noir style better. But there's just much more going on in this film. There are so many finely crafted points that bear repeated watching better than Blade Runner. Its also comparable to the Matrix. I think the Matrix is a better fit to the game boy generation with more mindless action to keep those with short attention spans from losing interest. But if you really want to be drawn into a movie where every piece of it has a purpose this has them all beat.",Dark City
564,mojo3381,Good but not that great.....I have some problems with some of it,6,14 February 2005,"Dark City starts out instantly grabbing your attention as John Murdoch wakes up in a dark bathroom in a bath tub with blood on his forehead. The lighting as well as the camera angles add to the mystery of what is happening even as John himself doesn't seem to know where he is or who he his. He looks around and finds a dead woman in the room, the phone rings and a man on the other end tells him he must leave immediately. After escaping from people who seem to be from another world and have the power to make people fall asleep he then goes about trying to find out what has happened. As the movie progresses he finds that he too has the powers that the other kind have. As you watch the movie a lot of questions go through your mind, but the writer does a good job in answering most of them. There are a few things that need to get cleared up however. The first of which is that I feel that if the world is to stop at midnight then it should just stop. Instead, the director has the people appear to just fall asleep. If this is happening one would think that more people would be asking more questions after they woke up on the ground or asleep at the wheel of their vehicle. Also, I feel the director should have included some type of TRUE love in John Murdoch and Jennifer Connelly's character. Instead it seems based on the fake memories that are given to them by the people from the other world. These are all minor problems that I found with the movie. My big problem that I have with Dark City is the final fight scene. How is one expected to believe that one man (John Murdoch), who has just assumed the other race's powers through what is told to be evolution due to the need of survival can fight off the entire race of the other kind? If his power is no greater than theirs, then they should be able to fight him easily. Instead, the director chooses to have a big fight scene between what appears to be their leader and John Murdoch. He chooses to make it look like some kind of mind concentration battle that came off a little corny in my opinion. If he was to defeat them it should've been done in a manor more consistent with a logical way for one man to beat an army. For example, after the final battle scene the leader, whom John Murdoch is fighting, is thrown into a water tower and water is sprayed all throughout the city killing the rest of the other kind since it is stated previously that they had a phobia to water. A more believable ending would be to throw out the corny fight scene and do just the water part. Aside from the final battle scene and the few other items I mentioned, I thought the director did do a good job. Other reviews that I have read seemed to agree with me, with many others also complaining about the final fight scene. The scenery and the world that they were truly in came together nicely. This movie offers an excellent plot with great visuals to go along with it.",Dark City
565,krish-kumar,Dream-like,9,26 September 2006,"Imagine there's no heaven. Imagine a hundred minutes of pure atmosphere. Imagine a hundred minutes of raw science fiction. Imagine a hundred minutes of psychedelic cinematography. It will be called Dark City.Probably the most overlooked movie of the 90s, Dark City is comparable to the likes of Blade Runner and the timeless Metropolis. It is a different from Blade Runner because the plot is more a picture in the puzzle than the puzzle itself. The classic sci-fi plot has been setup like a detective story. The story starts in true film noir style with a man wanted for a series of brutal murders. But he cannot remember whether he did them or not. In fact, he cannot remember anything. Thus starts a tale of discovery and a wonderful hundred minutes.What makes sci-fi movies fun is the transportation of the viewer into its world and Dark City does this well. For quite some time in the movie, the plot unfolds like a crime story - but slowly and creepily leading into its sci-fi elements. And when it starts, its a lot of fun. The Strangers start chasing Rufus. They find out much to their surprise that Rufus can also 'tune in' like themselves. And then there is a kid with superpowers and has a couple of interesting encounters with Rufus. And the unforgettable Jennifer Connelly. For once in a movie she is being sought after and plays the ingénue to perfection, unlike most of her famous ventures where she is nursing crazy protagonists. Her memories are mixed up by the Strangers and she does not remember who Rufus is. By the end of the movie, Rufus has to start wooing her again. Nice.What makes Dark City Dark City is the atmospheric canon of light and darkness. Dim lazy sets. A confused but determined Rufus Sewell. The creepy Strangers. Its a work of great imagination and packed a wallop when I watched it in an empty theater 6 years ago. Maybe this impact is what Manoj Night Shyamalan was talking about in order to stop studios' plans of releasing the DVDs of movies on the same day as their theatrical release. If somebody saw Dark City on DVD today they might never understand why its so good a sci-fi movie.",Dark City
566,deepusuman,One of the best. Could have been THE BEST!,8,14 September 2007,"The greatest pro of the movie is its script. And the worst part is the background score. This script has a slight flavor of ""The Matrix"" and the ""Neo-ness"". Just note that the later was released in 1999. Nevertheless it has its unique flavor of timelessness.The intrigue of the movie keeps your bottom stuck to the seat. And the end makes you feel like its worth it. The movie's concept is slightly weird, but I guess we are talking about a movie here! The lecture given by Dr. Schreber at the end of the movie is hilarious. There are moments in it when you feel nostalgic; but remember ""There is no time for romance John""!Recommended only if in a mood to try something different...",Dark City

568,davidporter,Think Matrix philosophy - without the hype and SFX,8,15 May 2005,"If you like mind twisting movies that stick with you for days/weeks and make you question the human existence and our reality as we know it, then DARK CITY is the film for you.Similar in philosophy to the later released 'The Matrix', the film is centered around a man (Rufus Sewell) who becomes suddenly and unwittingly aware that his world is not what it seems. The film kicks off with Murdoch (Sewell) waking up in a bathtub with no memory and a dead body in the same room. He has no recollection as to how and why he's there.As Murdoch attempts to put the pieces together he notices that at every midnight on the dot, apart from Murdoch himself, every inhabitant in the city falls asleep. It's then that he realizes that something even bigger than his memory loss is taking place.Alex Proyas (The Crow) manages to combine a tantalisingly interesting Sci-Fi screenplay with dark and drab yet beautifully mysterious cinematography and he pulls it off (once again). Although a box-office flop, it has managed to, through the years, collect and maintain a cult following which is well deserved.It isn't without it's faults, Rufus Sewell although adequate, doesn't steal the show (much like Keanu), and the talented co-stars (k. Sutherland, Connelly & Hurt) aren't utilised as well as they could be. The story does become slight complicated and a little ridiculous at times, but which Sci-Fi movie hasn't suffered from that affliction?! To summarise, think of 'The Matrix', minus the big name stars, special effects and hype, and multiply the philosophy and mystery by 10 (without complicating it, like the Matrix sequels did) and you end up with DARK CITY.",Dark City

571,nightseek,On first viewing ever: Director's Cut,9,17 September 2008,"Dark City Review:On first viewing ever: Director's Cut (contains plot spoilers so beware if you're still deciding between watching Original or DC)Now I've read on the forums after watching the movie that the original cut had an opening narrative that gives away the premise. Heck the trailer gives it away too. But I came into this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about. I was curious to watch the movie because it was referenced as Kafka Esquire. I'm just into the whole not seeing beyond the obvious type of movies. That and it was no.8 on IMDb's list of Kafka Esquire movies. The title definitely clued me in on what type of mood I would be in though. There were hardly any daytime sequences, except for that surrealistic last scene. Unlike most other movies, the dark nature of the movie actually is part of the plot itself and I found that; absolutely refreshing. Dark City is quite an experience in itself and even though it has its faults, mainly in its plot like most movie of its genre, it still doesn't take away from feelings it will create.The movie opens with fairly ominous overtones. The city looks bleak and you can feel something bad is going to happen. As it turns out, our moral senses are tingling. Our man, John Murdock, wakes up inside a chillingly lit bath tub full of water with blood on his face and a dead body on the floor. He gets phone call telling him to get out of there and quickly he does. His departure reveals a world that sleeps at once but carries on without notice. Our fugitive is being chased by overtly pale white men in trench coats. Their means are as menacing as their looks.At first they seem creepy but then soon they're revealed to be much more powerful. There in lies the first problem and that is that their threat is madly inconsistent. One minute they're shadowy men that lurks in the environment, and the next, they can not only fly but build the environment itself. Furthermore they can put the whole world to sleep at will as part of an experiment. How they can put drivers to sleep and not cause crashes is amusing though. Anyway, with this kind of power, what isn't within their reach? Well, apparently John. But that's because he has small powers himself; and even though he escapes with luck and timing, you get a sense that these omnipotent beings aren't quite as threatening as they first appeared. On that point, they aren't really a threat to mankind itself but rather just manipulative observers. And give credit to the film-makers for immersing us in that situation. We get glimpses into the confusion of what it's like to be a rat in an experiment. How cruel it is to see the people trying to explore why they can't remember past what is shown to us in the screen. It's quite depressing. At the same time, we can empathize with the Strangers for their curiosity to study us. Should a distant race happen upon Earth, it is reasonable to assume they would just pluck us up from our every day lives just to find out what makes us tick. What emotions do we have? What do we feel? What is our soul? Of course there isn't time to answer those questions as there's virtually no down time. In moments of character interplay, there is an underlying sense of dread in the air. When the characters aren't being introspective, the action itself is quite enjoyable. All the physical interaction is within the boundaries of the plot except when it comes to the climactic end battle. That's where it really shows its year of production. I can't really fault the movie just because I saw it a decade later. Although I did find it unnecessary within the confines of the plot. The movie set the tone as an intelligent sci-fi thriller. Most movies of this type tends to cross over to the action genre for it's climax so that is expected. Of course where it faltered slightly there it ended strongly in familiar fashion. Yes the hero now controls the world. He's the bad-ass and he wants the girl, let him have his glory in the sun and for us, the visual payout was just as welcoming. It ends on an excellent note, visually and metaphorically. By the end, the inability for the Strangers to catch Murdock can be explained away in logistical terms; a city is bigger than a maze. While I'm reflecting back on faults, I just want to talk about the physics. It's just off the wall. The water moves to nonexistent weather; there's wind suck-age by space wall even though they're surround by a force field; the detective doesn't expand once in space; and finally the hull of the ship is held by bricks! This is all hindsight nitpicking of course, as none of this hindered the sensation I felt as some of the situation unfolds. The sun creeping over the city was beautiful; the detective floating out to space, a sad lost; the water pouring out of the city, majestic; and looking at space through a brick wall; a hauntingly disturbing visual. So for me, even when logic eventually catches up to you, it still doesn't take away from the awe-inspiring magic this movie can drop on you in the moment. It might hinder future viewings but then again, when you associate a feeling with a certain scene, that feeling will probably be there on repeated viewings. On this single viewing though, I found the movie to be sci-fi at its best with its thought provoking premise, tensely choreograph moments, and well-conceived visuals. Even with its subtle flaws I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Dark City
572,vanjaana,Absolute masterpiece,10,20 April 2020,"A brilliant film! I loved every part of it and enjoyed it so much. The main actor kinda reminds me of Josef K. from Kafka's ""The Trial"" because of his confusion and for all he knows he's stuck and nothing makes sense. There's a scene where the alien guy floats in air that looks like Rene Magritte's painting ""Golconda"". Also the whole movie is methafor for modern society and what 'elite' society is doing to us. The ritch get ritcher and the poor gets poorer. We forget our past, we sleep on our lives. They want to break our spirits and destroy everything that makes us different to one another.

The acting was wonderful and I thought that Dr. Schreber was a wonderful character that won't be forgotten anytime soon. The special effects were spectacular and eye-popping. There was only one problem with the film. It felt like it was rushing itself. For some unknown reason the shots were no longer than 3 seconds and it felt like that the film was in a hurry to finish up and go home or something like that. I think that if Alex Proyas had given the film some more time and the shots were a tad bit longer in the apropriate spots. I think that Alex Proyas was worried that the viewer would be bored with the film if it didn't go fast enough. After viewing the film i received a terrible headache.

575,faraz2hot2handle,Perfect Science Fiction Film,9,11 November 2005,"Dark CIty"" is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It does not rely too heavily on special effects like most other science fiction films, and instead moves along on a great and quite mind boggling story. The Strangers who look strangely familiar, and the most evident one of all; the mad scientist. These characters make Dark City unbelievable and in a sci-fi picture you need to try to make it as believable as possible, otherwise it falls flat.the acting is excellent from the entire cast who portray their characters perfectly. the direction is perfect, i never get bored and it has some beautiful shots. the CGI is also excellent and adds to my enjoyment of the film a perfect science fiction film!!!!!",Dark City
576,ramaallen,Anticlimactic,3,24 September 2005,"This movie was not that good. It was both anticlimactic and had a pretty bad script. The concept behind it is intriguing: Who are we without our own memories. Are we still human? Very interesting, but the movie could have portrayed it better. I would give it a three just because of the idea behind it. The movie moved slowly, and although there are action scenes, they are no where near exciting. Although Jennifer Connely is great in other films, this one seemed as if she had never acted before. She rarely showed any emotion on her face. Rufus Sewell had this intense, almost crack addict look through out the entire movie, even in the end he carried this air of spaced out intensity that really hurt anything that he would otherwise say. Kiefer Sutherland did a good job playing the despicable scientist. Although his speech patterns were annoying (taking breaths between each sentence), they added to his character.",Dark City
577,ElijahQ,Maybe the worst sci-fi movie I have ever watched,1,1 April 2017,"I made the mistake in watching this movie because of the high rating, which is a mistake I may never make again. As the movie began I thought that the writing was supposed to be ironic, like it was being overly cliché on purpose as a joke, but then as the movie continued I slowly began to realize how uncreative the characters and dialogue were. Were there any jokes at all in this film? because the only thing you caught me laughing about was how predictable and banal the story line was.The characters were also bland, which could have been somewhat excusable considering the theme of erasing people's memories and personality, but this never even happened to any of our main characters. The main characters were completely immune to the main plot of the film and were still inexcusably shallow. The main character, the human with the same powers as the aliens, is supposed to be a human who is apparently ""more evolved"" and thus closer to the alien species, and this is how he has powers. It really makes no sense in general, but it also raises a lot of questions like why nobody seemed to notice his abilities until he was an adult who got abducted by aliens and lived multiple lives until finally he notices that he has incredible power during another one of many memory implant procedures.The obvious bad guys were both uncreative, self-contradictory and unrealistic. The ""aliens"" were, a bunch of screeching, cold-hearted (and yet still irrational), pale- skin, long-black-coat-wearing humans. They have powerful telekinetic abilities, but this didn't stop them from behaving like your typical slow-chasing, inefficient, knife-wielding villain. For a supposedly collective species, they sure were awful at working together and coordinating with each other. For an incredibly technologically advanced species, they sure were primitive in their philosophy and even naive in their science. For an alien species, they sure were anthropomorphic, both physically and behaviorally. For experimenters, they sure were willing to ruin their experiments and to be needlessly cruel to their valuable test subjects. There seemed to be no real method to their madness either. It was as if they expected that replacing people's memories every midnight would somehow one day give them a great insight but they had nothing that resembled a scientific method. Why this would be the way that the aliens chose to study humans is beyond me. Also beyond me is why they would go to such great costly lengths for such small returns.To top it all off, the entire story makes absolutely no sense; The very concept that the movie attempts to get at is completely contradicted by the ending of the movie. The idea is supposed to be that humans have ""souls"", that we are more than just our memories. John tells an alien that ""what makes us human"" won't be found in the brain and that the person whose memories he was implanted with ""was never him"". What does John then proceed to do with his power? He acts out the wishes of the person whose memories he was implanted with. What made him who he was, in the end, was nothing more than those memories. When he is free to do anything, to be ""himself"", he still reenacts the implanted memories by creating the beach and by meeting his fake wife. His wife and everyone else are then implied to behave exactly as how they were supposed to, rather than how they would ""freely"" want to act according to their ""soul"". The movie is an absolute mess that got nothing right.",Dark City

This film borrows heavily from City of Lost Children (1995). From the style of the filming, to elements of the plot - substitute memories for dreams. If you've seen City of Lost Children and enjoyed it then you will most likely enjoy Dark City. To compare Dark City to the Matrix is just nonsense... what's the similarity? Not being aware of reality? For starters Dark City predates Matrix and City of Lost Children predates Dark City. Even the name of 'Dark City' is a play off the French classic. If you are looking for films of a similar feel to Dark City, obviously City of Lost Children, but also, Metropolis, Dante 01, Delicatessen, City of Ember, Equilibrium, 1984, Soylent Green, THX 1138... the stories are not the same but the style of film is similar. Although Dark City is a Sci-fi movie it is of the dystopian sub-genre. It is filmed in a surreal film-noir style.
The plot is not that difficult to follow. Anyone getting confused at this film needs to pay more attention to what they are watching. It all but betrays the plot when we are introduced to the doctor.",Dark City
