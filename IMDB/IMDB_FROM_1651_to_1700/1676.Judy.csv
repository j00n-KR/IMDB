0,SnoopyStyle,terrific performance,7,14 October 2020,"Judy Garland (Renée Zellweger) arrives in London in 1968 to headline a series of showcase performances. She is struggling with addictions, health problems, custody of her kids, and a lifetime of pressure to perform. Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley) is the overwhelmed producer trying to keep the unstable Judy on time. It doesn't help when Judy's boyfriend Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) arrives. He becomes her fifth husband and one more disappointment. In flashbacks, a young Judy (Darci Shaw) is under tremendous pressure from Louis B. Mayer to perform.Zellweger's performance is terrific. Her only small flaw is her singing and that's not her fault. She is asked to embody both greatness and struggle. It's a high degree of difficulty. It would work better if all her singing is live and there is less of it. It leads me to the bigger problem of the structure of the movie. It should squeeze the movie down to her last two performances. The story has no ticking clock and feels meandering at times. The solution is to concentrate the timeline down to a couple of days. The opening with the kids can be better placed in a flashback. The best scene is the dinner with the gay couple and that would be a great antidote after the bad performance. It doesn't need Mickey's arrival and the quickie marriage. He's fine as the constant sycophant who disappoints. The structure flattens the emotional and dramatic tension of the film. Through it all, Zellweger's performance is terrific.",Judy
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Good lead performance, good film, good music, but nothing comes close to Garland's greatness",6,16 January 2020,"""Judy"" is a new British film from 2019 and as short as the title may be, you probably know immediately who this one is about. Most randomly, I remember a quote from Tom Hanks how you recognize some greats immediately from their first name, such as Denzel or Meryl I believe, and Judy definitely also fits into this category (no offense Judi Dench, your name is written with an ""i"" anyway). The center of the film is Judy Garland from beginning to end of these almost 2 hours. But first things first: The director is Rupert Goold and the screenplay is by Tom Edge, who adaptaed the stageplay for the big screen here. Both are no real superstars, but this is not surprising because here we have a British movie and not a Hollywood production, even if the character at the center of it all could not be any more Hollywood. However, even taking this into consideration, the director and writer are no truly big names and their most known works include the word ""Crown"" for both of them. You can check out their bodies of work if you want to know more. The title character is played by Renée Zellweger and she is safely on course to her second Academy Award win thanks to her performance here. It is pretty baffling honestly. She was a huge star, one of the biggest between 2000 and 2005, then did not play in really big films anymore before taking a really long break of many years when the 2010s started. So it seems almost that Hollywood has forgotten that she already has an Oscar (and several Golden Globes) and she will definitely be one of the least big-name 2-time Oscar winners. If she wins that is, but it seems she is pretty safe now. Most people now do not even remember that she is the one who breathed life into Bridget Jones, maybe the defining ""normal"" film character for female women in the first decade of the new millennium. As for this film here, I believe she gives a good performance. I am not really sure if the win is deserving, but it's alright. I must admit I have not been a big Zellweger fan at any point, but she surprised me positively here. Still, it must be said that I am sure a lot of her momentum is also thanks to the awesome make-up and hairstyling work in this film. I am glad they scored a second Oscar nomination there and this would be the one where I'd really be happy to see the film win, but in contrast to lead actress, chances there are extremely slim. So probably no repetition of the two wins like it happened for Gary Oldman's Churchill movie.Now, let's not drift any further away and take a look at the one we have here. Everybody knows Judy Garland still, also the people born a long time after Garland's untimely death. It is quite a coincidence that Zellweger was born the very same year that Garland died, actually just two months earlier. So she is 50 today and it is the 50th anniversary of Garland's death, or it was last year I should say. Maybe not a coincidence that this film was made now. Anyway, I am 15 years younger than Zellweger, so of course I also was not yet born when Garland died. This film takes us mostly into the later years of her life, actually when her death was not that far away anymore. However, there are many references back to Garland's younger years and with that I am not only talking about the actual sequences from around 80 years ago, but also words we hear in the key sequences of the film featuring Zellweger. Just take the doctor who says he was in love with Dorothy Gale. Or of course the powerful ""Over the Rainbow"" performance at the end and with that I am talking more about the crowd than about Garland and that was the one moment where this film really touched me and had me on the edge of my seat and I was so much in awe. Sadly, like I said, there weren't more moments like this because otherwise I would have given it a better rating for sure. But the film definitely went out on a high note and it was also nice because it was a rare moment when Garland really felt loved and you can see from beginning to end that she is all about making others as happy as possible, so they will show her how much they appreciate her, almost to a self-sacrificing degree. This includes the man she is with in this film, who in the end just becomes another ex-husband, one of many, and he was played by Finn Wittrock, 2-time Emmy nominee from American Horror Story, and the fact that I did not even recognize him, although I really like him as an actor, is also evidence of what a great job the hair/make-up crew has done with this film, even if everybody immediately only thinks of what they did with Garland, but she is not all of it. Anyway, back to the husband, you could think initially that he has nothing honorable on his mind because he is considerably younger and she is still a big name, but the longer the film goes, the more it becomes obvious that he really adored her and you also cannot blame him for how things turned sour between the two. So it feels sad she misseed another opportunity to find someone who loves her and keeps loving her from the bottom of his heart. Then there is also the story about Garland's children. They are another aspect where she so desperately wants to be a perfect mother, but sometimes it becomes very easy to see she isn't a natural (even if that scene with the three so close to each other in the wardrobe was really sweet, but again this was not the outside world, just a hidden place where they exist in utter harmony) and this was certainly one reason why they decided to stay with their father eventually, even if I believe the main reason was that they did not aim for a life on the road and Judy could not make it happen for them, at least not during this time of her life. Seeing her in tears inside the phone booth was still somewhat heartbreaking as she told her daughter she loves her and the daughter does not say the same back to her, which made it even worse that they decided against her I am sure. As for another child, there is of course Liza Minnelli, who was already a grown-up at that point and we see her early on too actually during the same time Judy meets her future husband.So it is a very serious film overall, sometimes a very depressing one too, but this could be expected I think if you know a bit about the character's life. The rare moments of comedy were mostly delivered by other characters (except the sarcasm), although ""comedy"" is already too much, let's say the moments that put something close to a smile on your face. I will just mention one example: the two gay guys, or especially the more extroverted from the duo. That was kinda funny, also with the egg that went really wrong. It was probably included to show how much of a gay icon Judy was and maybe still is today, also when these two start singing the song at the end. However, even these parts contain some gravity as we find out how homosexuals were discriminated against back in the 1960s still and while I don't think that discrimination isn't there anymore, we should still keep in mind that there may be worse things than perhaps that you are not allowed to decide your gender on your own. So from that perspective you can also call this film historically relevant because it tells us something about society and we should not take for granted that these times are luckily over. Now finally, one other thing I totally want to mention here are the flashback sequences to Judy's youth. This mostly refers to when we see her on the set of ""The Wizard of Oz"", which is certainly one of the worst examples of child abuse I have ever witnessed in a film. So while Garland is definitely not a saint in her grown-up days, you can really say that this period of year-long abuse turned her into who she became and that is truly sad. There was one particularly memorable moment when we have the girl (played convincingly by Darci Shaw) complain that she is so hungry, but not allowed to eat, so her shape stays the same while shooting. She gets pills, so she won't feel hungry anymore, but the consequence of these pills is also that she cannot sleep anymore, so she gets more pills that help her catch some sleep. Shocking really. Add to that that we find out her mother treated her really badly and did not only let it all happen, but even encouraged those who hurt her daughter so much. This is maybe the main reason why we see Judy try so hard to be a better parent because she knew what it was like to grow up without being loved and cared about. In addition, the other actors at the set of the film (especially those Judy's age) do not act friendly towards her either as we find out. She says it herself, but the ""birthday"" party was a ""great"" example. Still Judy was a headstrong girl at times as we see when she takes a bite from that burger or jumps into the water. However, these moments of rebellion against her chains were too rare and could not help her get out. Early on, we hear during one occasion also how she says that she would like to go to the movies like the other kids do, but of course she cannot prevail against all the grown-ups around her and also there she already has this urge to please in order to be loved, which makes her situation not exactly any better. It is all a dreamland, but for young Judy it was more of a nightmare. I think I read a while ago how Jackie Cooper (or Coogan) opened up about working conditions for minors back in 1930's Hollywood and that child actors basically had no rights at all and that is also what it felt like in this film. It was beautiful to see the camera switch and take us into the wonderous world of Oz early on, but still after knowing everything you find out in ""Judy"" about this old classic film's production, you will probably never see ""The Wizard of Oz"" the same again. I guess this will be all then. Finally, this is of course, even if more focus is on music, also a film about film with the flashback sequences. So if you are interested in these, then it is worth seeing. If not, it is as well.",Judy
2,Prismark10,Judy,6,21 December 2019,"Judy has a tour de force performance from Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in the last year of her life.Garland had no money, no home and in a custody battle with her ex husband. She managed to get a gig at the Talk of the Town club in London, as she was still celebrated in Britain.However Garland was a wreck. Middle aged but looking older, addicted to booze and drugs.There are flashbacks to the young Judy Garland on the set of The Wizard of Oz where movie mogul Louis B Mayer coerces her to perform by any mean even by plying her with pills.Director Rupert Goold delivers a meat and potatoes bio pic. It is all by the numbers and low key. Only a scene where Garland is taken for breakfast by two gay men stands out apart from Zellweger's acting.",Judy
3,mark.waltz,The end of the rainbow had plenty of ups and downs.,7,1 October 2019,"When Judy Garland was ready to go on, her audiences got the show of a lifetime. The heart she put into those shows was so filled with the love for her audience and those who supported her, and the love of performing. The play on what this was allegedly based upon is fortunately not the dominating source of this movie as it wasn't always a dignified look, making it appear that Judy would take any kind of drug she could get her hand on, even if it was to cure a dog from mange. Fortunately, that reference is gone, and while this does show Judy drunk and spaced out from pills, it also reveals how she got hooked and the disastrous outcome of that lifelong addiction.Renee Zellwegger (""Chicago"") tops her performance as Roxie Hart, a role ironically performed on Broadway by Judy's daughter, Liza Minnelli. She doesn't look exactly like Judy or sing exactly like her, but once you get past that, she truly becomes her. TV's Judy was Judy Davis, and Broadway's Judy was Isabel Keating, and it's tough to top those iconic performances. Zellwegger gets to dip into her soul, and what is revealed is not only the greatest female performer ever, but a woman of so many conflictions, tragedies and demons that her eternal humor makes her the epitome of the true survivor which her devoted fans to this day keep close to their own hearts.It's been 50 years since she passed away, and the legend hasn't faded. The story focuses on a period of time during her last year when she took a gig at the Talk of the Town in London to try to get out of debt with. Judy recalls various abuses while a child star at MGM, challenges ex-husband Sid Luft for the custody of children Joey and Lorna, visits Liza at a Hollywood Hills party (where she meets husband #5 Mickey Deans) and gets the London offer where she is greeted like a queen.There's support from her talented pianist (whom she hits it off with immediately), the challenges her young assistant must face to please her, and of course the audience. A gay couple greet her outside the stage door, and they end up hosting her for a middle of the night breakfast. Judy gets to see first hand the love her gay fans have for her, and expresses her disgust with the indignities they have had to face to find happiness over that rainbow. They are there for up to and past the end, giving a finale that is really tear inducing.Then there's her marriage to Mickey, happy at first, but even the strongest man can only take so much. This dismisses the fact that he was with her when she died, giving the impression that he walked out on her when she needed him most even though it is obvious that she pushed him as far as he could be pushed. She is not presented as perfect, and it is understandable why many people would be frustrated with her. But when she sings, all is forgiven. Renee gets to perform search Judy standards as ""By Myself"", ""Once in a Lifetime"" and ""The Trolley Song"", culminating in of course ""Over the Rainbow"".I read in one of the many biographies on her that what happens in the finale actually did occur (I cannot recall which book), and even if it is a simple legend that has been made up, it truly is a beautiful thought to think that could happen to such a wonderful performer in a time of crisis. This is not a perfect film but it is a perfect representation of a great lady whose legend deserves to live on forever.",Judy
4,nogodnomasters,What city is this?,4,23 December 2019,"The film shows Judy Garland (Renée Zellweger) during her last six months, on a drunken down slide with some minor flashbacks to her childhood where MGM messed her up with drugs during the shooting of 'The Wizard of Oz."" There was nothing in between. Not one happy song and dance with Mickey Rooney. While Renée Zellweger did a good job the script was horrible for a biopic. It would be like showing a senile Reagan after he was President and then a few flashbacks when he was in the movies, skipping over his political career. Big disappointment.",Judy
5,kosmasp,When the first name is enough,9,28 November 2020,"I reckon if you read this or just are interested in this - mostly and many already know who the movie will be about! Judy Garland - you just need the Judy part and it's not even an exotic first name. What is even more amazing than that little fact, is the main performance. I didn't recognize her at first and I have to admit for quite some time, I didn't think much of Renee Zellweger or her acting talent ... but boy was I wrong! I missjudged her immensely and she showed me ... well actually she showed everybody but others may have thought of her differently from the get go.All that aside, this is quite the mesmerizing movie. A movie that shows someone so well loved and beloved struggling. It is what makes us connect with stars more. Sometimes because generally speaking many want to see them fail, but also because it makes them human in everyones eyes. And the script and direction meet the performance and the quality of this is just immense. Great movie, if you're even (s)lightly interested in all that",Judy
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"Decent film, with an outstanding lead.",6,22 January 2021,"I have never before been so baffled by a movie, I found this one very difficult to review, and I will explain why, the movie itself did nothing for me, but the performance of Renee Zellweger, was nothing short of brilliant.I was aware that Judy had a hard life, I wasn't aware just how hard her life was. It doesn't put Hollywood, and those that pulled the strings in a particularly good light, she was a tool to make money from.It was nicely made, the story flows well, if I were more of a Judy Garland lover I may have scored it a bit higher, Zellweger is outstanding as I say, bits of it just left me a little flat. 6/10",Judy
7,classicsoncall,"""You won't forget me, will you? Promise you won't.""",8,27 January 2020,"Renée Zellweger has never given a finer performance. There were times in the picture she looked more like Judy Garland than even Garland herself, if you can appreciate what I'm trying to say. It pains me to learn how Garland's life was corrupted by Louis B. Mayer and the studio system as far back as 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"", when the daily regimen of pills and starvation kept her weight in line and made her unable to sleep. It would have been more informative if the picture revealed additional detail of Judy's life besides the occasional flashbacks, but it did demonstrate the pathos she encountered reflecting back on a career and marriage that had gone bust, while performing in London in late 1968. Her public rejection from the boos and jeers on stage in London was painful to watch, though her conflicted doubts about performing were largely self imposed via alcohol and self medication. I was aware that Judy Garland passed away at a young age, but didn't realize she was only forty seven when that occurred. Once again, the world missed out on a major talent who would have scaled even more insurmountable heights had she lived to perform into the Seventies, Eighties, and even quite possibly the Nineties. This film doesn't offer the definitive portrait of Ms. Garland, but as a microscopic look at the legendary performer, it's a film no fan should miss.",Judy
8,lee_eisenberg,entertainment lasts as long as it can,9,13 January 2020,"Judy Garland was one of the biggest stars of her time, and she remains one of the supreme icons of entertainment. But behind the veneer of the glamorous superstar, she was plagued by all sorts of problems (not the least of which was Louis Mayer's horrible treatment of her). Rupert Goold's ""Judy"" features Renée Zellweger as the actress/singer, on tour in London for what turned out to be her tragic end. Garland takes pills, meets with gay fans, and tries as hard as possible to maintain her act, even as she becomes increasingly erratic.Zellweger puts her all into the role, and won a well deserved Golden Globe for it. We can only wonder if Garland would've lived to be a ripe old age, had MGM not pumped her full of pills and let Mayer sexually molest her. I guess that the one saving grace of her death was that it spawned the gay rights movement, as the Stonewall uprising took place the day of her funeral.Anyway, this is a fine movie, both as a look at Garland's end and Hollywood's vicious methods of forcing its stars into submission. I recommend it.",Judy
9,jboothmillard,Judy,6,14 October 2019,"Just like Gary Oldman in Darkest Hour, I didn't recognise the star of Bridget Jones's Diary until her name appeared in the trailer, I was highly interested to see this film, directed by Rupert Goold (King Charles III). Basically, at age 14, during the filming of her breakthrough role in The Wizard of Oz, young Judy Garland, aka Frances Gumm (Darci Shaw) was told by her studio manager, Louis B. Mayer (Richard Cordery), that she had a gift that other girls do not have. At the time she was trying to surpass the success of Hollywood child star Shirley Temple. In the 1960s, Judy Garland (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Renée Zellweger) is in her forties, and performing with her two children. Following their removal from a hotel, due to non-payments, Judy is forced to return home to third husband Sidney Luft (Rufus Sewell), who has since divorced her. At a party, Judy meets nightclub owner Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock), and they become close friends. During Judy's teenage years, being friends with and acting alongside Mickey Rooney (Gus Barry), including in Babes in Arms, the studio demand she controls her appetite, and give her amphetamines. In 1969, Judy is told by her agent that there is an opportunity to perform and tour in Britain. The U.S. reception to her has cooled and become unworkable due to her growing unreliability during performances. Judy decides to embark for the UK, she finds it difficult leaving her two children behind, to be looked after by Luft. In the UK, Judy continues to perform unreliably on stage due to her addictions to drugs and alcohol. Assistants, including Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley), are called upon to check on her health and fix her make-up. Judy makes it to her own London première, but is late. But the fans are enthusiastic, and Judy is in top form during her performance. A flashback to Judy aged 14 reveals that she struggled being fed with pills and meeting scheduling demands. Back in 1969 in London, Judy continues to perform to strong audience applause, including during the ""The Trolley Song"" from Meet Me in St. Louis. During rehearsals, she sings ""Get Happy"" and brings her accompanist to tears, but there is increasing frailty of health. Mickey comes to London on a surprise visit which cheers her up. Judy still has trouble making it to stage on time because of substance abuse and anxiety. At one point, she is unable to recognise where she is performing, and slurs whilst talking and singing, which causes the audience to boo. Flashing back again, Judy aged 15 is approached again by Louis B. Mayer when she has become exhausted by her childhood schedule and following her rebelling on occasions. Back in the present, her sponsoring British agent has her examined by a voice specialist medical doctor. Judy says she had a tracheotomy years ago which weakened her voice. The doctor diagnoses physical and mental exhaustion and says she needs rest for recovery. Judy's relationship with Mickey is a support to her personal life and they marry, becoming her fifth husband. Judy is suffering being separated from her children; they however are happy in school in California. Mickey tells Judy that a money deal fell through, and she must stay in England to make ends meet. At her next performance, she passes out on stage and is heckled. Judy ends her touring engagement but returns for a last night on stage where she asks to perform one last song. She breaks down while singing ""Over the Rainbow"" but is encouraged and supported by the audience who sing the song themselves. Judy asks, ""You won't forget me, will you?"" Judy Garland died 6 months later. Also starring Sir Michael Gambon as Bernard Delfont, Bella Ramsey as Lorna Luft, Gemma-Leah Devereux as Liza Minnelli, Andy Nyman as Dan, Royce Pierreson as Burt Rhodes, John Dagleish as Lonnie Donegan and Fenella Woolgar as Margaret Hamilton. Zellweger is spot on with her look as the famous actress, singer and gay icon, and her singing voice is good as well, Shaw doesn't quite capture the same closeness, and there is good support from Buckley and others. Like Bohemian Rhapsody, it doesn't quite get into the full grittiness of Garland's health problems, but it does explore her devoted gay following well, obviously the memorable tunes are also splendid, I wonder if it is a little overrated by critics, but it is emotional enough, I could see it getting award nominations, and it does celebrate a Hollywood great, a worthwhile biographical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Costume Design, and Best Make Up/Hair. Good!",Judy
10,tavm,Renee Zellweger is fine as the legendary Ms. Garland in Judy,8,6 February 2020,"Mom and I both just watched Judy starring Renee Zellweger as the legendary Judy Garland during the last days of her life. It also shows Ms. Garland just as she was starting to get her fame as a teen while at M-G-M. It also mainly shows her spiral in drugs and drink in between her sold-out shows and her battles with her ex-hubby Sid Luft concerning their kids Lorna and Joey but we also see her joys when performing which Ms. Zellweger shows to great effect most of the time. In short, Judy as a musical bio can be both depressing and enthralling as entertainment and art.",Judy
11,BandSAboutMovies,Great musical scenes,5,31 December 2019,"I've been reading a lot about the deaths of beloved stars. Like Elvis, who struggling through his final concerts while raving in a mania about killing the karate instructor who he thought stole Priscilla from him to the point he had to be drugged into incoherence before dying from quite possibly overstraining himself on the toilet because all the prescription drugs had torn up his insides so badly. People who had everything but it felt like nothing, who lived supposedly charmed lives but had given so much of themselves away that there was nothing to do but, well, die.What can I say? 2019 has kinda been like that.So here's another tale of stardom not being as wonderful as it seems, based on the Peter Quilter play End of the Rainbow. This time, we're following the end of Judy Garland's career as she relocates to England for a series of sold-out shows at the Talk of the Town in London, only for things to fall apart all over again.Quilter went on record about the loose adaption of his play by saying that screenwriter Tom Edge wanted the story to be much more true and precise and have less fantasy sequences than his play.Critics have been all of the map on Renee Zellweger's performance as the lead. Me, I still can't come to grips with her new head, but then again, I'm not a woman trying to maintain my relevance in Hollywood. Far be it from me to demand that celebrities not get work done. She acquaints herself well with the musical numbers here to the point that there are moments to cheer about. And it never gets to Lifetime movie mania, so that's good. Or bad, because you know, I like to wallow in the mud when it comes to biographies.There's a scene in the beginning that feels lifting from Crazy RIch Asians as Judy and her two kids can't afford to stay in a room any longer. But instead of being a lesson in how hotel owners underestimate people, it's just to illustrate how far Ms. Garland has fallen.Finn Wittrock, who has been in so many of the American Horror Story shows, plays Garland's fifth and last husband, Mickey Deans.Sir Michael Gambon is also here as Bernard Delfont, or by his full title, The Right Honorable Baron Delfont, who was born in Russia as Boruch Winogradsky. He ran the Talk of the Town, bringing in big stars like Sinatra, Shirley Bassey and Eartha Kitt. As EMI's chief executive from 1979-1980, he also funding for Monty Python's Life of Brian at the last moment, worried over the religious satire in the film.Of all the movie, I really enjoyed the flashbacks to Garland's early life in Hollywood, such as her interactions with Louis B. Mayer, as he explains to her that the gift she has makes her better than other girls, but that it comes with a cost. Or a flashback to a date with Mickey Rooney where a studio executive interrupts so that she can take her amphetamines so she's not too hungry.There's also a nice moment where the two fans who see her every night are surprised that she wants to follow them out for an evening, ending with an all-night singing session at one of their apartments. It's a pretty emotional moment realizing that Garland has lost so much that these two fans represent nearly all she has left.Liza Minnelli said on her official Facebook page that she had ""never met nor spoken to Renée Zellweger"" and made it clear that she didn't approve of the project. She's played by Gemma-Leah Devereux from The Tudors in the movie.Speaking of celebrity, Jessie Buckley, who plays Garland's assistant in England, broke into showbiz on a reality show called I'd Do Anything. One week, she sang Garland's ""The Man That Got Away."" She's good in the film, but it seems to set up that there's going to be a moment of catharsis or learning between their two characters.That never happens, just a sort of feel good moment where Garland stumbles at singing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and the audience helps her finish it, before she asks them to not forget her. This is followed by the gut punch of learning she died six months later.I guess this is the opposite of a feel good movie. A feel bad one? A good cry? A reminder than maybe it's a good thing you never became a famous star? You can decide that for yourself.",Judy
12,sunwarrior13,Focuses More On Judy Garland's Character,8,30 September 2020,"Renee Zellwegger stars as Judy Garland in this biopic entitled,""Judy"". It was an Oscar winning performance and she definitely provide a wonderful performance about an icon in Judy Garland.The purpose of the movie is more about the character of Judy Garland and not a film depicting her life from beginning to end. If you want to see a movie about it,I would better recommend the Judy Davis TV movie mini-series entitled,""Me And My Shadows:The Life of Judy Garland"". If you want to know more about her, I highly recommend that you watch documentaries about her.As for this movie, it only focuses on two parts of her life: her struggles as a teen star and her life about the final stages of her life particularly during her London concert leading to her death at age 47. As I have stated earlier,it only focuses on her character and her struggle to find happiness in life. With the purpose of this movie,we get to see a better understanding of Judy Garland and Zellwegger provided a great performance that would make the audience feel for her especially the lack of happiness she felt in spite of the success she has experienced in life.",Judy
13,studioAT,A tragic film with a stellar star performance,7,25 October 2019,"With a wonderful, surely award worthy, performance from Renee Zellweger this is a good film indeed.Capturing both the onscreen and off life of the much loved star, this is a tragic tale of fame too young and then a star on the decline.It is a credit to Zellweger that we believe totally that she is Judy, forgetting that this is not a documentary.This film deserves all the praise it is receiving.",Judy

15,preppy-3,A real mixed bag,6,19 October 2019,"Supposedly factual account of Judy Garland's last concerts in the UK in 1968. By that time she was flat broke and ravaged by drugs and alcohol. It shows how she struggled to keep it together and met her last husband Mickey Deans (well played by Finn Wittrock). It also has flashbacks to when she did ""Wizard of Oz' and was forced to take drugs.On one hand I loved this film. Zellweger looks and sounds nothing like Garland but she sings well enough and gives out a good performance. On the other it's dark. slow-moving and depressing. Also I question how factual it really is. Also--again--Zellweger looks nothing like Garland and having her sing Garland's songs was not a good idea. So I liked it but didn't also.",Judy
16,CinemaSerf,Renée Zellweger has something to be proud of...,7,15 November 2019,"Renée Zellweger must be up for an Oscar nomination for this, frankly, dazzling performance as Judy Garland. She really does shine and, to a certain extent, help us who didn't experience Garland at her peak first hand get a sense of just what a true - and flawed - star she was. Clearly, there will never be another original, but I don't think Renée is trying to be a mimic in this film - anyone who attempted that would really be on a hiding to nothing. That's is why I found her performance so captivating - it is personal. Sadly, though, there isn't much depth to the rest of the film - Jessie Buckley (good in ""Wild Rose"") stands out, but otherwise it is a little humdrum.",Judy
17,writers_reign,Ee Bah Gumm,9,4 October 2019,"First things first: Renee Zellwegger as Judy Garland is right up there with Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf and I personally can't rate anything higher than than. Cotillard deservedly won every acting award going from Bafta, Golden Globe, Oscar, downwards and though politics may well prevent Zellwegger replicating that in a perfect and unbiased world Zellwegger would equal Cotillard's haul. One minor beef: Get Happy ws one of several Garland signature songs and everybody and his uncle Max know it was written in 1930 by Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler so how some ego-tripping Sam Smith (who he?) contrived to take sole credit - i.e. music and lyrics - for the song and why imdb aided and abetted him by printing the erroneous credit is something that needs to be addressed.
Although I have compared Zellwegger and Cotillard it's not so easy to compare the respective films; La Mome (La Vie en Rose in the UK) was a soup-to-nuts bio-pic featuring Piaf whilst Judy doesn't pretend to be. Although we do get flashbacks of the young Judy at MGM the total footage amounts to less than ten minutes with the bulk of the running time focussed on the five weeks Judy played The Talk Of The Town in late 1968, early 1969. For a movie about a major vocalist it's very light on songs and Zellwegger opts to perform them herself rather than miming to Garland. All this to one side and allowing for the fact that it is set 50 years ago, thus failing to address todays' audience (average age 30-35) this is still a brilliant film with a standout central performance. Roll on the dvd.",Judy
18,grantss,Wonderfully engaging and emotional journey,8,3 July 2020,"1968. Legendary entertainer Judy Garland is suffering financial troubles, causing her ex-husband Sid Luft to take custody of their children. With possibilities for work in the US limited she signs up to do a series of shows in London. Could this turn her fortunes around?A film that starts as an interesting biopic and ends as an engaging and emotional journey. I was expecting a dry telling of a stage of Judy Garland's life but this film is so much more than that. We see and feel the ups and downs of her life, realise what it took for her to become a star, the habits it formed and how these took a toll on her health, see the depths to which one of the greatest performers of the mid-1900s had sunk and experience all the self-doubt and anxiety she felt.It's quite a roller-coaster ride: just when you think she's on a winning streak, something sets her back. Quite sad, and frustrating, especially as many of her problems were self-inflicted.However, it is not the plot nor direction that make the film. What tips the film into the 'great' side of the dial is the performance of Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland. She is mind-bogglingly brilliant in the role, showing wonderful range and capturing the vagaries of Garland's persona at that point in her life: funny one moment, anxious the next, energetic and vivacious then depressed and alcoholic.Just when you think her performance can't get better, she sings, and does so superbly! I was convinced that the director got a professional singer to do the songs and then overdubbed their voice track. To my surprise I found that Zellweger did all the singing items herself, after receiving several months of singing training.Truly an acting tour de force. She well deserved the 2020 Best Actress Oscar she received.Great film and a wonderful, warts-and-all tribute to Judy Garland.",Judy

Instead remember that the Academy of Motion Picture of Arts and Sciences seems contractually obligated to honor at least one mediocre imitation of a beloved dead person every year, and the worse the movie around that performance is, the more likely they are to win.""Judy"" is a colossal bore, telling us nothing we don't already know and not even coming close to capturing the one-of-a-kind quality that made Judy Garland so special. It's a crime that Renee Zellweger somehow gobsmacked the entire entertainment industry into giving her every conceivable acting award for this movie because she's not even that good in it. To be fair, there's only so much she could have done with such a lame movie, but she doesn't even capture Garland's mannerisms or, worst of all, her voice, and if you're going to make a biopic of Judy Garland but not capture her defining characteristic accurately, then what the hell is the point?I can reel off about a dozen actresses off the top of my head who gave better performances this year.

22,ferguson-6,that last year,7,27 September 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been 80 years since THE WIZARD OF OZ was released and 50 years since Judy Garland died. So why do we still care so much? Of course the obvious reason is that, for many generations, her adventures as Dorothy Gale from Kansas marked the first time many of us kids could put ourselves in the shoes (mine weren't ruby sparkles) of a lead character in a movie. Her fantastical journey ignited our imaginations and whisked us away to fight witches and flying monkeys, while making wonderful friends in a corn patch and enchanted forest. Oh, and that voice! However, there is another side to this coin. Judy's story is also an example of the dark and tarnished side of Hollywood ... she pulled back more than one curtain.Renee Zellweger (Oscar winner for COLD MOUNTAIN, 2003) stars as Judy Garland, and her performance will likely put her in line for her fourth Oscar nomination. The film basically covers the last year of Judy's life, and director Rupert Goold (TRUE STORY, 2015) is working from a script by Tom Edge adapted from Peter Quilter's stage play, ""End of the Rainbow"". There is no Lollipop Guild here. Instead, the harsh realities of Judy's life are explored. The film opens with Judy and her kids, Joe and Lorna, performing on stage ... and then being unceremoniously denied a room at a nearby luxury hotel. See, Judy's career is in a bad way (admittedly undependable and uninsurable) - as is her health. She is broke, has no home, and offers for roles or performances have dried up. She ends up at her ex-husband Sid Luft's (Rufus Sewell) home, which after some former-spouse bickering, is where the kids stay.With no other real prospective gigs, Judy accepts an offer from Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon) to perform at his Talk of the Town theatre in London. Most of the film covers her time in London, and the challenges for all involved. She's 46 years old in the winter of 1968, and though her voice no longer carries the sublime purity of those early years, Judy still has incredible stage presence and an ability to connect with the audience. The challenges occur for her assigned assistant Rosalyn Wilder (who served as a consultant on the film, and is played here by rising star Jessie Buckley), as well as Judy herself. She misses her kids, and is battling loneliness and an addiction to pills - causing her to rarely eat or sleep. When her ""friend"" (and fifth husband) Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) shows up, Judy's attitude perks up, but her already questionable dependability falters.Flashbacks to Judy's teenage years at MGM are used to portray how the studio and industry took control of her body, soul and career. Watching studio head Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) bully young Judy (played by newcomer Darci Shaw) by pretending to be a father figure while keeping her weight in line with a diet of cigarettes, diet pills, and soup, is just painful. These scenes, including those with young Judy's frequent co-star Mickey Rooney, help us understand why she was in such a state by the time she hit London. Ms. Zellweger embodies the blend of frailty and determination and talent, as well as the insecurities that simultaneously drove Judy and held her back. Of course, few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy, but Zellweger admirably brings the appropriate strain and pain to the songs she sings for the movie, including ""By Myself"" and ""The Trolley Song"".Born Frances Ethel Gumm, Judy Garland first hit the stage at age 2, and never experienced a ""normal"" childhood or traditional relationship. Despite her immense talent, she was never able to find peace with the pressures of performing. Years of abuse led to an early death, not long after she finished her London run. The film never backs away from the tragic story, but also allows one of the brightest stars of an era to shine through. For those who only know Judy as that homesick girl from Kansas, or maybe also as the rosy-cheeked youngster on the Trolley in the holiday favorite MEET ME IN ST LOUIS (directed by her future husband Vincente Minnelli), there is likely a shock factor in seeing the broken icon in middle age. The film also deals with that always-present bond she had with her audience, especially with the gay community - although a certain sequence of the film seems quite improbable.For a film like this to work (it was not sanctioned by Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli), it all rides on the lead performance. Renee Zellweger beautifully captures both the tragic essence and the stunning talent of the late 1960's Judy Garland, an iconic and revered entertainment figure. The film allows us to understand the lifelong mistreatment and heartbreak of this woman, as well as the strength and joy she received while performing live. Balancing the ""early"" Judy with the ""later"" Judy was a brilliant way of bringing her life full circle. Ms. Zellweger's performance goes so much deeper than singing on stage ... she embodies the insecurity and frailties of a woman who was never afforded the opportunity to live her own life.NOTE: There was a 2001 TV mini-series entitled ""Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows"", based on daughter Lorna Luft's memoir, in which Judy Davis (lip-synching to Ms. Garland's songs) delivered an impressive and Emmy winning performance.",Judy
23,phd_travel,Worth watching for Renee,8,13 December 2019,This biopic has some good points that make it worth watching despite a few flaws. Firstly Renée looks and acts like her. Great job. Just one thing her singing isn't as deep and rich. Should have been dubbed. It was quite sad when they showed how she was hooked on drugs by the studio people during her childhood. Finn Wittrock plays her last husband. Well done concert scenes.Bad points. Unnecessarily narrow focus on her last concerts in London and meltdowns and some uninteresting people there like the concert arrangers. And then it didn't show her death.This movie is worth watching.,Judy
24,gradyharp,'I'm only Judy Garland for an hour a night',7,29 December 2019,"Peter Quilter's play ""End of the Rainbow"" has been transformed into a screenplay by Tom Edge and the biographical film is directed by Rupert Goold. Judy Garland (1922- 1969) is the raison d'être for this cinematic outing, despite the fact that it focuses only on the very sad ending of her life.Some sense of Judy's Wizard of Oz beginnings is offered in a sluggish and heavy handed opening - Darci Shaw is the early Judy being confronted by Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) about proper behavior and attitude- and then the film dives into the end of her career and life of the important artist as she struggles with a failing marriage and lack of enough funds to support her two children Lorna and Joey, her 'chance' for final success in London, and her very real problems with alcohol and drug addiction and stage misadventures.
Renee Zellweger is the impersonation of Judy Garland and conveys her appearance and mannerisms and singing well. The voice in the film is Renee's, and while she doesn't have the infamous wobble/tremulo of Garland's vocalizing, the sight and sound work well.The 'tribute' to Garland is unfortunately restricted to the final year of Judy's amazing career - making the temperament, drugs, alcohol, and unreliability of performance the emphasis. Yes, Zellweger offers a fine performance, but for those who remember the stature of Judy Garland, this film will be a sad experience.",Judy
25,JamesHitchcock,A Star Is Torn,8,24 October 2019,"""Judy"" might be described as a partial biography as it does not deal with the whole of Judy Garland's life and career but with two episodes. The main emphasis is upon a series of concerts she gave at London's ""Talk of the Town"" nightclub in 1969, not long before her death, but there are also several flashbacks to Judy's teenage experiences making ""The Wizard of Oz"", today probably her best-known film, in 1939.Judy has gone down in legend as one of Hollywood's most tragic heroines, a hugely talented actress and singer whose career was damaged by her demons of alcoholism, drug abuse and anorexia, demons which also played havoc with her personal life- she was married five times- and were ultimately to lead to a tragically early death at the age of only 47. Now show me a tragic heroine and I'll show you a heroine- whenever a famous person becomes known as a tragic hero or heroine the truth is almost certainly that such a description does not do them full justice and that their life contained as much triumph as tragedy. (Marilyn Monroe is another film star who comes to mind).This film does not really challenge the popular view of Judy Garland, but it does try to put it in some sort of context. We see the teenage Judy being alternately flattered and bullied by studio boss Louis B. Mayer. Mayer is shown as obsessed with Judy's public image; he forces her to take amphetamines to prevent her from putting on weight and interferes in her romance with her co-star Mickey Rooney. The ghosts of Judy's past continue to haunt her during her stay in London. She is still painfully thin, and although some of her performances at the ""Talk of the Town"" are excellent, her substance abuse issues mean that she is not always at her best. When she turns up drunk for one concert she is booed off the stage. She is still suffering problems in her personal life. She is involved in a battle with her third husband Sidney Luft for custody of their children. She marries her fifth husband, nightclub owner Mickey Deans, but they are soon quarrelling.I had not seen Renée Zellweger in a film for years- I still mostly think of her as Roxie Hart, Bridget Jones or Beatrix Potter. She took a break from acting between 2010 and 2016, and ""Judy"" is the only one of her films I have seen since her comeback. All I can say, however, is ""welcome back, Renée"", because ""Judy"" must count as one of the highlights of her career. Yes, her Judy is a tragic figure, a woman with not long to live and torn every which way between the conflicting demands of Mickey, her children, her addictions and her loyalty to her fans, but Zellweger also makes us realise just why, in her heyday, she had become one of the world's greatest and most beloved stars. Particularly affecting is the scene where she breaks down while performing that iconic song ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" but is able to finish it with the assistance of two loyal gay fans. (Yes, I know that song is sentimental corn syrup in its purest form, but there are times when even sentimentality has its uses).For every ""star is born"" movie, to borrow the title of what is probably Judy's second-best-known film, there is at least one drama on the theme of ""a star is torn"". It has long been a showbiz cliché that life in showbiz is no bed of roses and that fame can only be bought at the cost of personal happiness. The script of ""Judy"" may seem that well-worn cliché to the letter, yet Zellweger brings such zest and compassion to her performance that she manages to transform the film from something clichéd into something out of the ordinary and well worth seeing. I hope that the Academy will remember her when the nominations are announced for next year's Oscars. 8/10",Judy
26,blanbrn,Tough look at the final year of a past prime fading legend who shined for one last time.,8,4 October 2019,"""Judy"" is not a biography type film as it's a focus and showcase on the final last year of actress and singer Judy Garland's(in a wonderful performance from Renee Zellweger) life. As after being flat dead broke and again divorced and at a point in her life where no one wants to work her, it's clear she must do something to support her even if it means leaving her children behind. So it's off to London during 1968 to perform standup concerts at an all night club.Garland most famous for her 1939 role in ""The Wizard of Oz"" has flashbacks of those moments yet many memories of the set time were painful with abuse and being bullied by the director and casting mangers and crew. Now it's like much of this has become a reflection and past ghost haunt Judy's life. Was this what lead to her personal demons of addiction of alcohol and drug abuse?(you the viewer can make the call after watching). Still aside from it all this elegant lady though losing some of her singing voice still lives and dresses in an elegant manner and is filled with much joy and humor.Thru it all it was clearly no dream or ""Over the Rainbow"" life for Judy as the journey on the yellow brick road was rough, tumble, and rocky as love was not meant for lasting as evidenced by her 5 marriages, plus life was cruel when Judy died way to soon and young the next year in 1969 at the young age of 47. So I like many ask what might have been if not for the apparent overdose that took her, still ""Judy"" is a well done picture a reflection on a legendary icon who shined despite dark clouds over her.",Judy

Then she grows up into an adult who just never got mechanics to cope with growing up.The irony of the story is well told with Rene Z doing Judy's last London tour with flashbacks to her terrible story.

Garland had so much power as a singer, blinding, brilliant, overhwelming power, and Zellweger simply doesn't. And when so much of the movie is people talking about how amazing Garland's singing is, Zellweger's more modest talents make it hard to believe in Garland as the radiant star whose name could fill a concert hall. Sometimes she comes close, as in her remarkable final song, but this is a case where dubbing a Garland impersonator would have been a very good idea.Still, it's a terrifically enjoyable movie.",Judy
30,MOscarbradley,Walk on hot coals if necessary but only for Zellweger's performance,7,10 October 2019,"This year the Academy may as well just forget about nominating five actresses to compete for the Best Actress Oscar, (though when you think about it, there isn't much 'competition' involved), and just hand it over now to Renee Zellweger whose performance as Judy Garland in the film ""Judy"" is, what we tend to call, a shoo-in. Zellweger is simply magnificent in the part; a barn-storming, tour-de-force in an otherwise largely mediocre film. She may not look much like Garland nor does she particularly sound like her, (Zellweger does her own singing), but what she does do is 'act' Garland in a way that is totally transformative. You simply forget you are watching Renee Zellweger; you are really looking at Judy Garland.Of course, this is not strictly a 'biopic'. It only covers the last few months of her life and the now infamous Talk of the Town concerts with the occasional flashbacks to ""The Wizard of Oz"" and how Louis B. Mayer and the studios mucked up her life. It's a film that proudly parades before us every cliche in the biopic book, ending with perhaps the cheesiest 'there's a lady on stage' scene in the history of movies but, of course, none of that matters much since Zellweger is seldom off the screen. I just kept wishing she had been given better material to work with, (it's based on the play 'End of the Rainbow' by Peter Quilter), but if anyone out there thinks Renee's hogging the screen and even, God forbid, going overboard, there's always Jesse Buckley who, as Judy's London 'minder', not only manages to hold her own but shows just what a damn fine actress she is in a totally thankless part.Of course, no Judy Garland picture would be complete without some 'Friends of Dorothy', here reduced to a couple of London fans who go to see the show every night and hang around the stage door, a la ""All About Eve"". In one of those scenes that absolutely shouldn't work but does, they even manage to take her home for some badly scrambled eggs. Unfortunately they are also at the centre of that truly cheesy ending.

32,dromasca,melodic drama,6,19 October 2019,"There is in 'Judy', the film directed by Rupert Goold, a scene that could be worth an Oscar. Renée Zellweger who plays a Judy Garland beyond the peak of her artistic career, prematurely aged and overwhelmed with personal problems, climbs on stage for the first of the London shows that maybe could save her artistic career and earn her the money that would allow her to keep her two younger children. In the 3 or 4 minutes that the scene lasts we see the woman stricken until then by doubts and problems regaining her self-confidence under the lights of the stage, making contact with the audience that adores with her when she succeeds but is ready to drive her off the stage when she fails, transforming herself in the actress and singer full of charm and charisma who had once conquered the world.Filmed in a single shot and with the actress most of the time in close-up, this scene also represents what this movie could have been. Unfortunately, not only this is the best scene in the film, but it is also repeated several times with increasingly diminished effects, and almost the rest of the film is far from its level and the ambitions of the filmmakers.It may be that Renée Zellweger will received, at least, a well-deserved nomination for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. But the film disappointed me, although it did contain a powerful and interesting story. Judy Garland's life is portrayed in the film in two parallel paths: that of the former star in a financial and moral crisis, struggling to keep her children and - through flash-backs - the period when she transformed from a an anonymous teenage girl in Dorothy from 'The Wizard of Oz' and from here to a world-famous star. The problem is that the parallel is very obvious, the ideas are few and quite trivial, and their repetition has a negative effect on the audience who understood almost everything from the first 15 minutes.There are quite a lot of ideas in the script, which, developed, could have made the film more interesting. London in 1968 was the place and the time for a significant cultural revolution and, in parallel, of a conflict of generations and styles between entertainment music (to which Judy Garland belonged) and the pop and rock music of the younger generations. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are mentioned in passing, and that's it. Judy Garland and her song 'Over the Rainbow' had become symbols of the LGBT rights movement which was taking off. To date, there are disputes about the reasons for this adoption, it was a good opportunity to dig deeper. Director Rupert Goold (at his second feature film) chose to bring the issue into the film through a secondary and somewhat anecdotal-sentimental story thread. What a pity. If 'Judy' had the ambition to use the wave of rebirth of the musical genre started about three years ago with 'La La Land', the opportunity to make a memorable film was missed.",Judy
33,ThomasDrufke,"Somewhere Over the Rainbow, There's an Oscar Win",7,20 October 2019,"Much like Gary Oldman in The Darkest Hour a few years ago or Glenn Close in The Wife last year, it seems like Renee Zellweger completely overshadows the movie itself as the titular, Judy Garland. She transforms into the tragic music legend of the mid 20th century to give what may be the best performance by an actress all year. Perhaps only outshined by her co-star Jessie Buckley, who stunned in this past summer's Wild Rose. The movie is forgettable overall, but Zellweger is worth the price of admission herself.7.4/10",Judy
34,Cineanalyst,Performing to the End,7,23 October 2019,"There may be a trend here of biopics of classic Hollywood stars going to England to die. There's ""My Week with Marilyn"" (2011), ""Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool"" (2017), and ""Stan & Ollie"" (2017), the latter of which is especially similar in that both pictures focus on the stars past their prime and trying to revive some of their success on the English stage. It's an effective, if gut-wrenching, formula, though. In ""Judy,"" we modern spectators are placed in the same position of the star's contemporaries. Sure, there's studio boss Louis B. Mayer and his MGM cronies who hooked her on drugs set up as baddies and a supporting cast of Garland's family members, but most of the characters surrounding Judy within the picture--reflecting the audience outside it--standby and watch her perform until she, quite literally, cannot perform anymore. Especially in a one-star showcase such this, then, the appeal rests almost entirely upon the actress inhabiting the role. And even for this movie being set at the end of her career, this is a tall order given that the star is Judy Garland, the greatest actress-singer combination in recorded history. So, kudos to Renée Zellweger for managing to resemble Judy's presence, and I'm taken aback that she also sings and sounds anything like Judy really did.Besides Zellweger being amazing in a career-topping performance (and for an actress who accomplished the unlikely feat of creating a likable and memorable protagonist in a rom-com, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (2001), that's saying something), some other aspects here work fairly well. The flashback structure wisely focuses on Garland's most-beloved film, ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939), as a touchstone, without ever actually showing it or any other of her pictures. In the present, two members of Judy's audience are represented by a gay couple (the ""friends of Dorothy""), which aptly references the star's lasting appeal as a gay icon and ties her personal struggles to the historical ones of the LGBT community. There's also much delay and build-up to Zellweger's first go at belting out lyrics like Judy, which is additionally and misleadingly set-up to be a fiasco--although there will be that, too. Initially, the camera lingers in long-take close-up on Zellweger singing, to enhance the uncanny and transfixing effect of her transforming into Judy. Later, the camera will twirl over her performance. Garland and the 1954 ""A Star Is Born"" remain among my all-time favorite performances and films because they heart-breakingly reflect real life (which, if anything, is more tragic than either of these pictures). In ""Judy,"" a similar effect is realized in the proscenium performances mirroring the character's off-stage woes, until the performer gives us everything she has left to give.",Judy

37,tabuno,One of the Best Performances of the Year,10,23 October 2019,"Oscar winning Renee Zellweger (Chicago 2002) portrays Judy Garland in an amazing and so authentic performance that is also Oscar-caliber material. The director Rupert Goold is spot on in an unusual narrative that isn't really a traditional chronological story like John Elton's Rocketman (2019). Instead Judy is a much more difficult execution that takes a slice of life Lost In Translation (2003) approach and instead of a cultural immersion into Japan, Judy immerses its audience into the very life of Judy towards the end of her life along with well executed flashbacks to enhance the present moments that Judy is presently experiencing on the screen. The naturalness and the excellent editing of everyday moments that emotional captivate makes this movie quite special in its complex but compelling delivery in both song and performance acting",Judy
38,briancham1994,Incredible performance,7,17 July 2020,"Renée Zellweger totally deserved the Oscar she got for her performance in this movie. Her portrayal of Judy Garland was very tragic. The film shows both younger and older periods of her life to show the kind of pressure she was under. Her performance really saves the film which would just be really average otherwise. It is more about character development than plot progression because, as we know from her history, there is no happy ending for Judy Garland.",Judy
39,Thanos_Alfie,Judy Garland...,7,25 February 2020,"""Judy"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the life of Judy Garland focusing on her concerts in London in the winter of 1968. Those series of concerts were sold-out and many people wanted to go and watch this legendary performer.I liked this movie because it was based on true events and it was about a person who was loved by many people around the world not only for her beautiful voice but also for her personality and what she has been through. ""Judy"" shows us what was also happening at her early life as a young girl in some movies and shows. Finally, I have to say that I really liked the interpretation of Renée Zellweger who played as Judy Garland and she was simply outstanding. She deserved the Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.",Judy
40,zkonedog,A Biopic That Will Impress Even The Genre Die-Hards,9,12 October 2019,"When it comes to film genres, I consider the biopic to be one of my favorites. I absolutely love when a historical figure is brought to life in the present time and able to be examined in the context of history. Because of this, I've watched a lot of biopics and as a result have become rather picky/knowledgeable about the ones I like or don't like. This one is a winner through-and-through.For a basic overview, ""Judy"" tells the story of Judy Garland (Renee Zellweger). It mainly focuses on her 1968 tour of London as a middle-aged woman, but also flashes back to earlier points as she prepares for the Oz role that would make her a household name and labors under the incredibly constrictive Hollywood studio system of the 1930s/40s.Garland is such an interesting figure because she is essentially the poster-child for the ""child star turned odd"" tragedy trope. However, ""Judy"" makes the argument that its titular star was not a tragic one, but rather simply a product of her circumstances and environment. Director Rupert Goold makes a very convincing case that Garland's seeming neuroses are rooted in her mistreatment by Hollywood executives (and even those who should have been looking out for her) as a young lady (barely even a teenager). It is fascinating to watch her story play out through that lens rather than simply ""she went a little crazy"".Of course, such a character-centric piece is going to need a star acting performance, and that is exactly what Zellweger gives. She has to be the favorite for the Best Leading Actress Oscar at the moment. Truly a role that could define the rest of her career.The music in this is also tremendous, as befitting any story about Garland. Her live numbers on stage are in turn inspiring, entertaining, and often incredibly emotional.Overall, ""Judy"" is about as solid of a biopic as has been made in quite some time. Not only does it nail the ""fun stuff"" (music, visuals, acting, etc.), but it tells a very coherent story and makes an interesting point about the life of such an enigmatic figure.",Judy
41,eddie_baggins,Zellweger ensures Judy is worth a watch,6,28 January 2020,"Once or twice a year you bare witness to a film that within itself is nothing much of note but due to a singular transcendent performance becomes something worth talking about, one of those 2019 films is Judy.A time specific dramatic biography of famed and tragic entertainer Judy Garland that follows the superstar in the later stages of her life as her profile dwindles and she takes up a series of gigs in London in financial desperation in the 60's, Judy leaves a lot to be desired in the overall scheme of things but thanks to the likely Oscar winning turn of its leading lady Renee Zellweger, Rupert Goold's feature is worth seeking out.Those looking for a warts and all examination of Garland's life will be fairly disappointed by this focused effort but watching Zellweger literally disappear into the role of Garland is a site to behold as she inhabits Garland's very being, from her specific mannerisms through to her renowned singing voice.In a career that's already had it's fair share of accolades and noteworthy hits, Zellweger is likely to never be better than she is here in what very quickly becomes a powerful and raw portrayal of a human whose difficult upbringing in the spotlight and raising up under the control of cold-hearted businessmen lead to an unfortunate place.Everything around Zellweger is relatively ho-hum with Goold unable to make much of supporting characters like Jessie Buckley's kindly Rosalyn Wilder, Finn Wittrock's charming Mickey Dean or Michael Gambon's business owner Bernard Delfont, with most of the feature feeling like a glorified TV biopic but whenever his leading lady takes the spotlight, Judy becomes a powerful piece of storytelling.Watching Zellweger fall apart in times of distress, show moments of happiness as she dreams of a better life or most impressively take to the stage in freakishly on-point performances, is gripping stuff and while you wish that the world around her was more memorable, cinephiles and Garland fans will find much to savor in one of best individual performances in years.Final Say -It feels like there is still a lot left yet to explore cinematically in the life of Judy Garland but thanks to Zellweger's incendiary lead turn, Judy is still an important piece of the overall puzzle.3 omelettes out of 5",Judy

43,TheMovieDiorama,Judy clicks her heels three times to transport us to a world of melancholy and self-destruction.,7,17 October 2019,"Somewhere over the rainbow lies Judy Garland. An innocent, fragile and talented young actress who infiltrated silver screens and rapidly shot to fame. The voice of an ethereal angel. MGM's golden girl.But behind the lavish productions and beneath that unimpeachable smile, was an undisputed amount of pressure. A malleable marionette susceptible to the puppetry of Hollywood. A product of ruthless executives. Garland was no longer a person. Her individuality brutally reaped by higher authorities, manipulating her into believing she was physically unattractive. Starving, pill-popping and overworked. That was the cruel life of Judy Garland. The glistening glitter and the iconic voice, mere facades masquerading the suppressed pain. Unfortunately though, her repressed childhood and early stardom steered Garland into a life of alcohol and substance abuse. The yellow brick road wasn't so golden after all.Goold's biopic (and part adaptation of the Broadway play) dramatises her later career, forced to perform a sell-out tour in London due to her unreliability in the States. Her unworkable state being a consequence of substance abuse. Clumsily walking out into the spotlight that she undoubtedly adored. That inevitable lust for fame. A legendary status. Trapped, her battle for the custody of her children raged on. Torn between the natural instinct of motherhood, and the only element of her life she's ever known. Her profession. Edge's screenplay, whilst surface level on certain aspects which merely imitated a biographical article instead of further sentimentalising Judy as an individual, eloquently explored the dangers of fame at such a vulnerable age. The inability to have a voice. To be bossed around by studio executives who see her as an asset rather than a human being.It's very much a by-the-numbers biopic, and Goold's blend of light and darkness within his direction made this comparable to the equally melancholic 'My Week With Marilyn'. Snippets of fans announcing their adoration for their idol, empowering the eponymous star even further. That joyous search for justification. But the sorrow never fades. Goold's constant tone of desolation throughout, whilst teetered on unnecessary melodrama, honed in on the impact Garland made. There's nothing more tragic than witnessing an individual undergo self-destruction, and Goold rarely distracts us from this.It all comes down to the central performance. The actress who is in every scene, devoting her soul into the character. Ladies and gentlemen, Zellweger became Garland. Astonishingly embodying her right from the immediate title card. I'll be irrefutably disappointed if she does not garner awards for her performance. Not only is it a career best, it's quite simply the best of the year. The nuances, the voice, the erratic body movement. Rarely does a performance make me lose sight of who is actually acting. During that final rendition of ""Over The Rainbow"", my eyes moistened. No longer was I seeing Zellweger, but Judy herself. It was cathartic. It was reincarnation. It was divine. Goold bravely shot the performances as one take sequences for the most part, which has to be applauded for artistic integrity. It did however make the lip syncing incredibly obvious which frustratingly pulled me out of the film. No fault of Zellweger's stunning performance though. Rising star herself Buckley deserves some praise for her crystal clear performance. Such delicate clarity against the chaotic Garland. Would've liked to have seen more from Gambon and Sewell, but appreciate the film is solely focussed on Zellweger.The film wouldn't work without her. Garland has never been depicted with such compassion before, and its an amalgamation of quality over quantity. It's not big. It's not flashy. It's just honest. Garland herself would've been proud, and we will never forget her. But please, do bring a box of tissues with you...",Judy
44,matthewssilverhammer,A Phenomenal Performance in a Rote Film,3,4 February 2020,"Judy lacks the emotional punch of a Wikipedia article, and it barely has more artistic merit either. Yes, Zellweger is quite good; she never succumbs to a strict imitation, and instead captures her deep troublesomeness, something much more interesting than a mimicked voice and mannerism. Otherwise, it's an obnoxiously predictable and downright boring downer that once again reminds us that (SPOILER!) show business is brutal.",Judy

48,paul-allaer,Outstanding Renee Zellweger sure to get Best Actress Oscar nomination,7,28 September 2019,"""Judy"" (2019 release; 118 min.) is a bio-pic about Judy Garland. As the movie opens, we are on the set of ""The Wizard of Oz"", and Judy is getting lectured by creepy ol' studio boss Louis Meyer. We then go to the present (i.e. the late 60s), where Judy can't afford her Hollywood hotel suite and is in essence homeless. Out of sheer desperation, she and her 2 kids end up at Syd, one of her ex-husbands (yes, she has multiple). When a lucrative offer arrives for a series of shows in London, she reluctantly accepts, as her kids are left with her ex... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is a multi-country co-production, and directed by British director Robert Goold, best known for his stage work in London, but he did direct the excellent film ""True Story"" a few years ago. Here he and the production team are bringing a Hollywood legend's waning years and youth to the big screen, so in certainly isn't covering Garland's entire life. Only 2 eras are covered: when she was 15-16, and her London 'comeback' in early 69. In that sense this is not a traditional bio-pic. Is everything that we see on the big screen an accurate reflection of July's life? I haven't the faintest idea. Most of the film plays out in London, and what we see is a frail woman who is world famous yet ever so lonely. She doesn't know who to trust as people left and right are riding Judy's coattails. And what about her youth at MGM? Even then she was manipulated, intimidated, abused, and taken advantage of (the scenes with Louis Mayer are revealing. Of course, we are watching a movie, with full of performances, and hence it needs to be pointed that Renee Zellweger is absolutely astonishing (and almost not recognizable) in the title role. She IS Judy Garland. Now age 50 (and hence perfectly well place to play the then-47 year old Garland), Zellweger brings a career-defining performance, period. On top of that, she does all of her own singing, and does it quite well. I am gong on record that Zellweger will get a Best Actress Oscar nomination for this, I have no doubt about it.""Judy"" premiered at the recent Telluride film festival to immediate acclaim, and the film opened this weekend on not one but two screens of my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am happy to report. In some of the more moving scenes of the movie, you could hear a pin drop in the theater. If you have any interest in Judy Garland, or are simply a fan of Renee Zellweger, I would readily recommend that you check this out, be it in the theater, or VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Judy
49,subxerogravity,High for Rene Zellweger low for Judy Garland.,7,2 October 2019,"I'm sadden by the fact that the only parts of Judy Garland's life They felt were worth telling was how hard is was for her as a shining bright child movie star and the era when that shining light was fading.
It's that type of movie that the Oscars looks for. Zellweger gives an amazing performance that's charming and in depth. You'll love her on the screen as Judy.
The movie itself is not all. A very mundane look at the tail end of Miss Garland's life with small flashbacks of her rough childhood on the silver screen.
Reminds me of the Iron Lady. Meryl Streep easily nailed her forth Oscar on a movie that was crap. Looks like Zellweger might do the same.",Judy
50,Turfseer,Narrow focus on Garland's last year emphasizing the negative fails to highlight her greatness as an iconic entertainer,5,5 October 2019,"There was a two hour TV series in 2001, Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows, based on Garland's daughter Lorna Luft's recollections, principally starring Judy Davis in the title role. The current film starring Renée Zewellger, did not have the approval of any of Garland's children (including Liza Minnelli) and is based on the stage play, End of the Rainbow, by Peter Quilter.
In director Rupert Goold's current effort, the story only focuses on Garland's last year when she was forced to take on work in London after realizing she was broke and having to send her children back to live with her ex-husband, Sid Luft, in Los Angeles.
On the positive side, Garland's love for her children is not glossed over and there is also a fine fictional scene where Garland meets two of her gay fans after a concert and goes back home with them where they cook a meal for her. The scene is I guess a tribute to her as a gay icon, as she always championed the underdog and those who were considered ""outsiders."" Indeed Garland's own ""outsider"" status is emphasized in flashback scenes when she fell victim to the movie studio system while making The Wizard of Oz, as a teenager in 1939.
As the young Judy, Darci Shaw unfortunately is miscast as she fails to convey the Garland mystique, even at her very young age. What the flashbacks do show is how Louis B. Mayer and his minions exploited and abused Garland and basically turned her into a drug addict of prescription pills (which eventually led to her death due to an accidental overdose). The flashbacks (like the rest of the film), only focus on the down side of Garland's career and one wonders while watching these scenes, weren't there ANY enjoyable moments while she was growing up?
Despite, Zellweger's reasonable impression of Garland, there is no insight offered here into why Garland had such an iconic status in the world of entertainment. Thousands of people came out for her funeral but you would never know it by watching this film. Instead all the imperfections are highlighted: the addiction to drugs, passing out during concerts, forgetting her lines, showing up late or refusing to go on, her failed last marriage to the dubious bartender Mickey Deans, as well as generally being highly arrogant and narcissistic with all those trying to make her stay in London a big success (one such ugly scene has Garland meeting the band leader and informing him that she doesn't intend to rehearse before the first performance).
In Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows, the complexity of her life is explored in much more detail, particularly her relationship with husband Sid Luft, who gets short shrift here in the current version. Instead of the pathetic character we see here, it probably would have been better to view Garland as she viewed herself: a survivor. Zellweger shows Garland's hard knocks as principally self-inflicted-a glass as half-empty approach. The glass half-full would have been much better. What's more, Garland was far wittier than depicted here-hence, the film's dialogue needed an upgrade in that department.
The other big mistake was not to use Garland's voice as part of the soundtrack. Instead, Zellweger takes a stab at doing all the vocals herself and of course fails considerably in comparison. A bright note is Jessie Buckley as Rosalyn Wilder who plays the handler attempting to ensure Garland gets through her performances at The Talk of the Town nightclub in London.
You can go and see Judy (the film) but mainly for purposes of comparison. I would check out Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows which can be found for free on Youtube, a far superior dramatic representation then what we have here.",Judy
51,jamesrupert2014,Interesting postage-stamp biopic,7,23 February 2021,"This focused biography of the legendary chanteuse Judy Garland (Renée Zellweger) follows the self-destructive singer as she performs in the Talk of the Town nightclub in London in 1968. Other than some flashbacks to her troubled life as a child star, notably interacting with Louis B. Meyer on the set of 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939), few other events in her complicated life are portrayed. Zellweger, (who did her own singing and was awarded an Oscar for her performance) is quite good as the 47 year old singer and the rest of the cast is fine. The cinematography is also quite good and film nicely captures the look and feel of the 1960s (especially the sometimes brutally ugly fashions). As in most biopics, liberties are taken with the truth, sometimes for dramatic effects, sometimes to accommodate 'modern' sensibilities. I liked the two gay fan characters (who are fictional) but the scenes with Garland ending up at their flat or their leading the audience in 'Over the Rainbow' when Garland breaks down on stage seemed contrived and inauthentic (the latter scene is based on a single women soprano finishing the song's final high-note that Garland couldn't sustain). I enjoyed the film but agree with critics who feel that 'Judy' is more about Zellweger doing a Judy impression (albeit an excellent one) than a biography.",Judy
52,stevendbeard,Last Days of Judy Garland,7,3 October 2019,"I saw ""Judy"", starring Renee Zellweger-the Bridget Jones movies, Cinderella Man; Rufus Sewell-The Man in the High Castle_tv, A Knight's Tale; Finn Wittrock-American Horror Story_tv, La La Land and Darci Shaw-this is her first movie but she was in an English tv show called The Bay.
This movie is based on a stage play called 'End of the Rainbow' by Peter Quilter. It covers the last days of the life of Judy Garland. Renee/Judy gets a concert gig in London in the winter of 1968-the real Judy died about 4 months after these concerts, in 1969. Renee hesitated about taking the job because she would be away from her children in America, who would be living with her ex-husband Rufus/Sidney Luft. Her career wasn't doing great at the time-she was almost broke-so she figured if she made enough money, then she could come back home and get full custody of her kids. The London concerts were all sold out in advance. Darci plays Judy as a teenager in flashbacks and Finn/Mickey Deans is another one of Renee's husbands-she married him in London. During the flashbacks, you learn about the causes of a lot of Judy's drug & alcohol problems. There is also a side story involving her popularity with the gay community. Renee does her own singing in the film, which she does a good job of. I even read that she is coming out with an album of her singing Judy Garland songs.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for drug use, smoking and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.
If you are a Judy Garland fan, you will probably like it more than I did-I'm not a big fan-so I wouldn't buy it on DVD. It would be a good rental.",Judy

But the final film is quite flat dramatically. You see you never truly see Garland in a happy and/or innocent state; you only ever see her being pushed around by the Hollywood powers that be. The flashback structure really re-enforces that Garland's life in entertainment didn't vary and she was always being abused. That may be accurate but the resulting film doesn't capture the emotion because there is no contrast. This is a story of innocents lost but we never get to see that innocence.Nonetheless, the film has some nice sequences-the super fan gay couple is especially engaging part of the film and they almost stick the landing because of it. Enough cannot be said about how good Zellweger is in the film. She gives a transformative performance.

It is written such that whilst Garland may have been in large part responsible for her destruction, she was not alone, exploited by many from her youth up until her untimely death.

At an arranged ""date"" at a diner with Mickey Rooney she isn't allowed to eat the hamburger, It's just a photo opportunity; a fake early 16th birthday party is staged by the studio but no cake for Judy.There are ups in this film as well as downs, some great song performances in London when she didn't turn up drunk and abuse the audience.

Sprinkled liberally throughout the film we see flashbacks of when Judy was under Louis B. Mayer's tyrannical thumb who kept her pilled up w/diet supplements & the like while she worked outrageous hours & the studio kept tabs on every aspect of her fledgling career. Zellweger captures the look & feel of Garland & does sing when required (even though she doesn't reach Garland like notes she imbues the performances w/an aura of Garland rather than an exact representation). Her love life is shown to be a shambles when she meets & later weds her fourth younger husband (Finn Wittrock) hoping for some financial stability (he claims he's a great idea man but the truth is he becomes more of the same kind of disappointment she's endured for most of her romantic life). The few bright spots comes from her befriending of a gay couple (who seem to make it to most of her performances) which allows Zellweger to let down her guard & be a normal person probably for the first time in a long while.

Zellweger delivers an exceptional performance as the titular character and really makes you feel everything she's experiencing.Downside here is everything else. Aside from the main performance, nothing really sings (pun intended) or stands out. It's just a standard biopic with a singular performance to elevate it a little higher.

It's just a shame that I realised this, because I could not see past Renee Zellweger and find Judy. I kind of felt that the film could have been a sequel to Chicago and portraying Roxie Hart's last days, as I'm convinced that her career would have surely ended the same way.Overall though the film was very good. I did like it. However I did feel like I'd been through it all with her, which I suppose is a good thing from a film makers perspective, but for me it's emotionally exhausting. I find this a lot with films these days, as they concentrate on the negative aspects of a biopic, rather than the fun and lighter sides. I know these things happen and that they are all part of the individual in questions life, but imagine that this was your first introduction to her, would you want to see more of her?Judy performed in a wonderful selection of films and on various TV shows, but the film makers chose to focus on the troubled last year of her life, much as they did with 'Stan & Ollie' (2018), another biopic that didn't fill me with the joy I'd hoped for.I wanted to see snippets of her time in 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) and 'A Star Is Born' (1954) and to see the rollercoaster of her life as she went through all five husbands and had her three kids. So while this is a good film and I enjoyed getting to know Judy a bit better, I don't feel that it showed the best of her. It's a good job that I already adored her wonderful talent.The supporting cast all do their jobs well and apart from the fact that Bridget Jones occasionally appeared on screen smoking a fag, Renee did well too. I would just like to see a bit more light with the dark as they managed to achieve with 'Rocketman' (2019).",Judy
64,mrdonleone,Double Feelings here,8,9 January 2020,Judy is a kind of movie that is nice to see but terrible to listen toher singing you get a terrible headache because she doesn't sing well of course it is a bold move to do the singing by herself he has in sha Allah but it's a bad idea to get it all together in the final product and then of course you start to wear your why am I watching this movie and if you want to watch a movie to watch it for the sentimental value of the old movie industry and definitely that's the way it is it's for the rest movie annoys more than Prince and the descent,Judy
65,Kingslaay,Renee shines in this film,7,15 February 2020,Judy is quite a decent film. It shows the tragic last period of Judy Garland's life and gives us sad snippets into her life as a starlet. Renee carries this film all the way to the end. An absolute standout and worthy of her Best Actress Oscar win. She becomes and is Judy Garland from start to finish. This is a sad and tragic tale of a beloved icon who went away too soon. It also portrays Hollywood in a bad light. Despite the sad tale this is a fitting homage and tribute to Judy.,Judy
66,LeonardKniffel,Company loves misery,3,11 October 2019,"Hindsight is 20/20 or so the aphorism goes. In the case of Judy Garland, however, hindsight is more like 20/90: 90 percent focused on the abused, drug-addled victim of Hollywood greed and 10 percent on the delightful human being who began her entertainment career as Frances Gumm, age 2. In the new biopic ""Judy,"" Renee Zellweger delivers a fascinating impersonation of a near- anorexic end-of-life Garland, but there is so much more to Judy Garland than what this movie would have us believe.Among the most touching moments in the film is the fabricated dinner with two gay fans who stick with her to the end, but mostly this movie left me dry-eyed. The problem with this and every other Judy Garland biopic is that it portrays her as a pathetic victim rather than a heroic rebel who suffered greatly because she had no capable protectors. No doubt she was a handful, but the men in her life served only to show what double-handfuls they were by comparison.Judy Davis's portrayal of Garland in the TV miniseries ""Me and My Shadows"" made her out as marginally less pathetic, especially in the scene where President John F. Kennedy asks her to sing ""Over the Rainbow"" to him over the telephone. She inspired so many, her talent was enormous, and to reduce it to the final lost years of her life does her no justice.I saw ""The End of the Rainbow,"" the play upon which this movie is based, about a decade ago in London and almost walked out because it was so miserable. Like the play, this movie is enough to make you regret that you ever enjoyed ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" because it makes you believe that Judy Garland made her way through those performances drugged and abused, as if she never had a good day in her life.Anyone who has observed Garland's story through the years knows that there were two times when she was truly happy--one was with her children, the other was delivering a song as if she were giving birth to it.At one point in ""Judy"" the nasty studio chief Louis B. Mayer presses Garland to choose between a career of Hollywood fame and glamour and a life as a dreary Midwestern farm wife. Somehow it makes us believe that she would have been better off cast in ""The Wizard of Oz"" as Auntie Em rather than Dorothy. Less obviously, it points out that she would have been the same woman with the same voice minus the studio bullying, the scrutiny of tabloid so-called journalists, and the sadistic voyeurs and users who somehow enjoyed her misery and felt that she had brought it upon herself.Misery loves company, so if you want to sit in a theater for two hours and watch a reenactment of the last horrific months of Judy Garland's life, by all means squirm through ""Judy."" Otherwise, for a much more interesting and nuanced appreciation of Garland's contribution to 20th century popular music, watch the blogger Isabel's ""Be Kind Rewind"" tribute, ""The 'Judy' Companion."" She observes that this film makes a spectacle of suffering. That is the real tragedy of Judy Garland's life: the spectacle that has been made of it.",Judy

Thank you, Matthew Luke Brady @bradym03>""You won't forget me will you?...Promise you won't""> 'Judy' isn't anything special as a movie, but at least offers a respectful perspective on the final years of Judy Garland's life.> Renée Zellweger, on the other hand, was the glue that hold this together. Her embodiment of Garland is truly remarkable. I didn't see Renee. I see nothing but Judy. Everything from her long eyelashes, crooked smile, and the brutal aftermath of Hollywood.This film is terribly sad, sometimes brutally so, so, expect a cathartic response. Renée Zellweger is superb. Even though she sings Judy's songs, we never fail to see Judy. Truly worthy her Golden Globe nod, maybe there will even be Oscar attention (as I write this, the nominations and awards are just gearing up). As for the rest, Matthew Luke Brady has already said it beautifully. All I can add is my rating and I give the film a 7 (good) out of 10, although I think Renée deserves a 10 (outstanding). {BioPic}",Judy
68,Foutainoflife,Pleasantly Surprised Yet Still A Bit Disappointed,8,13 January 2020,"Let's just get this out of the way...I'm not a Renée Zellweger fan. Don'task me why. There are just some actors/actresses that you just don't feel and she is one of mine. I don't hate her but I don't feel her. However, who doesn't love Judy Garland?In my opinion, Judy Garland's biggest success was her portrayal of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. She was absolutely perfect for the roll. She was sweet, vulnerable, head strong, compassionate and just a straight up American sweetheart who captured hearts around the world. Her character is timeless.Her life was not easy, for sure. I loved that this film did flashback scenes to help in capturing her journey and evolution as it helped in setting the tone for who she was at this point in time. What I felt was missing was the ending of her story.I just felt like we were left hanging a bit. There was so much more I would've like to have known about her final days and seeing as she was so young and we witnessed all the flashbacks, I had hoped that it was going to come full circle.Even though I don't care for Renée Zellweger, I am willing to give her props for this performance. It may be her best work ever. I could see Judy Garland in her portrayal and while there are things about it I could complain about, the overall effort is a success she should be proud of.I would recommend this if you are looking for a good biopic. It didn't come full circle for me but it was still a great watch.",Judy
69,Abdulxoxo,Good lead performance,7,24 June 2021,"Judy is a good biographic movie; but of course just like most if not any mainstream biopic, it sticks closely to the typical tropes of a biopic - particularly biopics about musicians - but is still an enjoyable film. The one aspect of Judy is how amazing Zellweger's performance is. Although I don't know much on Judy Garland, I think Rene Zellweger appeared to fully embody the character, displaying incredible dramatic prowess as well as a fantastically measured singing voice. The way she held herself both on and offstage told us everything we needed to know about how she was feeling without any need for words. A few criticisms I had is related to supporting characters. Most of the supporting cast were underutilised. Finn Wittrock plays Mickey Dean's, Judy's newest love interest; and he does get a decent amount of screen time, more could have been done with his character. More disappointing however was the extremely limited use of Jessie Buckley, she should have gotten more to do than basically collect Judy from her dressing room when it was time to go onstage. Overall, Judy is a traditional biopic with a magnificent lead performance.",Judy
70,martimusross,Disappointing Biopic That Misses The Mark,4,1 October 2019,"JudyVery much in the trend of recent biopics including Oliver Hardy, Freddie Mercury, Elton John and now Judy Garland. No more please!I remember Bette Davis saying to Michael Parkinson years ago ""no one is going to make my biopic as my life has been work, work and more work"", and thus it clearly was with Judy Garland.We had two hours focusing on the last few months of her life where she was a shadow of her former glory that portrayed her as a drunk, pill-popping wreck.There really was little story here to sustain a movie, whether Renee Zellweger was or was not like Judy she just had to little to work with except a drunken caricature of a broken woman.Renee Zellweger undoubtedly produced some moments that were persuasive and affecting but much was so on the surface we didn't warm and love her portrayal of this vulnerable and above all human person. Much seemed robotic.In terms of the music this was the biggest disappointment of all. Universally flat and uninspiring of one of the most memorable recording stars of the 20th century. Had this element been better it may have redeemed the movie.Overall I was bored by looking at a drunk woman for two hours, we all know about Judy, tell us something we don't know. Lastly apart from her tragic end Judy, I think, had a rather fabulous life with a lot of joy and fun, so this film left a nasty taste in the mouth.",Judy
71,btreakle,Judy Garland,10,28 June 2020,"This a was a well done movie about the world's best female singer ever in my view

72,jromanbaker,Not impressed,6,14 February 2020,"I am giving this film a 6 solely because of Zellweger's impersonation of Judy Garland. She did her best and on her own level she succeeded. But viewers should track down Garland's last film ' I Could Go On Singing ' to see how impossible it is to even attempt impersonating her. In fact this film I think draws very largely upon that earlier film. Especially the finale, and the plotline of fighting for her children. In the Garland film it was one child, in this two. Apart from Zellweger I found the film lack lustre and that dreadful thing painting by numbers. A central scene involving two Gay men was a token nod to the Judy for Homosexuals Syndrome and of course it had to mirror her and was pathetic and sad. The finale brought the same men back literally emotionally pulling the rest of the audience to their feet to give her recognition. I think even Russia will not cut them out as the representation of homosexuality was so much aligned to her own ' suffering ' life. The song ' Somewhere over the Rainbow ' seemed tainted by this and of course the cinemas will be awash with saddened tears. I also thought the direction was mediocre and apart from Zellweger equally mediocre performances. I was not impressed by the film as cinema and certainly not impressed by the pathetic representation of homosexuality. This was the late Sixties, not the early Fifties on that issue, but then despite the fact that homosexuals were beginning to feel positive about themselves Hollywood chooses ' the pain that cannot speak its name ' for its conservative mainstream audiences. This pathetic trope will allow it to be shown in countries that persecute homosexuality and also show how her own life is associated and allied with Gay men despite her own very different problems. I was not impressed by this film or its necessity for being made",Judy
73,NijazBaBs,negative and pointless,4,2 January 2021,"Although this is not the worst movie, I think it still is far from deserving oscar. First, it looks more like some song or practicing singing and acting skills, and except that, only drama happening in form of talk. Not for a movie, except maybe documentary. Second, not worth mentioning some old woman, in which I doubt at least any of us younger people are interested. I would prefer movie about somebody much more famous and younger. Third, I do not like her songs. 4th, it is trying to show something that is so simple, that is bad health and failure to control financial and family issues, in so complicated way. Also negativity dominates in form of ignorance for family, and career, and health, and forced actions. This just shows us how life is difficult when we do what we don't like or what we are forced by somebody else. And worst of all, too long time of such bad and boring movie.",Judy
74,proud_luddite,Mostly good with an amazing finale,7,30 May 2020,"Based on the play ""End of the Rainbow"" by Peter Quilter: the last year in the life of Judy Garland (portrayed by Renée Zellweger) is chronicled with special attention on Garland's struggles to perform in a series concerts in London while dealing with declining health.While it is next to impossible to tell the story of such an icon in two hours, the film thankfully includes flashbacks of Garland's early years as a teenage performer being horribly abused and manipulated with drugs in order to make her work according to unreasonable schedules. This part of history is important as it shows that her notorious addictions were forced on her by a despicable movie studio head, Louis B. Mayer. Despite her massive contributions to MGM, Judy was denied the basics of life such as food (drugs were a substitute), fun, rest, and free time. While these scenes were important, the film might have benefited more by having all these scenes at the beginning before jumping in time to the main story. The frequent shifts between timelines were sometimes jarring.While ""Judy"" is a good film, it doesn't fully live up to the greatness of its subject although it does focus well on the condition of loneliness. This is best exemplified in a scene when Garland shares a special bond with two special fans waiting at the stage door after one of her concerts.Zellweger's performance is a perfect impersonation of the legend with a lot of heart and depth. She truly shines in the final scene, a conclusion that is perfectly moving, stunning, and breathtaking. Once the film was over, it was difficult to leave the theatre; the impact was that strong. - dbamateurcritic",Judy
75,muamba_eats_toast,Beautifully heart aching,10,23 October 2019,I nearly didn't see this film thinking it wasn't my cup of tea but I'm so glad I did a perfect and beautiful portrayal of such a heartbreaking yet powerful true story of an extraordinary but troubled woman.

After all, Zellwegger neither looks, acts, nor sounds like Garland and Garland was distinctive in all those areas. Big Surprise. Zellwegger is so good she disappears and for nearly 2 hours I thought I was watching Judy Garland, My only criticism is the use of Zellwegger's voice, which is certainly strong, but when you have a film about a woman who had one of the greatest voices of all time, Zellwegger doesn't hold up. Would it have been so bad to use Garland's voice?",Judy

80,rockman182,Judy (2019),7,29 September 2019,"I love The Wizard of Oz, its actually one of my very favorite films of all time. It also happened to be a breakout role for star, Judy Garland. Its kind off a shame, how little I actually knew about her life. I knew she was troubled in her life but not to the extent I read about after watching this film. I felt that while the film was not perfect and does not always hit the mark, the performance by Renee Zellweger is sensational and very truly the best she has ever been in film.The film focuses on a portion of Judy Garland, near the end of her career and life. This is where Judy was performing for a few weeks at the Talk of the Town night club in London. At this stage of her career, she is plagued with a failing love life, drug and alcohol addiction, the emotional trauma that has been with her for the duration of her career, and bankruptcy. The film is a lens into how her life was at the time as her health was deteriorating.Zellweger was completely unrecognizable as Garland. She completely disappeared into the role and captures so much emotion, sarcastic humor, and personality of who she plays. Her performance in the film really keeps it afloat. Its not a bad film at all and was intriguing as a character study. I felt like there were parts of the film that could have been done better and parts that felt unrealized. Apart from that this will please in terms of the history of Garland and the musical numbers on display.Its sad to think about how Garland suffered and the detriment this caused for her career. The suffering through addiction and the pressures of the industry, all led to an early death. The film could have easily been a wide scope biopic of her life but I like how it framed itself on the latter portions of her life because it does a well enough job of showing her struggle and how she tries to overcome. It kind of reminded me of Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool. Its early but I already know Zellweger has an acting nomination in the bag.7/10",Judy
81,bankofmarquis,Brilliant performance by Zellwegger - and not much else,7,6 February 2020,"Renee Zellwegger is absolutely brilliant in her channeling of Judy Garland in the film JUDY. She deserves to - and WILL WIN - the Oscar for Best Actress. Her performance is amazing and I forgot that I was watching an actress playing Judy Garland and fell into a trance thinking I was actually watching the real Judy Garland.Too bad the rest of the film is not this good.Based on actual events, JUDY tells the story of a late in her career Judy Garland's trek to London for a series of Concerts. She is down on her luck, addicted to pills, filled with self doubt and ghosts from her past. In general...she is a wreck...and needs the $$ from these concerts to keep custody of her 2 young children.And...Zellwegger plays all of these emotions as Judy very, very well as well as shining in the performance scenes where Judy was able - albeit for a short time - to ""come up for air"" and perform as the world class performer she is. Zellwegger trained for over a year with a vocal coach to get the singing/performance part of this film down - and it shows. She is brilliant in these moments.The trouble with this film as written by Tom Edge (based on the stage play ""End of the Rainbow"" by Peter Quilter) and Director Rupert Goold is that this film doesn't really go anywhere. There is no arc to Judy's story. She starts the film as a trainwreck...and ends the film as a trainwreck. There isn't evem a realization by Judy that she is a trainwreck. She just IS a trainwreck.And that does not a compelling movie make.Rufus Sewell, Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock and Michael Gambon are all along for a ride on this train and all choose to get off before the end and the inevitable trainwreck that is going to happen.Is this film worth seeing? Sure...for Zellwegger's Oscar winning performance. Unfortunately, it doesn't have anything else to recommend it.Letter Grade B (solely on the performance)7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (OfMarquis)",Judy
82,Danusha_Goska,Heartbreaking Portrait of a Goddess in Decline,8,8 October 2019,"""Judy"" is a heartbreaking portrait of a goddess in decline. It depicts the final year in the life of film icon Judy Garland, during her performance at the London nightclub The Talk of the Town in 1969. And there isn't much more to say about this movie than that. It's heartbreaking. You see Judy fall on stage. You see concert-goers throw their bread at her in contempt. You see her, a woman who had been addicted to pills by MGM when she was just a teenager, struggling to sleep at night. You see her grabbing for booze, cigarettes, and pills just to get through the day.She marries Mickey Deans, a much younger, starstruck man she barely knows, whom the viewer decides is not good for her. She is unceremoniously kicked out of her residence, where she lives with her two children, Lorna and Joe Luft. She can't pay the bills. She's broke. She hands her kids over to ex-husband Sid Luft (Rufus Sewell). Sewell's scenes are brief but he communicates that he's been around the block, the hard way, with Judy, and he no longer views her through a gauzy lens. Luft informs Judy in brusque, no-nonsense words that he wants custody of the kids. They want and deserve stability and friends, not the peripatetic, hand-to-mouth show business life Judy offers them.All of this heartbreaking material would be easier to take, and would add up to a better movie, if there were a plot that allowed for Aristotelian pity, fear, and catharsis. Instead I'll remember this movie most for seeing Judy fallen on the stage, disgusted and betrayed fans throwing their bread at her.The problem is, of course, is that this is a true story, a story that most people who will attend this movie know all too well. We can't change the details of the plot, so the plot has no place to go but down.Judy Garland, born Frances Ethel Gumm, was one of the singular talents of the Golden Age of Hollywood. You can experience Judy's gift with a short visit to a YouTube video. Watch, for example, her televised rendition of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" She delivered this soul-stirring, powerhouse performance just after JFK was assassinated. That's more than a movie star. That's a supernova.Judy was born to a mother who didn't want her and looked into aborting her. Abortion was illegal and so Judy drew breath. Her father was gay and the family had to leave town after he faced morals charges. They moved to California. Her talent fell into the hands of Louis B. Mayer. Mayer, in photos, looks like a plump, elderly city councilman. If what we hear about his treatment of Judy is true, there is a special place in Hell for Louis B. Mayer.He was - allegedly - a drug peddler and greedy exploiter. Mayer recognized that Judy had talent, but he also recognized that she was not attractive. When Judy was just a child, Mayer starved her, plied her with drugs, and, allegedly, called Judy ""My little hunchback"" because she was short and had curvature of the spine. At the same time, this - alleged - greedy perv used to molest Judy. He would, repeatedly, put his hand on his child star's breast. Finally, when Judy grew up, she told him never to do it again. We see all this in ""Judy"" in flashbacks. You just want to jump up onto the screen and rescue that child.There are a couple of great scenes in ""Judy."" Late one night, she greets two gay fans at the stage door. They take her home for a meal. What happens in their apartment, and, again, close to the end of the movie, is very touching. I don't want to describe it here because I don't want to ruin it for you.Another provocative aspect of the film is its treatment of performance, and the life of a performer or any creative person. ""Judy"" shows Judy in performance mode, in mask-is-off mode, and in performance mode even though she's not onstage. All of this is handled very deftly. You realize what incredibly hard work performing is.I love Judy Garland. I see her as a martyr. I can't say that I've ever seen any other performer give so much, so consistently, in one performance after another, over the course of decades. Her rendition of ""The Man that Got Away"" in ""A Star is Born,"" that sums up impossible sexual yearning, her dreamy, wistful, melancholy, defiant, resigned, ever-hopeful ""Friendly Star"" from ""Summer Stock,"" her ""Get Happy"" from that same movie that feels like taking a bath in unadulterated sunshine, ""Mack the Black"" from ""The Pirate,"" a performance both sexy and witty - no one else has racked up that depth and breadth of material. Watching her suffer through this new movie made me cry.There's much talk about Renee Zellweger's performance. Zellweger is a fine actress and she gives a fine performance. The thing is, we already have Judy onscreen. Maybe what we need is a documentary. A question I'd really like to see answered is, by physicians, psychiatrists, accountants, Hollywood historians, did it really have to end the way it did?",Judy
83,allanmichael30,Drivel,1,25 September 2020,A really bad example of a biopic and hardly a true account of the life of Judy and just a really mess of a movie.,Judy
84,bob-the-movie-man,Decline and Fall,7,12 October 2019,"This is an extremely sombre film! Young Judy Garland is a starlet in the MGM studio system run by Louis B. Mayer (a villainous Richard Cordery). She doesn't have a life outside of the movies; is fed diet pills and ""pep-pills"" that destroy her sleep; and she is starting to get fed up with it all. No wonder then that she grows up to be an alcoholic insomniac with a trail of failed marriages and a temperamental nature.Thus, through flash-backs to the young Judy (the English Darci Shaw, in her movie debut) we track the older Judy (Renée Zellweger) through the last tragic years of her life. Unable to work, due to a reputation that proceeds her, she is forced to take up the offer from Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon) of a residency at London's ""Talk of the Town"". This separates her from her older daughter (Liza Minnelli played by Gemma-Leah Devereux) and, crucially, her younger children Lorna (Bella Ramsey) and Joey (Lewin Lloyd). (Their Dad is Sidney Luft (""Victoria's"" Rufus Sewell): hence Lorna being Lorna Luft). This separation increases Judy's mental decline.Also in a constant state of stress is Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley) who has the unenviable job of trying to keep Garland on the straight and narrow to perform every night.Whatever I think about the film overall (and we'll come to that), this is 100% the ""Renée Zellweger show"". It's an extraordinary performance, and is pitch perfect, both in terms of capturing Garland's mannerisms and vocal style. If Zellweger doesn't get an Oscar nomination for this then I'll eat my favourite orange baseball hat! I'll have to review the final short-list, but I would not be remotely surprised if she won for this.Elsewhere is the cast, Michael Gambon gives a reliable performance as Delfont (his second depiction this year after the turn by Rufus Jones in ""Stan and Ollie""!) and the rising star that is Jessie Buckley is also effective as Wilder in a much quieter role than we're used to seeing her in.Is this a musical? Or a biopic? Or neither? Actually, I would suggest it's neither. There's been a curious split in the last year between films like ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which were biopics with music, to ""Rocketman"" which was very much a musical based around a biopic.""Judy"" can't be classed as a musical since (and I checked my watch) the first musical number doesn't come until FORTY MINUTES into the picture. Neither is it a true biopic, focusing only on a few short months of Garland's extensive career, the 'young Judy' scenes being nothing but short flashbacks to set the scene. This probably makes sense, else a true biopic of the wonder that was Judy Garland would have turned into a 4 hour plus epic!Above all, it's a depressing watch, like seeing a sick animal in distress. But I never felt the film got to the heart of the matter to really make me CARE enough. The nearest it gets is with a moving portion where Judy makes the evening (if not the lifetime) of some super-fans - Dan (Andy Nyman) and Stan (Daniel Cerqueira). She goes home with them for omelettes and a sing-song: a strong nod towards Garland's extensive following, even today, among the gay community. The finale, where the couple try to salvage an on-stage psychiatric session by Judy is touching but, for me, not tear-inducing.The screenplay is by Tom Edge, from the stage play by Peter Quilter. The director is relative movie-newcomer Rupert Goold.I liked this movie, but did I like it enough to rush and see it again? No, not really. Worth seeing though to appreciate the odds-on favourite (surely!) for the Best Actress Oscar of this year.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

The latter was as much of a downer as Judy was in highlighting the terrible years that followed each parties success.Zellweger is just incredible as Judy Garland. She plays her so well in fact, I'd say a good 95% of the time you actually forget which actress you are watching! Just brilliant.Unless you've been living under a rock or too young to know the dark and disgusting story of her poor life, you just know there is not going to be a happy ending with this one. While many if the audience members were crying in our screening, I had yet to find that moment as I felt the whole film just ran along on one level...Kind of like flatlining. Not the usual ups and downs most films would have. Saying that, her closing moment of Somewhere Over The Rainbow almost had me.Judy is well worth the watch though, if only for Zellweger's performance. Don't be expecting many laughs and don't make it the last thing you see before bed. It's dark, its disheartening and it's sad to see such disregard for a human life so talented and innocent as hers just destroyed without anyone stepping in to help her...Guess Hollywood hasn't changed that much.",Judy
88,tm-sheehan,Great performance but wrist slashingly depressing,6,17 October 2019,"Judy -My Review.My rating 6/10
First let me say Congratulations to Rene Zellweger on a superb performance and impression of Judy Garland in her last few months of life.
Odds on I wouldn't like the movie ""Judy as I disliked the play it's based on ""End of the Rainbow "" by Peter Quilter. when I saw it in 2006 starring Caroline O'Connor in Sydney .
I'm a huge Judy Garland fan and have adored her movies , television shows and CD's most of my life.
Someone said once ""Everyone has a great movie in them if you cut out the boring bits but this movie cuts out the glorious bits and is wrist slashingly depressing.Judy is based on some fact as far as her last year of addiction is concerned but I checked up on the inaccuracies or fantasy moments in this sad depressing movie.
I won't spoil it for people who will go and see it except to say the two sad elderly gay men stereotypes were patronising The characters Dan (The fan)and Stan (The fan) who Director Rupert Goold says he added to show how much Judy meant to the LGBTQ1 Community made me cringe .
We didn't need to be told this Rupert it's part of history and their role in the movie stretched melodrama and stereotyped the perceived loneliness of being queer and miserable beyond the boundaries.
They just added to the overall sadness .I kept thinking thank goodness Judy Garlands 3 children Liza , Lorna and Joey have openly boycotted this movie.
I personally was upset losing my father to alcoholism when he was only in his early 50's so maybe I'm over reacting but the movie bought back sad memories when over the years I have concentrated on our happy times together.
I found this movie a real downer and like last years Oscar Wilde's end of life story ""The Happy Prince "" I can admire Rupert Everett's performance but I disliked the fact that any one in the audience who didn't know about the magnificent body of work of Oscar Wilde or Judy Garland and believe me there is a generation of younger people who don't .
Those people would just be seeing the sad boring depressing part of these great lives and missing out on the great contribution they made to our culture.A much better biopic of Judy Garland is Lorna Luft's Television adaptation of her memoir ""Me and My Shadows""starring our own Judy Davis. in her Golden Globe winning performance as Judy Garland.Recently Lorna Luft said. When asked why she won't see Judy.You know, I'm really protective of my mom's legacy and my mother's legendary career,"" Luft, 66, told ""Good Morning Britain"" hosts Ben Shepherd and Susanna Reed on Thursday. ""And I feel that if you really want to know about my mom, go see her movies and go listen to her recordings and go watch her television shows.""Liza Minnelli also won't see Judy said-''There's nothing I can say to convince people that I had a happy childhood,'' she says, her whispery voice, so reminiscent of her mother's, suddenly tremulous and urgent. ''They don't want to believe that, and part of the reason for that is because Mama said, 'I don't want them to believe that I'm happy or else they won't cry when I sing ''Over the Rainbow.'' ' But she ensured my happiness as a kid. I know what happened to me, and I know that I'm fine - you know, working and going forward. And I'm sorry - I'm terribly sorry if I'm not unhappy. It's not my fault I'm happy and I have been for most of my life.",Judy

So I don't know what I was expecting but I learned nothing new. Zelleweger did good for what she had to work with. There was no story. Relationships don't feel genuine because there is no character build. I thought they would show more than 2 minutes of Liza at a party and if you don't listen you'd miss who she is. What was the relationship between her and Sid, Mickey. I thought Mickey was just a friend then all off a sudden they marry. Shock because there was basically no showing of a romantic involvement or anything. it was a decent film because of Zelleweger. The other actors were fine for what they had to work with as well. I didn't want to see it because I felt I might be disappointed. It's ok I'll just go watch Wizard of oz or one of her many great films.",Judy
91,Andres-Camara,A pity,6,26 January 2020,"The movie is fine, but it could be much better. Personally, I don't like the musical, but of course, it doesn't take full advantage of the movie. Above all, the end is very badly finished.The actors are amazing. Renee is great, in every way, as she has lost weight and everything on her face shows what this person has been through. But it is that the girl and the producer, are of cinema. With a sequence, the producer and the girl, you get goosebumps.The truth is that he manages to show you how his life was, that if it is well achieved.The beginning of the movie has one of the best character presentations I've seen in a long time. From a close-up showing you, with a movement of crane and actors, on your pitch, it shows you everything, for what has happened.I imagine that really the costumes, hairdressing and makeup will be based on reality, but, at least, I don't think it's great.The lighting is also very good. As it puts you in its time. It takes you from cabaret.I don't like director's work at all. It focuses too much in the foreground. Even in the final part, or it goes from first to general and you don't see anything that happens. He did not want to end with applause which is well thought out, but what he could have achieved, he has not known how to roll.I have not seen all the actresses, but this year the Oscar, I think it will be very difficult.",Judy
92,MrDHWong,"A respectful, sincere portrait of an iconic actress/singer during the twilight years of her career",8,29 December 2019,"Judy is a biographical drama film based on the life of Hollywood star Judy Garland. Starring Renée Zellweger in the title role, it is a respectful, sincere portrait of an iconic actress/singer during the twilight years of her career.In 1968, Judy Garland (Renée Zellweger), once one of the biggest child stars in all of Hollywood, is now in her late forties and struggling to find work to help look after her children and herself. Desperate, Judy seeks advice from one of her agents who tells her that she can perform concerts abroad in the UK, as her reputation in the US has waned considerably. Even though this will require her to leave her children back in America, Judy sets off for London and becomes wildly successful singing to sellout crowds.Thanks to the efforts of its main star, Judy stands out as one of the most entertaining biopics of the 2010s. The film depicts Garland as an unfortunate product of the Hollywood system of that era, being moulded into the image they want rather than how she wants, permanently damaging her mental well-being as a result. In the end, this affects just about everything and everyone she encounters in her life, and the sad truth is that she only wanted to live like a normal person, free from dieting drugs and bullying by her Hollywood agents.Structurally, the film is presented in two eras; firstly in modern day (1968) and during Garland's early teenage years, the latter of which is shown in flashback. This helps the audience to understand that the root of Garland's problems can be traced all the way back to her most important of ages, as even as a young girl she was forced to act a certain way at the threat of never finding work again. The flashback scenes are used quite well, although there were parts where they did disrupt the film's pacing during certain moments. At the same time though, I did feel that they were a necessity as some of them did end up syncing with the modern day scenes to put Garland's actions into perspective.Renée Zellweger gives one of the best performances of her career in the lead role. Not only does she go for physically resembling Garland but she also did all her own singing as well. This could be seen as something of a comeback for her, as there haven't really been any noteworthy roles in her filmography in recent years. I believe that this film will help put her back on the map and re-open some doors for better acting roles as a result.Overall, regardless of your opinion on Judy Garland, this is certainly a biopic worth checking out. Zellweger's acting and singing are the true highlight of this film and it is nice to see her back in the spotlight showcasing her talents as an actress. I remain hopeful that she will receive the recognition she deserves and recovers from the career slump she has been going through for so long, much like the very person she plays in the film itself.I rate it 7.5/10",Judy
93,Alexander_Blanchett,A positive surprise,8,11 December 2019,"I was positivly surprised about this biopic. It was really interesting, well developed and executed. The heart and soul is undoubtly Renée Zellweger who really thrilled me in this. I did not expect any actress would beat Scarlett Johansson in Marriage Story for me this year but Zellweger indeed did it. Its not only her best performance but generally one of the best portrayals of an iconic artist that we have seen in a long time by an actress. And Zellweger managed something special. She managed to not overact although the character Judy Garland offered so much potential to be portrayed overacted. Renée Zellweger perfectly held the balance between theatralics and seriousness. There were many scenes that really send you shivers down your spin.
Direction and screenplay were fine too, never losing focus on the character Judy Garland. It had a great and realistic look and feel with nice production design, really great costume work.
The score was very subtle and so was the direction. Really one of my biggest surprises this year.",Judy
94,catpantry,Anti magic,10,15 March 2020,The film is so good. Go see it. Plan it out. Nothing should stop it. If anyone says its bad run away. If you can't run then hire someone to burry you in heated pennys.,Judy
95,Beejerman,CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),9,9 January 2020,"The stage curtains open ...I didn't grow up with Judy Garland. In fact, I wasn't even quite a year old when she died. But I did grow up with ""The Wizard of Oz"". Back when I was just a kid, we still used to have reel-to-reel tape recorders. Every year, ""The Wizard of Oz"" was shown on one of the three major television networks. One year, my Mom got out the old Wollensak, and placed it right under the TV speaker and recorded it for me and my little brother to listen to - over and over and over again. It is the first film and music memory from my childhood.""Judy"", starring Renee Zellweger in an award winning performance, begins with a young Judy Garland on the set of the aforementioned classic film, being told that her only redeeming quality is her voice. What a far reaching effect that would have on her for the rest of her life. We flash forward to her final days when all her inner demons and struggles come to a head. She goes to London for a string of concerts, which would turn out to be her last. Sad and triumphant.This is a very touching and poignant movie. I felt that Renee Zellweger did a wonderful job. I was afraid going in, that her own personality and charisma would drown out that of the woman she was portraying. Not so at all. Zellweger was not a distraction from her character. She invests herself so completely into her role, that I forgot I was watching her. I was watching Judy Garland. The songs are strong and memorable. The story has it share of holes and inaccuracies, but I didn't care. And the ending will certainly touch your heart.I highly recommend this movie. I would watch it again and probably enjoy it even more the second time. Even though I never grew up with Judy Garland, she still had an impact on me as a very young boy. I can still hear her singing ""Over The Rainbow"" from my mother's recording on that old Wollensak. 9 very strong stars out of 10.",Judy
96,davidgee,Falling off the rainbow,9,3 October 2019,"A biopic of Judy Garland has been promised on and off for decades. Finally it's here. And worth the wait! Renée Zellweger is sensational, recapturing not just the look of Garland, but her walk, her gestures and that edginess she so often displayed as her addiction to pills sent her career into a tailspin.As biopics go, this is a good one. There are only a few moments when the performance teeters into parody. I'd like to have seen more of Liza Minnelli, who perhaps wasn't happy about the movie. When Judy is not belting out songs on stage, the film gets a bit mawkish, but I guess Judy's life was mawkish. There's a charming scene when she goes home with a couple of gay 'stage-door johnnies' and they try to cook her an omelette. The pair re-appear towards the end, demanding their money back at the box-office when Judy has been replaced by Lonnie Donnegan. Who wouldn't!",Judy
97,andrewroy-04316,"The best example yet in a long line of flat, manipulative, by-the-numbers musical biopics",4,29 January 2020,"My patience with musical biopics was already completely gone after the grating flaws of Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, but while Judy doesn't have the massive faults of the other two, it also doesn't have any major positives. It has the exact same eccentric, inconsistent artist we've seen at the center of all of these biopics starting around Walk The Line, and didn't show anything in her character or interactions to make her random swings meaningful. It manages to feel both flat, because we don't get many real traits of Judy so don't feel anything towards any character, and manipulative, as some scenes are individually emotional but after a few highs and lows it feels more like you're being tugged along without any meaning. By the ending I was bored and utterly detached from Judy, and given her arc it didn't even feel uplifting anyways. Most people have said that it's a fine, mediocre biopic (which I truly believe is giving it too much credit), but that Zellweger's performance makes it worth watching. I'll be the first to admit that I know little about Garland, so maybe I'm not in a position to judge her performance, but if I'm taking it just in the context of the film, I thought it was fine but not noteworthy or deserving of a nomination, let alone a win.I could talk more about why the unoriginal biopic flaws are so annoying, but I've beaten that to death between my reviews of Walk the Line and particularly Bohemian Rhapsody and Rocketman, so instead I'll focus on the only element I liked and think could've made it a good film. That element is the flashbacks to a 16 year old Judy Garland. They don't work here because the connection between the stress she felt at 16 to the struggles to perform in London is simply not there. However, the aggressive, burnout-inducing side of showbusiness and how it affects young rising stars is an interesting angle. A deeper psychological analysis of those effects, along with broader discussion of the fickle nature of public attention could be really interesting. Instead, it was a piece that didn't fit into this otherwise bland and lifeless biopic.",Judy
98,pilot1009,Not a Biopic,3,9 February 2020,Somewhat long winded and only poraying Judy on her declining year this movies lacks any charm or entertainment value. Depessing and not reflective of her real life cannot help wonder why it was made. Well acted without a doubt by all but what was it meant to portray? Pointless.,Judy
99,baileycrawly,"We'll Never Forget You, Judy. I Promise.",9,1 January 2020,"Where do I even start with talking about this movie?This is a movie that needed to be made. It's a breath of fresh air to see such a beautifully constructed homage to the life of Judy Garland coming out of the Hollywood machine. As someone who was overworked and had their lives flipped upside-down in all the worst ways by that same system, this is a humbling attempt to tell her side of the story. And they didn't choose to cop out by showing Judy's journey through the making of The Wizard of Oz (although that was also a very strenuous experience for Judy). They went right to the darkest point, mere months before her death of a barbiturate overdose in 1969.All the emotion is there exactly on cue. You can tell what the intention was behind each scene, and I really felt that the emotion shone through accurately.The casting of this movie is top-notch. Everyone did a fantastic job, but Renee Zellweger absolutely blew everyone else away with her portrayal of the vulnerable, scared Garland who, even in the later stages of her life, was still being carefully controlled behind the scenes. She did a fantastic job of portraying the insecurities and, ultimately, pain that Judy Garland would've been going through. All the Oscar buzz truly is accurate; if she doesn't win for her performance in this movie, I will be genuinely upset. Of the major biopics to come out recently (Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, Blinded By the Light and, perhaps, Yesterday), the acting in this movie beat them all out of the park. You aren't watching Renee play Judy Garland in a film; you're watching the spirit of Judy Garland shining through Renee's body.It wasn't an easy movie to watch. Not because it was bad by ANY means, but because of the nature of the plot and the subject matter. Seeing this woman, who had been working without ceasing since she was two years old, continually being abused, talked down to, and forced to work long past the point of total exhaustion was difficult. During the film, and even now that it's over, you just want to reach out to Judy, to help her, to give her a hug and try to get her out of that situation. She lived a tragic life, given a kind of immortality through the films she starred in but ultimately losing her soul to the Hollywood machine in the process.This was a beautiful tribute to Judy Garland. After all these years, people still talk about her. People still care. People still watch her films, listen to her interviews, read up about her experiences. If a film from 1939 is still being watched regularly in 2020, then success has been achieved. Her work in all of her films has stood the test of time and she will forever be cemented as a figure in pop culture history for as long as this world is spinning.We'll never forget you, Judy. I promise.",Judy
100,sweidman-28016,Emotionally Gripping,7,15 October 2019,"Judy Review:Just follows legendary performer Judy Garland as she arrives in London in the winter of 1968 to perform a series of sold-out concerts. I like Judy Garland so the thought of a film about her brought excitement. And with Renée Zellweger as the lead, who wasn't excited. We all knew she could perform and act after her performance in Chicago. Let me tell you, that woman can act. Give her an Oscar! She makes this film. She sounds like Judy Garland (both talking and singing), she looks like Judy Garland, she was Judy Garland. I loved her relationship with everyone in the cast. Her assistant in London, played by the amazing Jessie Buckley (who should also be nominated for an Oscar for Wild Rose), was my favorite relationship. They worked well together and I loved their scenes. Jessie Buckley was very good in this as well. She tries to put Judy's life together in the short time that she's there. I thought that the film put good insight of how she became the woman that she did when she grew up. The Wizard of Oz really screwed her over. They incorporate flashbacks back to her childhood and I think that was a great addition. Darci Shaw plays young Judy and I think she'll go places. I thought for the short amount of screen time she had, she was fantastic. The flashback scenes were cool to me since there was the whole set for The Wizard of Oz and I think the production design looked beautiful and there were cool cinematography choices, also with the present scenes. There's extravagant costume designs and fun musical numbers. My favorite scene in the whole film is at her last performance they show. It was so emotional and Zellweger says a line that just made me tear up. That's when I wanted her to really win the Oscar. It's a gripping story. I think there were some issues with storytelling. With switching between the past and present, some edits didn't make a whole lot of sense and felt random. It also had a side story with two men that was a little weird. It brought up some social issues which was good but wasn't really relevant to the story until later on. Other than those little things, I think this is a well done film. It shines mostly with acting. The story, though had some issues, is really emotionally gripping. The relationship she has with everyone, especially her kids, really helped. I would really recommend Judy.My Grade: A-",Judy
101,Dragonborn64,First Rate Acting,9,13 June 2021,"Oh boy, Renee Zellweger hits it out of the park. Might say best performance but she's given so many. This movie is all her, the rest seems irrelevant. She's really great.",Judy
102,CineMuseFilms,A tour-de-force portrait of a fallen star.,8,28 December 2019,"Calling the film Judy (2019) a bio-pic implies that the totality of Judy Garland's life can be defined by her sad final six months. Viewers hoping to see the bigger picture about this mid-twentieth century entertainment icon might feel cheated, but all will be rewarded with a dramatic tour-de-force portrait of a fallen star.We meet the young Judy (Darci Shaw) in a flashback to Wizard of Oz and the tyranny of working under the Hollywood studio system. Told by MGM executives that she was ugly and overweight triggered a life-long dependency on drugs and alcohol. We then meet the adult Judy (Renee Zellweger) at the nadir of her career, long after decades of success. By her late 40's, American audiences had tossed her aside like a soggy rag doll but the British were still dazzled by her Hollywood star power.A serial divorcee with two young children to feed, broke and a chronic substance abuser, she left for London hoping to revive her former fame and fortune. Instead, her performances became guessing games to see if she would make it onto stage. Eventually she imploded dramatically under the spotlight, crushed by demons beyond her control.In its two-hours, the only highs in this film are when Zellweger channels Garland through song. The rest is an over-wrought portrait of unrelenting despair. To compress past into present the film relies on multiple flashbacks, making the editing feel fractured and discontinuous (perhaps intended to reflect Garland's life). Despite Zellweger's stellar performance, there is little to like about Judy. Some viewers may be distracted by the visual difference between Garland and Zellweger and the exaggerated facial tics that the latter performs excessively. Yet the film's centre of gravity is always Zellweger, whose body language on stage is as dramatically sculptural as was Garland's.It's tempting to speculate why this film is made now. Garland's story has been told many times, and those who do not know about it generally don't care. In times of turbulence, this film is hardly a celebration of enduring American values. Knowing the 'true story' behind the Garland legend shatters illusions and empowers new generations to be wary of the Hollywood dream factory.",Judy
103,TaylorYee94,Understanding Judy Garland,8,12 February 2021,"The director brings back Garland whom modern generation just thinks of as Dorothy in another world and draws empathy and understanding of the character from the audience. Garland was desperate, fragile but hopeful. All those complex and mixed emotions are delivered to the audience thoroughly and wholly, and it is possible thanks to Zellweger's genuineness and complete transformation to Judy Garland. Her performance stirs up emotions calmly but very powerfully, and her singing and soundtrack are of high quality as well.",Judy
104,akcenat,Renée Zellweger as Judy Garland had the performance which is her career-best,8,15 December 2019,"After ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""Rocketman"" and ""Stan & Ollie"" now we have ""Judy"" about about star (Judy Garland) life in the UK. ""Judy"", too, might well be one of the saddest movies of the 2019 because there are no happy moments in this biopic, while Rene Zellweger's performance might just be the best of the year (she will probably win the Oscar). That being said, compering to first two mention movies, for this one if had it not been for its leading performance, it would likely have been included in the pile of middling biopics that seem to pop up every few years. However, with R. Zellweger the entire film is elevated to another level. When you're watching ""Judy"", you're not watching Zellweger but Garland. The performance is a career-best, no mstter she may not sing quite like Garland, but who really does? Culminating with a breathtaking final 10 minutes that expose the heart of Garland's deep vulnerability, it's easy to excuse some of ""Judy""'s more melodramatic moments along the way. To conclude, this film does not add anything new to the Garland myth, but it rehearses the star's woebegone existence with affection and aplomb. Also, ""Judy"" is only the second feature from director R. Goold, but it is certainly an assured outing, and at a running time of 118 minutes, it is exhilarating, tender and genuinely heartfelt biopic.Rating: 7+/8-",Judy

There is a bit of remoteness to this film though. A couple of marriages were skipped over, there wasn't a lot of depth to the dialog or story. The obvious was shown but without a lot of deep discussions. We see she is tired, anxious and nervous, that is obvious, it's right there in the performance. But something is missing.
The script itself could have been deeper to match the soul bearing performances.

If you are a fan of Judy Garland or a fan of these types of films, then I guess you'd enjoy Judy a lot more than I have.The entire movie was just Renee Zellweger singing, taking pills, and having a mid-life crisis. I could only go half way until I got really bored of the film. There's a lot of repetition going on, and I didn't really enjoy the music, so it's not like it was good repetition. If you like the genre of music that is being sang, then I'm 100% sure that you'd enjoy this film a lot more. And the plot was fairly boring to me; this isn't my type of drama.What does hold this film up was the acting and production quality. Judy was filmed very well, with decent cinematography and editing. The highlight of the film was Renee Zellweger's performance. It wasn't the best acting that I've seen from an actress, but her performance definitely deserved the Oscar.Judy is a very opinion based film; some may think it's a masterpiece, others may think it's average at best.

The film is directed by Rupert Goold, the director of True Story. Judy Garland was an actress who became known for her acting in films such as The Wizard of Oz from 1939 and A Star is Born from 1954. Judy Garland is played in the film by Renée Zellweger.In the film, Judy Garland had her best times in acting in America. For this reason she decides to travel to London where she is still loved and wanted by her fans. She knows how to keep her fans happy with theater shows and also earn money. In this way, she manages to provide financial support and care for her children left in America. Despite her success in London, Judy still uses a lot of alcohol and medicines. She was already given the medication as a kid by the people of the film world, so that she stayed in shape and would not lose her career because of an overweight appearance. The drink and medicine combination sometimes confuses her and is used by people who try to take advantage of her glory and talents. Judy has to manage her addiction to be able to make her own choices, so that she does not lose her income and care for her children.Several documentaries have already been made about Judy Garland, but in this documentary they focus the story much on her life after her American film career. The film does contain some flashback scenes that show how, as a young girl, she had to follow certain rules in order not to lose her acting career. In this way she was told that she was not allowed to eat the wrong food and that her career was only due to her voice and singing. In the documentary, for example, they clearly show how tough an actor's life was and are still today, because for certain roles, actors must adhere to rules such as maintaining a certain weight for a specific role.Renée Zellweger delivers beautiful and fitting acting as Judy Garland, who is at the end of her acting career. She manages to portray the role in her own way, but unfortunately does not come across as Judy Garland did with her acting and life. The film shows how Judy continued to work to get money, even though she sometimes didn't feel like it or had the energy. The film shows how difficult life can be for someone suffering from a burn-out. Since 2016 with the film Bridget Jones's Baby, Renée Zellweger has not done as good acting work in her acting career as she does in this film. It is also nice to see her sing and dance in a movie that she really did in 2009 in the movie New in Town. Although she hasn't sung or danced in films for ten years, she still knows how to convey this in this film. For her acting in this film, she will probably be nominated for various film prizes such as the Oscar for best actress.
The rest of the cast also does good acting as the people around Judy Garland who try to help, direct or use her. Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock and Michael Gambon also know how to perform their roles.",Judy
115,themadmovieman,A deeply touching and reflective look at the life of a spectacular but troubled talent,8,2 October 2019,"On the face of things a fascinating account of a spectacular but troubled life, Judy is a brilliant biopic right the way through, but what really makes it stand out is its electrifying emotional passion, both for the charismatic performer that was Judy Garland, as well as the deep inner turmoil she suffered for so many years, brought to life by an exhilarating lead performance from Renée Zellweger.If there's one thing to say about Judy as a film then, it's that it stays incredibly faithful to the spirit of its subject matter. At times a quiet and tender emotional drama, and at others a big, theatrical piece, the film shows off all the sides to the legendary actress and singer, and never holds back even when it comes to the darker moments.Now, there are times when the film isn't quite as spectacular as you might hope to see, and that Elton John biopic Rocketman proved could work so well, but I really appreciated the commitment here to making a quieter, more reflective film that, while not forgetting Judy Garland's incredible performing talents and often larger-than-life personality, allows you to really connect with her as a person in her most troubled time.If you're a fan of Garland's music, there's definitely enough to satisfy you, featuring a number of hugely entertaining performances of her most memorable songs, capped off with a deeply touching rendition of Over The Rainbow. However, what this film does so well is give you a riveting insight not only into the woman behind the music, but the world in which she lived for so long, and its deep impact on her entire life.Renée Zellweger's performance is absolutely fantastic. Not only does she brilliantly carry off the likeness, mannerisms and character of the singer, she gives a heart-wrenching turn as an emotionally drained Garland that, despite her strong, vibrant personality, is at her wits' end no matter what she does. And there, whether it's in the energetic musical sequences or the most intimate, quiet moments where we the camera focuses long and hard on her face, we learn so much about Garland's struggles and innermost thoughts without anything being said straight up.Saying that, I wouldn't call this the most subtle of biopics, but nor is it a melodramatic, 'Oscar-baity' film. It has the theatrics that go well with Garland's character, but it also stays away from loud, chaotic emotional drama that so often cheapens the power of a film, and it's those quietest moments where Judy is at its most powerful, and absolutely most touching.It is a bittersweet watch, and director Rupert Goold does well to blend the dramatic highs and lows of the story, also bringing Garland's experiences as a young woman when working on The Wizard Of Oz into play. Those flashbacks are occasionally a little clumsy, and don't quite match the deeply pensive tone of the scenes set in Garland's later years, but they also serve to give great context to the person we see in the late 1960s, and absolutely deserve to have a place in the film.Overall, then, I was really impressed by Judy. Not only an interesting and informative biopic, it's a film that's filled with so much touching emotion that it's difficult to not feel entirely encapsulated by its reflective look at a troubled life. At times, it's a vibrant, energetic theatrical piece, and at others it's as quiet and thoughtful as it can be, but with a powerhouse performance from Zellweger, some great music and a moving story, it's a fantastic watch throughout.",Judy

Even without knowing the true extent of the personal difficulties Garland had to face in her short life, this film manages to convey the singer's compulsion to perform. The people surrounding her, whilst often acknowledging her incredible skill, nevertheless seemed to have been hell-bent on undermining her. This film hints at the toxic environment Garland inhabited in order to ply her trade. The story is sad but Garland shines through. What a star!

This film is no different and leaves you feeling a little sad and unsure if I could watch the wizard of Oz the same way again.However it is well worth watching the film for Renee Zellwegers brilliant performance, she is just superb, and well supported by the rest of the cast as well.

120,wilvram,Real Star Quality,7,10 October 2019,"Renee Zellweger is utterly convincing as tragic star Judy Garland in a biopic following in the footsteps of STAN AND OLLIE, with the aging Hollywood performer lured to England by Bernie Delfont. Apart from Zellweger's stunning performance it is not particularly remarkable, offering no great insights into the people involved, and it is hardly a revelation that Hollywood moguls like Louis B. Meyer were exploitative and ruthless. That said, apart from a rather sticky opening segment, the film flew by and was good entertainment.

125,daoldiges,A Moment in the Life of Judy Garland,5,24 December 2020,"The film presents itself as a biopic of Judy Garland but really only covers a very brief period of her career and in that regard all of the drama that we're given seems kind of random and almost arbitrary. The timeline is so narrow and the story covered also very narrow that it's challenging for the viewer to become emotionally engaged. I am going to be the lone dissenting voice here when I say that while I do think Renee Zellweger does a fine job with her performance, I think it was just that, fine. I am familiar with the real Judy Garlands film and concert work and think this project is but a mere appetizer that makes me think there is a great, future Garland story and film that could still be to come.",Judy
126,CabbageCustard,Star turn from Renee Zellweger in a fairly dull film,6,17 February 2020,"If you don't know much about this film (and I didn't) other than it is the story of Judy Garland, then you should know movie that this only deals with Judy's last year or so before her sad death at just 47 years of age. There are a few flash backs to her early years in Hollywood, but just a few. These give you some insight into the abuse she suffered at the hands of greedy movie moguls and which contributed to the difficulties she faced as an adult.Zellweger does a good job playing Judy Garland - surely a very daunting task for any actress. She sings her own songs in this movie too. It is no insult to say that Renee Zellweger is no Judy Garland when it comes to singing, but she is still surprisingly good. The rest of the actors are great too. The only trouble with the movie in fact, is that it isn't particularly interesting. I realise that this is based on a play, but personally I would have much rather seen an old fashioned biopic that gave us Judy Garland's life story. That would have cut down the time available to focus on her final months to be sure, but it would have made for an more interesting and emotionally impacting movie. As it is, this is a movie I have trouble recommending. I'm glad I watched it, but I was quite glad when it was over.",Judy

136,isaacochoterena,Heartbreaking,7,13 September 2021,"Although this film does not have a defined plot, it manages to empathize with the protagonist.With an impressive performance by Renée Zellweger, they bring us a story full of pain and sadness. The film makes a criticism of the entertainment industry, about how artists are seen as simple products not as people and that they exploit each part of them in order to obtain profits, it also refers to the treatment of women in the business show, about how they have to be seen in order to be admired and to create stereotypes that continue in society today. As for the story, it tells us more about what the protagonist feels and how she deals with it, instead of telling a specific story, this may seem unattractive when watching the film, however, in this one the photography stands out, good production design and direction. If you like biographical stories, you will definitely connect with the film, but if you are looking for a more concrete story, I think this film will not be to your liking.",Judy

138,plasticanimalz,Very Good Movie - Great Performances,8,10 January 2020,"It's not like I'm a Garland aficionado, but what I do remember seeing of her, Renee Zellweger was spot on in her performance. I saw no Renee, all Judy. I heard she won the Golden Globe and it was well deserved. I can't imagine a better performance of the year than this. The story itself is interesting, as I knew very little of her personal life other than an actress with a brilliant career, who was beloved, and her life ended tragically. As does happen to many shining stars.It's all very well done but tragic. This is not about the ups of her life but of her downs. From the reviews I read that were unhappy with the film, they all seem to be fans who grew up with her and are upset that it didn't tell the breadth of her life and all the accomplishments. But it's very clear this film is about one segment of her life, at the end, so, maybe they should have looked into that first. It seems if you want to see her ups, go watch her old movies. Telling that side seems kind of like telling Karen Carpenter's upside. We all know what happened and it would be weird to ignore it. Watching this made me want to explore a docu-seires that explores that depth of Judy Garland's life, so, I think the film did a good job in what it was supposed to do, peak the interest of people, including those that weren't around until after her death, like myself.",Judy
139,MovieBuff11732,A Movie Worth Buying!,9,19 March 2020,"Judy is about the career of the famous singer and actor, Judy Garland.Judy was a movie I wasn't expecting to be as great at it was. I thought Renee Zellweger was going to give a good performance, which she did. I thought the movie was just going to be fine though. Once it was over I was blown away. I loved it. The end in particular was a great scene. It was heart warming and exciting. That being said, there were still some problems with the story. The middle was a little slow. That was the only time were I looked at the time a couple of times. There were also some flashbacks that were good in some scenes but then sometimes they just randomly popped up and were sometimes annoying. Like I said, they did help you get a better understanding on what she had to go through as a child. I never knew she had to do all of those things. It was actually kind of sad, but sometimes they would pop up in the middle of scene for no reason. Besides those small things, the movie was flawless! The feel of the film was something I wasn't expecting. The way the I thought the film would feel was classy. You really only got that when she was on the stage a few times. When she was off the stage it was sort of sad or happy. They mastered that perfectly. It is hard to have two different feels in a film. Renee Zellweger though gave an outstanding performance! She diffidently deserved the Oscar for this film. The other people in the film also did a great job. There were these two guys in the film in particular that were worth noting.Overall, Judy was a fun and exciting film I would recommend for anybody! Especially people who like Judy Garland!",Judy

142,Sasha_Lauren,"Riveting movie about Judy Garland, Renée Zellweger nails it",8,16 March 2020,"I got swept up in this movie. Renée Zellwegger is riveting as Judy - she even duplicates her posture. The supporting actors and script are solid, the film is beautifully shot and the costumes, wonderful, The story focuses on one of the last years in Judy's life during the five weeks she performed at London's Talk of the Town cabaret; flashbacks provide a balanced backstory without going overboard.I've heard from some people who thought the filmmakers ought to have dubbed in Judy's voice when Renée sings, some even call it Judy karaoke; I enjoyed Zellwegger's singing. It was her portrayal of Judy Garland, and the real-time authentic performances contributed to the mesmerizing mood and chameleon-like effect in my opinion.Liza Minnelli did not give her approval to this film. In remembering her mother, Liza offered this, ""We had such fun because she was so funny... she loved her kids so much. She was protective and very strict. She wanted you to do the right thing, like any mother. It's that simple.""Judy's younger daughter Lorna said, ""We all have tragedies in our lives, but that does not make us tragic. She was funny and she was warm and she was wonderfully gifted. She had great highs and great moments in her career. She also had great moments in her personal life. Yes, we lost her at forty-seven-years-old. That was tragic. But she was not a tragic figure.""",Judy
143,Oktay_Tuna,"Extraordinary Performance, Mediocre Movie",6,22 July 2020,"Yep, the title sums my view on this movie pretty much. Zellweger deserved the Oscar, because this was her movie. This movie would've been way different if it wasn't for Zellweger. The source material in Judy Garland's life is huge but the way they present this is sloppy. Scenes are sometimes rushed and sometimes really long. Side characters were mostly just side characters, they were underdeveloped and the storylines didn't really create an impact(sometimes Zellweger's acting alone made an impact, that's different). The rise and fall of Judy Garland are both really interesting stories and the film doesn't really use them to their full potential. This movie is Renee Zellweger, and that's a fact. If they were to write no script and tell Renee Zellweger to act as Judy Garland it would also work. The movie did its best to give Renee Zellweger an Oscar, other than that they just made a mediocre movie. But you should still check it out, because Zellweger becomes Judy in this movie.",Judy

We want to remember the star who could always seem to give a stellar performance, no matter how travailed a life (""Meet Me in St Louis"". We want to remember Judy in those so many iconic roles (""A Star is Born"") that showed her talent, even in her small performance in ""Judgement at Nuremburg.""We do not want to see her in those last cadaverous months before her death in June, 1969 at age 47 by ""accidental overdose.""And that is what we get here. Rene Zellweger gives a stunning performance as Judy Garland towards the end of her life. Never mind the fine line between channeling someone and satirizing someone, a line too often crossed. The movie travels back and forth in time from 1968/69 when she is in London for comeback and her days as a child star being groomed by MGM as a leading star. At MGM the child Judy is given pills to wake her up, help her sleep; gain weight, lose weight; keep her going, slow her down. All of this frankly depicted on screen. And in the film, a licentious Louise B. Mayer hinting at the sexual abuse she received from Hollywood big-wigs.The movie seemed fairly accurate despite the Hollywood hokum of a sing-along of ""Over The Rainbow"" to help a Judy who could not remember or complete the song. But, hey, it ain't called the land of make-believe for nothin'!It is an excellent film (only three people in the audience the night I attended) capturing the vulnerability that was Judy Garland. By March of 1969, from photos of her so cadaverous, at that point it would not have taken much to push Judy Garland over the edge. ""Accidental overdose"" is simply a shortcut to ascribe to a very sickly woman. Chronic alcoholics cannot process nutrients from food; she could have just as easily died from cardiac arrest,
stroke, or embolism.As a singer, in the list of top 100 songs (and I have no idea what list or whose list), I seem to recall that Judy Garland is represented with THREE in the top ten.

A touching, strong and undoubtedly moving perspective. The film lacks a little emphasis and important background stories, I mean more lenght and more deepining about the childhood story of Judy couldn't be that bad, but despite the ""small"" things, the film is an excellent perspective on the life of a victim of the system (although it was a unique talent) and apart from Zellweger, you will find unique environments, lines and atmospheres for a film of genre that is always risky to manage.

Zellweger is obsessed with making all those faces. So annoying. I think the real problem is we were so familiar with Judy Garland and you keep looking for her.

I am also not really a Renee Zellweger fan but admit she is a good actress and her performance in this movie blew me away.A movie that packs a punch at the end is shear story telling at it's finest. While Renee steals the movie the director Rupert Goold always the supporting cast to also shine on contribute without being overwhelmed by Renee's performance. Goold somehow managed to keep the movie balanced with equally strong actor's.Performing such a iconic legend does however come with it's perks and Renee proved to approach this project with not only professionalism but gently.

The movie in itself is ok... I think it portrays some of the pain and the difficult moments she's gone through but you know there's so much more they could've explored to make it more dramatical and emotional and it wouldn't have been an exaggeration.

Directed by Rupert Goold. Written by Tom EdgeJudy is about the last days of Judy Garland. She is trying to get her feet back on the ground while dealing with severe emotional trauma and drug problems. Judy Garland was a beautiful and incredibly talented woman who the Hollywood system ran through the meat grinder. She was not a person to them. She was a commodity and that infected how she lived her life throughout her days.I bring this movie up because of Renee Zellweger's recent Oscar win. She is not the person I picked to win that award. I picked Scarlett Johannson in Marriage Story to finally pick up her first Oscar. I was wrong on that and I had to find out what this movie was like.This movie is built entirely on Renee Zellweger's performance. It does take a moment for you to disassociate her from Judy Garland and Judy Garland to take over. She does eventually but she slips back into how she normally talks. It's not distracting and it is a performance of trauma and tragedy. She holds these emotions inside because she has to. She has no one to confide in, nobody who sees her for who she really is and not the person she is on stage.The rest of the film follows these sets of concerts in London where Judy Garland is trying to gain some money. She is having difficulty performing and people are watching her self destruct. So many people are taking advantage of her but at the same time there are those who see what's happening and want to help but aren't able to.I read an interview with her daughter Liza Minnelli about seeing this movie. She said she had no interest in seeing it. I don't blame her. Who would want to watch their mother's last moments? But I mentioned previously Renee Zellweger carries this film. She brings Judy Garland to life and honestly I didn't know that she had this in her. I know she won an Oscar before for Cold Mountain but she carries this trauma in her eyes and in her body language.There's a scene where she calls her daughter in America and it is a heartbreaking moment. She wants to tell her daughter the truth but shield her from the life she lived. She desperately wants to live with her kids and just be but she can't.I give this movie a C.",Judy

I do not know the full story of Judy Garland's short life but I like to naively believe that this movie reflected the spirit of what happened. That Zellweg did her own singing is testimony to her commitment to the role. I am guessing she saw this as an opportunity to do an important role in her life and it is a touching peformance. Zellweg seems to play forgettable roles with her big eyes and cutesy face, so I bet she tried really, really, really hard to land this big fish of a role. I liked that she laid off the mac and cheese and settled for lettuce and carrots to slim down for this role ... I could hardly tell that it was her hiding behind the make-up and wardrobe. I suspect though that through some misaligned respect, Judy Judy Judy was partially whitewashed and spring cleaned for the portrayal of her personality. It seems it is the season in the last couple of years to do a biopic of some big star. Have you noticed that all of these biopics of artificial heroes and heroines are always adored by the viewers? Most of these appear to be plasticky replicas of what could otherwise have been ... yet people adore them as they tell the story of a musical god or goddess who contributes to the unfolding of the Ameeerican success story. Congrats to the producers of Judy as it seems to me that it achieved the right balance for me for something that was touching and entertaining.",Judy
155,cockezville,Zellweger nails it but...,7,2 October 2019,"Renee Zellweger proves she has solid acting chops and gives a stellar performance as judy Garland with a script that definitely lacks guts. The direction was adequate but this could have been a better film with Renee and a solid script. She captures Garland nuances quite well. I wanted to like this film more, but it kind of fell flat.",Judy
156,madanmarwah,Renee's acting is the highlight,7,18 August 2021,"This is one movie I had missed out. Finally caught up with it. For Renee Zellweger this was a lifetime opportunity to essay the role of legendary American singer Judy Garland. And she has done exceedingly well in bringing to life this complex character in her ups and downs. The awards Renee has won is proof of her talent, if proof was necessary. In response to a heckler she says that she is Judy Garland only for an hour on stage and at all other times she is a normal person, wife and mother. Facing the demons of the past mainly related to her many affairs and five marriages, Judy tries to balance her time in showbiz with quality time with her two growing children. She is forced to temporarily relocate to London, away from her two children in order to settle her financial affairs.It may not be right for any reviewer to compare the scenes of the movie with the real life events . The issue is to evaluate how well the film is made with the script and screenplay available to the director.The movie follows a smooth narrative with Renee acting out the difficult scenes with finesse and bringing out the vulnerability of her character effectively. In quite a few scenes she gathers audience sympathy as the single mother forced by circumstances to stay away from her children. The songs are beautifully presented and the rendition of
"" Over the rainbow "" is memorable. The film has excellent costume design and cinematography, which give it class.",Judy
157,InlyCii,A fighter,8,22 March 2020,"For me, the least favorite is the biographical film, because the time review of the chronicle has no other interest except to let you find the light different from history in the ocean of historical knowledge. But ""Judy"" attracted me deeply, from her first voice opening, to her leaving with her child, and finally having to live with her ex-husband's house for the child, and then back to the stage to get her custody back to the stage. In the end, it was left to the wonderful world of ""Over the Rainbow"". In her life, she broke through her self-growth in order to fight against the Hollywood system.",Judy

We will never see the likes of her again.,10,18 September 2019,"Just in time for the 50th anniversary of her passing, this is a sparkling, yet honest closer look at the legendary 1968 ""Talk of the Town"" engagement, the promising effort for a physically and emotionally exhausted Judy Garland to reignite her fading career. Renee Zellweger has not only literally transformed into the mature Judy Garland, but also delivers impressive singing performances. The script, costumes and sets take the audience on a virtual trip back into the last days of the ultimate performer's life.Somewhere over the rainbow...Judy looks down and smiles. There will never be another Judy Garland, but Renee Zellweger's portrayal comes pretty close.",Judy

160,xpat-55192,Blew Me Away!,10,21 September 2020,"Of course I had heard of Judy Garland. The Wizard of OZ and Somewhere Over The Rainbow.
But that was the extent of my knowledge of what I learned was a tragically overburdened shooting star.
Cruelly, Judy seemed to be marked for pressurised burn-out from early in life.
I think this excellent film is ultimately a sad narrative of a wonderfully-gifted but increasingly fragile artiste and it was so well done that it could rightly be called a tragic masterpiece.
The entire cast was superb and Renee Zellweger herself gets a solid 11 as Judy. And her singing is great!
I thoroughly recommend it.",Judy
161,darius_sutherland,A Bit Bleak,6,21 January 2020,As other reviewers have mentioned it was a bit bleak. Depressing moments after depressing moments. I think it could have transitioned from her youth leading up to her death but it focused on her remaining years. Renee was good but I have no idea if she was like Garland or not. I've seen far better biopics than this.,Judy
162,zendatrim,Totally believable performance by Zellweger breathtaking,10,15 February 2020,"I just watched this Judy played by Renee Zellweger. I had no idea how tragic Judy Garlands life really was. She was in some respects abused by the studio MGM as she was denied food and sleep and was made to rely on drugs to stop her being hungry or to help her sleep as she worked ridiculous hours trying to finish The Wizard of Oz.She wasnt allowed to eat properly in case she put weight on. This was directly down to the attitude of studio chief Louis B. Mayer, who referred to her as his ""little hunchback"".the treatment she endured as a child acting was sadly what gave her such a short life, she died at 47 alone. She abused her body, with drink and drugs and denied herself and was malnourished.I thought Renee captured her brilliantly i found it hard to watch at times and had to stop the film to take a break as it was so emotional to see her remembering her childhood and how things were.She was a truly talented person who was denied emotional support and made to suffer long hours all for the sake of finishing a film on time.I had no idea the real story behind her life, and it has shocked me to be honest. It must have been hard for Renee to immerse herself into the character so fully. I know that Lisa Minelli her daughter cant bear to watch the film and i can understand why.Its truly awe inspiring and so brilliantly executed I think it should win the Oscars and Renee should for best actress, i have never cried so much and laughed too as thankfully there were some bits one could do that.Its worth watching I got it on Amazon for 9.99 worth every penny.",Judy
163,rhmacl,RZ has revolutionized biopics; only sainthood left fir her...,10,1 October 2019,"I used to use Angela Bassett's performance as Tina Turner as the 'world-class' standard for biopic films. The transformation into Tina was haunting, hair-raising, chilling.... As good as it is and always will be, it fails to achieve the same ultra haunting, hair-raising, breath-stealing achievement that has been brought to the screen by Renée Zellweger ... that's right, two ""L""s and one ""G"" ... you'll never forget that again because this performance will be discussed as superlative hyperbole for decades and ya gotta get the name spelled right!! Maybe the unfairness of H'wood's ignorant over-look of her Chicago performance and the subsequent Cold Mountain accommodation still 'smarts.' It probably hurt to be overlooked then 'tossed' some supporting statuette. She disappeared for a bit, re-armed herself with more than just her talents, and has delivered an undeniable masterpiece. I am flabbergasted, gobstopped, touched, inspired, pleased, satisfied and planning on getting back in to the theater so I can see it again and again...Oh... and RZ sings! She is THE voice in this film and she is not quite the ""Carnegie Hall"" Judy of '61, but she has pipes and most importantly, has captured the spirit of the entertainer inclusive of those tiny nuances that remind us of Judy's ever-present humanity. Great 'big-screen' love is a great thing to sing about...but every night....? Renée shows us all the skills it takes to do so but retains the limitations that even iconic entertainers experience.Bravo!",Judy
164,jackson_ro,Judy,8,12 February 2020,"Judy exhumes Oscar, but the story of Judy Garland, a name that is universally recognized deserves this movie and the performance by Renee Zellweger, goes beyond that of silverware. It's a sad tale, one of a disturbed individual who is confused and lost by fame, love and family, but always shines on the brightest stage. That quote from Wizard of Oz at the very end sums up the life of Judy pretty well, ""a heart is not measured by how much you love, but how much you are loved by others"", and Judy Garland's life was very much embodied by this mentality. The film itself just felt right and is hard to nitpick, the lighting, the overall setting and mood, and all the characters simply set up the stage for Renee to deliver her performance of a lifetime.",Judy
165,lakishaferguson21,Worth a view,6,22 July 2020,"I enjoyed this film, thought Renee did a very good job of being sympathetic yet strong although at times her physical ""tics"" were sllightly distracting.

To me it seemed like Garland's life was Quite sad around this time period.",Judy
166,pamma09,"Renee is a 10, the movie a 9",9,6 October 2019,"This is such a good performance by Renee Zellweger as Judy. Her last year was tragic - she had lost her children whom she loved with all her heart, broke and playing places that appreciated her but did not pay much.
Flashbacks to the time while making The Wizard of Oz - not the best way of treating a young girl and if known now it would have not been allowed. She grew up without love and searched for it with her own children.
An unknown cast (to me) and they are good - especially Jesse Buckley.
A side note - I saw Judy in concert when I was 9 (1955) and I will never forget it - she sang Somewhere Over the Rainbow while sitting on the edge of the stage and wearing the hobo costume. Renee's lines before she sings it in the movie says so much and she does the song so much justice. I so hope Renee gets an oscar nomination - she deserves it.",Judy

I was for nearly two hours watching-enjoying an incredible personification of Ms. Judy Garland by Zellweger. Yes, the mannerisms, the singing, the acting it was just fabulous! I loved the idea of the story line did not focus on Ms. Garland's addiction to drugs but, to the struggles of the last few months of Ms. Garland's life with back and forth flashbacks remembering why she became a victim of her past. Throughout the whole film, I was submerged as I was watching Judy.
This film is a Love Letter to Garland! Loved it!",Judy
169,helenbassett,Judy Film Review - Rupert Goold Directs Renée Zellweger Wearing The Ruby Slippers That Can Carry You Down The Yellow Brick Road - But Not Home Again,10,8 October 2019,"Born Frances Ethel Gumm, that didn't have a Hollywood ring to it. But Judy Garland was still the 'fat-ankled, snag-toothed rube(?) from Grand Rapids' as told to her by Richard Cordery's Louis B. Mayer, on the set of Wizard Of Oz. Now let's see what you've got Judy, as Shirley Temple, America's Sweetheart was also auditioning. Everyone wanted to be Dorothy Gale. Including Mayer's little hunchback. Really Harvey? But there was only one Judy Garland. And generations of children have grown up Over The Rainbow in the last 80 years. The Wizard Of Oz sharing the holiday tv listings with older Judy's Meet Me In St Louis. And we're all Friends of Dorothy here. But if celluloid Dorothy Gale never gets old, Judy Garland did. And that's when Rupert Goold directs Renée Zellweger in Judy. When Oz must feel just like a dream.The recent Lorraine Kelly case where the court agreed her tax avoidance case because she appears on tv as 'Lorraine Kelly', a self-employed 'performer', rather than herself as an ITV employee. The 'friendly, chatty and fun personality' is all part of the tv act she portrays. No doubt she goes home and turns into the tragic Judy Garland, high on drugs and booze. Or maybe she just had better tax lawyers. Because Judy Garland was always Judy Garland. And she was unable to Surrender Dorothy, for in 1969 Judy is broke, on her fourth divorce, and looking for a place to sleep with her children. Part of the stage act with her now, and their regular hotel has had to let her suite go. For non payment of the bill.I think we can all agree this is no life for children. And Judy knows it. MGM Judy is played by the phenomenal Darci Shaw, as she experiences all the horror stories we know about Judy's early life in the studio system. The pills that put her to sleep, that wake her up and keep her weight down. And the 18 hour days. But fortunately no Munchkins! And even having her own Miss Gulch as chaperone who refuses to allow her to celebrate her own (early fake) birthday, or eat the cake. Or a burger at lunch, while Mickey Rooney tucks in! There's an irony.But with no other choice for Judy that night, she takes the children to her ex Sidney Luft's rather nice home. I guess that's where her money went; lawyers paying off her husbands. Settling the children with Rufus Sewell, she then makes her way to older daughter Liza Minelli's party central. A huge success, and winning the Oscar that Judy never won for Cabaret. Maybe this time...Gemma-Leah Devereux's Liza is unconcerned about an upcoming project, where Judy seems to suffer terrible stage fright. Until the lights turn towards her and she lights up.And in a desperate attempt to make money it's the London stage lights at The Talk of The Town that Judy winds up at. If she can make enough money she can have her kids live with her. Like Stan & Ollie before her it's a bold move, and Jessie Buckley's Rosalyn Wilder is a kindly much younger chaperone on hand to help.Renée is a twitchy, fidgety, befuddled mess as Judy, but her wit is razor sharp. Even if her self-flagellation cuts deep. Respect to her for creating such an epic performance. The pills that set Judy on the treadmill to her destruction for life, mix with the booze, and on Opening Night she's in her bathroom drunk. Rosalyn gets her dressed, her make-up is slapped on and it's off to Oz. We wait nervously to see how Judy will perform, and amazingly she nails it. Ripping those songs out of that frail tiny body. The performances are an agony to watch after what we know of her life.That night Judy is a success, but as Rupert Goold directs, not every night was a hit. Sometimes it was a cabaret of booze, drugs, desperation, and a side order of bread rolls. And sometimes it was even Lonnie Donegan. As Michael Gambon's theatre manager looks on in horror.But she could bypass the ears and go straight to the heart, as Andy Nyman (his Ghost Stories is terrific), and Daniel Cerqueira playing two fans, describe her. And a meal with them gives Judy a moment to be almost normal. She could empathise with how the gay community had also suffered. Clearly always an Icon, the film is based on the stage play End of the Rainbow by Peter Quilter, but Ole Bratt Birkeland creates the cinematic magic around her.A final chance at happiness comes with Finn Wittrock's Mickey Deans, as a room service order. But Judy Garland was never a happy story. Even hesitating to eat a piece of cake after all those years.And a 5 week contract is a long time when you are already ill.With Rupert Goold's direction and screenplay by Tom Edge, Judy is the sun that everything radiates from, but the movie belongs to Renée Zellweger. She sings the role of a lifetime. The hair, the make-up and meticulously designed costumes by Jany Temime, dressing her in a star studded wardrobe that bring her story alive. The love story and happiness that she gave the world, but couldn't quite find for herself. Because she could never really fly Over the Rainbow.But 30 years after she first sang that song her audience will still sing it with her in a moving finale.Heartbreaking. And Oscar ready.",Judy
170,VikiLauda,Powerfull performances!,6,8 January 2020,"I actuually really like ""Judy"" & in my opinion Rene Zellweger is now firmly cemented as an Oscar worthy actress. Zellwegers performance is intense, emotive & utterly captivating, however... It was a huge mistake & terrible shame she sang her own vocals. Judy Garland had the most iconic voice in movie history & very sadly Rene Z just dident come anywhere near that ""voice"" & some songs sounded false & over performed. However I also enjoyed Rufus Sewells performance as bad boy Sid Luft & Finn Wittrock as night club owner Micky Deans who brought love smiles & laughter to Judy's final year. I firmly believe those of us who just like biographies will enjoy Judy as Rene Zellweger give this her 110%! Well done lovely lady! x",Judy
171,rogerdob,Fatal mistake not to use Garland's voice during musical numbers,1,6 October 2019,Why didn't the producers take a cue from Hungarian Rhapsody's decision to use Freddie Mercury's actual recordings. To listen to non-singer Renee Zellweger try to sing like Judy (with the aid of lots of studio digital adjustments) is a waste of time when one is viewing a film that celebrates her talent. NO ONE SOUNDS LIKE JUDY! This film should have been a cinematic record of Judy...instead it is a film about an actress (Renee) who had the gall to want to use her own voice instead of Judy's for whatever egotistical needs she had to feed.,Judy

Perhaps it's just the dark mood of this era, but I found myself wanting to see a little relief; a fun moment, a little sparkle, in this bleak portrayal of the saddest, darkest part of a star's big life. Rocketman left me feeling the same. I wish we could see some of the fabulous times in life to balance out the bleak dispair.
The fillmmakers did a great disservice to Judy Garland when they decided to use Renee's voice instead of lipsyncing to Garland's actual tracks. I lingered over the movie just because I wanted to see the screen to suddenly come alive with Judy's enormous sound amidst the darkness of her stage performances. It would have shown the reason why the audiences kept coming to see her. Good an actor as she is Renee just doesn't have the pipes to pull that kind of sound.",Judy

Rene Zellweger doesn't have the clout as an actress to pull off the complexities of Garland's personality. Sorry Rene.

179,JanJanuary,Fantastic performance,10,8 October 2019,"I watched all of JG's films since I was young, and her on stage performances and TV shows. The film Judy is just a great film with a wonderful performance by RZ. At times JG came through on her voice and her mannerisms, but not all the time. I would have liked to have heard more familiar JG songs, The Man That Got Away, Born in a Trunk, and a stage version of Get Happy. But what we were given was great. A sad, tragic figure. I thought everyone knew Judy's story of popping pills (apparently on instruction by the film studio according to her), her homosexual father and husband, and problem mother (where were her sisters who were part of the Gumm Sisters act). But my friends didn't know much about her. Didn't like the scene with Mr Meyer giving JG a pep talk and the insinuation that he touched her (whilst saying about singing from the heart and touching there) it was a little off camera so it's left to us to decide. Another great name besmirched? I don't recall reading anything inappropriate happening in JG's biography. Anyway a great, enjoyable film with a moving rendition of OTR. Have to admit tears were falling.PA: Only thing I found off putting was Renee's constantly screwing up her face, which is natural to her, but just reminded me of her Bridget Jones character. Director should have kept an eye on her.",Judy
180,kennprop,Very well acted,8,12 October 2019,"Very well acted,but the story of Judy Garlands horrible studio life, mother abuse, and ending is very depressing and sad.

Both Renee Zellweger and the young woman who plays Judy as a young star are excellent, and Zellweger is so good she had me feeling as though I was watching Judy herself returned to life and navigating the twists and turns (and hopes) of the life she lived near the end. I was especially taken by the memorable extreme closeups the director and cinematographer used at crucial moments in the film: The idea worked for me, creating indelible, focused intensity that stayed with me after leaving the theater. I feel like this biopic was one of the most successful I've seen in trying to give the viewer an opportunity to understand what might have gone on in a fading star's head as she lived her final months, and exactly how she may have accidentally ingested too high of a dosage of the pills she had known since her childhood in the studio system. By the way, I thought this would inevitably, definitely be a difficult, sad watch as a film, but I left the theater feeling thoughtful and peaceful, and grateful for this tribute to someone who had been so stereotyped, ridiculed, and dismissed by many, especially near the end of her life, and after. ""Judy"" makes a touching effort to flesh out the real human being who went through all of this, and lets us decide how we choose to remember her.",Judy

183,rich-fouts,Excruciating pace,6,17 October 2019,I am OK with a slow paced film if there's a good reason but I didn't see that in this case. Renée Zellweger obviously did her homework and worked very hard to capture the essence of Judy Garland's final year. But when you see a movie about Judy Garland you want to hear Judy Garland. As good as Zellweger is it just doesn't feel like a film about the spectacular Garland. Solid performance by Rufus Sewell who is always good and Finn Wittrock also very good. But overall I struggled to understand just exactly what story this film was trying to tell given there is no classic plot. I could definitely see why this would make a better stage play.,Judy
184,mharah,It's really not a bio-pic...,7,19 October 2019,"...for a variety of reasons. But that doesn't mean it isn't an important window into the last year of Judy Garland's life. Renee Zellweger gives a bravura performance as Garland, and the obvious reality that so much of the narrative is, shall we say, conceptualized, gives Zellweger a much freer reign to create the character.Judy Garland died 50 years ago, so this film, based on a 2005 musical play by Peter Quilter, is a long way from first hand information. And while the highlights - actual events - have always been well-known, the details are probably not. And this rendition is very dependent of those details. Since many who were close to Garland were, by the time of the underlying play probably long gone themselves, it is probably safe to assume that more than a bit of the narrative was left to ""filling in the blanks."" That is the strength of ""Judy."" We may never know the actual conversations - so important in this film, but they are undoubtedly as faithful as they need to be, and that is the strength of the filmJudy is probably not an historically accurate portrayal, but it doesn't need to.",Judy

188,Paddy-49,A Brilliantly told story,8,15 November 2019,"""Judy"" is not a biopic that tries to tell the full Judy Garland story - far from it. But what it does - showing events from her last sad year - it does brilliantly. It also has a few flashbacks to Judy the young teen starlet which illuminate and part explain the main story. As a child Garland was exploited - as an adult as well and here we are looking at her extreme vulnerability brought on by her success and her problems in coping with it. She was never a ""normal"" person who had a normal life. She was always in the spotlight - not just her performances but her life as well. Indeed as so often with a great performer the life and the work become merged. One part that she was always playing was that of ""Judy"". Was it a mask - up to a point it was, but one that was superglued on.Renee Zellweger does not impersonate Judy Garland - she does much more than that. She gets into and inhabits the heart and soul of Garland. But it is not a slight of hand caricature - indeed some of the mannerisms are pure Zellweger, but they work perfectly. She tells the story but not in a literal way. The script and direction create a fiction which tells the story rather better than a strict adherence to the facts would. Many of the scenes are invented, even improbable. But that doesn't matter as they illuminate the truth about Judy better than a totally authentic biography would. Remember we are trying to understand a life of 47 years compressed into just under two hours. It has to be minimalist but still be true, and it is.Do you believe that Zellweger is Judy Garland? I would say unquestionably so. At no time do you think ""Judy wouldn't have done that"" - the portrayal is authentic in what it seeks to do. The visual effect is at times stunning - not least in the live performance segments. I went to the ""Talk of the Town"" in the 1960s and recall it just as it is shown in the movie. The patrons, sitting at their dinner tables, were very close indeed to the performers, or many were. When it worked for Judy this showed her at her engaging, personable best. When it didn't work - if she was under the influence - it was horrific. Bread rolls and worse were thrown. As fans we build up our stars, but if they fail us we don't always forgive them.""Judy"" is quite claustrophobic at times. Judy Garland was famously born in a suitcase and she seems to have spent much of her life living in one - but in the public gaze all the time. Her talent was extraordinary - and it is to Zellweger's enormous credit that the theatre performances do it credit. This is not ersatz Garland it's the real thing. Alongside her I warmed to Jessie Buckley as Rosalyn Wilder the young woman tasked with looking after the star. This is a very clever portrayal and whilst at first you sympathised with her that her task as ""minder"" was almost impossible at the end you envied her as she realised that life doesn't offer many chances to be so close to an icon.London in the late 1960s was recreated well - it was the era of the Grade/Delfont family who created much of British popular entertainment of the time. Michael Gandon is excellent as Bernard Delfont. It is a well-cast film but there is only one ""star"" and nobody in the film, as in life, who was close to her really challenges that.

Alas, Garland's life eptomized the Hollywood cautionary tale of child stars.Despite massive talent, and amazing work ethic, alcohol, prescription drugs, bad husband choices, despicable studio bosses, and an even worse mother, gave her little chance to bypass tragedy.Renee clearly did her homework, nailing the nuances of Garland's personality, trooper attitude, eccentric stage mannerisms, and distinctive vocals - The buy-in to Renee as Judy was immediate and never wavered.Brief flashbacks take us back to production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" whose namesake himself couldn't save Judy from the Mother from Hell or the Boss From Hell (Louis B Mayer), for just the right amount of time to give the story supporting background fill.This is largely a spotlight film role for Renee, fitting for the part of Judy Garland whose spotlighted roles carried films.Renee delivers to the audience a still enthusiastic, but destitute and barely ""functional alcoholic"" Judy Garland who still has her trade-mark trooper-attitude pragmatism, but is desperately trying to earn enough money to just have a place to sleep for her children and ends up taking the only gig she can get (In London where her fandom still burns bright and large) that gives her hope to earn enough money to right her sinking ship, and retain custody of her children back in America after her 4th divorce.Judy's final tragic journey in her life is a roller coaster of desperation and sad realizations.Renee hits one out of the park (and over the rainbow) putting forth what is clearly the best Lead Actress performance of the year thus far, earning her a 10/10, and elevating 'Judy' to an overall 8/10. Bravo",Judy
190,superfox_888,Wasted talent,6,17 October 2021,"Renee Zellweger is phenomenal as Judy. She had the lip pout, the mannerisms, the vibe (and most of the voice, no one can perfectly do Judy's voice). However, there was no plot to speak of. The film feels episodic between flashbacks to her early days at MGM and her London shows. If the climax is Somewhere Over the Rainbow to an adoring audience, it fell very flat.Life was rough for Judy. Renee captures that perfectly. If you're a fan of either Renee or Judy, it's worth a watch. But if you're hoping for a film with superb storytelling, or juicy gossip, or a linear narrative, this isn't it.",Judy

The perception of the film was enhanced by the fact that I was alone in the cinema.",Judy
192,jmholmes-73727,Wham! out Of the Park&over the Rainbow,10,9 October 2019,"Renee Zellwigger's nuanced, intense performance is so startling that it takes nearly 20 minutes to see beyond the somewhat aging face, wig , make-up and fidgety gestures to the woman we remember from Chicago and the Bridget Jones movies. It may not technically qualify as a comeback, but it certainly feels like one. And, apparently, she can sing, too - at least well enough to imitate Judy in her final, very troubled months. Audiences old enough to recall Judy's last talk show interviews and the publicity around her final performances will see how accurately the actress and costume designer capture her look and physical gestures on stage. My only complaint is that no film clips of the real Judy were inserted to remind us (at least younger audiences) of
the many movies and television appearances - her own weekly series in the 1960's - in which she starred. Ms. Zellwigger's blazing performance would not have been diminished if this had been done.",Judy
193,classicactresses,Could Have Been Better,6,17 June 2020,This is an OK biography of Judy Garland but it has some problems. First of all there is way too much singing. Renee isn't a bad singer but she is no Judy Garland. Also the movie doesn't even mention the fact that her husband Mickey Deans was gay! Renee Zelwegger does give a good performance and you can see how unhappy and sick Judy was at the end. If you're a huge Judy fan you'll probably enjoy this move but it's not one I'd want to watch again.,Judy
194,faroukgulsara,"Of hopes, dreams, obsessions and nightmare...",8,28 February 2020,"When the mythical Pandora Box finally opened, all the evil virtues flew out, leaving only hope. Well, one can assume that when everything is gone, and one is down and out, there is always hope for one to start over.But then, conversely, one could ask why hope is there in the first place among unsavoury traits like jealousy and gluttony. Is it that sometimes, even hope gives a false sense of surety that masks the situation of the ground? Could hope, after the initial useful jumpstart progress to some kind of obsession? The dream to excel becomes so essential that one forgets to slumber. One needs to sleep to dream but then what ensues is just a nightmare when several self-defeating means are deployed to hope against hope to keep the dream, which is now only a delusion, alive.'Judy' is the story of a child prodigy, Judy Garland, at the tail end of her sad life. Coming from a showbiz family, she and her two sisters were in a vaudeville called Gumm Sisters. Judy skyrocketed to stardom at an early age. (who doesn't know Dorothy Gale in Wizard of Oz?). In the dog eat dog world of Hollywood, staying afloat is no easy feat. Drugs and intoxicants, which kept her stay relevant through the years, finally reared their ugly heads in her later years. With poor business management, bad life choices and spiralling legal fees, Judy had to fight a losing battle to win custody of her two children.Her labile temperament and frequent absences from shows made it even more problematic.I thought Rene Zellweger gave a stellar performance as a 40-something Judy as she tried to redeem herself as a singer in the London clubs before her demise due to barbiturate overdose.",Judy
195,babybuletgani,Trotting from sleepless hotel bed to backstage chaos,8,23 October 2019,"Trotting from sleepless hotel bed to backstage chaos, and never far from a bottle, it's a compelling, dryly witty portrait of an aging icon on the skids. But director Rupert Goold (True Story) layers it nimbly with Garland's origin story, in colour-saturated flashbacks to the punishing shoot for 1939's the wizard of oz that sealed her fate. MGM's best money-maker was an abused teen, on a ruthless regime of crash-dieting, pill-popping and work. Faced with rebellion, mogul Louis B. Mayer bullies Judy mercilessly: ""You're a fat-ankled, snaggle-toothed rube from Grand Rapids."" Studded with stinging memories and chewy themes (such as the tug-of-war between family and fame), Tom Edge's script, adapted from Peter Quilter's hit play End Of The Rainbow, is needle-sharp and mostly free of showbiz schmaltz. Garland's stage fright and famous unreliability keeps things tense, making Zellweger's first-night transformation from droopy old drunk to stage-storming trouper roaring 'By Myself' an absolute belter.
Goold's camera sticks second-skin close to Zellweger, generating a nervy intimacy as it slides through pitchperfect '60s interiors. For a small movie, Judy glitters with confidence, especially in the stage performances, shot mercilessly close with few cuts, like a concert film. But Goold's fierce concentration on his leading lady means fine supporting performances (Rufus Sewell's weary ex-husband Sid Luft or Finn Wittrock's starstruck boyfriend, subject of a hopeful romance) get little legroom. The exception is a cosy sub-plot in which gay fans Stan and Dan have the encounter of their dreams.
Like a livelier Jackie, the film is a transfixed, unflinching up-close look at a legend. Zellweger carries it off magnificently, her trademark combo of wit and vulnerability fitting Garland as expertly as her silk stage-suits. In an extraordinary vanity-free performance (Garland resembled a haggard if perky pixie by this stage), she pivots from heartsick, long-distance mothering to full-wattage showbiz queen in an instant. She has Garland's twitchy mannerisms and resilient wisecracking down pat, but this is more masterly interpretation than impersonation. As is her singing voice, no longer the breathy coo of Chicago but a smoky, surprisingly powerful instrument that wraps itself around the viewer. When she goes over the rainbow, you're going with her.",Judy
196,Brad_G35,Zellweger is the story here.,5,2 February 2020,"Judy's post Oz story is tragic. It's unfortunate that she died early.As for this movie, I don't think it's a must watch. I watched it because I'm racing to watch all the Oscar noms before the ceremony. Zellweger is truly the story here. Had it not been for her, this movie wouldn't have received so much praise. She truly is firing on all cylinders here.Regarding Zellweger, I think she did a great job of showing Judy's undying love for her children. I knew about Judy but I didn't realize that she cared about her kids so much.I don't have much to say about the film. See it for Zellweger if you have 2 hours to kill. I doubt she will take the Oscar here but it's a great performance.",Judy

""Judy"" is a great film. There are brief flashes of Garland's early life (or indenture) at MGM, but I was somewhat disappointed to see nothing of her early performances in The Any Hardy films, and very little of the great musical numbers in 'The Harvey Girls', 'Easter Parade', and 'Meet Me in Saint Louis', the last of which I believe included a scene with the infant Liza Minelli.",Judy

She must and will win the Oscar for Best Leading Actress this year for her performance as legendary Judy Garland.,Judy
199,ivo_shandor,Creepy when you think about it,6,28 September 2020,"Definitely an awards season film, although a pretty sad depiction of the life of Garland; though her life was pretty tragic in real life. Zellweger is the best thing in the film, she looks and acts exactly like Judy in her later years. The film is more of a look into Judy's behavior at the end of her life, what led to it at these specific moments of her life. A lot of stuff in the movie feels creepy and felt more like a message in regards to the current state of cultural sensitivity. Although, a movie like this almost feels oddly perfect for the current times, you almost want a biopic like Ed Wood, something lighthearted and done with a fairy tale flair. It makes the movie feel cold and unfriendly, but the sad truth is, that was the life of Judy's up until the end of her career towards. The movie could use a few more brighter, hopeful moments in regards to Judy's legacy, though there are a few scenes like that towards the end. Overall, a very good movie, great performances, and I'm sure Zellweger will be nominated for Best Actress. It could use more of a flair and a hopefulness like most biopics, but it makes you feel like Judy did in her final days, which isn't the best feeling in the world. I'm sure it was the intention of the filmmakers, but sometimes we could use a little whimsy and heart; something to make you feel brighter for having Judy in the world. When you think about biopics of figures in Hollywood, Chaplin with Robert Downey, Jr. comes to mind, and while Chaplin didn't have the best life at times, the movie has a charm that ties into his character and translates that feeling of joy and triumph to the audience. Not that Judy's life was life Chaplin's, but a feeling of joy towards her legacy would make the film a little better and more endearing. It would have been a little more whimsical if we had a montage of her film roles, her music, maybe something like Rocketman, a movie with some flair and charm. If it's a look into her life, then the movie did it's job, but it feels distant and weird. It's a period piece of a damaged person, and people tend to be drawn to those movies. Zellweger gives the best performance of her career, and overall it's a good movie, but not great.",Judy

201,salmineo,Vanity project,4,9 January 2020,"I just finished it. It was a good movie, but Renne Zellweger never takes on the character of Judy Garland. She does her typical pucker lips duckface gestures, squinty eyes schtick and whines like a stereotypical NYC Jewish woman. Judy Garland didn't whine like that while talking and pucker her lips. Watch her old interviews on YouTube. She also didn't sing like Judy at all. It's a decent movie, but doesn't succeed as a biopic. It's a vanity project that's entertaining, but nothing deep or more. An unknown actress that could ""wow"" with an electrifying performance would have been a better choice. Now I see why it barely broke $35 million at the box office.

An actor playing Mickey Rooney is depicted in several scenes involving Judy Garland's early career. Another pan review stated that her son Joe Loft was not portrayed in the film. He certainly was!

212,Camelot_2000,The Sunset of A Golden Hollywood Career,10,10 October 2020,"The legend of Judy Garland lives on. We've all see the Wizard of OZ at one point or another and know her dream to go ""Over The Rainbow"". The glitz and glamour and the allegedly, ""Hollywood Happiness"" wasn't truly there though. Judy had major problems with drugs and alcohol and this film perfectly showcases that.It clearly shows that the sunset of her career was plagued with financial problems, addictions and the despairing wish to be with her children again once her gig was done in England. This film clearly showed the downward spiral her career took. She was trying to make a comeback in England, but the problems with her health and well being caused a lot of heckling and criticism from the public. She was even insulted off the stage at one point due to her drunken delirious performance.Hats off to Rene Zellweger though for her top of the mark performance of this troubled movie star. She IS Judy Garland! Her portrayal of this legendary actress is the best depiction ever. She carries the woman's personality and angst right down to a tee. It doesn't surprise me that she won an Academy Award for that.Judy's problems with drugs is clearly made clear at the beginning when she was pressured at a young age by Louis B. Mayer to strictly maintain a ""good girl"" image. Her desire to eat and enjoy food was replaced with pills to diminish her appetite. The studio didn't want her to gain any weight. They triggered off an eating disorder which would ultimately affect the rest of her life afterwards.Their pill pushing actions towards her also caused major damage. This ""good girl"" image made her into a unhappy drug addict and one that would later prove to be fatal. The repercussions of that can clearly be seen as she struggles to make money by taking what she could get, no matter where the location is.Her early life was clearly depicted as a strictly controlled one. It's made obvious she had feelings for Mickey Rooney during their co-starring days in those squeaky clean musical movies when they were young, but he made it clear he wasn't interested in her. He saw her as just a ""buddy"".She'd later look back on that and mention how he became ""fat and bald"" as he got older. The sparks were there between them in their 1940s movies, but that wasn't the case at all in real life.It's always been well known that Judy Garland was a troubled star in her later years and this movie absolutely gives a perfect depiction of that. She loved the applause and wanted to keep it going right up until the end. This is an excellent peek into her last days. I highly recommend it.",Judy

215,OlgaGorelik,"Beloved, but unloved. Powerful story. Mediocre movie.",6,26 January 2020,"Sometimes a story is so powerful, even a mediocre movie can't undermine it. Judy is that movie. It reveals how beloved child actress Judy Garland (Darci Shaw) was basically enslaved by the studio, overworked, starved, emotionally abused, and drugged. Fake dates, fake birthday parties. We learn that from the flashbacks. Present day Judy (Renee Zellweger) is what that seems to have lead to some 30 years later. She's unemployable, broke, and basically homeless. Not quite sleeping on the street, yet, but not knowing where she and her kids will spend the night. Well, the kids can go to their father. Which tears her apart. She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep. It's a miracle she can stand upright, let alone sing. She manages to hold it together, whatever pills it takes. Until she can't. It was a torture to watch. But she picks up the tattered pieces, puts them back together, and tries to carry on, whatever pills it takes. Always smiling when asked if she is ok. Or if she will be. Beloved, but unloved, she latches on to anyone showing affection. Her relationship with Mickey (Finn Wittrock) was where I thought the movie faltered the most. I just never got to the point where I could trust him. Maybe that was the idea, but the whole thing just felt off. Overall I was engaged enough, that it wasn't until after the movie that I started questioning things. Like why wasn't she getting any child support? Zellweger did an admirable job fleshing out this complex character, most notably making her sympathetic, but not always likeable. Although I couldn't help noticing facial mannerisms that are distinctly, and distractingly, Renee. But most disappointingly, the film as a whole felt kind of bland.",Judy

219,thetyvonlesure,A Dry Biopic for an Icon,6,10 October 2019,"Judy is a film about the legendary Judy Garland. Despite being a biopic, the film falls short in capturing the essence of Judy Garland. Judy Garland is best known for her portrayal of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. This film makes little reference to the Wizard of Oz, or much of her career. It lightly touches upon the abuse and hardship Judy Garland faced in working in Hollywood. The story of this film is a great disservice to the iconography of Judy Garland.The story is incredibly dry. It's set during her final tour in London. Instead of showing the evolution of her as a person, we are given a shell of Judy. The film focuses on her at her worst without addressing her at her best. Sprinkled within the story are brief flashbacks that serve no real purpose. The story is dry because it overlooks the impact of Judy by focusing on her uneventful, and miserable final year. The primary setting of London is incredibly drab and boring. Hollywood is absent in 90% of this movie. The story presents the audience with no reason for caring about Judy. It's a generic take on an icon.Renée Zellweger carries this film. From start to finish, her portrayal of Judy Garland is masterful. Her acting is Oscar-Worthy. Zellweger's portrayal of Judy's addiction and her insomnia feel real. Her body shape and mannerisms parallel the real Judy Garland. Zellweger absorbed herself into the role of Judy Garland, and gave a perfect performance. Every emotion is heartfelt and tangible. Her singing is not akin to Judy Garland's (which emphasizes what a unique figure she was). However, her singing is well done. Renée Zellweger is this film's saving grace.The cinematography of the film is solid. Brief moments feature poor camera work, whereas the scenes in which she is on stage are beautiful. The camera work bounces between excellent and poor. The audio follows the precedent of the cinematography. It bounces from excellent to poor. The supporting cast is bland and interchangeable. At times it feels like Zellweger is acting in a Television Movie. The characters outside of Judy are predictable and one dimensional. The actors portraying these characters are also very dry.Overall, Judy is a film with a generic storyline that does not fully capture the significance or importance of Judy Garland. Renée Zellweger carries this film by giving a performance of a lifetime. Judy feels like a film made for television, starring one of the industry's best actors giving her best performance.",Judy

Or at least that is what I remember. It made me feel sad and thinking about her life. Because we only get to see a small, sad part of it. Was this all they could do for her?

It's a wonderful film that celebrates the complicated star and her demons in an extremely mature and contemplated way.At the forefront is Renée Zellweger who gives the performance of a career. She so easily slips into the role of Judy Garland it is sometimes uncanny. Her performance is the heart and soul of the film that carries it to the finish line. This is no doubt one of the finest performances from not only an actress this year but for acting in general. Zellweger truly has given this role her all and it shows.The film is wonderfully filmed directed and written upon many other things and doesn't shy away from the dark moments in Judy's life without going into too much explicit detail. It still manages to truly celebrate this icon in truly grand fashion.This is truly one of the best experiences I have had watching a film this year. It has heart and powerful performances on top of its powerful story. It manages to celebrate the life of Judy in a meaningful way and the end of the film will bring you to tears.

I've usually thought generally positively of Zellweger however her portrayal here was a standout performance... both intense and with just the right amount of desperation (considering what Garland was going through) without going overboard and hamming it up. It's hard to feel pity for a rich and glamorous actress that has wasted it all away, but by the end Ms Zellweger had me in tears.

228,mattclap28,Gold At The End Of The Rainbow,9,13 November 2019,"The past twelve months we have been blessed with magnificent biographical stories with truly memorable performances. Judy will and does not disappoint. The performance of Renee Zellweger is exemplary, absolutely flawless. Her portrail of Miss Garland is not one of a happy life, but one of a tortured soul barley surviving from her addictions.Depending where you want the film to go is where detraction could occur. It mainly deals with her final years as she travels to London for a tour to get money to win her children's custody. On her children, its only the two youngest that really get mentioned (Liza is already a star and seen once). You get flashbacks of her time on the set of Wizard of Oz setting the scene for what led to her problems. So there is no highlights of her life to enjoy.The female lead actress for 2020 should go to Renee, for that alone the film is worth it.",Judy
229,mariuchka,Watchable,5,2 January 2020,I remember the real Judy Garland so it's hard to picture Renee Zellweger as being Judy Garland. She did a fairly good job in portraying the last few years of Judy's life. I don't know why they always pick out the negative part of a celebrity's life and not some of the earlier years and how they got discovered and how they fell in love and had their children. This is not an upper movie. So little is left out of this movie but Renee doesn't pretty good job as portraying Judy's last sad years. But I cannot give this a higher rating because the movie part wasn't very good but the acting was good.,Judy

237,Art Snob,"Zellweger shines, but storyline has too many blind spots",7,23 September 2019,"I caught this film at this year's TIFF, and can confirm the raves for Renee Zellweger's performance as Judy Garland -- it definitely is one of the year's best. But I had problems with the film overall. There's just too much left out to make for a legitimate biopic.The biggest omission: daughter Liza Minelli. At the time depicted in this movie, she was 23, already making movies, and on a career trajectory that would result in an Oscar three years later (before her career admittedly went off a cliff). But here she pretty much doesn't exist - only Garland's two later children do.And when you reflect upon it, there's a lot more missing in this film. It also treats the period between Garland's Wizard of Oz/Andy Hardy MGM days and her final gig doing a London stage show in 1969 as a big blank, even though there were successes along the way well into the 60's, including two Oscar nominations and a Grammy award for Album of the Year. (Also a short-lived television show where she did a memorable duet with a 21-year-old Barbara Streisand.) Considering the range of celebrities she worked with, the opportunities for quality namedropping are limitless - but aside from Mickey Rooney, there's a pronounced lack of itThere are problems with inclusion as well. In real life, Garland had so many gay admirers that she gave rise to the ""FOD"" (Friends of Dorothy) acronym as slang for gays. In the movie, this angle is treated in very shorthand fashion by two completely fictional gay admirers of her London shows.The film reminded me a lot of JACKIE from 2016, where Natalie Portman played Jackie Kennedy. Her performance was certainly Oscar-worthy -- and she did get nominated - but I had problems with the presentation, particularly how Kennedy's funeral was depicted as a national day of mourning. Zellweger is similarly a nomination lock riding in a flawed vehicle.",Judy

239,dhunjiwadia,Turns out to be a pity story instead of a celebration,6,7 February 2020,"Instead of being a celebration of a legendary performer the film turns out to be a pity story. We see a Hollywood legend's waning years - so it isn't covering Judy Garland's entire life. Is everything shown on the screen an accurate depiction of her life? I haven't the faintest idea. But in real life she had so many gay admirers and she gave rise to Friends of Dorothy (FOD) acronym as slang for gays. This is treated in a very shorthand fashion with two gay admirers of her London shows.
Renee Zellweger is absolutely stunning and almost unrecognizable in the title role. Few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy Garland, but Zellweger admirably brings the pain and strain to the songs, which she sings herself. There will never be another Judy Garland, but this role allows Renee Zellweger to give a career-defining performance.",Judy

I just mean that I don't specifically seek out RZ movies as fan or anything. If you tell me that she's the lead, I feel neutral.After seeing this, I think I'm a fan, because she blew me away. Whenever really famous actors play really famous real-life figures, I usually find it distracting. It's even worse if they go so far as to wear facial prosthetics or fake teeth or something. That's just a distraction. Renee didn't have any special effects makeup. She just embodied Judy Garland in her body language, expressions, onstage personality, and spirit. Bravo!",Judy
242,tomfeller,Story of the last year of Judy Garland's life,9,8 November 2019,"I can remember watching The Wizard of Oz on television once a year when I was a boy, so I have been acquainted with Judy Garland (Renee Zellweger, who did her own singing, and Darci Hall in flashbacks) for almost all my life. I don't recall ever reading a biography about her, but I have watched at least one TV mini-series about her life. This movie focuses on the last year of her life before her premature death from a drug overdose at the age of 47. It starts by showing her reduced to accepting $150 for a live performance featuring her two younger children, Lorna (Bella Ramsey) and Joey Luft (Lewin Lloyd). (Liza Minnelli, played by Gemma-Leah Devereux, was an adult by this time and appears in one scene.) They live in hotels until Garland gets so far behind in their rent that she is forced to apply for help from her second husband Sid Luft (Rufus Sewell), who is fighting for custody of Lorna and Joey. One of the issues, which the film shows repeatedly, is Garland's alcoholism and addiction to amphetamines and barbiturates. Judy and Sid come to a temporary accord when she travels to London for a five week engagement at the cabaret-restaurant Talk of the Town while the children live with him. Most of the film concerns her time in London with a few flashbacks to the time when she was filming The Wizard of Oz. During the last year of her life, she met and married her fifth and last husband Mickey Deans (Finn Whitrock), who later wrote a book about their brief time together.
While Garland was in London, she was looked after by Rosalyn Wilder (Jessie Buckley), a long-time employee of the club, where the audience was known for throwing breadsticks at performers who displeased them. Wilder is still alive and served as a consultant on the film, talking to Zellweger, Buckley, the film's production designer, and its costumer. She also provided a tape recording by Deans of one of Garland's performances that the club had confiscated. The film took a few liberties with what actually happened. For instance, a scene in which Wilder had to visit Garland's hotel room to help her dress for her performance never happened. On the whole, Wilder has said that the film is a good representation of the time. On the other hand, none of Garland's children were involved with the film, although the filmmaker did read Lorna's book about her mother. Liza posted on Facebook that she neither approved nor sanctioned the movie.
Zellweger is excellent, as usual, and there is speculation that her performance will earn her a fourth Oscar nomination. (She won for Cold Mountain.) Before filming began, she trained for one year with a voice coach and then for four months with the film's musical director. She is three years older than Garland was at the time this film is set. The make-up artist extended her nose slightly to match Garland's, and she wore contact lenses to march Garland's eye color and a wig. Two of the best performances are provided by Andy Nyman and John Dagleish as a fictional gay couple who invite Garland to their apartment for a late dinner after one of her performances. One of the funniest scenes in the movie takes place when neither of them can figure out how to make an omelette. Overall, I would say that this is an excellent movie, although I can't vouch for its accuracy.",Judy
243,bgoo-19890,Renee Zellweger IS judy Garland,10,28 June 2020,Ms Zellwengeer deserves more than a nomination for this movie.

Zellweger delivers with flying colors but the film is lackluster overall. It's disappointing to see such a great performance dulled by a poor script and terrible casting.

246,mbruce007,Judy's not in Kansas any more...,8,1 December 2020,"It's amazing how time can change a person. When I recently saw Renée Zellweger's interview with Lorraine Kelly on ITV1, I was amazed how she had very much matured as a person and as an actress. In my view, she can no longer be associated with the ditsy Marilyn Monroe-esque parts that she played years ago in Chicago (2002) and Down With Love (2003). Nor, do I think, would she longer be quite right for the role which made her a household name, the romantically afflicted Bridget Jones.it's public knowledge that Zellweger took a substantial break from acting for personal reasons. And the decision to take this sabbatical is very much to her credit as she comes back refreshed and wonderfully uncanny in the part of Judy Garland in this year's hotly anticipated biopic directed by Rupert Goold, known principally for his work in English theatre. Having seen Lorraine Kelly's interview with Zellweger after the film, I observed that she still appeared to be articulating the idiosyncrasies of Judy which she pulls off so well in the film. So perhaps, if Zellwgger did indeed make some spiritual connection with her alter go in her research for the part, it seems clear that the spirit of Judy, powerful as it seems, has not yet left her...The film begins slap bang in the swinging 60s with a world weary Garland and her two young kids travelling around as she tries to make what money she can performing different theatre shows in America. Facing great financial difficulties, she makes the heartbreaking decision to leave her children with their financially stable but stony father, Sidney (the always understated Rufus Sewell) and accept the offer of a season in London at the famous Talk Of The Town theatre under the direction of renowned British theatre impresario, Bernard Delfont (the ever faithful Michael Gambon) and his associate, Rosalyn (the brilliant rising star, Jessie Buckley, recently acclaimed in Wild Rose).Arriving in London, the prescription drug-addled Judy struggles to keep it together, nearly missing her premiere performance completely, and thereafter turning up late and often incoherent to performances, to the disappointment of Belfont, and the horror of uncomprehending audience members (who, on one occasion, throw things at her on stage as if she were some pilloried criminal and not the beloved star of The Wizard Of Oz). Speaking of which, the film is cleverly peppered with flashbacks to her adolescence in which she was insidiously groomed by studio staff for her role in the classic film, suffering emotional blackmail at the hands of the imposing studio boss, Louis B. Mayer (a small but brilliant performance by Richard Cordery) and given countless pills instead of food to supposedly ""keep her weight down"" for the role, setting her lifelong addiction in motion.Amongst the bleakness, there are true moments of joy, such as when Judy sings on stage (Zellweger's actual voice, which can be both powerful and velvety, and can be heard anew on the film's soundtrack) and her courtship with her eventual second husband, the hip, young, Mickey (Finn Wittrock). Though Judy's was a largely sad life, the love for her children is clearly what gave her strength and purpose in later life, even while she was fighting back the tears. As she aptly says before performing her beloved standard, ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"", ""This is a song about hope. And we all need that"".",Judy

It would be a travesty if she was overlooked for the Oscar she portrays Judy Garland warts and all. The film also highlights how the Movie studios treated its stars. which inevitably is a lot of the issues that Judy Garland went through and no doubt did many others.

I've always been a fan of Renee Zellweger, she seems to just personify who she is playing, and in Judy there is no exception, Renee becomes Judy.The story mostly takes place in 1969, in the final few months of Judy Garland's life, and the period she spent in London performing at Talk of the Town in order to make money and resurrect her career which by that time was definitely going down the toilet. The Judy we see isn't the Dorothy Gayle image many of us have of her, but of a broken woman in her late 40s whose past haunts her. Addicted to various drugs to sleep, stay awake, stay slim etc. since her early career at MGM.The story of her final few months is presented both quite tragically, but also very warmly and with some very funny moments. I'm not sure how true to reality the film plot actually is, but I'd like to think that the real Judy had a few wild times in London.The end of the film, which I won't spoil, although we all know what happened to Judy, is handled perfectly and respectfully.All performances are very good, and Renee Zellweger as mentioned is outstanding - she looks like Judy, has the mannerisms, and although she recorded her own vocals for the songs, she does bring a voice incredibly similar to the real deal.By the end of the film there were more than a few tears and sniffles from the cinema audience, including my own!

Renee Zellwegger should be commended for finding the essence of Judy and using it. There are moments where she (under a few lbs of makeup tricks and prosthetics) looks uncannily like her, capturing her twitchy body language beautifully. Every now and then, she even sounds like her a bit when her native Texas accent doesn't accidentally slip in. I'm sure we've all heard far better superficial Garland impressions vocally, but what many of them fail to do is capture her essence which Zellwegger does with seeming ease.As excellent as Zellwegger is, Judy itself lets her down a bit with a pretty dour story about the last year of Garland's life, spruced up by the occasional MGM studio flashback (many of which don't add much to the film). It's not a very memorable film at all, which is a true shame, because a performance as good as Zellwegger's deserves a better vehicle.

The movie is all about Judy Garland when she is in her 40's. We all known Judy as the sweet Dorothy from the Wizard Of Oz. Someone who got whisked off by a tornado. Well metaphorically speaking, that tornado was already whirling Judy around before she got that part. We see small snippets during the movie of young Judy (played by Darci Shaw), and the struggles that are put upon her while shooting the movie we all know and love. The control and torture that was bestowed onto her of not eating and drugs to take away the need to eat. She was encouraged as a child to lose weight, as ""she isn't the prettiest, not got nice teeth and her nose was too big at the bridge"", but she had the ""voice"". In the movie, we see Judy's childhood tortures on the face and in the persona of the adult Judy (played by Renee Zellweger). We see that she has been drained of her money and what we all perceived to be the Hollywood lifestyle of a childhood actress. She is given the lifeline of shows in London, which she has to take so she could be the mother she wants to be to her 2 youngest children. The story is heartbreaking to see, but Renee Zellweger plays the part absolutely amazingly. I was surprised how well she was able to copy the traits of singing in the way Judy did. I also think that Jessie Buckley played a very good part as the London show's assistant Rosalyn Wilder. I can definitely see why Renee Zellweger not only won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA, but also the Oscar for Best Leading Actress for this performance.",Judy

Renee, though also not the kindest to her fans, delivered perhaps the role of her lifetime. Judy is thoughtfully not only kind, but apathetic to her gay fans, testimony to her being an icon 50 years after her passing - a very good selling pint to seeing this film... Clearly the filmmakers would have had to pay a steep price to actually use Judy's voice, ( a primary reason Liza tried to dissuade fans not to see this film ,) knowing Liza from the times I met her, her ""what can you give me , or you can't have that"" attitude --
it is Renee's character which was a good reason to let Renee sing to illustrate at various times later in her life, adding character to Judy's condition at the time, a valid & successful movie decision here.
Nominations to follow, No one should imply an Oscar win, just to be nominated is good enough recognition, as winners are not always projected correctly nor should they.

It's a weepy, downbeat, and joyless film to watch as we see legend Judy Garland suffer one career and personal low after another with precious levity in between.Zellweger commits admirably and even does her own singing in the role, but it never feels like a natural fit and the script does her no favors - flashing back to her days on the MGM lot whenever it feels froggy. Garland, in this film, seems like a miserable person to be around and, for someone unfamiliar with her work, it's hard to tell why she was ever considered such a legend to begin with. We see none of that flair and humor and vulnerability that made her such a shining star to begin with.

Her finances are in shambles, her confidence - never a strong suit - is very low. Her minder is doing her best to keep Judy on task, not easy when Judy is often too drunk to be on time, or too tormented with fear of facing the audience.When she arrives on stage drunk, beginning to sing 'San Francisco,' then falling on her face - literally - causing the audience to mock her and and throw things at her...

Great juxtaposition, meant to give insight into how the end of her life came to be-- Garland died from an accidental overdose of pills but was essentially living on borrowed time, having ""worn out"" her body with hard living/addictions/mental health depressions/etc.Renee sings, not dubbed. Wonderfully complex and Oscar worthy performance by R.The film is a little long in part because lots of songs --but well worth the slow wait as it deepens the character depiction and her love/hate with the role of being on stage. No amount of knowing the factual details of her life compares to seeing the onscreen magic of her personality-- and evolution.As one other reviewer wrote, the probably artificial relationship of Judy with two fans was a terrific way to show her spirit, her compassion and her appreciation of her public.Lastly, from Wikipedia, ""After Garland's body had been embalmed by Desmond Henley, Deans traveled with her remains to New York City on June 26, where an estimated 20,000 people lined up to pay their respects at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel in Manhattan, which remained open all night long to accommodate the overflowing crowd.""",Judy

With this type of movie I personally need less of the feeling that it's all staged. It did not feel real to me. I did really like the general atmosphere, the clothes, the furniture and everything else that makes you feel like you've gone back in time. It was beautiful to look at.",Judy
283,CinePete,Closing Nights,8,27 October 2019,"Renee Zellweger gives a show-stopping performance as Judy Garland. It takes me back to Marion Cotillard's work as Edith Piaf in La Vie En Rose -- and another Best Actress Oscar seems imminent here.Renee's depiction of Judy has practically every trait we associate with the legendary star. Just when we think her resources have been exhausted, another small gesture or nuance uncovers the volatile, tormented Judy and the tortured addiction that now threatens the closing nights of her career.Judy may really be a story about a mother trying to reclaim her children. It is 1968, and Joey & Lorna Luft are in custody of an unflinching ex-husband. Garland is desperate for money to pay off debts, and regain some degree of authority over her family.Her determination to complete a 5-week engagement at Talk of the Town in London is the pushing drive of the movie. For the sake of the children, and the recovery of her own motherhood, Judy pushes herself to the very limits.It makes for a rather exhausting movie. The film is strictly without humor or any kind of relief. Judy is scrutinized with a kind of merciless gaze by the camera, often in close shot, clinging to every passionate word and agonized expression. All this arguably becomes a bit too intense for a two hour movie.And the film does not adequately fill out the side stories. We don't really get more than a cursory glance at Liza, or at husband #5 (Finn Wittrock), and not quite enough of the early Judy (well played by Darci Shaw) in flashbacks to MGM studios in 1939.But the film belongs to Renee from first to last. By the very end, when Judy does an ""Over the Rainbow"" number (the one we've been waiting for), it all seems to come from an unattainable dreamland far away. Yes, there is a dangerous tilt towards maudlin feel-good stuff at this final point, but Renee reminds us that there was, for fleeting moments anyway, real dream-magic at the core of Judy's legend.",Judy

287,jeffreyoliverrock,"Great Performances and Scenery, but Feels Unfinished",5,11 October 2019,"I'll say first and foremost that Renee Zellweger does an amazing job! As well as the other actors/actresses. The sets are nice, and it does capture the time period very well. I will say also that this movie was different than what I was expecting. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it always depends on how so.Okay, now, I am (presently) 26 years old, my father wasn't even born when Judy was around. I discovered her, like most kids, through the Wizard of Oz, and learned about her career as I got older. I am not a Judy Garland expert by any means (Judy's the only one who truly could be anyway), but I was interested in her story enough to read about and watch documentaries on her, and of course, to see this movie.The movie mostly takes place in the late 60's during one of Judy's last tours, and occasionally goes back to her as a child. I liked that they showed how strict and cruel the movie companies were to her, and how important it was for their actors to be ""perfect"". I also thought the chemistry with young Judy and Mickey Rooney was nice. As an adult, the struggles she faced being in debt and still turning to the drugs were portrayed nicely. But everything Judy did in between her child years and this run of shows is almost totally skipped.Very little is mentioned about other movies besides the Wizard of Oz, nothing is mentioned about Judy's albums, or the TV show she had for a short time. I liked that Judy befriends a gay couple in the film, but her being an icon in the gay community still felt a little missed. While Judy's family and kids are talked about, they don't have a lot of screen time, at least not as much as I would have thought. I don't recall her sisters being in the movie at all. The film seems to only show Judy at her most troubling time, and misses what she achieved as an actress, a singer, a mother, and a woman.I think what bothered me most was when the song ""Over the Rainbow"" appears. The song isn't even performed in it's entirety... or entirely by Judy.And I'll just say it, I thought the way it ended was terrible, it felt so unfinished. I'm not saying it should have followed to her death, but I definitely wish it would have carried on five or ten more minutes to bring a little closure to events that happened a few scenes before the end.Overall, I think it could have been done better, but I suppose it could have been worse. My stars are for the cast on this one. Just my opinion of course.",Judy

289,mwpowelllde,Realistic portrayal of a tragic young talent,8,17 January 2020,"From somewhere over the rainbow to a storied redemption and a tragic life lost. Somewhere along the way I'd heard that Judy Garland was pretty much doped out of her mind whenever she performed, and this film does a pretty decent job at capturing that issue, from her early childhood, through to her last months with us on Earth. I also concur with so many of the comments, it is not often you find a subject so well matched to the performer, and vice versa, but in this we have exactly that with Renée Zellweger's portrayal of Frances Ethel Gumm AKA Judy Garland. Her younger self is portrayed by Darci Shaw, who also does fine work in her supporting role. The film also does a fairly good job exposing just how rampant the child slavery, borderline sex in this case, trade really is, Hollywood being one of the industry's chief protagonists, mind you. Not for the faint of heart, but it is also not grotesquely unwholesome subject matter, either. Would definitely accompany younger viewers with the more mature material.",Judy

296,jeroboam-26661,Great performance by Zellweger but so-so movie.,6,16 February 2020,"This movie was about a Hollywood tragedy, a sad story about a woman who was exploited her whole by the entertainment industry. Renee Zellweger really captures the spirit of Judy Garland and turns in a grande performance but the movie is pretty much all about her performance to the point of being overly ambitious when it comes to her musical numbers. As a performance piece by an actor it's impressive but it's distracting to the movie because it's not nearly the same level as Judy and it's hard to believe the audience was so enthusiastic for such an undistinguished singing voice.
I also think that Zellweger's makeup looked way too extreme to the point where she looked plastic. I can't imagine Judy Garland looking like that all the time but it definitely did not look good in the film. She looked well older than 47, the age that Judy lived before she passed.I was hoping to see more of Judy's life depicted in the movie. To someone who didn't know much about Judy before seeing this film I don't think it would have made much sense. Also it acted as a teaser for someone like me who wanted to know more about the rest of her life. This is a decent film worth a watch for Renee Zellweger's Oscar performance. 6.5/10",Judy

Renée Zellweger's excellent performance aside, the rest of the movie is very weak with bland performances. The script is very lazy as this only concentrated on the last leg of Judy's stage performances in London with 'The Talk of The Town'.
The glory years are completely absent. There is nothing about her casting in Easter Parade or A Star is Born. It does show anything of her 4 marriage breakdowns. We see her already divorced from her 4th husband.
The film also only shows tiny inserts of her on The Wizard of Oz set and how she was emotionally abused but it never delves too deep into this. These sciences are also very heavy handed with a miscast performance from a young Judy. Worst all all, the film never gets under the skin of this legendary performer that we all wanted.",Judy
302,dmaboyer,One of the worst,1,5 October 2019,"One of the worst movies I have seen in a while. It is long, it is boring and it is depressing. Renee neither looks nor sounds like Judy.

I only way you could tell the Liza character was Liza was the haircut. Renee has done some good acting in other movies but this was not one of them. She just looked like an actress trying to do a poor imitation of Judy.",Judy
303,TorontoFilmFan,A film tribute,6,18 July 2020,"The film makers of JUDY seem to want it both ways. On one level it is the hackneyed, re-telling of the downward slide of a once famous star, now broke, self-destructive, and on a one-way trajectory to oblivion. Not exactly interesting or enjoyable to watch. On a different note, JUDY is constructed as a film tribute to the indomitable spirit of a unique talent and major entertainer, Judy Garland. Though much damaged in her youth by movie biz types, Garland was able to connect with her fans on a seemingly preternatural level. Regrettably the script doesn't deliver much on either account and we get a pastiche of everything: scenes with Louis B Meyer, drug addiction, insomnia, financial ruin, divorce, custody battles, parenting distress, stage fright, adoring fans and ignominy, alcoholism, new love, another divorce, and of course the highs of a top performer who can still deliver even when the chips are down (well, most of the time). But in this edited version of Ms Garland's life, the chips are mostly down. The film drags in too many scenes rehashing the same tragic tropes. Or delivers it's melodrama seemingly lifted out of an afternoon soap opera.
But what we also get with this movie is a performance by Renee Zellweger that - much like Judy Garland herself - survives this movie altogether. In fact, she walks away with the movie. While much has been made of Ms Zellweger's grimmances and smirks in rendering the character, it must be said that while she doesn't look or sound like Judy, most noticeably in the musical numbers, her performance of the character is completely captivating and lovely. What the script fails to deliver, Zellweger more than makes up for it by the sheer daring of her performance. (Not since Meryl Streep in Iron Lady have we seen this combo of poor script and a weak biographical movie, elevated by a star-turning performance at its centre). A better film would have been nice, but fans can take comfort knowing that JUDY helps ensure we won't forget Judy Garland.",Judy

Half an hour later, had I been on my own, I would have probably left; but we stuck it out. A lot of problems arose wondering what was fact and what was 'artistic' licence.

Such is the scale of her performance that it leaves you teary eyed.She is definitely winning the OSCAR without any second thoughts and has set a benchmark in stagecraft that is not going to be beaten anytime soon atleast in the near future.The film's screenplay is adapted from the Peter Quilter's musical - ""End of the rainbow"" which depicts Judy Garland's life leading up to her Death in 1969 and does complete justice to the memory and stardom of one of the most popular artists of the 20th century.This film will go down in history as the revelation of Renée Zellweger's stardom.She is an absolute gem of an actor.Outstanding!",Judy

As much as I wanted to love the movie, I think it was a poor choice centering a film around the last year of Judy Garland's life when she had accomplished so much. Yes, the bulk of her life was filled with sad events but why does Hollywood want us to be entertained by her ultimately lowest point in life.I grew up watching Judy Garland's movies with my grandmother & reading biographies about her.

316,adsitm,Beautiful,9,3 October 2019,"A powerhouse and immersive performance by Renée Zellweger anchors the narrative about the tragic and beautiful last months of the Golden Age of Hollywood legend Judy Garland's life in late 1968. The film is powerful and the song numbers are spot on. A very moving work. Her formative years locked in an odious contract and how it may have lead to her demons are showcased by a nice actress; and this is not a distraction, but essential to filling in the complete story of who she was.",Judy

318,frankdistefano,Incisive and Heartbreaking,10,30 September 2019,"Let's get this out of the way. Renee Zellweger is sensational portraying Judy Garland, even though it's her voice and not Garland singing. Yes, I'm a huge admirer of Garland, one of the lucky few that attended her Carnegie Hall concert in 1961 and to see anyone attempt to capture her magic seemed impossible. Well, Zellweger did! The movie is unflinching in portraying Garland's immense talent and frustrating - for both herself and her audience - self-destruction. That Garland gave so much of herself while wrestling with so many demons, especially from MGM and Louis B. Mayer in her early career, has been brought to the screen with sensitivity and honesty. Not an easy film to watch but fascinating and intriguing. A movie with few punches pulled, leaving the audience enthralled.",Judy

322,cleio14,A beautiful tragedy ...,10,8 April 2020,"Judy is an outstanding film about Ms. Garland, depicting how the exploitative abusiveness of talented women & girls by powerful men in Hollywood continues to wreak havoc on their lives and this life in particular. The psychological and physical abuse of forcing a young girl & woman to take medications to manage weight and performance; telling her she is worthless unless she obeys; the lack of sleep, the constant monitoring of food & the restrictive diet all as a means of control; not even a allowed a few real moments of adolescence - only manufactured dates & birthdays to further the studio's profits, only to then be dismissed, discarded, & ridiculed for the inevitable aging & mental health issues, and when those in power can no longer profit from her in the way they want. The film is raw and painful. Renee Zellwegger is tremendous, embodying such a range of human experience, from fragility to ferocity. This film is a testament to the strength of creative, talented women who persevere the best they can with what cards they are allowed to play in a patriarchal system. I'll never again be able to watch the Wizard of Oz the same way knowing the prices the women were paying to make the film. Judy is one of the best, most powerful films I've seen in a long time.",Judy

Although the film is an accurate adaptation, it struggles with pacing. Renée Zellweger saves the film with her performance as Garland. There are certain facial expressions and mannerisms of Judy's that Renée captured so well. Even the stage performances throughout the film are incredibly accurate. Renée certainly did her homework. The ending is touching, but still doesn't quite make up for the poor structure. Judy is worth a watch, but only once or twice.",Judy

328,steve-83-602015,Judy The Film Reviewed by a Black Man,6,8 October 2019,"The screenplay did not build, there was no vertical lift. I also question opening the Zellweger vehicle with a close-up on Darci Shaw who played Young Judy.The casting was very good.There was no cross-cultural appeal with this movie. I went to see the movie because I was born in 1962-still a child in 1968 when the film takes place-and I love great singers. I enjoyed her movies as a child. I loved her torch songs. I own a CD of her April 23rd, 1961 Carnegie Hall performance. I do not see this movie appealing to people much younger than myself. I do not think the film had cross-cultural appeal, but the band director did have an afro. (And the band did sound good and with the right song, energizing.)I would not be surprised if the film earns award nominations for costume design or make-up.I would be surprise if it did not earn award nominations for acting. Renée Zellweger was a 10 for acting and a 9 for singing. Roles of other actors were not substantial for rising to nominations for supporting male/female actor.
With strong production design, set design, and cinematography, the screenplay lowered the score of Scenes from 4 out of 5 to 3 out of 5.I did not find the movie tasteful, appropriate, or meaningful. Yes, part of Judy Garland's biography did lack taste, with the drugs from a young age, the alcohol, dysfunction, career and life pressures. They were on display but I did not find the time span of her life chosen appropriate for a film. Her powers as a performing artist were dying and she / died six months after the point where the film ends. (Light bulb.) Did the film need two or three original footage videos or audio clips, from Judy's greatest triumphs, not Renée but Judy, singing, performing?The quality of production was very good. The directing and editing were good. The artistic value was better than good, given the subject of the film, the production design, the acting, cinematography, and more; but, the impact it had on me was just average.It is not a position of strength to sell a movie as a Renée Zellweger vehicle (I still have not seen the 1992 film Chaplin, starring Robert Downing, Jr.)-Renée Zellweger as Judy Garland-and then in so many flashbacks, having Darci Shaw playing the young Judy Garland, a role unsubstantial for a supporting actress nod. And, with cross-cultural appeal lacking, mentioned earlier, marketing must suffer.I do not think this film was a good movie experience value. I was entertained by its strengths. Personally? I had to go to the movies. Maybe, in some way, I am like her two die-hard fans in the film.I give this film 66 points, 6 out of 10 stars, 3 out of 5 stars.Thank you.",Judy

330,johnhandsome-32658,Zellweger gives best performance in years,9,28 September 2019,"With Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland, you can not only feel her and see her, but you forget Zellweger is even there at all. Like many great performances, you see the character and forget that there is even an actor. Watching her performance is like watching a cosmic display. Some things are just meant to happen.There have been many so-so bio-pics as of late, most comparably Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool, in which another great actress, Benning, portrays the troubled last days of another great actress, Graham. Comparably, Zellweger's performance outshines the more renowned Benning. By contrast, Liverpool is also jaggedly uneven. That's not to say that Judy is perfect. Music bios are tough. Rami supposedly was great in Bohemian Rhapsody, but the film encompassed a superficial sentiment and lacked intellectual curiosity. Control, the Joy Division piece, is maybe the best in recent years... But Judy is right up there.The story covers her last gig in London. The film uses flashbacks in order for the audience to understand her character. While most of those around her only see a washed up star, who was just forty seven.What the story lacks in structure, it makes up with warmth. While this is a softer portrait, it still feels authentic. It finds no purpose in portraying her issues with callousness. Instead the narrative depends on Garland trying to understand herself, while making poor choice after poor choice. If you know anything about Garland, you know where she is going... But what you may not know, is she how she arrived there. It is a deeply sentimental portrait of a brilliant mind and troubled heart.There have been some cynics saying that ""Only a fool would try to play Garland."" Dare, I say, Zellweger just made a fool out of you.See this movie, it will remind you of yourself.",Judy
331,Areneewatson,Very interesting and intriguing,8,8 January 2021,This movie was like watching a biography told through the lens of someone else (someone who perhaps writes biographies so someone has taken the liberty to fill in the blanks) but very interesting all the same. You don't get the impression that you are watching the movie through her point of view though they tried to make it seem that way. I don't think she would enjoy this particular point of view however Renee zellweger was fabulous in this movie. It was definitely worth watching for sure and I absolutely positively loved it!! It's a movie that I would rewatch time and time again!,Judy
332,kas823,Hard to watch at times... and timely,9,14 October 2019,"Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job portraying Judy Garland in her last, most lonely and difficult years.

334,obrienigm,"Great Acting, Singing? Not so much.",6,20 December 2019,"This is an engaging film, it is sympathetic to Garland, while not shying away from her well documented flaws. My main problem was allowing Zellweger to sing the songs. She is no Judy Garland. Nobody is. So you miss the whole point of what made Judy so loved. That incrediblly heartbreaking pure voice. If they had dubbed it, and Zelleweger had spent the same effort learning to mime as she did to learn the songs the concert footage wood have blown the bloody doors off. Instead you sit there thinking 'i rather hear Judy's version'. Look at bohemian rhapsody. Rami Malek is fantastic, but crucially you also get to hear Freddie Mercurys great vocals. Anyway still a good film well worth watching.",Judy

However, the movie itself is just a straight line. Usually in films like this, it shows how they started and the middle and the end with the character discovering something. In this film it does flashback to Oz and some basics, but it really just shows the last months/year of Judy's life. The character does not really evolve for a natural ending. It just sort of ended.

first, the movie makes it very difficult to like her character (as amazing as judy garland was). i know this is supposed to be about her tragic decline before her untimely death, but they did not touch on the soul of judy garland at all... there was no effort to make her an endearing character, through either timeline.
and zellweger's cringeworthy over-performance... really hard to swallow. she also has these twitchy, convulsing movements when she sings. i tried to look passed it and even decided to look up several of garland's performances to see if these mannerisms originally belonged to her... they did not. judy garland is a blessing to watch; zellweger's homage, not so much.",Judy

344,zuzuspetals927,Over the Rainbow was Never Enough,8,5 April 2021,"I skimmed through the many reviews posted of this film. Some are spot on and some invariably miss the mark. Why post to complain? Why post to make note of the artistic license taken? Why post to offer up other biopics of Judy Garland or the thousands of books written about her? What purpose does that serve? And what difference does it make? Comparisons are exercises in facile futility.Watching Renee zellweger's performance offered for me, a glimpse into the last year of this woman's life. She was 47 years old when she died. Broke. All that money squandered by those that took and abused that power. If you're looking for the bright, shiny, happy film, this is not it. She was not able to sleep without pills. An alcoholic. But committed to her children, which is why she did the London gigs, at least if the film got that part of the story right. Some say that the years of forced diet and diet pills created an eating disorder that stayed with her for the rest of her life. She took one bite of the birthday cake towards the end and could barely swallow. It was painful to watch.While it is unfortunate that Liza Minnelli did not give her blessing for ""Judy"", it marched on without her. Renee poured her heart and soul into this role, and you can see all her hard work in trying to capture this woman's spirit, fortitude and talent, a monstrous and thankless task. She deserved that Oscar, hands down.The ending left me speechless. ""Over the Rainbow"", is without question, one of my favorite songs of all-time. As I understand it, Judy knew the first time she heard the song that this would be ""her song"" that she would sing for the rest of her life. As I also understand it, in the Wizard of Oz, there was a deleted scene in which she sang the song a second time. Those that witnessed it, as I understand it, wept like babies. It foreshadows everything that was not to come in this woman's life.Would Judy have been pleased? Who knows. But in the end, as she so sadly begged, ""please don't forget me."" For this girl, she never will be.",Judy

It doesn't work. Instead, it feels like a mockery. Renee Zellweger does not have an ounce of the stage presence, the dancing style, and powerful presence, let alone the voice, of the original Judy. Why bother? Why not just watch the real Judy Garland on YouTube, or in one of her old movies?The only reason to give this movie any stars is the story itself, which tries to show how difficult her life was as a result of being such a huge star, starting from such an early age. But Renee Zellweger's acting ruins even the feeling of sympathy I should be feeling. Just awful.",Judy

Throughout the years I've probably watched ""The wizard of Oz"" more than a hundred times and read everything I could find about Judy. So of course I wanted to watch this film.However when I heard Renee Zellweger was to portray Judy, I was not thrilled. I only knew her from Bridget Jones, and thought her to be a quite shallow actress. How wrong I was! Renee portrays Judy with a lot of tenderness, melancholy and humour.The set-up of the story is quite typical for a biographical film, but it works well, the strength of it however is in the smaller moments. A big theme is friendship, and the portrayal of it in this film really moved me. Moreoever, the photography and coloring was beautiful and felt well thought out, especially in the ""young Judy""-scenes, with the clarity only Hollywood can give.I truly recommend this film to all Judy Garland fans, and to anyone who wants to see a moving biopic about a most human and brilliant woman.",Judy

These reviewers assume that the audience knows well the struggle Judy Garland had in her early life and that they know all of her career. There also seems to be a desire that the director and script shy away from the truth of the last year of her life.That being said, I felt that flashbacks were particularly important in highlighting her life and were selected to lead into the next scene of her current state. Without these scenes, Judy Garland's current state would be very hard for the audience to get behind. It would make the end unjustified and meaningless even if it's real life.What I appreciate is that they chose not to assume the audience knew much about her experiences or her end of life and chose to show it all, the good, bad, the drugged. In the end, the choices in the story-telling made the film feel three dimensional and tangible. Lastly, Renee Zellweger was dead on in her performance.

The woman was not entirely a showbiz martyr, but she was a one of a kind talent, devoted to those who loved her, friend, family and fan alike-- at least as devoted as she could be, and not deserving of mud-throwing anymore. It's been fifty years since she died for heaven's sake.So, no: there is nothing new or revelatory to learn about Garland in this film, which is fine. What else to we need to know? It's a competently written, gorgeously produced film. As for Zellweger, she's actually even more impressive than I thought she'd be. And no, the singing isn't Judy, but she does a more than credible job with it, and sounds leagues better than she did in CHICAGO.

There is no plot, no one to root for, and nothing to look forward to. It's just one sad scene after another. I was hoping for a biopic from start to finish; instead, it's centered almost entirely around Judy's final years, when she was constantly drunk and/or drugged up, homeless, bombing at shows, her being rude to everyone, and everyone being rude to her in return.Occasionally there's a flashback to her childhood, but those are also difficult to watch because she's constantly having diet pills shoved down her throat and being bossed around on set. My wife said it was probably the most depressing movie she's ever seen. I don't mind depressing films, as long as there's a hero to root for and it has a plot, or even a message. This movie has none of that. Even films where the ""bad guy"" is the main character give you someone to care about because you understand what their intentions are, and their passion keeps you interested. This movie just made me dislike Judy Garland, and that makes me sad to say because I've always been a big fan of hers.I understand that most of the film is based on fact. I've read two biographies about her, and I spent most of the film thinking ""Yep, that's what happened."" But again, the problem is that there's no story. I had no idea what the character Judy's goal was, or what the movie was even about. It was just two hours of watching this nasty woman bomb onstage while her agents chastise her, and then after a somewhat touching scene between Judy and the audience, it just ends randomly with subtitles about her death. I thought that final scene failed because by that point I couldn't care less about the character and I just wanted the movie to end. I say this as a Judy Garland fan - read a book about her life instead wasting your time on this stupid movie.",Judy

The whole cast of Judy is great and the performances are exquisite, but Renée Zellweger made history with this movie as she embodies a star that was thought to struggle from a very early age. Her acting is to perfection, this role offered her a great opportunity and she ran with it. One if not the incarnation of her carrier so far.",Judy

I kept seeing Bridget Jones peeking out and the singing was great, BUT... not Judy. She obviously dubbed herself, why not dub Judy's voice at least? She was a powerhouse, Renee isn't.Since Zellweger was able to adopt a passable British voice, why not try harder to get Judy's lower register? That's all I'm saying.",Judy

376,charingkam,Well-balanced with a spectacular performance from Renee Zellweger,8,9 January 2020,"Renee Zellweger stuns in this Judy Garland biopic, making the over-acting part of the intense experience, and making her impossible to look away from.The humanity behind the legend is showcased phenomenally, with the film making most characters grey instead 'good vs bad'. It's also a stunning look at gaslighting and the Hollywood experience of child actors.",Judy
377,ashleybe03,This is truly Zellweger's greatest performance,8,5 January 2020,"That isn't an exaggeration. She truly captures the pain of Judy Garland and how she would still go out and put on a smile and an amazing performance on stage. While behind all of that she was in the throws of her addiction and she truly felt alone. The way Judy loved her children but couldn't really take care of them is so heartbreaking. She really only did the Talk of the Town show for them. To financially take care of them. I watched an interview and she was asked if she wouldn't have been an actress then what does she imagine she would have been. She answers with sadness, ""I would have been happily married."" Renée Zellweger captures that desperation of not wanting to be alone and all the pain she suffered as a child. The story lacks a defined path but with Zellweger giving you Judy Garland 100% your captured. Sad story of THE child actress who was used for every ounce she could give and woman who was damaged and then tossed away. Def Oscar worthy performance",Judy
378,ehuisman,Judy is all Zellweger and nothing else.,7,2 August 2020,"Don't slam the film Judy just because it chooses to not let the darker side of Judy Garland dominate the picture. It's a laudable touch to let the singer have the last word on stage, rather than the pain that she would eventually succumb to. The problem here is that Zellweger is so compelling, so captivating, that if you subtract her from your analysis, you end up with nothing. You can't help but wonder whether that was the whole point.",Judy

It was one of the common loves my mother and I both have.While watching this film it really did at times feel like I was seeing Judy. Renee Zellweger truly captures Judy's essence. I walked in most skeptical about the singing and while not the true glory of Judy's voice in her heyday, Renee was still able to emulate Judy's voice near the end of her life.I loved that the focus was always on Judy. Her mannerism, her style, and what she meant to others.",Judy
388,dcalaproductions,"""Judy"" - A Transcendent Performance Within A Middling Film",6,27 October 2019,"Thanks to a powerfully raw performance from Renee Zellweger, Judy works, for the most part, while not existing as a particularly transcendent biopic. Like most music docudramas before this such as ""Ray"" starring Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and ""Walk the Line"" with the chameleon Joaquin Phoenix as an in-his-prime Johnny Cash, this film follows a normal three-act, rise-and-fall narrative structure that, by this point, is mostly cookie-cutter. What is deeply missing from this one is a more expansive historical context. The movie hop-scotches around from Judy Garland in the movie's present day of the late 1960s where she is bottoming out and desperate to regain her showstopping glory days to flashbacks to young Judy on the set and starring in the landmark musical ""The Wizard of Oz"". While these callback sequences add additional emotional heft to Judy's lifelong plight, particularly her relationship with her domineering, neglectful and abusive mother, not enough time is spent developing Judy as a larger than life figure.Zellweger tries tirelessly to come within striking distance of the real Judy's memorable and skillful vocals but ultimately misses the mark each time despite her unwavering commitment to the part that will surely put her on the Academy's radar for Oscars next year. That being said, the period is lovingly and faithfully recreated with exceptional detail but many of the dialogue scenes involving the secondary supporting characters linger a little too much. At over two hours, some script tightening would have benefited the movie's pacing in order for it to be synthesized to the essentials of Judy's life and her colossal impact on the studio system of the time.Ultimately, Judy acts as a melodramatic cautionary tale for aspiring performers and working artists by illuminating the sheer amount of no holds barred sacrifice that is needed to even have a chance at a career. Zellweger's real life dysfunction from being failed by the Hollywood machine herself bleeds into her performance and gives it a truly lived-in authenticity that is something to see. It's just unfortunate that the movie surrounding her never quite matches.",Judy
389,josephochasteen,Excellent Timeframe Movie,8,31 December 2020,"I watched several hours of YouTube clips and documentaries and A&E's Biography about Judy the days before I watched this and it is amazing how Zellweger looks so much like her in some shots. Its amazing, and I love how they focused on one ""timeframe"" of her life and getting immersed in how it was dealing with her behind the scenes of her London (and other) shows. She will always be an interesting, intriguing, and tragic character in history and this film gives us an insight to that.
The one major flaw is Zellweger's singing. Its great but it does not sound like Judy at all (it sounds like Renee Zellweger singing strongly) Its almost like they should have used montages of Zellweger as Judy while actual recording ls were used, but I know its a Hollywood movie and thats not how its done. Her best sounding Judy is the part where she hangs out with the couple at their apartment and one is playing the piano while she casually starts singing. That part literally made me cry. Such a moving part.",Judy

This movie is NOT boring. In fact, is the opposite. There is very little dancing and lots of singing. I knew very little about Judy. Now, I'm a fan of both Judy and Renee. I think Renee has a chance of some sort of awards or nominations. Go see it. You'll love it!!",Judy

She well deserves all the awards and accolades she has and assuredly will receive.But the movie itself? Cruel.They found the right production company. Right before the movie begins you see the Calamity Films banner. In my opinion, that perfectly encapsulates this movie.Certainly people are still interested in Judy Garland. She is one of the most enduring stars of cinema, and a tragic ending often makes things more interesting.But why this movie that seeks to destroy her reputation? She was the subject of cruelty almost her entire life. What did she do in the afterlife that she deserves more cruelty by the very object of that cruelty -- Hollywood?And the length of the movie just turns the screws like a medieval torture machine.It's so trendy...But when all the idols have been smashed and the heroes deflated because of the hunger for reality, what will you have left?CGI comic book heroes.

It mainly shows Judy in her last year, concentrating on her final performances in London, plus some flash backs during her Wizard of Oz years.

First of all, she looked far too healthy. They should have aged her more. Judy did not look well the last year of her life and she looked twenty years older than she was. More importantly, though, I don't think Renée really transformed into a different person. She did a good job w/ the posture, but I wasn't wowed other than that.

Therefore I had not been dying to see this feature but it did grab my attention of course when Rene Zellweger won the Oscar for best female actress and after seeing this film I can see why .Judy is set during her 1968 Visit to London which like the Marilyn Monroe film; "" a week with Marilyn "" works very well as it doesn't leave that awful typical biopic pattern where they try to cramp too much into nothing. This on the other hand allows us to take our time with Judy enabling us to get to know the character and with the support of timely flashbacks it begins to help us understand Judy and her crazy life in Showbiz .Although the film is slow at times it is truly made up by how amazing Renee's performance is , a comeback of the ages.",Judy

416,amandahiltonj,It's all about Renee,8,12 October 2019,"To those familiar with the Garland story this is a well crafted film detailing the desperate acts of a failing film star. To those not, this has been done before.Cinematically it is well shot and has stylistic clues similar to Stan and Ollie. As both are BBC film productions looking back at last hurrahs in the UK perhaps this is where the likeness comes from.The music numbers are stand out elements and have your tissues ready for the end. Pacing is a little slow and the story is a bit thin. However as I allude to in the title there is one stand out reason to see this.Zellweger is simply excellent. When you forget almost immediately that you are watching a facsimile and accept the actress as the character then you allow yourself to become part of her story. That makes what you see that much more believable and the empathy and connection with the character increases.Awards will come her way no doubt. Good supporting characters complete the picture of the troubles she had at that time and the flashbacks add to the story not detract. The young Garland actress shines also. One poignant moment is an encounter with some fans. I wont spoil the moment but that and the end tug at the heart strings in a way that cinema should.I think the viewer benefits from a knowledge of the story and liking of the sound of that era but a powerful lead makes up for some grumbling about pace and story development to the uninitiated.I await the DVD release to play on my huge screen and singalong the soundtrack.",Judy

She was incredible of course and the movie was pretty decent as well, but in the end it could have been much better with a more effective screenplay.Maybe they should have spend more time to explore the beginning of Garlands career since the flashbacks were really the beat part of the movie, but all in all this was still a pretty decent film.",Judy

I have just flown back east from LA and did not read any reviews on JUDY.Of course, I know how incredible Judy Garland was in life...and danced and sang along to her tunes years later. She was a big deal in my
Big family (back then) and I always loved her!!this MOVIE was beyond anything I have seen in a while. From the writing to directing and editing....absolutely flawlessly done!I sat in the theatre seat for 20 minutes and weeped, not because, of all sadness, but to the memories she has left us through her incredible talent, how Hollywood stars were poorly treated and truthfully, it will be hard for me to watch my all time favorite of Wizard of Oz....it is my yearly Thanksgiving movie...it will be tough to get through.Renee Zellwegger, WOWEE!!!!!! I actually thought for a moment the rights were purchased to Garland's voice.....Unreal!!! Aren't you happy you decided to sing??? Incredible Oscar worthy performance.....Unforgettable!",Judy
439,lkeve,Very Sad but impressive movie,9,29 September 2019,There is not much happy going on here. The performances are amazing. Just to displease other comments... Mickey Rooney is in the movie twice. This is just a wow that somebody so well loved could have been so emotionally tortured by herself and other. Great work on the entire movie from cast to production.,Judy
440,tinkerbell-24088,Stunning,10,5 October 2019,Renee Zellweger deserves an Oscar for this performance. She has Judy Garland's mannerisms to a t! The film held me enthralled throughout. The whole cast were excellent!,Judy
441,robjwtrs-72356,Remembering an American Legend - Judy,7,8 October 2019,"I had reservations about seeing the film as it was based on the play, ""The End of The Rainbow"" by Peter Quilter. The original play, starring Tracie Bennett, was on Broadway in 2012. The play was largely a work of fiction and presented Garland in a very poor light saying and doing things that this longtime fan knew to be absolute nonsense. One scene had her popping pills intended for a dog and later pretending to urinate, leg held high, on the hotel sofa!When it was announced that there was to be a major motion picture made based on this play, I was apprehensive. Later, it was revealed that none other than Renee Zellweger was to play Judy Garland. I was doubtful that she could pull it off. Not only does she look nothing like Judy Garland but was she a strong enough actress to be believable?I have been a Garland fan and collector for more than four decades. I probably know the life of Judy Garland better than Garland herself knew her own life. Before it was released, I vowed that if it turned out to be a turkey, I'd meet everyone on the hill with my pitchfork and torch, ready to storm the castle. Now that I've had the chance to see it.....here is my assessment.The film is indeed quite different from the original book play it is based on. (That is indeed a blessing.) No longer is Judy limited to a two set stage play. The original taking place in either Garland's hotel room or the stage of ""The Talk of the Town"". This version begins in California before taking her story to London. We also see ""young Judy"" in flashbacks during her days at MGM showcasing the abuse she endured at the hands of the studio. There is also a forced subplot which shows a lonely Judy having a late-night supper with two of her gay audience members which feels more manipulative than necessary. What is regrettable is that the script is Judy's story but the timelines for things are jumbled and the screenwriter went a bit overboard with artistic license. For example, at the films beginning we see Judy along with Lorna and Joey doing their ""act"" in small California venues so that Judy can receive a paycheck of $150.00. (It is known that Judy did sing in ""impromptu"" appearances in New York City in the Fall of 1968 for pocket money, however the location is wrong and her children were never part of the equation.) Later, Judy makes the decision to accept a five week engagement at ""The Talk of the Town"" in London and flies there on her own. Mickey Deans, a character that she met at a California party, surprises her in London unannounced. (Judy actually met Mickey Deans in 1966 and saw each other frequently when Deans managed Sybil Burton's NYC nightclub, ""Arthur"". Garland and Deans flew to London together in late December, 1968.) It is unfortunate, because Judy Garland's story really didn't need to be fabricated. Her actual history is interesting on its own and this script, if to be represented as a film biography, cheapens its credibility. While it is expected that every film does take some artistic freedom to simplify a story, this is not the case with ""Judy"". Additional misrepresentations include MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer saying things to young Judy that I don't think anyone would ever have said to a sixteen year old girl in 1938; Mickey Deans and Judy breaking up before the end of the ""Talk of the Town"" engagement; Judy collapsing onstage and later cursing out her London audience, later she is terminated from the gig. (Garland actually completed her troubled five week run and never in her life was she ever verbally abusive to her audience.) I spent much of the film mentally correcting the timeline and facts as they occurred. The average film goer will be unaware of the historical inaccuracies of the film. With the exception of a few scenes, there is nothing that will destroy Miss Garland's reputation. She is portrayed as an innocent and tormented victim - damaged by the studio system and the prescription drugs that were introduced to her at a tender age.
Those unaware of Judy Garland's career beyond ""The Wizard of Oz"" will not fully comprehend why she is considered such a legend in 1968. Some of those flashback sequences should have conveyed Judy's decades of amazing success as a film actress, recording artist and concert performer. While the circumstances of Judy's life in the final year are unfortunate this was not the way things always were. Garland herself said in a 1967 television interview with Barbra Walters, ""Maybe it will distress a lot of people but I've had an awfully nice life."" It is unfortunate that the film doesn't convey that fact.As for Miss Zellweger's performance, she is a talented and effective actress. There are some scenes in which she is quite successful at representing Judy's humor and heartbreak. She is also fairly good in mimicking the inflections of Judy's speaking voice. Her performance never feels like a caricature. She does give it her all and she treats her character with respect. The hair and makeup team did a good job making her resemble her character. In fact, there are a few sequences where her appearance is very impressive. The real blunder was allowing her to perform those memorable Garland songs herself. How does one make a film about one of the most beloved singers in American music history without that recognizable voice? While it is understood that there aren't any high-fidelity recordings of Garland from this time period and even if there were, to get permission to use those recordings could be impossible and/or cost prohibitive. I had read that the director wanted this film to be more of an acting piece than a movie musical. My opinion is that they should have searched for a singer to dub in those vocals. Someone with the vocal chops to tackle those difficult arrangements and to mimic Judy's powerful sound. Garland wasn't anywhere near her vocal peak in 1968-69 but she was still better than what Renee managed to accomplish.The supporting cast are all very capable actors. The stand-outs for me were Finn Wittrock as Mickey Deans, Jessie Buckley as Judy's Talk of the Town assistant and Michael Gambon as Bernard Delfont. All three actors should have been given more to do as their talents are wasted. The costumes aren't exact replicas of Judy's original wardrobe but the styles are quite similar to what she would have worn in that era. Several are very similar in design of outfits that Garland actually wore. I personally feel they were acceptable and didn't take anything away from the film. The film is visually quite nice to look at. The sets and costumes are all well done. The musical arrangements and underscoring were on point.My final evaluation of the movie is that the on-screen talent are not really at fault for the film failing to achieve greatness. The real fault lies with the director and more so, the script. The lack of a factually accurate script and failure to heighten the musical numbers with a more effective vocalist allows the film to become somewhat forgettable. What should have been an electrifying cinematic experience really became something of a misfire. The film does treat Garland with respect for the most part. Renee Zellweger's performance is worth the price of admission and I agree with many, that she does deserve, at least an Oscar nomination. If you're a Garland fan, I encourage you to see it and form your own opinion. If you are just discovering the legendary Judy Garland, I encourage you to see her films, listen to her studio and concert recordings. Seek out her memorable television specials and her short-lived weekly CBS variety series. There was no one like her, before or since. The fact that she is still regarded as an American entertainment icon fifty years after her untimely death, speaks volumes. I repeat my belief that this film will bring a new legion of fans to discover the real Judy Garland. If the film accomplishes this, I fully support it.",Judy

447,Jordi_Sardi,"'Judy,' over the rainbow",7,30 January 2020,"Comes to our screens the biopic directed by Rupert Goold (A Real Story), which portrays the late years of the now decadent star, focusing on the irregular concerts he did at the London Palladium, in front of a divided audience, because of the eccentricities of the exdiva. Renée Zellweger is back in front of the cameras, playing a role that seems to be waiting for her, as there is an unmistakable mimicry with her alter ego.What was funny Bridget Jones now faces a diametrically opposite role that we were accustomed to, full of endless nuances, that only an actress with her worth and solvency could successfully handle. A good example of the great work done is the recent Golden Globe for Best Drama Actress, which puts her in a very good position on the road to the Oscars.However, Goold's tape does not stand out for its cinematic or narrative virtues, and it automatically becomes part of the long list of seventh-art manual music biographies, thanks to the success of Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman. o A Star is Born. Interestingly, this latest film, now starring Lady Gaga, was played by Judy Garland in 1954.",Judy

Young Judy in ""Judy"" looks absolutely nothing like her and Renee Zelwegger does not have the range to play Judy. This is basically just her playing an older version of her character from Chicago. I literally got so bored while Renee was singing that I fast forwarded through most of her songs. If you're portraying Judy Garland, the audience should be hoping for an encore, not hoping you get off the stage soon.",Judy
451,DCala65,"""Judy"" - A Transcendent Performance Tucked Inside Of A Middling Movie",6,27 October 2019,"Thanks to a powerfully raw performance from Renee Zellweger, Judy works, for the most part, while not existing as a particularly transcendent biopic. Like most music docudramas before this such as ""Ray"" starring Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and ""Walk the Line"" with the chameleon Joaquin Phoenix as an in-his-prime Johnny Cash, this film follows a normal three-act, rise-and-fall narrative structure that, by this point, is mostly cookie-cutter. What is deeply missing from this one is a more expansive historical context. The movie hop-scotches around from Judy Garland in the movie's present day of the late 1960s where she is bottoming out and desperate to regain her showstopping glory days to flashbacks to young Judy on the set and starring in the landmark musical ""The Wizard of Oz"". While these callback sequences add additional emotional heft to Judy's lifelong plight, particularly her relationship with her domineering, neglectful and abusive mother, not enough time is spent developing Judy as a larger than life figure.Zellweger tries tirelessly to come within striking distance of the real Judy's memorable and skillful vocals but ultimately misses the mark each time despite her unwavering commitment to the part that will surely put her on the Academy's radar for Oscars next year. That being said, the period is lovingly and faithfully recreated with exceptional detail but many of the dialogue scenes involving the secondary supporting characters linger a little too much. At over two hours, some script tightening would have benefited the movie's pacing in order for it to be synthesized to the essentials of Judy's life and her colossal impact on the studio system of the time.Ultimately, Judy acts as a melodramatic cautionary tale for aspiring performers and working artists by illuminating the sheer amount of no holds barred sacrifice that is needed to even have a chance at a career. Zellweger's real life dysfunction from being failed by the Hollywood machine herself bleeds into her performance and gives it a truly lived-in authenticity that is something to see. It's just unfortunate that the movie surrounding her never quite matches.",Judy
