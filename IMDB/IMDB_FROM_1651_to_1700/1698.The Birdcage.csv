0,TheLittleSongbird,Charming and a lot of fun,8,3 September 2010,"Granted The Birdcage isn't perfect, it is a little too long and the ending came across as rather sudden, but I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. It looks good, has a nice soundtrack, has a (I think) terrific script, good pacing, a fun story and above-decent direction from Mike Nichols. As for favourite scenes, there are some great scenes, but who can forget the dinner scene? The whole film is worth watching just for that scene for so many reasons. And the acting I had no problem with whatsoever. Robin Williams underplays but still delivers the laughs solidly, while Gene Hackman proves he is great as a comic actor. Dianne Wiest, Calista Flockhart and Hank Azaria also give terrific turns, however it is Nathan Lane's hilarious turn as Albert that steals the show. All in all, this is very good and very funny and charming. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The Birdcage
1,SnoopyStyle,Gaying it up doesn't make me laugh,3,2 November 2013,"A gay cabaret owner Armand Goldman (Robin Williams) and his drag queen partner Albert (Nathan Lane) put up a straight front to appease their son Val (Dan Futterman) when he brings his girlfriend Barbara Keeley (Calista Flockhart) with her right wing parents Senator Kevin Keeley (Gene Hackman) and Louise Keeley (Dianne Wiest).The gay stereotypes get very tiring. It's supposed to be funny, but I found none of it even likable. Nathan Lane is at his gayest. At least Robin Williams pulls it back a bit so that he could be angry. When the two couples get together, there is some ridiculous fun. Nathan Lane in a dress and pearls seems very fitting in this ugly mess. He's not a pretty woman. It's funny to note that he didn't actually change any of his mannerisms no matter if he's a man or a woman.I've never found flamboyant gayness automatically funny. I keep thinking I'm missing the joke. Are we suppose to laugh at them for being gay? Or maybe for being too gay? Sometimes comedians play women for a funny joke. This is different.",The Birdcage
2,Hitchcoc,An Old Fashoned Comedy,9,5 January 2017,"If it weren't for the fact this movie has as its world a gay nightclub and gay men, it could have starred Cary Grant and been one of those wacky comedies of the forties. This is absolutely a hoot. To start with, you have Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, two of the most amazing, on their feet comedians ever. Throw in the plot of ""if we could pull this off for one night,"" and everything else is up for grabs. The dialogue is excellent with all its double entendres and dramatic irony. We have the Senator, thoroughly enjoying himself, without realizing he is flirting with a man, and everything else relating to that. Of course, there is constant backtracking and improvisation. You have to laugh.",The Birdcage
3,mark.waltz,"A movie farce that truly is ""The Best of Times"".",8,12 August 2014,"While this Americanized remake of ""La Cage Aux Folles"" is not filled with all those snappy Jerry Herman songs from the 1983 Broadway musical, there are so many ironies which connect the two and make it O.K. that the story simply ended up a summertime comedy that packed in audiences, straight and gay. Ironically, in the movie ""Popeye"", Robin Williams claimed ""I Yam What I Yam"", and in ""La Cage"", his character's lover sang ""I am What I am"". Also ironic is the fact that Nathan Lane's ""The Producers"" co-star Gary Beach won great acclaim on Broadway for playing the same role which Lane plays here. Years later, Harvey Fierstein (who played Williams' brother in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") would play the same role in the third Broadway production of ""La Cage"".A big drag disco becomes the setting for the former ""La Cagelles"", right off the Atlantic coast down in Miami. Williams and Lane are a married gay couple dealing with the impending wedding of ""their"" son to the daughter of an ultra conservative politician (Gene Hackman) and his all-American wife (Dianne Wiest) who have no idea that their daughter's prospective in-laws are indeed two men which would rock Hackman's world considering that he is in charge of a ""morality"" commission determined to close all gay establishments and basically the gay community as well.In addition to all this wackiness there is Hank Azaria, the feisty ""maid"" who longs to be in Williams' drag show (which stars Lane) but genuinely has no talent. Azaria brings out all his comic genius in this scene-stealing supporting part, especially when he is put in charge of redecorating the apartment in anticipation of Hackman and Wiest's arrivals. The film follows both the original French movie and the musical almost to the letter, with the presence of Christine Baranski as young Val's (Dan Futterman) real mother. Future ""Ally McBeal"" star Calista Flockhart is amusing as Hackman and Wiest's daughter who is as far removed from her parent's conservative ways as they are with the reality of changing times.Plenty of comedy ensues out of the chaos, resulting in a drag show finale that has to be seen to be believed. There's enough music here to be its own juke-box musical, especially ""We Are Family"", the big production number for the various drag queens who provide their own share of amusement as they witness the crazy goings on around them. Wacky costumes and stylish wigs, in addition to the crazy art direction, add to the over-all direction by the legendary Mike Nichols. So go pluck yourself in the cage. You may find that you'll never want to be freed again.",The Birdcage
4,gavin6942,A Film About Acceptance That Just Seems Too Fake To Accept,6,9 October 2006,"I have heard from people over the years that ""The Birdcage"" is a good film and I thought it did fairly well at the box office. So I was hoping I would like it, and I wanted to like it... but I just can't bring myself to find a lot of redeeming qualities in this film.What we have is a gay couple (Nathan Lane and Robin Williams) who have a grown son, and he is engaged to the daughter (Calista Flockhart) of a powerful conservative senator (Gene Hackman). When the senator gets invited to dinner, things get a little silly.First, the nicest thing I can say is that the film is like a backwards version of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" because the socially acceptable people are entering the home of the social outcasts. But a backwards film exists already called ""Guess Who"", and I don't want to touch that. But anyway, in this context I guess the idea was alright.Hank Azaria is also decent as the very flamboyant male maid (dressed more like a cabana boy). Any other actor doing this and I think the part would have been going over the top (as much of this film does), but Azaria is the kind of guy who makes over the top seem normal. And Calista Flockhart looks about as attractive as she ever could in this movie, which is the nicest thing I can say about her poor acting and usually poor screen presence.The over-the-topness ruins some of what this film was trying to do, because it makes gays out to be extremely unlike other people, which I don't generally think is true. So if we are supposed to get a feel for gay lifestyles, why not make one more realistic? And the senator is just as cliché as a conservative senator (though I think he might be closer to reality than Nathan Lane is).But worst of all about this film is the way the families interact. It is unbelievable and becomes more and more so as the film goes on. I know this is a comedy, but there were many key life lessons and dramatic scenes that were just completely defecated upon because the film put comedy and weak writing in places we absolutely did not need it.This film fails, but as least it has Gene Hackman... the only reason I didn't give it less than a 5.",The Birdcage
5,lee_eisenberg,maybe it was the timing,10,26 October 2005,"In retrospect, ""The Birdcage"" looks especially good because of the timing. It was right after the Republicans had seized control of the House and Senate, partly on a platform of ""moral values"" and ""family values"". These were of course code words for ""homophobia"" and such things. In ""The Birdcage"", gay Miami cabaret owner Armand Goldman (Robin Williams) and his ""wife"" Albert (Nathan Lane) that their son Val is getting married. The only thing is, he's getting married to the daughter of ultra-right wing Sen. Kevin Keeley (Gene Hackman).This is where it gets really funny. Keeley and his cronies have formed the Coalition for Moral Order. Then, one of the co-founders is found dead with an underage prostitute. I guess that there's a lesson here: any time that a right wing ideologue starts ranting and raving about morality, it's time to turn on the suspicion-o-meter.Anyway, Armand and Albert have to do everything possible to try and act heterosexual. The scenes of these attempts are just a hoot. Also good is Dianne Wiest as Keeley's mousy wife Louise, Christine Baranski as Val's biological mother, and Hank Azaria as kooky butler Agador Spartacus. And that was actually Calista Flockhart as the daughter. Another triumph from Mike Nichols.",The Birdcage
6,jboothmillard,The Birdcage,6,28 June 2006,"I haven't always been keen on gay relationship films, mainly because I feel a bit uncomfortable when they kiss and/or have sex, but this comedy had none of that whatsoever. It just had laughs, giggles and jokes all over. Basically, Armand Goldman (Robin Williams) is the owner of a cross-dressing club called The Birdcage, and he is fearing the worst. His son, Val Goldman (Dan Futterman) wants to marry Barbara Keeley (Calista Flockhart, aka Ally McBeal) and he fears facing her parents, Sen. Kevin Keeley (Gene Hackman) and Louise Keeley (Edward Scissorhands' Dianne Wiest). Especially because of his gayness, and he doesn't want to hurt his wife's, Albert Goldman (a fantastic Golden Globe nominated Nathan Lane) feelings. Also starring The Simpsons' Hank Azaria as Agador, The Grinch's Christine Baranski Katherine Archer and True Lies' Grant Heslov as National Enquirer Photographer. A great comedy with disasters, slip-ups, near catches and many other hilarious events. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Good!",The Birdcage
7,rmax304823,Pretty Amusing Story of Roles.,6,1 February 2009,"I can't remember much of ""La Cage au Folles"", the, um, mother of this film except that Marcel Bozuffi was extremely funny in demonstrating the way men walk. But this remake is funny on its own terms. You may or may not leave prancing to ""We Are Family"" but there are scenes that are almost certain to make you chuckle.Story: A young man and his girl want to get married. The girl's parents (Gene Hackman and Dianne Weist) are a stuffy self-righteous senator and his dim wife. The young man's parents (Robin Williams and Nathan Lane) are a gay couple living together over the Miami drag club they own and in which the ""wife"" stars. Senator Bibb or Bilbo or Clagget or whatever his name is knows nothing of this arrangement, but he and his wife are invited to visit the gay couple. Williams and Lane and their friends try desperately to decorate their Miami apartment in a stereotypically masculine fashion (a giant crucifix replaces the faux Gaugin painting of a gay man). There are only a few hours in which the previously married Williams, who is the genuine father of the young man, has an opportunity to try turning the flamboyantly gay Lane into a simulacrum of masculinity. The attempt fails. Williams and Lane wind up as Mr. and Mrs. Coleman, with Lane in drag, entertaining Hackman and Weist through an excruciatingly and very amusing dinner, before all is revealed. Senator Hackman, up for reelection, finds a street full of tabloid reporters and TV crews waiting for him on the street and is forced to escape by posing as a drag queen during the show in Williams' night club -- named The Bird Cage.I suppose there must have been a lot of laughs squeezed out of the shock value of the original. I'd give it bonus points for that. This is a remake and doesn't get the bonus points of the earlier French version. Much of the material dealing with the expressive aspects of homosexuality -- the lifted pinky, the mincing walk, the squealing voice -- aren't really funny in themselves.And in fact the director, Mike Nichols, and his crew are most successful with that catastrophic dinner scene in which Hackman, Weist, Lane, Williams, and the young couple sit around a formal table with dinnerware showing copies of Greek paintings in which naked men are sodomizing each other in a daisy chain. The chef and butler is Hank Azaria who does his best but whose laughs come chiefly from pratfalls.Of course Robin Williams does a hilarious take-off on a gay man, but here he's in the butch role and must be more restrained. He's good at embarrassment and tension too, making excuses to run into the kitchen, excoriate the chef, and meanwhile guzzling Irish whiskey out of the bottle.Surprisingly, Gene Hackman's performance as the alternately charmed and astounded Senator Keeler is among the most effective in the film. The first minutes of the dinner scene have everyone sitting decorously in the living room while Hackman tries to start a conversation and the others stare at him with hellish anxiety. ""Yes, it was a nice drive down here from Washington ... We came to see the change in seasons ... yes ... First Virginia, then Tennessee ... The foliage was beautiful ... The leaves ... some red ... the road, always black, cutting through the green ... The foliage of Pennsylvania is nice too ... Of course, I've always thought the foliage of Ohio was underrated ... The different regions of this great country of ours...."" Nathan Lane as Williams' ""wife"" isn't bad but someone made a decision to play him cute as well as funny. It was probably an error. And the direction is at times a little heavy handed. In the original the character was hysterical but never cute or lovable.Think for a moment of the introduction of Dustin Hoffman in drag in ""Tootsie."" It's a crowded New York sidewalk and dozens of diverse people are marching towards the telephoto lens, and we only gradually become aware of -- HEY, that's Dustin Hoffman in that DRESS. It's very surprising and very funny.Here, Senator Hackman is ensconced in this apartment with a couple of gays and he's whining about there being no way out except through the throng of reporters waiting for him. ""Not quite,"" says Nathan Lane in a meaningful close up. Cut to the floor show of the drag club downstairs. During the exuberance of ""We Are Family"" the camera noses through a handful of male dancers in drag to settle finally on the over-sized blond wig of a man with his back to the camera. It's entirely predictable. It's out of a Bob Hope movie. We know what's going to happen the moment Nathan Lane gets his cute idea and the sense of astonishment is thrown away.Well -- some scenes are funnier than others, but the funny ones make this a worthwhile watch.",The Birdcage
8,moonspinner55,"Not a good, honest laugh until at least an hour into the proceedings",5,4 July 2002,"American remake of 1978's ""La Cage aux Folles""--a French-Italian comedy which itself spawned two sequels and gave way to a Broadway musical--seems awfully hoary and obvious by now. Robin Williams is not convincing as the gay owner of a drag club down Miami way who has to pretend to be straight to please his son's fiancée's conservative folks, thereby leaving his drag queen lover out of the party. In this role, Nathan Lane gets easy laughs (and his over-the-top ridiculousness does enliven the picture), but he makes the character a cartoon, not a person. In fact, there are few people here to truly care about, particularly not the vapid sweethearts in love. Hank Azaria is the stand-out as a flaming houseboy. Otherwise, ""The Birdcage"" is best described as 'limp'. ** from ****",The Birdcage
9,blanche-2,Robin Williams and Nathan Lane as a gay couple,8,3 June 2006,"Though nothing can beat ""La Cage aux Folles,"" the film on which this American version is based, I still found ""The Birdcage"" delightful fun and hilarious at times, thanks to the comic geniuses of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. Lane is the dramatic Albert, an over the top drag queen who has lived for years with Robin Williams, Armand, the owner of The Birdcage, where Albert performs. Armand once had a liaison with a woman, which produced a son, Val, who now wants to be married to the daughter of a conservative politician. In order for that to occur, Armand has to become butch, all gay art work, etc., needs to exit the apartment - and Albert must disappear for a few days.Williams is hilarious - my two favorite scenes are his rehearsal with Albert and a young man appearing with him on stage, and the scene where he coaches Armand on being macho - priceless. Nathan Lane's shtick is familiar to me, as I've seen him in ""The Producers"" and ""The Odd Couple"" - he's a riot as the insecure, jealous, easily hurt Albert.The role of Val is problematic, because how does one keep him from looking like a complete bastard as he shuts out Armand, who raised him. But Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart as Barbara make a lovely young couple. Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest are very funny as Barbara's befuddled parents.It's been a long time since I've seen the French ""La Cage aux Folles,"" and I saw the musical on Broadway as well. The French is superior to any version. The musical is quite poignant and emphasizes its statement in the song, ""I Am Who I Am."" The joy of the French film is that the actors playing the lovers, Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault, play their roles very seriously, and the humor and poignancy come out of the situation and the outrageousness of the Armand character (Albin/Zaza in the French). In ""The Birdcage,"" it's played for comedy all the way. That's okay. You'll still enjoy it. But see the original.",The Birdcage
10,Doylenf,Gay couple trying to tone it down for the sake of son's marriage...,6,20 September 2006,"You have to be willing to laugh at gay stereotypes to get your kicks out of THE BIRDCAGE, and once you do submit to the zaniness of the impossible plot you can sit back and enjoy this hilarious comedy directed by Mike Nichols. Comic timing is a gift, and most of the cast has it in spades. Least successful at this sort of comedy is GENE HACKMAN, but even he manages to get laughs from his stuffy character.ROBIN WILLIAMS is the gay nightclub owner whose son is marrying a respectable girl with uptight, conventional parents, GENE HACKMAN and DIANNE WIEST. The son is anxious for his future in-laws to meet a normal family and pleads with his father to throw out all the gay furnishings and act like a normal father. Unfortunately, Robin's long-time lover, NATHAN LANE, is hopelessly over-the-top as a campy gay and there is no way to tone him down. Williams decides to try to pass him off as his son's uncle but the plan backfires with hilarious consequences.It takes an exhausting amount of ingenuity to bring the plot to fruition but Mike Nichols' witty screenplay has everyone playing it strictly for laughs. CALISTA FLOCKHART and DAN FUTTERMAN are fine as the young lovers. You have to wonder how much of the interplay between Williams and Lane was improvised. Whatever, it never fails to be anything less than hilarious. The plot thickens when Williams gets his ex-wife CHRISTINE BARANSKI to pretend she's his current wife for the sake of company.Needless to say, when the big night arrives for the meeting, everything and anything goes wrong. Nichols keeps things moving with laughter, sentiment, tears, keeping the characters likable despite their overwhelming flaws. The ending is just as improbable as the main story but, again, it's not supposed to be taken seriously so why worry? It's still a fun way to spend an evening, thanks mainly to Nathan Lane's warmly amusing turn as Williams' ""wife"", and the strong relationship he has to their son.In a rather thankless role, DAN FUTTERMAN brings sincerity and charm to his role as the concerned son anxious to please his future in-laws.",The Birdcage
11,preppy-3,See the original,6,20 June 2002,"A gay couple (Robin Williams, Nathan Lane) have to play it straight when their son (Dan Futterman) wants to marry a girl (Calista Flockheart) who has ultra right-wing parents (Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest).This is a virtual word by word remake of a very funny 1978 French movie ""La Cage Aux Folles"".  The French film was hilarious and (in its time) daring. Some of it's views are dated, but not offensive.  ""The Birdcage"" follows the original script VERY closely and adds a few (unfunny) lines of it's own. Incredibly, though, it throws in every offensive gay stereotype known. There's the lisping, queeny maid (Hank Azaria), the EXTREMELY effeminate man (Nathan Lane) and his mincing, swishy partner (Robin Williams).  The film encourages you to laugh at their mannerisms again and again.  As a gay man I was very offended (especially by Azaria).  But I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh.Williams is a bit too swishy but, basically, underplays nicely.  Lane is way way WAY over the top and very loud and offensive--I really hated him. Futterman is the most obnoxious character in the film--badly acted, smarmy and a real jerk.  Flockheart (pre-Ally McBeal) is very good but is given nothing to work with.  Azaria was so horribly stereotyped I wanted to scream.  However, Hackman and Wiest were a scream as the couple.  And Christine Baranski shows up and brightens up the movie.  Also the film is very colorful and there's plenty of buff guys and gals wearing next to nothing to get your attention.  All in all though, it's not as good as the original.  This film is dated and full of homophobia.  At least the 1978 film isn't like that.",The Birdcage
12,lastliberal,Rolling on the floor laughing my a** off,8,2 May 2007,"I cannot imagine a show that has a cast list like this to not be great. Add to it the fact that it was written by Elaine May (Heaven Can Wait) and directed by Mike Nichols (Closer), and you have a formula for success.Just look at the cast: Robin Williams (The Fisher King), Nathan Lane (Encore! Encore!), Gene Hackman (The Royal Tenenbaums), Dianne Wiest (A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints), Hank Azaria (Mystery, Alaska), Dan Futterman (The Fisher King), and Christine Baranski (Maryann Thorpefrom Cybill).

13,grantss,Entertaining,6,2 May 2015,"Entertaining...in spells. Also quite silly and/or dull in spells.Had the potential to be a very good comedy, as well as comment on bigotry and homophobia. In the end is a decent, but not great comedy. Some of the dialogue is very funny, but the movie often teeters on the edge of descending into pointless farce. Some of the gags and sub- plots go nowhere.While taking a small stab at right-wing conservatism, the movie isn't that profound in terms of dealing with homophobia. Admittedly it is a comedy, not a drama, but the set-up was already there.Good performances by Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in the lead roles. Good support from Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest, Hank Azaria, Calista Flockhart, Dan Flutterman and Christine Baranski.",The Birdcage

15,Boba_Fett1138,One of the best and refreshing comedies I have seen in a long time.,9,9 August 2006,"Why didn't anyone ever told me this movie was THAT GOOD. It came as a real pleasant surprise. I have always wanted to see this movie, ever since I had first seen its posters hanging around town here in 1996 and after watching its hilarious trailer multiple times. But you know how these things go, I never watched the movie until now, 10 years later. I'm certainly glad I finally did, for the movie really surpassed my expectations.The movie its premise sounds like a cheap comedy with formulaic gay and drag queen jokes. Well let me tell you, it's filled with the stereotypes and the stereotypical jokes that come with it. It however is done in such a good and hilarious way that the movie becomes original on its own, despite its formulaic premise. Main reason why everything works out so well is due to its wonderful and perfectly cast cast-members.It's about a controversial subject but the movie itself is not controversial at all. Of course it still does have a message in it and it tries to make a statement but it does this in a 'non-forcing' way. While watching this movie you don't have the feeling that this movie is preaching for homosexuality acceptance or anything of that kind. It does make fun of gay persons and drag queens but it does this in such an over-the-top way that nobody should be offended or bothered by the movie its stereotypical homosexual comical moments. The fact that this movie is not about an every day subject we often see in movie, it makes the movie all the more refreshing and comical original to watch.Basically the movie is one big funny build up to the hilarious ending were the right-wing in-laws meet the gay Jewish father-father/mother. It's like a predecessor of ""Meet the Parants"", instead this time with right-wing politician as the father in-law and a gay couple as the parents of the groom-to-be. They try to conceal their sexuality the best as they can but of course everything that can go wrong goes wrong, only about an hundred times worse than you would expect. It makes the ending absolutely great and very hilarious to watch. It's filled with the one hilarious and unlikely event after the other.But of course not just the ending of this movie is hilarious. It's an hilarious movie with basically all the stereotypical jokes and ideas about homosexuals present in the movie. All the jokes work so well thanks to its wonderful cast. Robin Williams is great and above all really believable in his role. It's not the sort of movie in which he acts crazy and starts jumping and screaming around, it instead is a sincere and real performance that still is also perfectly comical thanks to Williams his great comical timing. But absolute show-stealer was Nathan Lane as the drag queen. He is absolute hilarious and although he goes over-the-top, the character is saved and made believe throughout his acting. It's also great to see Gene Hackman in a comedy for a change and I must admit that he certainly didn't do a bad job. Not a bad job at all. Also really great was Dianne Wiest, whose comical timing was absolute spot-on. Hank Azaria also plays a fun role, as the extreme gay-housekeeper/butler. Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart were somewhat distracting from the movie and kept out the pace a little, mainly due to the fact that their roles aren't comical one's and the fact that they play young in love teenager, while at the time they were both already close in their thirties and they had no chemistry at all on screen. Such a shame since the movie and its premise is set mostly around themIf you want to see a comedy that will make you laugh-out-loud, this movie is perfect for you. All gay stereotypes are present but done in a very refreshing and hilarious way, not in the least thanks to the wonderful cast.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Birdcage
16,evanston_dad,Less Sophisticated Than the Original But Also More Fun,8,17 June 2009,"Mike Nichols took a crack at remaking the 1979 French farce ""La Cage aux Folles"" and, dare I say, improved on the original.The two films are nearly identical in plot, but the French film is far less funny.

""The Birdcage,"" in contrast, is much broader and more slapstick to be sure, but it's also more reliable as a straight-up laugh vehicle.Robin Williams and Nathan Lane play this version's gay lovers; it's refreshing for once to see Williams play the comic straight man, and Lane is a riot, especially when trying to learn how to walk and talk like John Wayne.

17,anaconda-40658,For the Birds.,8,21 May 2015,"The Birdcage (1996): Dir: Mike Nichols / Cast: Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, Diane Wiest, Christine Baranski: One of the best remakes ever made and it pretty much matches the French classic La Cage Aux Folles scene for scene and word for word. Title suggest hidden traits or closet homosexual. The cage is the closet while homosexuals represent the birds. Robin Williams runs a nightclub where drag queens entertain including the much adored Nathan Lane. Williams's son is engaged to the Senator's daughter and he is requested to change his lifestyle so that the Senator will not suspect it. Reluctantly Williams agrees but when Lane refuses to take a vacation he experiments with the idea of going straight, which leads to hilarious moments. Fine directing by Mike Nichols who has toyed before with secret lifestyles in films such as The Graduate and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Williams is flawless as the club manager out to please his son, while Lane is hilarious as a fragile drag queen. Gene Hackman and Diane Wiest make great foils as the Senator and wife who dodge media yet accept this couple as legitimate. How a crucial issue is solved makes the film's concluding joke a huge payoff. Christine Baranski plays Williams's supportive ex-wife who is unable to be at a crucial place at the right time. Theme regards secret lives that risk exposure. Score: 8 / 10",The Birdcage

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,Fabulous!!!!!!!,10,4 November 2005,"""The Birdcage"" is a hilarious movie about a happily ""married"" gay couple, forced to play straight for the marriage for Armond's son and his conservative in-laws. Even though it is a bit stereotypical, it was played with charm and energy and is absolutely irresistible. I really enjoyed ""The Birdcage"" because it had a lot of serious issues, yet managed to turn into a fun joke. We take the politic stand on gay marriages so seriously, that I think this was needed just for a good laugh at it.Nathan Lane and Robin Williams, what terrific performances! Again, I know it was stereotypical, but I have a couple friends that do actually act like that. So, I was more than willing to go with it. I loved the whole Nathan being the Mom dinner scene. It was just too hard not to laugh. I am little surprised by the rating of 6.5. I think people should see this film and just have a good time with it. Trust me, it's just a fun movie and it's not offensive in any way.10/10",The Birdcage
22,sddavis63,Nathan Lane Steals The Show,8,30 June 2008,"It's hard to imagine saying this about an outrageous comedy, but Robin Williams - who made his career (at least the early part of it) by doing outrageous comedy (and the more outrageous the better) is completely, totally and absolutely outshone in ""The Bird Cage"" by Nathan Lane. That's not a criticism of Williams. He was fine, but Lane was simply over the top funny as the very feminine drag queen Albert, the gay lover/spouse of Armand (Williams). Armand and Albert have a son they've raised (Val, played by Dan Futterman) and he's about to get married to Barbara (Calista Flockhart). The catch? Barbara's father is the extremely conservative Senator Kevin Keeler (Gene Hackman) and he'll be none too pleased by the family his daughter is marrying in to.You'll laugh pretty much the whole way through at Lane, and it isn't just Lane. At times, Williams is playing the second or even third banana by the end of the movie. There's Albert and Armand's ""maid"" Agador Spartacus (Hank Azaria) who's almost as funny as Lane, and (while I don't want to give too much away) when you catch a glimpse of Hackman in drag near the end of the movie you'll be in stitches.It's great fun, burdened a little bit by an unnecessary decision to have Keeler involved in a political scandal. The whole movie would have worked quite well without that particular subplot. Still, this is a very funny movie. turn to it whenever you need a laugh. 8/10",The Birdcage
23,ElMaruecan82,"The funniest gay-duo ever, with Robin Williams as the straight-man, so to speak",8,28 July 2013,"""Traduttore, tradittore"" the Italian adage seems to indicate that the transposition of a concept or an artistic creation to another language would inevitably betray its spirit. It's true that most of the times, comedy is the most likely genre to suffer from adaptation and the most eloquent proof can be found in the love-and-hate relationship between French comedies and their much inferior American remakes. Almost every Francis Veber's script for instance, was remade for American audience, and needless to say that some films turns out to be sour disasters, or average entertainments at best.Directed by Mike Nichols, ""The Birdcage"" is the remake of 'Birds of Feathers' (""La Cage aux Folles""), the greatest Italian-French comedy, starring Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault, and one of the most successful French productions in America. Although it was fair for Nichols to assume that the 1996' audience wouldn't be familiar with the original film, it was risky as well to embrace such a politically incorrect theme, featuring a gay couple with one acting like a hysterical diva, and transpose it in the 90's where the 70's archetypes were no longer held as comedic devices. Needless to say that the performances of the whole cast was crucial, let alone Nathan Lane, who is the highlight of the show.The plot is pure screwball material, Armand (Williams) lives with Albert (Lane) for twenty years, Armand owns a gay burlesque bar in South Florida named ""The Birdcage"" and directs the very show where Albert stars. Albert acts like a capricious prima donna all the time, always seeming at the edge of a nervous breakdown, praising for attention, he's obviously the ""lady"" in the couple, and it seems quite fresh to see Williams as the most restrained one, and not let himself carried away by Albert's caprices. The rest of the house also features a Hank Azaria as a Guatemalan butler named Agador, his accent, extraordinary capability to imitate Estefan's ""Konga"" and some crazy one-liners are really under-appreciated.The routine is broken when Val, Armand's son announces his engagement with the daughter of a republican and notoriously conservative, a Senator named Kevin Keeley (Gene Hackman). Keeley isn't in a better phase because his closest friend and President of the Coalition of Moral Virtues was found dead with an underage black prostitute, a synthesis of every worst- case situation that can undermine a political career. Naturally, his daughter (a pre-McBeal Calista Flockhart) is forced to lie about Armand's profession and Keeley's wife (Dianne Wiest) seize the wedding as an opportunity to clear Keeley from the prejudice caused by the scandal. With these two set-ups, the movie takes off for one of the funniest and most enjoyable recent comedy of errors.Some would naturally get offended by Lane's portrayal of Albert, but the fact is that the film is precisely funny because he's effeminate. It gives its flavor to the scene where he wants to pretend he's Val's uncle, and then learns from Albert how to butter a toast like a man, and not get upset if it gets pierced, and walk like John Wayne. Albert's high pitched screams and overly-gay mannerisms contribute to some of the film's most laugh-out-loud moments and can't take you off totally off-guard, but Lane doesn't overplay them, he finds the right note in an over-the-top personality. And it never shows as well as in the scene where he comes, dressed like a man, only to betray some pink socks, that make even more obvious the fact that he's gay.And that's the basis of the whole comical premise, the more you pretend not to be something, the more it shows. But one thing Lane shows without pretending is how loving and caring he's for Val, and that's what makes his character so endearing and engaging. He's a clown but a sad and funny one, while Williams is the 'straight' man, comically speaking of course, and when a champagne bottle suddenly pops, the effect is immediate, it's pure comedic gold. There are two levels of comedies, where Williams is both the straight man and the clown of a masquerade, no wonder he spent the whole night drinking. Talk about a comical existential nightmare.The secret of ""The Birdcage"" is to remain faithful to the spirit of the first film, but not without taking some perspective from the original material. The fact that they're Jewish adds another running their name, is it Goldman or Coleman, is the 'd' silent or what? The political undertones are accentuated, maybe because it was before the election campaign, but they seem to be more fitting for the American context, and Gene Hackman is absolutely perfect as the Republican Senator who tries to hide his desperation between a cold facade, he's even more interesting than the original character because the screenplay enriches his personality with his genuine fondness on Albert.And we understand the Senator, Lane plays a drag with such genuine tenderness that we empathize with his desire to help Val. But since we know that it's meant to fail, we can only enjoy the way they keep the Senator believing. And it's indeed funny how Albert touches the Senator's heart when pretending to be Val's mother ""they don't make women like that anymore"", maybe in a way, Albert fulfilled his all-time dream to be a woman and be treated as well. ""The Birdcage"" is a film that should have deserved more recognition, less than a remake, it's more of a refreshing and modernization of the 70's version, and it's so lively, so flamboyant, so comical, it seems to reconcile with an idea of the 'gay' culture, that no matter how stereotypical it is, remains more enjoyable than its claim for banality.The style is dated but not the tone. ""The Birdcage"" deserves all its praises, it's not only one of the few successful American remakes of French comedies, it's more intelligent than what it seems  and it's funny as hell.",The Birdcage
24,g-bodyl,Filled With Endearing Performances!,9,10 February 2015,"The Birdcage is a fine movie that is based off it's wonderful performances, especially from Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. The movie is quite funny and it has a focus on a rather controversial issue, an issue which would make the national headlines within a few years after this film's release. The film has a tight screenplay that delivers some surprisingly strong lines and the film actually has a core that is emotional. Mike Nichol's film is about a man named Armand who owns a drag club and lives with his long-time partner who is the star of the drag club. One day, Armand's son comes to visit to say that he is getting married to the daughter of a United States Senator, a man who does not support minorities and homosexuality. The parents agree to meet for dinner, as his son persuades Armand to put on a straight act for one night only. The performances in the film are spot-on. Robin Williams delivers a funny though rather toned-down performance as Armand. Although Robin manages to be more straight-laced than usual, he does manage a few great jokes. Nathan Lane delivers a fine performance as Albert Goldman, Armand's lover. He actually made for a great woman. Gene Hackman is good as always as Kevin Keeley, the senator involved in a scandal. Dianne Wiest is good as his supportive wife. Overall, The Birdcage is a really good, funny movie that has quite a few memorable lines. The dinner scene is my favorite scene and it shows that dinner parties are rarely perfect, especially if secrets are being hidden. 2014 was a really sad year as we lost two major contributors of this film: Robin Williams and director Mike Nichols. I am glad I was able to view this film in order to more appreciate their works. I rate this film 9/10.",The Birdcage
25,lesleyharris30,"A Hilarious, Character Driven Comedy,",9,30 May 2015,"The Birdcage is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It's a really refreshing and unique comedy, there really isn't any other film quite like it, it's very driven by the characters, more so than the story itself, which I really liked, a lot of their dialogue had absolutely nothing to do with developing the story and to keep it moving, and these parts are certainly my favourite. It's runtime was a bit unnecessary, for a film as goofy and flamboyant as this, I think a ninety minute run is really as long as it needs to be, it's not that I didn't enjoy the two hours, I just felt it didn't need to be that long. The cast is superb and all suit their characters perfectly, Robin Williams and Nathan Lane certainly have the best scenes together, improvising the majority of their lines, I also thought Hank Azaria was outstanding as Agador, and seeing Gene Hackman play such a serious role in a goofy film was very funny. Packed with non stop laughs and superb comedic performances, I would recommend the Birdcage to anyone looking for a good comedy. A man makes his gay parents pretend to be a husband and wife as he plans to marry a woman with political parents. Best Performance: Robin Williams",The Birdcage
26,secondtake,"One of half a dozen verions of La Cage aux Folles out there, and Nathan Lane is devastating",7,9 July 2011,"The Birdcage (1996)Well, there is always something great about a Mike Nichols film, and this one, written and directed by Nichols, is no exception. It is however a story that has had better presentations (see below) and I'm not sure why Nichols opted for such an un-original material. The movie really is great in some ways, and has terrific moments, but it doesn't transcend, as the best Nichols films certainly do.Robin Williams, the apparent big name on the marquee, is the weakest link in the cast (not including the two young people, who are fine but routine). But the rest of the main actors, Nathan Lane as the drag queen most of all, but Gene Hackman as a conservative senator and Dianne Wiest as his wife, are an amazing ensemble. Throw in consistently funny and clever writing (a functioanl adaptation), good camera-work, obviously attractive sets (this is South Beach in Miami), and a lively soundtrack and you sort of can't go far wrong.Is it brilliant? No way. It doesn't need to be. It's got jokes that will fade with time, topical references and timely jabs, but overall it's just perky and funny top to bottom. And relentlessly. And yes, it pushes its point hard, about how we're all people and relationships are relationships, and that's where the comedy matters, making sure you don't take the delivery too seriously. If you have doubts that it's a farce with a silver lining, just wait until you see Gene Hackman at the end.You might argue that the social message is all that matters, and of course that's true to some ways of thinking (and in some camps of criticism), but that would limit the point of the whole affair. And as time goes on and people get more used to the idea of gay culture and gay people as just another aspect of life, well, the sensational aspects of the movie will water down. But that's fine. Besides being inevitable, it points to the other parts of the film, the Shakespearean cross-dressing, the play on identities, the constant repartee. It's funny and fun and yet smart, too. The plot, at its core, is an Americanized version of the original French play (from 1973) La Cage aux Folles (which means roughly ""Cage of Drag Queens"" if you take into account the slang for folles). And there is of course the famous two versions of the Broadway musical version (the 1983 and 2004 versions, not to mention the current one which started in 2010). It's a great story with a long life, clearly. And the playful interaction of the ensemble is perfect for the stage.Yet this isn't the play nor the musical, but the film, with a new name. And the photographic aspects are pretty wonderful, too. Take just the opening shot coming in on a helicopter over the water and seamlessly (almost, there's a frame or two glitch) gliding right into the night club, The Birdcage. And if you don't think the story has legs, there is a 1978 Italian version of the play (not the musical) on film. The advantage of the American version for American audiences is the references are still slightly recognizable (the Bob Dole comments are already seeming like history, however).Anyway, don't see this for Robin Williams. He's fine, but not the crackup fast talker that he's best at. And it isn't him, but Nathan Lane, who gets to cross-dress. Fabulously. You'll see.",The Birdcage
27,ironhorse_iv,"If you don't get this movie, try some more gum",7,5 February 2013,"I know that look. Hit me, go on. Hit me with why this movie isn't good, because I don't see that face plant of why I should hate this Mike Nichol's film. Yes, it might look like a pale copy of the original La Cage aux Folles, the 1978's French film in itself based on the 1973's play by Jean Poiret, but it's not a drag. Well, it's a drag in another way, but what I like about this remake is how they turns something from French, into a funny American movie. Armand Goldman (Robin Williams) owns a popular drag nightclub in South Miami Beach with his long-time lover Albert Goldman (Nathan Lane). Nathan Lane as Albert is a annoying character with his fits, non-stop complaining and diva like attitude. Some audience members might find the character too irritation to bother with the movie. Some audience members will look past that, due to fact that Albert is so hysterical due to his overreactions to everything. If some people dislike him, they would love the crude humor toward him from Armand. As much as Armand can not stand him, he sticks with Albert. Within the comedy, is a small great speech scene by Armand to Albert. These are two gay men of a certain age, and years of ostracism, threats and taunts would have conditioned them both to avoid any PDAs, no matter how strong the feeling between them. The speech gives the moment enormous poignancy feeling of genuine, heartfelt and caring to Albert. This scene is especially lovely, a great juxtaposition to the rest of the film which is wonderfully silly and comedic. Nathan Lane isn't the only one that nearly steals the movie from Robin Williams, as Armand's maid Agador Spartacus (Hank Azaria) takes a bite of funny throughout the film, with singing and dancing to music, making lousy food, and tripping over his own feet. Watching Agador was a delight, and pans away from Nathan Lane enough times, that we able to rest from his big, brassy yelling and complaining. Soon the Goldman's son Val (Dan Futterman) comes home to announce his engagement to Barbara Keely (Calista Flockhart), daughter of Kevin Keely (Gene Hackman), US Senator, and vice president of the extreme Committee for Moral Order and his wife (Dianne Wiest). First off, the actor Dan Futterman and Calista Flockhart were too old for the role, it felt weird in a way to see Calista play a awkward 18 year old. Both are in later scenes, boozing and smoking. Are we suppose to believe that a conservatism senator would allow his daughter to underage drink? Clearly both are wrong actors for the job. Gene Hackman as Kevin Keely is so extreme right conservatism, it makes the character seem like a political cartoon caricature less than a normal person. Kevin Keely decide to allow Barbara to marry Val only if they meet Val and his family at South Beach and use the marriage to get the media off of the scandal of his co-founder that been focus on him. While in Miami, Val fearing the worst like the Senator will not allow Barbara to marry him. Val tries to convince his father to hide his relationship with Albert and the fact that he is gay and Jewish. At first, Armand stood tall for his right to be open about his sexuality and his religious views, but seeing how much it would mean for him. He allow the dinner to happen, and to make himself seem straight and asking to get rid of Albert for the day was over the line. I just can't stand Dan Futterman's character, for this, what a jerk. First off, Calista's character is clearly old enough to get marry with or without her father permission, and second off, it was the 90's. It wasn't the Leave it to Beaver pre-sexualism freedom 1960's here. I felt it was wrong how Val treats his father to hide who his Father was, ask Albert to leave, all for a girl who only knew for a year. The whole thing was shameful on the part of the character. I know he wasn't in shame of his father's lifestyle, but he knew that Keelys wouldn't understand, and I know without this premise there is no movie, but still he only admit his fault to due to being catch, rather than seeing his wrongs on how he treated his father and Albert the last few days. I also felt the ending was a cop-out, as it's seem like there should had been an extra scene to show how the movie's plot got resolved. Yes it might seem like a bird-brained delight, but you just can't help loving it, and not taking it too serious. The movie acts less like La Cage aux Folles and more like a modern ""You can't take it with you"", a 1938 film. The music in the film is catchy, love the use of Sister Sledge- We are family, Gloria Estefan- conga, and Alan Lerner- I could have danced all night. It add with the positive good mood of the film. The whole singing scene before dinner was the best. What the movie does well is going beyond the stereotypes to see the character's depth and humanity, and that's why this movie should be check out. Try it, and you will find yourself liking it as much as I do.",The Birdcage
28,Dr_Coulardeau,Do not kill the mocking bird!,10,26 July 2018,"Why on earth do Americans haD to remake such an enormously successful French film as ""La Cage aux Folles""? Because America is a country, maybe THE country, of immigrants and all they do or redo is imported, particularly in the cultural field. Think of Walt Disney and European culture. Even Mickey Mouse has a European taste and flavor in its diapers. The only thing they haven't been able to acclilmatize is French cheese. But think of Swiss pastry, Danish pastry, French fries, and so many other things. Whiskey comes from Ireland or maybe Scotland (though they will never be able to imitate tar-Scotch), vodka comes from Russia. And in this field of drinks, only Coca-Cola is really American. Even Canada Dry is Canadian by name, and root beer is so old in Europe and other continents that we cannot really credit it as American. And standard American beer is lilke diluted beetroot juice when compared to the super-strong European beers climbing up to 12% or more.But what about this film? A film about drag queens in the USA, in Florida, in Miami or some other seaside resort, seems to be extreme for American taste, and even in fact very tentative. To Americanize the whole thing, they added a son to the couple, a girlfriend to the son, a wedding between the two, I mean a ""normal"" wedding between a man and a woman, with a man who declares in the presence of his genetic mother that the drag queen of a spouse his father has is his mother. And yet that was not enough. So they added a conservative senator and his conservative wife as the parents of the girlfriend. Brilliant! Then since it is political it can be accepted as a comedy because all things political are comedy, comical, funny, lies and make-believe. So then it works and they added a Latino servant in the house who cannot wear shoes without falling every other step, and a meal that is so miserable that it is an insult to the gay community that is known for its good taste in food and drinks. Enjoy the entertainment and do not forget same-sex marriage today is legal in the USA, like in many, if not most countries in the world. Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Birdcage
29,Red-125,La Cage aux folles in South Beach,9,21 August 2019,"The Birdcage (1996) was directed by Mike Nichols with screenplay by Elaine May (among others). The movie is based on an earlier French film, La cage aux folles (1978).Robin Williams plays Armand Goldman, the owner of a successful South Beach nightclub in which all the performers are drag queens. Nathan Lane portrays his partner and featured artist, Albert.In his only heterosexual encounter, Armand fathered a son. The plot revolves around the hoped-for marriage between his son, Val (Dan Futterman) and a young woman named Barbara Keeley (Calista Flockhart ).The only problem is that Barbara is the daughter of Senator Kevin Keeley
(Gene Hackman). Senator Keeley is a conservative, right-wing politician who has made his name by forcefully advocating ""family values."" He and his wife Louise (Dianne Wiest) have to be convinced that the young man comes from a solid family background.That's the plot. The fun is in how it works out. And, happily, there really is plenty of fun. The actors are superb, the gags are great, and the whole film has a upbeat feeling to it.OK--stereotypes abound, but the gay men in the movie are treated with respect. Senator Keeley has plenty of barbs thrown at him, but his character is treated with enough respect that the zingers don't destroy him.Director Nichols went to the A-list for his actors. Flockhart, Futterman, Hackman, Lane, Wiest, and Williams were all major stars. They all delivered outstanding performances. It's a pleasure to see a movie that depends on major stars not just showing up, but really putting their talents to use.We saw this film in an unusual venue--Rochester's GEVA Theatre. The showing was presented by ImageOut, the organization that brings us the Rochester LGBT Film Festival. The choice of venue brought in people who don't normally go to the ImageOut Festival. Everyone appeared to be laughing, and it was a pleasure to view the film surrounded by other people who were enjoying it. The venue made perfect sense, because GEVA will be presenting the play La cage aux folles in a few weeks.Like many films--especially colorful ones like The Birdcage--this movie will work better on a large screen than a small one. However, it's a really great film, and worth seeing in any way you can find it.The Birdcage has a acceptable IMDb rating of 7.1. I think it's much better than that, and I highly recommend it.",The Birdcage

31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A flamboyant and hysterical farce, but also a touching one",8,6 July 2008,"At last a comedy where men don't just dress in drag for kicks. While ""The Birdcage"" certainly does get laughs for cross-dressing, director Mike Nichols and this exceptionally talented cast prove that comedies centering around gay characters can be about more than exploiting gay lifestyles for the predominantly straight public. This sensitivity is what makes ""The Birdcage"" a step above your average farce.Having been adapted from Jean Poiret's play ""La Cage Aux Folles,"" the concept for the film is nothing that someone well-read/watched in comedy hasn't seen before (a traditional farce). Of course Nichols and accomplished comedy writer Elaine May have updated this film for modern times (South Florida). Armand Goldman (Williams) owns a gay cabaret and his partner Albert (Lane) is the star. A one-time fling left Armand with a son who is now 20 and is serious about his girlfriend, enough so that her parents want to meet his parents over dinner--only her parents are right-wing political family-values oriented people. Gene Hackman is an excellent supporting role as a conservative senator in the middle of a scandal.The duo of Williams and Lane, however, is the bread and butter. These two have a way of creating an intimacy that clearly goes beyond friendship. They are really good at all-out improvisational comedy, but also, if not better, at toning it down for the tender moments. There performances also steer clear of stereotypes. While Lane's character is definitely flamboyant, it doesn't feel unnatural or offensive. While the plot would make it really easy to use stereotypes way too much to go for some gut-busting humor, Nichols takes the sensitive approach and doesn't let the humor get in the way of some really good material centering around gay family issues.As a viewer, even if you were to come at this film with a right-wing perspective or just wanted to get some laughs at the expense of cross-dressers, ""The Birdcage"" will not let you turn a blind eye to the ideas of being true to one's self while being true to one's family or preconceived family values. Even if it goes the typical path of farces that reach a climax of hi-jinx followed by the sentimental explanation, the characters are incredibly well-crafted and too enjoyable to dismiss the sentimentality as corny.So while it might seem like an over-the-top gay comedy, it really is sensitive to homosexuals while other gay comedies don't necessarily do that. It may be difficult for someone who has very rigid values that don't include gay lifestyles to sit back and enjoy this film, but other than that group, ""The Birdcage"" can be enjoyed by anyone with a sense of maturity about sexuality.",The Birdcage

In this case, we have comedic gold. Robin Williams headlines but Nathan Lane is the star of this filled festival of frolicing, where everybody throws in their characters worth and has the audience on the floor laughing.Robin Williams and Nathan Lane play two gay Jewish lovers in Florida who own a drag club called The Birdcage. William's straight son is going to get married to the daughter of a Rightest Senator from Ohio. Williams and Lane decide to try to play it straight for a night, which means turning everything in their comfortable world upside down and inside out to pull it all together.The writing is simply excellent, great dialog and very quotable. Even if the movie itself ended up terribly, it would have had good camp value regardless. However, the movie itself is supported strongly by the fantastic work of the acting, especially Lane because he is able to not only convince the audience about his character, but have his character try and act as well, thus creating multiple levels of personality hard to come to terms with inside of just one person. Williams does well too, but probably the best counterpart to Lane is Hank Azaria in a hilariously gay role and Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest as the conservative parents. They actually make the conservatism the movie pokes at believable while not becoming too mocking or too caricaturistic.All in all, it's a good time, and great fun for the whole (openminded) family.--PolarisDiB",The Birdcage

A little too cutesy, as if Hallmark was supposed to educate the world about what gay men are like. However, it was redeemed for me by Hank Azaria, who was brilliant.

Although I was flamboyant it brought to light all the stereotypes and characteristics I was ashamed off. Since than I've learned to enjoy it. And revisiting it now I find it absolutely hilarious. Sure the movie is filled with stereotypes but its celebrated and in a time where we are being more open minded and exploring the film is a positive representation of being ones self and loving yourself for it. Robin Williams and Nathan Kane are beyond spectacular, Hank Azaria is a scene stealer, and Gene Hackman, Diane Ladd, Calista Flockhart, Christine Baranski and sexy Dan Futternan are solid as well. All these years later the film stands as not just an amazing comedy but a lesson in acceptance and celebration.Budget: $31m

41,brchthethird,Robin Williams and Nathan Lane make a great comic team in this remake of a classic French film,8,13 November 2014,"Many years ago I watched LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, which this film is based on, and incidentally was one of the first foreign language films I ever saw. From what I remember, it was a laugh-riot from beginning to end, and was very economical at 96 minutes. THE BIRDCAGE, directed by Mike Nichols and starring Robin Williams, Nathan Lane and Gene Hackman, tells essentially the same story but with an American bent. While I can respect the changes that were made, at about 25 minutes longer things could have been more streamlined than they were. Here, Robin Williams plays a more subtle comedic character as Armand, the owner of the titular Birdcage, a drag club where his partner Albert (Nathan Lane) is the star performer. When his son Val comes home for a visit, he tells his father that he is getting married, but to the daughter of a conservative Senator. The comedy of errors that ensues has to be seen to be believed, and in my mind was as funny as the original. Robin Williams was very effective in playing the ""straight"" man to Nathan Lane's hysterical queen, and both played off of each other very well. Gene Hackman was also pretty hilarious as a stereotypically backwards-minded right-winger. Overall, while a remake of LA CAGE AUX FOLLES might not have been necessary, THE BIRDCAGE is pretty funny, if a little long-winded in parts. It has a great cast who all perform very well together, with special mention going to Hank Azaria as Armand and Albert's butler Agador. It also had a fine soundtrack as well. Bottom line: Robin Williams fans should enjoy this, as long as the satirical jabs at Republicans don't offend them, and fans of the French original should find plenty to like here as well.",The Birdcage

Own by a few non-straight men, and performed by numerous women impersonators.The owner of the BirdCage has a son(who's born straight) who is planning to marry this girl from the upper state. And is looking forward to having her as his wife. She's completely aware about his family being gay. Only problem is she's the daughter of a politician who's against the gay society. And before the 2 families meet, they must find a way to hide their nature from them so that way the 2 youngsters' marriage won't get ruined.I expected this movie would be about recreating a stage theater, judging by the cover. But I was completely surprised by what it really is about. I admit that it's funny for a straight forward comedy but it's not really a must buy to own on DVD. I wouldn't mind seeing it again.Just know that you should rent it first before thinking about buying it. Cause I don't think it's for everyone's enjoyment.",The Birdcage

The story is about a gay night club owner who's son comes to he to tell him that he is getting married, no problem there you may think but the major snag is that the girl's parents are very conservative and are anti gay. The insuing first meeting turns out to be very funny indeed especially when the conservative father meets the mother (Nathan Lane in drag) and the man servant,Agador Hercules, both of who are as camp as a row of pink tents!

I'm not gay and so am not that familiar with the issues facing gay people. This film is a pretty even-handed treatment of both gays and straights and I ended up enjoying the film pretty much. The acting is very good throughout and it turned out to be fun. It's also not judgmental, which is a definite plus. It stars Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman and Calista Flockhart. Williams and Lane are homosexual lovers who must go ""straight"" long enough to convince a Senator (Hackman) and his family that they are straight. The film has a good deal of humor in it without poking fun at anyone in particular - the humor is handled in a non-prejudicial manner.

45,raymond-15,Not as good as the French original,7,19 November 2001,"It's a situation comedy reminiscent of Charley's Aunt and equally as funny. In both scripts a man impersonates a woman in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion to an important event.  The results are side-splitting.   Nathan Lane has the plum part as the flamboyant petulant drag queen (Albert) while Robin Williams as his partner Armand manages to maintain some credulity in otherwise outrageous and complicated situations.   The story bounces along at a nice speed. but tends to sag when Armand meets his ex-wife in her office and they do a little song and dance routine.  I didn't see much point in that.    Of course the story climaxes in the dinner party scene when the two families come together in the apartment above the Birdcage Night Club. Ostensibly all erotic statues, paintings. carvings and other paraphernalia have been removed prior to dinner to create the right impression, but somehow or other the porcelain soup bowls decorated with men in erotic poses seem to have been overlooked and the patterns are quickly covered over in a frantic serving of chowder.   The scene in which everybody joins in singing ""I could have danced all night"" is a high spot and their friend who acts as the butler for the night has a lovely comedy role as he stumbles about because he is not used to wearing shoes.   Earlier in the film Armand tries to teach Albert how to sit, walk and act like a man.   It's an hilarious situation....an impossibility for Albert who is so steeped in his effeminate mannerisms.   All in all an enjoyable presentation, but I have the feeling the original French version which I saw many years ago had more excitement in it and the farcical situations much more humorous.",The Birdcage

Let's not forget about Lane and Azaria, who both deliver just as many (if not more) laughs and memorable quotes as the rest of the terrific cast. Although a bit stereotypical at times, it is ultimately a very well-rounded comedy that was ahead of its time. Much of this outing is skin-deep, with a somewhat questionable backstory between Williams and Baranski, but its charm and fun make any flaws you might find quite forgivable.*** (out of four)",The Birdcage

The laughs quit and the viewer goes quiet and we're given more of a totally biased, partisan-programmed social commentary on who the good guys are and who the bad guys are rather than a proper conclusion to a story and film that seem proper to begin with, a notion totally disproved by the final act.

How wrong I was, as this is one of the worst films ever. A teenage-boy is in love with a girl, and the girl is in love with the boy. There is one problem though, the father of the girl is a very conservative senator, and the father of the boy is gay+the owner of the Birdcage club. From there on, it`s easy to guess what is going to happen, and the fact that it`s filled with poor acting, is not exactly helping. One positive thing though: the senator is played by Gene Hackman, who acts good as usual.  Hackman is the reason why I don`t give this movie the lowest score. 2/10",The Birdcage
52,SKG-2,Dated farce,5,19 March 1999,"Of all the types of comedy, it seems to me farce has dated the most, and unless you inject it with something fresh, it doesn't work well.  The original movie,  LA CAGE AUX FOLLES, was no great shakes, but it didn't feel dated like this one does.  The scene which sums it all up is the scene where Armand (Robin Williams) is trying to teach Albert (Nathan Lane), his lover, how to act like a man (Albert is supposedly a transvestite, but except when he's performing, he looks more like a couch).  This has the best dialogue (when Armand pretends to be a football fan asking Albert how he felt about a bad play; Albert; ""How do you think I felt?  Bewildered, betrayed...wrong response?"" Armand; ""I'm not sure.""), but also a telling scene when Albert tries to walk like a man, and asks Armand, ""Too swishy?""The entire movie is too swishy, and the worst offender by far is Nathan Lane, whose performance screams, ""LOOK MA, I'M ACTING!""  Robin Williams, in a more subdued role, is pretty good as Armand.  Gene Hackman, as the conservative senator, doesn't go over-the-top performance wise, but he makes his character into little more than a joke.

55,nobbytatoes,great entertainment,7,4 August 2006,"Armand owns a drag nightclub in South Beach. The star of the show is his male partner Albert. Visiting his parents, Val announces that he his engaged to Barbara. Val and Barbara arrange for their parents to meet, yet there lies the dilemma. Barbara's father, Kevin Keeley is a senator and leader of the coalition for moral order; looking down upon gays, blacks, prostitutes and other people seen inferior. Adding to Kevin's problems, his co founder died in the bed of a black, minor prostitute. Louise Keeley see's this meeting of Val's parents and the marriage as a ploy to blow this scandal away; unaware that Val's parents are gay.Based upon the french play La Cage Aux Folles, The Birdcage is a clash of cultures; conservative right winged people crashing into the flamboyant gay culture. Under the surface of this straight forward comedy, there are messages to be found and explored; acceptance, knowing ones self, degradation, but they are only subtly touched upon. Director Mike Nichols doesn't take the path of conveying a message, taking a non serious path. Though it's the non serious nature Nichols takes that makes The Birdcage all the easier to enjoy; not having a message of accepting others being forced upon you.Though why try pound a message into the viewer when you have such a witty script. While to many cooks spoil the broth, with a total of five people having worked on the script, there is so much wit and references to politicians, historical figures, while taking a satirical stab at homosexuals and right winged conservatives. The characters are stereotypes; the gay's are really gay, the conservatives are stiff and wooden, but they aren't two dimensional. All the characters start off as clichés, though as time passes they shed the clichés becoming more developed.What makes the Birdcage so great is the perfect casting. Robin Williams shows he can do more centered comedy role. Nathan Lane is amazing as Albert, knowing just how far to push the over the top antiques without becoming a caricature. Gene Hackman does a great dead pan as Kevin Keeley. Dianne Wiest offset Hackman well as Louise. Hank Azaria does one of his best performance as Agador, its hard not to laugh when he enters the scene.With rapid fire comedy, The Birdcage never falls flat. Great entertainment.",The Birdcage

Armand (Williams) runs the Birdcage, a lush and colorfully bright drag club that's located in Miami's South Beach while Albert (Lane) is Starina, the club's star entertainer who can be hard to get along with off the stage.
The relationship that Albert and Armand have is pushed to the edge when Armand's son, Val (Dan Futterman) comes home and immediately tells Armand that he's getting married to an ""actual"" girl named Barbara (Calista Flockhart).  Plus, Val adds that a career-obsessed Senator (Gene Hackman) and an honest wife (Dianne Wiest) are Barbara's parents who are coming to Miami to meet Val's parents.Director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Elaine May made the best move to stick to the original story, but throw in a few punchlines here and there. May weaves a delightful good comedy that tries to be politically correct and nearly overdoes it in the film's second half.

The leads were seasoned actors and actresses. Mike Nichols was directing. I'm a tremendous fan of the original movie, for which this is based, LA CAGE AUX FOLLES (1978). I knew that the original stars (Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault) and their solid interpretations of the two main characters would be hard to compete with. Perhaps, Robin Williams and Nathan Lane would put a newer spin, without carbon copying. I was very curious. That is, until I watched this movie.The premise and execution are pleasant enough, don't get me wrong. There are some truly funny moments (keyword: moments) that were inspiring slices of comedy. The startling majority of the film is almost scene for scene, copied after the original. Did the screenplay take more than ten minutes to write? This is not exactly original stuff, except for a few flourishes here and there. All in all, a pretty mediocre affair. It's nowhere near as bold or innovative as the 1978 release (certainly not for its time, that's for sure). Also, given today's more enlightened views on gay people, the crux of the plot is starting to seem anachronistic, which certainly isn't a bad thing.

The story centers around a gay father's son marrying the daughter of a right wing Senator.

It's over the top and silly, but funny and enlightening in a way. What would happen if the daughter of a Republican Senator who was part of some sort of conservative coalition was marrying a man who's father is gay and lives with a cross dressing diva. That's the setup of The Birdcage, an Americanized version of the French film La Cage Aux Folles, and becomes a fun look at how some members of the gay community have to try to straighten themselves out in the right circumstances, and how difficult that really is. Robin Williams plays Armand Goldman, a Jewish gay man who had a one-night stand with Christine Baranski (he just wanted to know what all the fuss was about) and had a son, Val (played by Dan Futterman). Futterman's performance is a highlight in the movie, an understated, confused role that carries the sanity in the movie. Armand lives with Albert, who's stage name is ""Starina,"" played perfectly by Nathan Lane. The shrieks, the clothes, so much over the top comes from Lane's character that it's hard not to laugh. Val comes home, as he's about to marry his girlfriend of I guess 45 minutes, both are extremely young, played by Calista Flockhart, before her Ally McBeal days. Her father is the conservative Senator, played with a self-important whimsy by Gene Hackman. The problems come from the big dinner where the parents finally meet, and the real mom is late. This means Albert needs to become Val's mother, and we find out all of that cross dressing was worth it. The manic action that takes place when they try to first turn Albert straight, then as a woman carries the movie. It is all setup through the first half of the film. The second half has all of the comedic fireworks and is what makes the film memorable. That, and Hank Azaria's character Spartacus, a flamboyant Greek housekeeper for Armand and Albert. Azaria has said he used his grandmother as a model for this role, and it shows through. Little jokes are what make the movie, so keep you ears open, and your toast un-pierced.",The Birdcage

The comedy really hits a homer in during the climatic dinner scene. It may not be one of my favourite Robin Williams films, but it is one of my favourite Williams characters.

The other actors play caricatures of their roles in the same silly, stilted and inauthentic way as Williams. Tedious, with only a couple of truly funny moments.

I know that there wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise, but in the French film, I don't remember the son being that much of a baby.  The film, itself, is an exercise in predictability.  I'm a fan of farce but when it is this labored and unfunny, it can become tiresome.  I have never quite got Mike Nichols' films, so that may have something to do with it and I think that Robin Williams is vastly overrated as an actor and I think that also has a lot to do with the fact that I don't like this film.",The Birdcage

71,ijonesiii,A Warm and Hilarious Comedy...,8,22 December 2005,"THE BIRDCAGE is the hysterically entertaining Americanized version of the French classic LA CAGE AUX FOLLES. In this version Robin Williams plays the gay owner of a Florida nightclub who learns his straight son (Dan Futterman) is coming home and is engaged to be married. Williams learns from his son that his fiancée's parents (Gene Hackman, Dianne Wiest) are straight-laced and ultra-conservative and will not be comfortable meeting his gay father or his even more flamboyant lover (Nathan Lane) and suggests Williams send Lane out of town while Hackman and Wiest are in town. Instead, Lane puts on his best drag and meets the parents as Williams' wife in one of the most hilarious dinner party scenes ever filmed. This film is chock full of sparkling dialogue and sharp performances. I also found it rather refreshing to see Robin Williams playing straight man to Lane, who along with Hank Azaria as their housekeeper, practically steal the film from everyone else in one of the most entertaining comedies of the 90's. And the sight of Gene Hackman in drag is something everyone must experience.",The Birdcage

73,annmason1,Proud of what?,8,2 August 2005,"In thinking through this movie, I struggled to recall one honest character. I believe it is Barbara's mother. She is straightforward to the point of naiveté. The other assorted crew are great though. I mean, if we were all like (I can't remember her name, she is so innocuous) well, then, we wouldn't have a movie or any color to the world, would we? The most dishonest of the lot is Armand. Watch the cigarette in his first scene with Albert in drag. Williams is obviously using it to symbolize that he is, in fact, hiding something from his life-partner, and that ""something"" is Rodrigo- note his eyes when he communicates with the waiter in the restaurant scene. I mention this because The Birdcage is about deceit, some funny, some not. It is about people trying to be what they aren't to please someone else and of course failing. Along the way, this film is a lot of fun. It is a sympathetic look at a life style most of us wouldn't otherwise see, and that's worth a lot.This is a great ensemble. Good actors, an excellent script, an interesting premise. A very very good film.But here's my question, after all is said and done, why does Armand tell Katherine at the end that ""we are very proud of him"" in reference to Val? While I understand Val's motives, why would a parent be proud of dishonesty, of plain stupidity inexpecting (no matter the outcome of one evening) that his father in law could be eternally fooled? Yes, I know, I know. It's all plot and notreal, but still, I would have scratched that line, as there is no supporting evidence that Val- the center of this tornado- is anything but selfish.That said, I like this film.",The Birdcage
74,gbrumburgh,Sacre bleau! Trés abysmal.,2,16 May 2001,"This blatantly mediocre 1996 remake of ""La Cage aux Folles"" has none of the charm and nuance of the French classic.  If you have NOT seen the original, there is a twinge of enjoyment to be found.  If you HAVE seen the original, this experience will be a total bust.Robin Williams (as Armand) admirably downplays his role as a gay cabaret owner who showcases his brittle other half (Albert) in nightly drag revues. In a role that would seem tailor-made for the larger-than-life talents of the usually impressive Nathan Lane, the actor instead comes off (surprisingly) unfunny and (not surprisingly) hammy, indulging himself in the `see-how-hilarious-I-am' school of comedy acting.  Lane's one-dimensional character merely comes off nasty and needy, while the relationship between the lovers seems forced and superficial.  Not once did I believe them as a couple.  The absolute lack of chemistry between these two comedy masters remains a mystery.Masquerading as a heterosexual pair (with Lane ending up in matronly drag) to appease Arnaud's straight son who wants to pass off his family as `straight' to his fiancee's parents, the film offers the stars endless comic possibilities.  The resulting series of mishaps sputters at every turn.As the fiancee's parents, Gene Hackman, in particular, betrays his serious character by going for obvious laughs, while Dianne Wiest, who has demonstrated her Academy Award talent as a farceur, looks lost and uncomfortable.  Dan Futterman and a pre-Ally McBeal Calista Flockhart are a cute enough young couple in love, and Hank Azaria as the flaming houseboy certainly has his moments prancing about.  Christine Baranski comes off grounded but basically ineffective as the boy's real mother who tries to help out.The sad truth is that the film has no truth...no heart...no joire de vivre. There is little place for this movie to go but down the tubes.  So PLEASE, PLEASE do yourself a favor and rent the 1978 French film from whence this mess came.  It is alternately hysterical and touching.  But, most importantly, rent the French version with subtitles for the full comic effect, NOT the atrociously-dubbed English version.Some Americanized versions of French films have not done badly (""Three Men and a Baby"" for one).  As for `The Birdcage,' avoid it like the guillotine!",The Birdcage

Not directly based on the original (but with a similar main plot) this version tells the story of a gay couple, Armand and Albert Goldman (Robin Williams and Nathan Lane--in a role he should have been Oscar-nominated for) who own a drag club along the Florida coastline with Lane playing drag as the star (aka ""Starina"") receive startling news from Williams' son, Val (Dan Futterman), that he is getting married to the daughter of a die-hard conservative narrow-minded couple (2-time Oscar winners Gene Hackman & Diane Wiest) who are still clinging to the family values and make a subtle hint about being against Jews . The daughter, Barbara, is portrayed by a pre-Alley McBeal Calista Flockhart and they are planning to come meet the Goldman's for dinner under the impression fabricated by Val and Barbara that their last name is COLEman instead of Goldman. Therefore, Armand and Val feel that they should play it straight but Albert is too obvious so he must be sent away. An attempt is made to invite Val's mother, Catherine (played perfectly by ""Sybil""'s Christine Baranski), to dinner and instead of sending Albert away he could pose as Val's uncle. Unfortunately, Catherine is stuck in traffic and can't make it on time so at the last minute, Albert suddenly appears dressed as Mrs. Coleman. To find out what happens you'll have to watch the film. The supporting cast is a riot (particularly Hank Azaria as the Goldman's ""maid"" Agador--a native of Gutatmala--another one who should have been nominated for an Oscar). You have got to see this film. It is one side-splitting flick.",The Birdcage

Call it my guilty pleasure, if you might, call it the gayest movie ever made. Whoever you are and wherever you come from, you will pee yourself watching it. There are no faults to the movie whatsoever. The storyline, even though a bit too original, doesn't make you doubt anything. You have to love the characters, the warm, funny couple of gays with their oh-so-gay maid, with their straight 'son' and his very own Calista Flockhart as his wife-to-be, her very Republican parents and the ex-wife in the middle of everything.

84,minnow-6,"Gene Hackman, in drag, singing `We Are Family' has to be one of the funnier moments in movies",8,27 July 2000,"`Birdcage, The' ***1/2.  (1996, USA, R, 117 min. Directed by Mike Nichols with Robin Williams, Gene Hackman, Nathan Lane, Dianne Wiest, Dan Futterman, Calista Flockhart, Hank Azaria). Val (Dan Futterman) and Barbara (Calista Flockhart) are college students.  They're in love and are going to get married.  But first they have to go home and announce their intentions to their parents.  Barbara's parents are Senator and Mrs. Kevin Keele (Hackman and Wiest).  Val's parents are Armand and Albert Goldman (Williams and Lane).  Senator Keele is cofounder of the Committee for Moral Order and running for reelection on a right wing political ticket.  Armand is the owner of a drag queen nightclub in South Beach, Florida.  The star of the nightclub is Sabrina/Albert, Armand's significant other. With this stage set, Val and Barbara plan to have their parents meet and plan the wedding.  Of course Barbara can't tell her parents the truth about Armand and Albert. So Barbara tells her parents that Armand is a cultural attaché to Greece and his mom is a housewife.  Val has to ask his dad to send Albert away for the weekend and play it straight for the family dinner. Of course, nothing goes as planned.  The results are a very funny movie. But, the real fun in watching `The Birdcage' is the acting. Robin Williams is the straight man.  Remember he's playing a 50-year old, gay owner of a drag queen nightclub and father of the groom. Williams never misses a beat.  One minute he's trying to keep the peace between Sabrina and a gum chewing toy-boy as they practice the next night's show and the next he's an understanding father to his 20-year old son. Lane plays the stereotypical gay drag queen perfectly.  And when he has to step up and be Val's politically conservative, housewife mom it's wonderful.  Senator Keele never suspects for a moment that he's dancing with a woman.  Azaria does a half Lucy, half Ricky butler/maid that's great. But the prize goes to Hackman.  As a rightwing politician he didn't break any new ground but when Senator Keele has to mingle with the drag queen crowd to avoid being caught on camera in South Beach, he is funny.  Gene Hackman, in drag, singing `We Are Family' has to be one of the funnier moments in movies.  `The Birdcage is available on video.  Rent it for a really good time at the movies.",The Birdcage
85,anoceanroars,Not quite there...,5,12 March 2012,"The Birdcage is a remake of a French film which i might have seen, but was too young, so i will check it soon. i am almost willing to bet that as usual with remakes of foreign films Hollywood fails. Perhaps they should promote the actual original films to the American audience, but i suppose the average American (not an intentional jab at American, since i have seen it around the world) will not watch a subtitled film.The story is about Armand, a gay man (Robin Williams) that owns a drag nightclub, in which his lover (Nathan Lane) performs as the starring act. The couple raised a son together for 20 years. The 20 year old son is now wanting to get married, but there are some complications, which make for a few hilarious moments, but only a few.i love the cast of this film, especially Robin Williams. When he is left to his own devices he can be brilliant or over the top, so he really needs a great director that allows him more room to fly, but a leash to pull him back to our atmosphere. This director held the leash too tightly, so Robin never quite got there. Nathan Lane steals most of the thunder from Robin, but he is a little over the top at times. Hank Azaria is brilliant as Agador the houseman. The cast is great, except Calista Flockhart seems a little drab in this film.If you have not watched it, then i recommended that you see it once, but keep an open mind, after all it is about a gay family. i gave it 5/10 because it does not hold up as well as it did in 1996 and the film as a whole was just not quite there.",The Birdcage

The facial expressions and body gestures were unbelievably funny. I laughed harder than when I saw ""Young Frankenstein"" for the first time years ago. I never thought I'd see another movie that would literally have me laughing so hard that tears were running down my cheek. The fact that Robin Williams and Gene Hackman were cast seemed a bit strange to me when I first saw the names of the cast, but they were perfect for the characters they portrayed. One of the most classic examples of the wit and genius performed in this film was when Diane Wiest looks at Gene Hackman when he's saying what a fine ""lady"" Nathan Lane is, and he's playing a Republican Senator! I would have given the writer and all the actors an Academy for this picture. Hopefully, people will see it for what it is...pure comedic genius at work! Just relax and have fun with it. Don't try to read anything into it that you may think was NOT intentional because it was ALL intentional with extremely dramatic performances, and you know that the cast had a great time making it.You can even see Robin Williams starting to crack up when his ""male maid"" (Agador) is trying to toss the shrimp into his stew concoction!

91,jasonshaw-331-946707,Delightful Fun,8,19 December 2012,"￼Put simply this is a glitzy, colourful, modern remake of La Cage aux Folles in which Robin Williams stars as the hairy and sweaty Armand, South Beach drag club owner alongside the incomparable Nathan Lane as the star and Armund's lover and partner Albert.Just like the original version, their lives are turned upside down and inside out when Armund's son, Val, comes home to announce he is getting married to an ultra-conservative senator's daughter called Barbara. Everything goes haywire and speeds up to comic high gear when those future in-laws come down to meet their daughters intended and his family. Scandal is what the senator wants to avoid at the great cost, you cannot blame him, and his co-founder of the coalition for moral order partnership has just been found dead in the bed of an underage black prostitute. There are laughs a plenty when first Armund and then Albert try and play it butch, they desperately need a woman and it's so not often you hear a couple of middle aged gay men scream that! In steps the wonderful and delightful Christine Baranski who always lights up the screen with a presence that is electrifying. However, is life that simple, that easy? You bet your sweet little arse it ain't!Barbara tells her parents that Armand is a cultural attaché to Greece, whilst Albert is a housewife, and that they divide their time between Greece and Florida. It is only a little white lie really, just as changing their last name from Goldman to Coleman is. The evening of the meeting arrives, the apartment above the drag club is transformed from gay paradise to near austere monastery, Val's real mother, Katherine (Baranski) is held up by traffic and a boat and out pops Albert as a wonderful creation of freakishly good yet awfully bad middle-aged mother. Armand and Val are both horrified at first but have no option to go along with the façade, which for some bizarre reason in this movie world works. More jokes, no proper meal and the most amazing china dinner service of naked boys playing leap- frog and still the senator and his wife do not catch on. Until that is at the door arrives Katherine, introducing herself as Val's mother and the whole charade is shot to pieces, just as TV news crews arrive out frontHow on earth can the senator and his wife leave the drag club without some kind of mass scandal erupting and ending his political career? The answer is simple, drag up and we are treated to the wonderful scene of Gene Hackman in a dress making the late great Bea Arthur look as feminine as a virginal princess. It is a great feel good movie, full of lightness, the jokes and funny situation fire by in rapid succession that you will probably not catch them all on the first viewing. Robin William's is superb as the nightclub owner even if he does sweat profusely at times and almost cracks up completely in the kitchen scene with the houseman come butler. I adore Nathan Lane, with his scene stealing 'Starina' performance and utter camp flamboyant majesty. Gene Hackman is equally good as the chocolate addicted extreme right wing senator with his sour face and dry delivery. As a modern re-make of a seventies classic it is both successful and complimentary, it also stands up on its own, which is a jolly good job, and for I am sure, the vast majority of its audience would not have seen La Cage aux Folles. Sure, it is lightweight, sure, it plays a little to stereotype, but it goes beyond them, reaching in to the human side and honest inner core aspect admirably. It is outrageously camp, unashamedly so, blatantly exotic and wonderfully charming, a great feel good movie.

I also love the part where Agador dances to ""Conga"" by Gloria Estefan in the kitchen, but I love all the scenes in this movie.But overall, this is a hilarious movie and also my favorite movie. Great job, Mike Nichols!",The Birdcage
106,Green_Lump,"wasn't bad, I love Robbie Williams, but an Oscar-nominee, REALLY?",5,28 June 2010,"the film was watchable, although I have skipped some scenes, the film anyhow did not have any wisdom, intelligence or ingeniousness AT ALL ! It shouldn't even be close to the Oscar nominations, just a gay club, a gay couple, and their son who wants to get marry his girlfriend and they end up getting married, it's one of these simple-happy-ending movies that deserve 5 out of 10 MAX ! I am still shocked that it was nominated for an Oscar that time, what the hell were they thinking? still I would never say 'never watch this film' it was not that bad of a film, but I wouldn't suggest it to anyone, 4 out of 10 seems very reasonable to me,",The Birdcage

108,twilight2000,This is one of the best send ups I've seen!,10,13 July 2003,"Some Spoilers Contained...
While an old story, it's beautifully done by Robin Williams and Nathan Lane who are hilarious in this complete remake of La Cage (finally saw the original French flick -- good work -- but VERY French and not designed to be particularly funny -- the comedic bits are much more subtle and quiet and the desperation much more pronounced...)  Gene Hackman does a grand job as the uptight father of the girl who's fallen in love with Robin and Nathan's son.  The small role by Christine Baranski is fun, Diane Wiest is perfect in her role as well.  The unexpected scene stealer (if you can imagine *anyone* stealing a scene from either Robin or Nathan) is  Hank Azaria as Agador Spartacus, the ""house boy"".This is Robin and Nathan at their best -- and the cast that surrounds them stands up to the demand for wonderful performances as well.If you like this, I suspect you'll also like the comedic (but more poignant) To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar!Kick back and enjoy this one -- and you'll never look at ""We Are Family"" the same EVER AGAIN!!!",The Birdcage
109,smiling-o,I laughed a lot at this one,7,4 February 2005,"Since I haven't seen the classic that came before this, I'm unable to compare it, or be biased by it.Robin Williams movies are always a pleasure to see. But, the over the top script for this one is hysterical. I'd imagine one has to be somewhat open minded to enjoy it. ;) Having many gay friends and having gone to many a party thrown by them, I can see it all taking place. And, the drama caused by a very feminine man playing a very straight woman in order to avoid coming out of the closet is too funny. That dinner scene is an absolute riot.The sad thing about it is knowing that so many have to hide their sexuality for fear of being ostracized. But, this puts such a humorous spin on things. It must have been a really fun movie to produce and/or act in. Rent it when you are in need of a laugh! :)",The Birdcage
110,jeepcj5guy,A truly underrated masterpiece of comedy,9,18 April 2008,"While I'm a little surprised this film is not rated higher, I'm also not surprised. Hands down, comedy is probably the most difficult film genre. It's so much harder to make people laugh, and laugh throughout the whole film, than it is to make a ""dramatic"" drama or an ""action-packed"" action movie. The Birdcage is one of my all-time favorite comedies, if not only for the great acting. Plus, it's the subtle nuances that really add to the film's brilliance, and I think these are overlooked.In my book, there may never be a better comedic combination than Williams and Lane (I'm sorry, but the Broderick/Lane combo in the Producers was nowhere near as complementary). The Williams/Lane cohesion in this movie is undeniable and the delivery of the dialogue is hilarious. Some people seem to be critical of the story's obvious clichés and overblown silliness; however, they have obviously missed the point  it's supposed to be clichéd and silly. Granted, without Williams and Lane, the movie wouldn't have made so much as a blip on the radar. But toss in the added bonus of Hank Azaria's Agador and Hackman's obvious presence, and you've got comedic gold.""Oh I see, so you're going to a cemetery with your toothbrush. How Egyptian.""",The Birdcage

114,flwerpwered,A dated look at a gay relationship - a cisgender perspective,5,16 November 2020,"First let me preface this with a bit of a bio. I am a middle aged straight cis gender female ally of the LGBTQ+ community. Not terribly outspoken, but definitely supportive.Now, a couple of weeks ago myself and my mother (who I will just say has qualified for AARP for a while) decided we wanted to watch a movie. This always presents the dilemma of finding something for both our tastes. We finally settled on a comedy and selected The Birdcage. We had both seen it previously, but it had been about twenty years.The movie was good with both Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in fine form. I must say also that Hank Azaria never receives the due he should in this for the small but hilarious role of Agador. Some of my favorite one liners come from him.The movie finished out our night and I was left pondering it. I found that this movie, one of my favorites, actually hadn't aged well. Through no fault of the producer or actors, this movie I feel is showing a distinctive view of the way a stereotypical gay couple was viewed and portrayed by Hollywood in the mid 90s. Things have changed a lot in 25 years. Perhaps this is not dissimilar to the way some people are now viewing Gone With The Wind, with even more time in perspective.In the movie, Nathan's character, Albert, is shown as being the obviously feminine half of the relationship and the joke is made about how to tell 'who the mother is'. This implies that there should be a feminine half. Obviously we now know different. Of course this is placed within the culture of drag queens, but still. Albert is constantly portrayed as moody and simpering, almost as a woman from an old style Hollywood movie would be. Unfortunately, while watching what was once one of my favorite films, I found the portrayal sad.In the end, the Birdcage redeems itself a bit by showing Robin's character, Armand, standing up for his partner and of course everything has a nice Hollywood ending. The movie I suppose remains as a time capsule display of where views on gay relationships have been not too long ago. As for me, I don't think I'll watch again soon.",The Birdcage

Yes, Robin Williams is great in everything. Gene Hackman, is great is everything. But you put these two in a movie together and they do an incredible job of sharing the spot light. Each character has a memorable line, and an amazing interaction with the two flag ship actors. But Hank Azaria steals the show hands down. He is so funny in this movie, that I would watch a solo movie based on his character. I would really like to see a cooking show with Agador at some point. looking at you Netflix.You can't talk about how funny everyone is in this movie without mentioning the set designs. The sets, give so many opportunities to the actors to just explore their characters. Every shot of the club is fantastic! I feel like I'm watching a drag show every time it comes on the screen. Not to mention the apartments transformation from gay couples home, to boring drab pad is sensational.I have to talk about the direction as well. Working with an A-list cast means you have to let them run with their instincts, and that's exactly what happened. Not to say everything wasn't planned, but I'm sure half of what Robin said was not scripted, or Nathan for that matter.The BAD: I'm not sure what the cinematographer was thanking for a few of the shots. It looks like the lens is just fuzzy. I understand he's trying to convey the scene that this takes place in Florida, but when is Florida fuzzy? The costume designer already conveyed the message by putting everyone is a Pepsi commercial from the 1980's.The ending is left open with no idea whether or not the senator approves of his new family. We also don't get much of a reaction from Katherine, who is presumably seeing her son for the first time. She had more of a reaction when she saw Aramand for the first time in 20 years. Val also doesn't have a real reaction to meeting his birth mother for the first time, other then to just point out the huge sacrifice his parents are making by putting on this facade for the senator.But the worst thing by a mile is the plan its self. You mean to tell me they couldn't just reschedule the meeting of the parents? If they did they could of had more time to either train Albert to be a man, or make the house ""straighter"". Even the senator could of had more time to deal with his campaign issues. A simple phone call and apology to say, ""I'm so sorry we wont be able to make it this weekend to meet you. Things just took a major nose dive this week and I must stay here to clean up the mess.""

This is the movie you can play and relax, it will surely put you in the pinks of your health. Uplift your mood and put a smile on your face.
First of all,
The casting of this movie is amazing, Robin Williams and Gene Hackman, the two Hollywood giants, albeit in two contrasting roles, one being an owner of a drag queen (read gay) nightclub, Armand Goldman and the other being a conservative, co-founder of the Committee for a Moral Order, as Senator Keele.
Second of all,
the movie has enough laughs & satirical punches to crack a pot. It's hilarious & puts you in that feel-good mood.
I cannot help but give a special mention to Nathan Lane, who plays Starina, Armand's homosexual partner and the star of the nightclub ""The Birdcage"" played by Nathan Lane. I was actually surprised he was not even nominated for the ""Best Actor in Supporting Role"" category of the Academy Awards.
Lastly to state the obvious, Robin Williams, the Genius, just never ceases to amaze. He plays any role you give him with utmost perfection and dexterity. He's one of a generation artist and the one the Hollywood and the Cinema will miss for ages to come.",The Birdcage

The son in the Birdcage is a much more complex character than the one in La Cage, and a lot of the movie is about him accepting his identity. The daughter, on the other hand, is much more of a three dimensional character in La Cage.The other nice thing about this movie is that unlike in the original, you end up liking the girls parents to some extent.

As Armonf, Robin Williams' timing is so on point he was made for this part. Hank Azaria plays the house maid Agadot and is the gem of the trio. His accent is endearing and unwavering. Every scene Azaria is in he shines. The film does not exploit the gay aspect of the plot, it's respectful and admirable. Mike Nichols really won out on this one. His best work. The story flows smoothly with a distinguished sweetness. The premise if the movie is of a young man Val, telling his gay parents, Armand and Albert, that he wants to marry the daughter of a high profile politician.

Anyone watching it cannot deny the obvious on-screen chemistry between Robin and Nathan. Their delivery reminds us that relationship is a universal category, with same rules applying to anyone involved regardless of their orientation. Love, friendship, support, warmth. Beautiful.

143,ludvique,An hysterical comedy on speed,10,15 May 2006,"This film is delightfully light at heart, but with fantastic achievements in front of the camera. Especially Nathan Lane impresses here, with one of the funniest and believable achievements in the history of comedy. He alone makes the film worthwhile; although splendid achievements from his fellow actors are on top of the shelf. Simply hysterical.Cut short this film is about a young couple and their love. Naturally they want to get married, and her parents is in dire need of a good, ethical story to give to the media because her father's political career is in still water after some sex-scandals surrounding his own staff. They are destined in for a shock when they meet their future son-in-law's family; 100% gay drag/cabaret-artists... The fun really starts when they decide to act as if they are a heterosexual family. The young man's father can just be a little more macho than he usually he is, and that's a rap. However, he lack a female partner - hence the Nathan Lanes-how is on wheel: A fat, 100% feminine and gay man has to be converted into this very puritan solid ""woman""... Can't happen, can it?",The Birdcage
144,PostTime,Extremely over rated!,1,16 September 2000,"Comedy is one of my favorite formats and I have a wide range of tastes in that genre.  I watched this film because of the actors involved and because of all the ""Rage"" made about the film.I found this film to be boring, very unclever and full of too much tired old schtick.  I kept shaking my head wondering when something creative and funny was going to happen.By the end I figured that the film wasn't glorified because it was a good movie, but because of it's message.  Whatever.  Couldn't they have done that with good writing and new ideas?  <<Yawn>>",The Birdcage

146,thedeathofanera,It's for the laughs!,9,8 August 2001,"Okay, so here we have Nathan Lane, Robin Williams, Gene Hackman, and Hank Azaria all in a movie about a gay couple in Miami who have to play it straight for one night. Sound funny? Well...it is! It pokes fun at Republicans, drag queens, and just how the way people can act under pressure. It's got a lot of funny lines and the roles are played fantastically by all that actors and actresses. Williams and Lane's delivery/timing together is impeccable and Nathan Lane plays a hilarious role as the over-the-top drag queen.My favorite character in this film however, is ""Agador"", the gay servant played by Hank Azaria. Hank is one of those actors that I really wish was a lot better well known then he truly is. He's a fantastic actor and he can do great voices/impressions. Most of you would know him as about half the population of a town called Springfield in a little show called ""The Simpsons."" Anyone ever heard of it?So anyway, all in all I've got one question left to ask, ""Do you feel like laughing?"" Because if you do want to laugh at a silly movie with a lot of great actors and funny roles, give it a try! This film has been called ""dated"" on more then one occasion, I agree to an extent. I mean, the extremely sensative drag queen role has been done a few too many times, but Nathan Lane gives it a whole new hilarious feel. Enjoy!-JON!",The Birdcage

149,Laurie_Deane,Hilarious.,10,25 April 2003,"I have seen this film four or five times now (one of the benefits of having ITV2) yet it still remains one of my favourites. Now I conceed that it is hardly Shakespeare and probably shouldn't win any awards (mind you, if Chicago can...) , but it is very funny and has an excellent cast. Nathan Lane is great in everything he does and this role suits him perfectly. Without giving too much away, there is a great scene with a pair of pink socks and an interesting John Wayne impersonation. Robin Williams shows why he is a comic genius and Dan Futterman is great to watch as his son, just longing for a 'normal' family. Hank Azaria (voice of Moe Syslak and Apu Nahasapeemapetilan) delivers a wonderful performance as Agador Spartacus, the Guatemalan maid. He has trouble with his shoes, they make him fall down. Gene Hackman and Diane Weiss are great as the conservative Americans this film is mocking. He calls Margaret Thatcher a wonderful woman, now that deserves mockery. His rambling speech about the foliage in 'our wonderful country' is great - trust me.In short, this is an amazing movie from start to finish and if you enjoy farce, you should give it some of your time.",The Birdcage
150,Koteas1,One of the best comedies ever made,10,5 August 2005,"First off; I can understand why people would dislike this movie; The characters are all portrayed in an extremely stereotypical way, the acting is considerably over the top most of the time, the story is rather cheesy and not very believable - I mean which gay couple would (or COULD) transform their eccentric home into a monastery-like environment in 24 hours to pretend to be a cultured family to impress the son's fiancée's parents?...Yet I couldn't stop laughing all the way through, even after the 10th time. Why? It's BECAUSE the characters are so stereotypical, it's BECAUSE the acting is over the top, it's BECAUSE the whole thing is so unbelievable that it makes it scintillating to behold. Even though the characters are stereotypical, the script has obviously been written by someone who doesn't intend to contribute to the stereotypical view of the gay drag community, but who rather wanted to create characters that are lovable while at the same time shouting ""don't take us seriously"". This isn't a movie portraying life in the gay society; and everyone who expects realistic (and hence probably rather unfunny) portrayal of such a theme is better off NOT watching a comedy featuring gays (don't most comedies thrive on making the stereotype seem funny?) It may not be politically correct all the way, but hey; society's too hung up on all this political correctness as it is,. The characters in this movie were lovable, perhaps BECAUSE they were stereotypical depictions. However they're brought to life so well by the actors playing them that it doesn't make you shake your head in frustration over yet ANOTHER movie portraying stereotypes, but rather makes you shake your head in laughter over the deadpan things they say and do, which are so obviously unreal at times that anyone who thinks this movie will promote a false picture of the gay community needs a reality check. The script is amazing, and even though it may really be too over the top once in a while, it doesn't distract from the overall picture. The story isn't much; the focus on details is what makes this movie funny. Little gestures, frowns, face expressions and little subtleties make this movie one of the best comedies I have ever watched, and probably one of the best comedies I will ever be fortunate enough to see in my entire life. Contrary to what it may seem like at first sight, the humor is overly refined without being intellectual, instead of jumping in your face all the time.What's more, the cast is great. Both Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are very fine comedians who have the touch it takes to play a role like this one. They make over-the-top stereotypes actually FUNNY, instead of just laughable.And yes, I HAVE seen the original movie, not all too long ago actually, and I have to say the remake is twenty to the power of 99 times better than the original. I barely laughed, and the original version was in my eyes an utterly forgettable movie. And that coming from a person who usually hates remakes. This movie gives the original ""Birdcage"" a fresh new shine and transports the story into the 90's. Well made, on all accounts, I can't think of a single criticism!",The Birdcage

She only said she heard it was a good movie.However comedy is fickle; a person's mood can have a strong influence on whether they enjoy a comedy, and I was not starting the movie with a good mood.By the end, I loved it! It was not only humorous, but it portrayed the gay men in a realistic manner: men who have a great capacity for love, yet are victims of prejudice.You have to respect Robin Williams for playing this role, especially in the era this was made. He risked his career by taking on a role many Americans would object to, as this film was made well before the time when the majority of Americans decided that prejudice against gays and lesbians is wrong.The film does struggle with stereotypes, but overall, great acting and writing make it a gem of a film.",The Birdcage

Oh my goodness gracious, this movie just really leaves you gasping for breath because you can't stop laughing.Past the ""Fosse, Fossees"" and ""John Wayne imitations"", this movie can be seen in a deeper level. It addresses the controversial topic of homosexuality and how people who are gay or lesbian are just like any other people. Nathan Lane plays the part of a woman so well that I still find myself forgetting that SHE is a HE.The chemistry and interaction of the characters was played out so nice that the main message is clear. Amidst the sound of a nightclub, the first words the audience hears is ""We are family..."" This movie reminds people that no family is perfect.It shows the similarities between the contrasting serious and traditional family versus the lively, unorthodox family. Each family had its peculiarities and it shows the reality of family life. It is the love and genuine care for each other that makes up a family.",The Birdcage
157,musor2000,"Don't waste your time, go watch the original",1,4 January 2010,"Watching this movie after seeing the French original is like reading wikipedia summary after reading 'Romeo and Juliet'. Robin Williams as Armand is the only actor who is playing his role somewhat close to satisfactory. He can't quite match the charm and manners of Ugo Tognazzi, though. But Nathan Lane as Albert is a disaster. You can clearly see that he is a man occasionally trying to play a gay person. It's all in the makeup and even that does not always help. When he is rehearsing a song you can't tell he's gay at all. But if you look at Michel Serrault's original performance, it's nothing short of outstanding. Every movement, every expression tells you that he's a woman in man's body. Basically, a witty script and superb actors' play make me watch the 1978 ""La Cage Aux Folles"" original over and over, while bland adaptation with weak acting of ""The Birdcage"" spoils the brilliant script. I have no clue what was the point in making this remake. Replace french lawmaker with a senator? Just go get the original. Then you can watch this remake and see if you agree with me. (BTW, if you liked Schwarzenegger's ""True Lies"", you might want to watch the French original, ""La Totale"". They have the same plot, and, surprisingly, they are both good, just shot differently!)",The Birdcage
158,anniesrose,Great movie and VERY VERY funny!,10,24 April 2006,"This has got to be one of the funniest movies I have ever watched! Nathan Lane camps it up, Hank Azaria would have been funny even without Agador's 'heat', Gene Hackman plays a half-wit politician with such aplomb that he makes it almost serious! The 'girls' in the club were all too believable to be really men (even though I have seen one or two of them on Jerry Springer, I swear it!). However, nothing could have been accomplished without the hair-brained antics of Robin Williams! I really believe that he is a comic equal to the likes of Richard Pryor, Jerry Lewis and the ultimate Rodney Dangerfield. His frustration with Albert's moods and peccadilloes actually seemed real and Albert as 'Starina' showed that even a 'moderately good' drag show was great when the actors believe in it. I have seen Williams in so many movies but this has got to be one of the best!",The Birdcage
159,aceyroxx15,Absolutely Fabulous,10,6 July 2004,"This movie is one of the best. Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are phenomenal and hilarious, but the best performance throughout the film is by Hank Azaria, as Agador, the adorable flaming butler. My favorite scene is when both families are sitting together eating dinner. I don't want to give anything away, but wow I was in tears. Gene Hackman is extremely funny as a conservative senator. This film is colorful, unique and will keep an audience roaring with laughter. Yes, the movie follows some typical stereo types among a gay male couple, however, is not offensive in anyway, shape or form. I think this is such a cute film, and if you haven't seen it, or if you happen to be in the mood for a laugh out loud movie rent The Birdcage.My Rating: 9/10",The Birdcage

It lacked the subtlety that such a good premise offered - it was actually rather sad to see such talent wasted on reducing identifiable marginalized groups (incl. the poorly educated underage black female prostitute).
this is not funny.

161,ameet_t,Very entertaining!,10,6 February 2007,"I've watched this movie countless times and never get bored. It provides sheer entertainment and some of the best one-liners I've heard in a movie. It is equal opportunity in its derogatory remarks and racism, and that's part of the charm. People get too worked up over stereotypes and ""being offended"" but they shouldn't -- this is a movie, not a political commentary. The actors have done a superb job of creating humour out of an awkward situation -- two men who happen to be gay, live together, own a business and must ""play it straight"" for the benefit of their son's in-laws.I think I understand why the critical review has been mediocre -- it's likely because critics keep comparing 'The Birdcage' with the original 'La Cage Aux Folles'. I wish critics would rate a movie for what it is, and not for what it compares to. 'The Birdcage' as a stand-alone movie is witty, funny, silly, and entertaining. And that's what makes it so enjoyable! It's one of my favourite comedies and I can watch it over and over again.",The Birdcage

Robin Williams and both brilliant but of course it is Nathan Lane who runs away with the show as the cross-dressing screaming queen Albert. Combining cute family morals with overblown homosexuality and conservatism, the message in this is just as heartwarming as the script is witty and the performances are perfect. One highly notable scene is when Armand (Williams) is teaching Albert (Lane) how to act 'like a man'. Obviously there are hosts of other classic scenes that make The Birdcage stand out from all the rest of this day's junk. It puzzles me that over-long, usually unfunny sexual-humour based films like 'Forty Year Old Virgin' manage to pick up a 7.4 rating while Birdcage is stuck way below.

163,MaiGhost,An absolute hoot,10,1 November 2014,One of my all time favourites. The first time I saw it we were laughing so much we raised a friend out of her sickbed and watched it again back to back so she could see what all the fuss was about. It was every bit as enjoyable the second time.I have introduced the film to several people since and never tire of it. Beautifully pitched performances doing justice to a lovely piece of writing.Some prefer the 1978 original which I saw yesterday and did not really enjoy. It seems a strange word to use about the Birdcage but my feeling is that there is a subtlety to it which the 1978 La Cage aux Folles version lacks that brings out the charm and humour of the writing. (It could be that it was dubbing of the 1978 version that marred it for me).,The Birdcage
164,bzingostar,one of the funniest movies you'll see,9,8 February 2015,Don't believe all the pretentious snobs who want you to know that they've seen the french version. This is funny whether it's a copy or not. Nathan Lane and Hank Azaria are fantastic. They show it here on free to air about four times a year and it's hard not to watch it yet again. It's worth me watching just to hear my wife laughing her head off. I think those who criticise the movie as being insensitive are trying to take it too seriously when it's just meant to be a bit of fun. If it wasn't a comedy and gay people were portrayed this way then it might be offensive but it's a comedy and so there are stereotypes and the stereotypes are meant to be funny - not to be taken seriously.

169,phxsurf,"Fly, Be Free!",8,29 April 2006,"I have owned the DVD of ""The Birdcage"" since 1998. I decided to watch it today and, after all this time, I STILL love it! The film boasts quality comedic characterizations, tight editing, vibrant wonderful color and music that captures not only the tropical flavors of the Florida coast, but accents the hilarious gems of irony that run throughout the whole film.Sure, there are a few minor missteps in scripting and line delivery. But, it's ENTERTAINMENT . . . NOT a socio-political treatise on the evolving state of the human condition. Those who try to find profound philosophy in fanciful farce will only meet up with disappointment. Those who feel compelled to (or rather obsessed with) making ""play-by-play,"" nitpicking value comparisons of this remake to the original ""La Cage Aux Folles"" should lighten up. You might as well compare Little Women to Desperate Housewives . . . they just aren't meant to be mentioned in the same breath!I have watched the original AND the remake, and I can appreciate the merits and weaknesses of both. Each film expresses its own unique flavor and personality--playing off of and satirizing the popular contemporary cultural and historical context in which each was created . . . THAT is the attitude one should take when watching either of the films.Aside from that, I wonder if there is any way for MGM (or another production company) to produce an anniversary / collectors edition of The Birdcage? Hmmmm, perhaps they could include new special features such as:*Movie Commentary--Maybe an audio conversation with the directors, cast key crew members as they watch the film (With Robins Williams/Nathan Lane in the ""dish"" mix, it could really be a funny, unique feature).*Special Documentary--""Uncaging the Birdcage""--a look at what effect The Birdcage has had on film and society. How life/film has changed since the time The Birdcage was released. (maybe include interviews with film critics, social commentarists, reactions of old & young audience/film-goers).*Cast, Crew interviews--about the production, their own process of characterization, technical effects, etc.*Outtakes/Deleted Scenes--we've heard there are SO MANY hilarious ones. We are dying to see what they are!*Where Are They Now?--Bios of Cast, Crew, Director.*Trivia Game--Which happened in which film? (La Cage Aux Folles vs. The Birdcage)""The Birdcage"" earned more than $124 million in its theatrical release domestically, and over $61 million overseas. Not only is it a popular mainstay on various TV channels throughout the year (which means it must get a consistently good audience rating), but there is now widespread public acceptance of similar content in both film and TV.I am sure if whoever has the DVD copyright decides to make an anniversary / collector's edition of ""The Birdcage"", there will be many of us out here who would LOVE to buy it and recommend it.In the meantime, don't hold your breath. If you're thinking about watching The Birdcage now, then hop to it already. :) Get it, then kick back with some popcorn & a couple of margaritas.

Hackman steals the show in many ways. Once you see him made up in drag it's very hard to not think of him that way when you see him again, even in something like ""French Connection"" as a hard boiled cop. It's funny how many people let the fact that its about a gay couple who run and star in a drag club and show ruin the whole movie by lableing it a ""gay movie"". Some great lines - A newsman asking a black hooker who was with Sen. Jackson who has just died and who was the vice head of a ""moral majority"" political group with Sen. Keely (G. Hackman) as the head.  Sen. Jacksons last words according to the black hooker ""The moneies on the table sugar"".At the end its really a commentary on society. That we are really all alike in the end, and that no one should throw stones at others because your sins might just be as bad if not worse.A great seen at the end where Hackman, still dressed in wig and drag (used to get him out of the ckub swarming with media) tells his driver to ""meet me a few blocks down"".

They are perfect as the middle-aged gay couple!  Robin is fantastic!  Just the right combination of physical humor and, for Robin, rare understated delivery.  Nathan Lane...what can I say...no one else could have played this role.  I loved it!  I catch it every time it is on TV, I have the VHS, and today I purchased the DVD!  I give it two thumbs up!

Whoever masterminded this cast of actors knew what they were doing. The film pokes fun at both the absurdity of right wing Republicans and over the top gay men running a nightclub - all humor done very tastefully. For an evening of pure entertainment you've got to see this movies- more than once.",The Birdcage
180,Irishfrcrkr,English project-The Bird Cage,10,11 January 2005,"If this movie was so bad, then how come my 14 year old daughter found enough humor, symbol's, etc. etc. to take two weeks to compile an A+ project on this movie regarding self identity through family identity.She watched four other much more ""publicized"" and recent movies before deciding to stick with this movie for her project. Teacher said that she was the only who has, in his five years at our high school, chosen THe Bird Cage. Pretty amazing since our city has a higher per capita gay population than San Francisco! Just a proud mom rambling but she will tell you that this one of her 5 most favorite movies of all time and that my gay friends are some of the best people that she knows!Some people could really take a lesson from a child!",The Birdcage

YOU WILL LOVE IT. My personal favorites in the film are: (1) when Nathan Lane's character is getting ready to ""go on"" and is falling apart thinking that Robin Wm's character is having an affair and he says to Hank Azaria ""you look haggard""......lol (2) when they are rehearsing in the birdcage and Nathan Lane says ""HE IS CHEWING GUM""........or (3) when Nathan Lane's character is running away from home and says ""you all hate me, you all hate me"" I can't put it ALL down here, my mind is FLOODED with favorites, it is all great. (and I am hard to please with films)..........",The Birdcage
182,melosegars,a funny movie to watch more than once,10,14 March 2005,"I was taken back the first moments of the movie. I do not agree with this type of family arrangement. However, Robin Williams and Nathan Lane are such fantastic actors and comedians, I couldn't help but ""get into"" this movie. The movie has no boring moments. It is all about the antics of the gay couple ""trying"" to come up with a plan to appear ""straight"" to a family with a totally different agenda.I have watched this movie numerous times. I have the video tape and the DVD. Every time it appears on television, I have to watch. Just when I think my family gets a little too crazy, I always have ""The Birdcage"" to assure me all is well.I am a registered nurse and currently completing my Bachelor's Degree in Nursing. I have chosen this movie to write a research paper about families. After I complete the paper, I will post another comment.",The Birdcage
183,robfmdetroit,"I've given it three chances, and I still don't like it.",3,3 April 2017,"Let me preface this with two things:1. Unlike some other negative reviews I'm seeing here, my opinion of this movie has nothing to do with the subject matter.2. I have not seen the original French version.Maybe I just don't appreciate ""farce"", a term which everyone who loves this movie seems to insist on using to describe it.In my own terms, I'd describe this movie as battle-of-the-stereotypes trapped in a 95-minute long ""Three's Company"" episode--you're forced to watch as incredibly unreasonable and/or unrealistic decisions cause ""misunderstandings"" and ""wacky situations"" to pile up on each other, and you have to suffer through it all with uncomfortable anticipation because you know full well that at some point the paper-thin house of cards will all come crashing down. I find this kind of storytelling to be unbearable.I love(d) Robin Williams, and maybe I'm just accustomed to seeing him in other roles, but I just don't entirely buy him in this role. It's not that it's a bad performance, it just seems more like a straight person's circa-1996 interpretation of what being gay is. He's believable as a loving partner, and he's actually the straight man (pun alert!) of his coupling with Nathan Lane, but there's at least one moment that stands out like something from his stand-up act -- too over-the-top and almost mocking to be in character.Lane is grating. Again, another actor I like, but the character that he plays is so completely turned up to 11 at every moment--he's somehow loud, emotionally stunted, practically bipolar and a gentle snowflake all at the same time. Other reviews I've read here find him funny (I completely don't), but once again, I don't understand what's so funny about playing the character so unrealistically stereotypical. It also hurts the suspension of disbelief in Williams' character -- why would Williams' rather reasonable, down-to-earth character put up with Lane's character's nonsense?And, a note regarding stereotypes: I've noticed some other reviewers here citing the overdone stereotypes as the REASON it's funny, and I couldn't disagree more. Yes, stereotypes can absolutely be cleverly and successfully worked into comedy--I would argue that the underrated ""Undercover Brother"" proves that--but these characters, most notably Lane, are just so loud and in-your-face that you get to a point where you just want them to shut up.Another reviewer mentioned the son being a somewhat unlikeable character, and with the actions and demands he makes in the story, to that end, I agree. This is yet another casualty of this movie's disconnect from reality -- the son of a gay couple could never actually expect his parents to do what he's asking of them. Granted, it's probably because this movie is based on a relic of the late 70s, but still.Despite mostly hating this movie, the reason I'm giving it 3 out of 10 is because it has a COUPLE of bright spots. Hank Azaria has a few good moments as Lane and Williams clownish house boy, and there are a couple of random funny bits sprinkled here and there (Williams trying to teach Lane how to be less outwardly gay is pretty funny). Also, I love Christine Baranski--unfortunately, she kinda gets shafted on screen time (part of the build-up to the ""wackiness""). Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest are both fine actors and play their roles well, I just wish it was in the service of a better story.Bottom Line: I am a Mike Nichols fan, I like everyone in the cast, but I just don't see this movie as successful on any level. Maybe it just lost something in the translation from French.",The Birdcage
184,muratalis-1,One of best comedies!,9,26 November 2005,"I don't understand how a human being can give 1,2,3,4 or 5 as a vote to this movie! It's really interesting! It's possible that you don't like the subject of the movie, may be you hate homosexuals! I won't judge your thinking! But the acting in that movie was really unforgettable. If you consider only acting, this movie deserves 5 automatically! And then for other good things at this movie i don't think that it deserves less than 7!This movie was absolutely fabulous! I've watched many times, and still if i watch i am laughing! :) 9 Out Of 10",The Birdcage
185,sunderwoodmiller,"Love, love, love!!!!!!!!!!",10,19 August 2016,"I absolutely love this movie! I've watched it I don't know how many times. It makes me laugh and cry. It's a wonderful story of love and family. The cast is brilliant, the writing is inspired (""2 words -- green card"", ""I'm the only one not from a broken home."", ""It's porno, not pronto."" among others), the bits are extraordinary (Nathan Lane as John Wayne!!!). The characters have depth and interest. The costuming and sets, the historical setting, along with the supporting cast all contribute to the overall excellence of the movie. It doesn't really matter whether it's set in a drag bar, though, obviously, that adds a certain quirky element to the story. Who didn't love Hank Azaria's Guatamalaness?",The Birdcage
186,waeltijoslyn,Armand and partner Albert agree to feign being straight in order to fool their son's fiancée's conservative parents. This results in a downward spiral throughout the movie.,10,18 October 2016,"For many people The Birdcage would usually be quickly discarded due to the fact that it pokes fun at conservative politics. However, with a fabulous cast of Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, Hank Azaria, and Dianne Wiest, it's a hilarious remake of the French film, La Cage aux Folles. Robin Williams stars as a gay drag club owner, Armand Goldman, who's been in a long-term relationship with the club's feature performer, Albert, played by Nathan Lane. Armand has a 20 year-old son, whom he had with a one night stand and raised himself, who wants to get married. The only problem is his fiancée's father is a very conservative senator who couldn't possibly allow his daughter to marry the Jewish son of a gay couple. Barbara, Calista Flockhart, and Val, Dan Futterman, decide it would be easiest to lie to Barbara's family. With a subject as controversial as politics, The Birdcage, gives us an excitingly different take on modern families living in the 90's. With the crazy, yet relatable characters, you are made to feel like a part of the downward spiral of a family dinner of meeting the parents. Robin Williams' performance is comparable to his line from the movie, ""It's like riding a psychotic horse running toward a burning stable."" Amidst a chaotic situation, his character manages to rein in his psychotic horse, and lead the other horses in a way we don't normally get to see from him. He seems more in control in this film than we've seen him in various roles, for example, his role as the loving Mrs. Doubtfire. His performance is comparable to Jesse Tyler Ferguson's in ""Modern Family."" They are both more than capable of playing their parts, yet are more controlled than their counterparts: Nathan Lane and Eric Stonestreet, who steal the show with their flamboyance. With Robin Williams' comical, fun, yet controlled performance, he perfectly compliments his counterpart, Nathan Lane. Nathan Lane gives us a fresh and genuine performance that you wouldn't find from anyone else. The only performance comparable to Nathan Lane's is the incomparable Starina who he plays in the drag show. They steal the show and make viewers focus solely on them. His lovable character warms hearts while his actions leave you feeling a bit on edge. He manages to leave you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next thing to escape from his mouth. The much underrated actor, Hank Azaria, playing Agador/Spartacus, the Goldman's butler, captivates audiences with his comical one-liners. Nathan Lane may play a true showstopper and Robin Williams may deliver a hilarious, yet constructive performance. However, you can't help, but love Hank Azaria's sassy portrayal. From his short shorts, to his Guatemalan accent, to his invention of Pirin tablets, and his no-shoes policy, Agador/Spartacus is the real reason The Birdcage can be re-watched so many times and still remain so funny.With the use of brilliant filming angles, you're made to feel as though you a part of this crazy modern family. Which makes the theme song, ""We Are Family,"" quite appropriate. To an extent, the movie is quite relatable to family life, which appeals to many audiences. Every family has its peculiarities and eccentric extended family members, in other words, it's very rare to get out of a family celebration without something going awry. Not only does The Birdcage subtly poke fun at conservative politics, it also makes a mockery of awkward family celebrations.",The Birdcage
187,chas9g-1,Dinner dishes,10,15 September 2005,"I dearly love this movie. I am such a horn dog for anything Nathan Lane does. He is an amazing talent and I'm glad he is a proud gay man! Robin Williams is always a hoot, although I don't think of this as his best work! Dan Futterman is just plain cute! I wish he would have had a swimming scene in the movie. This is just a great entertaining movie. I have seen it several times. I own a VHS tape and the DVD. I also have a copy of the script! I go back now and watch the movie ""La Cage"" and laugh harder at the matching scenes.When I was about 7, my family had some pieces of the china that was used on the table for dinner. They talk about the ""naked Greek boys"" playing leapfrog. I would love to get hold of that china. I can't seem to locate the name or any information about it! Anyone have ideas?",The Birdcage
