0,Leofwine_draca,"In terms of plot, this is a complete mess",3,9 April 2017,"I didn't care much for NOW YOU SEE ME, a sub-OCEAN'S ELEVEN heist/caper movie with a few magical, sleight-of-hand touches, but it looks great compared to this lacklustre, rushed-out sequel which is set in Macau for some reason. Most of the team from the first film are back with the exception of Isla Fisher, who is replaced by CLOVERFIELD'S Lizzy Caplan, now a flavour of the month in Hollywood.Sadly, the first film's semi-realism is done away with entirely in favour of increasingly ridiculous set-ups and situations here. Woody Harrelson was grating in the first movie but now he's back and playing his own twin as well. He's really irritating and smug to boot. The most interesting casting choice is Michael Caine playing Harry Potter's dad; Daniel Radcliffe is the villain of the piece but completely wishy-washy and unimposing. Mark Ruffalo is the only one who come out of this with his head held high, but even he is ill served by the nonsense of the plotting.",Now You See Me 2
1,SnoopyStyle,Lizzy Caplan substitution great,6,17 July 2016,"Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) is in prison and vows to take his revenge on the Four Horsemen. J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) remain after the Eye releases member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) is eager to join the Horsemen. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) gives them the job of taking down tech businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb). The group gets exposed, and kidnapped by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merritt's twin Chase McKinney to Macau, China. Walter is Owen's former partner and has faked his death to go off grid. He blackmails the Horsemen to steal a chip that can decrypt anything from Owen. That's before the return of Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine).I like Isla Fisher but substituting for Lizzy Caplan is a great move. She is loads of fun and the main reason I like this more than the original. I like this movie up to Radcliffe's reveal of their kidnapping. I don't think the Harrelson twin adds anything great. It's a functional caper movie until the twists pile up. Like the original, the movie deteriorates in the second half and I stop caring. It's a mixed review but I love some great Lizzy.",Now You See Me 2
2,nogodnomasters,You are chosen as to what you will become.,9,25 November 2017,"The Four Housemen return, but are in hiding. Lula (Lizzy Caplan) is introduced as a replacement for Isla Fisher. They are attempting to keep spying software out of the hands of evil capitalists played by Michael Cain and his illegitimate son Daniel Radcliffe presumably dead. The first part of the film was low entertainment compared to the first feature. We knew how they got to China before it was explained and the pass the card scene, started out cute, got Lizzy out of her bra, put grew old fast and was beneath the writers to use magician slapstick.However, once the scene shifted to London, it was business as usual. A third sequel is in production. While I wanted to see more of Woody Harrelson, creating an idiotic evil twin didn't make it. We get to learn more about the past and ""The Eye."" If you loved the first one, you'll like this one. There is a quick refresher in the beginning, but it was not designed as a recap.Guide: No swearing sex or nudity",Now You See Me 2
3,kosmasp,See me or no see me?,9,23 February 2017,"This sets place after the events of the first movie, which a sleeper hit. A success no one expected, but the sequels I guess in such cases are to be expected (yes Part 3 is a go for 2019). So while I was more than cautious with my expectations considering this movie, I was more than entertained by the end result I had the pleasure to watch.Don't get me wrong, this is not perfect and does have a couple of hurdles. But as with most magicians they do a great trick in diverting your attention. And of course there is one set piece which seems completely redundant in light of a twist that reveals it needn't be that complicated. But if you start questioning the fun factor, then you won't be able to enjoy this anyway. Yes this is supposed to be fun and light and it is both of those things. Sit back, relax and take this in as it is meant to be ...",Now You See Me 2
4,classicsoncall,"""I wonder which one of us gets to play the bimbo"".",7,3 October 2018,"I probably need to see this more than once to get the full nuance of what's going on with the Four Horsemen, but I just don't have the patience. If anything, the picture is just as slick and entertaining as the original, but with boatloads of incredulous stuff that wouldn't be nearly possible in real life. Like that entire card sleight of hand sequence in Macau - not a single slip up, every throw perfectly synchronized, and clueless guards to make a getaway possible. The most thought that was put into this movie was someone's idea that the late Lionel Shrike owned a watch specifically made for him, with the name 'EPACSE' Chronograph printed inside the face. ""Escape' spelled backwards in case you missed it. And escape is pretty much what you're ready to do with all the dizzying special effects and CGI that makes real magic an impossibility. I'd rather watch Copperfield.",Now You See Me 2
5,jboothmillard,Now You See Me 2,4,23 July 2016,"The first film was lame and boring, I said I didn't understand why they would bother making a sequel, but they did, I wanted to see it because of the good cast, and see if it would be worse than the predecessor, directed by Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, G.I. Joe: Retaliation). Basically a year has passed since The Four Horsemen: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco, James's brother) outwitted the FBI and won the public's adulation with their magic spectacles, they are now in hiding. Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher, unavailable due to her pregnancy) has since left, she got tired waiting for her next orders from FBI agent and their leader and handler Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) or from secret society The Eye, and illusionist Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) has replaced her. Rhodes assigns them a new mission, they infiltrate the launch party for the new software of corrupt businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb), they plan to expose the software that secretly steals data on its users for Case's benefit, but Atlas, McKinney and May are interrupted by a mysterious individual who reveals that Wilder, thought to be dead, is alive, and that Rhodes is their mole. Attempting escape, the Horsemen are captured by mercenaries, led by Merritt's vain, greedy, self- centred twin brother Chase (Harrelson), who has the same training as him, and he takes them to his employer, technology prodigy Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe). Mabry wants the Horsemen to use their skills to steal the data-mining device developed by Case from a secret facility beneath a casino, the chip allows the user to decrypt any electronic device around the world, threatening to kill them they agree to carry out this seemingly impossible heist. The Four Horsemen want to clear their names and reveal the mastermind to the whole, Mabry is not the only one in the scheme, Rhodes' rival Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) is plotting his way out of his prison cell and getting involved, the team manage to carry out the robbery. After some more ducking and diving, and the reveal that Mabry is acting on behalf of his father Arthur Tressler (Sir Michael Caine), the Four Horsemen travel to London, England, where preparations are being made for the New Year celebrations, the team are there to cause diversions of street magic and ultimately plan to expose both Mabry and Tressler for their actions. It looks like their plan has failed when they are taken aboard a private jet, which one by one they are thrown out of, however, the Four Horsemen have tricked Mabry and Tressler with a trick, their plane did not take off, they are in the middle of the River Thames and everything is exposed to the public, just before the strike of midnight and the fireworks mark the New Year. In the end Mabry, Tressler and Case are arrested by the FBI, Rhodes gives the data-mining device to FBI Deputy Director and Agent Natalie Austin (AVP: Alien vs. Predator's Sanaa Lathan), who allows him to escape, Bradley compliments Rhodes and the Horsemen for what they have achieved, he reveals he is high- up in the Eye, the final scene sees them all going down a spiral staircase, this turns out to look like the eye. Also starring Jay Chou as Li, David Warshofsky as Agent Cowan, You Only Live Twice's Tsai Chin as Bu Bu, Game of Thrones' Richard Laing as Lionel Shrike and The Inbetweeners' Henry Lloyd-Hughes as Allen Scott-Frank. All the actors remain pretty well suited for their parts, new addition Radcliffe (suitable casting, considering his former magician character fame) gets some good moments as the villain, and there are still good special effects, camera tricks and editing, especially the Mission: Impossible style heist scene, the story this time is a bit more rounded and less boring, perhaps predictable in parts, however it is much more complicated with too much going on, hopefully the announced third film will be the last, this is a sort of alright crime thriller. Okay!",Now You See Me 2
6,Tweekums,Plenty of magic... just not magical,6,30 October 2019,"These comments assume you've seen the first film so don't need further details about returning characters.Eighteen months have passed since the group of magicians known as 'The Four Horseman' outwitted the FBI and robbed their previous sponsor, Arthur Tressler; now they are about to stage their return. Well three of them are, Henley Reeves has been replaced by new girl Lula May. They plan to use their skills to expose a plot to steal personal data from anybody buying a new piece of software... things don't go to plan and the four must flee. Things take a surprising turn as they slide down a chute from a New York rooftop and land in a restaurant in Macau! Here Merritt McKinney is bet by his brother, and enemy, Chase, who takes them to Walter Mabry, a former employee of Chase who wants them to steal a chip that will give him access to any computer. Meanwhile their associate, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes is on their tail along with Thaddeus Bradley, the man they left to rot in jail. What follows is a succession of magic tricks that culminate in a final reveal in London on New Year's Eve as they face an old adversary.If the plot sounds a bit convoluted that is because it is at times. In a way that doesn't matter as it is there to provide and excuse for magic tricks and misdirection. Unfortunately this is often a problem as many of the tricks require the viewer to accept that a person can unwittingly be hypnotised in an instant or believe in tricks that clearly rely on CGI or other special effects. Also some of the tricks go on too long; notably how they pass the stolen chip between each other as they are searched. On the plus side, if you can suspend your disbelief, there are plenty of fun moments... I particularly liked Lula's simple bit rather disturbing tricks. The cast is solid and clearly having fun; that fun is infectious at least while watching the film. Once it was over I felt it had passed the two hours well enough but imagine most of it will soon be forgotten. Overall hardly a must see but fun enough.",Now You See Me 2
7,blanche-2,didn't mind it,7,25 August 2017,"A couple of caveats here: I'm not an expert on this type of film, and I didn't pay to see it in a movie theater, both of which color my review.In ""Now You See Me 2"" the Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan) are back a year after their Vegas act, where they rob a bank in Paris and give the money to the members of the audience. This time Dylan Shrike, still posing as an FBI agent, asks them to expose a company who has a computer card that can get into any computer and manipulate the data.Again, they come up against their nemesis, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) whom they robbed a year ago, and his son (Daniel Radcliffe), who want not only the card but to bring down the Horsemen.The whole thing culminates in a huge New Year's Eve show in London.I thought this was fun and entertaining, not to mention outrageous, but that's part of the fun too. I don't take these things too seriously. I enjoyed seeing Michael Caine, Daniel Radcliffe, and Morgan Freeman in their roles as well as the Horsemen.Often in these franchises, the second film isn't as good as the first. This is no exception. Maybe the third will be better.",Now You See Me 2
8,studioAT,What a mess,2,17 January 2017,"First of all I'm surprised that there's a sequel to 'Now You See Me' in the first place. The first film was a classy new take on the heist movie, but I certainly didn't think it needed a sequel.But Hollywood obviously dictated that it did,so nearly all of the original cast reunite for this rather silly follow-up that isn't nearly as good.It all starts well, but soon we're on a pointless jaunt around the world, with some poor dialogue and ridiculous plot points along the way. The minute Woody Harrelson ends up playing his twin I knew the game was up and that this sequel would join a long line of 'weaker than original' cash ins. It's a shame really, because this has a talented cast, who seemed game to make this a hit.The absence of Isla Fisher divides fans, some missed her, some didn't. I thought that while Lizzy Caplan brought something different to the role of female horseman, it didn't really work.A real mess of a film.",Now You See Me 2
9,CinemaSerf,Poor quality follow-up.,6,7 November 2020,"Sadly, this has neither the charm nor the originality of the first film - even despite the efforts of veteran's Sir Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. Mark Ruffalo and the four horsemen are vying with each other and a really mis-cast Dan Radcliffe to try and procure a secret chip that could decrypt and control just about everything from government secrets to your steam iron. The action scenes are repetitive and go on too long, and the comic touches from the first film have been thrown under the bus somewhat. Woody Harrelson has become even more annoying and though Jesse Eisenberg tries hard, and for the most part still manages to keep it off the rocks, there is precious little for Dave Franco or Lizzy Caplan to get their teeth into. Does not bode well for the third instalment - the plot seam is already pretty much exhausted and what was an interesting concept in the first film has been subsumed into a visual effects-fest with very little substance.",Now You See Me 2
10,oscaralbert,This flick is bound to leave everyone wondering . . .,7,11 June 2016,". . . where in the world are Ron and Hermione?! As retired Boy Wizard Daniel Radcliffe roams the planet from Macau to London in search of a credible plot for NOW YOU SEE ME 2, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are nowhere in sight. Instead, Harry Potter faces off against such ""B-movie"" Gary Busey or Eric Roberts Wannabes as Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Mark Ruffalo. Jesse Eisenberg continues his slide down toward their level as he apparently lacks the SOCIAL NETWORKING skills necessary to latch onto projects that can at least keep movie audiences alert for two hours (even if the film lacks prestige--I had to nudge my seat mate awake a couple of times during SEE ME 2 when her snoring became a distraction from what little was happening on-screen). Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are as happy to provide window dressing for a BATMAN offering as a penguin march, but their presence alone in limited roles is not always worth the price of admission. Join me in pledging NOW WE WON'T SEE YOU AGAIN unless they at least toss Ron and Hermione into the mix for the trilogy's climax.",Now You See Me 2
11,neil-476,Entertaining but not magical,7,23 May 2018,"2013's Now You See Me was a glossy cross-genre movie in which a group of four stage magicians - the Horsemen - created assorted illusions the purpose of which, it transpired, was to remove money from corrupt big business and return it, Robin Hood-style - to those from whom it has been stolen.This sequel reunites the cast (with the exception of Isla Fisher, whose token female place is taken by Lizzie Caplan), with the addition of Daniel Radcliffe, and this time they are on the defensive as things go somewhat awry. They have to figure out how to steal a high-tech bit of kit from a computer company, and various magic techniques are brought to bear in a rather improbable but very enjoyable robbery caper.The whole thing is rather improbable, to be frank, but that didn't spoil it: it's quite clever, and it's great fun, and that was quite sufficient to enable me to suspend my disbelief, especially throughout the rather silly but hugely enjoyable finale (they explained how the three card monte worked, but they never explained how Jesse Eisenberg did his disappearance).The cast are all fine - even Radcliffe, who seldom impresses me as an actor, is OK. The Horsemen work well as an ensemble, and there are some revelations which refer back to the first film, although you don't have to have seen it in order to appreciate them.It's not quite as good as its predecessor, but it's still great fun.",Now You See Me 2
12,phd_travel,Too long and hard to follow but locations are fun,3,4 December 2016,The main problem with this movie is that the story is an overlong mess. It goes on and on with twists and whatever that it's just tough to follow the story. The magic seems a bit lame and repetitive. In the end I didn't care what was happening to whom.But there are some good points. The locations in Macau and London have a fun on location feel. They didn't choose the nicer parts of Macau to film in but it felt authentic. The Covent Garden and Tower Bridge scenes in London were quite magical.Liked the cast. The older cast is likable and it's nice to see the actress Tsai Chin on screen again. Daniel Radcliffe shows he can overcome his small stature to act in any mainstream non Harry Potter movie.Not quite worth a watch.,Now You See Me 2
13,gradyharp,'We are going out with a show people will never forget.',3,3 September 2016,"And the sequels rerun on and on. NOW YOU SEE ME was an entertaining movie, but sadly Ed Solomon and Peter Chiarelli (with characters by Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) let the original concept become simply tiresome, not only in story but in silly diversions that add little except excessive length to this remake/extension now called NOW YOU SEE ME 2. John M. Chu can't seem to keep it together enough to make it fascinating the way the original played.As the plot goes, 'one year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, The Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan) resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. The man behind their vanishing act is none other than Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe), a tech prodigy who threatens the Horsemen into pulling off their most impossible heist yet. Their only hope is to perform one last unprecedented stunt to clear their names and reveal the mastermind behind it all. Mark Ruffalo is the FBI/Four Horsemen accomplice, Morgan Freeman is now out of Prison and stirring up details, unfortunately Woody Harrelson is now morphed into a twin (silly repulsive makeup and wig and eccentric mannerisms as a bad guy), Michael Caine is still on board, and a host of Chinese and American actors who range from noticeable to invisible. Some of the visual effects are well done, some of the magic ticks are cute if overplayed, but in the long run this film has little comparison to the first version. Too long, too loosely assimilated. And sadly, there is another sequel on the way.........",Now You See Me 2
14,Mr-Fusion,"Seriously, how do you sap all the fun out of illusions?",5,9 November 2016,"""Now You See Me 2"" is somewhat of an improvement over the first movie, mostly because of the slightly more relaxed editing and the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan (really the movie's sole source of charisma). But really I just checked out of most of this. The reversals and switches just pile up and there's zero sense of reality here. You just go with it; and I respect that sense of pushing the boundaries, but it resulted in another forgettable movie. There's a scene showing the gang trying to get (essentially) a playing card through a security checkpoint. Most of it is quick camera pans and a ton of CGI. And you're not supposed to follow it so much as be dazzled.There's just no substance to any of this.5/10",Now You See Me 2
15,KineticSeoul,Very standard sequel,4,14 September 2016,"The first one was actually sort of refreshing with a team of vigilante magician. This sequel just didn't seem all that necessary and it just didn't have something all that new from the previous one. It's like they crammed a bunch of ideas into this sequel and decided that it just might work out. What it leaves behind is a cardboard borefest, with everything going in a very predictable direction. It's even more cheesier this time around as well. With the heist after heist with only one scene actually standing out. It's the scene where the team tries to retrieve the card from a super computer. While doing card stealth tricks to fool the guards. The twist is simply not far fetched but just plain dumb...And it's a tool to have a twist and lengthen the story. With some many action and tricks going on, it was just so darn boring to sit through. It might be because I have seen way too many films. But this is a forgettable sequel that doesn't really integrate anything all that clever when it comes to the plot. It's still somewhat of a watchable movie but it's also a very forgettable sequel.4.5/10",Now You See Me 2
16,Hellmant,"At over two hours, it impressively flies by!",8,29 June 2016,"'NOW YOU SEE ME 2': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2013 surprise 'caper flick' hit; about a group of four illusionists, that rob from the rich and give to the poor, during elaborately staged magic shows. This installment has the magic team being forced to pull off their most challenging heist yet, for a greedy tech genius. Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine all reprise their roles (from the original movie); while Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Radcliffe and Sanaa Lathan join the cast (Isla Fisher is noticeably absent, due to her recent pregnancy). Jon M. Chu directed the flick (he's previously helmed films like 'G.I. JOE: RETALIATION', two Justin Bieber documentaries, and two 'STEP UP' sequels), and it was written by Ed Solomon (who also co-wrote the original movie) and Peter Chiarelli. The film is definitely a lot of fun, and consistently entertaining throughout (just like the original).The remaining three members of the famous illusionist team, known as the Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Harrelson and Franco), have been hiding out for a year. The FBI is still on their trail, and FBI mole, Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), is still protecting them. Then Rhodes helps them setup another elaborate magic show heist, that goes horribly wrong. The team wakes up in China, and finds themselves being blackmailed into another caper; by a tech genius named Walter Mabry (Radcliffe). A witty magician named Lula May (Caplan) joins the crew, on this new mission. I'd say if you're a fan of the original flick, you'll probably like this sequel just as much (or close to it). It's filled with all the same cool magic tricks, detailed (and impressively involving) heists, and witty banter. The cast is all great again (I'm a huge fan of Eisenberg's) and Caplan is an awesome addition to the cast (she's definitely an improvement over Fisher). I can't really see any major faults in it; and at over two hours, it impressively flies by!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",Now You See Me 2
17,thesar-2,Ocean's Hungover Again,4,27 August 2016,"Seriously. Who's asking for these sequels or reboots. Only one in maybe 15-20 make money, so it can't be the studios or the audience. Egos, perhaps?It's been almost three years to the day since I saw the original and the only memory I took from it was that I really liked it. I hardly recall scenes, or what made me really like it, just that I did. I cannot say the same for the Ocean's Twelve/Hangover Part II crossover dud.But, to be fair, there were scenes I did like and the third act reminded me a little more of what I liked about the first one. Unfortunately, we still had the first two aimless acts to get through to arrive at our happy place. Not to mention, that first two-thirds or so felt like you MUST have JUST seen the original to follow all these events. More than half the time, they were doing the infamous ""Remember when we did this/you said that"" mentions that irritated my amnesia all the more.So, this doesn't stand alone sequel involves on-the-run magicians desperate to make a new splash, get used by a maze of villains and need to prove their worth to get out of it. Hardly an original idea for a sequel, let alone any film and at over two hours, it gets tedious.That all said, the gang does have charisma. I definitely like the cast and the ending *almost* makes this follow-up a recommendation. But, as mentioned, it's best to watch both together so not to get lost like I did for the most part.***Final thoughts: I guess part III's in development, already. Ah-hem, like the Ocean's and Hangover movies I compared this to. This is not due to the American box office, of course, since it made just about half of what the first one did here in the U.S. It was, however, a smash hit overseas. Same goes for the Ice Age movies. While that one is an obvious franchise (for kiddies,) this one never really felt like one.",Now You See Me 2
18,cherold,as entertaining and stupid as the first one,7,8 September 2016,"Everything that was an issue in the first movie returns in the second. Once again, Morgan Freeman is a magic debunker, hypnosis can make anyone do anything, and a mysterious organization has seemingly unlimited resources with no explanation.But everything that was fun about the first movie is back as well. There are a bunch of magic tricks, which might or might not be possible in real life, Woody Harrelson is quite entertaining in two different roles, and there are some beautiful set pieces, like a brilliant though overlong scene involving a computer chip attached to a playing card. Sadly, Isla Fischer is not in this one. The story is she was pregnant, although I'm always suspicious when the pretty girl is swapped out, since Hollywood tends to see pretty girls as replaceable. She is replaced by the always entertaining Lizzy Caplan. Harry Potter also shows up (well, Daniel Radcliffe, anyway). The movie feels slightly more unfocused than the first one, which itself was all over the map, and way to much of the end is given over to exposition, but as with the original, I had fun in spite of all its flaws.",Now You See Me 2
19,FeastMode,my notes,3,30 June 2019,"While the first movie had some questionable parts and things that are hard to believe, this movie just went completely over the top with things that don't make any sense. if you tried to pick apart this movie, it would just be full of flaws, plot holes, and things that just seem impossible. they just tried to make it bigger like with most sequels, and it didn't work. I absolutely HATED the addition of the character Chase, and i didn't really like the replacement for Isla Fisher. Although watching the first one again, Isla fisher is the worst part of the movie IMO. (1 viewing)",Now You See Me 2
20,Edvis-1997,6,6,3 December 2018,"Average movie, kind of liked it but it's really messy and when I'm saying messy it means that there are too many things happening at once so the film is getting bland and can't attract audience attention.",Now You See Me 2
21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Better than the first, this is an enjoyable film without much substance; it has a weak plot and even weaker villain, but there are some good scenes and better characters.",6,13 July 2016,"'Now You See Me 2 (2016)' is the sequel to a 2013 film about a group of magicians who rob banks during their live stage shows and it should definitely have been called 'Now You Don't'. I don't think the first film is all that good, but it isn't terrible either. This film is set two years after the events of the original, and this time involves the 'Horsemen' being brought out of hiding to pull off a new heist. I definitely enjoyed this movie more than its predecessor, but that by no means implies it's great. It still has its fair share of problems and is largely uninspired. However, it's still a pretty solid, if shallow, action-thriller.The plot of the film is one of its weakest aspects. It feels very long, even though each individual scene moves along at a brisk pace, and ultimately doesn't amount to much. This time, the story has been scaled down somewhat and streamlined to be more focused than its predecessor, spending a lot more time with the 'Horsemen'. An issue I have with the first is that the perspective shifts from the magicians to the FBI, making it hard to root for and fully understand the motivations of the 'Horsemen.' Thankfully, this is fixed this time by sidelining the FBI and paying more attention to the main characters; they don't spend as much time on stage and we follow them all the way through the picture. It makes their motivations and character arcs noticeable, allowing us to relate to them and their situation much easier. The flick also doesn't feel like it's trying to be too clever for its own good, like the first does. There are a few twists and turns but they are all predictable and don't feel like the crux of the narrative. They are largely uninspired, don't amount to much and probably could have been omitted, but at least the filmmakers seem to know this. It doesn't feel like they think that they've pulled one over on us, which is a vibe I get from the first film. The final reveal is also superfluous, and doesn't really make sense as it ripples across both movies and tries to retcon some motivations. It is unneeded, a twist for a twist's sake, and has no impact. The faux-intelligence isn't as apparent as in the first one though, and thus doesn't feel as pretentious.The other problem with the plot is that there really isn't all that much magic. The movie doesn't feel like one about magicians, instead making them appear like pseudo-spies, and the whole film feels more similar to a traditional heist picture. One of the best scenes is an extended sequence in which the 'Horsemen' must hide an important playing card on themselves whilst being searched; they employ all sorts of distraction, misdirection and sleight of hand. This sequence is enjoyable and well put together, with the individual character personalities feeding into the action. There is some suspense here, and the scene mixes both action and slapstick together quite well. Most of the magic in the film feels a lot more tangible than in the first, even though there are some impossible vanishes and a sequence involving Jessie Eisenberg manipulating the rain that's ludicrous. There are some sleight of hand sequences which are mostly possible, using several recognisable techniques and real misdirection tactics, but the reliance on CGI is a little much at times (including some digital card doubles). While I found the magic to be more realistic this time around, the tricks performed aren't all that spectacular and the final 'trick' is very weak, with almost no actual 'magic' on display. I found the direction to be better this time, as there isn't any nauseating camera motion and there a few longer takes. It doesn't cut nearly as much, and the edits aren't jarring. There were a few continuity errors, though, and places where characters snap to different positions between shots. There is also a fight scene that is very hard to read visually, due to the heavy amounts of shaky-cam and quick cutting. The action is confusing at times, and the fight as a whole is pretty underwhelming.The characters this time around are given more to do, and more motivation to do it. The only real arc belongs to Mark Ruffalo's character though, as he changes throughout the course of the film. He also gives the best performance and is the most interesting screen presence. Jessie Eisenberg has the beginnings of an arc, though it's all but forgotten at the mid-point, and a couple of reveals serve to give new light to some character motivations. There are two major new additions to the cast, that of Lizzy Caplan's fourth 'horseman' (as Isla Fisher was pregnant at the time of filming) and Daniel Radcliffe's villain. Caplan is given more screen-time than Fisher has in the original, and her character actually has some impact on the plot. She also has a more rounded and unique personality, though she is mainly relegated to being the comic relief, and does a good job making her character believable. I didn't find her funny, though. Instead, she comes off as awkward in a talking-too-much kind of way. Still, the character isn't necessarily annoying, despite arguably having too much dialogue at times. Radcliffe provides a very weak villain, coming across as neither threatening nor powerful. His performance is good enough, but it's the material he's given that's lacking. His character is very one dimensional, isn't given all that much screen-time and doesn't have all that much impact on the plot.Overall, this film to be more enjoyable than its predecessor. It has a weak villain, bland plot and poor magic, but is ultimately entertaining and has a couple of stand-out scenes: 6/10.",Now You See Me 2
22,bowmanblue,A trick too far,6,12 February 2018,"The original 'Now You See Me' film was an incredibly enjoyable affair. It was possibly one of the finest examples of how, if you were willing to suspend your disbelief to epic levels, you really could have a great time watching it. It was Hollywood glitz and popcorn-munching fun all the way through. The - A-list - cast was perfect and played off each other brilliantly, depicting a quartet of modern day Robin Hood-style magicians who stole from the rich and corrupted through the use of their dazzling illusions and, in turn, gave back to the poor. I suppose its success basically guaranteed a sequel would be greenlit. And, where I do give the film credit for doing its best to follow-on closely from the events in the first outing, this time round it's just too unbelievable to be convincing - no matter how hard you try to suspend your disbelief.I really wanted to like this film - and I guess I did. There were plenty of neat moments here and there, it's just I wanted to like it a LOT. And I didn't. The story picks up a little while after the events of the first one and the most noticeable difference for me was the fact that Isla Fisher hasn't returned this time round. She's therefore instantly replaced by another female magician who slots into the team a little too well. Then we get to the meat of the story where the twists and turns start to overtake general common sense and credibility.The rest of the cast return, but the main newcomer is Daniel Radcliffe who entraps the magicians in an attempt to use their collective skills to steal something for him. And, as I mentioned, the 'magic' set-pieces are indeed well-filmed and cool to watch. However, the story just doesn't add up. One of the main complaints from the first one was the 'twist' which left some viewers feeling a little short-changed. Here, the film tries to 'out-twist' the original by taking the story in all sorts of directions which leave you truly confused as to who is on who's side and who is trying to double-cross who.I know that part of the fun with watching magicians perform is trying to guess how the trick is done. With the first film you could just about believe that the feats they carry out could just about be actually real if all the circumstances were just right. In the sequel, everything feels a little cheap as you naturally try to predict how they accomplish these feats, only to find out that the ways they do them are tantamount impossible.Overall, it's an enjoyable enough film, but it does try to be a little too clever for its own good and therefore ends up being too unbelievable to be credible.",Now You See Me 2
23,ThomasDrufke,Throws Out All Logic and Realism,5,11 June 2016,"With the pull of academy award winning actors and a promise of 'wow' factor, the first Now You See Me film managed to be the definition of a great cable watch. But with the silliness in tone and in the added suspension of disbelief, the sequel is about as frustratingly stupid as it is visually impressive.It's hard to deny the acting talent that is aboard this franchise. There are 17 Academy Award nominations between this cast, but for the most part, the Now You See Me films seem to be paycheck films for those respected actors. That's not to say they don't have tons of fun, Woody Harrelson is easily the best thing in the film (although they try to do way too much with his 'twin'). But even if I'm being honest, I don't go see these movies for the incredible acting, I go to see some awesome magic.Unsurprisingly, the film decides to jump ship on any logic at all when it comes to the magic from The Four Horseman. Along with Harrelson is returning cast members Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, and Dave Franco; with newest horseman being Lizzy Caplan. Remember in the first film when all of these guys did magic tricks that you somewhat believed could be true if you really tried? Yeah, that's all thrown out the window. Granted there are attempts to explain the outrageous supernatural-level acts, but even the explanations don't add up.Sure, this film does have its impressive moments, however. Any easily pleased action fan will have a good time watching the various ridiculous acts of the horseman. Even I really enjoyed one particular card-trick scene between the 4 main horseman. But I think I would have liked a bigger effort being put to a Prestige type story and not a mindless action film with more twists than it can handle. Or perhaps the series should just take the Fast & Furious route and stay ridiculous. If the third one does go the route of the ladder, I would hope it doesn't try to outsmart itself, because this film sure does.+Card trick scene+Visuals and Horseman acts can be fun-Throws out all logic-More twists and turns than it can handle5.2/10",Now You See Me 2
24,lesleyharris30,"A Sequel that Never Gives itself a Reason to Exist,",5,20 August 2018,"Now You See Me 2 is a very mediocre film with a thin plot and a talented cast that are never given a chance to shine here. What the film does still offer is some visually terrific sequences, even when it can get convuluted, it is always fuj to see these magicians use their skills and it's a soecial thing this series has to offer that no other film series has. The plot is very flat, I really enjoyed the first Now You See Me and was looking forward to seeing how they continued this story, but they really did not try to break any boundaries or try to excel beyond any success they had with their predecessor, it was simoly by the numbers. The cast look like they are having fun, and that certainly makes it more watchable, but their is little to no scope added to their characters, we do not learn anything new or benefit in seeing them grow by watching this film, it offers little pay off. An uninteresting sequel. Lightly plotted and thinly developed, I would advise giving Now You See Me 2 a miss.

28,Bored_Dragon,Underrated,7,4 November 2016,"Everywhere on the web, you can see the bashing of this movie. I don't get it. The first one was madness. This one is a bit weaker, but it is still very entertaining two hours. Furthermore, I'm not even sure if it really is inferior or it is simply because it's a sequel. The first one was something new, original and unexpected, while sequels provide extensions of the familiar stories and therefore lack the element of surprise. There are some new tricks, but it is still just a sequel and it cannot surprise and amaze you as something completely new. I was thinking, if we switch places of these two movies I would not be surprised if NYSM 2 gets better or at least the same rating than NYSM 1. Anyway, I am not disappointed at all.7,5/10",Now You See Me 2
29,The-Sarkologist,There Are Cheaper Ways to get some sleep,2,11 June 2016,"All I can say was that this film was really boring. I guess the main reason that I saw it was because I ended being caught up with all of the advertising, and also I was wanting to kill a bit of time on a Friday night (and my local cinema has a permanent half-price on all tickets). I had seen the first film in the series and it was okay, but nothing all that spectacular, however, not surprisingly, the sequel ended up being a lot worse.Like most sequels, this film begins about a year after the first film ended, where the Four Horsemen became members of a secret society of illusionists (the film is not so much about magic, but rather about illusions), however they are also on the most wanted list. The thing is that they are really bored and want to get in on a bit more action, and then an opportunity arises – a telecommunications firm is releasing a new smart-phone, however what this smart phone does is that it takes all of your information and sells it to the highest bidder. So they crash the party and attempt to expose the fraud for what it is.The problem is that somebody is way ahead of them and end up exposing not only them, but the ring leader (who is still masquerading as an FBI agent). They flee, jump into a chute, and suddenly discover that they have been magically transported to Macau. Remember, the film is about illusion, not magic – all of the magic tricks in the film actually have a rational explanation behind them, including how they managed to magically travel from New York to Macau in what seemed like a matter of seconds.This was probably the most interesting aspect of the film – how they actually performed the illusions, but that didn't actually do all that much to save what is in effect a really boring movie. Like most sequels, the main characters, including the bad guys, come across from the previous film, though there are a few new faces, including Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame. The problem was that Radcliffe's character was actually really pathetic. I won't so much as say that it was his acting ability (though it could well have been), it is just that he simply did not seem to be able to play the part.In the end there is nothing really all that great about this film, and as far as I'm concerned, there are much better films out there that will simply leave this one for dead (which isn't all that hard).",Now You See Me 2
30,Reno-Rangan,"Not seeing what's coming to them, but overcoming is their task to complete.",6,24 September 2016,"I never thought a sequel would be made. Now it seems this will going to be an unstoppable franchise, we could expect more, the next one was official, especially after considering how this film fared at the box office. All the main cast returned with the new ones. I think Daniel Radcliffe was good, first time I had impression like that on him after Harry Potter series. So good to see the two legends, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The rest of the cast was good, but nothing to praise like they have pulled off the impossible. Overall, this is a good follow-up, but not best I was looking for. Though, the writing and direction were decent with some nice Chinese locations.The story follows after some time where the first one ended. After the biggest heist, now they are back with the new public shows. A new member was included, a female to balance with the existing ones. While performing a show, they had to abort it in the middle when the cops raid them. This time they are tricked by some unknown people and land in a foreign territory. In order to escape from there, they had to play what was instructed to them and so they comply with it. When their boss comes to their rescue, the things around them begin to change. So how it all ends was another twist.The film was two hours long, but not bad to hook for that long when pace and the story looked better. I'm not fully satisfied, particularly about the China. I know Hollywood found its second home, but that does not mean they have to add China flavour all the time to just make money in China. They might succeed from it, particularly from earning Yuan, but I'm the not happy, the world is not happy about that. You can make full length China subject film, but this kind of altering script is becoming sick. Because all the major films trying to do the same thing. I disliked this from that perspective. So sorry Hollywood, better luck next time.5.5/10",Now You See Me 2
31,paulclaassen,The magic is gone.,4,1 March 2021,"It usually is difficult for a sequel to live up to its predecessor. With 'Now you see me 2' I think they just tried too hard.The film picks up where the original left off - although now a year later. All the same characters are back, except Henley (Isla Fisher). I think this was their first mistake. They should have created an entirely new story around the Four Horseman, instead of treading on the past. The first film was mysterious and exciting. Now, they attempt to make it more complicated, and concentrate more on The Eye - quite frankly which added more confusion than answers.There's also far too many comedy elements, hence I didn't take it very seriously. The film is also laden with 'magic tricks' that's simply too unbelievable. The more they tried to explain them, the more ridiculous they were. (Especially the card trick scene when they stole the chip, and the plane scene...!!!). The plot also doesn't really offer anything new. It's pretty much a same old, same old premise - only with magic tricks here and there.The finale wasn't all that bad, although the reveal is not believable at all. I generally enjoy Daniel Radcliffe's post Harry Potter work, but he wasn't convincing in the role of one of the film's antagonists, Walter. With Michael Caine back as Tressler, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the film gave me a sense of deja vu. There was little excitement and the film wasn't as fast-paced.

32,Floated2,Not as bad as reviews claim,7,3 August 2018,"Now You See Me 2 is the sequel to hit original Now You See Me released in 2013. The film picks up a year later, with the Four Horsemen lying low, having formally joined secret magician society The Eye under Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), an FBI mole and man behind the curtain to the events of the first movie. They're growing restless waiting for their next big assignment, while Rhodes plays dummy to distract the FBI. However, after they're joined by new horsewoman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and given a mission to expose a tech magnate whose cell phones will phish private user info to buyers, things go awry. Soon, the Horsemen are separated from their mentor, plagued by enemies old and new around the world, and Rhodes has to team up with an old foe to sort out the mess.Although can be seen as both, though one of the biggest thing the sequel has over the first film is it tells an actual story instead of an incoherent setup to one. There's a big difference between mystery and confusion, and the first movie fell way on the confusion side, using twists to hide a muddled narrative. Here, we get to the actual concept: stage magicians using their talents to expose powerful crooks, liars, and thieves like a Vegas-bound Impossible Missions Force. Although this film may not be as suspenseful and mysterious as the original, where the final twist felt for organic and surprising, Now You See Me 2 isn't nearly as bad as some critics and reviews are claiming.

33,eddie_baggins,No magic to be found here,3,7 February 2017,"I really wanted to like 2013's Now You See Me. I love a good fun movie and I love being bluffed by clever magic, hence why I enjoy The Prestige to this day, but Louis Leterrier's financially successful and well-liked film was a dumb, daft and overblown experience that was neither as smart, sassy or suave as it thought it was, and I found myself thoroughly disappointed with the box office hit.Fast forward to 2016 and Australia's Isla Fisher has jumped the magic ship along with Leterrier, who has passed the directional baton to Jem and the Holograms and Step Up 3D mastermind Jon M. Chu, who has enlisted the comedic workings of Lizzy Caplin to fill in for Fisher and added a double dosing of Woody Harrelson and the world's most famous wizard Daniel Radcliffe to help enliven proceedings with this unwanted sequel, but while there's just as many flashing lights, colourful characters and ADHD storytelling as the first film, Now You See Me 2 is not surprisingly an even poorer attempt at movie magic than its throwaway forefather.To talk much about Now You See Me 2's plot would be giving too much credit to an event that pays near on zero attention to detail in trying to even make a miniscule attempt at making logical sense, and while it's fine for a film to look to entertain rather than adhere to logical rules of our existence in this universe, Chu's film doesn't even entertain throughout its overdrawn runtime.From incredible feats of card manoeuvring, manipulation of the weather or conference interrupting shenanigans, Now You See Me 2 certainly tries to be cool and its able cast that all look incredibly bored with their lot in sequellife (#showmethemoney) are pretty ""hip"", this experience feels tired and devoid of life, not something you want when what you've signed up for is supposedly a magical joy ride that will shock us with its reveals and make us gasp at its twists.The addition of Radcliffe adds a sprinkling of life to this rather dead-on-arrival and much too self-confident follow up, but this series that started out sounding promising, only to deliver a forgettable first entry and now this even more lacklustre sequel, is a one that needs to be laid to rest in the magicians coffin quickly, which sadly will be put on hold as the unappealing third entry to the franchise is brought to life over the coming years.1 ½ bouncing playing cards out of 5",Now You See Me 2
34,filipemanuelneto,"Uninteresting, hurried and loaded with clichés.",3,16 October 2020,"There are several films about the world of magic and illusionism available, and many are great. This film is just one more, and it followed one of the best, to reveal itself as one of the worst.The story is simple: after the events of the first film, the Horsemen separate and wait for instructions from the Eye. However, if some get tired and give up, others insist. Finally, they are summoned to expose the secrets of a new technological application but everything goes wrong: exposed to the world, they flee and end up in Macau, where they will have to find out who is the person who betrayed them.What can I say about this film? That many of the most interesting and entertaining features of the first film have simply disappeared. Director Jon M. Chu was able to reveal himself to be a nullity by making a hasty film, full of unrealistic and imaginative situations, as well as clichés like the evil twin or the illegitimate son who wants to please his father. Even as a piece of entertainment, this film is quite weak and unable to honor its predecessor.The cast is inherited from the previous film, with few modifications, but they are at a distance from giving us a good job because they weren't entitled to some decent material. So, we have again Jesse Eisenberg, more arrogant than in the first film, James Franco and Woody Harrelson, who will also give life to his character's presumptuous twin brother (a stupid script option, at the very least). Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also returned to their characters, and I would say that they are the best actors here. The problem is that they could not do anything to improve the film given that they did not have much visibility (Freeman and Ruffalo, who appear only when necessary, are really underused sometimes). The exit of Isla Fisher (quite intelligent given that she saved herself from a film that would not add anything good to her career) was filled by the entrance of Lizzy Caplan, as a fun character that makes you smile, adding moments of spontaneity and irreverence to a film that, without it, would be more boring. The villain was incarnated by Daniel Radcliffe, but he looks like a cynical caricature, and I was never able to take him seriously.Technically, it's a fairly regular film: on the positive side, I would highlight cinematography, with a good work of light and color, enhanced by the authentic color of the streets of Macau, a former Portuguese colony in China where much of the film takes place. The sets and costumes are good enough and there is some realism and verisimilitude in CGI and in visual and sound effects. The soundtrack, it seemed to me, is inherited from the previous film with few modifications.",Now You See Me 2
35,leonblackwood,Great characters but it needed some more magic! 5/10,5,1 December 2016,"Review: Although this movie is supposed to be about magicians, there actually isn't that much magic in it. After enjoying the first movie, it was good to see the Four Horsemen back in action, with there new recruit, Lula (Lizzy Caplan) but there was a lot of random scenes which spoilt the flow of the film. After stealing money from some important people in the first movie, J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) are forced into hiding, with the help of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) but there past soon catches up with them, and they are forced to steal a priceless chip, which can hack into every computer, and uncover important information. Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) is also in hiding, and he lost money when the Four Horsemen performed the heist in the first movie, so he knows that they are the best candidates to retrieve the chip, even though he is still upset with them about the money he lost. Whilst retrieving the chip, Dylan asks for help from another person who lost money from the original heist, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who points him in the right direction to find his friends, who have gone underground to plan the heist. Walter also recruits Merritt's brother, to make sure that the Four Horsemen do everything above board but once Walter's true plan comes to light, the whole plan turns pretty dark. Right from the beginning of the film, it's quite fast paced and there is something new happening in every scene but the director chose to show how they done a lot of there tricks, so it lacked the WOW! factor, which was what made the first movie so unique. There is loads of fast hand action which was quite impressive but apart from that, it's more of an Mission Impossible, type of movie, without the action. The cast was great and each character brought something different to the project but the plot was a bit weak and unbelievable. The main problem was that everyone was supposed to be in hiding but they seemed to be walking around without a care about getting caught. Also, some of them was supposed to be dead so that element didn't really make sense. Anyway, it's worth a watch but the original was better. Watchable!Round-Up: With both Now You See Me movies making around the same amount of money at the box office, audiences around the world obviously enjoy watching movies about magic, which is why I was surprised that there wasn't that much magic in this movie. The director Jon M. Church, 37, chose to stick with the heist element, and with the many different characters involved in the film, it seemed a bit of a mess in parts. His previous projects include Step Up 2: The Streets, Step Up 3D, Justin Bieber: Never Say Never & Believe, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Jem and the Holograms, so he has covered different genres in his career. There is a third movie in the pipeline, which isn't surprising because the cast seemed to have fun whilst making the movie but the director needs to add some more magical moments. Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $335millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/comedies, starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan, Daniel Radcliffe, Jay Chou, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, David Warshofsky and Sanaa Lathan. 5/10",Now You See Me 2

The plot is very similar to its predecessor but in my opinion there is no need to change something for the sake of change, it works and it works well. The majority of the cast return (minus Isla Fisher but is replaced by Lizzy Caplan who was a great addition) and whilst most of them are doing their job fine, some are more captivating (I'm looking at you Ruffalo and Radcliffe). The majority of twists and turns are predictable but that does not deter from what is an enjoyable flick. The magic is great and some of the scenes are so outlandishly ridiculous that you just go along with it (especially one scene involving a card and a search team...seriously genius). It does take a while for the film to get going but once in full motion, this 129 minute ride will fly by.

38,Vartiainen,Seems to have very little purpose or direction,3,4 April 2020,"The original Now You See Me was not a masterpiece. It had a fun idea and fun characters to go along with it, but it also felt muddled. For example, the whole shadowy organization, The Eye, behind it all felt completely unnecessary. The movie could just have been a fun little heist movie with four magicians deciding to get rich by using their talents. There was absolutely no need to throw in bargain bin Illuminati with rumours of real magic.And of course that bargain bin Illuminati is exactly what they chose to focus on in the sequel. Because of course it was. Gone are the quippy one-liners, gone is the flash and razzle dazzle, gone is the magic. Instead our main characters are on the run. It's all very dark and grim. You can trust no one and the police is right on their tails. Instead of them being two steps ahead of everyone else - you know, the fact that made the previous film so fun to watch - now they're constantly two steps behind. Of course they'll prevail by the end - it's still a movie - but it doesn't feel earned.And let me raise one gripe above others. There's very little magic in this film. Towards the end we start seeing them pull shows once more, and at point it becomes interesting, but before that, almost nothing.Okay, there's one very long scene with card tricks and more specifically card throwing, but that felt so pointlessly unneeded and complicated that it become unintentionally hilarious. If you don't want other people finding the card you're holding, perhaps don't throw it across the room a million times.That being said, the actors were still very enjoyable. Mark Ruffalo gets a lot more screen time this time around and his subplot was the most enjoyable by a wide margin. Perhaps more of that would have fixed the film. Then again, I came to this film to see the Horsemen, so having even less of them could also be very bad.Not a good sequel. Usually these things try to cram too much of what made the previous film work down our throats, but this falls into that other dangerous category: not knowing what made the previous film so good.",Now You See Me 2

How many movies actual are?Now You See Me 2 takes the magic from the original and milks it for all it's got. The biggest draw to this film is still the amazing cast. I think what made the first film work so well is that they got a group of people who seem to be having fun with one another and had some really good chemistry, so the chemistry returns as it's basically the exact same chemistry with a few new addictions.One of the biggest new attractions was Daniel Radcliffe, but to be honest I did not think he was all that worth spending your money on. He really did not bring anything cool to the mix, unlike Lizzy Caplin who replaced Isla Fisher and was able to fit right into the cast while equally being it's break out star. If you like the first movie because it was about magic, Now You See Me 2 was more about magicians trying to be like superheroes, but considering much of the cast appeared in some pretty big superhero movies, it's not surprising.

41,jtindahouse,A very good sequel full of twists and fun,9,8 June 2016,"Magic movies are fun. They are responsible for some of my favourite movies of all time. 'The Prestige', 'The Illusionist' and the original 'Now You See Me' all come instantly to mind, and now I can add 'Now You See Me 2' to that list, because it is a very impressive sequel. The series has a very similar feel to the 'Ocean's Eleven' trilogy, and we all know how the second installment of that series turned - not well. They made the mistake of making things too complicated for the average movie-goer to understand and just sit back and enjoy. 'Now You See Me 2' does a great job of keeping things intricate and twisted, while always keeping the audience in on the joke (and trick). There's the return of all the main stars (minus Isla Fisher who couldn't return due to her pregnancy) and the inclusion of some new ones who fit in seamlessly. In fact, I thought Lizzy Caplan was even more suited to the role of a magician than Fisher was, she did an excellent job as the newest Horseman. Daniel Radcliffe (yes the same one who found fame in another certain magic themed series) also joins the cast. His acting always comes across quite clunky to me, and I felt his performance worked more due to his star-power than actual acting chops.All the fun from the original is there. Everything you think you know, you should reconsider. There are twists and turns around every corner and the 129 minute run time flies by. Is there enough here for a third installment? I see no reason why not. The world of magic leads to infinite possibilities, and this cast is strong enough to carry a story and keep things fresh and fun. Personally I hope they do return again based on this fine effort.",Now You See Me 2

I really liked the first one, this was alright, I don't think it deserves the bashing it's getting from critics.The rest of the cast do return, except for Isla Fisher, who was replaced by Lizzy Caplan but a different character. Our favorite modern day Robin Hoods known has The Four Horseman find themselves exposed and on the run, and at the mercy of a billionaire(Daniel Radcliffe) Who wants them to a job or it's over. Will they find clever way to get out of it.It's does have some clever moments, you just don't see it coming. Although a little bit of the fun parts where just not here, only in some of it. Lizzy Caplan I did like, was not sure I would at first, but she really grew on me. Woody Harrelson seems to be having the most fun here, playing his characters twin brother. Jesse Eisenberg filmed this after Batman V Superman, I can tell looking at his short hair. Don't expect nothing more or less going into this, if so you'll be entertained by it.",Now You See Me 2
43,stevendbeard,Smoke & Mirrors,7,11 June 2016,"I saw ""Now You See Me 2"", starring Jesse Eisenberg-Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice, Zombieland; Mark Ruffalo-The Hulk in the Avengers movies, Windtalkers; Woody Harrelson-The Hunger Games movies, Zombieland; Dave Franco-The Neighbors movies, Warm Bodies; Lizzy Caplin- Masters of Sex_tv, 127 Hours and Daniel Radcliffe-Trainwreck, The Woman in Black.This is a sequel to the 2013 surprise hit. Seems like whenever a movie makes money nowadays, they will make a sequel-it's easier than coming up with original ideas, plus people like the familiar. Anyway, the Four Horsemen return with one substitution, Lizzy for Isla Fisher-I think I heard that Isla was pregnant and could not make it. Plot wise; Jesse, Mark, Woody and Dave have been in hiding, since the last movie, and are drawn out by a wealthy, want-a-be magician, Daniel. Daniel wants them to pull off a heist and threatens them if they refuse. There are the elaborate tricks, misdirection and smoke & mirrors magical spectacles that made the first movie popular and there is even an evil twin of one of the characters thrown in the mix-he plays both parts. FYI: I also heard that they are already talking about a third sequel. If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one, too. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes. I liked the first one and I would probably buy this one on DVD.",Now You See Me 2

45,alindsay-al,An average sequel,5,8 July 2016,"After recently watching the first now you see me I was pretty excited about this film but unfortunately like many sequels this film suffers and is not as good as the original. The premise of the film sees the four horsemen return, when they are forced to steal a piece of tech for an eccentric megalomaniac. Jesse eisenberg, woody harrelson and Dave Franco are the returning horsemen and they all do a good job in this film they have great chemistry together and there characters blend well together. Mark ruffalo like the first film is the best part of this film because he is easily the most interesting character in this film and has the most depth to him. Daniel Radcliffe is a good addition to the film as the villain with a fun performance he just isn't in the film that much. Michael caine and Morgan freeman are back in this film and they give decent performances for there screen time. Aisla fisher couldn't return for this film so she is replaced by Lizzy Caplan and unfortunately I just found her character really annoying and I just feel she didn't offer enough to the group. Also woody harrelson plays his twin brother in this film and my goodness this character was insanely over the top and really cringeworthy to watch. The story has very little depth to it and it feels like the basic plot is just used to show magic tricks and very little depth to it. Mark ruffalo has a bit of an interesting story but it feels very disconnected from the horsemen and it feels like a bit of a repeat from the first film. The first film has some decent humour and drama but like the first film it lacks anything that memorable which hurts the characters. The style has a bigger scale then the first film which means the magic is more over the top cgi events which do look pretty cool. But even more then the first film you have to disband your disbelief because most of the tricks seem impossible even with the explanations. Overall this is a poor sequel that isn't really worth a watch even if you liked the first film.",Now You See Me 2
46,iquine,Better Than the First One,7,30 August 2017,"(Flash Review)Now You See Me 1 tried to be overly cool, amazing and serious but failed to obtain those goals for me. This new one added a solid comedic angle which helped and was pretty funny at times. That helped it feel fun and allowed me to suspend my disbelief and not to pick apart plot holes too much. The high-level plot is a group a magicians try to reveal the unethical practices of a tech magnate to clear their names from the first movie. Some neat scenes and plenty of CGI magic. Speaking of magic, there aren't many neat illusions and any big magic/illusion is later spoiled during the plot. Woody Harrelson was really good. He had a twin brother (played by himself) that was really cartoony in a good way. Radcliffe played his bad guy role very well I felt; good acting. Anyway, it was moderately entertaining and lightly amusing with some fun visuals.",Now You See Me 2
47,sauravjoshi85,Fast paced screenplay makes the movie watchable,6,18 May 2021,"Now you see me 2 is a heist thriller movie directed by Jon M. Chu and stars an ensemble cast of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Daniel Radcliffe, Lizzy Caplan, Sanna Lathan, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.Four Horsemen is being recruited by a tech genius to pull off an impossible heist in the sequel of Now you see meIf you are a fan of no brainer fast paced heist thriller then this is the movie for you because the plot is missing and logic is been died it's own natural death. The movie has some good action scenes to keep your interest alive, some puzzling and unconvincing magic tricks, some car chases and chatterbox characters with some seasoning of emotions.Acting is good to average and it seems that Jesse Eisenberg is on auto-mode of talkative canny and still in the hangover of Mark Zukerberg the character he played in 'The Social Network', Mark Ruffalo was the most impressive and effective of them all, Woody Harrelson is great in his twin character, Dave Franco looks good, Daniel Radcliffe was decent and Lizzy Caplan irritates in few of the scenes and seriously I missed Isla Fisher. Morgan Freeman never disappoints and same is in this movie. Michael Caine is again not been utilized up to his potential just like the previous movie.Screenplay of the movie is not tightly grated but is very fast paced and probably this saves the movie from sinking, the screenplay is so fast as it feels that you are doing rafting, you doesn't know in which direction the boat is going but you are visually happy. There are some unconvincing plot twists but as you are going with a flow it will hardly matters. The movie had used excessive use of CGI, there are few good in fact smart action scenes which should be appreciated. Climax of the movie is again unconvincing but might entertain few as the movie gives an happy ending.Overall this movie might not be as great as it's previous part but the fast paced and some decent action scenes will make the movie watchable.",Now You See Me 2

49,davispittman,Pretty good.. Not as good as the first though,7,24 June 2016,"Now you see me 2 is not as good as the first one, which is typical for a sequel. But now you see me 2 is not one of those terrible sequels. For one thing I really enjoyed the acting, I thought that the acting was very well done by every cast member, and Lizzy Caplan is a good addition to the horsemen, her positive energy and witty humor works well with the film. Mark Ruffalo was alright in this one, and in my opinion he wasn't as good here as in the first one. OK, I enjoyed Woody Harrelson and his character, but his evil twin brother was just a big mistake and I really think the character would've been better off by being played by a different actor, I also thought the twin brother was just really annoying and purposefully weird and I thought his character was just crap. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine have really strong presences in this movie and they really give great performances. Daniel Radcliffe is alright, not quite as good as I thought he would be, but still not terrible or bad. And last but not least, there is Dave Franco, the sexy smoldering Dave Franco...... He is great here, he is one of my favorite things about this film. The action is good, not as great or often as in the original movie, but what's here is still sufficient. I think now you see me 2 wraps up nicely too, Morgan freeman ends it in one of his great famous monologues, and I thought the ending was good. 7/10 for Now you see me 2.",Now You See Me 2
50,TheOneThatYouWanted,You had me stop watching at Eisenberg,3,25 February 2017,"So yeah, I saw the first film and meh. I was looking at Daniel Radcliffe's IMDb page for another review and I saw he was in this so I put it on my watch-list. But funny story, about ten or twelve minutes into the film Jesse Eisenberg appears on screen and I literally stopped watching the film and deleted it from my DVR. The strange thing is that it was more of a reflex than a decision. I can not watch another second of Eisenberg in anything. If Chris Nolan was to make a movie starring Jesse Eisenberg I wouldn't watch it.. and I watch EVERY Nolan film.. in theaters.. sometimes multiple times. But from what I did watch of this film and the fact that the first film is completely overrated, I'm not missing out on anything.",Now You See Me 2

And then, another ship was created and wow. I feel like there's NOTHING negative anyone can say about this movie. I adore it!",Now You See Me 2
52,rgkarim,"Flash, Bang Boom: This Movie is Stunts, Comedy, and Tricks. Not so Much On Story",7,12 June 2016,"Robbie K back again, and this time with the third review of the week. This installment focuses on yet another sequel to grace the silver screen and one I never expected, or wanted, to come. My review is on Now You See Me 2, as you can guess from my posting, an attempt to follow up on the successful thriller from 2013. But can this film follow a truly great act? Or is this merely another money making scheme whose name overshadows the quality. Let's get to the review to find out. If you remember the first movie, it was a crime/thriller with an underlying mystery that came to a well-concluded end. Natural, come up with an even more intriguing mystery and throw in a little vengeance on top of that. Now You See Me 2 takes place merely a year after the last installment and focuses on uncovering the mystery of the Eye, the organization that recruited our ""heroes"" in the first installment, who may have set them up for failure. The plot is certainly intriguing, and the team manages to throw those famous curve balls we saw in the first film. While the mystery isn't quite as good as the first one, and the thrills are a bit stale, it makes for an intriguing story nonetheless. My mind was constantly trying to decipher how deep the rabbit hole went and just who was in cahoots when it came to dismantling the team. In addition, they added some of the character development that the last installment lacked, some of which was good and some of which was cornier than a corn maze at a harvest festival. Outside of the mystery, the vengeance part is so-so in terms of quality. Multiple people have a vendetta against our crew and they go through extraordinary lengths to get it done. However, one of the new characters Walter (Daniel Radcliffe) was not the villain to do so and was more annoying than menacing. Regardless the plot against them wasn't as suspenseful and a mediocre attempt to try and keep you on your seats as if there were harm to your characters. I applaud them at the good attempt, and appreciate the somewhat emotional twist at the end (which made some of the events in the first movie irrelevant), the vengeance plot was merely a scaffolding for impressive stunts. But it's the stunts and magic that really draw the eye in this film. Like the last installment, number 2 has plenty of convoluted plans that show some serious imagination and cleverness. Fans will be pulled into the confusion of how the gang ended up where they were, only to be wowed by the thorough explanation of how the trick was pulled off. When you pull in the fantastic use of CGI, the stunts only get more impressive as our magicians disappear in ways you only dream about. But again the realistic factor sometimes gets drowned out when a convenient opening appears for our group to take (e.g. a box magically collapsing, a trap door in the middle of a crowded street, or a mirror suddenly appearing). These moments are again cool, but a bit eye rolling when they wrap it up with one sentence, which boils down to ""we wanted something cool, but we could only do it sloppily."" Overall though, these stunts prove imagination is not dead, and that originality can come in the simplest forms. In terms of the casting this is another major strength of the movie. Eisenberg reprises his role as Atlas who still has the chip on his shoulder and ego issues. The snarky comments are fun and funny, but for once I felt it was a bit diluted compared to some of his other roles. Woody Harrelson as the hypnotist was a grand addition and provided some of the funniest moments on the screen with his banter and dialogue. The jokes get a bit tired, but all in all his role in this film has greatly improved. Dave Franco took a bigger role in this one, bringing humor, looks, and a charming story that I really enjoyed. And Mark Ruffalo, well a little sappier and less humor, but it works on a different level than his original character. As for newcomer Lula (Lizzy Caplan) at first she was annoying and too over acted (an attempt at using the shallow comedy for laughs), but then she grew on me and started becoming a much more integral cog into the mix. As for Radcliffe, the actor is still solid in his abilities, but the direction of his character was more whiny brat than anything else and somewhat of a waste of his talents (think Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 movie). Despite the flaws though, the cast really supports one another and makes for an entertaining team. Overall Now You See Me 2 is a fun, entertaining sequel that I enjoyed. The stunts are exciting, the plans convoluted, and the acting is top notch on most grounds. While the story isn't quite as thrilling, and there are components that didn't work for me, it still outshines most of the stuff that hits the theaters these days. I recommend a theater visit for this one as well, but you'll probably get the most out of your money if you rent in about three months. Regardless, enjoy the show and may it be as entertaining to you as it was for me. My scores: Action/Comedy/Thriller: 8 Movie Overall: 7",Now You See Me 2
53,Kingslaay,The magic is gone in this sequel,6,21 April 2017,"I was very excited to see Now You See Me 2 because the first film was fantastic and exceeded expectations. Surely they would have enough magic to make a great sequel. However it was not the case, the film was respectable on its own but a poor follow up to the first film. After the triumph of the first film they didn't need to and shouldn't have made another film. The first film ended off perfectly. It would be nice if for once Hollywood wasn't so concerned with making money and cared about the integrity of a film and any legacy it might have. You don't see Christopher Nolan making Inception 2?This film lacked the magic that occurred in the first film. It was predictable which is the worst thing that can occur for a film about magic and mystery. Lizzie Caplan was a terrible addition to the horseman and it just didn't work. Worst thing is the poor plot, you went from a good one in the first to a thin weak one.",Now You See Me 2
54,Matt_Layden,"""We are going out with a show people will never forget.""",6,13 June 2016,"Now You See Me 2 wins the title for most unnecessary sequel, maybe of all time. The first film was a surprise with decent twists and performances. It was a success, apparently to the point where the studio thought the audience needed more. We didn't and this film doesn't really offer anything new and it expects us to really be invested in these characters and their story. Yet neither of these things are really compelling enough for a second go-around. As a result, this sequel just manages to be serviceable.The Horsemen are in hiding and the FBI are on the hunt for them. It's been over a year and now the stage is set for their triumphant return. Just when they reappear in the limelight, the trick seems to be on them. Their entire stage was hijacked and they find themselves at the mercy of Walter, a mad genius who needs their skills to steal a microchip. In this battle of wits, which magician has the upper hand?I begged my wife to see The Conjuring 2, but she was terrified of the original and absolutely did not want to see the sequel in theatres. Double that for the fantasy adventure film Warcraft, so we were stuck seeing the magic heist flick Now You See Me 2...why this wasn't called Now You Don't, me and millions of others apparently will never know. Most of the cast has returned with the exception of Isla Fisher and Mélanie Laurent, with the former disappearance explained away with a few bits of dialogue. In her place we have Lizzy Caplan, who seems a lot more at ease with the cast and the material. One of the welcomed additions to this sequel. While the original was somewhat refreshing, this one treads the same waters. I was pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns the original offered us, here everything is telegraphed and predicted a few scenes beforehand. Thus the magic is gone, to a degree. The spectacle is still there is some sequences, yet the revelation is timid. I had to stop thinking about logic a lot of times in order to enjoy the spectacle. One sequence involving the team throwing a card between each other to keep it hidden from people inspecting them, was really well done. But why do they need to throw it to each other? Why not just have one of them keep it and continuously hide it? I don't know. Double goes for a plot hole that I simply do not understand involving a fake chip and the real one. NYSM2 doesn't bother to explain much that makes sense and instead tries to explain what we already know. As I said before, Caplan is the one good addition the film does. Most of the cast seems to sleepwalk through their roles, especially Eisenberg. The second new addition is Daniel Radcliffe, who despite playing a ""magician"" does his best to shed that Harry Potter persona. Between his role in Horns, here and the upcoming Swiss Army Man, I hope he manages to do it. NYSM2 is again, a pointless sequel that manages to entertain enough to warrant a view if you're a fan of the original.",Now You See Me 2

Not to mention the twists & cleverness about the film which made the first one also great! The acting & plotting was pretty good too! Their were some parts which got me a bit lost but weren't really confusing as the film itself was like a magic trick as a whole designed to make you think the opposite while working out how they done the tricks too!I'd say it's slightly more fun & creative than the first but couldn't pan the first as it was also great & well put together as well! This film see the return of Morgan Freeman which was good as I was wondering what the film was going to entail with him in it as he was arrested at the end of the first film. This sequel carry's on the story but with several revelations & twists that we thought otherwise in the predecessor. It was clever how it all worked out & how the film pulled off some tricks I never saw coming!The end finale was probably the biggest part I loved about this film! It was just truly epicness just like what I felt with the first Now You See Me! I won't spoil it as it got me first time round!This is a really underrated film with great twists & turns you'll never see coming & the great ending to the film in which you'll be blown away by!I overall enjoyed this sequel & thought it was worth the wait!

58,Gislef,Do You Like Con Shows?,8,28 December 2020,"How much you like 'Now You See Me 2' depends on how much you like 'Leverage', 'Mission: Impossible', 'The Sting', 'Maverick', etc. The protagonists are magician, but so was Rollin Hand in the early seasons of 'M:I'. And most cons rely on the same thing the magicians do here: make the mark(s) look in one direction, and pull off their tricks in a different direction.'NYSM2' is just a con movie, but with the various magicians filling in the con roles. They toss a computer chip around on a playing card, but that isn't any different from a bunch of pickpockets pulling the same scam at the end. And the ""throw 'em out the airplane' gag at the end is the kind of thing you'd see in most of those shows.The cast is likeable enough, and the bad guys are swarmy jerks. Almost everyone snarks, but that's pretty typical for this type of genre.Woody Harrelson doesn't have much to do except provide some ""hypnosis"" and goofiness. Which is probably why they gave his character a twin brother, who the fact that he's a twin brother really doesn't _do_ anything. Caplan and Radcliffe, as the newcomers, are pretty good. Freeman and Caine are the old-timers, who are okay. Eisenberg is his usual self. Franco doesn't have much to do. Everyone else is... there, but don't make a big splash.Overall, the movie is entertaining. It's not as convoluted as some of those aforementioned shows' plots: it's a little dumbed-down for a 21st century audience. And it's got all of the usual American theatrical plot points: Dylan is still avenging his father, and ""this time it's personal!"" what with Caine and thus Radcliffe's characters looking for payback. But you'll have to pay attention, and some of the ""stage magic"" isn't. Like Atlas and Wilder disappearing in puddles of water/flinging cards, etc.But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

The main cast was the same as the original, except Isla Fisher, who was replaced by Lizzy Caplan, the script was probably written over a lunch meeting, and the sets were bright and noisy, probably to avoid how little acting was going on.

64,Stephen_A_Abell,A Farfetched Sequel... Not As Enjoyable Or Magical As The Original...,6,11 September 2019,"What made the first film so good hinders this sequel. Trying to rival the original story's complexity, ingenuity, and content the writers, Ed Solomon and Peter Chiarelli, decided to go down the ancient secret organisation route. This makes it similar to John Wick's universe, though it's not handled so well. Whereas it's assassins in Wick, it's magicians and tricksters who are the secret hero watchmen.You can just about believe a group of five people trying to make the world a better place. But make this into a shadow agency... of magicians and you're asking a lot of your audience. Also making it a continuation of the original instead of a new stand-alone story wasn't the best of ideas. Especially when you start to change the morality of the characters.The director, Jon M Chu, does a fantastic job with the mess the writers gave him. In particular the electronic skeleton key theft. On paper, and in your mind, this entire routine is ridiculous in its absurdity. However, in Chu's hands, it comes off respectfully and almost believable. In truth, it's Chu who is the glue to this film. Without his, or similar directors, deft touch this movie would have been dire indeed.The acting is passable, though only Eisenberg and Harrelson go the extra distance. Eisenberg is spot-on as the assertive, confident, and powerful showman. Harrelson adds an extra dimension by also playing Merritt's twin brother and ex-partner Chase. He pulls the two personalities perfectly. The way they play off each other is great. It's Freeman, Caine, and Radcliffe that are the weaker actors. This could be down to the writing of the characters or how the director saw them. Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley isn't as well constructed in the sequel. I think this is down to the fact that he's now a minor background character. Caine does his Caine thing, though it would have been nice to see a softer side when he's with his son. Radcliffe doesn't do bad guy. In fact, with the beard he sports, I'm amazed the horsemen weren't rolling on the floor with laughter. If you have that amount of money wouldn't you have a well-styled and trimmed set of whiskers?I would only recommend that you watch this film if you've watched and enjoyed the original. If you haven't seen the first yet, get it watched - it's a good movie - then, only if you're at a loose end with nothing to watch, you can give this a try. It's not as good, though on a cold wet afternoon it isn't a bad alternative to a soaking bicycle ride.",Now You See Me 2
65,sergelamarche,Now I've seen it,4,10 February 2018,Agree with the critics here. Empty film full of magic tricks. The only fun is to guess how or what. The big crowds cheering make no sense at all.,Now You See Me 2
66,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Still enjoyable with the same bag of tricks.,7,8 March 2019,"Sometimes the enjoyment of a particular film almost guarantees I'll go to see the sequel. Now You See Me 2 (2016) is no exception. I really liked Now You See Me (2013) because the genres of ""magic"" and ""heist"" merge so easily together. Now three years later, and I certainly looked forward to this sequel, despite not knowing how the plot could advance any further than it had at the end of the first film.While the sequel did not disappoint, with numerous illusions, plenty of action, and loads of comedy, it felt like it was the same old gimmick as the original. Sure, there was a little more exploration into ""the Eye"", but most of the plot of the second film centered on the consequences of the robberies from the first film (almost weighing it down, in my opinion). The addition of Daniel Radcliffe as a winking nod to his Harry Potter character was fun as a reveal, but didn't offer much in terms of plot development. In fact, I almost liked Woody Harrelson playing twin brothers more, but that's likely due to the comedic value.Unfortunately, because Now You See Me 2 focused almost entirely on the background of Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), I felt it was held back to its full potential. None of the other characters really grew that much, but they were rewarded for working together (after running into a few snags), much like they did in their first appearance on screen. Don't get me wrong, the formula works for me and I was entertained, but maybe this franchise would have been better served as a TV series instead of a potential film trilogy.Still enjoyable with the same bag of tricks, I give Now You See Me 2 3.5 stars out of 5.",Now You See Me 2
67,RforFilm,"Now You See Me 2 improves with some new tricks, but creates new problems for it's show",5,15 June 2016,"It's one thing to produce fantasy where wizards can produce magical energy to fight or resurrect the dead with a spell, but something else when your portraying stage magicians. One major rule when making a movie about these illusionists is that no computer-generated imagery can be used what so ever. Part of the reason that translating the stories of magicians to cinema is that the awe of the tricks are from witnessing them live. Adding a camera adds a sense of cynicism that a simple white rabbit out of a top hat could have been done using editing rather then hand trickery. Ironically, much of whatever's added in film to make things more magical suddenly takes away the wonder.The Prestige from Christopher Nolan seems to be the best movie out there about magicians. But when most people think about cinematic illusionists, they think about the 2013 film, Now You See Me. The movie had some interesting ideas, but I found the four horsemen too perfect for their own good. They didn't connect with me, but it did with audiences and was a hit (you have to give the movie credit for being original AND a hit). Now You See Me 2 continues the escapades of the four (in this case five) horsemen.Set a year after the events of the first movie, the horsemen, hypnotist Merritt (played by Woody Harrelson) street magician Atlas (played by Jessie Eisenberg), card handler Jack (played by Dave Franco), and newcomer May (played by Lizzy Caplan) have been in hiding, waiting for their next move from the Eye, the magician society they were recruited into before. With their leader FBI agent Dylan (played by Mark Ruffalo), they are assigned to expose a corrupt businessman whose software can steal data from users. They hijack the launch party, but are interrupted by a unseen individual who reveals that Dylan is in on the four horsemen. The magicians escape, but are unexpectedly taken and brought to Macau. They are brought in front of tech prodigy Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) who used to work with the same business that the horsemen tried to expose. They are given orders to steal the software chip from a secret facility under a casino. The heist goes well, but Mabry turns the tables on them and steels the chip back for his own benefit. Upon finding out that Mabry is the son of Arthur (played by Michael Caine), they travel to London to plan their next act to finally put an end to these villains.I'll say that I liked Now You See Me 2 as much as the last filmwhich was okay. It's not the same thoughts though as while they fixed some problems I had before, but accidentally create new ones. While the four horsemen are still too perfect as heroes, Mark Ruffalo gets some more background and becomes a surprising interesting character to follow. This film continues the heist theme, which seems like a good plan, but a lot of the story gets complicated.A lot of that has to do with the fact the idea of steeling a computer chip has been done hundreds of times before in film, so why should I care about this one? The villains' plans are just as predictable as it's just take over the world. Finally, some of the magic tricks are cool and visually neat (not as much CGI this time), but it requires a major suspension of disbelief. I doubt David Copperfield and Sigfried & Roy could have come up with some of these tricks in just one day. I'll give this five joker card out of ten. If you liked the last movie, you'll probably like this too. It's too much ""movie"" for me to get into. What I mean by that is I wish I could be seeing these tricks live rather then watch it in a movie. Though there are some tricks, the overall treat just isn't to my taste.",Now You See Me 2

The airplane stunt was fun.The movie feels too long. The cast is so well known it is hard to see them as their characters in the movie. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is Michael Caine. Mark Ruffalo got angry enough to turn into The Hulk but he didn't.In the first movie of this title we were in the gambling capital of Nevada. This time we are supposed to be in Macaw, the gambling capital of Asia. The movie plays well on the big screen and will play very well on home platforms.

69,bankofmarquis,"Miss the ""magic"" of the first, but still entertaining",7,14 June 2016,"I really enjoyed the first NOW YOU SEE ME film. I thought that film's premise ""magicians robbing a bank"" was original and the execution of the unique script by Ed Solomon and Boaz Yakin by director Louis Leterrier was strong. Add to that the casting - Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco as ""The Four Horseman"", Melanie Laurent, Common and (especially) Mark Ruffalo as the cops who were chasing them and sprinkle in good ol' Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman into a plot that kept you guessing to the end and you had a fun ride.My only question was, could the sequel capture the...wait for it...MAGIC (yes I went there) of the original?And my answer is...sort of.Kind of like seeing a magic show for the 2nd time, the spark of originality and wonderment was mostly missing this time around, consequently NOW YOU SEE ME 2 turned into a fairly standard crime/action caper - but with magic instead of guns, cars or fights. All that said, I was still entertained by this film, but that enjoyment was filled with an undercurrent of disappointment as I wanted to by ""wowed"" like I was with the first film.The script - written by Ed Solomon, one of the writers of the original, struck me as a ""job script"", that is, a script written for money from the studio vs. a ""passion script"" where the author has an idea they are passionate about and that passion is shown on the screen. Add to that the fact that Jon M.Chu - director of GI JOE: RETALIATION (not exactly CITIZEN KANE) - helmed this film and you have a movie that feels professional, competent and workman-like.What saves this movie is the performances. Three of the horsemen are back (Isla Fisher had to bow out due to a pregnancy) and the bi- play and the interaction between Eisenberg, Harrelson and Franco fits like an old glove. They get to interact with Ruffalo more in this film and that's a plus. Freeman and Caine return and are as dependable as ever and newcomers Daniel Radcliffe, Tsai Chin and (especially) Jay Chou were fun. Only Lizzy Caplan's Lula didn't really work for me - I thought she was trying to hard to fill in for Fisher.Interestingly enough, I could shake the feeling, as I was watching this film, that I was watching the 2nd chapter in a trilogy, even though this one did NOT end in a cliffhanger. Sure enough, upon further review, NOW YOU SEE ME 3 is currently filming.All in all, I enjoyed this film, I just wish I could have been surprised more, like I was in the first film.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Now You See Me 2
70,Anurag-Shetty,As magical & entertaining as its predecessor.,8,7 July 2016,"Now You See Me 2 continues with the story of, The Four Horsemen. One year after outsmarting the FBI, The Four Horsemen reemerge for an unforgettable comeback performance. Apart from J. Daniel Atlas(Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney(Woody Harrelson) & Jack Wilder(Dave Franco), the Horsemen get a new addition to their team named, Lula(Lizzy Caplan). However, during their comeback magic show, things don't go according to plan. Now, The Four Horsemen are forced to work for a tech genius. The Horsemen will have to do what they do best & pull off their most difficult heist yet, using their signature illusions. Now You See Me 2 is a superb film. It is as good as Now You See Me(2013). Director Jon M. Chu has successfully retained the magic of the original movie. The magic tricks performed in this film, are mind-bending & look fantastic. They surpass the illusions in the first movie. There are quite a few twists & turns in the film, to keep you guessing as to what is going to happen next. This is in keeping with the suspense element of the first film. The action element, is a welcome addition to the sequel. The magic trick involving the stick, is the highlight of the movie. Jesse Eisenberg is great as J. Daniel Atlas. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Dylan Rhodes. Woody Harrelson is awesome as Merritt McKinney. Dave Franco is impressive as Jack Wilder. Daniel Radcliffe is amazing as Walter Mabry. Lizzy Caplan is hilarious as Lula. Jay Chou is good as Li. Michael Caine is fantastic as Arthur Tressler. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Thaddeus Bradley. Sanaa Lathan, David Warshofsky & Tsai Chin are effective as Deputy Director Natalie Austin, Agent Cowan & Bu Bu, respectively.

71,agmoldham,A bit hard to follow,5,15 July 2016,First of all must come clean and say that I've not seen the original Now you see me movie. It was only the 2 in the title that gave away this was a sequel to me and didn't know anything at all about the movie beforehand.It turns out that it's a movie about a group of magicians called the Horsemen who perform spectacular magic acts to expose rich people exploiting people. Think that pretty much covers the plot. The film is at it's best when there are scenes of the magicians trying to outdo each other. The first scene which introduces the new horseman Lula (Lizzy Caplan) is an example of this. Overall it's a pretty incoherent script though which may be partly explained by the fact that I hadn't seen the first film. Maybe a second viewing would make things a little clearer although on balance I can't be bothered. If you like magic and enjoyed the original film then sure you'll enjoy this. If not you'll probably be somewhat puzzled like me.,Now You See Me 2

But the magic tricks, like the CGI is not clever, but showy, as we all know this will always be CGI and the magic illusion of cinema. In other words it is all polish and no substance.

75,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,6 August 2017,"I expected a movie similar to the first one: a lot of big flashy moments, fast-paced, well acted and without making any sense sometimes. However, this time, it didn't work out. All of the big moments are easily forgotten in the next scene because they don't do anything for the movie, they're just there. Also, the post- production of this movie is horrible, there are a lot (really, a lot) of editing mistakes throughout the movie, where people are standing in one position in one scene and right in the next cut they're completely different. I usually don't look for this type of error in a film, but when they're too much, it becomes kind of annoying (especially for a 100M$ budget).Mark Ruffalo as Dylan Rhodes carries the entire movie, he is the only one with an actual purpose to be there. All the others are fine, they just don't have anything worth mentioning ... Except for Woody Harrelson. He plays both Merritt McKinney and his twin brother and, not because of the actor himself, but it didn't go well. Actually, it's terrible, I have no idea what they were thinking when they cast him for the twin brother as well because this character is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen ... And they kept having him in most scenes! He's like an Ewok or Jar Jar Binks (Star Wars) ...Still, the movie has a good start, it gives Mark Ruffalo's character a heartfelt backstory, but then it starts to crumble. While in the first movie, they only had some scenes that didn't make sense, this one it's full of it. All of the magic tricks that they explain, I don't need an explanation for, they are obvious because of the hints they kept giving. Now, explain how Jesse Eisenberg's character disappears by falling and transforming himself into water. I'm not a skeptical guy, I love mystery movies, but this one wants to be realistic ... Using CGI magic.You can watch this movie, it's entertaining and it's mostly fast- paced.

76,CANpatbuck3664,Now You See Me 2 is a Fun Heist Movie That Doesn't Quite Live Up To It's Promise,7,26 June 2016,"The first Now You See Me was a genuine pleasant surprise. I remember it came out and not much was expected from it. It was going up against a couple of other movies coming out that weekend. But it did pretty well and the movie was fun overall. It was a decent heist movie and the characters that they created were cool and you wanted to see more of them. I would have gave the first one an 8/10. I don't know if anyone really needed a sequel to NYSM, it worked as a standalone but with the money it made, of course there would be a sequel. I was happy to go see it and I had a good time but in terms of building off the first one, this one falls flat in similar places and doesn't fulfill the promise that the ending of the original set up.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin with an introduction from the villain from NYSM 1 Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). He tells us how The Horsemen J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher who does not appear in this movie) took the world by storm. Their magic astounded the world and they became Robin Hood like figures, taking down corrupt businessmen including Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) and rewarding their followers. With the help of the mysterious organization The Eye (supposedly an organization of master magicians who use their talents to help the collective good) they were able to evade the FBI including agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and make a successful getaway. Since their disappearance in New York, they have been in hiding and the world hungers for their return. Unfortunately, they got away and left someone else holding the bag which was Thaddeus who is still in jail having been setup by the Horsemen in the finale of NYSM.We then flash to Daniel running through the sewers of New York. He comes to a special chamber where he talks to a voice who claims to represent The Eye. Atlas and crew have been in hiding much longer than they expected to be and are tired of biding their time by practising. They have also gotten tired of the passive tactics of their leader *spoiler for NYSM* Dylan and it is alluded to that Daniel thinks he can do better. The voice tells Atlas to be patient, that he will get his chance and that there is an upcoming opportunity for them to return.The first Now You See Me was a heist movie that tried to do something different rather than a team of car thieves or a team of con men, it was a team of magicians and it was cool to see a different perspective on it. They also brought some interesting and fun to watch magic tricks. This one also brings that element. Sure, not everything that they can do can actually be done but I was willing to forgive that as long as they moved at a quick clip and kept it light, which they did. We do that with other big budget heist movies or superhero movies so if you can ignore the physics, there's good times to be had.Not only are the tricks that they perform pretty sweet but the chemistry between the crew is strong. While I'm going to criticize the writing later, the dialogue is pretty good and the sense of ""family"" that you get with the Fast and Furious franchise (which they might be trying to borrow from) is present.They've got quite a cast here too and they all perform well. Jesse Eisenberg is well suited to his role and he excels as the leader in these movies. Dave Franco is actually given room in this franchise to perform by himself and he also does well. Woody Harrelson is his normal excellent self (I have issues with his dual role but it's not the fault of his acting). Lizzy Caplan is a good fit to fill in for Isla Fisher, she's got good comedic timing and her character is given more personality (I liked Fisher in the original but she's not given much to do outside of working with the group). Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all come back and are all solid, there's a reason that they are some of the best. I liked Daniel Radcliffe in his role too, it's very self aware casting but he doesn't overdo it as the villain. He does just enough and I'm happy he's getting more and more franchise roles.Getting to what I didn't like, one of the reasons that Now You See Me worked is that it was pretty unpredictable and fresh up until the end. I'm sad to say that NYSM 2 fails there. Certain things are introduced and it's really obvious how it's going to play into the story later. They write certain twists that are obvious from miles away. How they make one of the original cast play a dual role was really lame. It was really too bad, this movie was close to being something great but more time needed to be spent really smoothing out the rougher parts of the script. It just felt a little rushed so if there is a NYSM 3, hopefully there's a tighter product.To wrap it up, while there's too many twists and turns and the end is convoluted, unlike NYSM which fizzles towards the end, at least NYSM 2 provides a satisfying payoff. But I wanted to like this movie more than I did. There were moments when it absolutely lives up to the first but how the plot flows cuts it out at the ankles. I would still recommend it to fans of the original as it's far from bad. It's just not the complete package and for me it was a slight disappointment.",Now You See Me 2
77,nicholls_les,Big Disappointment,3,26 June 2017,"I was hoping that the makers of this movie would have learned from the mistakes of the first one. The first movie was almost good but overdid the unrealistic aspects of the so called illusions. This one went even further in the wrong direction. The concept of these movies is a good one and magic and illusions can fascinate the viewer, however this does not do that in any way. The characters are very one dimensional and are totally unconvincing as magicians. There are some good actors in here that could not save what was a poor story with even worse direction. It would have been good if they had a better plot and illusions rather than both being completely silly and not in any way clever or impressive. Maybe they should have watched some Penn and Teller, David Blaine or Dynamo to get some good ideas for dramatic illusions that could actually work. Will I watch the third one? Maybe when the DVD gets reduced to a pound but otherwise no.",Now You See Me 2
78,cinemamoviecars,a unexpected good sequel,10,10 September 2021,"Yes, nobody was expecting the second part, the good thing is that this movie make the world of the first movie bigger, and theres more danger and more magic.Wish they made this the next big franchise.",Now You See Me 2
79,PyroSikTh,"Too Many Twists, Not Enough Magic",6,5 July 2016,"As far as the story goes, there is actually a lot of potential in Now You See Me 2. It's not long before Rhodes has to give up his role in the FBI and focus entirely on being a Horseman, there's a handful of new players in addition to Lulu, and almost everyone from the first movie returns (although the Interpol agent isn't even mentioned). There's plenty of twists at play in this movie. Too many in my opinion. Rather than build-up mystery and intrigue, it just throws twist after twist at you. Some of them are great, some of them are awful (great being the identity of the new villain's father, awful being the figurehead of The Eye; the mysterious organisation of magicians).Similarly some of the new characters are great, while others are awful. I was sad to hear that Isla Fisher wasn't returning as Henley. There's a reasonably plausible explanation as to why she's not around, but I'd rather have still had her around, even if it was in a reduced capacity or cameo. That said, Lizzy Caplan's Lulu is a worthy replacement. She adds a lot of much needed energy and quirkiness to the group that, without her, would have seemed incredibly dull and uninteresting. I'd probably go so far as to say she's the best character of the whole movie. With all the antagonists of the first movie out the way, Now You See Me 2 needed a new one, and Daniel Radcliffe's Walter Mabry is brilliant. Just like Caplan, he brings a surprising amount of energy to the movie, and his borderline sociopathic villain makes for a brilliant foil.Then there's Chase McKinney, Merritt's twin brother, also played by Woody Harrelson, who is a dreadful and pointless addition. He's Harrelson at his most goofy and annoying, and that awful wig certainly doesn't help. Not only that, but he serves no purpose in the movie, no purpose that couldn't have been served by someone else at least. The best comparison I can think of to a similar character is Alfrid in The Battle of Five Armies, who's only purpose was to bring cringeworthy and completely humourless comedy to an otherwise fairly serious movie, cheapening the whole experience.The returning cast are all back to what they do best, and honestly I'm surprised that even if they did all phone it in for the paycheck, it's not immediately obvious. Mark Ruffalo probably gets the most opportunity to add depth to his character of Dylan Rhodes, particularly after his status quo completely shifts early on. Morgan Freeman chews up the scenery as usual as a personal antagonist to Rhodes, and they share some great scenes together. Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, and Woody Harrelson all do great as the rest of the horsemen, but they sorely lacked any character development at all, resulting in each of their characters becoming little more than empty shells trundled around at behest of the plot.The real draw for me, and I'm sure many others too, was the magic tricks. These imaginative and fluid tricks made the first movie so enjoyable, even when they flirted with the plainly unbelievable, giving it that edge of pure fantasy that I really dug. Now You See Me 2 is a bit of a disappointment in that regard, as there isn't really a whole lot of magic. Their first show back is thwarted before they really get to do much (although I admit the build-up was entertaining). Beyond little easter eggs and teases here and there, that's it until the third act. Okay, we get an entertaining exchange of cards in a high security lab between them, but it goes on entirely too long (seriously, how many times can you search one body over and over), and is ultimately pointless, because they seem to just keep passing the card to the person next being searched, when really the first guy should've kept hold of it after cleverly keeping it out of sight. When we do get a promise of some magic, they almost always get interrupted. What was great last time was seeing these tricks play out to their end and the Horsemen getting away with it. This time they never get to finish anything as Mabry's men or the police always seem to barge in, and any getaways they have are similarly thwarted with ease. When they all coalesced onto motorcycles I sat up in my seat ready for a nailbiting car chase through the streets of London, but they don't even get out of the car park. The imaginative and well-prepared Horsemen seem to get outsmarted constantly this time, and that was just frustrating.I enjoyed Now You See Me 2 for the most part, and I am eager to see the third instalment if it gets made, but I can't deny that this second movie was a bit of a mess. It had far too many twists and turns, returning characters became dull and indistinguishable (somehow), and the fun of grand magic was completely absent. The action benefited a lot from John M Chu and his history of highly choreographed movies, but he was near useless at handling anything else the script threw at him I give Now You See Me 2 a slightly disappointing 6/10.P.S. I still can't believe they didn't call it ""Now You See Me Too"" or ""Now You Don't"". Even the original title of ""Now You See Me: The Second Act"" would have been a bit more imaginative.",Now You See Me 2

83,LloydBayer,NYSM2 is a literal and fatal misdirection with little in the way of fresh excitement.,4,15 June 2016,"Anyone who has seen Christopher Nolan's cerebral masterwork in The Prestige will recall that a magic trick consists of three acts. Typically, this involves the 'setup' where the nature of the trick is explained, the 'performance' where the magician applies misdirection to fool the audience, and finally the 'effect' of the illusion on said audience. At no point will a magician reveal the secret behind the effect. So despite its critical consensus of style over substance, 2013's Now You See Me turned out to be a popular hit precisely due to the performance and misdirection applied. It was cheesy fun and at times nail bitingly good but we wanted to be fooled and we were.Picking up roughly a year after the events of the first film, Now You See me 2 seeks to bring back the pizazz of its predecessor with more twists, turns, noise and nonsense. That's not necessarily a bad thing and while it's fairly traditional to harvest the merit of an original, NYSM2 as a sequel suffers in continuity owing to a poorly conceived setup. A result of which has the returning A-list cast embroiled in a save-the-world technology heist, ala international espionage styled thriller. With the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan (replacing Isla Fisher), the Horsemen are now required to pull off a high security job reserved for the likes of Ethan Hunt. And as absurd as that sounds, the idea of a hi-tech heist using street magic is quickly overrun by expository plot points in the form of flashbacks. No surprise then that however baffling a trick might seem, Morgan Freeman's celestial voice talent is always ready to narrate the secret. It doesn't help either that most of the other actors struggle with characters that lack any semblance to the previous film; Jesse Eisenberg included. Also lacking, albeit severely, is the on-stage showmanship of the Horsemen that made them famous in the first place. Instead, new director Jon M. Chu's outlandish approach is in laying the foundation for a trilogy – much like the Oceans 11, 12, 13 franchise but with smoke, shadow, mirrors and identical twins. In part, this plays out by pitting head Horsemen Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) against Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley, a magic debunker with ulterior motives. While this incubates a backstory of tragedy and vengeance, it also detracts from the central theme of magic and those show stopping illusions that we actually came to see. To its merit, the inclusion of Daniel Radcliffe adds a whimsy twist to this sequel. Radcliffe is no stranger to magic but we get to see him play a creepy Bond-like villain in a bizarre father-son relationship with main villain Tressler (Michael Caine). Other developments include Woody Harrelson in a double role with equally bizarre if not intended comic interjections. And poof! Everything else goes out the window, rabbit and hat in tow. With legendary illusionist David Copperfield serving as production consultant, NYSM2 should have turned out better than the first film. But on its own there is little in the way of fresh excitement, let alone not more than two main illusions. And undermining the entire concept of films about magic, at no point are we fooled into believing what we see either. Ultimately it all comes down to the arduous task of direction, or in this case, a literal and fatal misdirection but without the intended effect. Fans of the first film might find themselves in a giddy bag of tricks. For the rest, it's like watching a street magician perform with Parkinson's disease.",Now You See Me 2

This creates it's own space and provides a more fitting role for Woody Harrelson to fit in. The nature of the film, however, will disappoint young, naive magic fans who came for Daniel Radcliffe.What makes this different from a magic or tech film is that it combines the 2 and goes further, mixing in international intrigue and national security issues. As a result, we have something like Edward Snowden meets David Copperfield (who is a co-producer).Whether there's a trilogy now or not, this fulfills the promise of the first film and can leave us content with the series.",Now You See Me 2
86,ericrnolan,"A very short review of ""Now You See Me 2"" (2016)",7,22 March 2017,"My enthusiasm for ""Now You See Me's"" hero magicians waned just a bit after seeing last year's sequel. It was fun enough, though, so I'd give it a 7 out of 10.Much of my enjoyment was hampered here by the use of an overly convenient plot device that was also utterly ridiculous — one of the ""Four Horsemen"" protagonists can simply employ hypnosis to persuade anybody to do anything. It seems like a godlike power, and it feels like a pretty big cheat on the part of the screenwriter. (I think anyone familiar with hypnosis knows it absolutely doesn't work as depicted here, anyway.)If even one of the protagonists has this ability, why do they need to employ legerdemain to commit or stop crimes in the first place? Instead of disguises or sleight-of-hand, couldn't they just program unwilling confederates to do everything for them, at minimal risk to themselves? And why steal anything in a conventional sense, if they can just brainwash a target into ""giving"" it to them?Like the first film, though, ""Now You See Me 2"" is entertaining, if you take it as an escapist fantasy. It's still a pretty creative premise, and it's still nice and funny. (The exception is a bunch of jokes connected with a twin brother for Woody Harrelson's character. The character, also played by Harrelson, was annoying and creepy enough to make me cringe.)One nice addition to this film was Lizzy Caplan as the new female ""horseman"" after the departure of actress Isla Fisher.

88,James_De_Bello,4/10,4,8 June 2016,"""Now You See Me"" was a personal guilty pleasure of 2013, it was absolutely unpretentious and unbelievable but it knew it was so and with the help of a talented cast and a couple of good characters and story beats it turned out as a fine time at the theater. Its sequel starts out with the same unpretentious and fun vibe of the first only to slowly escalate up to what becomes one of the most lifeless and visually painful experiences of the year.As I said the movie started out really fine, in the sense that it was doing what I wanted it to do. Nobody should or would walk into this film expecting the new ""Heat"", I just wanted to have some dumb fun, with a self referential film that doesn't take anything seriously and up to the fist two set-pieces of the film that's what I was getting. The cast was working the best they could and the action felt fluent and visually pleasing, there was a rhythm to it and a reason for it in particular.Yet, as soon as we start getting into this film's second act things fall apart to a mind numbing degree and I mean that literally, my mind went blank with the level of stupidity and inconsequentially of what was going on, I watched this film in a state of trance where I couldn't tell if I was dozing off or simply bored to death.""Now You See Me 2"" takes the levels of suspense of disbelief to a whole new world where not even laughing at the film proves to be of any kind of satisfaction, everything going on is just visual noise and other than being filmed in the most uninteresting and unstylish way possible, it has no momentum, no character, it's just there for the sake of extravaganza and it keeps going on for unbelievable amounts of time and it never proves to be any kind of pleasant.And we haven't even taken into consideration the logistical implications of what happens. It is just crazy. There is no grit of grounding of actions, stuff just keeps happening on top of other stuff and without any kind of character or story implications the film becomes more of a showcase of dull visual tricks. Not to mention the story twists it spices in which are preposterous to even think about and sprinkled with silly clichés and dialogue that not even Ruffalo or Freeman, two of the greatest actors, manage to make even passable.I got a head ache from this movie, it was a terrible experience, I don't recommend it and the shortness of my review is reflective of how lost with words I am about it.",Now You See Me 2
89,scottshak_111,More or less capering around the surface of its prequel,7,21 July 2016,"So, that leaves its wounds open – the way things were in the previous installment. But it manages to work around it with its stunning theatrics, an elusive plot and a pinch of some rad magic to keep us riveted to our seats.NEW INCLUSIONS IN NOW YOU SEE ME 2 Daniel Radcliffe as Walter Mabry is absolutely thrilling, although he doesn't get much to gnaw at. He still manages to make his character interesting. Makes a swell entry! Lizzy Caplan is an awesome find as Lula, a pleasant inclusion to the already stellar cast. Her jocular remarks will make you fall in love with her instantly. Also, she doesn't make you miss Isla Fisher.The director's shaky camera techniques don't really work here, as he decimates action. If it were not for the plot and some cool magic tricks, it would have failed, nay, fell flat on its face in the muck of its own doing.SPOILERS YOU MIGHT SEE COMING: Now You See Me 2 has side-plots, some fine to live with but some really vapid and in need of better framing. Two of the worst ones were the twin tale and the original girdle that bound the movie taut. Even though Woody Harrelson creates a charming façade as his twin, the side story doesn't pack in a big punch. The Morgan Freeman story does, but it simply vexes you forcing you to chase the 'tale'. It is as if Jon M. Chu serves you a revelation hotchpotch, and boom! they keep falling one after the other on you. It seems rather deliberate and pushed to match the lines of the first installment.At times the dialogues of Now You See Me 2 run into the cheesy territory and you feel like laughing at serious moments, like when they team up (which by the way they have always acted as), and they go, ""Who's in?"" and then others follow, ""I am in"", ""Me too"".The side story of Dylan Rhodes, which Mark Ruffalo goes in full-blown acting mode along with Thaddeus Bradley, is a good one but the vendetta never takes place. The final revelation of Now You See Me 2 feels kind of empty even though it was colossal. Maybe it was in dire need of a proper depiction with a revelation theme or something. The way the movie begins, ends the same way opening you to the puns hidden in words which was well thought of. The voice of Morgan does justice to it as well. The Eye still stays as the rudimentary backdrop of the tale, and looks like we have something to look forward to in the long run.MAGIC TRICKS The card trick to steal the stick is stark badass but unfortunately there is too much of it, and it makes you start thinking out loud. There is comparatively lesser magic and more of hypnotism in Now You See Me 2 which kind of defeats the purpose of magic. The best magical majestic bit is the one Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) performs with rain as he tries to play God. Absolutely stunning to watch!

90,coreyjdenford,Not so Magic,4,4 July 2016,"This is my review for Now You See Me 2: The Second Act (spoiler free)** (2/5)Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Lizzy Caplan, Dave Franco, Daniel Radcliffe, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman.Plot: World famous magic act/thieves The Four Horsemen – now with a new member, and under the auspices of uber-magician, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) – find themselves up against a formidable enemy, who seems to know their every moveNormally with magic acts they tend to have an end and sometimes they come back for a second act and it's going to be a lot bigger, not in the case of Now You See Me 2 – which manages to be more stupid than it's flashy and witty predecessor which is the best film in the world compared to this. This movie is definitely not bigger or better than the first act. At the end of the first movie, a charming, and surprise sleeper hit big reveal when Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent Dylan Rhodes who spent the entire movie chasing the flashy thieves/magicians but never quite caught them because they were always ahead of him. So he decided to reveal his biggest secret that he is a magician himself, even that movie had a really convoluted plot but it was actually fun to watch.This film still explores the same characters as the first one along with some new ones; Jesse Eisenberg's Atlas seems to be in an endless squabble with the other characters. Well there is no Henley (Isla Fisher) anymore she is then replaced with fast talking and witty Lula (Lizzy Caplan) and finally joined with Dylan Rhodes who seems to be blaming his father's watery demise on Morgan Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley and that conversation seems to be decades old at this point. As far as this movie keeps brooding on at it's messed up points there are some fun bits well if you can call them fun, Walter Maubry's (Radcliffe) entrance is really cool and you can tell that he is going to be a pretty insane villain (that moment soon dies off) but after he stays on the screen for a long time then his character turns into just another stupid and pointless addition, in a stupid and pointless movie. The more this movie goes on with its ""second act"" business and by the time it gets there it really suggests that they should have stuck with the first act because it was better. The first movie directed by Louis Letterier was fun and flashy. This one, directed by John M.Chu is tepid, even managing to make a lengthy detour in the colourful city of Macau dull. Louis Letterier is nobody's idea of master of magic but next to Chu, he's Penn & Teller or even Harry Houdini. The movie is so strangled by an incredibly convoluted plot, including a spectacularly silly retcon, that the easy repartee of the Horsemen from the original is never recaptured. One can only dream of a much better and hopefully much dynamic film than it really is. Even the Card throwing Jack (Dave Franco) tries to pull them out of endearing situations and tries to pull off another charm that didn't even work in the first movie, let alone in this one. There are moments when the energy surges, such as a sequence where the Horsemen have to work together to conceal a playing card-shaped MacGuffin from the world's worst security guards. By and large though this movie suffers the same fate as another sequelitis, and a sense that nobody's heart is really in it. Take, for example Woody Harrelson's dual role. In what seems like a desperate attempt to give him something interesting to do, he also appears as Merritt's evil twin brother with a crazy and endearing plan, but as he babbles on unwittingly you want to wish that he and his fake mustache should come to an untimely demise. No such fate happens. As this appears to be bigger than the first and believe it or not the final act is actually the best part of the film but unfortunately until that time you have to go through nerve shattering squabbling and once it's finally got, to the final act the whole lead up is worthless. It then turns into whodunit murder case but they already know who did it and if they said that they knew then this movie would have been a lot shorter, unfortunately it wasn't it was just a worthless popcorn movie but with those they are guilty pleasures this was just stupid.Verdict: It's an impressively starry cast, but sadly, this lacks the charm, wit and yes, magic of the original. You'll like it, not a lot or no at all. 4/10 appalling.",Now You See Me 2
91,Ramascreen,Big giant mess!,4,8 June 2016,"Here's the thing about 2013's ""Now You See Me,"" I didn't hate it but I wasn't completely wowed by it either. Mildly entertaining is how I'd describe it. It's heist caper like Ocean's Eleven but with faster sleight of hand. So to say that ""Now You See Me"" didn't have its amusing moments, would be a lie. But this sequel however, NOW YOU SEE ME 2, is a big giant mess.In NOW YOU SEE ME 2, the four horsemen Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzy Caplan, after a year of outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. But a certain revenge plot threatens their impossible heist yet.The first film had more mystery, thriller and intrigue, so at the very least it kept you engaged, but NOW YOU SEE ME 2 resorts to cheap laughs and a build up that frankly kinda insults our intelligence. The film would like to make you believe that it's smart, it even thinks itself that way, but in its attempt to give you a seemingly intricate and elaborate trick and a big reveal, it gets lost in its own process.Isla Fisher's Henley whom I thought was a strong female character, got replaced by Lizzy Caplan's Lula who's more concerned about getting laid. For some reason, they had to present Woody Harrelson's character's identical twin brother, also played by Woody Harrelson. I think that was a poor decision on the filmmakers' part. It's bad enough that they had to resort to this annoying unlikable family member, on top of that, they couldn't just get another actor and have it be a brother, instead of identical twin?! Woody Harrelson is a great actor, but watching two of him bantering, that's the point when I stop taking this movie seriously as a piece of entertainment. This franchise says that the closer you look, the less you see. Well, if you step back a bit, you'll see the big picture that NOW YOU SEE ME 2 is not as crafty as it's cracked up to be.-- Rama's Screen --",Now You See Me 2

97,nicolechan916,Inarticulate,6,24 July 2016,"While the previous film was full of intrigue, mystery, and revelations, this film is a pale comparison to it's prequel. With considerably less action and more talk, the first half of the film manages to bore the audience. As well, this film gives off the feeling of trying too hard to be like the first one that it just falls short.The acting is fine enough for the Horsemen, as they all reprise their roles. I did like Isla Fisher and her character, but unfortunately she got replaced by Lizzy Caplan, who isn't so bad either. I had a problem with Radcliffe's character. He was too weird, and his background was not very comprehensive. I also found out how short he actually is in this film. In addition, the film introduces Merritt's twin brother, Chase, played by Woody Harrelson. That was another no-no. Though the editing was done well enough between the two characters, the hair on 'Chase' was very obviously a wig which was unnerving. Needless to say, I found that the new characters were not a great addition.As for the narrative, it kind of continues the story from the first film, but not in as much detail. As well, there are more elements involved in this film that detracts attention away from the main plot. This is what made it messy; with too many things going on the audience doesn't know which to focus on. And with no focus, the narrative just becomes jumbled up. The effects are cool as usual. I especially liked the scene where they're tossing a card to each other. Visuals and coordination are nicely done there, and managed to engage the audience. The ending felt a little too deja vu from the first one. As mentioned, it tries too hard to be like its predecessor that it just destroys itself. I'm not saying the film is not enjoyable, but while it isn't totally horrible, there is too much dialogue and not enough action. I'd liked to have seen more tricks, and less new characters who hardly had any foundation.",Now You See Me 2

I also thought that it was a bit for fun and entertaining compared to the first movie which got boring for me during the middle and towards the end of that movie. The action and magic scenes were good, although there wasn't that many magic tricks compared to the first movie. Overall, it's a decent movie depending on the type of movies you're into.",Now You See Me 2
99,doorsscorpywag,Garbage,1,20 August 2016,I liked the first one a lot. Even if a bit daft it was fun.This drivel on the other hand was nothing but absolute crap piled on crap. Written probably by a 5 year old it started stupid and by the time it got to the FBI running around London with guns ordering the British police about it had fallen over the precipice of utter b#llocks never to be seen again as anything worthwhile.Rich men hire absolute idiots to look after their security allowing a bunch of so called magicians to magic and hypnotise their way across the globe. The US prison system allows someone to walk in and walk out with a criminal using an FBI ID stolen from another agent. Then Harry Potter turns up and makes the Horsemen steal a chip from a secure facility manned by complete buffoons.Harry seemed under the impression being rich means he can just order a plane into the air anytime he likes without any notice from flight controllers. And firing guns in the street would not attract any attention. And Harry must have never been on a plane before or else he would have noticed it had not taken off even with some shaking and a bit of fake rain.But of course everything was an illusion and all ended well with the FBI arresting the bad guys with their guns in a country they would not be allowed in with those guns let alone take a leading role in any arrest.Meanwhile London bayed like a bunch of cackling chimps at the brilliance of the Horsemen and their improbable plot. The less said about the Morgan Freeman Bruce banner bonding at the end the better.Are Americans really that stupid? Sadly #3 has been announced and who knows what japes these magic folk will get up to.A good example at why films with numbers after them should be burned before release.,Now You See Me 2
100,darkreignn,Disappears from your mind as soon as it's over,4,6 July 2016,"I really love the first ""Now You See Me,"" like, a lot. It's just a really light, breezy, nonstop fun movie, and it knows it. And the trailer for this movie looked like it would be more of the same, which I was completely fine with. Unfortunately, the trailer is infinitely better than the actual film.Honestly, this movie was embarrassing to watch. From the childishly annoying character that Lizzy Caplan plays, to the horrendously unfunny identical twin that Woody Harrelson plays, I was cringing in my seat and praying for deliverance. Now, one could argue that Lizzy Caplan's character was intentionally annoying, and that Woody Harrelson's twin character was intentionally unfunny, and while I would agree with that, it still didn't make for an enjoyable viewing experience, especially when these two characters had a significant amount of screen time.I can't deny that ""Now You See Me 2"" did have some very entertaining sequences, with one particular scene involving an elaborate card trick being the definite highlight of the film. However, these few scenes couldn't save this forgettable mess of a film. I mean honestly, I'm having a hard time writing this review because I can't even remember what I disliked about this movie. It's just a completely forgettable film in every way that will leave your mind as soon as the credits start.Huh, come to think of it, maybe this film did do something right after all: it disappears completely, just like a real magician would.",Now You See Me 2
101,austin0731,some disappointments but at least......,6,18 June 2016,"Now you see me is one of my favourite films of that year and I am very curious in finding out whether it still is any good in this second installment. Firstly Before going into this film I was very disappointed that Isla Fisher is no longer coming back but I was interested in seeing how they would handle that. I was pleasantly surprised with Lizzy Caplan's Lula who may strike annoying at times but seems to handle it just right so it isn't too over the top at times.There were several odd things in this film including Woody Harrelson playing two roles. It was unnecessary and just made it all seem very strange. The film seems to lose some of the fun elements that the original had and is replaced with fast talking and a very sloppy plot. I found it quite predictable at times which makes their efforts of making big reveals seem amazing and unbelievable pretty stupid. However the final act I feel was great and I feel was really what they should have stuck with instead of this dull series of talking, outsmarting and little tricks. The large scale and the tricks I feel is what made me like the first film so much and should have been a larger part of this film. I would expect at least 2 or 3 large scale performances from the horseman.Another more personal problem of the film would center around a minor character played by Jay Chou. Since I am a Taiwanese I payed close attention to Jay Chou's involvement with the production of Now you see me 2. I was disappointed that he was after all apparently just a sales gimmick to sell more tickets to the Asian market. It was ridiculous that His character got around 5 minutes of screen time and around 10 lines and he was still front and center of some of the posters of Now you see me 2 that I've seen. He was more of a cameo really, this sort of false advertising made me leave the theater quite disappointed after all. I understand that the language barrier would likely result in him not be able to deliver well in terms of acting and dialogue but in that case studios shouldn't throw him on every poster selling him as some sort of major character.",Now You See Me 2

It expands the whole universe and the magic too.The story unfolds when the payback comes from the other side.

This movie just piles impossible and dull acts of ''magic'' on top of each other resulting into no suspense, since you know for a fact the ''Horsemen'' will escape 100% of the time and nothing bad is going to happen to them, because either them or their higher ups have plotted everything out perfectly.I was not a fan of the first movie as it had the same vibe, but this was way worse, i sincerely do not understand why do they have to implement all these crazy plot twists that are not even clever. It appears as if the creators of this just think it is cool to change the way the movie is heading every 5 minutes to give us cheap shock value and wow the audience. It does quite to opposite sadly, since most of the viewers will easily get annoyed with seeing the same stupid cheap tricks and their impossible escapes over and over again. This movie proves that even though you have an incredible cast of actors at your disposal, they can not save you, when the plot is this blatantly dumb.This movie might be very interesting for kids or young teenagers, since it packs the action and cool visual tricks, that kids would definitely enjoy, not the greatest flick for mature audiences though. I hope this is the last past of this franchise, unless they change something drastically. 4/10 for some good acting and decent visuals.",Now You See Me 2

That said, it does delve deeper into the personalities and relationships of the horsemen, particularly Dylan and Danny (Mark Ruffalo and Jesse Eisenberg respectively).The addition I did not appreciate (though understood) was Lulu. My goodness, this girl was annoying. Half of her lines are sexual innuendo that grated on my nerves.Aside from her, the actual movie was fun and reminiscent of the first movies.

It's a shame when a rather intriguing original (with most main stars returning) goes so far off track with it's sequel. Sure the ""slight of hand"" antics are still present, but having so much explanation associated with most tricks is downright time consuming and boring. While Lizzy Caplan (""Master of Sex"" - TV) steps in as the fourth Horsemen, her contributions are left to be the bubbling fourth wheel performing amateur magic diversions, ""never stop smiling"" Dave Franco's (original NYSM) trickery (stand behind the cards and toss playing cards) is boring at best, and Woody Harrelson's ""two-part"" performance is beyond positive explanation. Daniel Radcliffe steps in as the spoiled rich kid felon, yet somehow his character just doesn't matter, and could it be that I'm just tried of watching/hearing Jesse Eisenberg's always the same delivery?

108,abouhelier-r,You Dind't See That One Coming?,6,1 August 2016,"The Four Horsemen resurface and are forcibly recruited by a tech genius to pull off their most impossible heist yet. This film is the sequel to Now You See Me, we have the Four Horsemen back except one of them: Isla Fisher, who's been replaced by Lizzy Caplan. The pleasure of NYSM2 is that the Horsemen perform magic with human powers. They are superheroes of the mind. Three years ago NYSM was a grand illusion thriller, drawing on elements from Nolan's The Prestige and Soderbergh's Ocean series. Mark Ruffalo is the core character of this film, his sincerity makes it work. In my opinion he carries the entire film. He has a heartfelt story in the film and his character has been given the most logical reasons to be there and exist. All of the other characters seem to be contractually obliged to be there. Whereas Ruffalo has motivation. As far as characters go, the rest don't really have much going on. Bigger isn't always better, in the case of sequel, especially in a movie about magicians and out-tricking people. Less is better. The key is accuracy. Though, the director keeps things moving at a smooth pace. The first movie had me questioned some of the things that happened, but for the most part you go gracefully along and have fun! In some ways this sequel is quite the same but it lacks of substance. There's tons of flashy big sequences but none of them really had up to anything. Furthermore, there were an absurd amount of continuity errors in this film. usually I don't look for that sort of things, and filmmakers don't expect their audience to. However, when you examines film and you really look for errors like that, it starts to become noticeable. Finally, this movie is edited with impressive rapid-fire precision.

109,SpoilerAlertReviews,Bad Harry Potter.. Bad.. Go sit in the corner...,6,7 July 2016,"Jon M. Chu takes the helm from Louis Leterrier (Transporter 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk) and actually does a fine job of keeping the same style and magic of the first, better known for dance movies and music films like Step Up 2, LXD and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. There's a sleight change of casting but the core is still very much there with the addition of Lizzy Caplan as cheeky, confident and a little crazy Lula, which is a good one with a very quick brush off for Isla Fisher and absolute no mention of Mélanie Laurent this time round. She was my favourite character from the first Cloverfield, so I'm glad to see her again. Jesse Eisenberg and Dave Franco slip straight into their routine but we get a double helping of Woody Harrelson who pretty much, ridicules himself throughout the movie. Harry Potter goes rogue and does some bad wizardry proving Daniel Radcliffe actually makes a decent bad guy. It's Michael Caine who seems to be the weak link for this film, I wasn't sure if he wanted to be there. Freeman, like Ruffalo is here, there and everywhere. They all shuffle well together with the same funny, clever banter but some parts of the story and script are flawed. Brian Tyler reprises his score which was so suiting for both films, being the type of music you would hear at a magic show. It's recognisable, majestic and illuminating. Nothing really is what it seems, and you might spend most of the film guessing what's going to happen next. Everything all becomes very elaborate, so much so you actually forget what the whole point of the film is, who's who and where's it going and though mostly unpredictable and entertainingly so, the end might be anticlimactic for some. There's a lot of needless dramatic action, and yes, it's all about the showmanship but it needs to be good showmanship at that and some of the action feels cheap and maybe too much, even for the horsemen. It's slick in places and nicely put together but it then starts to lose the magic and mystery towards the end even with some clever, massive reveals it just doesn't hit home. Reminded me of Sneakers at one stage. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it like the first one, so fans should like it but I can see some people picking it to pieces. Now I've Seen It 2. Tada.

The returning cast with the exception of Isla Fisher and the inclusion of Lizzy Caplan makes the new four horsemen. NOW YOU SEE ME 2 picks up a year following the exit of the horsemen. They resurface in a performance to clear their names by exposing the tech goliath Octa. Octa seems to be the least of the problems as the FBI closes in.Jessie Eisenbergs' eccentricity, Dave Francos' prattle, Woody Harrelsons' comic- relief, Mark Ruffalos poise and Lizzy Caplans charm are all on point. Director Jon M. Chu recognizes that the screenplay is weak (just as in ""1""), the characters have no depth and the audience yearning for gimmicks. He delivers. Just like any Bond movie, MI movie, or Fast & Furious movie, its about being flashier than its predecessors. In that category I think ""2"" isn't all that bad.Danielle Radcliffe to me always will be Harry Potter (his fame came at a price). He certainly has the range as an actor but the 24-year-old to millions will always be the wizard. Radcliffes' character of Walter Mabry is surprisingly the most versatile. Given more screen time I would chose Radcliffe over Eisenbergs as the most interesting performance. Freeman and Caine need to not even speak, their presence on its own add value.Did we really need ""2""? Well its too late for that question now since ""3"" is already rumored. Arguably a parody of the first script? To an extent yes, I prefer to consider it a continuation. Exhilarating? Entertaining? Engaging? Yes. Yes. Yes. Do you need to have watched the first movie? Yes. One of the most thrilling pictures this summer? Absolutely. A must watch? Why not.TITLE: NOW YOU SEE ME 2 DIRECTED BY: JON M.

113,iguth,Now You Don't,6,28 April 2019,The sequel of a mediocre magic movie but this time with a different female actress and a much more interesting villain played by Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe allows the series to go from a group vs. the government to them actually having a villain to antagonize them. It attempts to develop the overall plot following the order of magic people set up in the first one but sacrifices some of the characters charm to do so. The development of Mark Ruffalo's character is good but makes little sense that it is only now being introduced rather than already being established earlier. In general it seems to be a kind of duplicate to the first but very slightly worse.,Now You See Me 2

115,iantrader,Don't let the nay-sayers put you off,7,2 October 2016,"I love movies about magic, hustlers and cons so I was a sucker for Now You See Me (1) and the follow-up, Now You See Me 2. They wrap up all these factors together into an irresistible pot.Now You see Me 2 doesn't disappoint, certainly not on a cursory viewing. But if, alas, like me, you like to try to work out how the tricks are done, and how the cons are set up and played, you may still have a few questions at the end which don't seem to be fully resolved. Of course, I may have blinked but surely 95% of your attention over a two-hour period ought to be enough to keep up with the plot.There's always the worry that a sequel will not be as good as the first. The problem with 2 is that it tries to be too tricksy. The cons and switches are multifarious and for the viewer trying to pull everything together into a coherent whole, it's not easy, at least not on a first viewing. I tend to think the writers are trying just a bit too hard.Having said that, the movie is a switchback ride with excellent performances and superb direction from John M Chu. Some of the set pieces are just a touch laboured but nonetheless fun and inventive for that.Several reviews mark it down but, reading between the lines, its seems that this is simply not their type of movie. Fair enough and no objection there. But if you like cons and capers, it's difficult to think you won't love this.The switches and twists will keep you guessing. If you saw the first, this is a must-see, too. And if you didn't see the first - go watch it and then see this.",Now You See Me 2

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first one a lot! Really! But not being able to remember what's up with the FBI guy and that the other magician was supposed to be dead, was a pleasure kill in the beginning of the movie. Other than that, it was nicely made. The tricks were really cool, once more, although a bit far-fetched at times (but that's why you watch movies like that in the first place). Brilliant cast, and nicely acted by all performers involved! I think it was the second time after the batman movie that Caine and Freeman were in the same movie, which is a guarantee on its own! I enjoyed watching it, even if it seemed to drag out a bit longer than it should. Really looking forward to seeing a third movie. I think that this one was not as good as the first one, but it's nice when there's room for improvement! It seems like it was an intermediate step just to get to the third one. I guess that we'll have to wait and see. Nonetheless, I really liked the funny parts in some phases of the movie. Really worth your time!",Now You See Me 2
117,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,7,7 June 2016,"It's just like the first movie...it takes you into the mind of magic tricks and just how easy, hard and confusing and well timed it can be. It's interesting to see just how they do it, because we keep forgetting it's all fake and not real. This movie is magic mixed with a robbery heist all combined into one.All the actors return, excluding Isla Fisher. This time we have a lady by the name of Lula (Played by Lizzy Caplan) who, to an extent replaces Isla Fisher. She's actually really funny and charming, to say the least. All the characters are exactly as the same as they were in the first one. We have a new villain by the name of Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe.) He wants the Horsemen to capture a certain device so he can have access to everyone's details. Daniel Radcliffe surprisingly makes a good villain.We rate this 3/5 stars (7/10.) The movie is entertaining, action packed and nonstop guessing and thrills all the way through. Why didn't we rate it higher? We thought it didn't deserve any higher. It's an enjoyable flick, just like the first one. Nothing more, nothing less. Go and check it out. It's worth seeing. -Autistic Reviewers.",Now You See Me 2
118,danielharden,Oh Oh No It's Magic,4,10 July 2016,"The Four Horseman are sorta all back (bar one) and with even more elaborate tricks up their sleeve than ever in Now You See Me 2. The original director Louis Leterrier has vanished and instead a new director is pulled out of a hat. This sequel comes from the director of Step up 2 and 3D, G.I. Joe: Retaliation and Jem and the Holograms. Now You See Me 2 fails to capture any of the magic the first film may or may not have had and chooses style over substance.The Original cast is back, except for Isla Fisher whose away due to pregnancy and whose character's absence is poorly explained in this film. Instead we have Lizzy Caplan in the female role and she does a decent job in this film along with the other big newbie to the series, Daniel Radcliffe. In my opinion both Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan give the best performances in this film. The rest of the cast are fine except for Woody Harrelson as Chase Mckinney which was just bad and I just wanted it to stop.What this film is all about is the cool and elaborate cons and tricks that are pulled off. As a spectacle it worked great but if you switch your brain on and think about it logically then its not so fun. Although the complication will make audiences ""ooh"" and ""aah"" it leaves the thinking man wondering ""Is that the best plan they could come up like was anything they did necessary??""Speaking of complicated, the film as a whole gets lost in its own complexity. There are many questions left at the end of the film both by the films protagonist (as stated in their dialogue) and the audience. It's OK to leave some questions open to make the ending ambiguous, but this film steers close to the ambiguity seen in the TV show Lost. Some of my questions are: What is the Eye? How was Dylan able to take Thaddeus out of prison if his face was on the news? What was Thaddeus' beef with Dylan because prison life for Thaddeus looked pretty cosy? When did Thaddeus suddenly turn good and tell Dylan about his father at the end? The list goes on.Overall, Now You See Me 2 is a question mark of a film. The new members to the cast are good but the film just thinks complicated means better. If there is one thing that 2016 has taught film makers, its to probably leave films alone that include a group named the Four Horseman (Xmen Apoclpse reference)",Now You See Me 2

This sequel is just plain bad. It takes everything enjoyable about the first one, and removes them.

Even it is quite entertaining, it won't surprise me enough. There are too less magic and too much trying. Movie is too long and there are not simply enough magic in it. If you do magic tricks in front of live audience, this might be enough, but not in a movie. You simply expect something bigger. Now You See Me 2 i quite entertaining, but on the other hand it is quite empty. David Copperfield as an producer you would expect more. I have seen his magic show in live at Las Vegas and that was way better than this movie. It is not a bad movie, but somehow you just expect more.

The first movie left me feel happily fooled with the illusion and apt usage of graphics. But this one dwelled into some revenge type story with a huge build-up for the big show by the Horse man once again but ends without anything in the end. What a disappointment I felt like being scammed for a minute.Over all a below average movie with the feel of only teaser magic's and gimmicks throughout. Appearances are always deceptive.

123,stonedraim,"""Buff. Firm. Taut. Nubile.""",8,27 August 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Man, it feels so good watching a movie with great cast of actors and also a great director. David Copperfield made illusions... sorry, make illusions. He is also the co-producer of this film. The only illusion in ""Now you see me 2"" is that it is a movie. Such a fresh breath to sink into a solid production, speaking of soundtrack, sound effects, acting and so on. The frame they have made around the entire production is nice; everything is associated and related to the observation of the eye and illusions, very good! The fast paced little details happening all around is truly magic (... and there is that pun again...). Almost so over the top that it becomes a little forced... almost. It is delightful to see. Woody Harrelson is a perfect fit for his character; a man of hypnotics that is socially extremely clever.David Copperfield made the statue of liberty disappear and walked through the great wall of China. You take ""The Magic of David Copperfield"". Then you add a little of the ""Mission : Impossible"" movie franchise and a little of the Ocean 13, 12 and 11. Swirl it around, and out comes ""Now you see me 2"". So, if you like ""magic"" and sophisticated types of movies as mentioned above, turn this on. Otherwise, maybe turn this on anyway, as there can be some entertainment and laughs for everyone.About 59:00. That is the time where I loud and clear heard myself saying; ""You gotta be kidding me!?"" One of the most innovative and clever scenes I have seen. Full blown team-work, magic, prestidigitation and dexterity! Can this things be done i reality? Maybe, and it should have been taken years of practise. So perfectly matched together it almost creates the question if this is surreal or can be done in reality. I was completely surprised and impressed when that came in hand (pun intended through the movie; Yeah, that is correct. I just made up a new type of pun... or is that only an illusion!?)! (Did I just raise your curiosity?) The surrounding big band kind of a jazzy tune make that scene scream ""Mission : Impossible"". The line of the movie: Michael Caine : Hell would seem as a day at the spa when we're through with these Horsemen, wouldn't you say? Daniel Radcliffe : You had me at hell.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Better than an average American production. The soundtrack does the trick (pun!?) and creates some really fine moments in here. It's almost like Harry Potter should have waved his magical broom around. There is a great sense of sophisticated class that goes through the entire production. Highly appreciated! - The actors : Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo... and John M. Chu as the director. A class act! Greatly done! - Entertainment : Very entertaining. Watching Mr. Harrelson doing two parts is hilarious, and he nails both characters. Besides that, high in motion to deliver illusions and tricks everywhere. So high in fooling the mind that even John Cena would finally proclaim ""Now you see me"". Also, knowing that my favourite magician David Copperfield co-produced this one, makes it even bigger and better. - Age : 117,6 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 8 Excellent movie and a solid production 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",Now You See Me 2

The bold, brassy, in your face gal, Lula played by Lizzy Caplan, her replacement, not only did nothing for the film but she kept the whole feeling of the 'team' from forming. They never came together as a group with her in there. The addition of Daniel Radcliffe was a brilliant stroke. He was excellent, as was the rest of the cast. Another wonderful character added was Bu Bu played by Tsai Chin, as the little oriental shop owner. And please, could they not find a razor to fit Mark Ruffalo's face? I love him, but he looked so tired and scruffy – mainly because of that face full of whiskers, that I was put off. In other words, this film had all the makings of another great picture like the first Now You See Me, but because of a few flaws, mostly Lizzy Caplan, it just never got there. What a shame.

127,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 73,7,21 June 2016,"So it turns out, the things critics complained about in 2013's Now You See Me would've been better off untouched. While not producing a perfect movie in the first installment, the opposite ends up happening here.On the other hand, much like the first one, Now You See Me 2 has the mind-bending entertainment taken care of. It holds the same charm that was present in its predecessor-- perhaps even more. However, there are just a few things that are problematic.For one, the audience constantly feels like they're missing something--like they're always behind in what's going on. And not because of natural occurrences in the narrative, but because the filmmakers simply want us to be. Which is odd, seeing that this time we're actually in on most of the tricks. In Now You See Me, we're given the story through the FBI agent's point of view--always on the other side of the magic. In the sequel, we're mostly given the point of view of the four magicians, so we're deeply involved behind the scenes. The former situation was a major complaint of the first film, but now that I'm seeing the alternative, I think I would rather things be back to normal. And even though it's worth it in the end, the whole time prior you just sit there, frustrated, not wanting to be in on the trick, trying to mentally disassemble all the rigmarole in the meantime.Two years following the events of the first film, the Four Horsemen (played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Lizzy Caplan) must remain in hiding for fear of the FBI. But they're growing impatient waiting for further instructions. Caplan replaces Isla Fisher as the female in the group. She's very unfunny--even when she so desperately tries to be--making us wish Fisher was back. The clan ends up in China where they are forced into working for a rich businessman (Daniel Radcliffe) who faked his own death and is supposed to be dead to the rest of the world. Radcliffe's brilliantly evil persona is far from the paladin, Harry Potter, as this may be his most mainstream role since.Morgan Freeman also returns with his character still in prison, because, for some reason, he can't seem to prove his innocence yet. Freeman is a key cog because he's what connects Ruffalo's character to his father's death as a child. Also differing from the first film, the first two acts are the weakest part. Waiting for things to get better towards the end, we sit through a magic trick-less setup that's more confusing than interesting. We do, however, get ""treated"" to an unnecessary card-flinging scene that just ends up being silly and five minutes too long.Does a good ending make up for a meandering 90 minutes? I guess it might if those 90 minutes are pertinent to the climax. And in this case, they are. But things may be a little too intricate to be cherished in the long run (something untrue for the first film). Maybe it deserves another watch. Maybe then will things be more clear. Because even after it's all explained to us, things wind up being overly complicated, but I guess you just have to trust that it all makes sense. If you're okay living like that.Twizard Rating: 73",Now You See Me 2
128,Equalizer16,Enjoyable Rubbish,6,17 July 2016,"Now here is a film which had a good idea and would be an entertaining treat for audiences. This of course is 2013's Now You See Me. This concept was used to all it could be in the first film, and what has now followed is just sequelism.Now You See Me 2 is the sequel to a Now You See Me following the acts of the Four Horsemen; a group of magicians following a secret order to bring justice to society and take down corrupt figures. This time the Horsemen are challenged by opposing forces and enemies attempting to destroy them.With only two actors missing from the first film, all major characters return to do almost the exact same thing as they did last time. Along with two new main characters: Lizzy Caplan, and Daniel Radcliffe (who actually are quite good characters) Now You See Me 2 launches this franchise to a new expanded universe full of much more nonsense and more very unbelievable magic tricks than in the first film.So the definition of 'enjoyable rubbish' means a fun time at the cinema but the film is not necessarily good, but you can still just enjoy what it is, even if it is absolutely rubbish.I personally really enjoy the first film, as its really fun and not annoying. However the film does try to act like a clever film but it isn't, as like in the first film, it tries to justify its wit and cleverness with berserk twists and turns which try to be sophisticated but just aren't.I will also say that the film is very close to being defined as a science fiction film, as there are so many unbelievable tricks, sequences, and extremely advanced technology you have to call it fantasy.However, the film does have its pros. One key thing is character development which is excelled much more in this film with more depth and darkness. Not all characters are developed very well, but still reveals more about these Horsemen. Like the first one it is visually entertaining to watch, along with some pretty cool (very unbelievable) sequences.Overall the film is enjoyable but just tries to act clever but isn't, is quite complicated for the film that it is, very crowded in narrative, and just pure nonsense.

But, having watched the first film, you already know the formula and they stick to it quite well: things start of bad, get worse, brief rally, go badly again, but ultimately the good guys succeed. Yet, compared to the first film, the characters chemistry doesn't seem to flow as well - Lizzy Caplan seems like a teenager compared to Isla Fisher, and two Woody Harrelsons are not as good as one - resulted in my not caring so much about them working as a team. Part of the surprise of the first film was the twist at the end. This time, it didn't feel so surprising. The set pieces are well shot, with all the showmanship elements that the Horse Man seem to require to attract their audience. And while it seemed things were wrapped up at the end of the first film, at times it felt like they've used this sequel to flesh out the original, rather than add a new chapter to the Horse Man, with an expectation that there will be a big reveal in the third film.One annoyance, as a Londoner, is how obvious they make it that much of the action takes place in Greenwich, London, while acting like it's not. The opening scene says tunnel to Manhatten, but it's really a tunnel under the Thames, fine. I get all films use locations and make them up how they wish, but if you're going to use obvious landmarks - like the Cutty Sark or Greenwich Market (as opposed to the aerial shots of Covent Garden they use) - having a character ask ""where's your entry? South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich..."", while they're obviously stood in the world famous Greenwich University, seems like a redundant line to me. Likewise the bad guys using a map on the other side of the river? Given what their main target is, this just seems sloppy.If you liked the first film, then you'll see this one to progress the story line.

Picture Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine sharing a meaningful conversation in a shrouded, dark environment. It should have been one of the best scenes in the movie!, two Hollywood heavyweights given an opportunity to verbally spar and display their chops. The reality? A forgettable scene, in a half assed movie where two old guys exchange money for the completion of a dubious task... Kinda sounds like their role/performance in this movie eh!?! A simple payday, for simple work. Unfortunately the audience pays the real price, shattering any expectation of a good movie alarmingly early - this movie stumbles from scene to scene, ending in a clattering/jagged mess of production.Eisenberg turns in yet another forgettable/carbon copy performance to his last 5+ movies. Woody is competent as always, but far from well utilized. Really the only stand out performance is Caplin's, and while she clearly does good work - her character has absolutely no credibility with her eggshell background, and unlikely membership into the group.There's little merit in continuing to point out this sequels failings - This is a bad movie that should not have been made - 3/10",Now You See Me 2

137,jayeshdave78,Fantastic Plot,10,18 June 2016,"One of the best movies I've seen this year-simply for the writing and plots in the movie. Obviously we have had more visually appealing movies and superhero movies, but this ones unique. Its a fantastic spin and continuation from the first part and couldn't have been better. Great acting by the horsemen but not sure why the girl was substituted--actually the girl lost out and not the movie. All characters were fantastic and so was the setting starting with Macau. I don't think anyone could have predicted the outstanding twist at the end -- I for one, thought they would show Lionel Shrike alive and well which could have been an alternately intriguing end. I've heard critics claim there could have been more emphasis on magic than plots and I don't disagree with them had the directors thought of lengthening the film, but am satisfied completely. If it were up to me, I would've had every human being see this film once and decide for themselves.",Now You See Me 2
138,Jim-Eadon,"A failure, but have a generous 5/10",4,9 April 2017,"The first movie, basically a supernatural fantasy, had a mix of charm, charisma and glamour. This movie, by comparison, only shared the supernatural factor. The good. I liked Harry Potter's cameo and was rather cheering him on. He was right, we all need to get off the damned grid and get our privacy and therefore freedom back. I felt sorry for him when he got busted. The bad: the entire cast were poor apart from Harry Potter and the English gent with the moustache. Woody Harrelson played twins in this movie, neither of them likable. I assumed that the twin would be behind a neat twin swap trick, or what's the point? Maybe they erased that twist from the script. The twin character was grating, just awful. The other two horsemen guys didn't hold my attention. The new girl tried hard but had a thankless task as she lacked the looks, style and class of the first girl. The original Horsemen were not dismissive of her for nothing: she had no stage presence, no showbiz dazzle. Indeed she seemed to be a kooky escapee from a rom-com (and suddenly, at the end, she had indeed hooked up with one of the Horsemen or whoever.)Her character ended up doing some lame (yet impossible!) pigeon tricks as her contribution to the climax. Yet early in the movie she performed an extraordinary talented magic decapitation trick that, upon a quick rewind, turned out to be literally impossible. And moments later she vanished, which, again, was impossible unless the door was nearby and wide open, which we could rule out by the puzzled look of the (non-gullible) magician's mug. And cartoon-logic impossible feats (blatantly CGI) are par for the course for the entire movie. But even that would be forgivable if it were not for the boring bits with belaboured exposition by Freeman Morgan (contrast that with the effortlessly fun exposition by Harry Potter). Why is Morgan in this movie and, indeed, in half of all Hollywood movies? It's like Hollywood accountants think he gives a movie a marketroid stamp of token street cred or some such, probably because 95% of reviewers feel compelled to say how ""talented"" he is (virtue signalling praise of a non-white actor?) As in, ""Freeman's really talented, but he sucked in this movie, but it wasn't his fault, it was the writer's fault"". The writers screwed up, but so did the director, this movie lacked soul beyond the script's bloated defects. The dreadful twin should have been cut out. The actors seemed detached, they didn't seem to have any heart. The ""girl Horsmen"" gamely tried to liven things up a bit, but the movie was generally dark and slightly depressing.",Now You See Me 2
139,jay-techie2007,Can be given a pass.... poorly executed.,5,20 July 2016,"The first half an hour of the movie confirmed it's going to tank big time. NYSM2 basically rides on the same formula that the first part registered its success on, completely ignoring that with a sequel, the audience expects something new. Story (4/10): The story is on a similar plot as the first one - four Horseman trying to expose a corrupt businessman and use their magic as the weapon. One of the Horseman, Henley (Isla Fisher), is replaced with Lula (Lizzy Caplan). While the story has new characters (some of them completely unnecessary like McKinney's twin brother), new location, and a slightly different setup, it doesn't come up with anything which we didn't see in the first part. It is kind of a drag after some time. The new and unnecessary characters are evidently conceptualized poorly. The only interesting part of the entire story was perhaps the sub-plot of Rhodes-Bradley animosity where the writer spent some good time to develop an interesting twist to it.Acting (6/10): The movie doesn't boast of much amazing acting. In spite of big names like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Mark Ruffalo, the other lead protagonists are way off. Daniel Radcliffe does a decent enough job of a tech prodigy but there was only as much screen time he had. Direction (4/10): It is the direction that sank the movie. When you have a very predictable story, all you need is brilliant execution. A dragged illogical sequence of chip stealing from the facility was a kind of final nail in the coffin. Except for some thrilling magic tricks, the movie was executed poorly. The things which worked for the first part were the very things that tanked this one. Overall (5/10): Overall, the movie can be given a pass. You won't be missing anything if you haven't watched this one.",Now You See Me 2

Good magic tricks, good dialogues and we were kept in the dark for most of the time not knowing who was behind everything. This was disappointing and tedious, as we knew who was doing what to whom, too much talking and many of the dialogues lasted too long, not enough magic and nothing was funny. The fighting/stunt scenes could have (should have) used the Jackie Chan choreographers as the fights/stunts were a blur.Were there too many players in here? When you have a gaggle of actors all vying for screen time much is lost on the audience to a point we don't care about any of them. Hence we didn't care. The scenes seemed rushed as were the dialogues. They were trying to fit a round peg into a square hole and we all know that only works in dreams. We all know Morgan Freeman is a great actor, but he needs to cut down on his commercials because there were times in here I expected him to sell us something. Having Woody Harrelson also play the role of his twin was okay, but it did prevent another actor from getting a job. What was the point? Huh? The FBI was also after the Four Horsemen for robbing a bank in another country from the last movie. They were a a non-factor and why they were even in here was a mystery onto itself. These scenes just helped drag the movie longer. To be fair the movie did better at the 3/4 mark when the Four Horsemen went to London and were thrown out of a plane. (Whaaaat?) Still after that there were too many explanations that we could barely hear and understand and again, we just did not care. Let's hope there will be no Now You See Me 3. (3/10) Violence: Yes.

142,OlieRendch,Not as good as the first but an adequate sequel.,7,7 July 2016,"Despite the majority opinion I really enjoy 2013's Now You See Me; sure some of it doesn't make sense but for some reason I find it very entertaining. This year's sequel sees us eighteen months since the events of the first film and the Four Horsemen are tasked with performing a heist for Daniel Radcliffe.First off, you have to acknowledge the all-star cast here; I really enjoyed them in the first one so it was great to see the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Morgan Freeman and more back on board. They all do an excellent job of course and get straight back into these characters who's lives I was fully invested in. After the twist at the end of the original I was wondering how Ruffalo's character would change but I really enjoyed the majority of his arc in this and it builds on what we knew of his back-story already which was cool. We did have some new characters introduced to us and they were just OK; Isla Fisher did not return as the female Horseman so they bring in Lizzy Caplan as this new magician and despite a bit of a rushed introduction she was surprisingly tolerable; her character may be a little irritating to some as she is used as the comic relief a lot which was unnecessary and I do think Fisher's character was more interesting but as far as replacements go, she wasn't bad. Daniel Radcliffe also joins this cast as our antagonistic billionaire who wants something only the Horseman can get; so yeah it's a plot-point we've seen a lot of times in film but hey, it is a heist movie so I'll let it slide. He was absolutely fine in his character, not quite as threatening as sometimes I think he was meant to be but once you get used to this what this type of movie is, he's more than adequate.Just touching on the plot; it's a basic heist movie with the Now You See Me glitter all over it so plenty of illusions and visually interesting effects. I enjoyed it quite a lot, plenty of action, plenty of tricks, the locations were interesting as well, quite international which I enjoyed. There were a few twists here and there but some you could see coming and others I wasn't particularly keen on. I know they tried to top the big reveal of the last movie but it didn't really work here; it seemed to struggle explaining what it was they were surprising us with. But as a whole the main story worked for me.Something, or rather someone, I did not enjoy much was a particular character they introduced as a relative to one of the horseman; his purpose was a little unnecessary and what they made him into just brought the quality of this movie down. He was more suited for some sort of comedy which unfortunately this film tried to much of. The first film had funny moments and Harrelson was our comic relief but now they've introduced two more ""funny"" characters and it cheapened it at times.My last critique is that unless you enjoy the first film and have watched it recently I don't think you'll enjoy Now You See Me 2 as much. It requires you to remember a lot which was OK for me as I have seen the original a few times but for a casual viewer you are left asking a few questions. So in the end, if you didn't like the first one, you won't like this. For me it wasn't quite as neat and shiny as the Now You See Me but entertaining enough.",Now You See Me 2

No other to contest because its a monopoly. But i cant stand with a bad character development and cheap writing. This kind of movie is a character driven typical, you need to amend the four horsemen better as the duration goes on to make this movie work. This movie too busy to close one mystery with another one until the director forget how cumbersome this movie is. Shorten the context of the story and sharpen the character depth will erupt the movie in my opinion.Its not like a magic story nor the cast that plunge the rating.

144,parleon-thedon,Now You See Me 2 - Review: Cash Grab,1,10 June 2016,"I liked the first movie, I could say that I kinda loved it.When the first movie was released, I passed on the theater experience. At one point, I was never going to watch the first movie, but that all changed when a friend of mine had recommended it to me.So one day, I actually sat down and watched Now You See Me after hearing a lot of mixed reviews about it. I had a lot of fun with the first movie, I thought it was creative, it was beautifully shot, the music was great, all the actors were charismatic, and the movie moved at a fast paced.Now You See Me 2 is just more of the same, but this movies execution is much slower. Also, the circumstances in this movie are quite unbelievable. The first movie had some ridiculous, almost ludicrous, and quite unbelievable feats involved, but the second movie takes it to a whole other level.The opening in Now You See Me 2 is a bit slow, it takes a while to get things going; However, once everybody's in place, the movie does start to pick up steam. The first job that the Horsemen execute in the movie is entertaining and fun, but then after that, the movie slows down again, and by the mid point I fell asleep. I woke up after the Horsemen had executed their second job, so I missed it, but the story wasn't hard to follow. I did fall asleep during quite a few sequences because the movie was so boring, slow, and predictable, however, even though I missed some things, I was never lost or confused when I woke up.The fight sequences in this movie are bad, they're poorly shot, and I could barely tell what was happening. The establishing shots were good, the music also added some form of excitement to them.The actors were still pretty likable, even Daniel Radcliffe was good, but I thought he was completely underutilized, and he barely did anything.The ""magic tricks"" in this movie are completely illogical, the first movie had this problem as well, but the sequel turns every magician into a superhero, it tries to make logical sense, but I feel that the screenwriters just wanted to show the audience something cool, and so they just said, ""To hell with logic!""Overall, Now You See Me 2 is not as fun as the first movie in my opinion. This movie has one or two fun moments, but as a whole it's a complete snooze fest. This movie is 100% predictable (even if you fall asleep), it's boring, it's slow, and it's just a lazy cash grab. I dare say that I love the first movie, but the sequel sucks.Final Grade: F",Now You See Me 2
145,BillSims28,"Five Word Review: Convoluted, Messy Sequelitis; Frequently Fun",5,20 July 2016,"Unfortunately not titled 'Now You Don't', this sequel to the frothy, enjoyable 2013 sleeper hit adds to its all-star ensemble cast (Lizzy Caplan replaces Isla Fisher and Daniel Radcliffe is introduced as a villain), expands the setting, and ups the stakes, like most sequels. And, like most sequels, it's not as good as the first one. With The Horsemen being threatened by the threat of Daniel Radcliffe (odd to see him in a film about magic eh?) there are more hi-jinks, impossible feats of magic, convoluted twists, and witty repartees between the talented cast. The cast is undoubtedly the strongest thing about this film - the standout scenes are the ones in which The Horsemen are in their element, doing quick flashy magic and impressing everyone. Unfortunately there aren't as many of these scenes as there should be, with the filmmakers seemingly intent on switching from one underdeveloped subplot to another. Mark Ruffalo, as the Head Horseman, spends much of his tins with Morgan Freeman, with the two struggling to sell unconvincing drama. In a bizarre and distracting turn of events, Woody Harrelson takes on a dual role, introducing his character's twin brother as a campy villainous antagonist with almost nothing to add to the story which already has enough characters - it's always good to see more Harrelson but the twin aspect was unnecessary. There's a father-son relationship between Radcliffe and Michael Caine - who is great for his ten minutes of screen time - an FBI investigation team with a young officer who looks up to Ruffalo, a helpful pair of Chinese magicians with some vague link to The Horsemen....it is at times almost as overstuffed as Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's a classic case of sequelitis, and one which dooms the film almost from the get-go. Which is not to say there's not fun to be had: the delectable sleekness of some scenes is sure to bring a smile to the face and with this cast it's impossible not to be entertained. Standouts are Radcliffe's demented bearded tech whizz who is just fantastic to watch. He is an actor who has really thrown off the shackles of the Harry Potter legacy and is now just a great actor to have in anything, now showing his skill as a villain. Lizzy Caplan is bubbly and fun in her role, whilst Jesse Eisenberg, Harrelson, and Dave Franco are all solid as a team - if the widely purported third instalment of this franchise is to go ahead, then a good suggestion would be to bring down the stakes and focus more on the team dynamic. Ultimately, the film is flashy and at times fun, but drags more than its predecessor, is overstuffed, and is simply less enjoyable. One of the main criticisms of the first film was the empty flash, but the sequel has just expanded on that. A decent enough watch, but not something that will be remembered or re-watched. 53/100",Now You See Me 2

Yeah, it's fancy camera work, but it makes no sense. After the guards search the first person, pass the damned thing to him/her and be done with it. The scene went on for 15 minutes and then ended with Woody Harrelson almost miss catching the card in his hat of all things. I don't know how they got these actors to sign on for the second installment, honestly. And is it just me or does Jesse Eisenberg play a great prick because he's really a prick and it's not acting?

149,ellimic,Not bad,7,14 January 2018,"In all I thought this film was ok. The magic was good and I particularly liked Mark Ruffalo's fight scene.I liked Woody Harrelson playing his twin brother and liked how they built more on thier skills; also trying to teach thier skills to others in the group.
The bit with the computer chip on the playing card seemed rather pointless as they clearly didn't need to move it around as much as they did; and how they moved it around thier bodies just seemed unrealistic.I thought the bit at the end with the horsemen doing small pre-shows in London and explaining the magic to the crowd was a bit weird; we went from one man debunking magic tricks to four people debunking magic tricks?
And to what purpose, to show the crowd how they caught Radcliffe and Caine at the end, which no one really needed to know anyway.
And Morgan Freemans revelation really made no sense; he was on the fathers side but worked against him then he died so he stayed a bad guy? Overly complicated and un-necessary.But I think what really let this film down was giving away the story line before it had even begun; in the first film it wasn't until the end that Mark Ruffalo linked everything together to Mélanie Laurent on the bridge, but here everything was explained up front and I think that almost killed it.

I can understand why Isla Fisher did not do the sequel as she probably read the script and wisely kept away. Too bad Lizzie Caplan didn't follow suit. This is not a film she wants on her resume. And what the hell is with the stupid idea to have Woody Harrelson play twins?? It appeared as if his twin brother was retarded but I'm sure that is not what the film makers were going for. The poorly developed story is all about flash and effect with no substance. They aimed this directly at those who loved the 1st film and were sure to flock to see what ever crap they put out for a second attempt. I have always had an issue with sequels as the film makers usually don't spend too much on a good script or writer and depend on the success of the first film to put bums in seats. This is most definitely the case here. The director also has very little regard for the audience and must think they are idiots who can't think for themselves as he does ridiculous things and expects us to just let them go.

The Horsemen are not especially well drawn and in this age of hyper normalisation it could have been a great opportunity to highlight issues of ""truth"", and who controls information which was a central part of the plot that they never explored the implications of.

153,ChristianLeFeuvre,Not a bad sequel,6,23 May 2017,"'Now You See Me 2' is very entertaining but you have to see the first film to understand the characters and plot of this one. I personally think fans of the original should like this one as well as you do get a lot of magic scenes from the movie. The film had a perfect run length and it's just as entertaining. The plot for Now You See Me 2 holds together well. The Four Horsemen -- world-famous magicians who use their ""powers"" to expose greedy criminals -- are in hiding, and the fifth ""Horseman"", revealed in the first film, to be FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), calls the team back into action for a gig meant to expose a crooked cell-phone tycoon. Only, the gig turns on the Horsemen, and the team finds itself in the middle of a convoluted vengeance plan with deep connections to the first film. Only three of the original Horsemen remain, the pickpocket Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the surly J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), and the hypnotist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) Woody Harrelson, in this movie, gets to play his original character, Merritt McKinney as well as Merritt's fey, quirky and mysterious twin. I have to say, I am not a fan of Woody Harrelson anyway, and didn't like him in the first movie either. Unfortunately original female member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) has left the team. In this film she's replaced by a new woman, Lula (Lizzy Caplan), who almost immediately points out the tokenism at work: ""I'm the girl Horseman!"", however she seemed to be there for the sake of having a female in the team and the friendship between the original team and her seemed awkward. One antagonist making life difficult for the Four Horsemen this time out is Walter Mabry, a wealthy entrepreneur who exists ""off the grid"" and coerces the Four Horsemen into stealing a fantastic new computer ""stick"" for him. He also has an important connection with a former target of the Horsemen and as a result the money they stole sort of belonged to him, and he'd like reparations. Mabry's is played with a great dose of devilishness by Daniel Radcliffe. Once again, on the heels of everyone is an exasperated team of FBI agents who, in my opinion, barely registered as a threat. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine also reprise their roles as Thaddeus Bradley and Arthur Tressler respectively. This sequel is clever, well-paced and entertaining. I don't think it is as good as the first film however and there is a seriously preposterous scene *spoiler alert* where the Horsemen try to smuggle a valuable computer chip out of a secret facility. Suddenly suspicious, their escort orders the guards to search them. The slender chip is attached to a playing card, which the Horsemen attempt to conceal through sleight-of-hand tricks amongst themselves. As the pat-down continues, the magicians' moves grow more elaborate. After a few minutes, the card is flying around the room in defiance of all known physical laws—from one Horseman's hand, to the bottom of another's shoe, up through another Horseman's sleeve, down a pant leg, under a collar, into a bra, and so on. Now You See Them 2 has plenty of energy and if you loved the first one you'll like this one, although I don't think, as much.",Now You See Me 2
154,yourfavoritecritic,Now You See Me? Now I Wish I Didn't,1,17 July 2021,"Now You See Me 2 picks up a year later from where the previous film left off with the Four Horsemen in hiding, waiting for instructions from the Eye. After their comeback show is sabotaged the Horsemen are hired against their will to perform their most daring heist for a tech genius. Released in 2016 Now You See Me 2 was directed by Jon M. Chu and starred Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Radcliffe. With a change in directors and the loss of Isla Fisher how well does Now You See Me 2 stack up as a sequel?Well, after not being the biggest fan of the first film, Now You See Me 2 found a way to let me down even more than the first. Much of that is due to the story, which is much goofier this time around as it takes our characters halfway across the world for a majority of the runtime as they get wrapped in a plot that I really had no interest in. Despite the silliness of the main plot I enjoyed the film spending more time with the Horsemen themselves (even if the characters aren't all that interesting), as I found in the first, not enough time was spent on the group and would have liked to see have seen more of the characters preparing for their shows and their thoughts on the ongoing F. B. I. Investigation. I also appreciated the film exploring more of Ruffalo's character as it did answer some questions I had in the first, and although his motivations are still flimsy at least there is one and it is shown. For the most part, there isn't a ton of magic being done in the film, it is very heavy on dialogue and action, and although the magic in the first film was very flashy and had moments that didn't feel realistic, here it was cranked to the max with magic that just doesn't feel based in the reality. The grand finale to the film was something that (similar to the first) left me with more questions than answers as to how that was classified as a trick and why the general public would be so interested in it. I did appreciate this film continuing the story and not being a retread from the last, and I did like how the concept was used, as it was initially what I thought of when thinking about magicians involved in a heist. However, I would be remised not to mention that I did sort of miss the scenes where the magicians put on a live show, as I found Now You See Me 2 to be quite dialogue-heavy for this sort of summertime blockbuster film. Many times it felt like the story would stall for 15-20 minutes and I would be lying if I said that I wasn't bored at moments throughout. With a runtime of over two hours, not much happens in the story that couldn't have been told in half that time and it's not like the filmmakers explored the story to the best of their ability, as a film commanding that much time, they had an ample amount of opportunities to go deeper.With spending more with the Horsemen the audience is treated to more of their dynamic and that is mostly fine, the film picks up with three of the four feelings burnt out from having to be in hiding and not getting the chance to perform. New addition Lizzy Caplan, who replaces Isla Fisher, is starry-eyed when joining the group and although no explanation is given as to why she joined the Horsemen outside of them ""needing a woman in the group"", I found her character quite annoying. I usually enjoy Lizzy Caplan in films, however, the character of Lula just comes across like the quirky side character who cracks jokes in serious situations and tries hard to be liked. Over the course of two hours, I found that to be quite tiresome, and with the involvement of Chase McKinney, Woody Harrelson's characters twin brother, who comes off like a wannabe character in The Big Lebowski, almost all of the new characters didn't bring much to the story outside of being irritating and that sadly includes Daniel Radcliffe too.There are not many positives I can say about Now You See Me 2, there are one or two sequences that I thought were fun, like when the group is trying to sneak a computer chip through a metal detector; and even though the film is more bright and cartoony to fit the goofy story, it was still ugly to looks at with no shots that stood out. I at least expected Now You See Me 2 to be halfway decent/more of the same, but with questionable decision making and a story that is just as convoluted as the previous film's finale, there is not much I can say about Now You See Me 2 outside of that I do not recommend it. It's not even dumb fun, the film moves at such a slow pace and wants the audience to care about the ridiculous and confusing story, that it left me bored to tears throughout. That's not to mention the film's smugness when unveiling its plot twist, even though the first entry had that aura too, at least it felt like it was sort of earned. I do not recommend this film, even if you were a fan of the first and for that reason, I am giving Now You See Me 2 a 1.5/10.",Now You See Me 2
155,rebeccalucy,Nothing groundbreaking...,5,27 January 2018,"It can be a fun film if you know what you are getting into, but is lacking in parts. The concept is interesting but sometimes is too far separated from reality. The acting is just okay, nobody gives a fantastic performance.

The cinematography is bland but the final shot is quite unique! One scene - despite being a little silly - is very fun. As they have to pass a card to each other without being noticed, the film gets creative with the way the magicians pass it to each other. The settings are pretty, and can stand out from just a typical city. Overall, a fun action film but nothing groundbreaking.",Now You See Me 2

There's a lot of hand-wavey, look-how-cool-we-are tricks that actually have very little basis in reality. At least in the first film, most of the tricks and effects were fairly believable.Unfortunately, this second movie throws any pretense at believability out the window and just goes for spectacle. And that might not be a bad thing-- if you really grew to care what the spectacle was all about. You don't. The premise to this film is flimsy at best. And the climactic scene toward the end of the movie falls very flat.I did like the resolution for a couple of the characters at the very end of the movie, though.

The problem is they forgot to write her character, or her role in the movie. At times she talks a lot, is hot for Dave Franko and is unnecessary, even superfluous since they ended up being 5 horsemen.Not a good movie really, but as I said, sufficiently entertaining.",Now You See Me 2

Don't get me wrong here, the acting was decent, and I'll let you know where the movie failed for me. So, let's get into it.Synopsis: One year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public's adulation with their Robin Hood-style magic spectacles, The Four Horsemen resurface for a comeback performance in hopes of exposing the unethical practices of a tech magnate. The man behind their vanishing act is none other than Walter Mabry, a tech prodigy who threatens the Horsemen into pulling off their most impossible heist yet. Their only hope is to perform one last unprecedented stunt to clear their names and reveal the mastermind behind it all. Starring: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Lizzie Caplan, Mark Ruffalo, Daniel Radcliffe Director: Jon M. ChuThe Ugly: The worst part about this movie is the same as the first movie. It's the story, plain and simple. How could people not put two and two together in the first movie when it came to Ruffalo's character? The same happens here. Here we find out who the leader of the eye is, and what the motivations are, but it is pointless because it nulls the first movie. Such a major let down on story telling here.The Bad: Yes, the acting was good to me, except for one person. Radcliffe is a good actor, but here he seemed lost in the shuffle. Too much was going on throughout the movie. He just couldn't reveal his acting chops.The Good: It's not the acting that made this movie a decent one for me, it was the illusions. From the stories out there, the actors did most of the tricks themselves. Granted, there were a few parts that relied more on CGI than on actual old school tricks, but it was still a fun ride watching them. The tricks are what made this movie.Final Thoughts: Wait for it to come out on TV or something. Don't go out and buy it or Red Box. There is no wait here.Rating: 6 out of 10That's it for me folks.

So many talented people in this film given absolutely no help in making themselves likable, this movie doesn't even have the clever, engaging 'was that magic or movie making' successes of the first film. It reminds me, actually, of the Ocean's 11 sequels - where everyone involved appears to be having a great time, except the audience, who is ignored or disdained at every turn. A bummer.

165,modernmonstersdotnet,Stick It In Your Eye,3,23 September 2016,"If in the first installment of this derogatory franchise money was magic, in this one magic is a farce. Trying hard to figure out practical explanations for his crew of illusionists' CGI tricks, panting writer Ed Solomon tinkers with various form of comedy, from a Rube Goldberg self- decapitation to slapstick to witty banter, the rest of the writing team being in charge of ""character development"", or rather the illusion thereof.Back are our Five Horsemen, even though the only female character has changed. Details. Please have a round of applause for Mr Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo, playing Mark Ruffalo), Mr Wilder (James Franco, very good at smiling charmingly), Mr McKinney (Woody ""Ham"" Harrelson), Miss Lula, who doesn't have a name since she's a woman (Lizzy Caplan, as perky and quirky as Isla Fisher was, well, neither the one nor the other), and Mr Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg, easily the best of the lot as he manages to infuse some measure of vicious cipher into his performance). And of course our super duper magical team of sociopaths would not come back without their pet peeves: Mr Bradley (Morgan Freeman, in charge of the 'An eye for an eye"" voice-over because he has a soothing voice), Mr Tressler (Sir Michael Caine, cashing his check), and some new flesh: Mr Li, who doesn't have a first name since he's Chinese (Jay Chou, who might have the best line of dialogue translating what grandmother said in Cantonese), and Mr Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe, good at cult lines like ""Tadam!"" or ""Splash!"").What does it say about a movie when the name of nine actors are above the title, among them two Oscar winners and three nominees? One thing: cash machine. In the first movie, the Four Horsemen, under the shady guidance of the fifth, were actually performing some grand illusions which Mr Bradley debunked, in order to rob heartless insurance magnate Mr. Tressler. In this one, they debunk their own tricks in order to perform a heist. If you have kept your childhood fascination for prestidigitation, disappearing bunnies and appearing doves, avoid this film at all cost: it must be the most depressing backstage visit you will ever have.So, what happens this time, are you asking? Mr Mabry has invented the movie's McGuffin, a program which is alluded to sometimes as a chip, sometimes as a card and as a stick the rest of the time. He proudly shows a PowerPoint presentation about it in Macau, where the Horsemen are teleported by way of a swirling pizza box and a debris chute. You don't wanna know. He's a genius, see, and therefore is insufferable and childish, the only way Hollywood knows to write geniuses to pander to the short attention span of its audience. Also, he looks and sounds high.Said stick is the reason why an endlessly protracted scene involving an ace of spades will test your patience, not to mention the disbelief you had to check at the door. It is also responsible for Mr McKinney to have a twin brother, resulting in Woody Harrelson trying to out-ham himself. Those scenes are a pain to watch. It also brings together father and son Mr. Tessler and Mr Mabry and frankly, the very concept of Sir Michael Caine fathering Daniel Radcliffe is terrifying, if a good example of poetic justice. Damn stick.Unable to give any character any motivation that is not rooted in family bonds, unable to stage any violence out of the proverbial ""nobody gets hurts"" box, unable not to picture Asians full of wisdom and – AWESOME! – able to speak English, unable to even film Macau or London, you can't expect NYSM2 to know anything about pattern recognition or magic, even though it tries to bullshit you it does. If by the first hour you have not guessed who will be revealed as head of The Eye in the next movie, you deserve to see it next year. If you do, one guesses you will muse which one is best, pulling a head out of an eye or a hat out of a rabbit.",Now You See Me 2

And on top of that, its not knowing that one character will escape a reinforced steel safe submerged in water, but its wanting to know 'how' that keeps you so engaged in the film.

169,kevin_newdirections,NYSM 2 is more interested in theatrics than logic,6,19 June 2016,"Normally, suspension of disbelief can suffice to maximize one's viewing pleasure in illusionist films, which tend to capitalize on showmanship to camouflage the many plot holes of the story. However, the second act of the 2013 surprise hit, Now You See Me, requires a brain entirely shut off for one to endure the film 'till the end and still enjoy it. While the magical heists in Now You See Me 2 do reach new heights, they are spoiled with twists and turns that fail to make any lick of sense.Picking up a year after last year's heist, the film finds the remaining members of The Four Horsemen–illusionist J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), hypnotist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and street magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco)–laying low and awaiting further instructions from The Eye, the secret society of magicians they've been recruited into. F.B.I. mole/ringleader Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) regroups them along with a new ""horsewoman"", fake- violence specialist Lula May (Lizzy Caplan), to expose a corrupt businessman planning to launch a device that is claimed to be the ""key to every computer system on the planet."" Meanwhile, tech mogul Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) wants the device for himself and bends the will of our rogue tricksters to pull off their toughest stunt yet in exchange for their freedom. Clueless as to his team's whereabouts, Dylan is left with no choice but to ask for the help of Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a scheming magic debunker who he framed in the first film and who also happens to be plotting his revenge against the horsemen in ways they couldn't expect.Director Jon Chu maintains the sleek look and fast pace of the first film, showcasing, this time, more of the heists than the magic. Here, the magicians seem to have graduated from Robin Hoods showering cash to their audiences but to corporate whistleblowers using their illusions for a greater purpose. The plot itself involves more infiltration and theft that can be found in a Mission Impossible film, making the lack of real-life magical spectacle more glaring. Chu and screenwriter Ed Solomon, however, hurts the film's credibility and betrays the profession by using ""magic"" that mostly passes here as ""cheating-using-Hollywood-special-effects-and-wildly- implausible-writing-not-even-David-Blaine-can-accomplish."" That being said, there are two kinds of magic tricks here: tricks they don't try to explain and tricks they agonizingly try to explain and you wish they haven't.The problem with Now You See Mee 2 is the same one that dogged its predecessor: It is more interested in theatrics than logic. Alas, not even a sleight-of-hand can obscure the trouble that brews in its already convoluted plot which for certain will be shoved with more swords in the future installment. ""Look closely because the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see."" Well, if you step back a bit, you're not actually being fooled but you're being scammed.

170,nando1301-1,They killed the franchise,1,8 December 2016,"A great cast wasted on a terrible script and bad directing. Makes super-hero movies seem plausible and profound by comparison. The first film (Now You See Me) was entertaining, creative, intelligent. NYSM2 is nothing of the sort: it is filled with clichés, totally predictable, from the first to the last scene. Yes, this kind of film requires you to suspend your disbelief, but there needs to be some plausibility within a make-believe universe proposed by the story. In this story, things do not make any sense at all. Yes, they are magicians and they can make card tricks... But the whole sequence in which they flip around a card among themselves while they are being searched by twelve different guards, and none of the guards see them throwing that card around the room... That's just ridiculous! They could have filmed that better, they could've come up with something just a little bit smarter...And that is just an example of how much dumber this film is, compared to the first one. I hope this flop discourages producers from making NYSM3, but you never know... Some Hollywood producers seem to enjoy burning money as if they were doing magic tricks.",Now You See Me 2
171,nikhil_kamra,"Sequels, eh?",6,25 September 2016,"I loved the first movie. But I never thought I'd refer to it as ""the first movie"". For me, that movie was it. It was a pretty decent movie and I really enjoyed it. I even re-watched it before watching this one. And that only made me realize how this ""sequel"" was REALLY UNNECESSARY!No, this movie is NOT bad.But it's pointless! We didn't need a sequel. I really hate that people these days are not just milking the franchises anymore; they are making up franchises out of gosh-darn thin air.The material for the first one didn't require a sequel. It was supposed to be a stand-alone movie. A one-time two hour entertainment, unless you count the re-watches.But no, since the director or the producer or the whoever wants more money, they go ahead and make ""more of the same"".I mean for whatever reason, Isla Fisher was not in this movie. The initial ""Horsemen"" rejected doing this movie, or weren't cast by the producers out of their own will. Still, they went ahead and made this movie with Lizzy Caplan instead. Now, don't get me wrong, I really liked Lizzy. I think she was even better than Isla in some ways. But if you don't even have the initial cast for your ""sequel"", you probably should get a clue and NOT GO AHEAD WITH IT. Or at least hold off till you can assemble the initial cast.Nevertheless, the movie is a fair watch. As far as ""sequels"" go, it's not ALL bad, but it's not a good ""definitely a worth watch"" movie either, unlike it's predecessor.6/10Watch it to see a few funny scenes here and there, and a few decent magic tricks (less decent than the ones in the previous one, or some re-hashed ones). And watch it to see the cast (however incomplete) back in action.Otherwise, skip it. There's literally NO NEED to watch it, just like there literally WASN'T ANY need for this to be made.",Now You See Me 2

How will they be able to achieve their goal and get out of the frying pan without jumping into the fire without their mentor around ?
If this does not sound very subtle, it is just because it isn't.We can't really worry about anything or care about the backstory. We can go along with the entertainment despite the feeling that everything will be alright in the end.

173,imdb3-3,"Reviews are fake, big names don't help a bad movie",2,19 June 2016,"How this movie even received a 7 rating is a good example of how the studios clearly pay people to stuff the ballot boxes. Don't be fooled by the great cast. This one is straight to VOD and everything in this film says ""cash in on the mild success of the first."" What makes fun is the ""how did they do that?"" question. But in this one, they tell you. It's only possible in a movie like this where you get the help of CGI and ask you to believe that the dumb things you see and know couldn't happen just happen. They will definitely not make a third.The first movie in this series was something of a failure because it decided to foolishly allow it's ""heroes"" to pull of feats of wonder that were simply impossible without help from CGI. Hollywood seems to think that pushing the limits beyond is a good thing, forgetting that most of us with a brain get bumped right out of movie land magic once a movie shows reminds us of how false of a premise it is. The suspension of disbelief is gone and you're left just with disbelief.So this film has a problem that is evident early. How can we top the preposterous nature of the first film with something even more improbable and ridiculous? Ten minutes into the film they use CGI twice in one scene that is so absurd that you can't help but feel insulted. No!!! It really IS magic! THIS is what you should expect from this movie. And if you can buy this lazy effort and pretend as if the totally super cool amazingly impossible is somehow possible -perhaps you'll like this film. It's the kind of magic that only superheroes can pull off. And that only works because it's never meant to be real like this is. I hated it. I only stayed with it because of company. Save your money. And even if it's free, save your time. And if you're really curious, just wait for that scene 10 minutes into the movie to decide whether you really want to be dumb enough to waste another hour plus. The script is bad enough and the acting lazy so that you can make that decision easily. At least I've helped you gauge whether you want to watch this film or plan on having an alternative plan to escape from this movie.... like magic.",Now You See Me 2
174,Songwriter_90210,"A Fast-Paced, Confusing Mix of Convolution and Bloat",3,10 September 2016,"There's not much to say about this movie. I wanted to like it because I like so many of the actors in it. But, as we well know, that isn't enough to save any movie. I'm going to say the most compelling character is Lizzie Caplan, and although she hasn't done a lot worth mentioning yet, I do see a bright future for her. Mark Ruffalo is as boring as ever, and although that's actually an attribute for him in films like Spotlight, it's not so great in an action-er. The most boring Hulk in years is now the most boring spy. Jesse Eisenberg is good in many things, with his odd energy and quirkiness, but he's got to play kind of an a$$ in this role, and he's just not fun. If you want to see him in something fun, you have to go all the way back to Adventureland.I would say the best thing about this movie is the scene with the card, where the characters have to pass it to one another, unfortunately what blows the scene, for me, is that there's just too much OBVIOUS CGI and takes you out of the ""realism"" - doesn't allow you to adequately suspend disbelief. Do I feel like I wasted a couple of hours watching this? Yes, pretty much. Mainly, I felt somewhat annoyed or slightly angry at the fact that I wanted to stop watching due to the flaws, but wanted to keep watching because I was hoping the actors would be compelling. I mean, come on! Eisenberg, Harrelson, Radcliffe, Freeman, Caine, even Sanaa Lathan and Dave Franko - who are decent actors - and they couldn't pull this thing off correctly?? I blame the Director, screenwriter, and editor. Yes, the editor. They have been known to ruin films too, and I think the editor had a hand if messing up this one. if you watch, you'll see what I mean. It's all over the place. Should you watch it?

175,klheintz,Stretches too many small scenes out for no reason,5,1 November 2016,"I really enjoyed the first ""Now You See Me(2013)"" as a simple movie with incredible, albeit unbelievable, magic tricks. The sequel takes these tricks to a new extreme and it gives the whole thing a real gimmicky feel. So, suffice to say, it doesn't feel near as intense or invigorating as the original. It's unfair to base a review solely compared to the first movie but it's hard to not see a decrease in quality and how the tricks are displayed.Now to focus on the movie rather than how it compares to the original: The first act of the film is very well done. It captures exactly what you'd expect from watching something like this. It establishes the characters and for some reason they are all a little too happy. Like seriously, they are just peachy after being cooped up for over a year... it's strange and doesn't really fit with all the whining they express. I went off on a tangent but the first act is still very solid. The first ""display of magic"" is very well done and the buildup to the trick was probably the best part of the movie. It then takes the awesome stealthiness of the first act, slaughters it with a cool idea that becomes totally unnecessary, and stretches it on for way too long.The plot is a little strange with a lot of double crossing that doesn't really carry any kind of impact and is a little hard to keep track of without the knowledge of the first movie. Also, for some reason, absolutely everyone shown in the film just loves magic.Overall, it's not a garbage film.

The first one left us on a kind of cliffhanger, and now it tells us the rest of the story. But apart from the great actors Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco and Morgen Freeman coming back for another magic trick we also get another surprise guest. And that's Daniel Radcliffe.

177,zimmerblake,What happened?,4,3 September 2017,"The first movie wasn't anything to be proud of but it was at least entertaining. This sequel jumped way too off base from its foundation for a franchise that hasn't gained that kind of leeway yet. Also, Lizzy Caplan is awful. I understand the new thing is to have ugly girls hook up with handsome men as this is Hollywood's low-IQ attempt to get back at all the movies before where ugly men always hooked up with beautiful women. However, at least in those old movies the ugly guy had a redeeming quality that made him appealing. Lizzy Caplan is boring, ugly, forced and useless. Her character does not matter to the story which means she is supposed to be a comic relief but she is more like a foot. Her and that shoe lady from Sex and The City could be twins. They both look like feet. James Franco's brother obviously just read the scene right before he shot it, as he sounds like he is reading from a teleprompter. Jesse Eisenberg is still wondering if he's cool. Woody Harrellson doesn't know where he is. Daniel Radcliffe looks coked out but mad about it and makes a joke that he dabbled with magic in school...cause the filmmakers want to remind you he was Harry Potter as you definitely forgot. Michael Caine is snobby and British, just in case you forgot that this is the only character he plays. Mark Ruffalo is confused. They should make a movie with Ruffalo and Mark Wahlberg and call it The Marks. In the movie they will both just say ""huh?"" and look confused. They shall win golden bodies.",Now You See Me 2

At first you're presented with a confusing introduction, followed by an even more confusing continuation and further confusing plot twists that make absolutely no sense to anyone.That and the fact that they spend more time showing how magic tricks are done than showing them in action or concentrating on character development or romance. In fact at the end something happens between two of the horsemen and everyone in the room watching the movie looked at one another in confusion... What just happened? Why? To top it all off, the musical score sounds like it's straight out of TV shows like Castle or Nash Bridges with a playful, repetitive, ""free stock music"" sounding instrumental piece that starts out as annoying and by mid movie, winds up being all out irritating.Their only saving grace that gets them 4/10 is the fact that they used a cast of pretty decent actors but one is left to wonder: How the hell did they talk Morgan Freeman into actually playing in a movie this bad? Maybe he hadn't read the script or maybe they threw a bag of money at him. In either case this is the perfect example of a movie sequel quickly scratched together to achieve only one thing: Profit.Cheaply made, cheaply scripted, cheap special effects, cheap everything but the entry price.

180,rohonnag,This one lacks the magic and fun !,5,18 June 2016,"The first movie had a relentless pace and fun magic tricks, some of which, actually worked on the audience! It had charm and a pseudo smartness which fell away when inspected too closely, but that movie disguised it PRETTY well with misdirection and actually followed its own advice, the closer you look, the more you will miss out on. But unfortunately, this sequel is rather by the numbers and has none of the cleverness and charm which the audience were expecting. Just like the previous movie, the four horse men are just patsies in someone else's plan and the whole movie is spent trying to figure out who and why. From the stale opening to the lame first act, this movie drags along. Halfway through, there were more yawns than cheers from the audience. The ending twist / surprise (or the Prestige as Michael Caine himself said in the Nolan movie) Is weak, inconsistent with the previous movie and lacks any kind of punch.Lizzy Caplan replaces the beautiful Isla Fisher and the movie is all the more awkward for it. The twin role by Woody Harrelson is at times funny, but ultimately it has no pay off and seems like a useless subplot. Michael Caine reprises his role from the sequel and he seems to be tired and not enjoying himself at all. Daniel Radcliff is severely miscast in his role and he comes across as Harry Potter acting like he was megalomaniac. This role need a serious creep factor which Elijah wood brought in for sin City, unfortunately Radcliff fails miserably. This movie is obviously partly produced by china as it involves a lot of its action taking place in Macau and the inclusion of the Chinese actors is a bit jarring. But this seems to be the new trend in Hollywood, co-financed by China. Karate kid, Transformers 4, Iron man 3 all went this route and this film really suffers for it The plot of such a movie should be so fast paced that the audience has no chance to think and they will just enjoy trick after trick. But this movie miserable fails in that too. It's boring, its clichéd and not enjoyable! I wish this was an amazing sequel, but it sadly falls way below the mark.Rating: 5/10. No really good reason to see this. Instead see the original again, it was much better!

181,picassomanhdan,Unfortunately stopping at mere a decent sense of humour,6,8 September 2016,"My overall impression of Now you see me 2 is a satisfactory feeling. Everything is nicely done without any conspicuous flaw. The twist in the plot is interesting, while the driving forces of the characters to take actions are brilliantly falling into places without conflicting one another. Of course, the illusory effects are awe- struck and have no room for criticism.However, I still believe that the movie could have been better. By making Thaddeus Bradley and Lionel Shrike friends so as to resolve the conflict between Thaddeus and Dylan Rhodes, the movie hinders itself from continuing harnessing this. The same applies for the Eye: the representation of the Eye manifests at the end of the movie, leaving no uncertainties left behind. Had such details been left unanswered,viewers would have a wider opportunity to let their imagination kick in.Nevertheless, watching this is a good laugh and making the time well spent.",Now You See Me 2
182,AussieMovieReviews,"A bumper cast, with a not so bumper script.",5,24 August 2016,"5/10. In this sequel we once again see the horseman come together to pull off some more unbelievable magic. I quite enjoyed the first film and was looking forward to seeing this, and although it wasn't too bad, and was at times OK, really I found it to be quite lacklustre and even a bit boring. Not sure about the director choice with Jon M Chu, who directed Justin Bebier's believe, which I obviously have never watched but not sure how he landed this gig. Eisenberg, Ruffalo and Harrelson all were OK but weren't really given a story or script worth their talents. There was no wow factor here that we got in the first film under director Louis Leterrier.

It was a unique movie about something mystical and clever- magic! However, I was quite disappointed by the second movie. While the first movie had a fine story line and some intelligent scenes that caught the eyes of the audience, the second movie seemed to focus mostly, and almost only on the visual effects. It was very entertaining to watch the magical scenes, but it was way too unrealistic and lacked in depth of explaining the actual tactic of the magic performed. The first movie did a much better job planning the acts they performed all around the country, making the magic more interesting and still thrilling. There was just one scene in the second movie that seemed clever to me- the scene when the team passed around the card with the chip around the room without being noticed by the guards. Although such scenes may seem unnecessary in the actual plot, I think they are the highlights of these kinds of movies and the reason why most people watch these kinds of movies.",Now You See Me 2

We saw it coming. There are no surprises anywhere in this film. The story was hollow, and the actors didn't even pull it together.

188,WildWombatt,"Decent movie, but many factors in the film were unnecessary",6,23 August 2016,"I can not emphasize more that many elements in this film were not needed or completely unnecessary. The first film was fun and entertaining, but you can't say the same for this sequel.To start on a positive note, this isn't a bad movie as some reviews have made it out to be. It is quite decent and it's somewhat entertaining. I felt there were several scenes in this movie that was very fun to watch, and at the same time, captivating. The new Horsemen is a great character, and I really liked this person! The acting was good, as expected from the cast just like the first movie.My main issue with Now You See Me 2 was that it contained extra ""fluff"" that wasn't needed. There is a certain character they introduced in this film that did nothing for the movie. If you were to completely remove this person, the movie wouldn't even change. Additionally, this character was just plain annoying and his role took up time and space in this film. Several times in the film they would explain or show you how the tricks were made, and often times, you do not need to hear or see it to know how they did it. Aside from SOME great tricks and illusions, the majority of the magic show this movie presented were insignificant and easily forgotten.Overall, okay movie - great cast, except for the one unnecessary character. The movie is decent to watch and had scenes and moments where it shined, but there were far more things that could have been removed, and in place, they could have added better and more entertaining tricks and illusions as the first movie did.",Now You See Me 2

Unfortunately the action in this film, magic tricks, sleight of hand, hypnotizing people, is simply unbelievable - in a bad way. This is not an alternate universe with different rules of physics. This is not a group of super heroes using their powers, this is not a tale of magic becoming reality, this is simply unrealistic garbage.As for the actors, most notably we have Mark Zuckerberg (played by Lex Luthor) trying to take away the leadership of the ""Horsemen"" from ""Jack"" (played by someone without any screen presence whatsoever). Then we have a new person in the crew, an obnoxious girl, replacing someone from the prequel who I can't remember, because they were just as forgettable as the whole drivel that makes up both stories. We have Woody, Morgan Freeman, Caine, and Harry (Potter). In other words no one likable, unless you like them. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) also shows his unlikable side.I tried to keep this on to help me sleep, but during the action scenes they cranked up the volume (as is customary in movies for some reason) so I ended up switching it off.The extra star I gave is for production value.",Now You See Me 2

There were so many eye-rolling, suspensions of disbelief I kept asking myself, ""Who buys this nonsense."" Apparently with an average score of nearly ""7"" there were quite a few viewers duped by this movie's level of stupidity.

At least the first one had great tricks up its sleeve to amaze people. This one just lacks creativity of plot, of magic, or of mystery.The characters are plain with no sense of mystery or dimension. I don't know how it plummeted from what we saw in the first movie. Even Mark Ruffalo seems to be clinging to a stick, and here we all knew him as the mystic man behind the show. Jesse Eisenberg, manages to bring his signature style of acting to a new level of boring. Daniel Radcliffe seems like a confused child whining away with no sense of direction. Woody Harrelson and Morgan Freeman are fine (as usual), but even they can't save the movie from its uni-dimensional plot.Ah and God, a Deus Ex Machina at the end. Please! The plot had so much possibilities after the first movie, and you end up with this emotional melodramatic crap. All in all, only the first-half before the interval was worth some good laughs, and after the interval, the movie plummeted like Mark Ruffalo's character in the sea.

That being said, the tricks are beautifully done, extravagant but fit with the feel of the movie and are fun to watch.The chemistry between the actors is average. Truth is, Jesse Eisenberg is slightly awkward as an individual so it comes off a bit in his acting some times, but all in all, I enjoyed it like I did the first.

196,Evan_Wheatley,Not enough magic,6,11 April 2017,"This film definitely should have been titled, ""Now You Don't."" Despite my bitterness toward this, I was looking forward to the return of the Four Horsemen this past May. And while this is not a well- made film, there is still a lot of fun to be had.Led by illusionists Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), infamous magicians known as the Four Horsemen are back to entertain and thieve using their skills in deception and sleight of hand. Daniel Radcliffe also joins the cast as tech genius Walter Mabry, who forces the Horsemen to steal a chip that will give him control of all of the world's computers.What made ""Now You See Me"" so entertaining was the chemistry between the Four Horsemen and the energy they brought to each of their shows. A nice subplot about a lone detective hunting down the magicians in between their shows also kept the viewers' interest as they awaited the Horsemen's next spectacle.This sequel offers an abundance of plot and new characters, but not enough spectacle. While Rhodes' subplot is somewhat interesting, the resolution of it undermines the impact of the first film's plot twist. The replacement of Isla Fisher's Henley Reeves with Lizzy Caplan's Lula as the female Horseman was also an unwelcome change.However, in the little time they do have in the spotlight, the Horsemen are once again electric. Their charisma and charm give the film just enough magic to overshadow its flawed storytelling and direction.",Now You See Me 2

This time we have a lady by the name of Lula (Played by Lizzy Caplan) who, to an extent replaces Isla Fisher. She's actually really funny and charming, to say the least. All the characters are exactly as the same as they were in the first one. We have a new villain by the name of Walter Mabry (played by Daniel Radcliffe.)

199,Fred_Mopkopf,"The soundtrack by Brian Tyler, folks! The soundtrack!",7,3 August 2018,"I could have written this review for 'Now You See Me I', as my appreciation for Tyler's work started there, but I thought I'd skip it, as he outdid himself in the second part. Yes, the NYSM films are arguably one of the most plot hole ridden franchises in Hollywood (not speaking about the non-decision if magic now is actually an existing thing or not), but strangely I found that after watching the first one and simply accepting the aforementioned fact I was able to really enjoy the second one. And I will re-view the first one as well with this attitude. Those are simply enjoyable films with good actors, nice scenery and lighthearted stories. But I want to direct your focus on something else I rarely read about here: The music by Brian Tyler. You may say about him what you want, but he really created an exception here. In our times, real pop-rock drums (I am not talking programmed drums and loops) as addition to orchestral music have fallen out of grace - Tyler was one of the first to bring them back. And boy, he knows how. In my world, the NYSM score is one of the most inventive soundtracks of our time. Not only does Tyler create a really powerful combination of orchestral and pop/rock music, he also manages to deliver a theme (or leitmotif) one is able to whistle after leaving the theater - also something that is not standard anymore, as soundtracks have become more like acoustic wallpaper these days. The music is really versatile in the most profound way. Just listen to 'The Setup' as a prime example. He morphs through all kinds of style from pop, rock, soul, swing and jazz in one single piece. And his real drums lend a power to the music that is unprecedented. Others have also started to incorporate this style of drumming in their music, but never as virtuosic as Tyler does here. If you like popcorn flicks, give the NYSMs try, and if you're into movie scores, keep your ears open. An oh, by the way: Listen to 'Can you dig it', his end title version of 'Iron Man 3' - it's right up there on the same level.",Now You See Me 2
200,erkucz00,A Fantastical Thriller,8,17 June 2016,"Now You See Me 2 is a great movie. By definition, it is however nothing new. It uses the same formula for success as its predecessor, of an all-star cast, twist heavy plot, and (CGI-assisted) breathtaking magic stunts.All of these things are well developed, just as in the original. The characters especially are given much more intentional treatment, and their development is much more effectively intertwined into the story. One bad thing about this film, (Its reason for my giving it an 8, and not a perfect 10) is that it suffers from what is popularly known as ""sequel-itis"". It capitalizes upon what made the first film great, but unfortunately gets a bit caught up in the spectacle of showing people something they have never seen before.In the end though, what determines the merit of a movie, is the level of enjoyment it offers.

210,jamie-carrick,Down With A Case Of 'The Sequel',6,28 August 2016,"I rated the first film in this series a 10/10 because I was completely enchanted by it. I had never watched a movie like it before in my life.As with any sequel, that illusion was gone (no that pun was not intentional and no I'm not deleting it). While I still enjoyed the movie as a whole, it lacked the spark that the first one brought to the screen. As with my review of the last one, I will list the things I liked and things I didn't.The good parts: The sequence where they passed the card around. I thought it was imaginative, really. Others have passed it off as being unrealistic with a lot that could easily have gone wrong, but that's the whole point of the movie. They're highly skilled illusionists and magicians. Jack is one hell of a card trickster. I spent the time trying to work out how the stick got in the card in the first place!-The performances. As with the first film, I was impressed yet again with the performances. Mark Ruffalo brought it once again, with more depth to his character this time around. Morgan Freeman never fails to steal the screen. Dave Franco did a great job with his still limited material to work with. Jesse Eisenberg had arguably a smaller role than the first one, but his work is good as always. Lizzy Caplan continues to prove herself as more than just ""Janis Ian"" with every role she takes and even though she was there as Isla Fisher's stand in (and the comedic relief) she really did well in my opinion.-The twists. I saw more of them coming this time around, but that doesn't diminish their effect. When the characters are fooled, so are the audience (most of the time).The things I didn't like about it: -I miss Isla Fisher. Yes, I know she was pregnant (and will be back for the third instalment) but I still missed her. Henley was a large part of my love for the first film and it was weird to see the other three without her. As I said, Lizzy Caplan was a good character, but Henley was missed. Hey, at least the movie addressed her absence instead of just replacing her for no apparent reason.-*sigh* this one pains me to say. Daniel Radcliffe. Look, I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd and Daniel Radcliffe has a special place in my heart, but he can't act. Yeah, I'll be that one guy who says it. He can't act. It felt as though he was trying too hard to emulate David Tennant's portrayal of Kilgrave in Marvel's Jessica Jones at some points. I didn't really believe his performance and he doesn't really make a good villain. I guess that might be because he'll always be Harry Potter to me.-Dave Franco remained fully clothed yet again. I stated this flippantly in my last review, but I'm still bitter about it. The same can be said for Mark Ruffalo because damn he looked great in this movie.So, overall, not as good as the first one, but nobody expected it to be. Sequels are curses upon themselves and, as iconic as the first film will always be to me, this was a solid effort at a follow up. Of course I'll watch the third film (I'm guessing it's the finale) and I assume I'll rate it lower than a 6.Well, maybe not considering Isla Fisher is back.",Now You See Me 2

This attempt backfires as the plot becomes bloated and too complex to understand towards the end of the movie, and the tricks become unconvincing.The Four Horseman, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Lulla (Lizzy Caplan), are hiding and the FBI are searching for them. They have been waiting for over a year to return to the stage and the leader of the Horseman, Dylan Rhodes, played by Mark Ruffalo, orchestrates there comeback. But as there jubilant return seemed to be going smoothly, the stage is hijacked by Walter Mabry, played by the magical Daniel Radcliffe. The magicians are then sent to Macau, where Walter awaits them. His goal is find and steal a computer chip with the ability to decrypt all of the data in the world using the Four Horsemans thieving skills. Rhodes is arrested as the FBI find out about his connection with the Horseman, but he escapes and gets a call from Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), the magician he blames for the death of father, who says he is able to help Dylan. But the deal can only be done if Dylan can get him out of prison. This plot seems easy enough to understand, but as the movie continues to develop, it becomes a whole lot more complicated than you would've thought. The movies continuing story becomes implausible, in particular the part about the computer chip. There are many things I enjoyed with the movie but there also seems to be a little problem after that. As a whole, the visuals are really good, but there are times were it goes a bit too far (back to implausible). The cast and acting was good, but the characters are very much the same as in the first movie. There is nothing new about them, with the exception of Mark Ruffalo's character. We are given a better and more thoughtful backstory about his past, and more emotional understanding. Out of the horseman, Woody Harrison's character is the only one whose past is even talked about when his brother comes into the frame, which didn't really do much to the movie. I personally didn't like it that much. I enjoyed Isla Fishers replacement in Lizzy Caplan. She was a fun and provides some positive energy to the group, which contain some boring members. She has a personality which some of the characters lacked, but her role only took a bad-turn when she and Dave Franco's character, Jack Wilder, entered a horribly-developed relationship, which had nonsensical impact on the already bloated story. As long as the team had chemistry, which they did, I was fine with some of the minor problems.The tricks were impressive but I didn't find the 'wow' factor like I did in the first movie. Also, as Thaddeus was a magic debunker, I would've liked, even for a brief minute or two, for him to explain how some of the tricks worked, which would've helped the audience, but also expand his role in the movie, especially as he is such a great actor. Continuing on with the tricks, I wish that they didn't all have to have some sort-of CGI work on them. One of the things I liked about the first movie were some of the tricks didn't require CG work at all because they were entirely performed by the magician. Though I know that the people performing the tricks are not magicians, they could've at least applied some free-hand stuff for the actors to perform.Overall, the movie, despite its bloated story and extensive CGI work, was entertaining and fun to watch. It has some resemblance to the first movie, which I didn't entirely enjoy, and hope that if they do make a third (I hear they are) that they make a more believable and different story, continuing on with some of the great visual effects.",Now You See Me 2
213,stanpriest,Really let me down,1,23 March 2017,"The first was so much fun and so good. This one...what happened? This was just bad. I hope you don't waste your time hoping for a fun time this is just a bad movie. Not sure how it went so far off track but I did not like it and felt bad while I was watching it. It seemed like a bad imitation of a movie. There are some great actors in this movie so how did it end up this bad? Even the great actors seemed to be really fake when they acted, it was not believable. I was not interested for a majority of the movie and it seemed to take forever to go anywhere, when it did make a point it was a let down. Overall this just didn't work. I really enjoyed the first movie, this one left me frustrated.",Now You See Me 2
214,evamatijevic,It's better than the overall grade suggests but...,7,10 December 2020,"The first time I watched this movie I was still in high school and I loved it. Four years later, I'm constantly recommending it to my younger sister (who is still in high school) but I'm not as big fan as I once was. All the fun, magic bits are still kinda fun but I guess it's true that magicians should never reveal their secrets.Characters are less interesting than I remember, with Lula being the biggest disappointment. She is no longer this cool, outspoken and loud character I wanted to be like - she is just loud now. And for all the future script writers, one way too make a female characters be ""like all the other girls"" is to make her state that she is not, in fact, ""like all the other girls"". Btw, I finally understand why everyone keeps saying that Jesse Eisenberg acts like he doesn't know ""Social Network"" is over.Furthermore, as far as I can remember, all other important movie bits (background, costumes, script for like 75% of time) were perfectly fine. Or rather, perfectly fine for when you have nothing else to watch.",Now You See Me 2
215,sfgebel315,Magic & Comedy Trying to Mask That It's Just Another Sequel,7,20 June 2016,"Much like any sequel, it's not as good, but it gives us another crack at the world we liked enough for there to be a sequel in the first place. Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg), Jack (Dave Franco), and Merritt (Woody Harrelson) are still in hiding from their ultimate trick. Henley (Isla Fisher) has left, stated to have been fed up with their year and counting of hiding. Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) has brought in a new female, Lula (Lizzy Caplan) so the Four Horsemen can resurface and pull off another ultimate magic show. However, a new player on the board usurps them and Dylan's cover with the FBI is blown. This disaster of a comeback was orchestrated by Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Merritt's ""evil twin"" Chase. Mabry wants the Horsemen to steal a computer chip thingamajig, but as we all know, that is only the surface of the plot. Not going to lie, I actually like Caplan's Lula better than Fisher's Henley. There I said it. If a third film is made--as the ending suggests--I hope she stays with the rest of the cast. That being said, ""evil twin"", really? But I digress...Aside from Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Hunger Games: Catching Fire I'm not entirely sure how often a sequel equals or surpasses it's predecessor. Usually it doesn't, simply because it can't. Therefore, I'd ignore the criticism that is solely based on this being number two and focus more on the criticism about the film itself.For the fact that I was having a bad day and needed a simplistic film with a good laugh, this was just the fix. However, I was surprised at how simplistic it was. The first film was well ""WOW"" is really the only word to describe it. We delved back into the world of magicians and trickery, and that mixed with the Leverage element of righting wrongs, made it a very entertaining film. Yet it was more thriller with the FBI agent trying to catch the ""criminals"". The magic was secondary. The sequel places the magic first and foremost, which became too much. Too many tricks that we can't keep up with and can't believe. Part of the magic of magic is believability, but when the tricks are happening at lightening-speed and so frequently the audience has no choice but to sit back and just nod. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun to watch. But there are four magicians all playing tricks, mixed with the other plot twists, and really the film is just magic tricks in sequential order that without the film would fall apart. What was even worse is that I figured out the ending right away. Not the very very end, but the ending with the ""antagonists"". It was like a Las Vegas welcome sign that was impossible to miss. I'm still trying to decide if that was intentional. If you see the film you'll see that they once again have three tricks leading to the finale, and with each trick the magician stresses how it's important for the audience to pay attention. So I did, which is why I figured it out so quickly. But like I said, perhaps that was intentional...though if it wasn't then the film loose significant points in my book. I will say that once again we had plenty of comedy between the four horsemen. That was entertaining in and of itself.Overall I would say the film is good. Good enough that I don't regret seeing it, good enough that I would likely see a third if it is made, but still just another sequel all the same.",Now You See Me 2
216,monsieurnikhil123,Messier than the First Movie,7,22 August 2016,"The Reason that i like NOW YOU SEE ME was no matter how some scenes were absolutely Unbelievable,The writers tried to explain how the magic tricks were done and how they weave into the plot.But NOW YOU SEE ME 2 fails to do the same by the end you feel like you watched a messy plot with no proper explanation but the movie still managed to entertain .With interesting New additions of Daniel Radcliffe and Lizzy Caplan the movie turns out to be entertaining.Bringing back the original cast members was so much fun all the actors do a good job,I liked how the filmmakers connected with its predecessor ,Most of the First half was entertaining but the second half is a let down the plot gets messier in the second half but still it is worth a watch.",Now You See Me 2
217,frenchjuice,Would have been better if it came out 30 years ago,3,19 June 2016,"Now You See Me 2, directed by Jon Chu (that rhymes!) is a sequel to an enjoyable Now You See Me made in 2013. This film however was not as enjoyable. What made Now You See Me so enjoyable was the allure of mystery. Like magic we did not know how everything was done and the truth was revealed only after everybody was fooled. In NYSM 2 each tricks are revealed so fast that it doesn't feel like magic. It's like a magician telling you the secret as he is performing it. That's not fun at all. The first film also had the two side that the audience followed, the cops and the magicians. With that the audience could essentially choose a protagonist and follow their mystery, but in this movie everything has been laid out for you and the mystery that was in the first film disappears in the second one.What took me out of the film the most were the small details. For example one character (Jack) teaches the new girl (Lula) a back palm. As a magician myself this is frustrating to see as Lula is shown doing multiple amazing and imaginative magic throughout the movie and yet does not know how to do one of the most fundamental sleights in magic. There are other minute details that makes this movie feel so much like a movie than a real life. Everybody except the cops and the antagonists love the horsemen. There is a really sappy scene in the end where everybody is gathered and they are saying very clichéd dialogues. As well the characters felt bland.Speaking of characters, most of them were very one dimensional. All of the conflicts and the character relationships felt like it could have been developed more and since they were not fully developed I did not care as much. There were some enjoyable moments in the movie, and some tricks were fun to watch. The first magic and the card heist being my favourite but even with that it felt very empty when I left the theatre.",Now You See Me 2
218,greg-32117,Turgid,1,4 October 2016,"Fortunately, I saw this on a plane so didn't pay for it. After the illogical and characterless first NYSM, I swore I would never watch a sequel. But it was late at night on a long haul flight, I was bored, and there it was on my screen. So I watched it, hoping for some improvement.It never came. Instead, we were subjected to the same old illogical 'plot' sequences, the same old smug explanations of characters to the clearly stupid audience about how they pulled off the stunts, the same old nonsensical actions, the same two dimensional characters apparently pulling off a giant heist but, in reality, confusing us and boring us senseless. I desperately wanted something to be logical, but nothing was.*spoilers* One such event was the capture of the four leads where they apparently escape down a long rooftop pipe in the US only to end up in Macau. Apparently the bad guy set it all up so that they would escape down the US slide, get hypnotised by the swirling shapes inside the pipe and fall asleep (while sliding down), then get taken at the bottom of the slide by the bad guy's men, put on a plane to Macau (all without waking), then put into an identical pipe in Macau (still unconscious) then wake while sliding down the pipe to find themselves in a restaurant in Macau. Seriously, Mr Scriptwriter? Seriously? But the worst was this. *spoilers ahead* Towards the end of the movie, in a series of highly improbable events, the four main characters get themselves caught in order to get onto the bad guy's plane in order to get themselves thrown out of the plane in order to end up in the middle of the Thames on a pre-placed barge with huge lights and cameras that no-one spotted ahead of time in order to reveal who the real crooks were. Seriously? They planned the whole thing???? SERIOUSLY? Does the scriptwriter think we are all moronic? And then we are subjected to a long and illogical 'resolution' which makes no sense and where the mysterious 'Eye' is waved in our faces as a highly unlikely deux ex machina.Avoid this like the plague. As Shakespeare said (about better things) full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.",Now You See Me 2
219,dmbelafan,Demands too much of the viewer while offering little in return,3,17 March 2017,"I watched the first installment of Now You See Me expecting it to be fun and clever, which it was. A fast-paced romp, it touched on classic themes of both heist movies and magic movies, while remaining original in its twists and turns.Now You See Me 2 borrows from similar themes, but demands an impossible level of suspension of disbelief from the viewer. I'm not usually one for eye-rolling, but I found plenty of opportunities in these two hours.As in the first installment, we are again asked to believe in a theatrical take on hypnosis that is unironically comical in its brevity and delivery. We are further expected to believe that there are numerous masters of this art, all of whom can be instantly captivated by one another on a whim. While I cracked a smile the first time, it's clearly nothing more than a convenient way for the writers to fill obvious plot holes.Laws of physics do not exist in this film, beginning with the horsemen's impossible card- bouncing shenanigans. Later, in a more glaringly obvious gaffe, one questions the water- drop strobe effect that a filmmaker apparently saw in their high school physics class without listening to the teacher's explanation. While enough strobes would indeed have appeared to ""freeze"" the raindrops, they would have continued to drench both performer and onlooker relentlessly.Then there are the moments left unexplained, from the belt taken without a master thief noticing, to the ludicrous moment of Jesse Isenberg dissolved into a puddle (good lord that somehow seems even more ridiculous as I type it), to just how exactly none of the numerous security guards noticed a damn playing card being thrown around a clean room. And when in the world did they find the time to set up all the gear for their final acts?While the film had some bright spots (Ruffalo's fight/escape scene comes to mind), not even the performances of good actors could save this movie from the impossible tasks the writers asked of them.

222,Callam_10,"Holy crap, this blew my mind",10,10 October 2016,"Like every movie these days in go in with the same old scepticism, not expecting much and with a few hours to kill while the fallout 4 download kills the bandwidth i decide now was a good time as to watch this.ACTORS -- I knew nothing about this movie before going in so was pleasantly surprised to see Jesse Eisenberg in there, followed with James Franco, the girl.... i cant remember the name of but I've seen her somewhere before. of course they had Daniel Radcliffe in there too (man its weird seeing him act as an adult and not a kid). Definitely a good cast. This actually made me more interested as i liked the actors other work.CHARACTERS -- The characters are mostly great, i really like Jesse's character kind of relate-able. James's character was also interesting and had some good depth to it. The girl was annoying for the most part, and the other guy, i didn't really understand. One of the biggest surprised characters for me was the FBI agent, he was so bad-ass, when i found out he was part of the horsemen that shook up the ground work. Daniels character was definitely one of the best characters in the movie in how hes a pure mastermind (well he thinks he is) and is so cocky about everything. His dad is a pure knob. that's all there is to say about him.LOCATIONS -- A lot of the movies locations are great, my personal favourite was of course the Las Vegas type city. Whats not to love. The China location was okay but kinda bland and boring. A surprising weird place (in the sense of what transpired there) was the cube room with the massive computer).STORYLINE -- Story was pretty much easy to follow, the odd time i had to rewind a bit to see what i missed and a couple of times was confusing but at the end a lot of things get cleared up and fills in the missing pieces. the story-line with Morgan Freeman confused me most, one minute he was a good guy, next he was a bad guy, then a good guy? good luck trying to figure that out.INTERESTING PARTS -- Some particular interesting parts for me where, the ending, the part where there in the room with the massive computer after they've stolen the chip and have to hide it from security, so they sneakily pass it around amongst themselves, flip it between hands and all kinds of craziness. The fight scene with the FBI agent was another great scene where you see this unassuming guy whoop like 10 guys asses and save Jesse's character. ENDING -- Wow, is literally what i said, i don't think a movie ending has ever surprised me this much. From the story-line something was obviously building up but seemed like it failed then boom, id love to tell you what happened, but then it wouldn't have the same impact. The explanation and flashbacks do a great job filling in the blanks and showing how the big reveal was executed. RATING -- 10/10 - an incredibly interesting movie to watch, everything had me glued to this movie, down from the crazy card tricks right up to the big finale. This should definitely be on your watch list.",Now You See Me 2
223,alexalinia-554-626627,Worse Than The First - Terrible Everything,1,21 August 2016,"The first one was a little better, but still had the terrible acting, despite the magic of Mark Ruffalo and Woody Harrelson, they were unable to rescue anything. Now they decide to add one of the worst actors ever in the history of acting, Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel needs to understand he was just the right face for Harry Potter and that is it, he wasn't there for his acting abilities. In this movie and anything he's tried after Harry Potter, it proves this fact. To put him as a nerdy geek is one thing, kinda plays to his terrible acting, however to play him as a global criminal mastermind, that's just idiotic, for this I blame the writers and directors, shame on you idiots. Jesse Eisenberg acting roles has always bemused me, he wasn't the only one who destroy Superman vs Batman, there was a whole load of crap in that movie. But his one dimension ""acting"" as he believes it to be destroys the mood of any movie. I understand he writes, produces and directs, perhaps stick to that?? Lizzy Caplan's addition to the quirky loudmouth lady sidekick is just odd, can't tell if it is her acting or just terrible symmetry for the role. But no....just no. It saddens me to see Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson and Michael Caine agreeing to play in these dog gone godawful movies, I can a only assume they need a paycheck.

224,ellscashncarry,"Like with the first film, very entertaining. But unlike the first film, this is poor!",6,30 June 2016,"As a film this really is poor. On practically every level it falls down Now You See Me 2 picks up directly where the first film left off and the film follows a similar pattern – The 4 (or 5?) horsemen, performing larger-than-life magic with the aim of providing for those less fortunate or exposing those who do wrong. However, unlike the first, their motivations behind each of these stunts are a little less clear and certainly less meaningful. In fact inconsistent or unlikely character motivations and actions are a problem throughout the film (with supporting characters as well as the leads).Then there's the fact that this plot is so unrealistic and beyond the realms of possibility that it makes the first script look practically normal. The script in itself is a problem it's messy, incongruent and forced – ""well we need to have a shootout/car chase, otherwise it won't be cool enough"".Then there's the fact that Isla Fisher's character has left the gang and although briefly explained at the beginning of the film, is never mentioned again. Yet her replacement (played by Lizzy Caplan) is not only treated as if she's been there since the beginning, but also held responsible for all the actions she wasn't around for in the first film. I get the feeling it might have been easier for her just to play Isla Fisher's character (Katie Holmes-Maggie Gyllenhaal in Batman style) rather than trying to shoehorn in a different character. And talking of characters – Daniel Radcliffe's character is atrocious. I don't want to give anything away but he is such a stereotypical, spoilt, British man it's untrue. Moreover his acting in this was reminiscent of all his appalling, wooden performances from the early Harry Potter films And just I was starting to believe that maybe he could act!And then there are issues around plot holes, speech which is purely for the viewers' benefit, seemingly irrelevant sub-plots and a ridiculously backwards ending which doesn't appear to make much sense.So how the hell, given all these problems, does it give it get a 6 I hear you cry? Well, as with the first, it is still thoroughly entertaining. It's light-hearted fun, which isn't really tackling any of the world's serious topics and as a spectacle is still great. Sure I found myself thinking of several occasions 'my god this is garbage', but it didn't annoy me. It's the kind of film where you can laugh off the issues and appreciate the fun parts.In summary, if you liked the first one, I certainly wouldn't discourage you from seeing NYSM2. I'd just go in with limited expectations and an acceptance that many aspects of it aren't going to be very good. If you have those two things you'll probably enjoy it thoroughly, despite all its flaws.",Now You See Me 2

The movie is an enjoyable dumb film that requires you to turn off your brain,it is also my new guilty pleasure film with magic tricks that are undeniably inconceivable with the power of visual effects.Characters are dull which you won't feel startle of them or even care cause you know they can get a way out of their dumb problems,they feel invincible and you won't get an emotional connection cause all of them are unvarying(Except for the Hulk's character) but only saved by their chemistry cause is on point.Plot is uninteresting and that's all.There is so many continuity errors and pacing issues in the film that can be sometimes noticeable.The movie is cliché or predictable and it makes this film just so generic,mediocre or just a dumb popcorn flick. Now You See Me 2 isn't as entertaining as it's predecessor,it didn't brings new to table but brought us the predictable formula and tricks that wants you to throw you brain on the cinema floor or drink a lot of alcohol to get drunk in order to fully enjoy the film if you are a type of person who question everything or skeptic and always nitpicks or too smart to watch this film.",Now You See Me 2
226,shanitajohn,Now You Don't,5,27 June 2016,"First, let me say I loved Now You See Me. It wasn't a ""guilty pleasure"" or a ""cheesy movie."" That's something pretentious people say to excuse themselves for enjoying a film we all know ain't gonna win any Oscars. But NYSM was a good movie.Remember how immediately Jesse Eisenberg looked you right in the eye, dared you to ""look closer,"" then performed a simple, real-life illustration that if it worked (and it worked on me) was enough to earn your suspicious surprise and childish delight for the next hour and a half? That twinkle, that sparkle of harmless deception designed to bring joy—what Melanie Laurent's character championed for the entire first film— that's what's missing from NYSM 2.I had hoped NYSM was a stand-alone film. I didn't want a second one to come along and upset the motivations of the first, but that's exactly what happened. Regardless, in this review I'll avoid my frustrations with the plot and focus on the other elements I felt detracted from the movie's potential. First off, the magic.The big question of NYSM remains unanswered. NYSM 2 still hasn't decided for itself, whether or not it believes in magic. This makes it impossible for the viewer to choose if what they're seeing is supposed to be a cunning illusion or something mystical, otherworldly or paranormal. The quick-changes, inexplicable transformations and thin- air disappearances don't even attempt to poke at realism. I liked NYSM because it wasn't always blatantly obvious which ""tricks"" were possible to recreate live (regardless of how complicated or expensive) and which were clearly intended to work only on a film level. Early in NYSM 2, I began thinking, ""that's not possible"" but without any of the thrill or allure of a person who knows their senses are being made to work against them.People whine about how much ""suspension of belief"" NYSM asks of them as if all movies don't require at least the slightest measure of the same thing. This franchise didn't invent magicians, hypnotists or illusionists. But, at some point it stopped caring about whether or not it stayed true to the possibilities and limitations of the art form (without supernatural intervention). This should have been impossible to do with David frickin' Copperfield advising, but apparently not. I didn't believe my eyes. Not for a second.As far as visuals go, my only problem was that, at times, it felt like the action existed to support the special effects and not the other way around. There's a scene where the magicians must keep discreetly passing an item between themselves. It looked awesome, but went on for entirely too long. Shall I over-explain it in cumbersome, wordy detail? Don't worry, I won't.The heaviest expositions in NYSM existed to move the story forward or to deliver the full impact of a sequence of events. It didn't feel intrusive. Somehow, both the dialogue and the exposition (of not only tricks but of motives, intentions, plot) became distracting and exhaustive. Maybe it worked in NYSM because we were learning trade secrets as part of an investigation. This time around it felt like, ""Did you get it? Did you get it? Did you get it?"" Yes. I got it.Rounding out my frustrations were some poor character choices.In NYSM, Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) was such a strong female lead. Assistant- turned-Magician, she more than held her own in the all-male Horsemen line up. When I saw that she wasn't returning I was disappointed, but for only as long as it took me to read the name Lizzy Caplan. I adore Lizzy Caplan. Mean Girls, Cloverfield. She sealed her ownership of my heart in Party Down. I assumed Caplan was coming on to pick up Henley's reins and ride. Not so. Lulu, the newest addition to the team, is a fine magician but she's fidgety, rambles aimlessly and is immediately too preoccupied with Jack Wilder for her own good. I didn't hate Lulu. I was just bummed that she was so flat. The movie had, like 3 female characters. It just felt like a missed opportunity. Also, I wouldn't hold high hopes for Lulu's crush on Jack. Remember Alma Drey, the Interpol agent who won Rhodes' heart by the end of NYSM? I almost didn't. I mean, gimme a throwaway line, ""She's in South America."" I don't know, something.There were actually a fair amount of character development points that irked me. Things even the brilliance of Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Mark Ruffalo couldn't barrel over. I won't even touch the Shrike / Bradley story arch. But NYSM 2 finally takes things too far by casting Woody Harrelson as his own identical twin brother, Chase McKinney ... HOW did things GO SO WRONG for this film!!?? Do I love Woody Harrelson? You're GD right I do! Did I ever want to see him act alongside himself as his own bizarre, quasi-effeminate twin brother? No. No, I did not. It's bad enough that this film couldn't get away from familial power struggles if it locked itself in a safe and sank to the bottom of the Thames. But this twin business, unforgivable.So, there it is, another 5 of 10-star review from a die-hard fan of the first installment. Hollow magic, drawn out special effects sequences, cringe-worthy dialogue and exposition, almost none of the dazzling stage time the Horsemen established in round one and finally, poor character choices ending with the McKinney twins.I wanted so badly to love NYSM 2, but as I feared some really poignant things got wrecked and left behind in the path it cleared for a third movie. Oh, well.I assume they'll just call it NYSM 3.But if the original was truly ""Now You See Me,"" sadly, the sequel is ""Now You Don't.""",Now You See Me 2

But what I'm taking from this dubious new genre, if you could call it that, is that filmmakers shamelessly exploit and yet devalue the nature of real-life illusionism (i.e. ""magic""), in which the magician actually has to make something work that looks impossible or highly unlikely (it's a trick), by making use of the nearly endless possibilities of film, in which things that would be impossible in real life can actually be accomplished on screen. So we get things like Lizzy Caplan apparently vanishing into thin air in Atlas's apartment, and since magicians, of course, don't divulge how they accomplish their tricks, the film takes advantage of this by doing things that in all likelihood really are impossible — no explanations or credibility necessary. Since we all know that you can do all these things in the movies anyway, what's the point of making them into magicians, when you can watch a Harry Potter movie and you don't really have to wonder how people in paintings can move?",Now You See Me 2

I think the age warning of above 13 for this movie is actually right. My advice is that if you're above 40, it may not entertain you because this film doesn't include much logic among some events that follow one another. Another thing is that this is also a movie about a struggle of saving the world from the bad guys. There many movies like that but this movie saves itself from being boring with the humor & sarcasm of the characters. Magics which we cannot come across in real life help a lot to take the movie to a higher position in the audience's point of view.Best parts of the film: 1. The voyage of the horsemen after they jump through the tunnel. 2. When four of the horsemen are together in a room where they are being searched for a possible theft.3. The magical performances of the horsemen in a city center at a special day of the year.4. The audience may not guess how the film will end, will the horsemen succeed or not?5.

Am I the only one annoyed by the 'no biggie' attitudes of the main characters? I never felt like they were truly in danger. It's just one boring, chaotic dress rehearsal. I picture a twelve year old sitting in the director's chair. This film, and the one before it, are Romper Room mayhem and there's nothing appealing about the script or the acting. Very disappointing. I shouldn't have been foolish enough to think the sequel would be any better, so I take responsibility for being suckered twice. At least I didn't spend a penny to see either one.

This is a movie about the subtle art of slight of hand and illusion its supposed to be mysterious, at least attempt to be subtle in your ""coincidental plot devices"" I know this is a fictional story and in such cases we can be liberal with reality, fine i accept that; however if you are going to give not one but three of the characters the ability to instantly hypnotize people, making them do basically whatever the hell you damn well please, the rest of the show, the fancy lights the trickery all that just seems pointless. Oh but there is a catch people can only be hypnotized when they are off guard. Fine wait for mr baddie to be off guard do your vodoo magic on his mind and make him give his money back to the poor or whatever it is you require. What are the rest of the horsemen needed for.

Sure, it's not a FANTASTIC movie. But I don't think it was meant to be an award- winner or anything. It celebrates the mystery and magic of illusion, and reminds viewers that even today, audiences can still be fooled, if the magician has just enough intuition (and money) to pull it off.I would've given 10 stars, but the romance was poorly executed, and some of the plot elements bothered me.

264,J-fuglen,"Fun, Excitement and Unrealistic Magic",7,17 June 2016,"""Now You See Me 2"" is the sequel for the 2013 movie ""Now You See Me"", and features Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Mark Ruffalo, and as a replacement for Isla Fisher, Lizzy Caplan. Like its predecessor, the movie follows the same behaviour pattern by showing the same amount of crazy, unexplainable magic tricks, so that we, the moviegoers, can feel impressed and amazed. Even though the movie tries to explain some of its many insane magic tricks, some tricks are still left unexplained which leaves me as viewer with an increased skepticism of the lack of realness showed in the movie. I know the movie is supposed to be fun, exciting and nothing more, but it would still have been nice to see some kind of explanation to some of the bigger tricks, that did not involve cards. For the acting part: Lizzy Caplan did a good job as the replacer for Isla Fisher, being both credible and funny. I loved that her humour felt real and not forced, and when I say ""forced"" I mean in a way where scriptwriters make her say one too many funny one-liners, but instead she would say what came to her mind and it worked great. Mark Ruffalo was great and had by far the most emotional story in the movie, which made him more interesting to follow than any of the other Four Horsemen. Daniel Radcliff as the main antagonist also worked great, and I really believed his portrayal of a crazy, sociopathic billionaire. The one performance in the movie that annoyed me was by someone who played a twin-brother to one of the horsemen, and this characters behaviour just got on my nerves throughout the movie. In the end, the movie is a good time with popcorn and soda, and instead of asking yourself, ""how the f**k did they pull that trick of?"" you should just try by going with the flow of the movie and it will give you 2 hours of fun and excitement.",Now You See Me 2

To try and spice it up they tried the twist with Morgan Freeman's character, but nobody believed it, not even Mr. Freeman.THE MAGIC A movie about magic should not be a movie about CGI, which the first movie was and now the second. The Illusionist and The Prestige were doing their magic tricks for the audience IN the movie, for the crowd in that universe. This one does the tricks just for the people watching the movie. Need to make someone disappear? Of course there will be a cut. Need to make someone escape? They simply transform into water. How? Who cares, a magician never reveals his tricks (hint: CGI).

They can also somehow broadcast their tricks LIVE all over the world, on all TVs in all city centers, etc.THE PANDERING TO THE Chinese MARKET Yes I know that ""entertaining"" movies nowadays always have something for the Chinese market: a character, a vase, a flashback scene, etc. But this one went all in: mystical characters that know and see everything, they help the protagonists without a second thought, etc. Oh and did I mention they are literally going to China for some reason, just to show what a great place it is?THE HEIST SCENE (FLYING CARD) God please make it stop. A 10-minutes scene with a quintillion number of ways it can go wrong - everything works out. How to prevent a heist like that? A single security camera in the room and an underpaid guard watching it.

276,abubakar_giwa,Not bad,7,11 June 2016,"Okay, let me start by mentioning I thought the first one was good, different,less predictable especially liked how some of the tricks were explained but ""The Second Act"" well make it too much.I mean this isn't supposed to be a movie on fantasy. It's supposed to be real life magicians. I think the movie was too busy trying to show fancy tricks. An example is the part where they were searched they could all have hidden the card rather than throwing it around. It had some good moments too but overall predictable and average. Not bad, okay. I like magic very much, The Prestige is still one of my favourite movies so I didn't mind the mediocrities in the movie.",Now You See Me 2
277,micky-hutter,"Awesome action, awful plot.",6,21 August 2016,"The cast, the trick effects and the acting are great, but in my humble opinion they are overshadowed by the plot. The biggest magic trick of this movie must have been getting approval for the script. For my taste, even being a huge fan of the ""mind-f*ck"" genre, this plot takes too many turns. In a good mind-f*ck movie, you should be amazed by reveals. In this movie, there are so many small reveals that I cannot even remotely recall how many there were. The last trick was the only reveal that I really appreciated. Overall, I would describe the story as unnecessarily busy. The first film in the franchise was not flawless either, but I felt emotionally more invested in the characters because the overarching story was always clear and only took a handful of twists.",Now You See Me 2
278,Charlie2101,Fantastic...... better than the first!,9,7 July 2016,"If you enjoyed the first film you can't not enjoy this one, the direction is excellent; the acting is superb; the graphics are outstanding; the plot line is ingenious and tight and via science, logic and a hefty amount of money all the tricks performed are very much possible, if put together correctly. Also I think it was a great decision to replace Isla Fisher with Lizzy Caplan as I think she brings more to the role and that extra piece of comedy to the film that seemed to be missing in the previous film. Therefore, I think if you did not enjoy the first now you see me, you shouldn't even bother watching this as it'll be a waste of your time. However, if like me you enjoyed the first film then definitely go and see this movie because you will very highly likely enjoy this movie as much if not, like me, even more. I genuinely believe this is better than the first and is one of the best films I've seen.",Now You See Me 2
279,soccerforecast,Don't be fooled by the magic!,4,12 June 2016,"Well, I have just seen Now You See Me 2 yesterday, and I was pretty let down, no, confused by the plot.And that's where we are gonna start.As a heist/magic movie, Now You See Me 2 obviously has many twists and turns in the story, just like its predecessor. But this sequel has too many twists and turns that they made the fans struggle to understand what the heck was going on. I mean, creating the Daniel Radcliffe's character was good, but making Thaddeus Bradley a good guy? That's a crazy idea! And why would he and Lionel Shrike( Dylan's father) pretend to hate each other? Thaddeus said that it had been a trick, but for what? Why Thaddeus wouldn't be a cop and why Shrike wouldn't be a thieve? They would have fooled a lot of banks and had lots of money, wouldn't they? I would rather see Lionel Shrike came back to life and said he was head of the Eye rather than Thaddeus become a good guy. One more crazy thing is, when the Horsemen found out that the chip they had stolen were fake, then how on earth could it become a real one in the end of the movie? I remembered that Walter( Oh, I remember his name now) had checked that chip and he said it was real.The plot was way too over complicated for any moviegoer to understand.Finally, I just want to say that Now You See Me 2 had truly fooled moviegoers by the magic tricks( Holy *beep*, they were stunning). If you are looking for a good movie this weekend, then skip this one( And Warcraft as well). You might be disappointed...",Now You See Me 2
280,manavtg,A nice entertaining movie albeit lacking that 'Wow' factor that made the first one memorable,8,17 June 2016,"I had very high hopes for this movie after watching the first one because that movie was something new and different. It had an intriguing concept which was wonderfully portrayed on screen. The acting in that movie was solid which is a given when you have talent like Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in the same movie. They all returned for this installment with only Isla Fisher being replaced by Lizzy Caplan. Then there was Daniel Radcliffe, arguably the most famous wizard in the world playing the villain of the movie. Though the irony of this was not lost on me, I felt that however much he tried, Daniel Radcliffe wasn't convincing as a villain. Lizzy Caplan was not good at all with her character being very unconvincing. To me it felt that her whole purpose in the movie was to provide that unnecessary romance subplot with Jack Wilder. This movie still brought those stunning visual effects of the first movie with my personal favorite being the scene with Jesse Eisenberg and the rain during the film's climax. The scene in the middle where the Horsemen had to steal a chip from a heavily guarded location was entertaining to see albeit illogical. I mean whim were the filmmakers trying to convince by showing that not a single guard saw the card being tossed around the room? This lack of logic spoiled what was a great scene visually. The scenes in the Chinese Magic Shop were really enjoyable. Jay Chou's character was especially good with his comedic timing. The main problem of this movie was that it got lost in setting up a convoluted plot. This made the initial half of the movie very dull and boring. Where the first movie kicked off with 4 individual scenes involving magic tricks and then the big bank heist, this one had its first real magic scene during the introduction of Lizzy Caplan's character, which was a really weak scene. This movie had very little actual tricks with actual explanations and it instead relied more on unexplained illusions. The twist that Daniel Radcliffe's character was in fact Arthur Tressler's son was a decent one even though it was a bit clichéd. What made the movie good was its climax. The climax showed us what we wanted to see from the start. Actual tricks with believable explanations which were enhanced by special effects which were a visual treat. It was a gripping climax and it used it's backdrop of the City of London quite effectively. The finale in the middle of the Thames was extremely good and was in my opinion much better than the finale in New York in the first movie. The end reveal that Thaddeus Bradley was in fact partners with Lionel Shrike and was a high ranking member of the eye did not go down well with me. It was a big plot hole for the first movie as why didn't he tell Dylan about this when he was first jailed? It made no sense. But we still got a brilliant scene between Morgan Freeman and Mark Ruffalo due to it so I can ignore that mistake. All in all, this movie is more of a typical summer entertainer rather than the thought provoking one its predecessor was. It got caught in a tad too much storytelling and illogical tricks rather than the ones with an explanation but it still delivered enough to justify there being a third installment in this franchise. This movie should be seen as more of an unrealistic entertainer with a less than average plot but with enough of the visual treat to justify spending two hours in the theater.",Now You See Me 2

Don't waste your money or time. Now You See Me 1 was a surprised movie, it gave a great story line, good balanced character set but when it comes to Now You See Me 2 it is a totally mess, can't understand how they mess with this one. Also the story line of some characters are dull and boring. Also the director tried to mix some amusement to the film by adding Unnecessary stories, but finally the whole movie is a joke. Also I am very much worried about Daniel Radcliffe's decisions to select such movies. He has a great acting ability but he is now wasting that talent. Hope there will not be any further sequels based on this concept.",Now You See Me 2

My complaint would have to be the plot. This is where the spoilers begins: it makes no sense at all that Morgan Freeman is a good guy at the end of the movie. Movies nowadays fell into a trend of trilogy but by having Morgan Freeman to be a good guy at the end. Like who on Earth are willing to go to jail for a year just because I felt the truth will hurt Mark!!?? The twist really felt forced, like Freeman is a good guy because he's Freeman. I felt they missed out on an epic storyline if they were to film part three. Second, I thought the chip was a fake!? I thought the ending would be Woody hypnotize his twin brother and then trade places with him to hypnotize Michael and Daniel because his twin did a weird clap on the airplane when telling the henchmen to throw them out of the plane.

It makes you pay great attention to detail and everything in the movie so you can try to figure out what is going on because the director, Jon Chu did a great job of hiding the secrets that help the horsemen complete their stub its and keep them from falling apart. It is a movie of many quick cuts, pans and zooms to try to hint at how tge horsemen are completing their stunning tricks and to keep your eye away form them sometimes so that for most viewers the story doesn't come together until the end, so they will stay on the edge of their seats.

I called Marvel and asked if they had any more superheroes. They said they had one that transformed into an ant, but I thought that sounded a bit weak and decided to start from scratch. Having only seen the interiors of Hollywood mansions for the past 20 years I thought it was time to reconnect to humanity and I took my jet to Las Vegas and watched a Magic show for 10 minutes. Bingo! I had an idea. I called the studio and told them and they asked if there was going to be real Star Wars super magic, but I said no, regular card stuff. They told me I needed more CGI to appeal to the common man, I said sure, - how about an animated card flying around for 20 mins? That will also compensate for the lack of a real story. We brainstormed for 15 more minutes and came up with many brilliant ideas and here you are, my latest masterpiece. Now I can finally afford that bigger boat.

I know a lot of people already think of this as ""the evil step brother"" of the first one.Let me tell you: It is not! Is this one as exciting as the first one? No it is not. Why, you ask? Well, because it's not the first one! You already know the way this movie is going to work. This is not the kind of cinema that will reinvent the wheel. But it will do it's best to get as close to it as possible? Absolutely!You will see the same kind of surprises (plot wise) that you got in the first one and a good bit more that you DID NOT expect. This is what this movie is about. It, by definition as a sequel, can't be as surprising as the first one (look at the Ocean's series). But it damn sure gets pretty damn close, so let's make that clear from the get go. However, will you be entertained? Heck yes you will! From the beginning of the movie, I tried to anticipate every move the crew makes. Did I do well? Nope. Did I enjoy myself? You better be sure I did!If you go into a sequel, expecting the genre to be redefined, I'm sorry, but it's your own fault.

Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci have bombarded us with this absolutely unoriginal piece of garbage. Mark Ruffalo & Jesse Eisenberg have really dropped their standards here. This totally seems like a forced studio movie which they were contractually obliged to do.There is maybe 20 minutes of this movie that should have made it to the final cut and even this is mainly special effects.

I was also worried about Daniel Radcliff being in this movie but I was proved wrong he did really good for his part in the movie. I was impressed overall with the second movie. A lot of plot twists!

The actors and actresses involved work really well together to create charming chemistry and characters. Unfortunately, there are so many actors involved that some are ultimately wasted/short changed. Michael Caine and Jay Chou are among the first few billed for the film, yet they have little development and do not add much to the story.One aspect of the film I cannot criticize is the action. It is well paced and choreographed, boding together ""magic"" and realistic brawls. Furthermore, the magic/stunts in the film are exceptional and entertaining to watch, despite how ridiculous they really are.The main problem with the film is the actual story and how everything comes together. The story darts around from arc to arc whilst clumsily trying to continue the events of the first film and carry a new story all-together. This results in a disappointing third act as well as out-of-place scenes peppered throughout the movie.

Most of the magic was explained, leaving just enough *not* to please the viewer and enhance the sense of mystery and wonder that all fans of stage magic and street magic will appreciate. This film is a typical sequel that tried to best the previous film and failed dismally.I will not give anything away if you want to see many of the characters again. However, if you are expecting a fascinating plot that makes any sense when you review it later, you will be disappointed. The beloved characters from the first film are sorely abused in this trite follow-up. Instead of following along and learning more as you go, with surprises along the way, this plot is so contrived as to defy belief in a great many places. The reveals are often trifling and superficial, the connections are implausible at best, and the motives and personal growth from the first film are abandoned completely in favor of ""shock"" and ""wow"" visuals, which still fail to impress. A few humorous moments in the film are drowned by the meandering story line, and I was left feeling both annoyed and betrayed in the end.

So many things that you look at do not make any sense for a normal human being to digest. There are many scenes that it looks like they were trying too hard to be entertaining or funny. On top of the the acting is TERRIBLE. The script is TERRIBLE. There are many point when actors even look directly at the camera, loss of continuity in scenes.

The sequel didn't have the same clever elements of the first, and there was a subplot about a twin of one of the characters that added nothing to the film - if they had left that out in favor of a different conflict they might have had room for something else - perhaps an ending more like the first, with a lot more flash and spectacle.

Directing is chaotic and messy in order to make you feel lost and to make you think it's so intelligent that you can't follow everything. But the truth is everything is stupid and lacks credibility. Some movies are doing too much on purpose and it's okay as long as they are not taking themselves too seriously. But here it's the opposite, and I feel like the director is insulting my intelligence.I could also comment one some scenes but I don't want to ""spoil"", especially one that last 10 minutes and brings nothing. It just highlights how stupid is the script. The scene is supposed to be impressive with special effects but makes no sense. It's just an excuse to put as much special effects and ""magic"" as possible.I'm stopping now because criticizing this movie can take hours. The three stars left?

(Kinda reminds me of Avengers vs Age of Ultron, everyone still loved the 2nd one anyway) Even though the 2nd movie have changed its style (instead of doing magic performances for revenge), I think it's going towards a better direction, like the fast&furious sequel. Lots of magic tricks, lots of mind blowing scenes, actions, and funny AF. Jay Chou was a great addition to be added into the film crew. I'm glad that I was able to get invited to watch a pre-screening of this movie. I certainly hope that there's a NYSM 3 that's coming in a few years. Magicians really deserve some serious credit, with the amount of work they are putting into every magic trick they do.",Now You See Me 2
312,bvukusic-st,"Ocean's Eleven, except without the charm, or the wit, or anything really.",3,20 June 2016,"Let's start by saying that the first Now You See Me left me disappointed, but I was able to see how some people might enjoy it as brainless entertainment. I am a big con and heist movie fan, and NYSM and its sequel are obviously inspired by the likes of the Ocean's trilogy, Inside man and The Prestige. The first grabbed my interest with various tricks and twists which left questions that I was expecting to be answered in the movie's final act. The first movie contained nothing of the sort, but what was left was a decent amount of visual effects and good acting to make a fun experience, even if it did leave a bitter after taste.So it feels ironic that Now You See Me 2 fails because it tried to explain itself.Without spoiling the movie, I will sum up the story like this: The squad from the first movie (with a subbed in girl member played by Lizzy Caplan) is outsmarted by a ""shadow organization"" that is out to get them. Two men that stand out from that organization are the snobby millionaire played by Daniel Radcliffe and Woody Harrelson's character's twin brother played by Woody himself. Radcliffe does a good job playing his part, and Harrelson does what I suppose is the best he could do with his added role, seeing as it is probably one the worst written characters this year. I say ""one of the worst"" because it definitely isn't as bad as the new girl member of the team. ""Lula"" is supposed to be an illusionist worthy of the world's most secret magician society, yet she acts like an edgy 16 year old, desperately crushing on Dave Franco's character. This, together with the movie's plot, make the first two acts play out like a cartoon, with no logic or decent motivation behind any of the characters.The magic, I should note, looks great, the visual effects and direction are not ground breaking, but are certainly well done. Yet, as in the previous movie, it is literal MAGIC. Most of the big illusions in this movie are left unexplained, and those that aren't, should have been. Why? Well, perhaps because the writers of this movie seem to think that walking up to someone on the street and snapping your fingers at them is a legitimate way to hypnotize people, or that flashing a person with a UV lit text that says SLEEP will knock them out indefinitely. When an explanation serves its purpose only within the twisted reality of it's movie, it is safe to say that it isn't really a smart explanation, and that this really is not a smart movie, even if it acts otherwise.My friends and I left the theater laughing, dazed by the silliness of this movie. Would not recommend.",Now You See Me 2

Sadly, it fell very short of what it should've carried on.There were some wonderful fighting scenes throughout the movie, in fact more action than the predecessor. There was also more humor to the movie, thanks to the introduction of Lizzy Caplan and the terrific acting by Woody Harrison.Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Dave Franco did a job which was as good as the first part, and definitely was enjoyable. The acting was so good that the audience, and especially me, did not miss Isla Fisher one bit.The horrible disappoint was the awful display of Daniel Radcliffe and Michael Caine. The roles they played definitely did not suit them AT ALL. Throughout the movie there was one scene which amazed me and the audience, otherwise the movie was just awful display of it predecessor.

322,smitht-73743,Great but not as good as the first,9,7 June 2016,This is a really great movie but it definitely lacked the flair that the first one had. The magic tricks were great but it kind of sucked how they explained the magic tricks. Woody Harrelson is one of my favourite actors but for some odd reason he played two characters in this film. Jesse Eisenberg also plays a great character and performs some good tricks. Dave Franco's character is just awesome and I must admit that I have been practicing throwing cards at different targets. Daniel Radcliffe plays the villain in this movie which was unexpected but he seriously needs to lose the beard. My God Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are good actors and I was actually pretty surprised when Morgan Freeman turned out to be the good guy at the end. Lizzy Caplan was a good replacement for Isla FIsher and managed to pull off some very humorous scenes. All in all this was a great movie but lacked the tricks that were in the first movie.,Now You See Me 2
323,filmnik7,As good as the first one... Maybe?,8,4 July 2016,"I liked this movie despite the disadvantages it had. The star of the film was still Jesse Eisenberg (who was still brilliant as Atlas) but we got to see more of the other two Horsemen (both Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson were great to watch). The new girl Horseman, Lula, was good. Sometimes she was on the verge of being annoying, but on the whole, she was likable and definitely had a solid character whereas Henley (Isla Fisher from the first film) didn't leave much of an impression on me. Even so, I don't think the Horsemen had the same kind of camaraderie as in the first film. Daniel Radcliffe was interesting to watch. His scenes were always fun, he has a particular knack for doing the simplest things and making them funny. Sometimes though, I got the feeling he wasn't even acting, that he had wandered onto the set and was just being himself. The film seemed to have a fairly simple plot but it tended to wander off. It was definitely sometimes tricky to understand what exactly was happening. I think there's two things that contributed to that - 1) the pace; sometimes several things were revealed to the audience too quickly for them to process fully, and 2) the dialogue. Again, this had to do with the pace, it was just too quick sometimes. My last point, the magic. It was great. It was so exciting and exhilarating to watch them do impossible things (even if they're not real). Not all of their tricks are explained in the film but I think I prefer it that way.",Now You See Me 2
324,t-57044,Awfully disappoiting,3,7 July 2016,"Let me put this straight, this season 2 totally sucks compared to the season 1. The few magic scenes are disappointing. The first magic-show scene is still attractive, but then nothing about magic happens till the final show. In season 1, magic scenes run through the whole movie, and all those magics work perfectly and reasonably. In season 2, it's more like a action movie with many street fights. The new characters are plain unnecessary. Let's say, the appearance of Lula aims at the gender balance. Right, it's important. None of us wants to see a movie without a beautiful face. So, what's the point of the two Chinese characters, that grandma and grandson? I believe the plot goes fluently even though the director cuts out all their scenes. Those trivial characters just distract the audiences' attention from the Horse Men and make the plot dragging and embarrassing. Combined with the lack of magic and additional characters, the plot becomes so distractive that some of the logic mistakes become so confusing. Like, the Horse Men have nothing in Macau, no money, no magic tools, no identity. They are under the supervision and can't leave the city. However, after they save their leader, they are free to go. They suddenly travel to London and have enough time and everything to prepare their final show. By then, they are still required by the FBI and chased by the villains.",Now You See Me 2

The characters were painful to watch act as the lines and script was so awkward, they could not even make it look good. My friend summarized the ""entertainment"" best by imitating the illusions saying, ""It's not in this hand because look! It's in my other hand!"" That corny.

I'd really like to point out that Isla Fisher is a good actress, but she brought nothing to the first movie. She was eye candy. She is better suited for a different type of movie. Lizzy Caplan nailed it and was terrific! Also many previous reviewers didn't mention a new character, Chase, Woody Harrelson's twin brother, who is hysterical and reminds me of mixture of Owen Wilson and somebody I can't quite peg.

For me the ending became a disgrace and it was a disappointment. To sum up the plot turned into a thing like: There is this community called ""the eye"" and they create a problem and then they find new people to replace themselves which should first solve the problem they created without knowing that the eye created it.

I mean the CGI is exactly the point to the parody -- but people also mistook it for a serious film because the film doesn't go crazy enough with it. SECONDLY, it's should've parodied all the characters heavier. The characters clearly are meant for parody as well but they don't strike you like that hard enough leaving the experience a little blunt.Don't skip the film just because unintelligent kids here couldn't figure out it's a parody.Overall, it's decent entertainment if you understand you are watching a comedy (parody), not a serious mystery film which it clearly doesn't claim to be.",Now You See Me 2

Now You See Me was one of those refreshing works that always left you wanting for more. It has to be said that the sequel to the 2013 amazing movie was far from impressive. If the makers had the idea that dazzling the viewers with a lot of hyperbolic cinematography was the way to go, they were sadly mistaken. The many small and episodic routines that were to culminate in to some sort of a grand Finale which were supposed to wow the viewers fell short of achieving that. All things considered, the worst part of the movie has to be Lizzy Caplan's way below average acting and presence in the movie. The movie could have been a little better without her lackluster performance and over the top hollow effort to outshine Isla Fischer (which made her look even more miserable), and hopefully she is given the sack if the makers of the franchise ever plan to redeem themselves with another movie after the second not so indulging effort.",Now You See Me 2

But, when i saw all the whole things, i find out that this movie is really great and very entertaining. Although the plot is easy to guess, but it's quite good for me. It's sad that Henley Reeves not play in this movie, but actually love the whole story from the beginning until the end of this movie. The first Now You See Me was very very good because we don't know the story where to ends and the unpredictable culprit. But this movie is the second one, enjoy it. I watched it yesterday with my friends, 3 of us really liked and enjoy the show, but the 2 of us didn't like it much. Haha",Now You See Me 2
350,davidsonz-54687,"If you want a fast paced, exciting and funny movie packed with incredible visuals, WATCH THIS",9,13 June 2016,"I was saddened to see that Now You See Me 2 is rated poorly both on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. I saw it in cinemas yesterday and it was one of the best movies I have seen in a while, and the two people I went with agreed. I also thought that visually, humour-wise and acting-wise, this movie was better than its predecessor. The visuals are, as usual, incredible. The effects are fantastic and I love the way they show all of the tricks. It's exciting, intense and a bit over dramatic, but hey, that's what you get from the Now You See Me franchise, and I love it. Not only this, but it has a fantastic soundtrack and what can only be described as 'cool' sound effects. They are well placed and frankly, awesome! People are accusing this movie of being overly-CGI, having a bloated plot and being worse than the original, which in my opinion is ridiculous! Obviously it's going to be loaded with CGI - it's a movie about magicians and illusionists! It's far cheaper to use CGI than to actually do the tricks. Not only this, but I failed to find a problem with the CGI. It was done well, not too excessively and definitely used to the movie's advantage. The plot was most certainly not bloated, it had a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining plot arc and the characters were each well developed ( well, as developed as they could have been in this rather fast moving movie). I liked it better than the original. I loved the addition of Lizzy Caplan replacing Isla Fischer (which was done smoothly), and the new objective of the Four Horsemen (which again I won't go into, but was exciting, hilarious and at times even emotional). The acting was great, there weren't any phenomenal performances however, again, this is simply not the type of movie that you go to if you want to watch some great classic or moving story, you go to it to have a good time and to have fun. One standout performance for me was Mark Ruffalo's, but I won't say why because it will breach guidelines and become a spoiler, most likely. Dave Franco's performance as always was charming, Jesse Eisenberg's was funny, Daniel Radcliffe was also great, and of course Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were fantastic. My one reservation was that it was rather predictable. I won't say any specific plot points just in case of spoilers, but I did figure out the basic plot arc before the halfway mark. Then again, this is Now You See Me, and something I loved about these movies was how they can take a basic plot and turn it into something spectacular. If you liked the previous Now You See Me then I'm sure you'll love this. If I were to describe it I'd describe it as Inception, but with less of a tragic backstory and more of a funny, exciting and dramatic plot line and characters. I loved it and cannot wait for Now You See Me 3!",Now You See Me 2

The casts are well-known, and the film's visual effects & humor was amazing and fresh. I surprised by the director, Mr. Jon M. Chu, in his mind and work to make this great film. The story was told in unique ways and I amazed by the tricks they're used to, the characters are complete each other, and I was speechless by the last trick, what I think is completely different, amazing!. I though this is the best film I saw in the last 6 months, and I hope there will be a sequel, or a prequel about The Four Horsemen's backgrounds.

I never expect the Now You See Me movies to be so excellent, but this has taken a place as one of my favorite movies of all time. The cast is unbeatable, the special effects/editing/cinematography are intriguing, and there are plenty of plot twists. I can never figure out the techniques behind the magic tricks so I love how this movie surprises me so much. Definitely go see this movie! And see it in the theaters if possible, because the big screen makes the whole experience so amazing. Also, random, but the soundtrack to this movie is spot-on. It's modern, upbeat, and sexy with a few great Chinese pop songs. Definitely a must-see!",Now You See Me 2

I certainly enjoyed it, but didn't think it to be one of my favorite movies of all time.NYSM2, however, is even more well done and absolutely enrapturing. I saw it twice, and I have to say, the second time was even better than the first. Although visual effects (added in post) are certainly used in the film, the many feats of ""magic"" are most definitely real.

354,samsam-32663,What a Macau citizen thinks about the movie,5,24 June 2016,"Being a citizen of Macau, I think the appearance of Macau in the movie is a total mess. I don't know whether foreigners think that China is still a place which is stuck in the past century or something. Who would wear silk dresses and watch a b/w television nowadays? Besides I don't think shops in the style of that magic shop would exist and there is no such place called ""Taipa Market"". In addition I can't understand why the film makers made Macau a place filled with gangsters and ""barbarians""... Macau is a friendly city where tourists are given good service.I think most of the movie is acceptable but like the first movie, the ending ruins the whole thing. Even though the effects are quite awesome, the plot of the movie bored me(too many useless scenes). I think what the audience want to see is how great the four horsemen are and the unique way they steal with magic, but not seeing them fail their acts. What I see in movie 2 is four kids throwing cards around while their guardian was watching, therefore I think Movie 1 is way better than the second.",Now You See Me 2
355,sashankssridhar,Huge Disappointment,4,4 July 2016,"When I stepped in to watch Now You See Me 2, the scenes of the first movie was riveting in my mind.But this film proved to be a HUGE disappointment. It was as if it had caved under the weight of its predecessor. The plot continuously loses grip. One is left questioning ""what? I don't get it"". Trust me the tricks seem more realistic than the plot. Too many so called twists in the tale. Well its not needed. The movie doesn't remain true to its genre. And characterization. Whoa! Talent seems wasted. Jesse Eisenberg deserved more screen space. Instead Daniel Radcliffe - great actor he may be- cant save a sinking plot. And Woody Harrelson in two roles. Not good. Lizzy Chaplan tries to impress us with her humor.Well it just didn't click. Morgan Freeman excellent as ever. But again not enough screen space. Reserving the best for the last, Mark Ruffalo. He seemed well and truly into the character. He sells his role to us. But the plot collapses. None of the greats in the movie could save it and thats a shame. All i could think when I stepped out was ""why oh why take a sequel. Couldn't we just float in the magic of the first part"".",Now You See Me 2
356,fromthevault,Slide of hand or booed off the stage?,7,5 July 2016,"The Four Horsemen come back into the light to take on their biggest challenge yet. But are they able to succeed the brilliantly over-complicated Now You See Me or would their second act disappoint, Join Film an TV Nerd to find out.2013's Now You See Me was entertaining nonsense, and the sequel is pretty much the same deal.So the short version of this review is that if you liked the first film then this one will probably work just as well for you. On the other hand it's unlikely to convert and newcomers - but maybe that's not a problem given the box office return the first time around.There's a lot of razzle and dazzle in the film, courtesy of new director Jon M. Chu (Step Up 3D, GI Joe 2), which makes perfect sense for a story about magicians who steal things during spectacular stunts.The set pieces are enjoyable enough, with some over the top card skills a particular highlight. Some vehicular action is a little dull but otherwise this is a handsome production which amps up the silliness to keep things moving at a brisk pace.Script wise it's not bad, but pretty much this is oceans eleven with added magic tricks. Whilst trying to have continuity in the form of agent Rhodes childhood and even an odd appearance by an ""Evil Twin"" Brother, this continues the story on 18 months after the events of the first film whilst adding a bit of a back story at the same time.In terms of new additions, Lizzy Caplan definitely makes an impression but her motor mouthing mostly annoyed me. She like a yapping puppy who doesn't know when to stop, seeking all the attention even though she doesn't really add that much besides some diversity to the group. Then there's Daniel Radcliffe who is mostly entertaining as villain but looks oddly ill throughout the film.Jesse Eisenberg , Mark Ruffalo , Woody Harrelson , Dave Franco , Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all return to reprise their respected roles and do a decent job of it.Of course there are various twists through out, but this time around your not really left with that sense of wonder of how did they pull it all off. Saying that this is still a fun film that continues the tale of the modern day robin hoods as they become part of the fabled ""eye"".The action takes place mainly away from the sates where the horsemen are all wanted by the FBI, as we visit the far east and the landmarks of London. The sets are over-elaborate and well polished as well they should be for this style of film, its just a shame that fight scenes fall victim the shaky cam is shaky curse making it even harder to see the tricks taking place.But overall few fun tricks, some famous faces and a fittingly over the top finale make Now You See Me 2 a very familiar two hours at the cinema. It's a little long and a bit basic but entertaining enough while it lasts So out of a possible five stars Now you see me 2 earns: ✪✪✪ It seems very realistic to What did you think of this film?

I'm pleased to say that I need not have worried, and I enjoyed this film just as much as the first - and possibly more; some of the illusions were worth the entrance in themselves. I liked seeing more of the characters and some depth develop to them, and unlikely as it might be, I'd certainly be up for watching a third outing. I say this as someone who doesn't necessarily enjoy magic on TV, and the difference here was probably the engaging cast. Dave Franco was a very pleasant surprise - endearing but not too cocky - and Mark Ruffalo manages to take centre stage and be self-effacing all at the same time. Big thumbs up.",Now You See Me 2

All of the tricks really got me and long after the movie my boyfriend and I still were talking about what we thought about every trick in the movie. Honestly, go watch it for yourself. I don't understand where the bad ratings are coming from.

360,abhishek-79650,"""Amazing"" factor missing",6,7 August 2016,"""The more you look, the less you see"" This quote in the the movie ""Now You See Me"", aptly describes it's sequel ""Now You See Me-2"". Now You See Me-2 is a silly, goofy and fun sequel to a silly, goofy and fun thriller which resolves around the world of magic and illusions. It's that kind of movie where every time your mind is trying to find the secret within the quick-moving story line. The casts, director and screenwriters have tried something weird and funky. One special thing about this movie is that Woody Harrelson gets to play his original character, Merritt McKinney, who is a renowned magician and hypnotist and uses his tricks and powers to pull off some brilliant crimes. Things make sense until the halfway point of the movie before all the trilling but illogical sequence of scene starts unfolding. Anyone watching this movie without having seen the first movie of the series(Now You See Me) would probably be lost more than once. The universe created in this movie is more than comically cartoonish and surreal. Coming to the plot, the person making things difficult for the Horsemen in the movie this time is Walter Mabry(Daniel Radcliffe), a wealthy businessman who once partnered with the target of horsemen in the previous movie. Due to this, the money that horsemen stole sort of belonged to him, and now he is seeking reparations. Mabry's role is of a man with double, triple... dose of devilish ego. Also, one amongst the new cast who are a part of this movie is Lizzy Caplan, who replaces original star Isla Fisher. If you do have have a good memory, then anything which you might remember from the movie after some weeks of watching it is it's benchmark-Gimmick, a cleverly staged ""sleight of hand"" trick that involves stealing a microchip hidden in a playing card. But still, this movie offers as much entertainment as it is expected to.",Now You See Me 2
361,jgarrett-45297,Not as good as the first one but wasn't terrible,6,20 August 2016,"The tricks in the first one were much better in my opinion and I honestly felt like there were more in the first one as well. In the second one, why did Woody Harrelson have to play a twin? The whole evil twin thing was not needed. Surely there could have been another actor playing a different relative. I didn't like seeing Woody talking with (basically) himself.One thing that really bothered me and made me not like it as much was the fact that James Franco's character was in 2 places at once. Let me explain. So, near the end of the movie, when The Four Horsemen were ""setting up"" their finale, Jack Wilder was performing the Queen trick (his first location). Then it goes to the evil twin finding and walking with Merritt McKinney. Merritt then calls Dylan Rhodes to warn him and the others that Walter and his father are on to where their next location will be. You don't find out until they start describing how the trick was done that Jack Wilder was also at this brotherly encounter (location 2). Jack was the one who hypnotized the evil twin and told him to throw them out of the plane. After Merritt calls Dylan, then Jack, Lula, and Atlas abandon their tricks. So how was Jack able to perform a trick in one location and then hypnotize someone in another location? I know they were magicians, but even magicians can't really be in two locations at once.",Now You See Me 2

Naturally, we thought the sequel would live up to it's name. Boy were we ever so wrong. 20 minutes in, and I felt that this was not going to be anything interesting. No one is in character. Lula is dull and annoying, we have no idea what happened to Henley apart from the fact that she left and Atlas is bitter about it, Jack well he's just nice to look at in this movie, and two Woody Harrelson's is, well, too damn much. This movie had so much potential, but it seeped through the plot holes. Not only did it lack magic acts like it had in the first one, but at some point I asked myself ""What is this about again?"" SO MUCH POTENTIAL JUST WENT OUT THE WINDOW ALRIGHT? Acting on point, but you can't do anything if the writers don't deliver. Such disappointment, and I really don't understand how this movie is rated almost 7 stars.

Don't expect everything to make sense, because of course, most of it is actually silly but still fun nonetheless. Mark Ruffalo is always a delight to watch and the rest of the cast make a great team as well. Don't expect a super smart plot, just a typical fast paced film that will keep you on your toes.

I hope it isn't considered a spoiler to tell you... he is not playing Harry Potter in this.Morgan Freeman is a legend, as per usual and plays his role brilliantly.

The twists and turns that finally led to the dramatic finale was absolutely dazzling and unexpected. I think that it's astounding the director's ability to trick us and misdirect us, so you're never entirely sure what has happened until everything is explained. The special effects were absolutely stunning and the use of real life magic sequences fit perfectly. The use of contemporary music mix with popular songs on the film's soundtrack was also well thought out and it took the film to the next level.

Really?
Remember,if you can understand magic, then there is nothing like magic.
This is what this movie is about.BTW there is explanations for twists in this movie but who needs explanation for magic.If they tell you how they were performing those tricks,there will nothing remain like magic.
For Example,in action movies like Fast and Furious Series,there is not explanations for those impossible stunts like how a car can fly?Moreover Now you see me seires is all about magic.They are saying that they are showing magic.If people can easily umderstand their tricks,the purpose of movie would collapse.
So these points in these reviews are baseless.
Its like to watch harry potter and ask how they were performing magic.
Its against the definition of magic that you can understand it.
Come to the acting,almost all the cast is experienced and i found no issue with that.But i should say that the speed of the events occuring in the movie is bit high.Pace could be bit slow.Also i found some comments which were saying that this movie was looking all about tricks.
No it was not looking all about tricks it was really all about tricks.
It was a movie based on magical tricks.The difference was they give you story and yeah there is story which is also mgical.
In the end it was entertaining movie!
Note:Before watching this movie,you should make it clear in your mind that you're going to watch magic and after watching agian you shoud recall that you've watched magic!
Then there will be no questions in your mind like how those tricks were performed and you will find this movie entertaining!",Now You See Me 2

Looking for something fast-paced, fun, with amazing actors?This movie has it all.About a year and a half after successfully outsmarting the FBI, the remaining of the Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson) have concealed themselves from the public of New York City accompanied by a new addition to the team: Lula (Lizzy Caplan).However, during a comeback act, the Four Horsemen somehow manage to wind up in Macau, China, where the greater part of the movie takes place; and where I believe the best scene occurs.My favourite scene, which is famously known as the card scene, happens as the Horsemen carry out their cunning plan after having been instructed to steal a computer chip for a criminal named Walter Mabry (acted exceptionally by Daniel Radcliffe).This action-filled scene is guaranteed to make your heart race, as the Horsemen attempt to sneak the chip out of a Science Centre. Practically-done tricks combined with CGI makes for a spectacular scene. The mise-en-scene captures tension with the soundtrack, acting, and camera shots that follow the card as it's being flicked back and forth between them. Wide-eyes and nervous jokes made by the Horsemen are what add character to the scene. Especially when it feels as if you've stepped into their shoes.Suspense rings throughout this entire movie.
