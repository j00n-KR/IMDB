0,TheLittleSongbird,Who would know that a purposely old-fashioned story could be a basis for a film that is so much fun?,9,3 September 2010,"I certainly wouldn't call Romancing the Stone the best adventure film ever or anything, but it is a truly entertaining and fun one at that. The story is admittedly old-fashioned(and I think purposefully so) but the freshness of the material more than compensates. The gags are very tongue-in-cheek, there are some very clever touches in the writing and the action is breathless. The film is great to watch, there is a terrific score and the direction is fine. Michael Douglas is quite world-weary here and his character is nothing special but he also has a lot of charm about his performance, while Danny DeVito is great fun as the inept kidnapper. But it is Kathaleen Turner's movie, she dazzles in the role, and her chemistry with Douglas is in general very good. In conclusion, a lot of fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Romancing the Stone
1,bkoganbing,The kind of thing she writes about,7,5 May 2017,"When a version of a female Walter Mitty is ever done no doubt about it that Kathleen Turner should get first call. Unless you think she kind of did it already with Romancing The Stone.Turner is a romance novelist by profession who in real life is a rather humdrum sort prone to accidents. But a piece of mail from her sister who is in Colombia with a map to a rather large emerald, the Hitchcockian McGuffin of the film leads her on a high road to adventure the kind of thing she writes about. Her adventure in Colombia includes taking the wrong bus, being chased by a free wheeling army colonel, falling in the hands of drug dealers, pursued by bottom feeding crook Danny DeVito and finally partnering with the kind of adventure hero she writes about in Michael Douglas.Douglas and Turner would prove so popular that they did two other pictures in the 80s. The film itself got an Oscar nod for Editing.Some others in this gifted cast are Mary Ellen Trainor as her sister, Holland Taylor as Turner's editor, Alfonso Arau who is a drug dealer fan of her work, and Manuel Ojeda as the army colonel obsessed with that big green jewel.Romancing The Stone is a lushly photographed and vigorous satire on all those old action/adventure films. You know, the stuff you only see in romance novels.",Romancing the Stone
2,Leofwine_draca,Light and forgettable globetrotting adventure romp,6,3 November 2016,"ROMANCING THE STONE is one of those big 1980s blockbuster movies that haven't dated very well as the years have gone by. For some reason, a lot of '80s films seem more dated than their counterparts that were made back in the 1950s. Still, this one is enjoyable enough if you're in a forgiving mood, even if it is a blatant rip off of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (and made without that film's wit, charisma, and style).The story enough is the tried-and-tested romantic-comedy-adventure template: a mismatched duo are on the run from a bunch of nefarious bad guys, who will stop at nothing to get the precious treasure map/jewel/secret treasure/etc. This film wins a lot of charm from the talents of a laid back Michael Douglas, at his charismatic best, and feisty Kathleen Turner, who turns out to be more than a match for the gung-ho hero. Essentially the plot sees them escaping from the bad guys in various South American countries, battling jungle flora and fauna as well as each other. Danny DeVito pops up for some comic relief and the bad guys are suitably sinister.Don't expect much from the script. Sparks fly from the Douglas and Turner characters but that's about it. There's a lot of contrivances and coincidences along the way which you have to take with a pinch of salt. There's nothing particular memorable or surprising here but as a light hearted romp it's fairly watchable and enjoyable.",Romancing the Stone
3,SnoopyStyle,Good chemistry,8,8 December 2013,"Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a scared New Yorker who writes extremely successful adventure romance novels. Her sister Elaine is kidnapped in Colombia, and is being held ransom for a treasure map. Joan got the map in the mail and must deliver it to Cartagena. She is hunted in Columbia by a corrupt cop, a scheming Ralph (Danny DeVito), and rescued by adventurer Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas).Director Robert Zemeckis has made a fun adventure romance. The romance novel writer gets a taste of her own writing. Kathleen Turner usually plays a tougher chick. She's quite endearing as the mousy writer. And she has great chemistry with Michael Douglas. It's funny that they would reunite with Danny DeVito in his 'The War of the Roses'. They have that combative chemistry. It's a fun 80s movie.",Romancing the Stone
4,Prismark10,Romancing the Stone,7,4 January 2020,"Robert Zemeckis ended up making an Indiana Jones type of adventure but set in the present day. The film's success enabled Steven Spielberg to allow Zemeckis to make Back to the Future.Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a successful but lonely New York writer of romance novels. When her sister is kidnapped in Colombia. Joan sets out to deliver a ransom which is a map she received in the mail.Once she arrives in Columbia, she is sent to the wrong place by a ruthless and corrupt military police colonel Zolo. When Joan finds herself in danger she is rescued by adventurer Jack T Colton (Michael Douglas) who discovers that the map leads to treasure.Both are being pursued by Zolo and the scheming Ralph (Danny DeVito) who along with his cousin kidnapped Joan's sister.The success of the film lies with Zemeckis's deft direction in making this comedy adventure film. Douglas also deserves credit, it was made by his production company and he pitches Colton just right. A roguish selfish adventurer with a hint of a good heart and romance. The rugged male lead that Wilder writers about.",Romancing the Stone
5,mark.waltz,One of the greats popcorn movies of all time.,8,29 July 2019,"I beg to differ when I hear Kathleen Turner saying that she never should have accepted the role of Joan Wilder. She is fantastic in this movie, and it is a pleasure to watch her go from mousy romance novelist to a woman who can handle herself surprisingly to everybody else in the jungles of Columbia. When she goes there to aide her kidnapped sister, she finds more than she bargained for thanks to her association with adventurer Michael Douglas who saves her from being robbed by the man responsible for her sister's kidnapping.Turner and Douglas fly down mud slides while she attempts to cross a faulty old bridge and swings the rest of the way across and later bleeds over a pit of hungry alligators. Douglas, initially annoyed by her seeming incompetence, quickly discovers that she learns quickly on her own, and just the dropping of her name alone saves them from being killed. Chasing them is the buffoonish Danny DeVito, working for a secret boss, and the exact kind of imbecile Douglas thought Turner was.This adventure comedy romance is a shear delight from start to finish, and shows why Turner dominated the 1980's as the most successful female movie star at the box office. It tops the same year's Indiana Jones sequel in thrills and is a much better movie without being gross or headache inducing. Turner's character makes a great turn around, and her character is quite the antithesis of ""Body Heat's"" Maddie Walker. This is the type of film that you can watch over and over and find new thrills each time. The terrific Holland Taylor adds her usual delicious snark as Turner's agent and confidante.",Romancing the Stone
6,classicsoncall,"""I've never been anybody's best time before.""",8,17 June 2006,"If I'm cruising the cable channels and this film is playing it's usually a given that I'll pick it up midstream and stay for the rest of the ride. ""Romancing The Stone"" has just the right mix of action, adventure and comedy to make it one of the most watchable and entertaining films ever.The first real hook in the film occurs with that downhill mud slide, just brilliant! I'd pay good money at any amusement park to take a ride just like that. At that point the relationship between romance novelist Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) and bird trapper Jack Colton (Michael Douglas) is just getting under way, and the early going is ripe with great one liners fired off by Colton - ""That's not a bridge, it's pre-Colombian art"".That's not to say Danny DeVito doesn't get his share of sight and sound gags in as well. His character is an inept henchman loosely modeled on the Louie De Palma persona in ""Taxi"". He plays off cousin Ira (Zack Norman) who has an affinity for alligators which he calls 'snappers'.The surprise performance for me though is the one put in by Kathleen Turner. All of her scenes, from the ransacked New York apartment to the Colombian vine swing, the wrecked plane pot fest and the Cartagena dance with Colton, each is played with just the right emotion and facial nuance that shows a great range of expression.The frosting on the cake is when Colton shows up in New York wearing the alligator boots. I think that makes an even bigger impression than the yacht when one considers how he got them; that was just the right touch to cap the film.With a rather large voting fan base for the movie on this site, I'm surprised it only comes in at a 6.8 as of the time of this posting. No matter, if you like the film, the rating isn't that important. It's a fun ride with principals Douglas, Turner and DeVito that doesn't wear out it's welcome with repeat viewings.",Romancing the Stone
7,jboothmillard,Romancing the Stone,10,7 January 2008,"From director Robert Zemeckis, this is a fantastic adventure with a great jungle treasure hunt and some great tongue-in-cheek gags along the way. Basically Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a romance novelist, and one day receives a treasure map from his recently murdered brother-in-law, she also finds out her sister Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor) and taken to Colombia, and the villains she go there to exchange the map for her sister. She gets there alright, but she finds herself stranded in the jungles, but she finds help with soldier-of-fortune Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas, also producing) who agrees to bring her back to civilisation. Soon enough the villains start coming after them, and Jack now also has to deal with that, i.e. killing them and rescuing Joan. These villains include Ralph (Danny DeVito) and Ira (Zack Norman) who are determined to get that map, with hardly any concern for the ransom exchange. Soon enough Joan and Jack know that if they get to the treasure on the map first, the villains will have nothing to look for, but Ralph is on to them with that plan. Also starring Alfonso Arau as Juan, Manuel Ojeda as Zolo, Holland Taylor as Gloria, Eve Smith as Mrs. Irwin, Joe Nesnow as Super and José Chávez as Santos. The action you can't take your eyes off of, the stars all have their great giggly moments, this is just great fun (Indiana Jones, eat your heart out)! A sequel, The Jewel of the Nile, followed in 1985. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Michael Douglas was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Outstanding!",Romancing the Stone
8,rmax304823,Por el dinero salta el perro.,7,13 February 2010,"Michael Douglas is Jack Colton. Colton -- now, there's a real whitebread name for you, ready to be rolled up into a tiny ball of sodium propionate. Could be one of those family series that were so popular on television -- ""The Coltons."" But it's tempered with the first name, Jack. Just imagine if it had been something else, almost anything else. Chester Colton. Whitney Colton. Montmorency Colton. But no. No one named Jack Anything can be other than one-hundred percent red-blooded testosterone-busting adventurer.And so he is. Katherine Turner, on the other hand, is an eremetic New Yorker who writes romance novels. She is, as they say, unattached because she's still waiting to meet someone like the masculine hero of her books.She receives a letter from a gang of thugs in Colombia. They are holding her sister hostage. They will give her up when she, Turner, delivers a treasure map to them. The treasure map has something to do with a giant emerald. So she flies at once with the map to Colombia, gets lost, and is rescued by the heroic Jack T. Colton, who looks exactly like both the hero of her romances and like Michael Douglas.There follows a wild ride through the jungles and corrupt fortresses of Colombia, a fashionable target at the time because of the drug cartels. (Today it would probably be Venezuela.) They are tracked and hectored by Danny DeVito and his cousin, who are in on the whole deal.It's not worth spelling out the plot, I guess. It's one impossible escape from danger after another impossible escape from danger. Let's see. First, just after Douglas and Turner meet, they slide down a hill of mud in a pouring rain and splash into a puddle, and Douglas winds up with his face buried between Turner's abducted legs. Then they are shot at by the thugs. Then they swing on vines across a high chasm over a plunging river. Then they hack their way through the jungle. Then they stumble upon the old wreck of a drug smuggler's airplane and make a fire out of the marijuana and get high. Then -- I forget. I get mixed up. And all the way through these labors, Turner fumes with indignation (except when she's screaming) and Douglas is making wisecracks, some of which carry with them the slight taste of Angst. At the end, they both die tragic deaths and the thugs get the emerald and walk away sneering. Just kidding.Douglas is pretty good as the imitation Indiana Jones, although he is by no means an Arnold Schwarzenegger, who would simply have wrenched off the head of anyone who stood in his way. He's not Burt Lancaster either. Lancaster would have done a back flip and disappeared when cornered. Kathleen Turner is properly breathless and wide-eyed. Danny DeVito contributes some laughs. In a police station, with his ""Wanted"" poster on the wall next to him, he's forced to make a phone call to his gangster cousin and tries to disguise himself and the purpose of his call. ""Hello, Ma? It's me, Irving. . . Calm down, Ma. . . . Who SAYS I never call?"" I don't know why but for some reason that line always cracks me up.It's funny because it's so desperately unbelievable. The head honcho, the capo, of the thugs catches the monstrous emerald in his hand. A crocodile snaps his jaws up and chomps off the hood's hand. Mind you, this is even worse than slitting your wrists. But the hood manages to let out only some kind of horrible MOAN, then wraps his bloody stump in a handkerchief and carries on, cranky, as if with a hangnail.Probably the equal, or nearly so, of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" without the moral message or the sublime artistry of the original.",Romancing the Stone

10,BA_Harrison,"Romancing the Ark. Raiders of the Lost Stone. Aww heck, it's got Kathleen in it, and that's good enough for me!",8,17 April 2011,"Romancing the Stone is one of many action/adventure films that followed in the wake of Raiders of the Lost Ark; from Michael Douglas's rough and ready hero, who looks like the only raiding he's been doing is of Harrison Ford's wardrobe, to the regular action set-pieces, the influence of Spielberg's mega-successful blockbuster is plain to see (as is the lower budget, unfortunately).But although Romancing the Stone occasionally comes across as 'Raiders-lite', lacking that film's relentless verve and spectacular special effects, it does possess a unique charm all of its own thanks to a witty screenplay blessed with genuine heart (or should that be 'genuine corazon'?), and an incredible on-screen chemistry between stars Douglas and Kathleen Turner (something that is sorely missing in many a modern adventure movie).Being an avid Kathleen Turner fan ever since seeing her all sweaty and nekkid in Body Heat, I could be accused of bias, but I rate Romancing the Stone 8/10— its a fun slice of good old-fashioned escapist action (one that just happens to benefit from the gradual transformation of Turner from plain-Joan to sizzling sex bomb).",Romancing the Stone
11,blanche-2,Fun and laughs in the jungle,7,21 August 2010,"Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are ""Romancing the Stone"" in this 1984 adventure film, well-directed by Robert Zemeckis.Turner plays romance author Joan Wilder, who in order to ransom her sister Elaine, flies to Colombia to deliver a map sent to her by her late brother-in-law. Joan soon gets involved in a bizarre situation better than anything she's ever written. She gets on the wrong bus and soon meets Jack (Michael Douglas), an adventurer who lives by his wits. He agrees to get her out of the jungle for $375 in travelers checks, as long as they're American Express. Because Joan has the map, several factions are after her, including Ralph (Danny DeVito) and lots more scary people. Jack talks Joan into going after the treasure themselves to give her more of a bargaining chip.This is a very fun film, with lively performances by Douglas, Turner, DeVito and the rest of the cast. Many funny and suspenseful moments, including Joan being recognized and feted by a Colombian drug dealer, a Tarzan-like swing across a river, and problems with alligators. Not to mention a little romance along the way for Joan and Jack.Highly enjoyable, very satisfying film with the two stars working very well together.",Romancing the Stone
12,JohnHowardReid,"Good script, great cast, terrific locations!",8,23 August 2014,"Because I'm a keen photographer myself, I always like to see a movie that's captivatingly photographed. And by ""captivating"" I mean both technically perfect yet artistically balanced and composed. For that reason, I usually avoid movies directed by people like Abner Biberman, Jesse Hibbs and Robert Zemeckis who have no sense of composition. On some occasions, of course, a director who flunks the composition test could be assigned a photographer who does the work himself and whom the director is smart enough to use without any interference or ""suggestions"". The photographer supervises the lighting and lines up the shot, while the director contents himself with browbeating the cast or making his producer happy by keeping both his eyes firmly on the clock. Recently, I purchased a Fox video cassette of Romancing the Stone and I enjoyed it very much. I didn't notice even a single composition that seemed to be cropped and that didn't fit snugly on my old 4x3 TV. So I'm glad I didn't see this movie in a cinema. I would have run screaming out of the theatre before the very first scene was even a quarter over, thanks to Mr. Zemeckis' habit of lining up close-up after close-up of Kathleen Turner with presumably a superabundance of ugly blank space on either side of her face! Mind you, the movie will gain no kudos south of the border, but on its own romance/thriller level it's quite involving and exciting. And Mr. Zemeckis does make thrilling use his many south- of-the-border locations. My only quarrel is that Danny De Vito's role is so small, but you can't have everything, and at 101 minutes, the movie was just the right length to retain interest almost from first (the movie does take a while to build up) and certainly until last.",Romancing the Stone

14,hitchcockthelegend,You're a man who takes money from stranded women!,8,7 January 2013,"Romancing the Stone is directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Diane Thomas. It stars Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, Danny De Vito, Zack Norman, Alfonso Arau, Manuel Ojeda and Holland Taylor. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Dean Cundey.Joan Wilder (Turner) is a lonely romance novelist in New York who receives a treasure map in the post. Not long after she receives a phone call from kidnappers in Cartagena, Columbia, requesting the map in exchange for her sister. Upon arriving in Cartagena, things quickly go wrong and Joan finds herself paying for the help of grizzled American Jack T. Colton, a man who looks like one of Joan's novel creations; but certainly doesn't act like one. The couple, however, need to get on because there are others after the map...Holding up surprisingly well on a revisit these days, well except for Colton's white dance attire that is, Zemeckis' romantic adventure is one of the most telling and fun films of its type to follow in the slipstream of Indiana Jones.Everything works here, from the screenplay that is infused with mud- slides, grumpy banter, bandit dodging, water peril, snakes, treasure, gun fights, colourful villains and crocodile wrestling! To likable stars who would go on to make quite an impact on cinema, it's a film that doesn't lack for exciting genre staples.Douglas and Turner would work so well together a sequel would follow in 1985 and they would also make The War of the Roses for Danny De Vito in 1989. It's this pairing that drives the movie forward, where given a sharp screenplay to work from, written by Diane Thomas in the late 70s, the pair spark as the twists and turns send both their respective characters on an adventure of discovery of both mind and body.It can be viewed as a safe formula now, but just how many films of similar ilk get it right? This is fun, often exciting and sexy into the bargain as well, yep, still a treat after all these years. 7.5/10",Romancing the Stone
15,Scarecrow-88,Romancing the Stone,7,11 December 2009,"I had read somewhere that it was rumored that Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner were having a passionate affair while they were making Romancing the Stone, and I must admit that I thought about Mr. and Mrs. Smith as I was watching it because the leads generate serious chemistry, the sparks are visible in all their scenes together.The movie is a fast-moving, charming romantic adventure that allows the viewer to go along for the ride without worrying with any kind of major story-line to get in the way. It's about a lonely, but beautiful, romance novelist who must return a treasure map to Columbia, in exchange for her sister's safety. Her sister's husband had been murdered and she kidnapped over a map which leads to a priceless stone. Joan Wilder(Turner)flies to Columbia, is sent towards the wrong direction by a violent revolutionary, Zolo(Manuel Ojeda), where she meets up with a rugged loner, Jack T Colton(Douglas)when the bus she was riding crashes into his jeep. On foot, fleeing Zolo's soldiers, Jack and Joan must evade death or capture in order to save Elaine's life. Elaine, Joan's sister, is played by director Zemekis' then-wife Mary Ellen Trainor. Also in pursuit of the map is the kidnapper's cousin, Ralph(Danny DeVito, an inspired bit of casting). Plus, Jack and Joan make the decision to seek out the priceless stone, using is as a bargaining chip(..or so they plan, but of course other factors prevent this from going as smoothly as they'd like).Essentially, the movie is about two people falling hard for each other as they move through Columbian jungles, fleeing gunfire and certain death. It's fluff, really, an exciting way to spend 90 minutes. It's no wonder the movie was a blockbuster because the leads all turn in entertaining performances and there's plenty of stunts and nicely orchestrated action sequences(..such as a rope swing from one side of a mountain to another, a lengthly mud slide, and a jump from a vehicle into a river). Romancing the Stone is popcorn fodder that goes down nicely and doesn't hurt. This was a wonderful period for Kathleen Turner, she was sexy and had a presence many actresses could die for. I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with her while watching this movie. Douglas is rarely as likable as he is here.",Romancing the Stone

Also Douglas (a good actor) is totally wrong for the he man role here. He is masculine and all but seriously--Douglas as a he-man??? Come on!!! Still this film works. It moves quickly and has a fast and funny script. Not all the lines work but the majority do. Plenty of action too and a seriously explicit (for a PG movie) sex scene between Turner and Douglas. But what really drives this picture is Turner's acting. She's just GREAT in her role! You see her character change in a totally believable manner throughout the film. Also when she totally changes at the end she's incredibly beautiful. This is all totally predictable but it's a lot of fun. The studio thought this would bomb when it came out but it became a surprise hit. There's a so-so sequel called ""Jewel of the Nile""--but stick with this one. A 9 all the way.",Romancing the Stone

In Romancing the Stone, his character has a romantic dance with Joan (Kathleen Turner) and then the next scene cuts to them in a post-coital scene. Several years later Michael helms Fatal Attraction, and the dance scene proceeds the frenzied sex scene with Alex (Glenn Close). Then in 1993's Basic Instinct his character engages in a lustful dance with Catherine Tramell in a night club as an entree to an incredibly lustful and combative sex scene on Tramell's large bed.

21,Mr-Fusion,Guaranteed to please,7,4 June 2014,"To me, ""Romancing the Stone""'s greatest asset is in striking just the right mix of chick-flick and adventure movie. And Kathleen Turner's an empowered part of the chase, not just a meek romance novelist. Not many movies can do this balancing act as deftly (at least of those that I've seen) and that's a real feat.Outside of that, this is really just a good time all around; great cast, memorable characters and a good story - all set to an adult contempo score (which, despite how it sounds, seems to pair with this movie quite nicely). Michael Douglas is at his most likable and Alfonso Arau steals every second of his meager screen time; everything just comes together with this.Simply put, it's a lot of fun.7/10",Romancing the Stone
22,siderite,Loved it once,8,27 July 2021,"As an 80's movie it was a huge hit. I remember watching the bootlegged version and enjoying the hell out of it. I must have been 10 or something at the time. Watching it in 2021 was a different experience. It was still fun and it could still partially transport me to the emotional space that I had back then, but it has not aged well. There are obvious plot holes, bad acting, ridiculous premises and the budget for a planned flop (which is why Zemeckis was attached to it in the first place). Yet somehow it still expresses something that is hard to find in modern cinema: fun! You could see that the actors had fun, even acting in drenching clothes in some jungle set and having creative differences with the director.Fun fact: I watched this immediately after I finished watching The Kominsky Method, also featuring Douglas and Turner. It's a strange feeling to see the same people at different ages at the same time.Bottom line: If it would have been made in 2020 it would have been a terrible film, perhaps even offensive to some. For a 1984 romance that no one thought was worth anything, it was pretty good.",Romancing the Stone

I just adore this movie, ever since I was a little girl I just wanted to live this movie. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas had this amazing chemistry that made you wonder how the heck they were not a real couple in life. Though like Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, their friendship shows so well on screen as well as off that you're grateful they could bounce off each other so well. Romancing the Stone is such a fun film that shows off DeVito, Turner and Douglas' talent so well that we saw them all again in War of the Roses. Romancing came first though and what a great movie.Joan Wilder is a lonely New York romance novelist who receives a treasure map mailed to her by sister, Elaine who calls Joan and begs her to come to Cartagena, Colombia, because Elaine has been kidnapped by bumbling antiquities smugglers Ira and Ralph, and the map is to be the ransom. Hastily flying to Colombia, Joan is detoured from the rendezvous with Ralph by Colonel Zolo, the man who killed Elaine's husband. Joan ends up in the jungle and is almost killed by Zolo, but is saved by the swashbuckling American exporter Jack T. Colton. For getting her to Cartagena, Joan promises to pay Jack for getting her to Cartagena so she can save her sister. But she ends up living one of her romance novels as her and Jack grow closer as they discover the map holds a stone that they will romance.Romancing the Stone is a perfect mixture of adventure, romance and humor. It is literally like a romance novel, but one that even the guys could get into. I really like how Kathleen's character Joan goes from this anti-social caterpillar into a woman of the world by the end. It had such a great story arch for her. Michael Douglas as Jack, couldn't have been a more perfect choice, like his daddy, he reminds me of one of those old Hollywood actors who has been doing it for years. He's handsome, charismatic, funny and strong, so perfect for the role. Danny DeVito was so funny, I nearly died laughing when his cousin was leaving him to take the fall and Danny screams ""When will you come back"" his cousin screams ""Soon!"" he asks ""How soon?!"" and the cousin replies with ""very soon!"", how sweet to do that to your family, right? The villains are great and very scary. Everything about this film is just a ton of fun, I guarantee there will be something that you can connect with in this film. Wither it's the action, the romance or the humor, Romancing the Stone is a film not to be missed.9/10",Romancing the Stone
25,MovieAddict2016,"A fun, ""Indiana Jones""-style adventure movie",7,26 October 2005,"Robert Zemeckis managed to find investors for ""Back to the Future"" due to the success of ""Romancing the Stone"" in 1984. In fact, he turned down an offer to direct the sequel (1985's disappointing ""Jewel of the Nile"") so that he could instead film ""...Future."" On the BttF DVD, he seems to speak quite highly of ""Romancing the Stone,"" and I agree with the critics and him - it's a fun movie. Not great, but entertaining.Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner form a great pair (they've worked together a few times over the years, my favorite collaboration of theirs being ""War of the Roses"" in 1989). Their constant bickering is funny and they definitely have chemistry.Danny DeVito (who directed ""Roses,"" incidentally) co-stars and handles the short, funny comedic relief role quite well - he returned for the sequel as well, but in this one he actually seems to make sense (whereas in ""Nile"" he didn't seem to serve much of a purpose).If you enjoyed the ""Indiana Jones"" series or any other serial adventure-style movies, you'll love ""Romancing the Stone.""",Romancing the Stone

It's a harmless, fun and funny adventure that stood on its own. (For the opposite of these statements, look no further than the movie's own sequel, The Jewel of the Nile.)I vaguely, and I mean maybe I really didn't, remember seeing this many years (or decades) ago. So, this viewing appeared fresh to me, and I don't regret it. It was charming, incredibly set in the 80s flick and I had fun with the main characters.While not groundbreaking, even for the 1980s, it's a good throwback for those of us who love movies made with heart and not the CGI of today. If you have seen it and liked it, it's a nice revisit to the good old days. If not, no harm can be done from seeing a movie not restricted by some offended audiences of today.",Romancing the Stone

Through an unfortunate series of events, Wilder ends up lost in the jungle and pins her hopes for survival on an exotic bird smuggler names Jack T Colton (Michael Douglas). Is Colton the dreamy hero of Wilder's books or is he also in it for himself and after the treasure? If I were to use only one word to describe Romancing the Stone, it would be ""fun"". This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was lucky enough to catch it in the theater way back in 1984. It was fun then and it's just as fun now. I've probably seen it a dozen or more times since 1984. Adventure, comedy, romance, danger, action – Romancing the Stone's got it all. There's a lot here to like. Robert Zemeckis' direction is spot-on. His pacing is near-flawless. The cinematography is often stunning. The jungles of Columbia are beautifully shot. Green never looked so good. While the actual hunt for the treasure doesn't play as big a role as I would prefer, it's clever and enjoyable. The movie also features some terrific acting from Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas, Danny DeVito, and the scene stealing Alfonso Arau.

29,bowmanblue,Big hair and bigger snakes,8,19 January 2018,"Someone told me that 'Romancing the Stone' was actually a romantic comedy, rather than an action movie. Yeah, I guess there's an element of 'romance' in as much as the two lead characters are male and female, therefore if you even know what a 'film' is you'll realise there's going to be an element of two people getting together in the midst of an outlandish adventure. However, I still always see this film as an 'action' movie, rather than luvvy-duvvy stuff!A writer (Kathleen Turner) finds her sister has been kidnapped in a South American country and sets off to rescue her (or rather just pay the desired ransom). Once in the jungle territory she finds herself woefully out of her depth, but luckily she seems to bump into the only other American in the continent (Michael Douglas) who is skilled in the ways of jungle survival. I can't quite recall which came first - this, or 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Either way, they seem to co-exist in the same universe when it comes to tones (although Temple of Doom strays into the supernatural, as opposed to a drugs cartel, but for the early part of the film they're near identical in terms of tone). Not just do our bickering heroes have each other and the terrain they're stranded in, they also have Danny DeVito's slimy little character hot on their heels, not to mention a tonne of drug lords and, of course, the kidnappers. So there's plenty of time for conflict to come into play here. Personally, I think the film has stood up to the tests of time in terms of action and entertainment. There's clearly plenty of chemistry between the two leads and the film's a lot of fun. However, you can tell it was filmed in the eighties (not just by Douglas' 'mullet') due to how the woman is basically portrayed as a 'damsel in distress' type character and the man is clearly in charge at all times. Then you also have the stereotypical South American characters who are all shady (at best!) or simply drug dealers. If you can get over the fact that this was just how films were made thirty years ago then you should find this a fun film to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon (and make sure you see the 'full' version rather than the one that's been 'cut for TV' as it contains a lot more 'croc action!').",Romancing the Stone

It moves at a frenetic pace, and much of the action is mindless, but it is quite entertaining. Turner is terrific, displaying the right combination of vulnerability and valor as she navigates obstacles in a foreign land. Douglas is pretty good as an adventurer not unlike Indiana Jones.

38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Zemeckis makes light-hearted romance adventure enjoyable for both sexes,6,8 September 2009,"Kathleen Turner stars as a romance adventure novelist who ends up on a romantic adventure of her own ""Romancing the Stone."" Naturally, fans of romance adventures will most enjoy this one, but to its credit there's a good balance of action to make this film enjoyable for just about everyone.""Romancing the Stone"" is a writer's fantasy about a writers' fantasy that comes true. Screenwriter Diane Thomas must've been something of a hopeless romantic herself to create Joan Wilder and have her live out a story similar to her books. Wilder is a single woman in her 30s living with her cat who finds out her sister has been kidnapped and that the ransom has been sent to her randomly in the form of a treasure map. Joan flies to Columbia where another man interested in the map sends her off into the jungle instead of straight to her destination where Indiana Jones more or less in the form of Michael Douglas as Jack Colton finds her and helps her begrudgingly.The film certainly capitalizes on the popularity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" only targeting itself at women. Joan is a naive and hopeless beauty-in-waiting and Douglas the rebellious adventurer who helps her for initially selfish reasons that turn into romantic ones. Their chemistry is a bit forced, but each fits perfectly into his/her role that we easily approve.From an action sense, director Robert Zemeckis, in his first major film, keeps the film light but suspenseful enough to keep our interest. Considering the writing calls for cat and mouse the entire time as Joan and Jack run from the corrupt the Colombian police officer Zolo and his men as well as Danny DeVito, a lot hinges on Zemeckis' creativity to keep the constantly recycling scenes of fleeing from gunfire feel more pressing each time until the climax. He also brings a healthy sense of humor that makes the movie easier to enjoy, knowing that even its maker wants this to be nothing but light-hearted entertainment.""Romancing"" is predictable adventure with even more predictable romance, but Zemeckis finds a way to make it inherently more likable than even Turner or Douglas as talents do. In a film where there would be plenty to role our eyes at, Zemeckis graciously spares us the trouble. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Romancing the Stone

It might not be as good as you think, but RTS is still a good and adventurous ride. I do love adventurous movies, one that really sprang to mind, was Bird On A Wire. Our two leads, in such likable performances, where Turner and Douglas have great chemistry, as well as their characters having great names, careers and talents. Turner is a famous novelist, Joan Wilder, where I reckon' Gene Wilder, was the inspiration for this name, Gene-Joan. Her sister is kidnapped, the late and sadly missed, (Traitor- Lethal Weapon's favorite psychiatrist) and held for Ransom in the jungles of Columbia. Turner must travel there, to locate a map, where a particularly beautifully shining lime emerald stone is, and you guessed it, Turner brings a lot of trouble, while teaming up for Douglas, a tracker, bounty hunter, at his most masculine. Devito's, one of the baddies, well a real idiot baddie, desperately after the map, kind of exists as an amusing antidote for this good adventure filled film, the gushing landslide, slipping scene I'll never forget, Douglas landing in the most uncompromising of positions. This is kind of Indiana Jones, M rated style, even featuring an unpredictable, bloody minus a half arm moment. I do remember when going to see Children Of The Corn, this was playing also, where a father payed for his two kid's tickets, and they must of only around ten. Performance wise, both deliver, where Turner a little better. RTS has a great happy ending too, the novelist selling her new factual story becoming, a best seller, a cliché, in movies to come.

Even if it's not a sequel, you know the story.The Goonies, Nate and Hayes, Jake Speed, Firewalker, Vibes, Big Trouble in Little China, Young Sherlock Holmes...and of course the crown, the king, the Indiana Jones movies.They are all close enough to one another to really fit into the same mold.

45,barnabyrudge,"Simple jungle adventure, easy to watch and thoroughly enjoyable despite minor flaws.",6,30 April 2007,"Robert Zemeckis serves up an enjoyable, if derivative, South American adventure with Romancing The Stone. The main positive to emerge from the film is the on-screen chemistry between stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. They remind one of the old-fashioned tradition of a hero and heroine who bicker their way through an entire movie, while we in the audience know that secretly they're in love with each other. Perhaps the main drawback with the film is the curiously bloodthirsty climax which seems out of keeping with the old-fashioned tone established in the rest of the film.Shy lady novelist Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner), a hopeless romantic, receives a package from Colombia. Shortly afterwards she discovers that her sister Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor) has been kidnapped in Colombia and Elaine's husband has been murdered. Seems that someone is particularly keen to get hold of whatever is in the package, and Joan must personally take it to South America if she wants her sister to be freed. From the minute she arrives, Joan is sucked into a world of danger and sudden death. But - like a mysterious hero from one of her many novels - a handsome soldier of fortune, Jack Colton (Michael Douglas), comes to her rescue. Later Jack and Joan discover that the package contains a treasure map showing the route to a priceless emerald. Small-time crooks Ira (Zack Norman) and Ralph (Danny DeVito) are desperate to get hold of the treasure. But they are bungling strangers in a strange land, and they have had to join forces with the ruthless guerrilla Zolo (Manuel Ojeda) in their hunt for the loot. After many narrow escapes, Jack and Joan successfully find the emerald themselves  then make plans to save Elaine from her captors, using the precious stone as bait.With its fast-paced story and entertaining action scenes, there's nothing boring about Romancing The Stone. It's certainly easy viewing, but beyond the polished surface sheen there's not that much to it. Diane Thomas's script is straightforward slam-bang stuff, offering a simple premise and punctuating the story developments with action set pieces. One benefit that does emerge from having a script penned by a female is that Turner's character has a bit more substance than most screen heroines from these kinds of pictures. Douglas and Turner bounce off each other well, and of the supporting characters DeVito generates some well-judged humour as a crook in over his head, and Alfonso Arau puts in a brief but energetic turn as a helpful driver. The plot is never less than preposterous, but this is one of those films  in a similar vein to the Indiana Jones movies  that never pretends to aspire to realism. The over-the-top action and comedy is meant to do one thing and one thing only:- to entertain. and that's exactly what it does. Romancing The Stone is fast, humorous, action-packed fun.

His first two films I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Used Cars are fun little movies, but they were not exactly the financial successes that the studios were hoping from the new whiz kid they wanted to be another Steven Spielberg. It almost looked like Zemeckis' directing days were done until Michael Douglas picked him out to direct his next producing and starring film, an original screenplay of a romance novelist finding herself in the kind of adventure she wrote about despite having live a life enclosed inside her small New York apartment. This feels the least like a Zemeckis film out of anything he made in his first twenty years or so, and that's because he really was just a director for hire. The studio wasn't terribly pleased with his work before the film's release, firing him from Cocoon as director before this even opened. Well, it went on to do well and allowed him the clout to make a little movie about a teenager who goes back in time to the 50s. Before that, though, Kathleen Turner went to Columbia to find her sister.Joan is a romance novelist who lives an incredibly sheltered life. When word reaches her that she must return a map sent to her by her sister's husband right before he died to her sister's kidnappers in Columbia, she does what she must as a good sibling and leaps out of her comfort zone to help her family. On her trail, though, is Zolo, a Columbian bureaucrat and big honcho in their secret police who wants the map for himself. He follows her, misdirecting her from Cartagena to the middle of nowhere where he tries to kill her. Just as he is about to do the deed walks in Jack T. Colton, an American staying in Columbia until he can save up enough money selling exotic birds. The accident that stranded Joan and Zolo destroyed Jack's bird collection, and when he gets Joan away form Zolo he agrees to lead her to Cartagena for three hundred seventy-five dollars.Hence begins the meet cute adventure that sends Joan into the heart of an adventure that she could have written alongside the personification of her idealized man (named Jesse in her novels) but not quite as she expected. Jack is rougher and less suave than Joan might have wanted, and their initial relationship is not one of love, but as this is a romantic adventure, they do fall in love by the end. And therein lies the movie. It's a cheerfully predictable adventure movie greenlit to give Michael Douglas a starring vehicle in the then-popular genre of Raiders of the Lost Ark rip-offs.It feels distinctly different from most of Zemeckis' work of the period because he had nothing to do with the movie's script, and neither did Bob Gale. It's a much more traditional narrative with a cleaner three act structure and a pair of characters that grow in predictable ways. It's almost a proving ground for Zemeckis to show that he could make movies other than high energy madcap adventures. Not to say that this doesn't have some of those qualities, but as a much more traditional Hollywood adventure, Romancing the Stone is Zemeckis saying, ""Of course I can make this kind of movie.""What he brings to the adventure really is the sense of energy. Action sequences are lively filmed, for instance. The sequence that takes them through a small hamlet in the four by four of the local drug kingpin who happily takes them around to show them the sights (such as where he was born) while Zolo is in hot pursuit behind them is delightful. The final sequence that pits Joan and Jack against the American kidnappers and Zolo in a Cartegena fort is alternatively funny and exciting. In the middle of it all are Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas as the central pair. Their banter is solid, their chemistry strong, and delivery never less than amusing, especially from Turner who never quite stops being terrified of the strange surroundings and events she finds herself in.Romancing the Stone is far from a challenging work, but it's both of its time and works as a fun little adventure movie outside of it. It's a good thing that audiences appreciated it in enough numbers, because if they hadn't the rest of Zemeckis' career might have never happened.",Romancing the Stone
52,TheOneThatYouWanted,Well that was a waste of time,5,2 March 2016,"I saw this on cable a few days ago and checked it out. What a mistake. The film is basically a chick flick disguised as action / adventure comedy. It really was not funny which is strange because it has Danny DeVito starring back in his prime. Really, Danny DeVito is still in his prime but you know what I mean. The only reason I'm giving this film a five out of ten is because it finally wakes up during the last 20 minutes. The last 20 minutes of the movie are what the whole thing should have been but whatever, we're talking about a movie that is more than 30 years old so who cares. There is a sequel to this film called The Jewel of the Nile which currently has a lower ranking than this movie but I'll check it out if I ever see it on TV. Purely out of curiosity. And it looks like Danny DeVito is also in The War of the Roses but now I'm just getting lost in IDBM. What can I say about this movie? It is totally boring until the last 15 or 20 minutes and not worth hunting down to watch.",Romancing the Stone
53,PredragReviews,Mature Indiana Jones!,8,9 May 2016,"""Romancing the Stone"" managed to successfully blend action and adventure with a good dose of humor that resulted in a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining experience. It also helped Michael Douglas make the jump from television to A-list movie star and shot Kathleen Turner's career into the mainstream.Ms. Turner plays romance author Joan Wilder, who in order to ransom her sister Elaine, flies to Colombia to deliver a map sent to her by her late brother-in-law. Joan soon gets involved in a bizarre situation better than anything she's ever written. She gets on the wrong bus and soon meets Jack (Michael Douglas), an adventurer who lives by his wits. He agrees to get her out of the jungle for $375 in travellers cheques, as long as they're American Express. Because Joan has the map, several factions are after her, including Ralph (Danny De Vito) and lots more scary people. Jack talks Joan into going after the treasure themselves to give her more of a bargaining chip.

The music is excellent and the scenery and setting are exciting.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Romancing the Stone
54,pc95,A Dated Adventure,6,18 April 2012,"I remember watching ""Romancing the Stone"" directed by Robert Zemeckis when I was in grade school when it first came out. I remember the protagonists being chased often. I just watched it again in it's entirety and find it a bit difficult to rate. Perhaps at one time this was a ""7"" movie, but it's dated pretty badly now. The chases are pretty standard and the climax is laughably bad. There is a fairly good setup though to the movie's credit including a great introduction. Michael Douglass is his trademark egotistical self while Kathleen Turner is satisfactory. It was some good nostalgia having not seen it for at least 17 to 20 years since, but I probably wont watch it again soon.",Romancing the Stone
55,philip_vanderveken,"Probably considered as dated by the younger audience, but it isn't bad",7,5 June 2005,"When I saw this movie, I didn't know what to think of it at first. Michael Douglas isn't exactly known as a comical actor, even though he has made some other comedies as well, but Danny DeVito is, and most of the time he doesn't do a too bad job. And when it comes to comedies, I'm more a fan of the movies from 10 or even 20 years ago. I don't like the more recent ones and there is one simple reason for that: I hate toilet humor. Let's be honest, the genre of the comedy has become so vulgar and brainless that I don't understand how they still can find people or studios to finance and produce such projects. So when I get the chance to try and see an older one, I will not let it pass.Joan Wilder, single and writer of a lot of romantic novels, finds a package from her recently murdered brother-in-law in her mailbox. A little bit later she gets a phone call from her sister, telling her that she got kidnapped and that Joan needs to bring the package, necessary for her sister's safety and release, to Columbia. Joan can't tell anybody where she is going or why she is leaving and she has no choice but to step on the next flight to Columbia. Once she arrives there, everything starts to go terribly wrong. She soon finds herself stranded in the jungle, where she is nearly murdered by the men who probably have kidnapped her sister and who are searching for the package, which contains some kind of treasure map. But in the jungle she also meets Jack Colton, an American bird collector/smuggler who will help her through a number of adventures in return for a lot of money. He looks a lot like the hero and dream man from her books, but is far from the gentleman she had in mind...Even though not everything in this movie worked perfectly, I must say that overall I had a pretty good time watching it. The acting for instance isn't bad. Especially Danny DeVito does a nice job playing the role of one of the criminals, but Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are sometimes very funny to watch too. The story may perhaps feel a bit naive and predictable from time to time and the images aren't always at the top of originality, but somehow I was able to see past that. The humor was of a decent level, I had some good laughs with it and that's still what I'm looking for in the first place when watching a comedy. Perhaps the younger audience will not like it, because the humor seems to be too 'well-behaved', but people who grew up in the eighties like me, will recognize and like the style. I give it a 6.5/10.",Romancing the Stone
56,Howlin Wolf,Michael Douglas attempts to play Indiana Jones...,8,14 June 2007,"... with one important difference: pretender Jack T. Colton comes into our story as an amoral man, which means he gets more funny one-liners. Aside from minor character tweaks, the format is basically the same, though. Turner plays an idealistic writer of chick-lit, and gives a more sympathetic performance than was pitched to the audience by Kate Capshaw in ... ""Temple of Doom"". The chemistry between the male and female lead is obvious enough that they would go on to further collaborations in the future, and the jungle maze they have to contend with is exotic and seamy enough to evoke pleasant memories of old style afternoon serials.Director Zemeckis shows his customary adeptness at handling the blend of action and comedy. If you want an old fashioned adventure to entertain the teenagers, or if you're an adult yourself who's just in the mood for some silly escapism, this is one gem that's been made to order.",Romancing the Stone
57,pyrocitor,"""We named the llama Jack Colton!""",7,29 September 2016,"Romancing the Stone opens, in a feat of winking fourth-wall poking, by thrusting the viewer into the lurid climax of one of novelist Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner)'s steamy Western romances. It's fun, cleverly energetic, and playfully teasing, leaving the features of her strapping Harlequin hunk in shadowy silhouette - who IS that masked man? The film's most exquisite metatextual joy to be had: imagining producer Michael Douglas reading the film's screenplay, and inwardly squealing ""ME, ME, IT'S ME!!!"" You can hardly blame him - the film, after all, gets off on that kind of wish fulfillment. Helmed by a pre-Back to the Future Robert Zemeckis, and sharing its same sense of colossal, goofy charm, Romancing the Stone is (nearly) clever enough to have its cake and eat it too, lampooning the matinée serial adventure silliness of Indiana Jones while still indulging in its escapist frivolities. All that, and a side of Danny DeVito, too. What's not to love? On the spectrum of 'Indiana Jones silly' to 'just-plain-silly,' the needle definitively skews closer to Brendan Fraser's Mummy than from Henry Jones Jr. Nonetheless, Zemeckis' work here is disarmingly spirited enough not to make the comparison an affront. As if trying to get a leg up on Spielberg and all his boring, pesky plots, Zemeckis keeps his film galloping along at such a breakneck pace, ricocheting from the asphalt jungles of New York (full of peddlers hocking stuffed monkeys, of all things) to the sumptuously expansive jungles of Mexi-er-Colombia, that the audience has no time to play 'count the plot holes.' After all, did Turner and Douglas stop to count, machete-ing through jungles, diving down mudslides and waterfalls, spelunking through caves clutching a tattered treasure map, and, yes, vine-swinging over a chasm with more than a twinkle in the eye? No, they assuredly did not. Indiana Jones pastiches are all fun and games, however, until the inner film critic is irked, and there's no denying that some of Zemeckis' airier touches begin to show their age. Naturally, dated racial stereotypes cheerfully abound (those seeking an inevitable accompanying drinking game: swig every time the Colombians' only discernible dialogue is ""Vámonos, muchachos!""), and Zemeckis fumbles confusedly in deciding whether to take the p*ss out of Douglas' rugged saviour stereotype or buy into it whole hog. Similarly, watching Turner and Douglas cavort around in the jungle, there's an almost comical lack of urgency to the kidnapping MacGuffin that's lured her out of her comfort zone into the realm of adventure, and Zemeckis playing it up to transparently mirror one of her novels only goes so far. Still, the action is breezy (including some James Bond calibre practical effects car flips), the setting is gorgeous, and the incomparable Alan Silvestri's musical score - the oddest blend of MTV synthpop and samba bounce - is so gosh-darn enjoyable, it alone makes the film worth the romp. Fittingly, Zemeckis stacks his cast with doppelgangers of the A-listers of old - Kathleen Turner, the spitting image of a young Lauren Bacall; Michael Douglas, jutting his chin in an impressive (and hopefully conscious) facsimile of his father - to add to the Classical Hollywood zest, and their chemistry is palpably jubilant. Turner makes for a flat-out adorable lead, ushering in her potentially stale transformation from mousy, hopeless romantic to slick action star due to her carefully honed, neurotic bubbliness. By contrast, as the man sweeping her off her feet, Douglas is, unsurprisingly, too reedy and reptilian to convince as a matinée idol worthy of the name 'Jack Colton,' but he's so enormously snarky and charismatic it's easy to forget that in the face of enjoying him try so hard. Danny DeVito's comic relief thug may occupy an entirely extraneous subplot, but, due to the fortunate side effect of being Danny DeVito, he's outrageously entertaining enough to justify inclusion with no context needed. Finally Manuel Ojeda makes for an unexpectedly debonair and genuinely frightening antagonist, as the fearsome something-or-other pursuing our heroes for some such undefined reason. It's somewhat of a forgotten relic of the decade, and hasn't aged as memorably as the more straightforward adventure yarns it pokes fun at and lusts after but Zemeckis' earliest hit is carefree charm personified, and easily worth its while. Romancing the Stone (you've been waiting for a metaphor as lazy as this, but what can I say: this is a film all about giving the people what they want) is one buried treasure worth excavating, even from the belly of the crocodile of time (sure). -7/10",Romancing the Stone
58,xredgarnetx,A classic,8,29 August 2006,"ROMANCING THE STONE is highly recommended to film buffs, especially those under 30 who have never seen it. A young and attractive Kathleen Turner plays a romance novelist whose world is turned upside down when her sister is kidnapped and held ransom for a map Turner has in her possession. The adventure takes her to wild and wooly Colombia, where she encounters an adventurer and jack of all trades, played by an equally young and dashing Michael Douglas, who has proved he can play any role with equal aplomb, from the U.S. president and the nation;s drug czar to a drug-addled university professor and a deranged office worker. The fun in this movie is watching these two excellent actors play off each other; they have real chemistry and would team up again a couple of years later for a pretty decent sequel. And then many years later, they would again play opposite each other, this time as bickering spouses in WAR OF THE ROSES. One might almost say their ROSES characters are the same characters from STONE, just years later with the honeymoon definitely over. Director Robert ""Contact"" Zemeckis for once directs a movie that is not technology-riddled, so nothing dampens or ruins or slows down the fun. For those who only know Turner as a supporting player who excels as overweight hags and busybodies, seeing her in STONE will be a revelation. And while Douglas has also done some aging, it also is a nice surprise to see him in all his boyish charm. This is his pre-DON'T SAY WORD/FALLING DOWN/TRAFFIC/ paternal roles.

""Romancing the Stone"" is about a timid novelist (Kathleen Turner) joining forces with a soldier of fortune (Michael Douglas) on a fantastic adventure in Columbia in search of priceless jewel.

This film is SO 1980s it's almost a crime. But maybe that's also why it's so endearing and fun to watch, even if it is on a smaller scale than the Indiana Jones trilogy (which it so obviously mocks here and there). Turner and Douglas play well off each other and Danny DeVito has a fun bit as a reluctant pursuer.Oh and for all you fans of the Friday the 13th series, that's a former Jason Voorhees in the opening, Ted White, as Groven.

In addition, if you're not able to take a classic romantic action adventure masterpiece, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Romancing the Stone (1984) is a classic romantic action adventure flick that I love so much! I grew up watching this movie and it has a heart. In the opening scene on the wild west, first I thought it is a western movie, when that girl Angelina (Kymberly Herrin) throws a knife in to Grogan (Ted White) killing him and than she flees in to the west. Grogan's brothers come after her, firing guns, but her lover Jessie (William H. Burton Jr.) comes to the rescue and safes her. When they kiss, the opening scene ends and I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't a western movie that I thought when I saw Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) typing, but even after that, the movie gave me a heck of a ride, with a lot of suspense and twists around. This movie is fast paced, highly entertaining and a heck of a ride. Even tough Michael Douglas is in the lead role and this movie made me in to a Michael Douglas fan, I must say watching this again on Blu-ray: I have enjoyed Kathleen Turner much more in this movie than I did Michael Douglas. She should be in the lead role and not him. She steal the show not Michael Douglas! Plot: Kathleen Turner is Joan, a romance novelist who gets caught up in a real life South American adventure when she is forced to find a mysterious treasure in order to rescue her sister. During her quest, she is assisted by Jack Colton (Michael Douglas), a bird smuggler. When Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner)'s sister Elaine is kidnapped and her sister Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor) calls her and tells her,that she is kidnapped and she needs the map, her dead husband sent to her by mail, or her kidnappers will kill her, Joan didn't even hesitate, not even for a second to help her sister out, she drops everything and fly's instantly to Colombia, Cartagena o safe her sister. She wasn't an asshole, or selfish, she did everything that is in her power, that she would safe her sister. She wasn't a selfish or a jerk, she had a heart and she cared what happened the her only sister. She paid for the tickets to fly down there, that is what I love in this movie. That is rare in the family Joan was brave and she risk her own life for saving her family, her only sister. I love the scene where Jack and Joan race through the jungle with Columbian police in hot pursuit. In the scene which they come to a rickety bridge over a chasm and Jack wanted to fight but Joan was so brave that she went to cross the bridge on her own risk and she did, she grab a vine and she swing across the bridge saving her self, ha ha that scene was awesome. On the end scene she fought alone with Zolo (Manuel Ojeda) which she defeated him by her self all alone. While Jack was trying to get that Diamond and than he tried to help Joan but he couldn't. I love when Joan throws the knife in to Zolo but he catches the knife with the wood in his hand that was spectacular! I seriously love the last scene when Joan saved her sister on the end of the movie and she wrote and publish her latest book. I really love this movie to death and it is my favorite film I love it. I love the score by Alan Silvestri he was awesome, the score for the whole movie is so beautiful. I love the action sequences and I also love the shoot outs with Michael Douglas and Manuel Ojeda on the bus that was spectacular. I really do believe this movie is a classic I really do believe that. Last actor I have forgot was Danny DeVito as Ralph a small criminal who was also after for that stone and that map, Danny was always amazing, I grew up watching his movies famous roles from Romancing the Stone and Batman Returns. I would say Danny is amazing guy and awesome actor, I love him. I miss the 80's, this one is fantastic and the score from Alan Silvestri is literally awesome I love it. I love the character Joan Wilder in this movie, I love Kathleen Turner's character. I even love the happy ending. Overall: This movie get's a perfect 10 by me. I have enjoyed this movie and it was a fun adventure action flick. Once Joan begins her bus trip into the jungle from there, it's a rather fun flick with a good dose of action, some great scenery, some good laughs, and a few misfires. I hardly believe that this movie turned 30 years after it was filmed. This movie to me feels that it is forgotten, because I don't see or hear anyone that talks about it. I have still grew up, with this movie it is my favorite childhood film and I don't care what anyone says about it. I love it. Romancing the Stone is a 1984 American action-adventure romantic comedy.

63,gab-14712,"A Fun, Silly Adventure!",8,15 April 2020,"1984's Romancing the Stone is truly a silly, but entertaining adventure. People view this movie as a Raiders of the Lost Ark rip-off, but this movie deserves that statement but in a positive way. It captures the sense of adventure and the humor the Spielberg movie has, although it's not as good as that classic. It helps that there is intense, sparkling chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. It's one of those movies that shock you when you find out these two actors are not committed to one another in real life, because the chemistry between the two stars is fire!The man behind the camera is Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis is now seen as one of cinema's greats especially when it comes to his Back to the Future trilogy. First, he had to prove himself and he certainly did so here. I find it funny that 20th Century Fox, the film's studio, thought this film would bomb so hard, so hard that they fired Zemeckis from their next big-budget sci-fi picture. Ironically, this film was the studio's only major hit of 1984 and it allowed Zemeckis to direct the much-loved Back to the Future. It helps that he did a good job directing the film. The actors grew frustrated with him at times as a young film school graduate obsessed with camera angles and the like, but he held his own for his first major Hollywood picture.The film has a unique premise that was written into a screenplay by Diane Thomas, which was sadly her only Hollywood screenplay because of an untimely car accident death. What if a romance author lives out her stories she became famous for? I thought it was really cool and for the most part, the film captured this sense of uniqueness with its fun adventure sequences and sparkling romance.Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is this aforementioned romance author who has written many, many romantic novels set in adventure settings. One day, she receives a treasure map in the mail from her murdered brother-in-law; a treasure map leading to a green stone with unlimited value. Her sister, Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor) is kidnapped by the short, measly Ralph (Danny DeVito) and his associate. Joan is forced to go to South America to trade the map for her sister but is taken herself by a corrupt cop named Zolo (Miguel Ojeda) who wants the map for himself. Lost in the jungle, she is rescued by the dashing Jack Colton (Michael Douglas). He agrees to take her back to civilization. It seems like Joan may be living out one of her adventures!The stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are front-and-center and the film takes advantage of that. They exchange barbs and witty dialogue on a consistent basis and its very amusing. I also like how Douglas makes Turner his equal. In films of yonder, women were very tender and needed to be rescued without having any sense of strength. Luckily, Zemeckis does away with that silly trope. Danny DeVito admittedly got on my nerves from time to time, but maybe it's because his attempt at being a villain is pathetic (in a good way).Kathleen Turner later admitted after the film's release that she grew frustrated with Zemeckis's style of direction. They often clashed on set due to their old school versus new school differences. I found it amazing considering Turner did an amazing job with her performance. Zemeckis must have agreed because he later casted her as Jessica Rabbit in 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit?Don't get me wrong. Romancing the Stone is not going to win Best Picture and its not one of those artsy flicks. Yeah, the dialogue can be corny, and the events can be unbelievable. Honestly, do we even care? The sense of fun has no boundaries here. I can watch these types of movies time after time and never grow bored. Sure, it's no Indiana Jones, but it does not need to be! As long as you are in the mood for a fun adventure, then I can recommend the film for you.My Grade: B",Romancing the Stone

Douglas should technically have no brains at all due to the fact that he spends most of his waking life uncorking women.Plot: Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a lonely New York romance novelist who receives a treasure map mailed to her by her recently-murdered brother-in-law. Her widowed sister, Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor), calls Joan and begs her to come to Cartagena, Colombia because Elaine has been kidnapped by bumbling antiquities smugglers Ira (Zack Norman) and Ralph (Danny DeVito), and the map is to be the ransom.Hastily flying to Colombia, Joan is detoured from the rendezvous with Ralph by Colonel Zolo (Manuel Ojeda), the man who killed Elaine's husband. Joan ends up in the jungle and is almost killed by Zolo, but is saved by the swashbuckling American bird exporter Jack Colton (Michael Douglas). For getting her to Cartagena, Joan promises to pay Jack $375.Jack and Joan elude Zolo, who wants the treasure for himself and who chases them with military police, which he commands as a ""private army"". After spending a night hiding in a crashed marijuana smuggler's airplane, they encounter a drug lord named Juan (Alfonso Arau), who is a big fan of Joan's novels and who helps them escape from Zolo.After a night of dancing and passion, Joan suggests to Jack that they find the treasure before handing over the map. They follow the clues and find the treasure: an enormous emerald called el Corazon (""the Heart""). Unknown to Jack and Joan, their trail has been picked up by Ralph, who tries to take the emerald and taunts Joan that Jack would have done the same.But Ralph flees without the treasure when Zolo appears, and Jack and Joan are chased into a river and go over a waterfall. Jack and Joan end up on opposite sides of the raging river; Joan has the map, but Jack has the emerald. Jack directs Joan to Cartagena, promising that he will meet her there with the emerald, but she is skeptical, owing to Ralph's taunts.In Cartagena, Joan contacts Ira, but cannot find Jack. She meets with Ira and Ralph at their base (an old fortress) and makes the exchange. As Joan and Elaine attempt to leave, they are stopped by Zolo and his men, who have captured Jack. Zolo demands the emerald and threatens Joan with the crocodiles that Ira keeps as pets. To save Joan, Jack surrenders the hidden emerald to Zolo, but a crocodile bites off Zolo's hand and swallows it along with the emerald.As a furious gun battle takes place between Zolo's soldiers and Ira's gang, Joan and Elaine dash for safety, but they are pursued by the enraged Zolo. Jack tries to stop the crocodile from escaping but lets it go when he sees that Joan is in danger. Joan knocks Zolo into the crocodile pit, and Ira and his men escape, but Ralph is left behind as the authorities arrive. After a kiss, Jack dives into the water after the crocodile, leaving Joan behind with her sister.Some time later, Joan is back in New York, delivering a new manuscript based on her adventure, and her publisher, Gloria (Holland Taylor), loves it. Returning home, she finds Jack waiting for her in a sailboat. He caught the crocodile (and had it made into a pair of boots), sold the emerald, and bought the boat he had told Joan was his dream. They go off together, planning to sail around the world.P.S: I never did like that over-sized b*tch of an actress Kathleen Turner.",Romancing the Stone

Nothing to do with the excessive violence and noise of nowadays's action films and also with no need of any special effects at all - and it works so well! This movie proves that a simple but good story with no special effects can make a quality film and such thing is certainly much better than a movie with only special effects but no plot.The movie is supposed to take place in Colombia, but it was filmed in Mexico. Who cares anyway? The scenario is one of the many solid attributes of the film. Cartagena is a beautiful place and the colombian jungles are amazing either. The backgrounds/landscapes are simply brilliant: forests, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, clouds, etc...This film features the talents of actors such as Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, Danny DeVito, Zack Norman, Alfonso Arau, Manuel Ojeda, Holland Taylor, Mary Ellen Trainor, Kymberly Herrin, Ted White and others. All of them are very well in their roles. It was directed by the great Robert Zemeckis, who also directed ""Back to the Future"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""The Polar Express"".The characters are all well developed and interesting. Jack T. Colton is a funny fortune soldier (the ""T"" means trustworthy, according to himself) and he's greatly played by Michael Douglas. Joan Wilder is the romance novelist of the story, very well portrayed by a beautiful Kathleen Turner. Zolo is a very dangerous and persistent villain, well played by Manuel Ojeda. Ira is obsessed by crocodiles and often says «Look at those snappers» - he's portrayed by Zack Norman. Ralph is a funny, very tense, nervous and stressful villain, comically played by Danny DeVito. But despite being villains, both Ralph and Ira fear Zolo and his men because they know how dangerous they are. Juan is a very humorous character, beautifully portrayed by Alfonso Arau.The movie contains some swear language, but with moderation. They don't overdo it, so this detail doesn't ruin a movie with little to be improved for me. This movie also contains some cool Spanish lines. The emerald (called ""El Corázon"") is a gorgeous precious stone! Romeo (Joan Wilder's cat) is beautiful, adorable and fluffy. I wouldn't mind to have a cat like him (and Romeo is a cute name for a cat).As a fan of cars, I also have a word to say about some of the cars used in this film. The Ford Bronco is the off-road vehicle that really shines here. It is a bullet-proof pick-up off-road vehicle baptized as ""Pepe, the little mule"" by its owner Juan. That is a fabulous car! Wow! That is war material. It's also delightful to see the legendary Renault 4L, also known as ""quatrelle"", but internationally known as simply the Renault 4. The Renault 4 is one of the best cars in the world. It has charming lines, a bullet-proof reliability and is an indestructible and very robust car. There's also a Shelby Cobra replica in this film (a fantastic and charismatic car) driven by a boy who looks like Joaquin Garay III but I don't know for sure if that's him.""Romancing The Stone"" is one of the best movie choices to watch on a Saturday afternoon. It is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year 1984. Eddy Grant's song ""Romancing the Stone"" is great, why wasn't it included in the film?This should definitely be on Top 250.",Romancing the Stone
67,RonellSowes,Neither funny nor exciting,4,22 November 2020,"Romancing The Stone is meant to be a comedy so criticizing how ridiculous and stupid it is,is a little besides the point. But some moments really push it like:escaping a gang of drug runners because they recognize your the author of the romance novels they read every night. The film is filled with ludicrous action sequences that have no tension nor humor. Certainly not one of Robert Zemeckis' better attempts.
Not to mention the 'funny' dialogue which just leaves you shaking your head(at least I was shaking my head perhaps such derpy discussions appeal to you).The characters in this film,particularly the antagonists,are caricatures of actual human beings. The main villain,Zolo,is very much just cartoonish version of Dr Szell from Marathon Man. One is former military the other is a revolutionary/army leader,they both go to New York to get jewels and they both use automatic knives. And if you think you can get me to mention the great Sir Laurence Olivier's name with that guy,you are quite wrong.Perhaps it was meant to be an entertaining,light adventure flick but the result is inanely dull.",Romancing the Stone

70,FloatingOpera7,Films Of The 80's: Romancing The Stone,10,29 May 2007,"Romancing The Stone (1984): Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas, Danny DeVito, Mary Ellen Trainor, Zack Norman, Alfonso Arau, Manuel Ojeda, Holland Taylor, Eve Smith, Joe Nesnow, Jose Chavez, Camillo Garcia, Rodrigo Puebla, Evita Munoz, Paco Morayta, Kimberly Herin, Jorge Zamora, William H. Burton, Ted White, Michael Cassidy, Vinent Deadrick Sr, Richard Drown, Jeff Ramsey, Joe Finnegan, Jimmy Medearis, Ron Silvers...Director Robert Zemeckis, Screenplay Diane Thomas, Lem Dobbs, Howard Franklin, Treva Silverman.Released in 1984 by director Robert Zemeckis, this is a film that easily won the hearts of movie-goers with a taste for romance and adventure. Michael Douglas's career really took off in the 80's (Wall Street, Fatal Attraction) and there is genuine chemistry with Kathleen Turner in this film, the first of subsequent films they would do together (Jewel of the Nile, War Of The Roses). Set in New York City, Joan Wilder (Turner) is a romantic novelist looking to write the one big novel that will make her or break her. Pressured by her publisher and friend Gloria (Holland Taylor) she begins work on a new novel but she's interrupted by the shocking news of her sister's abduction in Columbia, where she is being held hostage for a ransom. Joan's apartment is broken into and a mysterious treasure map arrives via postal package. Before long, she goes to Columbia to save her sister and embarks on a dangerous adventure with a priceless emerald involved. She's joined by bad boy Jack Colton (Douglas) who dreams of buying a ship and sailing around the world. Danny DeVito, a well-known star by this point, appears for comic relief as Ralph and would again reprise the role for the film's sequel ""Jewel of the Nile"". For some reason, his casting is a success for he is funny, smart-alecky and the kinda guy you don't want to hate because he is so much like someone we know. His chemistry with Douglas and Turner also lend itself to the success of the later film ""War of the Roses"". The success of ""Romancing The Stone"" owes to its timing. In '84, adventure films were invading mainstream American film. By this time people were eating up the ""Indiana Jones"" films, and this film is similar in its adventure theme. The film differs from the Indiana Jones film in that this is also more of a romantic comedy. Though there are ""bad guys"", the heroes are flawed and governed by personal passions. The original music is by Alan Silvestri, who would compose many other Hollywood film scores and the cinematography is glorious - excellent vistas of the jungle and high mountains of Columbia where the film was shot. The film is not based on any book or comic-book but rather was an original screenplay, the work of many writers. The sequel ""Jewel of the Nile"" is absolutely inferior to this great film and was made simply to cater to fans. If you love adventure, good comedy and romance, this film is for you. At the time, it was also a date film and can still be a date film. This is feel-good movie, a movie movie and to this date people still enjoy that kind of thing, especially because it's a type of film that is non-existent in our present day.",Romancing the Stone
71,moviesleuth2,"Goofy and Silly, but still a lot of fun.",8,8 January 2010,"""Romancing the Stone"" is a slight but humorous adventure. It's in the same vein as Indiana Jones, although this one more thoroughly embraces its goofiness. It's not perfect, but it is entertaining.Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is an introverted novelist who has become famous for writing romantic adventures. However, she's about to get an adventure of her own: her sister Elaine calls her frantically from Columbia, telling her that she has been kidnapped and her captors want the map that her husband sent her right before she was killed. So Joan flies down to Columbia to make the delivery, despite the fact that she has no idea what she's doing. Luckily, she runs into Jack T. Colton (Michael Douglas), who for 250 dollars in traveler's checks is willing to help her out. Meanwhile, she's got the police, headed by Zolo (Manuel Ojeda), and one of the kidnappers, the hilariously inept Ralph (Danny DeVito).There is no possible way anyone can take this movie seriously, and that's the best way to view it. It's totally ridiculous, and it knows it. Although some of the humor may have lost its bite over the years, there are laughs to be had (particularly when they run into Juan (Alfonso Arau), a Columbian kingpin, who's also a huge fan of Wilder's), and it's impossible not to be won over by its charm.The acting is solid. Michael Douglas shines as the rough and tough hero. It's not an original character, but Douglas keeps things interesting. Kathleen Turner is a little too neurotic in the beginning but she gets in step before long. Danny DeVito is hilarious as the hopelessly inept kidnapper. Constantly outsmarted, outwitted and outdone, DeVito represents the best type of comedy: a comic personality that feels genuine. You don't get that anymore. Manuel Ojeda is suitably vicious as the corrupt policeman, despite not saying much. Alfonso Arau is known as a director of magical romance films, but he started out as an actor. He steals his scene as Juan, who even Jack admits is crazier than he is.For once, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't rely on quick cuts or camera tricks to be enjoyable. Zemekis, who is known for pushing the boundaries of special effects, uses stuntwork (probably because CGI was almost non-existent at the time of making) and it works. The cinematography is great, and the timing of the jokes is solid. He also pays attention to the characters, and delicately builds the romance between Jack and Jane (this isn't a spoiler since it's inevitable in these types of movies, and there isn't a person alive who isn't going to recognize the double meaning in the title).The bottom line is that ""Romancing the Stone"" is great, simple fun.",Romancing the Stone

76,jhaggardjr,Superb adventure-comedy,10,6 January 2001,"""Romancing the Stone"" is argubly my favorite adventure movie of all-time. Yep, in my opinion it surpasses all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy (which are right behind in terms of greatness). This movie has action, adventure, comedy, drama, and romance all rolled up into one great motion picture. Kathleen Turner stars as Joan Wilder, a romance novelist who flies to the South American country of Colombia to rescue her kidnapped sister. She's ordered by the kidnappers to bring a treasure map that she received in the mail with her to the Colombian city of Cartegna. Ms. Wilder ends up getting on the wrong bus that ends up taking her deep into the jungle where she meets a fortune hunter who saves her life in more ways than one. He also seems to resemble the hero in her books. Jack Colton, the fortune hunter, is played by Michael Douglas (who also produced the film) and he talks her into using the map to find the treasure. But they're not the only ones who are dying to get their hands on the treasure. A couple of bad guys are in hot pursuit of the two adventurers. There's Zolo (Manuel Ojeda), an evil colonel who's on to Ms. Wilder (and is the real nasty bad guy of the bunch); Ira (Zack Norman), one of the crazed kidnappers who's obsessed with crocodiles (he's always saying ""Look at those snappers!""); and Ralph (Danny DeVito), Ira's bumbling cousin who goes to the airport to pick up Ms. Wilder, see's at the last second that she got on the wrong bus, and is forced to go into the jungle to find her. Even Ralph and Ira know that Zolo is bad news. There are also minor supporting characters in the film. There's Gloria (Holland Taylor from TV's ""The Practice""), Ms. Wilder's publisher; Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor), Ms. Wilder's sister; and Juan (Alfonso Arau), a Colombian native who actually turns out to be a huge fan of Ms. Wilder. In one very funny scene, Ms. Wilder and Mr. Colton go to the house of this man and ask him if they can borrow his car. The Colombian tells them to get lost, until he finds out that the woman is actually Joan Wilder the novelist, and admits that he's one of her biggest fans who has read every one of her books. He proceeds to help the two get out of a jam. ""Romancing the Stone"" has plenty of exhilarating action scenes, and a load of big laughs. This was director Robert Zemeckis' first hit movie (which he made before the original ""Back to the Future""), and I still think this is his best film. Zemeckis is one of our best directors working today, and rarely (like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron) does he make a bad film. ""Romancing the Stone"" is a great movie. Turner is splendid as the novelist up to her neck in trouble; Douglas is terrific as her sidekick; and Norman and Arau are hilarious in smaller roles. But the one who provides the biggest laughs in the movie is Danny DeVito. He is literally a scream in ""Romancing the Stone"". I kept falling down on my side because he had me laughing so hard. This is one movie that's a must-see for people who like a mix of action, suspense, adventure, romance, thrills, and lots of comedy. One of the '80s best. Followed by the very good sequel ""Jewel of the Nile"".**** (out of four)",Romancing the Stone

But it's been well over a decade since I've sat down to enjoy it. It was on cable steadily in the 80's and I never got tired of it. Back then, I had just discovered my love for adventure. I had seen Raiders of the Lost Ark and a few 007 movies. I was a geeky kid who wanted to roam the world, getting into wild adventures and live life to the max. This movie was more realistic and still offered a lot of fun and a little romancing too.""I'm stealing this stone! I'm not trying to romance it out from under her!""Michael Douglas, I now admit, had never appealed to me until this movie. He seemed like a not so great carbon copy of his dad, Kirk Douglas. But this movie changed all that and made him seem funny and cool. This is also what solidified my adoration of Kathleen Turner. She is simply perfect as Joan Wilder. Together with Danny DeVito, a cool cinematic trio was born.""Look at those snappers, Ralph!""Romancing the Stone always seemed like it was out of time, but still firmly in the 80's. This could easily have starred Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall back in the day, and would be held up as a classic today. I think it is a classic, and it's too bad it isn't recognized as such more widely. It's an adventure movie like Raiders of the Lost Ark, which it is often accused of ripping off, but the script was written in the 70's.""Of all the things you could say to me right now, 'I lost her, Ralph' is gonna get the most teeth broken in your mouth!""Robert Zemeckis was already showing his brilliance here that would go on to give us Back to the Future and Forrest Gump later on. This was the first score Alan Silvestri ever did for Zemeckis, and It's so good Zemeckis gave him the job for every movie he did ever since.""How will you die, Joan Wilder? Slow...like a snail? Or fast, like a shooting star?""It's fun, exciting and there's some thrills and a sense of danger. There's actual romance too. It appeals to guys and their gals. It's simply a perfect movie for people who love movies.""You're the best time I've ever had.""",Romancing the Stone

A nice X-mas movie if you can cope with the silly lovestory. Maybe a bit hyped and a total ripoff of Indiana Jones. Later the lead actor would become famous in some scandals, of course.

Think about it when you laugh at the joke about ""you must mean my little mule"" and actually want these 2 characters to fall in love and get together.Maybe it works because you have the 2 opposite characters who are obviously incomplete and who need each other to grow and become better. Then there is the fact they both work on finding out the good in each other (not endlessly bickering like some other movies).

Of course everyone is entitled to their fantasies, but this film just didn't work for me, perhaps because I'm a man, I don't know.

87,buzznzipp1995,A shiny 'gem' in the comedy world.,10,27 July 2006,"This movie won a few awards, and it should have. After I saw this back in 1984 in the theater, I went back and saw it probably 4 or 5 times more. I was only in high school, but I really enjoyed the set up and the execution of this smart, 'Jungle-Love' story. The real test is how does it do over time and watching it 21+ years later, it still holds itself in a practically perfect place. I know it was eighty-four then, but it just still plays out well, everything is still as it should be. It is amazing that the original role of the male lead was offered to Christopher Reeves (Superman) that would have been a whole different Jack Colten, character no doubt about it in my mind.Two convincing actors and a right on supporting cast, a location that is very odd for a romance to take place, however it takes shape along the way. You understand the story as it unfolds, and does it very well! The acting was vaudevillian at times and very 'festive' at other times, and made for an interesting combination. The 'adversarial' Ira and Devito's Character 'Ralph' was quite a surprisingly wise choice as an assistant Villain. For as much suspense filled activity, really great performance and dialog between the characters in this first, a second installment was made as a continuation of the story. This was 'The Jewel Of The Nile'. Now this with a few great scenes, set-up shots framed really 'smart' and the 'Jewel', his performance in the movie that was sort of a heart-warming, attribute, beside that what cooled it for me was, taking a natural order of people, and inserting American-pop music into their midst and trying to make as if it was all just happening that way. I didn't understand that. It may be small to someone else, but to me it is an authenticating problem. There was a change of directors for 'Jewel' as well and just a bit too much hustle and bustle, just kind of going through one tribe and nationality to another, then a 'scenery' change at one point, that if it was the same country and area they were filming in, it didn't seem like it was the same area once the change of camera shots had happened. It ended the saga and connected the story, but I am quite satisfied with the original storyline and Zemekis's Directing. (***)",Romancing the Stone

The most ineffective part was the romance between Kathleen and Mike. I didn't buy it for a minute because Mr. Douglas was portrayed from the getgo as an unlikeable person without dating or matrimony appeal. So, the romance that blossomed between the two was unbelievable. Even in ""Fatal Attraction"", which was a much better movie, Mike was not likable, but in that movie, it didn't matter because it wasn't a romance.Harrison Ford would have been more suited for this movie because he's emotionally well rounded. He can go from rough and tough to soft and sensitive all in one movie.

Well done actions scenes and camera work. Good special affects with some funny ones in there too. Not the biggest budget for special affects but they had some really great stunt work.Story:
Very immersive, crazy, and at times comedic plot. I loved how the woman who is a famous romance novelist has never found love, let alone romance in her life. Then finds herself in a twist and lives a story of her own. Great beginning, middle and end.

Douglas and De Vito are great but to me the film belongs to Kathleen Turner, she's fantastic and looks absolutely stunning. Its also very well directed from the future director of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump amongst others. Its often mentioned as a rip off of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but I don't really think it is that apparent, the scenes in the Jungle at the start of the film are really good especially when they find the crashed plane ""There's nothing like a good fire""!!!. Danny De Vito is really funny as the comic relief and his cousin has some funny lines ""Look at them snappers, would ya"". My only small complaint is the romantic stuff is a little corny but I suppose thats for the female audience. They followed this up with ""Jewel of the Nile"" just a year later! Sadly like most sequels it wasn't nearly as good as this, actually its not really worth bothering about unfortunately, Douglas, Turner and De Vito also teamed up again in another film ""War of the Roses"" but that film has no connection with this or Jewel of the Nile.

Robert Zemeckis directs the film with the appropriate light-hearted touch, yet also does not shy away from some of the more unpleasant attributes of Diane Thomas' screenplay, which builds to a surprisingly suspenseful climax. The film also seamlessly pays homage to the classic screwball comedies of the thirties and forties, with magnetic chemistry between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as they entertainingly hurl the expected barbs at one another without the slightest feeling of script contrivance. STONE also features a memorable supporting turn from Danny DeVito, who manages to effectively serve as comic relief without interfering with the surrounding romance and action.Although nominally an exotic jungle adventure involving a mysterious treasure map and a priceless jewel, ROMANCING THE STONE is actually a perfectly structured showcase for the amazing Kathleen Turner, in a terrific, Golden Globe-winning performance. It is through the eyes of Turner's character that the story unravels, and her character's drastic development is what supplies the film with it's heart. The transformation from bookish wallflower to capable heroine has been played by many actresses over the years, but few have managed to pull it off with the class and finesse of Turner. There is much to love in the film with impressive stunt work and beautiful scenery, but it is the husky-voiced Turner's immensely likable and totally believable performance that truly makes the picture a sentimental favorite of mine.",Romancing the Stone

When she returns, her room is rifled through for a package her late brother in law mailed to her. She gets a call from her sister Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor)to come to Columbia namely Cartagena to get the map to her as she has been kidnapped.After the bus she's on (leading here AWAY from Cartagena) crashes, enter Jack T Colton who saves her from Colonel Zolo, a corrupt cop who is also the man that murdered Joan's brother in law. We are lead through mazes of jungle, shootouts with police, Mounties, the kidnapper's cousin (Danny DeVito) all trying to get their hands on the map.The end is a spectacle and polishes the film very well. I enjoyed the rising action, the height of the action and the falling action (literary terms) that gave us the film that is Romancing the Stone The music is mostly derived from one score by film veteran Alan Silvestri and the soundtrack is great. However, it is easy to get some of the music titles mixed up If you want a great romantic dramedy adventure film, Romancing the Stone is a great one stop shop!",Romancing the Stone
98,fletch5,Highly enjoyable,9,5 October 2000,"""Romancing the Stone"" is one of the most enjoyable mixtures of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas are a magnificent pair, and director Robert Zemeckis keeps the pace going.

99,moviemattb,"Not Zemeckis' best film, but it is worth watching",8,19 November 2014,"""Romancing the Stone"" is not really Robert Zemeckis' best film, but it is worth watching. I am not sure if I have a whole lot say about this movie, but I'll give it a try. ""Romancing the Stone"" is about a lonely author Joan Wilder, who is writing her latest novel receives a phone call from her sister that she has been kidnapped in Colombia by a group of bad guys, then tells her to bring the map of treasure if she ever wants her sister back and alive again. So she travels to Colombia, and comes across a smuggler Jack T. Colton as they both teamed up to not only get her sister back, but find the emerald. The movie does have some good laughs, but I only wish if it could use some more humor. Although the movie isn't trying to be a comedy because all it wanted it is to be an action-adventure movie with romance as what the title says ""Romancing the Stone."" That is just me, in my opinion. With that said, I thought the action in this movie is well done but there are not as exciting as some of the action in the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. The cast in this movie did great. I thought Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas both made a very good chemistry with each other, and they do carry out as the pacing goes along. Also, I thought Danny DeVito did good too. Alan Silvestri does a fine job with score, but nothing too special about it. The movie is also well written; well filmed; and it is well directed by Zemeckis. It is interesting to know that this movie did well for Zemeckis as he would later go on to directed the ""Back to the Future"" movies; ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?;"" and many others as well as winning best director for ""Forrest Gump."" So that is how much I got to say about this movie. Again, it's not Zemeckis' best film, but it is worth watching. I give it an 8 out of 10.",Romancing the Stone

The plot is stupid to begin with, the villains are unconvincing even for a comedy (plus one of them is the guy I hate in every movie - De Vito), and two main characters are not too interesting (although one can't deny some chemistry between them).However, there are some successful jokes there, and Kathleen Turner is always sexy, but if I want to watch her again I'll watch ""Prizzi's Honor"" instead.",Romancing the Stone

Unlike his father, Kirk Douglas, he is good at portraying light comedy roles beset with adventure. However, his father could perform towering historical roles like in Spartacus, sturdy and sombre western roles and serious roles with quite beguiling perfection.Whereas, Michael belongs to the next generation suited to perform light comedy, crazy and romantically charged roles. With versatile and vivacious Kathleen, this movie becomes very interesting. De-Devito adds more acid to the feisty adventure and one cannot but feel exhilarated after watching the movie. The next episode ""The Jewel of the Nile"" featuring this pair (Michael & Kathleen) could not draw those crowds, which were witnessed during this movie.This type of entertainment seems more real and satisfying to watch than the present day loaded fiction movies with creepy and bizarre creatures which present nothing but ridicule and puerile joy to an already crazy audience.",Romancing the Stone
103,Hotwok2013,One of the the all-time great watchable movies.,10,15 July 2014,"""Romancing The Stone"" is one of those movies that just works on every level. It works as an adventure, it works as a romance & it works as a comedy. In short, IT JUST WORKS!. Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner have never been involved in a more entertaining movie & almost certainly never will again. Also, Michael Douglas has said in a TCM interview that they cast Danny DeVito in the movie because of his peculiar comic ability & how right they were. After her sister is kidnapped in Columbia authoress Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is forced to travel there to try & rescue her. After leaving the airport in Columbia she needs to travel to Cartegena but is put on the wrong bus by corrupt police chief Zolo (Manuel Ojeda). Zolo's interest in Ms Wilder is that he believes she has in her possession an old map which tells the location of a huge & valuable emerald, (hence the title of the movie), which he desperate to get his hands on. Earlier Zolo broke into her apartment to try and steal it. One of Ms Wilder's neighbours tried to stop him breaking into her apartment and Zolo stabbed him to death. After sleeping on the bus she wakes up to find herself travelling in the Columbian jungle & realises something might be wrong. As she consults the bus driver he crashes into a Land Rover belonging to Jack Colton (Michael Douglas). What follows is a really marvellous escapist adventure movie that will cheer up anybody feeling a bit down in the dumps. There are many entertainingly memorable scenes in this movie which makes it great fun to watch. My only criticism is that the IMDb user rating of 6.9 is way too low for a movie of such superb entertainment value.

Beginning with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", followed by this movie, with ""Alan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold"" bringing up the rear.  I actually like this movie better.  I think Michael Douglas does the tongue in cheek thing better and although I am not a Kathleen Turner fan, she plays off him much better than Karen Allen did Harrison Ford.  Danny De Vito is a laugh riot - something really lacking in ""Raiders"".

Romancing The Stone was originally a book by Diane Thomas. Designed to be her 'version' of Raiders Of The Lost Ark, she pitched the idea for the movie to Steven Spielberg. Having not wanting to repeat the recycled idea, Steven turned her to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, who were his 'interns' at the time. Romancing The Stone has become one of the first in a long run of having a female protagonist as the lead role. Kathleen Turner may have had a defining role in Body Heat, but this picture gave us a more down to earth character for turner to play. It's a brilliant thrill ride from start to finish. All three of the films leads, Douglas, Turner and DeVito have been defined with this movie as a staple for their careers. The start of production of Romancing The Stone would also form a strong bond with each other. They all came back to do the Back To The Future trilogy as well as Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump and countless other Hollywood hits.

Three years earlier, Raiders of the Lost Ark made a clear path for adventure films, and this movie, directed by some dude named Robert Zemeckis (who later did some flicks about time-traveling DeLoreans, framed rabbits, and a guy named Gump), cleverly follows the footsteps. My favorite scene is a jump-out-of-your-seat surprise near the end; let's just say you learn why you shouldn't stick your hand out over dank and eerie swamps.

The race also includes helpful drug smugglers, hungry crocodiles and perhaps the biggest mudslide in film history. Douglas also produced and this was a big earner at the box office and garnered a sequel in JEWEL OF THE NILE that didn't work as well as the original.

But Kathleen Turner is really the star of the movie - it's her story - and she is just excellent. Plus, besides the two stars, there's the magnificent Danny De Vito - who is so good, you just can't get enough of him - he practically steals the show - especially when he's in the police station and falls off the desk !

Robert Zemeckis must be credited with keeping this film going at an incredible pace, pushing all the right buttons, knowing what the audience wants, and obviously gaining much influence from Spielberg.

Its funny, it's action packed. it has everything a great should.Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is a romance novelist in New York. She recently heard that her sister Elaine's husband was killed in Colombia, and Elaine is still there. One day, after receiving a yet-unopened package from Elaine's husband, she comes home to find her apartment trashed. Then Elaine calls and tells her that she's been held hostage and the people holding her want a map sent to Joan. Joan opens the package, and sees that she does in fact have the map, and knows she must now go to Colombia to give it to the captors and save her sister. But when she gets off the airplane, and is to take the bus to Cartagena, where she's headed, she gets on the wrong bus and ends up in the jungle. A police officer that has been tracking her (and trashed her apartment) knows she has the map and tries to take the map from her, but just then, Jack Colton (Michael Douglas) shows up and chases the cop off. After that, the two team up to cross the jungle and get to Cartagena, meanwhile being pursued by Ralph (Danny DeVito), who works for the men holding Elaine hostage.This really is a great movie. It's funny, but not too much of comedy to ruin the action or the romance. Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas, and Danny DeVito are all very impressive in their roles, and DeVito is absolutely hysterical. The action and adventure is exciting, with enough shoot-outs, chase scenes, and more to keep anyone's attention.

Joan Wilder (Kathleen Turner) is one of those trashy romantic novelists and she secretly longs to be carried off into the sunset like one of her heroine's in her books.

Joan ends up having to travel to South America after her sister gets kidnapped by a couple of cons (One of them being Danny Devito in a great role) who want what is at the end of the map so therefore need the map which is in Joan's incapable naive hands.

Kathleen Turner stars as romance novelist Joan Wilder, a city girl who unintentionally finds herself stranded in the Colombian wilderness, miles away from modern communication and transportation. She encounters her opposite, a rugged outdoorsy soldier of fortune named Jack. Their clashing personalities are fun to watch. Of course, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom presented a similar relationship and did it better, but let's give Romancing the Stone credit for doing it first (by a few months). Good cast. Danny DeVito is especially entertaining. I liked how Joan's experiences transform her character. Good plot premise. But parts of the script are a bit sloppy. The story moves forward at a good pace, but the progress of the story relies too often on ""coincidences."" (Imagine if you read a Superman story where every time Superman is about to catch the bad guy, a piece of kryptonite falls from the sky and knocks him unconscious.)I was shocked that this film was nominated for best editing. In some getaway scenes, the editors apparently cut the part where the hiding party realizes that their pursuers have just arrived. The editors simply cut to the shot where the hiding party is attempting their escape. Fixing this problem would have extended the film's runtime by about 10 seconds. Also, there are some goofs involving stunt doubles, one of which could have been fixed by simply cutting the shot a second earlier.I was disappointed that we never learn the history of the treasure or the map. Nor do we learn how or why Elaine's husband acquired the map or why he was in Colombia in the first place.Despite its flaws, this movie is fun.

The comparisons to Indiana Jones are largely responsible for that. But if you watch it on its own level, it's highly entertaining. Danny DeVito is really very funny and Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner are solid in the lead roles. Actually, this may be my favorite as far as her work goes.
For all you who don't care what is said in a movie, ignore this part. But, I have to say that the language seems a bit to crude and harsh and overall excessive for a family film. Don't get me wrong, Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies, but it's not marketed for the family. This is, and although I think a little spicy language is fine in a ""family"" film, this just seems to go too far with that and some of the crude humor. This is just in case you are sensitive to that sort of thing when looking for a movie to show the kids.That being said, this movie works on every other level. It's one I crave to watch every now and then.*** out of ****",Romancing the Stone

134,northbonmot,Puffery,3,27 May 2020,"I have to wonder if other reviewers of this film consider what it means to deserve a nine or ten rating given the range of productions in all of film-dom. If RtS earns 10 stars, what do you give Citizen Kane or The Shawshank Redemption? Schindler's List? Gandhi? You get the idea. If someone is rating RtS anything higher than a six, I can only conclude that they are coming from a strict diet of prime-time network sit-coms and middle-of-the-road made-for-TV movies.The Stone is not the worst film ever made, nor is it unwatchable. I liked the cast but they were undercut by the writing. I thought the premise of the story was quite interesting and offered great possibilities, but again, the script didn't fulfill the promise of the premise. The story relied too heavily on outlandish circumstances and unlikely scenarios. A viewer can be expected to overlook some amount of incredulity, but there needs to be a payoff. RtS doesn't provide a payoff, just plodding and predictability at every turn. There's no real tension and certainly no doubt of the outcome, not only as to the overall ending, but even scene by scene.",Romancing the Stone

Watching it again recently, it seems filled with cliches that we have definitely tired of, but it is a classic romantic movie in its own sense and is best enjoyed with an open mind. The thrills that made it an infamous classic are still enjoyable, but for the modern viewer, needs to be taken with a pinch of salt.",Romancing the Stone

I would much rather if they left out certain scenes... (which aren't important anyway)and then just stuck with the adventure, so the whole family can watch it. But besides that, it's a very exiting movie with great comedy, drama, and suspense :) Anyone who wants to go to Columbia, might have second thoughts after watching this wild movie LOL.",Romancing the Stone

139,indigo7699,Adventure and love in the Columbian jungle,8,17 January 2003,"This is an adventure flick that's one hair away from being a chick flick--but a better genre-straddler you may never find. It's lifted out of pure romantic comedy rut by a young and feisty Michael Douglas playing a hard-bitten, coarse adventurer by name of Jack Colton and young, sultry Kathleen Turner playing naive New York romance novelist Joan Wilder. When Joan is stranded in the middle of the Columbian rainforest with a greedy and ruthless military leader, Colton chases him off, accidently playing the role of Joan's romance hero, Jessie. Chased across the country by thieves and corrupt government officials, Joan comes into her own, often getting out of sticky situations with her own talent for words when reluctant hero Jack would have shot his way out of things. Great movie... far better than any romance I've ever had the misfortune to read. Danny DeVito lends the film some of its funniest moments. One of my favorite films!",Romancing the Stone
140,RadicalDerickAndrews,The movie is like an old friend,7,6 June 2021,"One review is saying this is a film only for people nostalgic who lived in that time period. But I was born in the year 2000, and the movie fills me with the kinds of romance, adventure, and emotion, that is timeless. Part of the reason for this is the superb atmosphere. You really feel you are there in all of the locations. It is one of the most atmospheric movies you can watch. The other good thing about it: no pointless CGI. Everything made nowadays is just done on computers with CGI characters. It's never believable. Maybe we need to go back to how things were done in the past. Sets, matte paintings, and practical effects. CGI = no imagination.",Romancing the Stone
141,Arthur_Garden,"I gave this movie 9 stars out of a possible 10, a must see for all adventure enthusiasts",9,27 July 2002,"The storyline is somewhat hokey and the acting (on the surface anyway), appears second rate. This movie however is anything but second rate or hokey. It is highly reminiscent of the early Hollywood swashbuckler films. The amazing leading cast members, composed of Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny Devito, turned this into one of the all time great hidden gems. Turner and Douglas's on screen chemistry seemed both natural and hot. Danny Devito delivered the perfect comic relief, with his portrayal of inept kidnapper Ralph. Ralph and his cousin Ira, (Zack Norman) kidnap Elaine, (Mary Ellen Trainor) sister of renown romance novelist Joan Wilder, (Kathleen Turner). The object of their ransom is a mysterious package that had recently been mailed to Joan from Elaine's late husband Eduardo, (apparently just before he met with his hideous demise, which it would seem included some form of body dismemberment). The package turns out to be a treasure map, and the next thing you know, Joan Wilder finds herself on a madcap adventure in the jungles of Columbia. There was more offbeat comedy with drug lord Juan, (Alfonso Arau).I don't want to give away the whole movie, but the adventures are amazing, and everything comes together nicely in the end. I will leave you with one small bit of trivia. The girl who plays the part of the fictional Angelina also played the part of the dream girl in Ghostbusters. I won't tell you her name, but this would be a good time to put your IMBD to use.",Romancing the Stone
142,troyagain,Better than Raiders,7,5 December 2002,"Well, okay, *I* liked it better than Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Which, I guess, isn't saying much because I don't like the Indiana Jones movies all that much (but that's a whole other story).  So I'm not saying this is a perfect - or even excellent - movie, but it's pretty good.  Definitely underrated.  I gave it a solid 7/10.What'd I like?a) A love story I actually gave a damn about.b) Some growth in the characters (well, okay, Kathleen Turner's character anyway).c) Protagonists who are inept without being totally stupid.d) The humour.  I still love the whole ""swinging over the ravine"" sequences.e) The doubt as to whether or not Douglas' character would do the right thing.f) And, what the heck, I don't even mind the dated aspects that others despise (the hairstyles, clothes, music, etc.).What didn't I like?a) The slow beginning (but the ending was great).b) While much of bickering between Turner and Douglas worked, some of it felt too much like your typical ""arguing before falling in love"" crap.c) Some dialogue was entirely unnecessary (Devito's ""She got on the wrong bus,"" for instance).I suppose there are a couple other things I didn't care for, but I can't recall them right now.  Overall, good stuff.  But give the sequel, Jewel of the Nile, a miss.",Romancing the Stone

146,Mattyshay,Romancing is a romantic comedy,9,21 October 2006,"""Romancing the Stone"" is for the most part a fast paced romantic comedy. Kathleen Turner's character (Joan Wilder) goes from a quiet shy novelist to an adventurous risk-taker. While Michael Douglas' (Jack T. Colton) character turns out to be the good guy/prince-charming in opportunist's clothes. The adventure begins when ""Joan"" must go to Columbia to save her sister. She gets thrown off her intended path and ends up meeting ""Jack"". Who agrees to help ""Joan"" get to her destination, but for a price. Although he agrees to help her for the money ""Jack"" becomes fond of ""Joan"", but ""Joan"" is keeping a secret unsure if she can trust him. This secret as well as other factors make for an interesting plot. This is a great movie for viewing with friends or alone with your favorite snack. I really enjoyed this movie and I watch it every time it comes on cable (P.S. I have rented it more times then I can count also). If you like movies such as the ""Indiana Jones"" Trilogy and ""The Mummy"" & ""The Mummy Returns"", you will enjoy ""Romancing the Stone"". Once you see it you must see the sequel ""The Jewel of the Nile."" Happy Viewing! :o)P.S. It is not a rip off of the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy, the style is similar because of the action. However, the Indiana Jones trilogy usually has a supernatural element to it. The focus of ""Romancing the Stone"" is on the damsel in distress turned heroine and her interaction with the hero. As opposed to the other way around, in the ""Indiana"" movies the plot is focused on the hero/man.",Romancing the Stone

Danny Devito adds witt and comedy to every thing he says and the bad guys actually make it seem scary and real. And I don't know if they actually filmed it in Columbia but if they did it was worth every penny. You almost want to go hiking through the jungle with them.
