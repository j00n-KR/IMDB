0,bkoganbing,Price and value,7,31 March 2014,"The most notable thing about Indecent Proposal is the appearance of Robert Redford in a kind of villainous role. He's the man who makes the Indecent Proposal to Demi Moore to spend a night of nights. She and husband Woody Harrelson will get a really large sum of money, more than enough to take them out of financial quagmire they're in as a result of the boom of the Eighties souring off during the presidency of Bush 41.Back during the reign of Charles II and other monarchs in other countries were guilty of the same thing, Charles as we know had a voracious sexual appetite. Husbands regularly pushed their wives on to the King's attention in hopes of advancement. And Charles himself married off many a discarded mistress. The fabulously wealthy Redford no doubt sees himself with that same kind of power.But an example closer to Hollywood would involve the triangle of David O. Selznick, Jennifer Jones, and her first husband Robert Walker. When Selznick was smitten with Jones he never let the fact that she was already married deter him a bit. He courted her in a similar manner that Redford courts Moore. Who could resist and her this millionaire has the looks and charm of Robert Redford. What's someone like Harrelson to do?I'm sure the fact that he was not playing a good guy is what perked Redford's interest in this part. He does it well, but his public sure never wanted him in these kinds of roles.The three stars all do well in this film. Indecent Proposal asks some very disturbing questions about the price and value of human beings.",Indecent Proposal
1,SnoopyStyle,Very high priced cheese,3,13 April 2014,"Diana (Demi Moore) and David Murphy (Woody Harrelson) are high school sweethearts and married couples. He's an architect and she's a real estate agent. When a recession hit, the bank calls in their loan and they are set lose their home. They go to Vegas to win the needed cash. Diana catches the eye of billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford). At first they win, but eventually they lose it all. Gage starts to worm his way into their relationship ending up with the indecent proposal.The premise is all titillation and no drama. Moore and Harrelson play up the romance as best they could, but there is a lot of cheese in the style. I didn't care for the voice over narrations. Most of it was unnecessary. Director Adrian Lyne seems to do a lot of these sexually provocative movies. He does so sincerely that he's always in danger of a high cheese factor. Another major problem is that the movie's obvious premise forces the audience to wait for Redford's big question. It's very tiresome waiting for it, and it's tiresome to listen to discussions about it. Then there is the ick factor in the story. I'm not a prude but it's just annoying having Oliver Platt yammer on and on. Then Woody Harrelson turn on the jealous acting to full. The emotions from the couple rings all wrong. It's very melodramatic. The best thing here is the suave Robert Redford. He manages to do this character without blinking. That's real commitment to acting.",Indecent Proposal
2,Hitchcoc,It's Like That Party Game,6,3 January 2017,"The premise for this film reminded me of those party games...the ones where you need to answer a question that is controversial. For example, ""Would you give up a year of your life to live the rest of it in total luxury?"" This one, to a married couple, ""Would you allow your partner to sleep with another person for a million dollars?"" This is the stuff of parties, though. The fact that someone would have the means or the wish to make such an offer is quite unlikely. Redford is a gamer and so he goes ahead. The movie is about the answer to his proposal and the implications if the couple accepts. It's also a movie that probably has been discussed over and over in various settings. The acting is good (it's a good cast), but there is something so far fetched that I never bought into it.",Indecent Proposal
3,jboothmillard,Indecent Proposal,7,3 September 2008,"""Would you let your wife sleep with someone for one night for $1,000,000?"", that is the premise for this pretty immoral and thought provoking film, but that is what makes it good, from director Adrian Lyne (9½ Weeks, Fatal Attraction). Basically Diana (Demi Moore) - a real estate broker, and David Murphy (Woody Harrelson) - an architect, met and fell in love when they were teens, and against their parents wishes, they married. Now older they are finding it really hard to keep up with many debts, including the costs of building a dream house, and a night in Las Vegas costs them the chance to save themselves. Then along comes millionaire John Gage (Robert Redford) who seems nice giving them a good suite in the hotel, and buying a black dress for Diana. But then he makes them a proposition to not only help them out, but pretty much test their love, he offers them $1,000,000 for one night with Diana! Though they do agree to do it, agreed by the way with help of their lawyer Jeremy (Eraser's Oliver Platt), David does try to stop Diana from going, but she goes through with it (although you never see it). Afterwards Diana and David are slowly breaking apart with John somehow coming back into conversation, and unfortunately for Diana, John won't stop pestering her to help him with certain things, e.g. finding a new house. It is a bit of a weird ending, when you find out John has done the same thing to many other women, and thankfully, Diana and David do get back together, because they know they can't be without each other. Also starring Seymour Cassel as Mr. Shackleford, Billy Bob Thornton as Day Tripper, Rip Taylor as Mr. Langford, comedian Billy Connolly as Auction M.C. (i.e. himself and Sheena Easton. I think the only reason to say this film is really wrong is because Moore initially hates Redford, and then slowly they are like friends, at least Harrelson is more realistic, it may have won and been nominated some Razzies, but it is certainly a worth while film, if you can forget the immorality and concentrate on the three good leading actors. Very good!",Indecent Proposal
4,moonspinner55,"Too gentlemanly to be indecent, too sentimental to be much fun",5,29 June 2003,"Cotton candy involving a loving couple (bordering on good buddies) who lose their shirts in Las Vegas but get a chance to recoup when a world-famous billionaire makes a play for the wife--with booty attached! Great set-up for a story that takes a slow spiral downward once the couple returns home (to a rather lovely cottage in Southern California). Some sparks from principals Robert Redford and Demi Moore, but Woody Harrelson is out of his league and Adrian Lyne's direction is all visual and nothing much upstairs (and I could've done without the horse-racing video suddenly morphing into a shot of Demi in ""the act""). The film is shamefully enjoyable, and capped with teen-romance fever, but aren't these characters a little old for moony-eyed puppy love? ** from ****",Indecent Proposal
5,JohnHowardReid,Glossy But Empty,4,10 October 2012,"A glossy soap opera, complete with an unconvincing storyline, slick direction and actors who -- with one exception -- are obviously mimicking whatever incompetent instructions the director is throwing at them. By far the worst is Woody Harrelson. Admittedly, what his character is forced to do and say is stupid, illogical and downright ridiculous. But a really good actor, finding himself cast in this unbelievable shell of a role, would do something. Barrymore, for example, would really send it up; Mason would play it really tongue-in-cheek; Cooper would act against the role and deliver his lines frozen-faced. But Harrrelson does zilch. He acts it out as if the author was William Shakespeare, totally ignoring the fact that his character is always inconsistent, often motiveless, and sometimes absolutely ridiculous. Demi Moore does a little bit better, particularly when she gets away from the incompetent Harrelson, and is partnered by a real actor in Robert Redford. In fact, Redford is the only reason anyone would bother to see this movie. He brightens every scene in which he appears. And when he's forced to say something stupid, he smacks it across with a twinkle in his eye. That's what acting is all about -- not emoting like mad and running off at the mouth!",Indecent Proposal
6,sunwarrior13,Interesting Premise That Turns Into Disaster,7,13 December 2011,"Indecent Proposal is a film, based on the novel of the same name by Jack Engelhard about a handsome billionaire who offers a young couple $1 million to spend one night with his wife.It stars Robert Redford, Demi Moore, and Woody Harrelson.Adrian Lyne,the directs the film.In the storyline,Diana and David Murphy, high-school sweethearts who recently got married.They are doing very well -- Diana is a successful real-estate agent, and David is an idealistic architect who has built a dream house by the ocean -- until the recession hits. Suddenly, David loses his job, and they can't make the mortgage payments. Dead broke, they borrow $5000 from David's father and head to Las Vegas to try to win money to pay the mortgage on their house. At first, they get $25,000 ahead -- but inevitably the house always wins, and they end up losing it all. While Diana is in the fancy casino boutique trying to lift some candy, she is spotted by billionaire John Gage, who is immediately attracted to her. John invites Diana and David to an opulent party, and it is there that John offers David $1 million for a night with his wife. David is wrecked by this moral dilemma, but Diana finally makes the decision on her own, with ensuing consequences for their ideal marriage and their bank account.The film has an interesting premise.Unfortunately,it turns into a disaster especially after in the events after Diana agrees to sleep with billionaire,John Gage.Lyne's direction becomes formulaic and contrived.The romances between the young couple loses focus and the billionaire suddenly gives up in her interest to the attractive wife to give the story a happy ending.Too bad that the only positive note in the ludicrous but commercially successful movie is the solid performances from Redford,Moore and Harrelson.",Indecent Proposal
7,hitchcockthelegend,It's a tough sell.,6,12 March 2009,"An exceedingly rich business man offers a financially challenged couple the chance to solve their money worries, and in the process setting themselves up for life. His proposal?, one million dollars to sleep with the wife!.Is Indecent Proposal actually indecent itself?, coming from the director of Fatal Attraction (1987), Nine 1/2 Weeks (1986) and Unfaithful (2002), sexual tensions are again the order of the day. Tho derided by critics as a glossy moral poser, Indecent Proposal actually holds up well as an indictment of power, perfectly essayed by Robert Redford's billionaire play boy, John Gage. Gage makes his proposal and knows full well that he's putting strain on that relationship purely for his own gain, it's scheming of the highest order, with Redford superb in the role. Our tortured couple are played by Demi Moore and a surprisingly effective Woody Harrelson. The acting does at times struggle to cope with the quick shift to the twee triteness that is Indecent Proposal's biggest failing. It's not that we are asked to believe in an alternate universe where, Robert Redford has to pay for sex, and a goofy Woody Harrelson marries a sultry Demi Moore. It's that we are fed sweeteners after being served a decent appetiser about the complexities of love and all its devilish emotions. A bit more bravery in the script and Indecent Proposal could have been a very fine picture, sadly it remains a wasted opportunity. 6/10",Indecent Proposal
8,Theo Robertson,Great Premise But...,6,16 December 2005,"INDECENT PROPOSAL is a great example of a great premise for a movie - Would you allow your wife to sleep with a complete stranger for one million dollars ? and it's not too difficult to understand why this movie was so talked about on its initial release . Well would you ? The one problem that the movie suffers from is that Robert Redford was cast as John Gage , the middle aged billionaire who desires the company of Demi Moore's character Diane Murphy . Robert Redford who aged in his mid fifties looks about ten years younger and who still female fans to this day . One can't help thinking that Adrian Lyne would have been far better off exploiting the premise further by casting a much more physically repulsive actor as Gage . Some defenders may claim that Redford equals good box office and certainly this movie did superbly as far as world wide receipt's go , but it's a movie whose main selling point must be the simple central idea and would have perhaps ended up a much better film . It's interesting to note that when women in their late 30s to early 50s answer the question "" Would you ? "" they usually end up replying "" Robert Redford ! I'd go to bed with him for free "" . INDECENT PROPOSAL isn't a great movie despite the great premise and I found Lyne's directing style a bit too 1980s with a couple of scenes that are a bit too pop video for my liking but despite not being the greatest actors in the history of cinema both Moore and Woody Harrelson do enough to make the audience feel for their characters who find themselves in a dilemma . Yeah maybe it's Hollywood trash but it's engaging Hollywood trash",Indecent Proposal
9,grantss,"Interesting moral dilemma, and that's it",3,13 February 2016,"A happily-married, but down on luck and money, couple, David and Diana Murphy (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore), go to Las Vegas. There they hope their luck will change and their financial problems will be over. They meet a powerful billionaire, John Gage (Robert Redford), who makes them an offer - one million dollars for one night with Diana...An interesting moral dilemma, and that's it. The theme was intriguing - will they?, won't they?, what would you do? Unfortunately that's all it remains - a moral dilemma, and one that is not explored very thoroughly or very well.The remainder of the movie just feels like filler. There is a brief moment, in the aftermath of their decision, where the movie looks like it might go somewhere substantial, but this is just a false start. Ultimately, the movie has nothing to say. No substance, and what style there is is just pure schmaltz at its most trite.",Indecent Proposal
10,view_and_review,"So Repulsive, Yet So Compelling",7,18 April 2020,"This movie, like ""The Purge"", has a concept that I found so repulsive yet so compelling. Two things can be equally true. The idea of pimping out your wife, for any amount of money, is repulsive, but watching what unfolds when someone pimps out his wife is compelling.Who did what?Billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford) offered David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana Murphy (Demi Moore) $1M if he could have one night with Diana. They were on such financial hard times that this ""indecent proposal"" would be the answer to their economic dreams. It only started their marital nightmare.Hypothetically discussing a matter and actually living with that decision is two different things. Like many have said before, ""It sounded good at the time."" David instantly regretted agreeing to the proposal. Though they swore to never discuss it David couldn't leave the matter alone. And who could? He had the precise questions any self-respecting man would have:""What did you do?""""Did you enjoy it?""""Do you think about him?""There's no way a relationship can continue normally from that point forward. Whereas the woman may feel confident in her love of her husband and be able to move forward, in that respect she's holding all the cards. She knows what she did. She knows if she liked it or not. And she knows how deep her love is for her husband. Hubby, on the other hand, can only speculate, and speculation doesn't make for a strong, long-lasting relationship.""Indecent Proposal"" tested the theory of ""money can buy you anything."" Even though money got John Gage in the door, it was his persistence and his charm that got him further.""Indecent Proposal"" also tested the supposed unbreakable bond of love. So many love stories have love bringing people back to life, giving people supernatural strength, or being an impregnable force. In ""Indecent Proposal"" their bond was reduced to tatters. So, even though they may have still loved each other, the trust was gone. And like Tina said, ""What's love got to do with it?""",Indecent Proposal
11,gridoon2021,Glossy movie with Demi Moore at the apex of her beauty,7,5 March 2018,"Provocative premise receives stylish treatment from director Adrian Lyne; this film has a luxurious, almost sensuous texture, part of which comes from the ultra-glossy cinematography, and part from Demi Moore, who was at the time at the peak of her beauty and at the top of the world in her career (her hairstyle is amazing in this film). Oliver Platt, as the comic relief, gets in some funny lines. But the movie is not all surface - there is plenty of food for discussion in its themes, if one is so inclined. *** out of 4.",Indecent Proposal
12,HotToastyRag,Classic romance,7,25 September 2017,"Let's be honest, ladies; Indecent Proposal should have had a different title. Demi Moore is happily married to Woody Harrrelson. They have a great relationship and a great sex life, but they're poor. Then, millionaire Robert Redford offers Woody one million dollars for one night with his wife. Wouldn't it make more sense if the movie was titled Every Woman's Fantasy? This romantic drama is a pretty famous one, so if you're a fan of any of the three leads, or if you like classic romances, you'll want to add this to your list. It's great to watch with bottles of wine and your girlfriends, or with bottles of wine and your sweetie pie. It's incredibly steamy, and it'll give you plenty to talk about afterwards. I still haven't made up my mind whether I'd pick Bob or Woody! It's definitely a chick flick, though. I have yet to meet a man who actually liked this movie. Men can get surprisingly territorial once they're posed with the question of how much money they'd accept to let a gorgeous, handsome millionaire sleep with their wife. Go figure.",Indecent Proposal
13,The_Void,"Disappointing ""steamy"" romance",5,18 December 2005,"Despite a relatively intriguing premise, and a good first half; this steamy nineties romance-come-thriller falls flat on it's face in the second half, turning what could have been a great expose of love and money into a turgid sentiment packed drama, with little care for keeping it's plot or characters consistent. Throughout, the film impresses with mostly logical character actions; and this is what makes the film intriguing, but as soon as it loses that it ceases to be a film worth watching. The appearance of Billy Connolly in what can only be considered a bizarre cameo symbolises the fact that everything has gone wrong. The plot is so good because it directly pitches love and money against each other. The two have been joined lots of times, from The Beatles classic ""Can't Buy Me Love"" to the old saying ""money can't buy happiness"" - and this film works from the same means. We follow a young couple; who are happy, but have money troubles. After trying to gain some cash through gambling, a billionaire takes a liking to the female of the pair; and after finding out that she ""can't be bought"", he offers her $1 million...for one night with her.Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore take the leads roles. The male side of the spectrum is a rather bland role, and although Harrelson makes the best of it; there isn't a great deal of meat available. Demi Moore was hot stuff back in the nineties, and does her best at looking sexy in a subtle sort of way. To be honest, I don't find her all that attractive...but I'm probably in the minority with that. Robert Redford, who accurately portrays the snobbish millionaire with the indecent proposal, tops off the cast. Redford is despicable, yet also suave at the same time; thus carrying off both sides of his role to perfection. The fact that this film depicts a marriage break-up by a third party is always going to ensure a certain amount of sleaze. However, the film just doesn't get under the skin of this idea enough, and once the actual proposal itself has been made, a thick layer of sickly sentiment overtakes any sleaze that the movie may have; taking the intriguing plot with it. It's a shame that the film couldn't have made better of its ideas, but that's just the way it goes. Oh well.",Indecent Proposal
14,mm-39,Indecent movie,5,20 May 2004,"Ever watch a couple you know will never last.  Well that is how I felt about the couple in this movie.  Redford, was not likeable, and maybe none of the people where.  Movie makes you feel dirty watching it, just like the people should.  Chemisrty problem or just the idea is what I find wrong with this film.  Just another movie, with no feeling.  Like the one night stand in this film.  This movie's cold like 1 day cold KFC, but doesn't tast as good when you get that KFC out of the fridge for breakfast.  4 or 5 out of 10. Hey, order the chiken, but skip the movie.  My wife, hates the KFC, but I love it, Maybe get Kramer form that TV show to play Redford next time.",Indecent Proposal
15,Mr-Fusion,"An edgy, high-end mess",4,2 September 2014,"INDECENT PROPOSAL is one of those movies that pretty much spells itself out. You know what kind of provocative early '90s movie you're getting yourself into, and it doesn't take long to put the pieces together as to how things will turn out. Young couple needs money for their dream house, meets really rich guy who wants one night with the pretty wife. Five minutes' worth of deliberation ensues before they accept the offer and then it's the bad news of distrust, infighting and marital implosion from there. What makes this movie tough to swallow is . . . well, it's mostly the script. These aren't very sympathetic characters (c'mon, Harrelson, you have a wife that looks like that and you think you'll be okay after turning her out for a million bucks? Don't be an idiot!), and it makes their choices in the film's 1st act hard to stomach. Really think you're gonna net all the money you need in Vegas? Seriously! But the other reason is Robert Redford. He's all wrong for the part of absurdly rich and sociopathic John Gage, who buys other guys' wives like he does cigars and speedboats. The actions of this guy and the dialogue that comes out of his mouth are deplorable; but that doesn't suit Redford, whose boyish charm and likability runs completely counter to the character we're supposed to despise. Aside from Woody Harrelson's terrifically tortured performance in this movie, INDECENT PROPOSAL doesn't have much (if anything) to offer beyond the water-cooler appeal of its taboo hook: Would you let your wife spend a night with another man so you can pay your bills? It makes for a good five-minute discussion about morals (maybe), but it doesn't support a two-hour movie. It's hard to be mad at this movie when the cards are seemingly all on the table from the get-go, but it's still an aggravating two hours. Not a fan of any of these characters, even though I'm supposed to root for Harrelson and Moore (who looks stunning in this movie), and it just feels so trashy watching this thing. 4/10",Indecent Proposal
16,JamesHitchcock,Money Can Buy Me Love,5,15 February 2012,"A man goes into a bar and gets into a conversation with a woman. The topic turns to sex and he asks her ""Do you think that you would sleep with a man if he offered you a million pounds?"" After some consideration she replies ""Yes, I think I would"". ""So would you sleep with me for a fiver?""""Certainly not. What sort of girl do you think I am?""""We've already established that. All we're doing now is haggling over the price"". ""Indecent Proposal"" is a film loosely based upon that old joke. David and Diana Murphy are a married couple, the sort of people who at the time would have been described as yuppies. He is an architect, she a real estate broker, and both are living the Californian yuppie dream until the early nineties recession hits them hard. Hoping to recoup their finances they travel to Las Vegas, only to lose all of their savings. And here comes that joke. They meet a billionaire named John Gage who is attracted to the lovely Diana (hardly surprising, given that she is played by Demi Moore) and offers David one million dollars to spend a night with her. After much consideration, and after hiring their lawyer to draw up a contract, David and Diana decide to accept the offer, and Gage flies Diana to a private yacht where the dirty deed is consummated. Gage is as good as his word, and the money is duly paid into David's bank account, but the couple gradually realise that the arrangement has placed an intolerable strain on their relationship. This was one of a number of ""erotic dramas"" which came out in the late eighties and early nineties. (""Fatal Attraction"", also directed by Adrian Lyne, and ""Basic Instinct"" are others of the same kind). I call them ""erotic"" not in the sense that they are pornographic- ""Indecent Proposal"" only contains one, not very explicit, love scene- but in the sense that they deal frankly with sexual topics. In some respects the film can also be seen as a variation on the standard romantic comedy theme. Most romantic comedies tell the story of how a couple fall in love and of they overcome any obstacles to that love. ""Indecent Proposal"" tells the story of a couple who start off in love, of how they fall out of love, and of how their love is rekindled. The film was a box office success, but received mostly negative reviews from critics, and even won the ""Worst Picture"" Razzie award for 1993. This surprised me: ""Indecent Proposal"" is far from being a great film, but I cannot for the life of me see how it could be regarded as worse than Madonna's execrable semi-pornographic vanity project ""Body of Evidence"". (Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how any film not directed by Ed Wood could have been worse than ""Body of Evidence""). Of the film's three main stars, Moore is probably the best; although she is not as good as she had been in some of her other films from the early nineties such as ""Ghost"" and ""A Few Good Men"" she still succeeds in making Diana an attractive heroine. (There is also an amusing cameo from Oliver Platt as the Murphy's grasping lawyer). Woody Harrelson, however, is too stiff and awkward as David, not giving much expression to the emotional turmoil which a character in his position would have faced. My only objection to Harrelson's ""Worst Supporting Actor"" Razzie was that, as the film's principal male character, his was a leading role and he should have been nominated for ""Worst Actor"" instead. if Harrelson had been nominated for ""Worst Actor"", he would have had to compete for this dubious honour with his co-star Robert Redford. (In the event, Redford lost out to Burt Reynolds). Still displaying, in a slightly ravaged form, the good looks which had made him a matinée idol in the earlier part of his career, Redford's casting in the role of Gage drew numerous comments from women of a certain age along the lines of ""I would sleep with him for free, never mind a million dollars"". Unfortunately, this is one of his films in which Redford seems content to coast along on looks and smooth charm alone without putting much effort into his role. We never really find out what motivates Gage- love for Diana, lust for her or simply the desire to test, as an intellectual proposition, his theory that, the Beatles and popular opinion notwithstanding, money can indeed buy me love- although this may be as much the fault of the scriptwriter as of Redford. Although ""Indecent Proposal"" was intended as a serious treatment of its theme rather than a humorous one, the plot bears a certain resemblance to that of a comedy from the previous year, ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" in which an unsuccessful Las Vegas gambler loses his girl to a wealthy high roller and then has to win her back. This is, in fact, the sort of story which would have worked better as a comedy, its central idea being too improbable to be credible in the context of a serious drama. In real life billionaires, however eccentric, do not generally offer happily married women, however attractive, a million dollars for sex. It is not, in my view, an outstandingly bad film; Lyne is a reasonably competent director and tells his story efficiently enough. It is just not a very good one. 5/10",Indecent Proposal
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"$1,000,000? For a night with Robert Redford? For real? Where do I sign up?!",8,17 October 2005,"Wow, I am a little surprised by the rating. Only 5.3? Come on, this was a good movie! Was it the best? No, but it's better than most I have seen. If you were offered a million dollars, could the strength of your relationship survive it? I really got into this movie, because I knew how it would damage the couple's life. I think that they did deeply love each other, but they mention how they were childhood sweethearts, and kind of rushed into marriage. So, the point is, they've probably never been able to question if they had feelings for anyone else.Struggling financially is horrible. How far would you go to get some money? People will go the distance and sometimes take a front seat with the devil! ""Indecent Proposal"" goes all the way and shakes up human emotions.

18,OllieSuave-007,A pretty engaging story with a moral message attached to it.,8,4 October 2015,"Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson star as couple David and Diana Murphy, who are financially in trouble and in danger of losing their dream home. While on a trip to Las Vegas, they meet billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford), who offers them 1 million dollars in exchange for a one-night stand with Diana.This film was actually pretty good I thought - it kept me engaged and kept me wondering how the unpredictable plot would unfold at the end. The plot offers a moral message of the limits money can buy, and the old cliché that money really couldn't buy love. The acting also wasn't bad. Harrelson gave a thoughtful performance of a husband in financial and relationship troubles who strives to overcome his woes and pick up the pieces to move forward; Redford gave an eloquent portrayal of the invincible, but heartfelt billionaire; and Moore exhibited complexity and vulnerability in her character as she faces the choices she has to make between the two men.I have to admit the movie is mind-boggling at certain points, I mean, the thought of seeing a marriage torn apart of an out-of-this-world proposal, and the implications that resulted from it. And, there are some failed attempts at humor, at the expense of Oliver Platt's character. But overall, the movie has something we can all learn from and is, again, a pretty engaging story.Grade B",Indecent Proposal
19,Lejink,Don't watch this for a million dollars...,1,1 March 2009,"Notoriously provocative film made at the apex of the ""Greed is Good"" culture of the late 80's / early 90's and without doubt the worst film I've ever had the misfortune to watch.No doubt the director thought he was positing a high moral dilemma for adults but like today's version of the question which I've read more than once in celebrity interviews, which goes along the lines of ""For you to collect £50 million, one unknown person in China has to die"", the answer's a no-brainer and in any event totally inadequate to carry a movie. In any case, the point has been well-made before that to really hammer home the moral dilemma aspect, the Redford character should be a sleazy overweight balding slob and not a handsome, elegant Alpha male.Add to this! direction with all the high-gloss, no-depth style of an MTV rock video, the corniest dialogue this side of ""Pearl Harbour"" and plain bad acting and honestly if I could have marked a ""0"" I would. What possessed Robert Redford to take part I'll never know, although I'm likewise unsurprised by the appearance of the over-ubiquitous Woody Harrellson and sensation-fodder Demi Moore. And just what my fellow- Scot ex-pats Billy Connolly and Sheena Easton are doing in the background is anyone's guess!Redford sleepwalks his part like a latter-day re-run of Jay Gatsby, only without Fitzgerald's wonderful prose, Harrellson shows us the whole range of emotions from ""A"" to ""A"" (with thanks to Dorothy Parker) and Demi Moore gives another trademark drama-queen performance. I could add that I don't even get just what Redford sees in her mannish looks but to do that would suggest that the movie engaged me in some way.Well, it didn't, it couldn't and never would. This is a movie supposedly about the abuse of power and the desperate steps to which need can drive ""ordinary people"" with a tacked on love conquers all ending, but in the end it's just a cheap and nasty dissertation on the subjugation of women and another excuse for Demi Moore to get her kit off.Trust me, avoid this one at all costs.",Indecent Proposal

This is the titular ""Indecent Proposal"", on which millions of viewers, men and women, have been debating for years, placing themselves in the same tricky situation than David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana (Demi Moore), the ill-fated couple who met the devilishly sexy John Gage (Robert Redford) in Las Vegas. I remember when I was younger; there was a guy in my neighborhood who told me that in every woman, there was a potential prostitute. To confront him to his own contradictions, I carefully asked him whether that statement also applied to his family. The cynical macho nodded but felt the need to reformulate his thought, he meant that there was no woman in the world who wouldn't sleep with a man if she needed something, that's ""potential prostitution"" and I must confess I was almost convinced. And ""Indecent Proposal"" is all the more interesting because it confronts this option not to a woman, but a couple. The husband is part of the game and that's the strike of genius some distracted critics failed to grasp. Think about it: did Jack Engelheard, the author of the original novel of the same name, take for granted that a single woman wouldn't have thought twice before accepting the deal? I bet he did and I happen to think the same. Refusing wouldn't be honorable but stupid, and I'm sure many women would agree with me. We're speaking of one million dollars for a sumptuous night, and not with the ugliest man in the world. I bet when today's women visualize the myth of the Charming Prince, they rather picture Robert Redford (or Brad Pitt) as a billionaire than the nameless Princes of Disney classics. We'd all need money to achieve our dreams and selling one's soul for one night with one handsome rich guy and one million dollars isn't too high a price.But the film is cleverly provocative because it already admits the venal nature of women, which provoked the anger of feminists. But I'd love to see them in Diana's heels. The question isn't whether they would have accepted the night for one million, but how about two or ten, how high could John Gage raise the stakes before they'd say yes? That was the point and we got it, money can buy a body, but how about love? It all comes to David. And that's the subtlety the angry mob of feminists missed just like the intellectually eminent critics: the film also highlights the very hypocrisy of men who brand any woman who sleeps with other men as 'broad' or 'whore', by confronting them to the same situation. And I would have loved to ask the question to my macho friend, what if he was in David's place? Wouldn't there be, after all, in every husband or boyfriend, a ""potential pimp""?To answer that, watching the film isn't even necessary, it's all part of cinematic pop-culture, and we all have an opinion on the subject. In fact, if Adrian Lyne's film had one merit, it was to feature one of the most memorable premises of Cinema's history and handle it with a believable mix of realism and romanticism. It is crucial within the context of the film, because the theme is so sleazy it had to be washed up by a poignant love story. And on that level, the chemistry between Harrelson and Moore worked and built our empathy toward this couple of sweethearts, watching the ashes of their fantasy dreams gone with the wind of the 90's crisis. In many other films, that the husband is an architect and the wife a real estate agent would only be details, but they're pivotal factd in ""Indecent Proposal"".Indeed, after the bursting of the US housing bubble, there was no offer for Diana and no demand for David. Inevitably, their descent into poverty guide their hopes toward Las Vegas, an interesting setting where two worlds coexist: people who need money and can't afford losing, and those who've got enough to lose one million a night without even caring. The film even succeeds to make a brilliant social commentary, behind the appearance of a cheap soft-porn flick; it subtly denounces the pervert aspects of liberalism, where free trade is synonym of salvation at the expenses of principles, totally worthless when money is at stakes. And the world sunk into liberal lows so eagerly it ended up giving a price to anything, and people have been so effectively brainwashed by greed and lust they would look now, at the half-full glass. Isn't there one word to say 'crisis' and 'opportunity' in Chinese? I live in a country where many beautiful girls, students or salaried, go out with mature men, because they buy them things they can't afford. Basically, they use their charm as an asset to overcome material problems. It's certainly what lured my macho friend into his certitude. But when you take the plot to a larger scope, you realize it's less the selling-your- body dilemma than the eternal selling-the-soul-to-the-devil story, doing something morally wrong for a pay-off. Movies are made to provide some interesting 'what if' situations? What if we lived the same day again and again? What if we hadn't existed? ""Indecent Proposal"" is the ultimate 'what if' asker because this time, we can respond to the plot and relate to the protagonists, even more because we live in a similar economic context, and the world is crazy enough to feature such characters as John Gage. And Redford finds the perfect tone for his character: subtly obnoxious but always charming, one hell of a tempter!And I guess part of the fascination doesn't come from our relief not to be in David and Diana's shoes but from our regret. And that, my friends, is pure subversive brilliance!",Indecent Proposal
21,lesleyharris30,"The Performances are Good, but the Story is Weak,",5,9 June 2015,"Indecent Proposal is a mediocre movie with a poorly written storyline, but a terrific cast that manage to make it a little more bearable. The film boasts very impressive performances from Demi Moore, Robert Redford and Woody Harrelson, who made the best out of this mediocre script, I think the scenes between Moore and Harrelson are the best, they are very intense and it is very believable that they are husband and wife. The films story is very far fetched and the writers did a poor job of making it feel more realistic, it all felt like Diana was having a bad dream, it seemed very uninspired and was simply made because the book was obviously popular at the time. The character of John Gage is the weakest aspect of the movie, despite some stellar acting from Robert Redford, he is creepy and for the majority of the film we are suppose to look at it him as the villain, but later on they try and make us sympathise with his character, which I found had to do as he was impossible to relate to. It has it moments and it's not awful, but I still feel Indecent Proposal has too many flaws to recommend. A millionaire's financial offer makes a couple question their relationship strengths.

Strongly Recommended just to bash it and spread the negativity.,4,4 June 2020,"Indecent Proposal (1993) :Propose me One Million Dollars to like this film and I would still hate it. Strongly Recommended just to bash it and spread the negativity. Recently i have seen like 120+ films in last 2 months and i chose to watch only High rated films (from IMDb) so it was quite a long time that I haven't bashed a film badly. It's like my hands are itching to do it and now here i am, all set for to slaughter the deserving film Indecent proposal. I chose to watch this film just because of that shattering and stupid idea of 'One Million Dollar for One Night Stand"", well almost everyone watched it for the reason. I wasn't expecting a good film at all, i was hardly expecting average stuff. Now i just want to forget about acting, cinematography and direction of the film and this review is just about the writing. Because if the writing is bad then no film ever stands a chance so i will try to point out a few major mistakes (as there are 100 but i got no time for that) in the writing of the film.Let's begin with a brief story of Indecent Proposal. College time lovers David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana (Demi Moore) have now became a happily married couple and are in mad love but facing some financial issues. They encounter a billionaire John (Robert Redford) who is attracted by Diana and offers them a deal of 1 Million Dollar to spend a night with Diana. The couple accepts the offer and later it doesn't really bring any joy in thier life as David increasingly grows jealousy about Diana being attached to John even after that night so they are separated. Meanwhile John tries his chances with Diana and she begins an intimate affair with him and files divorce. David gives his approval to the divorce making Diana realise that she still loves him and they reconcile.Most of the critics, movie buffs and smart viewers gave up right after the scene when the couple accepts that absurd offer. But in my case it's different, i was somehow convinced by that scene and it went smoothly i mean it wasn't that much crap. But the real indecent and dumb story begins after that. Let me start with the most Dumb character, Diana. How the hell is she even thinking about going to sleep with an unknown man for the sake of money and then forget it easily? And what did she expect from her husband after mentioning that night's sexual intercourse as a 'Good Sex' whereas she was the one sho said it was just my body not soul? How the heck she expects her husband to continue thier married now? After being separated, she begins an intimate affair with the billionaire whom she hated and who has been the one and only reason for the burial of her happy married life. What rubbish? She herself files a divorce and when David approves it she suddenly realises that she still loves him. Keep the trash coming. Then she decides to go back to him with permission of John as if she was arrested by him or she was his slave. And she goes to the place where David proposed her assuming that he might accept her, well why didn't she go back to him before filing a divorce and before having an affair with John?Now coming to the male characters, firstly David. Okay so he gave his his nod to that ugly offer and let her wife sleep with the billionaire assuming that they would manage to forget the whole thing. Seriously? Such things can be forgotten so easily? He was supposed to leave Diana immediately after she tells him that, it was a 'Good Sex' and so he did.. but why mourning over recalling old memories when you have done the right thing? Then he had to go to see her one day just to see that she's happy with a rich guy while he's mourning. Then he had to to go see her again to approve ther divorce and tell her that he's sorry and the rich guy is better man for her. Are you kidding me? Sorry for what? For wife enjoying sex with another man or wife having affair? He was supposed to have some self respect, get over her and find a new life but instead he was crying like a baby sitting at the place where he proposed Diana and reconcile. Just show me one percent sense here. Now, the billionaire John, well he realises at the end that Diana will never love him as much as she loves David. He should have realised it before offering that One Night Deal because how on earth you can expect a married woman to love you as she does to her husband? And he says to her that, 'If you were mine, i would not share with you anybody' Tell me bro how can you say so when you are already getting a shared thing (as she is married). The biggest loop of the film those One Million Dollars. Neither David used it nor Diana. Well, they were so desperate for that money and it all happened because of that money, right? You should have rejected it before accepting the offer as you are anyways not using it later.Well i guess its better to have all 3 main characters dumb in the film rather than having only one to blame. That makes a perfect dumb and crap film made only for dumb people and the film was a box office success to prove that the bunch of dumb people is out there in big numbers. The fact is they went in to watch it because of that lousy tagline of One Million Dollar for one Night with yout wife. Most of them came out disappointed as expected and the film carries a reputation of being one of the worst film ever, well that sums up everything. Most of the people would ask you to skip this film but i recommend it strongly just to see how bad it is, bash it and spreads the word and if by any chance you like it then may god bless you kid.RATING - 4/10*By - #samthebestest",Indecent Proposal

The plot requires intense and meaningful performances by all actors involved. Woody Harrelson is here too, playing David, Demi's husband of 7 years.

The movie differed completely from the book(Not that the book was exactly a classic but it really was very good.)I guess Demi Moore was OK. Actually, I don't really remember to much about her performance one way or the other. However the big disappointment wasn't with Ms. Moore.WHY did whoever did the rewrite decide to suddenly make the millionaire have a heart? (I'm referring to him as ""the millionaire"" because he also had a different name in the movie then the book version-just another change.)People who didn't read the book obviously won't know anything's different but in the BOOK version this guy is much more ruthless as well as complex overall. He is also fascinating. The fact that such a big change was made in the movie alters the whole plot. It was almost like seeing a completely different movie.I know MANY movies vary widely from the books. But I also thought Redford's character was a bit of a wimp. This ISN'T Redford's fault(He's a great actor and could have played ruthless well) but without those qualities he becomes just another dazzled man in love hence the story becomes just another cliché love story involving 1 woman and 2 men. That wasn't really the point of the book.This could have been a lot better.

Gage decides to put the theory to test by proposing 1 million dollars for a night with her...An interesting premise for a lively dinner conversation due to formulaic plotting and a unbearably soapish love angle, turns into a cumbersomely dragging romantic snoozer with a mild level of tension build midway thanks more to the premise itself, then a sudden jump in quality. Not quite Golden Raspberry worthy ""An Indecent Proposal"" signifies a massive drop-off from Adrian Lyne after a surrealistically unnerving ""Jacob's Ladder"". Gimmicky to the extreme, with little fault especially to Robert Redford in his charmingly ruthless persona, the pretentionality hits hard especially during contrived banal voice-over narrations by Moore and Harrelson.

35,Howlin Wolf,Soul-less,3,22 February 2015,"(This is an extension of an earlier review that has been resubmitted)This film takes important questions such as ""What constitutes love for your partner?"" and ""How important is sex in a relationship?"", and treats them as glibly as if they were teledrama fodder. We never get the sense that director Lyne has pondered the issues inherent in his material; he has just gathered some nice shots and spliced them together in the hope that they will create an absorbing movie. It's not without entertainment on a superficial level, but this is generated more by how appallingly cliché the characters are than by any serious thematic exploration.The loving couple played by Harrelson and Moore never convince. Of the 3 principles, only Redford escapes from this with any credit; but even his performance lapses into something vaguely reminiscent of ""Swiss Tony"" from ""The Fast Show"" (""Gambling is like making love to a beautiful woman for a price of 1 million dollars..."")I wanted so much to like the movie, since I'm very interested in the sexual conventions of society, and how we each trade off with one another in order to find and cultivate a respectful and invigourating relationship... However, I don't think the movie explores any of that properly, despite providing an ideal launching pad for doing so.This is a gimmick movie that wants to ask its audience whether or not they would cheat on their partner with Robert Redford for a cool million bucks? (or Sharon Stone perhaps, to use an equivalent mid 90's sex symbol that would flip the issue... ) When you cast such sexual icons though, it immediately weakens the dilemma that's in play... It's relatively easy to assent to a Robert Redford or a Sharon Stone, because they represent a fantasy - and the film refuses to relinquish the notion of that fantasy for the duration of its entire running time. This has the effect of making it hard to play make-believe, when it comes to embracing the idea that serious ethical considerations are underfoot... Like the lucky coin in the movie, it's indicative of an already-done deal.I feel that, in terms of the story, as much moral importance should have been placed upon the DECISION itself, besides the rendering of its consequences being employed for sentimental manipulation.The route that the makers elected to take means that the project ends up playing out like a glossy, cheesy movie of the week, populated with several big names who were somehow unwittingly roped in... That's what some people like, I suppose, but in my opinion it seriously defaults on the complications that the initial premise should throw up... As I said, not completely without entertainment value, but only if you treat it as exploitative trash.",Indecent Proposal
36,baumer,Explores what love really means,8,12 August 1999,"Warning, may be some spoilersIndecent Proposal is a film that knows exactly how someone feels when it comes to jealousy.  There is a great line in the film after Demi Moore comes back from her encounter with gazillionaire Robert Redford.  Her husband, played perfectly by Woody Harlesson, is asking her questions that don't need to be answered.  Because if they are, it will put a damper in their marriage.  But he persists and finally Demi shouts out to him, "" If I tell you he wasn't any good then I'm a liar.  If I tell you that he was then I'm a whore. ""  What a brilliantly written line and it is one that lends a perfect ear to what the film is about in most senses.  Jealousy is a powerful emotion but being broke and in love is just as powerful on the other end of the scale.  What is so great about this film is that is makes us all question what we would do in that exact same situation.  Would you let your wife sleep with a man for one million dollars?  Could you look at it and say that it was only one night and you can deal with it?  Would you say that your marriage is strong enough to overcome something so meaningless?  And that is the key issue right there.  Is it really that meaningless?  If you are married and in love ( if you are together in a monogamous relationship), is there ever a time when sex is meaningless enough to overlook, even if all of your financial problems are solved in the aftermath?Indecent Proposal is a great film in almost every sense.  The actors are great, especially Oliver Platt who has a cameo as their lawyer and he gets all the laughs.  The direction is great as it never gets anywhere close to pornographic, and it lets the audience decide for themselves what happened on that fateful night.  When you look at the whole concept of the film, you know it could get cheesy if handled poorly and irresponcibly.  But it never does.  It stays on course and delivers the goods.  I highly recommend this film and I think it is good to watch it with someone that you love.  It will invoke some very interesting conversations after words.

Basically the story boils down to the question, ""would you let your wife sleep with another man for one million dollars?"" Here of course the answer is yes because otherwise we wouldn't have a movie. Quite frankly, we'd have been better off if we didn't have a movie.Our married (and financially troubled) couple are played by Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. They go to Vegas to get rich. Yeah, that'll work. Anyhow, a billionaire, played by Robert Redford, takes a liking to the wife and makes the million dollar offer. For one night with the wife he will give them financial security. The aftermath of that one night is what the movie is really all about. Unfortunately nothing in that aftermath is the least bit entertaining. The script is so predictable you can say the characters' lines before they do. The performances leave much to be desired. Harrelson would be better off sticking to comedies as this attempt at serious acting completely misses the mark. Anguish is not something he seems capable of portraying. And it is quite safe to say that Demi Moore will never have to clear space in her home for any Academy Awards. Why is she a movie star again? In a part that should be full of emotion she conveys none. Only Redford escapes mostly unscathed. He's appropriately slimy yet suave and clearly the best actor of the bunch.

He and his wife Diana travel to Las Vegas to win some money to cover their debts. Billionaire John Gage offers the couple one million dollars if he can spend the night with Diana.Based on Jack Engelhard's novel, Indecent Proposal covers the wants and needs of relationships and what couples need to do to survive.This idea of buying people, although quite crude, is well established and portrayed in this romantic drama by director Adrian Lyne.Though Robert Redford's (The Sting) character and acting isn't brilliant he does what he needs to do to dive right into the couple and exploit their problems. Harrelson and Moore (Disclosure) are both brilliant in their roles as the confused but loved up couple.The whole idea of buying people for sex is horrible in my opinion but the film specifically portrays the crisis that the couple are in and the viewers will comprehend the decision which is eventually made.Its quite a hard going film considering the financial obligations and the emotions involved. There are a few clichéd love ideologies thrown in to portray the closeness of the couple.David's whole idea on archaeology was very intriguing and was a cool little sub story to look upon.Its tense and dramatic at various points though fairly predictable and corny at others.

40,TOMASBBloodhound,Sappy and predictable,4,28 August 2005,"Indecent Proposal is all premise and no execution. The film exists only to give people something hypothetical to talk about over dinner or drinks once it is over. There is nothing redeeming either in the acting or technical departments to raise the material above the level of soap opera. The plot, as most people know, centers around a wealthy business tycoon (Redford) offering a young couple (Moore and Harrelson) $1,000,000 if she agrees to sleep with him one night. Obviously, they agree to the offer or this film would have never been made.The main problem stems from the fact that there isn't enough story here for an entire movie. Once the bet is agreed to and worked out, where do we go with it? The writers turn the film into a ridiculously sappy flood of emotions and over-acting that can only end in the most predictable way. It doesn't take a genius to see where the script is going to end up.The acting is part of the problem, as well. Redford probably thinks his performance is suave and charming, but a better word would be just ""smug"". There is nothing about his character that is likable or even interesting. I doubt his character was supposed to be likable, but I'm sure he wasn't supposed to come off as wooden as he does. Demi Moore is fine as the young woman. And physically she's as adorable as ever. What a babe! Harrelson, however, is so unbelievably awful that I feel truly embarrassed for him whenever this film comes on. He's a whining; jealous jerk who should have stopped the whole thing from happening if his wife meant that much to him. His performance is nothing short of ""grating"".The film made a ton of $$$$, so who am I to criticize it? Just some sap who was duped into taking his girlfriend to it way back in 1993. At least I scored when we got home. So I guess there was one redeeming quality about this sap fest.The Hound will give it 4 of 10 stars. That's more than generous.",Indecent Proposal

A Few Good Men, this, and Disclosure stand out as Demi Moore at her sweetest and just absolute hottest and factual evidence of it can be found in this, Indecent Proposal, as we see beautiful Moore at her most epic and most beautiful and most primal and best and looking so damn good, God! Demi Moore's the hottest woman ever created. She's in her beautiful prime, her physical prime, her sexual prime, her hot body in white underwear rolling around, laying on the bed surrounded by cash with Woody looking super intense prime, or at least on the very verge of it. She's around 30 years of age.

Indecent Proposal's one of my very most fond films. When I see sexy Demi in her red lipstick and her long elegant dress on the yacht I get the chills, grow a fever, and immediately fall in love. You can't blame me or Robert Redford or all those guys on Demi's sets but I do Woody.

43,nicholas.rhodes,Doutbful premise but very good film,8,28 August 2006,"In the case of this film, I make the difference between my own views on the moral issues involved and the quality of the film itself. Morally of course, it is all very reprehensible, you cannot sell your wife for a quick lay, even if there is a lot of money involved. I am sure this idea will have shocked 80 percent of the world, even though in the USA, and even worse in Europe, being unfaithful in a marriage is no longer considered a sin. Also, money is shown as opening the doors to everything, which is also morally wrong. Money is a tool which is supposed to enable people to live their daily lives but in excess it is obviously bad - just look at the whims of millionnaires ! The same may be applied to excesses of eating, drinking and smoking. Abuse all these and you will suffer! That apart, the film was actually very entertaining to watch. Notably, photography, lighting and music score were excellent. I am no particular fan either of Redford or of Demi Moore but both gave excellent performances. I was amazed by one or two plot inconsistencies ... we don't know whether Demi Moore left Redford because of the story he made up in the car or whether really she had second thoughts about her divorce proceedings. It is not clear. When she goes and sits on that misty jetty at the end, I found it an incredible coincidence that her husband just happened to be sitting there in the other seat on the same day at the same time. It just doesn't seem plausible and I supposed it was just put in to make the ending happy. That said, I like films with happy endings ... I don't like the cynics who want films to have sad endings under the pretext of it being more realistic. Its just a ploy to be different from other people which doesn't have any grounds. So I was most pleased by the ending, even if the artifice used to lead us to it seems a bit far-fetched. I am absolutely amazed to read in the comments here that "" most women would sleep with Robert Redford for free, let alone a million dollars "". Who are these women ? The local gang of prostitutes ? Don't they have any self-respect, or is it just readers trying to be provocative ? I am shocked to hear this sort of thing, as if it was something banal, inevitable and to be expected. Robert REdford is just a man like anyone else. Why are people turning him into some kind of God ????

David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana (Demi Moore) are the perfect couple who promise each other eternal love till the day comes that they're bankrupt. David decides to go to Las Vegas hoping for getting the needed money but all ends in a financial fiasco till multimillionaire John Cage (Robert Redford) proposes the couple to give them one million dollar if he might spend one night with his wife... I am sure that every couple will ask this dilemma (""Would you do it or not?"") the moment they saw the film and you can bet your ass that Robert Redford is the focal discussion...for women a dream for men he's just too pretty. If this film is realistic or not is an unnecessary thing, it's just that during the whole movie you feel so bad for Woody Harrelson that you are hoping to punch your fist in Robert Redford's face... The characters aren't bad and Demi Moore plays her role more than well (she's at her beautiest here!) but just the end is a bit too Hollywoodesque...

48,zfiany,Very controversial and probably not commonly understood by viewers!,7,15 October 2009,"First, I like the movie just to debate it with friends but definitely not a movie to watch twice. It's a decent movie though indecent proposal but the message is quite there in the ending and there are no other depths that call you watch it more than once.Second, the movie appealed to me being a Middle Eastern and girls in my environment shouldn't even think of sexual relationships out of wedlock so let alone selling your body for money! Therefore, the whole story revolved around the weak character that Demi Moore played. Her character was so weak rather than in love. She couldn't say no to selling her body not to mention that the movie even went beyond the money appeal to reach the fact that women, even when they are in love, and unlike what men think of them, they can still be attracted to other guys just like them. One cannot deny that Robert Reford charmed her and the overall sexual experience with him wasn't that repulsive to her. She kind of fell in love with him but in a different way than that with Woody Harleson. The guy not only represented money to her but also changed her character from weak and unconfident girl who was indebted to her lover out of lack of selfconfidence to the strong confident lady who chose to go back to her lover at the end but after teaching him a lesson.I don't respect her character in any possible way in the movie and I think of her as a quitter and so flimsy but she represents a rich character of emotions and a good substance to study and analyse psychologically. The movie all in all as I find appeal more to ladies than to men because there was nothing manly about the movie but the gambling part and that doesn't even count. However, men should watch this movie and think about many of its aspects as in would they reach a limit to sell their women partners for money and what do they think in general of a character such as the one played by Demi in this movie.",Indecent Proposal
49,cashbacher,The power of money over the desperate,10,29 August 2019,"When this movie came out, there were many people that derided the plot device of a man offering a married couple a million dollars for a night with the wife. Their claim was that it was immoral and truly indecent. That is too bad, for it misses the real messages of the movie.
First and foremost, this movie is about the power that money gives the rich over those that are down on their luck and are desperate. They are willing to grasp at any chance they have to right their errant financial ship. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson play Diana and David Murphy, a married couple that go to Las Vegas with their last stake in the hope that they will win big enough to pay themselves out of their financial hole. When this doesn't work, John Gage (Robert Redford) offers them a million dollars for a night of passion with Diana. After a reality gut-check, the couple agrees to the proposal.
Tensions mount between the couple afterwards and the course of their relationship sours. It becomes a test of what they believe about each other and how they will weather the emotional consequences of selling out. In the end, the movie becomes a complicated love story.
Mao Zedong famously said, ""Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."" What this movie illustrates is that all power grows out of the pile of cash available. When people are down and desperate, the person that can offer massive amounts of money has the power. After all, there must be a way for those seeking power to pay for the guns and ammunition.",Indecent Proposal

I'm sure people will talk more about the proposal itself than the feature film, and that does not really make a favor to the film. This only leads to a conclusion that the film should have been better, and it should perhaps have taught us something more. The couple in the film do consider the proposal, for approving this deal would remove their acute need of money, but neither of the couple doesn't really look too smart to make the best decision.It looks interesting in the beginning but then it does, really nothing. Demi Moore looks gorgeous at least but the point also is lost too quickly, perhaps it is because Robert Redford looks better than the husband who's only angry all the time and doesn't even dress well.

Robert Redford was the only one decent enough to watch in the movie, I was even able to find some goofs and the only few laughable moments are again with Robert Redford, who is this perfect, handsome billionaire John Gage, any woman who has two eyes and a functioning brain would stick with him instead of a loser like David played by Woody Harrelson. I still can't understand why John would find Diana attractive, Demi Moore plays  her role well yet it could have been done better. I gave this movie a 6 due mainly to the charm of Redford.

54,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,An erotic thriller and morality tale,8,12 October 2013,"(SPOILER IN THE SEVENTH PARAGRAPH- THAT'S THE SECOND TO LAST PARAGRAPH. THE REST DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS SO PLEASE READ!) The film has one of the best premises of any film: would you sleep with a stranger for a million dollars? We've all jokily posited the dilemma, with some people answering 'yes' with more than a hint of bravado and most people emphatically taking the moral high ground by answering 'no'. But what if you were broke and the stranger was Robert Redford?The film starts off brilliantly, with the suspense of an erotic thriller turned up to the maximum as we anticipate the moment where Redford will make the offer and everyone's lives will be changed. Underneath all that glossy porn, director Adrian Lyne also makes some social commentary, believe it or not. Money and wealth is given an erotic charge as Demi Moore's character Diana lusts after a gorgeous black dress. It's way out of her price range and symbolises the wealthy lifestyle that she secretly desires. Most viewers at one time or another will have yearned after an object with a price tag they can never afford, not so much because of the object itself but of what it symbolises. You imagine that this object- a symbol of wealth- will make you more attractive, more confident, more authoritative. This is a universal truth that every advertiser plays on and indeed Hollywood plays on.The climax of this exploration of money as sex is when Diana and John (Woody Harrelson) have just won £10,000 at a casino. They throw the notes onto the bed and then themselves. Each glossily voyeuristic shot of the couple unites their sex with the money, as the notes press against backs, thighs, etc. But this is of course small change compared to what Robert Redford's character, handsome billionaire John Gage, is offering.Reviewers who argue that the film would be more credible if the filmmakers had picked someone more unattractive are completely missing the point. Gage is the embodiment of the erotic lure of wealth. If he was hideous, the million dollars would look much less alluring and it would simply become a question of how far someone would go to pay the bills. An unattractive billionaire would also be much less of a threat; Diana would simply do the deed, get out of there and live a life of wealth with John. If she did choose to stay with the ugly billionaire, the film would just become a tale about an unpleasant person who betrays her loving husband for money.The extra tension is that David feels sexually threatened by Gage. As he walks past a television shop, he imagines that the screens are showing his wife at it with Gage. So as well as the theme of the sexualisation of money, you also have questions of masculinity. What makes a man a man? (no giggling at the back please) Inevitably the film slows a little in the second half once the decision is made. It shifts gears so the question changes from ""Would you sleep with a stranger for a million dollars?"" to ""In a loving marriage, would you be able to/should you forgive a betrayal?"". This too is an interesting question, though less entertaining.Lyne makes the ending very moral and conventional, upholding the sacred vows of marriage by Diana repenting and John forgiving. However there is a degree of ambiguity as what wins Diana over is a romantic gesture enabled by wealth. Some might see it as signifying that personal history will triumph over money, but without the money required to make the gesture, would Diana have gone back to John? I would normally rate it 6 or 7 as I feel that the initial theme of the sexual power of money could have been explored more deeply, and that the ending is a bit weak. However the IMDb score is too low for what is a piece of glossy entertainment that touches on provocative issues. Maybe the film raises an uncomfortable question that we'd rather repress: is there a price at which we can all be bought? More specifically, what price can you be bought at?",Indecent Proposal

56,Bevan - #4,Copout,5,10 April 2005,"For the most part, this is a good movie. It has some very splendid bits of cinematography -- the bit where Harrelson's character is standing amidst a backdrop of TV screens, which suddenly in his mind's eye displays his wife, is very evocative. The characterizations are sound, for the most part, and the film avoids some obvious clichés ... take, for instance, Harrelson's drunken punch at Redford, which *doesn't* connect. The titillation you would have expected from the horrified rantings (adultery! prostitution! sin!) at the time of the film's release didn't actually appear -- Moore's and Redford's characters scarcely embrace, let alone are seen in bed.The worst cliché that comes about is the last ten minutes of the movie, though, which inexplicably ditches two hours of characterization for the copout happy-ending-after-all that the Moral Majority and Lifetime crowds would appreciate. The film would have rung a truer tone if it had stayed its course, and demonstrated that actions have consequences you just can't slough off with a familiar catchphrase. It produced a sour note in what was otherwise an interesting exploration of human relationships.5/10.",Indecent Proposal
57,spenrh,This is not a very good movie,3,20 January 2021,"I am definitely curious on why Robert Redford accepted a role like this. I wouldn't be surprised if the producers offered him $1 million just to appear in it.He's a real slimeball in this role who unhealthily obsesses over a woman he just saw for the first time. It doesn't matter how rich or successful you are, when you offer a stranger $1 million dollar for sex and totally drool and obsess over her, you are a scumbag, particularly if the woman makes it clear from the start how uncomfortable he's making her, which Demi Moore certainly does right off. ""The dress is for sale, I'm not"" is one of the first lines from her to Redford after his first of many lengthy oogles at her, and him immediately offering to buy her a $5,000 dress.Demi and Woody Harrelson, on a Vegas trip in order to try to rack up some much needed dough to try and get themselves out of deep debt, encounter Redford at a card table (and Demi's 2nd encounter with him). From there, he offers to ""borrow"" her from Woody as a ""good luck charm"" to make his card bets, he then sends them an invitation to his private party in his penthouse, and then at the party makes his $1 million offer to Demi. Redford tries to make the excuse that he's only asking hypothetically, but Woody and Demi aren't stupid.On second thought, they are kinda stupid. Woody and Demi have fairly understandable and down to earth reactions to their problems early on in the movie, but they then begin acting stupid numerous times as the movie progresses. And the plot gets dumber more into the movie too. After Redfords offer about the one night for one million, Demi starts considering maybe going for it, and Woody is actually not completely against it either and consideres allowing it too. They then get their lawyer involved who then makes up a formal legal contract for them each to sign, which at least supposedly would make the ordeal assuring enough so that Demi would return back to Woody after that night, they would get their $1 million, and the whole ordeal would officially be done with. And Woody kisses Demi goodbye for the night, leaving us seeing that he understands and it's all settled. But this is where things get stupider, just a short while later while having a drink with his lawyer, Woody suddenly freaks out hysterically and runs frantically up to the hotel roof screaming after Redford and Demi's departing helicopter! If this is his reaction, why the hell did he agree with it to Demi, discuss it with his lawyer, sign the legal papers, etc.!? I totally understand a husband reacting like that if he felt that way all along or if something like this was done deceptively behind his back, but this here the way they showed it just didn't make sense.Then after the night with Redford and Demi is over, and her and Woody reunite, alot of other stupid things happen. In spite of all the legal papers, etc., Redford then slyly takes Demi and Woody's house away from them? How would he have even pulled that off? And when did he have the time, didn't Demi and Woody go back home almost immediately after her night with Redford?Then numerous times throughout the rest of the movie, Redford just basically keeps stalking Demi! He shows up at her work, he shows up at a Spanish English class she teaches, he lures her to his elaborate mansion. His obsession with her is so creepy and stalky. And then the ending of this movie is too far out to be believable. I mean, I thought this was an interesting idea for a movie when it first came out when I was in highschool (but only saw the trailers for it then). But after later seeing the whole movie, I realized it's just not a good movie.",Indecent Proposal
58,ecjones1951,A lost opportunity,6,29 June 2008,"I've always had problems with the title. The word ""indecent"" means immodest, obscene; unfit for society. When used these days, the word is almost invariably followed by ""exposure."" ""Audacious Proposal"" would have made more sense.The premise is well-known by now, and presents opportunities to muse about the relevance of marital fidelity, personal scruples, and the seductive and emotional power of money, but it sidesteps, muddies or ignores every one of them. It could have addressed any or all of them and still be entertaining and a conversation starter.Billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford) offers one million dollars to a struggling couple, Diana and David Murphy (Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson), if he can sleep with her for one night. The proposal is intrepid, adventurous and bold, but it is not indecent. Diana accepts the offer and follows through with the assignation, all the while reminding David that she is doing it for him, to further his career as an architect. I suppose her oft-repeated declaration is meant to show us that yes Diana does too have scruples. See? she can call upon them whenever she wants to.Diana's tight-lipped and blithe insouciance once the tryst is history and the money is in the bank drives David out of his mind. Director Adrian Lyne wisely keeps Diana's and Gage's night on the yacht out of camera range. (Seeing the hideous gray dress he asks her to wear is enough.) It's too bad he didn't do the same with David's petulance, self-pity and masochism, which overshadows everything else in the second act. David is supposed to be a bright and promising architect whose marriage to Diana is solid as a rock. Of course, the only way we know this is through a lightning fast exposition of their courtship and marriage, told mostly through photos shot with a lens metaphorically coated in Vaseline. In ""Love Story,"" Jenny reminded Oliver many times that ""love means never having to say you're sorry."" These two like to ask each other the equally inane, ""have I ever told you that I love you?"" When Demi Moore gives the best performance in a movie, that's saying something. Although Diana is an underwritten role, the character isn't maddeningly one-note like those of David and Gage. She is two-dimensional, which is as fleshed out as any Lyne character ever gets. Lyne is no more secure in his leading lady's acting abilities than most other directors, so he gives her the expected opportunities to show some skin. Sketchy roles never seem to allow Moore any freedom; she tends to hem herself in. But someone has to restrain themselves in the aftermath of Diana's night on the yacht. As noted, David has gone to pieces with rage and jealousy. Diana cannot deal with his meltdown; his suspicions, leading questions and accusations drive her away. Meanwhile, John Gage is waiting for Diana around every corner. He is essentially stalking her, but his behavior is supposed to come off as charming. When she, on the other hand -- with good reason -- crashes one of Gage's business luncheons, it's cause for alarm; Diana's behavior is ""inappropriate"" and unacceptable. This is a double standard Hollywood reinforces over and over again. But soon Diana puts up only token resistance to Gage's pursuit. She didn't when he offered her and David that lifetime of financial security with but one little catch.Diana eventually caves in, and she and Gage get busy making the social rounds. What they find to talk about is anyone's guess, but Moore and Redford do make for an attractive couple. The passage of time is indicated by David and Diana's both getting teaching jobs. He teaches architecture and suggests bricks are blessed with self-determination. I told you he went nuts after Diana slept with Gage. For her part, Diana teaches U.S. citizenship. Her pupils, all well into adulthood, giggle like 8-year-olds when Gage crashes the class to declare he's crazy about Diana. Even though she has divorced David, her days with Gage as an item at gala openings and silly charity functions are numbered. The time comes for Diana to go back to David, having learned what, exactly? ""Have I ever told you I loved you?"" ""Would we have been able to handle the million bucks any better if we'd earned it?"" The credits roll before they begin to figure this out.I want scriptwriters to STOP recycling Mr. Bernstein's anecdote about the girl on the Jersey ferry from ""Citizen Kane."" Gage gets to give that little speech here, adapted for modern times. The problem is, the conclusion he wants Diana to draw from it is exactly the opposite of what he says.""Indecent"" describes the amount of money the picture took in at the box office -- about $199,000.000 more worldwide than Gage offers the Murphys. If this is Lyne's idea of a ""message picture,"" as they used to call them, he should have used FedEx.It's much more fun to write about a middling movie than a great one or even a very bad one.",Indecent Proposal

Mr. Redford is a personal hero of mine, instead of resting in his laurels, Sundance, the environment, Ordinary People, Quiz Show and so on and so on. But, I heard him say in a Charlie Rose interview that he would like to play different characters, dangerous, dark but nobody offered him that kind of part. What about this one Bob? This was a part that could transform this pretty candy floss into a classic. It needed guts. Where was the darkness? I looked into Redford eyes and I saw Redford. I would have gone with him for much less than a million bucks because in spite of the fact that involved accepting an indecent proposal there was no danger, really. He allows himself to be Redford all the way. The indecency is in the title in the gimmick but not in the spirit.

60,jefadlm-1,Indecent Proposal,4,29 July 2012,"No I did not read the book. I note here that all the reviews I ticked made valid points good, bad and indifferent. It was predictable and annoying in its attempt to keep the plot going. As an audience we did not need to stay alert as the thing dragged some and did not hold sufficient true interest in Redford and his unfortunate casting, which as others have said was not the man for the job. Quite annoying that he was benign and predictable. As was the rather facile direction. I am trying my best to avoid spoilers. In short, the previous reviews to mine, in my opinion are accurate. In future I think I will avoid sitting through an entire Mr Lyne movie. I have learned enough about his style to be more discerning in future. Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson are truly excellent with what may have been a tough contractual movie to star in. They both come across very well and in no way need to feel anything but proud of their performances.Well done and good luck to them both. I think Redford is an amazing actor, in this he is woefully mis-cast and weakly directed.",Indecent Proposal

62,oliver-123,Impossibly romantic and sentimental ending,6,11 January 2006,"I watched this, taped off TV, because I found the basic idea interesting. It was acted out well, though I agree with the reviewer who said that Redford just didn't have enough of the devil about him. I thought it was particularly clever not to show John Gage (Redford) making love with Diana (Moore), though there had been plenty of scenes with her and David (Harrelson). To judge from another comment, the book would have been far more interesting, as a picture of John Gage and the repercussions of what was done. In fact, there are deep contradictions in how John Gage is portrayed. He is at first amoral enough to be ready to threaten the marriage of a young couple just to get a night with Diana. Then he becomes obsessed with her, behaving as if he's fallen truly in love, and for a while, after David walks out (apparently; it is not altogether clear), Diana seems to respond to this and be in love with him (but this too is not made clear. She could have decided to be his mistress, with no depth of emotion at all, for all we are told). Then, on seeing the interaction between David and Diana, when the former comes to sign the divorce papers, he makes a quixotic gesture and deliberately cheapens himself in Diana's eyes, by making clear how often he has played the million dollars ploy, so that she will go back to David, which she duly does, and they re-connect. It is hard to believe that one man could go through so many changes of heart, or even that Diana, if she has come to love him, could so easily go back to David, who hurt her badly enough with his mistrust that she was ready to contemplate getting involved with Gage, whom she had fended off before. There are minor glitches that irritate, such as how the couple pay off their debts etc. if the million dollars remains intact, and how Diana gets a bus at the end without apparently having a cent on her (she is not carrying a purse), but the contradictions in Gage's character seem to me to be the central flaw, and I don't believe the couple could resolve their differences and come back together as easily as all that.",Indecent Proposal

64,folkpoet80,Very Moving,8,17 December 2004,I can't believe the comments that IMDb has featured. The user seems like a high school drop-out with no sense for a good movie. The whole movie was moving with Woody Harrelson over-shadowing everyone else. Demi Moore was alright and Redford steals the lime-light when he recalls the train incident from 30 years ago. I think the main scoring point of the movie was when Woody comes to meet Demi and Redford at the end of the movie. Those 10 minutes of the movie were the best and make their make their mark undoubtedly. The song by Roy Orbison at the end was powerful to the movie. Soundtrack was superb!! I highly recommend this movie!!!!,Indecent Proposal
65,AudemarsPiguet,Is Redford copying his part as Gatsby?,6,6 March 2005,"This Hollywood-love story seemed to me as a somewhat tasteless copy of Gatsby set in our days.Did someone notice the striking similarity between John Gage,the sinfully seductive billionaire from this film,and Redford's earlier character Gatsby? Up to the encounter with this character the film seemed fairly well-done,yet uninteresting.It is how about a woman(Demi Moore) met the man of her life(Woody Harrelson)and how they plan to live together in an idyllic marriage,have kids and you can guess the rest. But as such respectable outcome would have made this film utterly event less,disaster strikes shortly after they exchanged wows,being hard up for money they head to Vegas in order to save the family's budget and,as expected,end up broke. This is the moment when destiny is giving them a chance in a strange way-they meet mysterious John Gage,billionaire and single,who just witnessed how they lost their last money. And as money can buy everything,he is about to strike a deal with them-would the husband lend his wife to him for night only in exchange of one million crisp,freshly printed,authentic,hard-earned bucks? Well..the proposal sounds a bit too over the top even for a cynical environment like Vegas or the U.S.,where people in need for money do much more humiliating things for much less(it's capitalism,baby!): on one hand her virtue as good wife will be compromised for good and she'll have to live with her guilt,on the other hand she will become in an instance one million richer for a job most women would do for free anyway-for the sheer pleasure of the ""act"" especially with someone like Redford,notice that the chemistry between them is mutual,Moore's character not even concealing it,in spite of her much loved husband.For Gage she is nothing but another pastime which comes quite affordable to him as he won and lost three,not one,millions while gambling,untroubled as if it was just spare change. What she doesn't know is that the business will have unwanted consequences for all the three of them,as it will soon turn out to be more than an issue of money. I think that John Gage resembles Gatsby-his elegant garments,his house seems just taken out of the 1974 version of Gatsby,his car,in spite of being a more contemporary model,is also yellow and a Rolls-Royce,just like Gatsby's,even his initials match J.G. being possible to stand for both John Gage and Jay Gatsby.He is even having an affair with a married woman,though Moore's character is not the spoiled Daisy,so doesn't actually have to impress her with luxury(even if he does it,being a true gentleman).Yet another,even more important similarity with Gatsby:he is extremely vulnerable,very lonely under his good-looking,elegant exterior,craving for affection and probably closeting a haunting mystery from his past,trying to make up both for his past and his solitude. Redford is credible in this part,even more credible than as Gatsby-he's either the cocky lover boy(but with moderation,not vulgar,just for en extra touch of thrills),either smart-ass and patronizing like the CEO of some multinational enterprise,handsome and sexy in a very narrow,conventional,American sense of the word,extremely good-looking and athletic yet lacking depth,inner beauty,charisma.Nevertheless I think that back in 1993,in spite of his age,most American women would have accepted Redford's proposal,not the character's if not acted by someone at least as good-looking as him,for free. However as the story twists and he discover that,besides physical attraction she is about to fall in love with him(and he also knows that their love is uncertain and would probably just make her suffer)he finds a very gentleman-like way to separate without hurting her,stating that she did't mean anything to him,that she's just one of the many women which he seduced using the same method,although this is untrue and he really loved her,not only desired her.By letting her go and try to rebuild her life with her less privileged husband,Gage,like Gatsby turns out right in the end.Unlike Gatsby,he doesn't pay with his life for believing in his ideal so much that he overlooks the real face of the loved woman,however he also has to face another sort of death-the death of his dream about the ideal,always longed for,seldomly accessible(yes,in spite of intercourse and humble background she is still inaccessible to him).Due to this romantic,even if somewhat corny outcome,and the sometimes more than conventional character Gage this film might be more than a typical,forgettable Tinseltown blockbuster.",Indecent Proposal
66,mhthehammer,"Great book, lame movie adaptation",4,28 May 2020,"Diane (Demi Moore) and David (Woody Harrelson) are a married couple who spend a night in Las Vegas when they encounter a billionaire John Gage (Robert Redford). Because they are broke and jobless, they make a deal with John that they get $1 million for the mortgage and life savings in exchange for Diane. Indecent Proposal, the book, in which the movie is based on, isn't just a morality tale about marriage and monetary greed. It's a tackle on more complex ideas, such as religious quarrel, biblical temptation, spirituality versus greed, and skill versus luck. However, for the movie, Adrian Lyne and Sherry Lansing dumb down the book's interesting themes in favor of a generic blockbuster with big names, happy ending and other romantic movie tropes that would have been laughed off from The Player. For instance, the movie drops out the Arab and Jewish tensions from the Faustian love triangle, hence abandoning any religious significance. They switch locations from Atlantic City to Las Vegas, probably because it was dirt-cheap and more convenient for Hollywood. Finally, the couple was never high school sweethearts in the novel, whereas in the book the wife, Joan, was already married when the two met and the husband, Josh, was a Holocaust survivor. Although changes have to be made for an adaptation to work as a film, the ones in Indecent Proposal made the project look formulaic and generic. With the remake about to be in progress soon, I just hope that it's more faithful to the book than its predecessor. (2 Kissing Hippos out of 5)",Indecent Proposal

70,correcamino,Fatal Attraction for the Juvie Set,3,24 April 2006,"A good example of the differences between American and foreign cinema can be seen in a film I recently watched on television: Indecent Proposal.Indecent Proposal's two protagonists, David and Diane Murphy are played Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore. I'm not sure if it was their total lack of chemistry or that they were not acting well, but why we should care so much whether these two stay together was beyond me. Love, affection, playfulness, attraction  none of these materialized on screen in their interactions together.Since I knew that eventually Robert Redford would show up, it was clear from the beginning that the good part, the meat of the movie, would be the scenes between him and Demi Moore. Poor Woody Harrelson just could not muster any emotion at all for the film. He seemed to be holding back, preoccupied with his receding hairline.OK, so fast forward. What idiots these two (Diane and David) are for thinking they can win back the $50,000 they owe by gambling. No acting faux pas there, just hideously bad, lazy, unforgivable writing. Of course they lose all their money. Surprised? I know I wasn't. Enter Robert Redford (John Gage in the film)  a romantic, perhaps emotionally frigid man, an updated Gatsby. A very good role and though not a great, great actor, next to those two, Redford looks like Olivier. He immediately falls in love and lust with Diane and we the viewers for once FEEL it. This is how to love a woman! Not David's way, trading gum mouth to mouth with Diane on a slimy pier. (Did I see that right?) As Gage, Redford wears a suit and tie in every scene. Yes it's meant to instruct the seemingly brain dead audience that here is a Rich Man, but he also looks damn good and by this point the brain dead audience appreciates it! Other wardrobe symbolism includes David's now-ironed shirts at the end of the film, signifying resolve, getting it together after a long interlude of forlorn wrinkled shirt wearing.And what is it with California garden parties as depicted in Hollywood movies? Suddenly everyone appears British, complete with lacy dresses, three piece suits for the men, hats (HATS!) and of course the parasol. Yes Diane, her transformation to Rich Man's fiancée now complete, is there at the auction daintily twirling a parasol. Though she insisted that she couldn't be bought, she succumbed at last to the sexual tension. Here is where the film branches off into pure Americana. I mean, of course David and Diane will end up together, my question is: WHY? Diane was bored with David, why not let her ride the Robert Redford wave? And I mean for a good long while? How can she pull herself out of the sexual-romantic thrall of this sexy older man so easily just because Woody Harrelson brings his receding hairline to the garden party, sits himself down and looks Demi Moore in the eyes. That's just not how it goes. He was so WEAK.But we must have our happy ending. We have to swallow the Moral Lesson. We're not sophisticated enough yet to have it otherwise. Director Lyn tried to make a Fatal Attraction for the juvie set, the young'uns.In addition to garden parties in which there's nary an SUV, tee shirt, or baseball cap in sight, such films also feature a reliable public transportation system that connects far-flung California cities and municipalities.

71,alex-306,The single worst movie I have ever seen,1,4 August 1999,"There is a group of five movies, all within one or two degrees of separation from one another, that I consider the five worst movies ever made.  They are: Fatal Attraction, Disclosure, Showgirls, Basic Instinct, and the single greatest cinematic atrocity of all time, Indecent Proposal.  Redford and Woody should be ashamed of themselves for appearing in this vapid, misogynist piece of excrement.  On the other hand, Demi Moore, probably my least favorite actress of all time, is appropriately cast as the female lead.  I don't think even the most gifted living writer would be capable of putting into words just how passionately I hate this movie.  Long, boring, idiotic, and based on a non-issue (should a woman take a million dollars to sleep with Robert Redford?), Indecent Proposal represents everything I hate about Hollywood.  And to top it off, all of the five movies listed above use racy content and an ""R"" rating to lure unsuspecting viewers into watching films that take an essentially puritan, prudish attitude towards sex and sexuality.

74,Eye-on-the-pie-in-the-sky,The Salacious Sundance Kid Wants A Piece Of It,6,15 August 2005,"At once admirable and a gorgeous piece of trash is Adrian Lyne's ""Indecent Proposal"" (1993). Can I get an ""amen"" for affirming that Mr. Lyne is one of the best purveyors of cinematic relationship-angst? Indeed, his ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987) is one of the most horrifying and entertaining movies I've ever seen.David and Diana Murphy (Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore respectivelyobviously) are relatively new to matrimony but are deliriously happy and have big plans for their future. David is an adept architect looking to complete his and his wife's dream house in Santa Monica. Diana is a realtor who pays the bills until the dream is fulfilled. Everything is going great: the blueprints and models have been constructed, the land bought and, of course, the California sun is perpetually shining through the smoggy haze. And then, fate deals them a moral and ethical blow. What leads up to this is an economic recession in which Diana cannot sell a single piece of property and their current assets are in danger of being liquidated. In a spontaneous, desperate measure they both go to Sin City and attempt to raise enough money in order to keep their property and dream alive. They do good for the first night: they brought their original $5000 to $25,000 and celebrate the way all gambling couples do by converting that $25,000 into hard currency, throwing it on a Hilton bed and moistly copulating on and around it. It was quite poetically philosophical in evoking the notion that money has become the apotheosis of sexual lubricant.John Gage (Robert Redford) is a filthy rich womanizer who gets off playing high-stakes blackjack and buying the unbuyable. He encounters the babealicious Diana and immediately realizes that he has something new to distract himself with. Through a complicated series of events he makes the titular offer by exchanging one night with Diana for one million dollars. Quite instinctively, the couple are horrified and indignant. However, later that evening, Diana says that it would only be her body and not her mind or spirit that Gage will have. After debating they agree to the proposal and so forth the conspicuous and financed affair goes.Afterward (did theyyou know, do it?) Diana comes back and they both think that this is something that can be put behind them as long as they never talk about it. Well, David just can't live with that as a little time goes by (could you?) and absolutely insists on finding out what happened that fateful evening. Diana eventually caves and says that there was sex and that it was fantastic. This doesn't mean that she doesn't love David anymore but David takes this a sign that she doesn't love him anymore anyway (men are from Mars, after all). There's a fallout, divorce papers and a bona-fide relationship that begins to develop between Diana and John (he pursues, she relents, the cheetah gets the zebra). Yet after all this we get the super-duper mega happy ending.The ending aside we get some interesting subtleties throughout the film. John Gage is urbane to the Wayne Newton degree and the couple couldn't be less disingenuous and self-righteous than the Republican Party. There is a great deal of flirtation and insinuation that is truly riveting and, at times, quite plausible. However, if this were real life, there's NO WAY the two would be as ultimately conciliatory as they come to be by the end of the film. Call me provincial but, in my eyes, the marriage covenant is inviolable and incapable of repair after such a devastating blow.",Indecent Proposal
75,gigotu,General Hospital is better than this,1,29 April 2006,"Demi Moore proves once again that she cannot act her way out of a pretty paper bag. It was painful to watch her try to be serious in this movie. Woody Harrelson does a bit more credible job of delivering sappy, unintentionally funny lines with a straight face, but there's not much he could have done with lines that seemed like rejects from a daytime soap opera.The saddest thing about this movie, however, is that the once true film star in the group, Robert Redford, was reduced to accepting such a ridiculous role. It must have been strictly a money thing for him because, if he actually saw any artistic merit in playing this role, then he has truly been out in the sun way too long.The most satisfying aspect of watching this movie was the fact that I didn't waste a dime to see it - just a little time.",Indecent Proposal
76,shmucking,Uneven but makes good points about jealousy and trust,7,7 March 2010,"The film is at it's best in the scenes where Woody Harrelson is feeling jealous about Demi Moore's lovemaking with Robert Redford. When he's struggling with his obsessions about it, there is a certain validity that rings true, and he has a great scene near the end where he tells Moore that he was insecure about himself, but isn't anymore. The romance between Harrelson and Moore has a genuine quality that is sweet and sincere.There are problems, however, with Redford's character and Redford himself. Moore is so obviously not attracted to Redford that their romantic scenes together look uncomfortable. Her character is supposed to be attracted to him, but it isn't convincing. You can tell she's turned off by him, and when she kisses him, she looks like she's kissing her dad. Redford plays the role with his usual mellow likability and smoothness, but it doesn't match the character he's playing. It doesn't seem believable that he'd offer money to sleep with someone's wife. He seems too easy-going and amiable to make such an offer. It seems like Redford is having fun playing the role, and being a good sport about it, but not really connecting with the darker side of the character. Overall, an interesting film with some valid comments about overcoming jealousy and having trust in the love you share with your partner, but it falls short of being truly successful.",Indecent Proposal

78,max_tony,One of the most entertaining morality plays,6,1 October 2008,"INDECENT PROPOSAL, along with THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE (Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves) are two of the most entertaining morality plays out there. The moral to the story, without needing to go into Christian theology or anything else is really simple: there's no such thing as a free lunch. I remember when the movie was out in the theatres and the many sound bite talk show people would ask guests and people on the street if they would do what the couple Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson did in the film; so many fools said ""yes, in a heartbeat"" and I wondered about the education system of our country! The line of the stylish Robert Redford when Demi Moore accused him (while slowly being seduced by him) of being a man ""who likes to own things"" summed up the whole movie: ""You think I need to BUY women?"" Redford, a man in this movie who as a billionaire has seen and caused the birth and death of multi-national corporations the size of ancient civilizations, knew EXACTLY what would happen to their marriage, and to their mind- and to her heart, if they knowingly accepted this proposal most indecent. He depended on THEIR arrogance and scoffing at the fragile nature of human relationships and the invisible architecture of the human soul; knowing, like every man (and woman) with a secret plan for another human being, that that would bring about the predictable but unexpected chain of outer events. The movie's most poignant turn, however, is when he reveals the road not taken in HIS life, with all his billions, and how that has generated much of his actions. Only then do we really discover under no uncertain terms what he wants, and what he is willing to do to get it. That really begins the falling domino of epiphanies that leads to the revealing of the gentle, fragile and beautiful hearts of all three of the characters, and the transcendent power of love, commitment and surrender. It's a good guy/girl movie as well, because Woody Harrelson is so much the All-American man, full of rambunctious flaws and money problems (can't relate), where Robert Redford is, well, Robert Redford; he is the next best thing to Sean Connery's James Bond in this movie when it comes to the debonair, power- broker man the women couldn't resist if he had a 30k a year job, let alone making 30k every couple of hours. The testosterone is there. Combine that with the transformation of both of their characters because of the love of Demi Moore, who can play the dichotomous strong/weak women better than most of the Hollywood actresses out there still (if she would just take better scripts- aren't the bills paid sweetie?), and you've got more intelligent INNER action, romance and sympathy than you can shake a stick at. Worth owning. Ignore some of it's flaws (too miniscule to mention really; if you want CASABLANCA than buy that for Gawd sakes) and you'll have a great time with it- perhaps even learn something about yourself that you didn't know you knew.",Indecent Proposal

Such as, ""Can anything be bought?,"" ""What is the impact of adultery on a relationship"" and forgetting versus forgiving. I found the film entirely believable, and people's reactions very true to life. Demi More's acting as ""D"" was outstanding, and Woody as David good (especially lecturing on architecture)! Robert as John Gage was rather intermittent. The labrador (dog) was good! Lawyer too!If you are interested in relationships, and thinking about serious questions, as well as good filming you should enjoy this.POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE: Downsides? Yes, what the others say about some of the inconsistencies and whether John Gage's sudden turnaround is credible are true - but I only found this a small detraction from an excellent and thought provoking film, which pictured the emptiness of living for money, and the strength of love.",Indecent Proposal
86,tmensamaster-2,An example of how some cliches still have life,7,15 October 2002,"Before I viewed this film, I have always considered Adrian Lyne to be a sleazeball. He always has to make these, as he calls them, ''relationship dramas'': I've always just thought he made porn. I howled through '9 1/2 Weeks' , especially in the ''slide-show scene'', I think 'Fatal Attraction' has a ''kick-in-the-teeth'' ending and 'Flashdance' was pure crap. His 'Jacobs Ladder' had promise but also didn't have a satisfactory ending. I didn't think I'd ever see a good film of his till I watched 'Indecent Proposal'.My God is the film a cliche!!! But what an effective one. The film is about a destitute couple[Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson] who accept a wager from a zillionaire[Played by Robert Redford]  that Moore will spend one night with Redford for one million dollars. 'Another sleazeball plot from Lyne' I thought but decided to watch it for laughs. But I was surprised.I was touched by this film. I know its just a cliche from beginning to end but it has life in it. Redford was the perfect pick for the millionaire[I've always considered him to be a bit shifty] and Moore and Harrelson give the best performances possible given the material. The plot is fairly 'daytime soap' stuff and it follows that kind of formula. But Lyne somehow infuses it with life and makes us care. I have to say I was touched by the ending and liked the way it was done[POSSIBLE SPOILER...Moore walking through the fog on a pier, reminding me vividly of 'Requiem for a Dream']. Even their stupid whining and moaning is compelling, in a bizarre way. I did have problems with Moore's relationship with Redford though[does she love him too?] but I didn't seem to care about it sins against logic. At the end, all I could think was ''I actually like an Adrian Lyne film !'. Give its cliches a chance and you may like it too............3 out of 4",Indecent Proposal
87,Dewhistle,"Revolting concept, more revolting reactions",5,23 January 2006,"It wasn't that this was a poorly made movie, or that the acting was bad. It could have certainly made a good point but all it seems to have done is stir the entire film-watching community into an unfathomable dilemma. To wonder whether you would do such a thing in such circumstances and not be sure you would not is appalling.The idea of the husband agreeing to it is sickening and hard to grasp, but his later inability to cope with the thought of it brings it back down to earth. If a man managed to persuade himself of the insignificance of his wife's having sex just once with another man, he's a fool and either doesn't care or must realize later he was wrong. This guy felt it come home to him as he surely must.And she was made to appear a sweet little self-sacrificing angel, which brings mixed feelings. He agreed to it initially and in theory had no business treating her like a criminal. And yet, she went and carried it out, with no apparent suffering. Anyone with any real integrity, honesty, and well... morals, would surely have some trouble with this, unless they indeed found it alluring enough to overcome their scruples.That rich dude was also well-acted, but how creepy! Sexy he wasn't. He was a stalker, creeping around her everywhere she went and smugly buying her life piece by piece as if it were all part of buying her. I agree with those who said that the idea of his giving her up in the end was a crock. That kind of narcissist doesn't let go once he has what he wants. But I also think he did need to be attractive (on the surface anyhow) because that was pivotal to the jealously of the idiot husband and the uncertainty of the tart wife.This is on my list of movies that never should have been made. It was one long ""eew"" moment for me and never once raised the question of whether I would. Believe it or not, there are some folks in the world who can see that it could never be worth it. Money can't buy back a filthy act. It's sad to see the morals of so many degraded to the point that they could even consider it.The rating of 5 stars is for the acting and the film quality.",Indecent Proposal
88,norakecer,Interesting film,8,31 May 2010,"Indecent proposal is an interesting film maybe no the best but still a very good film. First of all, unlike mentioned in some reviews I don't think Robert Redford was miscast because according to some reviewers that he was too handsome for the role so any woman would sleep with him anyway even for free. The interesting thing for me : Yes Robert Redford is devastatingly handsome even aged in his fifties in this film but Diana and David are very much in love but totally broke and they need the money desperately.Why it is interesting ? because I think that Robert Redford as John Gage should be able to have all the women he wants without paying anything - The main point is that John GAGE wants Diana and no one else : something clicked inside him when he first saw her in the shop.It was not only a sexual attraction but also a strong feeling for her. The fact that he is handsome is interesting because you feel at the beginning of the film that David could be jealous of John Gage not only because of his money but also because of Gage's looks and great presence. David is aware of that and I believe is worried that Diana could be attracted to him as well from a romantic point of view. And he's right because Diana is attracted to John GAGE maybe not consciously at the beginning but she is later in the film when she realizes that he is a real gentle man looking for love. Actually she would like to hate him but she can't. That's why it is hard for Diana to talk about her fateful night with . John Gage when David asked her. If John Gage was portrayed as a bad-looking,rough guy, it might have been much easier for Diana to do it for money no risk then to feel attracted to the guy or to fall in love with him because it would be just sex and - that's all -no feelings involved. No risks at all so no interests, no suspense in the film.The film wouldn't be as interesting as it is. As for John GAGE,we know that he wanted to prove to David and Diana that everything could be bought, even people but he also realizes that feelings cannot be bought as he wanted Diana to love him like she loves David. It's an interesting film from different point of views.",Indecent Proposal
89,masked film critic,"Appalling, exploitative trash",1,6 March 2000,"All those who believe Edward Wood to be the worst film director of all time really ought to consider the career of Adrian Lyne after seeing this.  As a psychological drama, it is dreadfully limp - I felt I knew nothing about the characters after seeing it.  The high concept is all - it could have been an interesting idea, but in Lyne's hands, any moral issues are ultimately brushed aside in a brutally unconvincing attempt at a weepie.  Visually, it's all television commercial stuff - empty gloss signifying nothing.  At the end, I felt cheated, manipulated and dirty for sitting through this cheap and nasty rubbish.",Indecent Proposal

91,nautilus_gr,Money vs love,7,11 May 2002,"Even though the main story is about something that is not very likely to happen, this film has a strange way to approach real life and bring it so realistic to the screen. What we see in the film is the everyday life of a couple that has to work in order to live. And they do, and they are happy, until the day they experience an 'earthquake' in their relationship. The earthquake is Robert Redford's indecent proposal.Apart from bringing in an incredibly realistic way the dilemma they have in front of them, the film also shows many ways in which a person can express love to another person; it can be done by fighting, by talking, by understanding, by appreciating, by thinking. But, what about money; and, especially when we are talking about people who live without lots of it.When you see this film and the story ends, you will find yourself thinking. I cannot predict what you'll be thinking, but I am sure that after you see the end of the film, you'll think about it for some time.",Indecent Proposal

Whenever I want to remember romantic movies, this movie comes to my mind after 'Casablanca'.Anybody searching romantic and emotional movies should never miss 'Indecent Proposal'. The dialogues are written very beautifully, as this story is from a novel. The most positive side of this movie is that it creates romantic emotions to viewer's minds. The world is going towards artificial things and we are forgetting true love. This movie beautifully shows that true love is not purchasable and it should not be sacrificed for anything else.Personally, I do not watch twice a movie because it seems to me that second time watching of a movie might lessen my first feeling of watching.

95,1of1,Shameful waste of talent,1,16 June 1999,"Obviously, a number of agents didn't see beyond dollar signs when they signed up their clients for this 117-minute *omage* to the courtesan complex.Sure, the film could have been alright, had the $1 million been left out of it.   Seriously.  The amount of the check doesn't matter,prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of ""love conquers all"" can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant to imply ""for richer for poorer, for pimping as in fidelity"".  Picture the story otherwise, though:  2 kids, flat broke, borderline ""desperate"" and completely stupid.  They collide with wealthy business man.  Kids' marriage is strained by imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something of a loser.  Enter Mr. Tuxedo, oozing charm and stability -- a virtual magnet for the ticking biological clock -- and with him the wife's temptation, tensions, suspense.  Whom will she choose? Maybe, under those conditions, I could actually care.  As-is, frankly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy winds up the sympathetic character. A woman who will sell herself is just about what a guy deserves who will pimp out his wife.  The indecent proposition makes the husband a TOTAL loser, deficient in every positive male characteristic, and makes the wife a cheap strumpet seduced by money rather than confused by another potential love, a woman devoid of moral center and self-respect.All the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted on this film -- and it was an impressive amount -- couldn't save it from its splashy-but-too-trashy $1 million pitch line.

And don't think you can just have sex without feeling something. Sex is about feeling love. No wonder it is called ""making love"". Love feeds passion and passion feeds love.  There is a truth in that, and if you don't feel it, you may be missing something. If your relationship is strong enough it will overcome problems like almost losing your house. It will also overcome a mistake like this. But never think you can ignore what has happened and just not talk about it.

Believe me, I never saw the three main characters before or may be I did not remember any one of them. To me, the personality of Robert Redford was quite appealing. In future, if I know of some movie that has Redford in it, it will undoubtedly become a must-see movie for me. I must have talked about the movie with a number of chat friends in USA and found a majority of them had not seen the movie. But the ones who had seen, had words of praise for it.

Perhaps if you're a billionaire looking like Redford,8,14 April 2008,"I've read a comment about how this movie is so unrealistic and everything, but I think the situation is entirely probable. Perhaps not in the exact events, but the idea of someone richer offering something a current partner cannot offer; when love is tested by the lure of greater comfort in luxury.What I love about this movie, is that it explores the naiveness of the love between Diane and David, but also the strength of true love. On top of that, the moral relationship between love and money, and how the doubts and demons we have inside, can push a perfectly established relationship away.Yes Diane may have ended up with Mr Billionaire for a while, looking quite happy, but the happiness that Diane and David and shared, which can be seen in the movie, it cannot be recreated with someone else, though who is to say that you cannot be happy with someone else, given life's comforts and a relatively good looking man to boot. (John was also suavely persistent.) John commented at the near end of the movie, ""she never would have looked at me the way she looked at him."". This shows that you can buy happiness but not love.Though through it all, Diane returns to David, with nothing, no more millions but their love is so much more enriched. This is the general idea of how marriage/relationships in real life is like, that is not all smooth and a bed of roses. There are always thorns and to get past them, is summarized in what David said to Diane before signing their divorce papers, ""when people stay together, it's not that they forget, is that they forgive."" If you're lovers, this movie definitely shows you that as much as you love one another, you must never jeopardize the longevity of your relationship, thinking your love is invincible.If you're working your way to be like John, the billionaire, you better snag a single woman fast before you end up lonely and single end of the day.",Indecent Proposal

103,RobertEspositoTVGuide,Don't Sell this one short until you Understand the reasoning.....,9,27 January 2006,"Keeping personal views out of comments are what objectively reviewing a film is all about. I have to say this film is one that can pull at heart strings if you can immerse yourself in the emotion of what is actually happening. The film's premise is Love versus Money. The plot of the film is set to slowly pull you into the characters' who are presented with the temptation of the choice. Woody Harrelson really pulls off a serious character in this one. Having taken the deal from John Gage (Robert Redford) to give away his wife for one night in return for a Million dollars, Harrelson realizes too late that the choice he has made would damage the relationship beyond repair. Let me say this, watching Harrelson run to the closed door once he realizes what he has done is a powerful scene if you can put yourself in the situation. As the movie progresses it does a wonderful job of making the viewer have a hard time hating Redford's character. At times the viewer is convinced that Moore's character belongs with Redford. The movie then switches to Harrelson's character that is devastated and living on his own coping with the loss. As Moore's Character is seduced by Redford, Harrelson slips slowly into depression. Once again, the movie gives the viewer a chance to experience many different emotions. John Barry's Concerto playing throughout this movie really adds to the somber mood. A wonderful placement of this music as the characters slowly move towards the movie's end. Some good acting by all here is evident. Do not sell this movie short because on the outside it seems to be choppy. It was meant to put the viewer in all situations the characters are in. I recommend this one to anyone who is a hopeless romantic.Best Scene: There are manyOne that comes to mind is Harrelson's character reflecting on the relationship with Moore as he sits alone in his empty apartment with his dog by his side.",Indecent Proposal

105,burggr,A movie that shows human error and how they recover.,7,10 June 2017,"I believe that the theme of Indecent Proposal is that it is not worth
even one million dollars to have an affair on your spouse as everyone
involved suffers major emotional, financial, and spiritual consequences
as they did in this film. The plot involves three main characters.
Woody Harrelson plays David Murphy, Demi Moore plays Diana Murphy, and
Robert Redford plays John Gage.David and Diana are a young married couple who are very much in love.
They both have promising careers as David is a talented architect and
Diana is are a real estate broker. However, they run into some
financial hardships and decide to try to win money in Las Vegas. They
end up meeting John Gage who happens to be a billionaire. He offers a
large sum of money to be with Diana for one night. Without giving away the ending, I'll just say that it becomes
complicated as there are emotional and relational consequences for
David, Diana, and David's decisions. The story unfolds in a somewhat
unpredictable manner and takes us through the struggles of money
troubles and relationship conflicts with all three characters. The film
points out in an indirect manner the mistakes that all three characters
make. There is betrayal in an emotional sense and the movie makes us
ask ourselves what I can do in my relationships so I don't have any
regrets.Other plot points include the moral dilemma they both encounter. David
and Diana are in a loving, faithful marriage but are faced with a
proposal that is difficult to refuse. They both understand that they
could really use $1 million right now. At first they both say that they
don't want to do it but Diana says that she would do it for him and
their future. She says to David that it would be just sex and that they
would have they money for a lifetime. It is an especially tough
decision as their mortgage payments are behind and they find themselves
financially desperate. In the movie Basic Instinct which stars Michael Douglas as detective
Nick Curran and Sharon Stone who plays Catherine Tramell, there is a
similar theme as Indecent Proposal. This is because while Curran is
investigating a murder, he becomes involved in a passionate and
emotional relationship with Catherine who happens to be the prime
suspect. This passionate affair is similar to the one that John and
Diana had in Indecent Proposal.The lighting in the film Indecent Proposal was dimly light and
sometimes even seemed as though there was smoke in the room. This can
equate to the confusion or mysterious man behind the proposal who
happened to be John Gage the billionaire. It can also symbolize the
indecisiveness of this major decision that David and Diana needed to
make and also illustrate the mess that resulted in their decision. The camera angles in Indecent Proposal made John Gage's character seem
to be larger than life. They did this by not having a lot of empty
space when they shoot him and used close-ups to make him seem powerful
which he was. He had this position of power because he had a great deal
of money and also power over David and Diana. The angles that they used
to shoot David were just the opposite. It seemed as though they wanted
to diminish David's character because there were not as many close- ups
nor were there many shoots to make him look important or powerful. This
is because of the position he was in with Gage having power over him
and Diana. This was a movie that is for adults as there are sex scenes and foul
language used. The film shows us how a decision about accepting money
can change the nature of a healthy relationship. It also shows that
money is not more important than remaining faithful to your spouse.
This movie points out how the idea of how having money can be
detrimental in many ways. This includes finances, relationships, trust
and betrayal.",Indecent Proposal

How would anybody else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife was even CONSIDERING it would be a good idea to sleep with the other guy even for a million bucks. After all, she was the one talking about it in bed and saying how it would be good for them since he can build his house or whatever with that money. Woody never fully agreed to it until she talked him into it. How CAN you trust her? Who the hell would actually even consider that if they were married? I don't care how desperate they were. That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in my life. Then, he flips out on her. Apparently, he had no right to mistrust her, other than the fact that his wife just slept with another dude who is extremely rich and handsome. Oh and wait, then he's supposed to apologize to HER after she files for the divorce so she can be with the guy she slept with. Of course Woody has no right to say anything to her or mistrust her especially after she still has Roy Hobb's card in her wallet. Then, at the end of the movie, she's apparently so in love with Woody still and misses him so much, that she was not going to leave Hobbs until he made some ridiculously stupid story up to try to hint to her to leave, and she bleeping thanks Hobbs???? Are you bleeping kidding me? Was she under contract as his sex slave or something?? I mean what the bleep?? Oh and wait it gets better. She bleeping kisses him passionately before she gets out of the car. Yea, she's not a whore. Oh, thank you for letting me go, let me go make out with you one last time for good ole' sake.

113,joojoo3211,"It wasn't a great movie, but it entertained.",4,31 March 2007,"Only saw this movie late last night. I remember the hype of it's release and to be honest had I viewed it back then I maybe wouldn't have been so generous. I hate hype, it can ruin a movie. I think the movie glossed over the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too - although kept wondering if he was stoned the whole time. It never went too deep. Redford was dark but not too dark and his character let me down in the end. To me he should have been more confrontational with Demi - throwing her out perhaps or telling her that she was paid for. After all he would have investigated them before he made the proposal - that's not shown in the movie, but no one in his perceived position would have made an offer to just anyone. He was cruel to the point of breaking them up and the last straw was the house and yet Demi fell for him? The passages giving an insight to Demi and Woody's relationship were the best part of the movie. There was a keen deepness that outshone the shallowness of John Gages character. He really could have been a lot stronger and as other people have alluded I think the movies draw-card was Redford and they didn't want tarnish his ""image"". I say what the hell Robert was old in this movie! Woody and Demi's characters were naive in a sense, but I think that was very intentional to draw you to their plight and champion their decision. But the reality is, they were losing their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? to gamble what little they had left and then accept a proposal from an insanely rich billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford was seducing them a little too unrealistic. The movie could have been so much more and other actors would have made a difference, but having said that on late night TV - it was enjoyable and I if you don't think too much - also palatable",Indecent Proposal

Millionaires are assholes and this movie pictures the millionaire as a man with a heart .. Millionaires are animals .. they do not have hearts . they think they can buy everything with their money, even happiness and love and this is exactly where this movie tries in a disgusting way to prove them right .. Even her return to her man at the end comes after the millionaire's blessing :-) .. i mean nth in the entire movie happened against the millionaire's wish .. he got what he wanted whenever he wanted and even left away whenever he chooses, even love and happiness .. which is untrue and doesn't reflect any reality ..

115,devashin,Really good movie,8,8 September 2008,"Have I watched a different movie? I am really shocked to see such a good movie get only 5.3 stars. Plot? Good Acting? Good Direction? GoodThe conflict in the minds of both the D's is shown very well.The night they cant sleep, they talk about it, they try to justify it because they know that it will take all their troubles away. It was very important that their financial crises was shown properly otherwise neither would have considered the deal. And it was. Maybe the lines ""Did I ever tell you I love you......"" are a little cheesy, but every couple has some...and they had theirs. The criticism I have read is rather empty. You can't rate a movie bad just because it's depressing. Did The Godfather get you all pumped up to join the mafia or what? Some people are cursing the billionaire. It couldn't be clearer that he DID care for her. He cared for her enough to barge into her class, to get her to show him some properties,cared for her enough to let her go (maybe the reason was also partially selfish, still) all he wanted was a chance. Being a billionaire and someone who is used to getting what he wants, he made the ""Indecent Proposal"" and pursued her till she gave into him. People are saying that there's no message in the movie. The simplest message was that when you marry someone, you promise to take care of them. D failed to do that and left a big scar on his marriage. But because their love was true, she came back to him.""If you let go off of something and it never comes back to you, then it was never truly yours to begin with ""...(or something like that)...",Indecent Proposal

Demi Moore's performance is just brilliant! The way she and Woody bounce off each other truly makes you believe their relationship is solid. A different approach to any other love story I've seen, exploring issues of trust, power and money in new ways that make you look at things with a new perspective.Overall, a very lovely film with a perfect ending, turning an old movie into a new favourite!How do you think you'd react to this situation?This film is definitely worth a watch... Grab a bucket of ice-cream and a glass of wine and don't expect a blockbuster... this story is a gentle ride for those can that find romance in the most unlikely places - like a pair of pants burning on a stove!",Indecent Proposal
118,kaylznmartin,Romantic film for the girls,9,4 July 2011,"I watched this film recently having heard people talk about it for years. I warmed to both Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore's characters immediately and thought there love for each other came across as beautiful on screen.I think the casting for Robert Redford's character was perfect, unlike many other people. If the John Gage character was played by a unattractive, mean guy then David Murphy (woody) would have no need to feel jealous about the night his wife spent with the billionaire. The reason David felt jealous as he explains at the end is because he can see how successful, good looking and charming John Gage is and he was worried his wife would fall in love with him. He was also riddled with his own insecurities and failings and believed his wife deserved a man like Gage.Although he came across as a bit of a sleaze ball in the beginning, watching Diana Murphy (demi) across the casino gambling with her husband in the end it showed he was a lonely man looking for companionship. He lives in a world where everything can be bought and he was proved right when Diana and David agreed to his proposal.However when David visited Diana at the end to sign the divorce papers, although John Gage did not feel sorry for David he simply knew Diana would never love him the way she loved David and so knew he could not buy her love.Overall a very romantic film about a young couple, so deeply in love that they believe they can cope with the 1million proposal when in reality jealousy is a strong emotion which in the end tears them apart. However in true Hollywood fashion, love conquers all and the couple reunite at the end.A lesson learned also that money does not buy happiness and although the couple were in serious debt, they had each other and not the complications of a third man.Loved the film and shed a tear at the end on the pier :)",Indecent Proposal

120,nadereti,Indecent Proposal a great film to watch,7,31 July 2013,"Indecent Proposal was released in 1993, It was about two young married couples David and Diana Murphy, they thought they invisible based on the loved they have shared over the years, David almost lost his wife (Diana) to a billionaire in the quest of having his dream house. There was recession in the country at that time and they were about losing their properties, they decided to go gamble so maybe they will make some to carry on with life but unfortunately they lost all their money. Diana ran into a multi billionaire John Gage whom at the spot was attracted to her which made him offer David one million dollars to spend a night with his wife (Diana). David and Diana thought about the offer and made a mutual decision to give it a shot. After the night, David started feeling insecure based on Diana's relationship with Gage which resulted to a separation between them. Feelings started developing between Diana and Gage after separation with David after a slight resistance from her towards Gage. David became down and out and he decided to sign the standing order documents sent to him by Diana and as well gave out the one million dollars just to let Diana and Gage realize he does care about the money. Gage decided to let go of Diana so that she could make amends with her husband (David), Gage gave her his lucky coin. Diana went to pier at paradise cove where David proposed to her, she met David there and they started all over again. Indecent Proposal revealed struggle of love, fidelity, and morality between David and Diana when money is offered, I realized in the film that worse decisions are made when people are in problems and at the end of the day, they regret ever taking the drastic decisions. The convincing emotional crisis the movie showed at the end of the film will make couples out there know that true love wins The lighting in the movie was not too soft which I think is perfect for the story line; overall, it made the film colorful. The camera in the film was close to the objects, and the camera angle suits the film as well.",Indecent Proposal
121,reelzworld,Money Cant Buy You Love,10,1 October 2013,"Indecent proposal is the type of film that makes you look within when it comes to your current or past relationship. I think this film is one of the best for roles I have seen both Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson featured in. There is nothing like a good romantic film that makes you think long after the movie is finished. The plot of this film is one that we all can relate to. Two high school sweethearts who face struggles go to Vegas to bet in all in hopes of financial freedom. Although they lost it all they are approached by a billionaire who offers one night with David's (Woody) wife (Demi) in exchange for one million dollars. This film uses many themes throughout such as human relationships. Any person willing to offer money for sex with another mans wife clearly is suffering from human relationship problems. Morals are also put to the test not only for David and Diana relationship. But also for John (Robert Redford) who plays the role of the billionaire. All three major actors and actress are placed in hard decision, which test their morals. While lying in the bed David and Diana discuss rather or not take up John on his offer. At that point you notice how the lighting changes dim and dark. As if this begins the start of darkness for the high school sweethearts. In 2009 there was film released by the name of The Box this two film are filmier because of the choices that have to be made based off of love and the finically status of a relationship. If you have seen Indecent Proposal then you will absolutely love The Box. I would like to end by saying although Diana and David marriage was put to the test one theme that tells the truth about this couple is coming of age. No matter what good or bad times two people who truly love each other can overcome all things. And always remember money cannot buy you or anyone love.",Indecent Proposal
122,Lehmen02,Indecent Thoughts,7,14 December 2013,"Since the beginning of civilizations or even before, people were putting monetary value on everything they could. After a while, people began to realize a concept that everything was for sale for a certain amount depending on the individual. In a nut shell, what is your price for something you cherish deeply? In the early nineties, the blockbuster film Indecent Proposal challenged the aged-old question. David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana Murphy (Demi Moore) was a happy and regular middle class couple. The only problem they had was a relatively big one. The recession had left them both financially strapped. They were facing foreclosure on their current home and the home of their dreams they were building (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). In an effort to pay off their debts, they decide to go to Las Vegas to get quick money (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). In the casino, they meet John Gage (Robert Redford) a billionaire, playboy. After a short game of pool, he makes an offer of 1 million dollars to spend a night with Diana (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). The money was more than enough to pay off their debts and live well, but they would have to sell a piece of their soul for it. Thus a deal with the devil. In the film, there are various themes throughout. For one, the love and happiness of David & Diana Murphy is universal, and it can be understood by pretty much everyone (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In addition, the heartbreak of the Murphy couple is universal as well. Likewise, the theme of human dignity is a major element in this film, because the characters are challenged figuratively to stand erect and morally, too (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). As the characters Diana, David and John try to move forward after the one-night deal, it is clear that conflict between two forces are going be an obstacle, and only one of the guys is going to walk away as the winner. Eventually the situation comes to a confrontation at a charity event (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). Desperate to win back Diana, David out bids John Gage's 50 thousand dollar offer on a Rhino by bidding a cool 1 million (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). In this scene, the character David Murphy was challenged to stand up and be a man, and he definitely did. In front of Diana and John, David gives the money back from the one-night deal to charity in an effort to win back her heart, because the money never meant anything like she did to him (Lansing & Lyne, 1993). The cinematographer captured David looking proud and bold by shooting an upward looking angle at him. The result was David finally looked like he stood up to his fierce competitor John Gage. Throughout the film, the dilemma of money and love was a repeating pattern, and it was really a motif to the film (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). Likewise, the movie Money Can't Buy Me Love and Indecent Proposal have really similar themes. In both, the characters are blinded by money, and at the same time, they are in search of love. Ironically, the love is in front of their faces the whole time. After viewing the film, it is still clear that everything has a price, but that price is more than a monetary number. For instance, the character David Murphy realized that having 1 million dollars without Diana was not worth it. Thus, he was happier before the decision. However, one would never know for sure. In all, love and money are universal concepts that people have been try to balance. Likewise, if you do not have love in your life, money is worth nearly as much.",Indecent Proposal
123,svein_tore,More than one movie,10,7 April 2021,"Daring title that draws to it. It makes you think, without seeing it. Was expecting a movie about the doubts of doing it for the money and then the fallout/aftermath from that. It delivers well on the first part. Diana first see it as a no deal to do it then faces doubt later on. Was expecting much more on the aftermath. The makers of the movie wanted a happy ending, seems like they struggled to get there with just the aftermath story. So incomes Robert Redford when you have such a famous actor on board why not use him to full extend. Dating a billionaire you do not love. This makes the story a lot more complicated than the initial money for one night. Adding to that the story about why billionaire Gage did this, the girl he did not pursue because of low confidence. This is enough material for two movies.Several of the smaller characters is good too. Oliver Platt as the friend/lawyer. Gage's assistant Shackleford could have been a spooky guy in a thriller but comes of as satisfied with a new chance on life.Still with the happy ending and the nice music, enjoyed the movie.",Indecent Proposal

The get-rich-quick approach is also endemic of modern Americans. That part of the script was believable. However, to be realistic - when they went to LV to win money (yup, everybody wins a ton of money in Vegas) - they should have lost it all and wound up prostituting themselves for food money. Having Robert Redford offering a million dollars - OY! - I laughed out loud when that hit the screen.",Indecent Proposal
125,ohhnoo,A film suitable - only - for those capable of true love,9,16 March 2015,"You don't have to be in a relationship to watch this film, you don't even have to have been in love to watch it! This is a film about what love is capable of doing to you.But to truly watch and enjoy this film, you must be a believer of 'True Love', the fairy tale kinda love. If however, your of the 'love em and leave em' kind, or if your a 'I've had many relationships that last months/years, and when it ends, it doesn't really bother me' kinda person, then you might wanna watch something else.The film isn't really about the money either, which could be a million or a billion, or maybe only a few hundred. How desperate you are is relative. What matters is your reason for accepting/refusing. How much do you love yourself, would you 'allow' them and still want to be with them? How much do you love your partner & could you forgive them? If you agree, can things ever return to the 'fairy tale' you had before? If you want/allow them to accept, can you risk losing them to the person paying money? After all, if you believe in fairy tale love, a night with a handsome stranger should be enough to ignite the flame of both passion and love in both parties, whilst your on the side-lines?This film isn't about a one night stand! Its about your emotional attachment to your partner, and your future wants and desires, and what life might bring in the future for you both.This film is a true 1990's masterpiece. The music of Sade sets the tone perfectly! It will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions, and leave you asking yourself, and your partner; ""would I, would you, would we""? I don't understand the score this film has (5, really!) but I suspect its too many people focusing on the money, not being able to fully comprehend the feelings/love, but I give it a 9!

I thought that the chemistry between Woody and Demi was extraordinary. The one complaint that I have for this movie was the way that John Gage (Robert Redford) would try and make it a point that money is everything. Robert did however, do a great job at portraying a millionaire. I do wish that would have went into more detail about the night that David and Diana earned their big paycheck.
