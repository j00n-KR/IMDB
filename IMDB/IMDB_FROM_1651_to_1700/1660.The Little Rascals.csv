0,Leofwine_draca,I wish they hadn't bothered,2,8 February 2018,"An attempt to replicate the success of the 1920s - 1940s film series for modern audiences, THE LITTLE RASCALS is a lamentable enterprise which has completely the wrong look and tone. I admit freely that I didn't laugh a single time. This is merely a badly-acted, over the top production that utilises stupid special effects and child actors with little to no discernable talent. All of the warmth and charisma of the original stars is missing in these cheap imitators. The plot is merely a string of gags ripped off from the original short films, none of which are funny. I suppose most people will only be interested in it today for the Donald Trump cameo. It's a good example of everything that was wrong with 1990s-era Hollywood comedy.",The Little Rascals
1,mark.waltz,Some moments of cuteness can't hide the cringiness.,3,20 November 2019,"When the minor characters of Porky and Buckwheat steal the few moments that they're on screen and leave the leading gang members of Spanky and Alfalfa to rip off what was done better 60 years before in ways that will make fans of the original series of shorts cringe. The great thing about the original series is that even when the kids were trying to act like adults, they didn't be anything but kids playacting and being silly. Here, their adult dialog is completely out of place, a fault of the script and not the majority of the cast. But each time that Froggy, Darla and Waldo are on hand, I cringed. Waldo's narcissism makes him instantly dislikable, an irony considering who plays his father in a completely unnecessary and hypocritical cameo.There is no central plotline other than their desire to create a new go cart after theirs is stolen, with the town bullies chasing Alfalfa and Spanky into a ballet hall where they try to act like Mae West to fool them. It's artificial and tacky. In addition, cameos (some with no dialog) have no real point. Even when the feeling of nostalgia takes over when you hear the iconic theme and see a Petey lookalike, it quickly fades. The dialog is often very inappropriate for children the age of these characters, and that makes this one of the most unnecessary rip-off movies ever made.",The Little Rascals
2,anaconda-40658,Inferior to the TV Show.,4,25 August 2015,"The Little Rascals (1994): Dir: Penelope Spheeris / Cast: Bug Hall, Travis Tedford, Brittany Ashton Holmes, Kevin Jamal Woods, Zachary Mabry: Misguided family film about trouble and innocence. It regards a group of children who hang out at a club house with a strict rule against girls. This becomes a problem when one of the members is caught courting a little girl. This is the film's first problem. There might be nostalgia for fans of the classic TV show but for a family film this presents themes that may be above the age group this is aimed at. The relationship between one of the Rascals and the girl comes off somewhat disturbing in terms of dialogue that skirts adult. After the club house burns down they attempt to raise money and the method is a kids race for a cash prize. This might have been the proper angle to present this material. Director Penelope Spheeris is coming off great success with Wayne's World but here she is backed by a production that resembles the classic program but without a screenplay worthy of it. It doesn't even seem nostalgic for those whom may celebrate the popular TV program. The young cast play out their roles with certain appeal but the adult communication is a distraction. Another issue is the lack of parents. There is numerous celebrity cameos supporting the show's popularity but the end result is a bigger mess than anything the rascals conjure up. Score: 4 / 10",The Little Rascals
3,Smells_Like_Cheese,It's cute,5,14 May 2004,"This movie is a legend in my neighborhood. Because one of the kids from my old school in my grade was one of the bullies. So, my classroom had to watch this. We were all wondering what he had been up too. This is the most exciting thing ever to happened in my neighborhood. Sad, isn't it? The movie ""The Little Rascals"" is adorable. But it lacks somewhere. The kids are all brats. I don't think I was even able to really enjoy the cameos. But this is more of a kid's film. Not a movie you'd watch as a grown up. But congats to Zac, he made it... somewhat. And the movie is enjoyable if you are 7. Otherwise, you'd might want to skip it.5/10",The Little Rascals
4,cricketbat,Takes me back to my younger years,8,19 June 2019,"Maybe it's just the nostalgia talking, but The Little Rascals is better than I remembered. It's a fun family film full of memorable quotes and moments. It captures the feel of the original series while being able to stand on its own, as well. It's not a perfect movie, but it's an entertaining movie, and that's all it really needs to be.",The Little Rascals
5,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,6,20 July 2012,"The Little Rascals Kids today are exactly the same as kids 50 years ago. Except the mischief that modern scamps get up today involves bullying others to kill themselves.And while the tykes in this comedy aren't setting up hate websites, they do enjoy tomfoolery.The esteemed members of The He-Man Women Haters Club are dumbfounded when one of their own, Alfalfa (Bug Hall), is caught romancing Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes).Fearful she has bewitched their star go-kart driver, Spanky (Travis Tedford), club president, sends his affiliates, Porky (Zachary Mabry) and Buckwheat (Ross Bagley), to break them up before the big race.Unfortunately, the new kid in town (Blake McIver Ewing) may beat them to it.With a capricious script, apt casting and barrels of monkeyshines, this update of the comedy shorts is stupendously goofy.Incidentally, why are these rascals running wild? Shouldn't they be at home on the couch playing video games? (Yellow Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.com",The Little Rascals
6,ironhorse_iv,"Little Rascals is indeed charming, but don't kid yourself, this movie is heavily flaw, as well. Still, it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I like it.",6,31 August 2017,"In the 1990s, it seems like every major movie studio in Hollywood, was making remakes of classic adventures TV shows about neighborhood kids from mid-1930s to the late 1960s. Some of them, were minor hits; others were horrible retellings like 1993's 'Dennis the Menace'. However, the majority of them, fall between all-time best great & super awful. 1994's 'Little Rascals' is one, such mediocre film. The movie directed by Penelope Spheeris was a little too bog down on nostalgia; that it felt like a series of various sketches, oddly cobbled together, in a paper-thin set up about Spanky McFarland (Travis Tedford) trying to sabotage, one of his members, Alfalfa Switzer (Bug Hall)'s relationship with Darla Hood (Brittany Ashton Holmes), in order to get him, focus back on track, on winning the local go-cart derby race. It just doesn't mesh well. Plus, all of the sketches really does slow the pacing of the movie, down. A good example is all the scenes of the gang trying to make money, in order to rebuild their burn down clubhouse like the bank & freak-show scenes. None of those sequences were really that funny, nor makes any of much sense with the main plot; seeing how the gang have enough material to build another go-cart, yet not enough for a clubhouse. Honestly, the driving force of the plot could had been simple down to the idea, that the race had a prize money, all-along. It would save the movie, a lot of time. Also, as much as I love the ballet & soap singing scenes, those moments weren't really needed. It does feel a bit forced. It could had been cut, if Universal really wanted it, like they did with their VHS & DVD releases; when it came down to other scenes. Many of these versions, are so unlike the original movie, we saw in theaters. However, most of them, works better in watchable. Don't get me wrong, I do like seeing the familiar of sight gags and slapstick situations, taken straight from the original series of comedy short films produced by Hal Roach from 1922 to 1944, even if its bit sexism & anti-homosexual. However, I do wish they add more uniqueness with them. Some of the humor seem a bit repetitive, recycled & outdated. Even, when they did try something new, like updating the source material to a modern setting background. It still came across as somewhat jarring, because how the children is dressed in 1930s style of clothing. If anything, the movie should had, kept the 1930s settlings, just add new jokes to counteract, scenes, mirroring shorts like 1937's 'Hearts are Thumps & 1939's 'Auto Antics'. Furthermore, the movie should add more scenes of the children acting like themselves, rather than imitating adult. Lots of the big wordy dialogue given here, sounds so unnatural, coming from the mouth of a small child. I kinda wish, the movie gave them, simpler sentences to speak. This film really lacks the raw nuances of child performers acting like real children. Nevertheless, not all things, about this film, were bad. I do like how the cast is more integrated and less racist than the original. Also, the main actors were not that bad. Bug Hall & Travis Tedford were born for these roles. There are also some great cameos from Reba McEntire, Mel Brooks, and Lea Thompson to name a few. Even the sight of future president, Donald Trump wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, I would love to see, more cameos from past 'Little Rascals' alumnus, like Jackie Cooper, Eugene Jackson & Robert Blake in minor roles in this film. Sadly, this movie was lacking some of those. However, the movie makes it up with action set pieces with great stunt work. The Go-Kart race was somewhat compelling to watch, even if it's a bit over the top. Also, the soundtrack by composer, William Ross that goes with it, and most of the movie, really does seem like it came from yesteryear. It's beautiful to listen to. In short, while, 1994's 'Little Rascals' will never outdo the original short films from the 1930s/1940s. It does beat 1936's 'General Spanky' & 2014's 'The Little Rascals Save the Day' in being a better 'Our Gang' film. Overall: Watching a kid movie like this is like watching a blender without a lid. It's messy, but it's cool to witness. I highly recommended seeing the film. I kid you not.",The Little Rascals
7,UniqueParticle,Love this heartwarming movie so much!,9,5 April 2019,"Such a sweet kids' feel-good cute flick, love all the characters and the wonderful fun things the kids do throughout.

8,pmtelefon,Younger viewers will enjoy,5,26 January 2019,"The original Little Rascals movies were made for children but they never felt like it. There something about those movies that makes every age group enjoy them. I guess funny is funny. This ""The Little Rascals"" movie was made for children. That's the audience. There's nothing wrong with that. Fans of the original movies will get bored after a while. They won't get angry but they will lose interest. Younger children will get a kick out of it. That's fine with me.",The Little Rascals
9,helpless_dancer,brats run amok,7,18 October 2000,"I laughed my head off at these ill behaved little rapscallions. However, in the real world I would have cheerfully kicked their rascally little butts. Nothing realistic about the behavior of these kids at all, but I don't think that was intended. Lots of zany antics [some re-done from the old shorts from years back] and many belly laughs left me feeling good after the film was over. Thumbs up.",The Little Rascals
10,matthewssilverhammer,Otay,6,2 June 2020,"I gotta admit, for all the worth we put in actual filmic accomplishments, there's something undeniably pure about just liking something because you like it, the way a kid does. In that vein, there is 0 value in this movie; narratively, thematically, artistically, even humorously...that is, unless you're a kid...and maybe that's enough. It certainly was for me in 95, and I guess some of that Goodwill has stuck around for 25 years.",The Little Rascals
11,lisafordeay,A silly kids movie from my childhood that's so charming,6,14 October 2019,"The Little Rascals was a big household in my family when I was a kid and having not seen it in years I decided to watch it again.The story is about a gang of little boys who own a no girls allowed house and love playing mischief. However one of the little boys Alfonso is madly in love with Daryla and would do anything to win her over. Will he get her back?
Overall it's a real guilty pleasure movie. Sure it's silly and for a cast that is made up of 6 year olds or less they were actually both cute and hilarious.
If you've got kids and you enjoy them acting like grown ups then check it out.Keep an eye out for Back To The Future's Lea Thompson as a Ballet dancer,Daryl Hannah as Mrs Crabtree and Rebel McEntre.",The Little Rascals
12,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent film adaptation of a classic film series,10,19 January 2006,"THE LITTLE RASCALS, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of a classic film series. If you ask me, the way that Alfalfa (Bug Hall) fell for Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes) was absolutely romantic. When they were together in a scene, I felt really warm and tingly inside. However, when they had a fight, I wanted to cry. It's hard for me to explain the reasons for this. Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked Alfalfa's the best. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances to any fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",The Little Rascals
13,davispittman,Good considering the source material and audience,7,2 April 2018,"The Little Rascals (1994) has a certain target audience. I kept that target audience in mind while watching. I also kept the source material in mind as i watched. When you take both those important factors in mind, the film is pretty well done and it fits. The child actors fit their characters very well and they did a good job. All the mannerisms and characteristics were upheld. I liked seeing the big star cameos, such as Lea Thompson, Whoopi Goldberg, Reba and more. The comedy was at the level of the target audience, full of children's humor. That's why i say that this film is well made for it's demographic. It is in the children and family genre and i think it's a good fit for that.A lot of older teens and adults most likely won't be interested, but I suggest this one as a pretty good pick. Might wanna skip the Donald Trump cameo though lol. 7/10.",The Little Rascals
14,TOMNEL,"I hate films that try to be cute, but I don't hate this.",7,9 September 2011,"Films and television shows that are trying to be cute to gain laughs can be quite irritating. They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is ""Aaawwww!"" (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these ""little rascals"" live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way.Little Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is in a group of girl-hating little boys, and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo (Blake Ewing) has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing, so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the up-coming go-cart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back, in addition to beat Waldo, and bond with his child pal Spanky (Travis Tedford).This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors, and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there, and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say (though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life) are said with enough conviction, yet with a clear wink from the director and writer(s). The kids say their lines well, but with a slightly over the top script, and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace, with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child (at least they were to me!). The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids, but at the same time, it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense, but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end, giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it comes off as normal in this universe, and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top, play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here, it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny, but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways, so they won't understand that these are cameos.Overall, this is a very enjoyable family film, with good performances (from kids no less), and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House, I probably cringe about 10 times, but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins, there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun.My rating: *** out of ****. 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.",The Little Rascals

17,aesgaard41,Wonderful And Magical Nostalgia,10,4 April 2001,"This is a very enjoyable movie for any fan of the Rascals. It's curious that there could be children living among 90s references who dress in clothes from fifty years ago, but then this could just be a tiny mid-western town. These boys are so disillusioned with girls, probably because of stereotypes created by their fathers, that they create a club just to alienate females and act what they think macho is. And then walks Alfalfa who has found his female side and is secure in it. The magic of the kid's world as it percieves adults is wonderfully portrayed by these young actors. Bug Hall, Travis Tedford and Kevin Holmes are wonderful in their roles and should go far as actors, but Brittany Holmes, cute as she is, doesn't have the charm of the original Darla Hood. The movie does copy the original charm of the series as it duplicates all of the most memorable scenes and creates new ones as well. The cameos of Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are wonderful, but no where as memorable as the ones by George Wendt, Mel Brooks, Whoopi Goldberg, Lea Thompson, Donald Trump, Darryl Hannah and Reba McEntire. The bloopers at the end are cute but unnecessary, but it is a shame that a tv series couldn't have been spawned out of all of this.",The Little Rascals

21,zac-04879,"Revolting Sexism, Cheap Innuendo, Super Flat Idea",1,17 July 2021,"People go on that audiences who didn't enjoy The Little Rascals were awaiting strong and inspirational thoughts out of a childish kids' classic. The thing is, we were obviously expecting exactly what was provided. However, the sexism and unfunny innuendo is frequent and appalling. Whatever director Penelope Spheeris thought she was gonna achieve failed and turned out as a dumb, cheap laugh.Young children usually adore films like this, featuring loads of slapstick humour and boy vs. Girl sexism. As they get older and more childish films like this movie release, it all starts to get really boring and old. There's enough clownish family comedies like The Little Rascals, and the older kids want more than farts, burps and pratfalls.Also, the film is really flat. Yeah it's definitely an ages-6-and-up film, but it's completely unfunny and unoriginal. There's constantly stupid humour and innuendo throughout.

It would be years before I saw it again but I like it even more now.The film did not receive positive reviews and most considered it to be an average movie at the most, but in my opinion the film is above average. The film has a very 'cuteness' feel to it. You have children acting as if they were adults and actual adults rarely appear in the film or have a small contribution to the plot. It's entertaining to watch the romantic relationship between Alfalfa and Darla. It made me warm and tingly inside!

23,Mike-DD,Rascally hilarious,8,25 August 2000,"I enjoy movies where kids are the main stars, and except for a few, have always highly rated them. This ranks as one of the better ones I've seen. Though I never had the chance to watch the series, I can imagine how hilarious it must have been judging from the movie. The antics of the group of young boys and girls in their eternal 'war' against one another is uproarious and a delight to watch. Watch how one of the boys try to stay within the girl-hating club while trying to woo a girl at the same time - it'll remind some of us of our childhood just before we enter adolescence. Fact is, I think the parents would probably enjoy this just as much for the same reason - how cute we were before we became 'teen horrors'!!",The Little Rascals

I will always loove this movie and it is a great movie for kids and adults. It is a classic and it will always be a classic.

Of course, I do know the source material well, since I grew up in the sixties when the old ""Our Gang"" and ""Little Rascal"" comedies were used to fill TV time.My own opinion of this film now barely counts, because I've seen the surprisingly large number of user reviews showing a level of tenderness and emotion about this movie that I find touching. Plus, my ten-year old loves it.

28,skiddoo,"showed this today, in half hour chunks, to six classes--k through 5th",8,3 April 2017,"I hadn't seen it before but didn't mind watching it twice all the way through, unlike a lot of movies for kids. Some grades were just as icky squirmy over the kisses as the boys in the club. The older kids got more of the jokes but not as many as I did. The younger kids and older kids loved the action. I liked the end where Darla gets tough with the rich kid (with Trump saying he was the best son money could buy!!), and the girls and boys find they have similar interests and can be friends, which was the resolution of the conflict set up by the boys only club as all the boys are converted to appreciating girls. For an adult, it was fun to identify the stars that studded the movie. None of my classes showed any recognition of any of the stars, including Trump. I didn't give it a 10 because I didn't need some of the words in the race scene (words deemed ""not appropriate"" in our school), and some of the writing seemed too adult, even suggestive which was borderline creepy and shouldn't have been included for adults to catch in a children's story, and too modern for me to suspend disbelief all the time. The acting was excellent; even the animals did well. I'm not a fan of updating shows but this one worked for me. And more than that, it worked for the kids.

30,trixie-k-88,90's Reboot of the Rascals,6,16 October 2012,"Ah, the 90's remake of the Hal Roach shorts from the Great Depression. I liked this movie as a child and most other kids I knew enjoyed it too. Butas an adult I feel differently about it.Spanky (Travis Tedford) and his best friend Alfalfa (Bug Hall) are the founders of the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club, a club of little boys who get together and do ""boy"" things without girls. But when Alfalfa falls in puppy love with a girl named Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), Spanky and his other friends do everything to sabotage the relationship. And when Alfalfa accidentally burns down their clubhouse the other boys have completely had it with him, and force him to guard their prized go-cart day and night. Meanwhile, Darla has fallen for a new rich boy Waldo (Blake McIver Ewing), but Alfalfa is still determined to get her back. Everything boils down to the local fair when the boys try to win the go-cart derby, raise enough money to rebuild the clubhouse, and mend broken friendships.This movie isweak. The plot itself isn't that bad, and most children who watch it are entertained, but it's just not good. The overwhelming problem with this film is that none of the kids can act their way out of a paper bag. The fact that none of the kids have been in anything more than a few made for TV or straight to video movies since this proves that. Honestly I found the outtakes of the kids' mistakes funnier than the movie itself. In terms of being based off the original ""Little Rascals"" shorts, they don't have much to do with them aside from the same looks and names as the originals. That being said it's hard to relate children of the 90s to children of the 20's, 30's and 40's. A lot of the old ones are based on poverty, hunger, and child abuse as a part of their lives, along with other themes that were anachronistic or not applicable to children of the 90's. But they tried to integrate some themes like the go cart derby, Alfalfa singing and the He-Man-Woman-Haters Club. With that all said this is still a movie that would entertain most children under ten, but can quickly get annoying for parents that have to sit through it with them.",The Little Rascals
31,DiamondGirl427,Kids Will Always Like This...,5,24 July 2010,"A friend of mine has a son...who when he was little...looked exactly like Bug Hall..who plays ""Alfalfa"" in the film. She laughed herself silly watching it..and invited me over to see it as well. As someone who loved the old original ""Our Gang"" shorts...I was happy to go watch this. I thought it was funny, cute and very entertaining. Yes..it was silly as well..but it was about kids doing kid things. Granted..in a modern setting..kids doing these mischievous things would have been in major trouble with any adult that might have been passing by. Parents would have been notified...police called..well, you know the rest. However..there were very few parents in evidence anywhere during most of the scenes. Kids allowed to roam all over town alone? It just was not safe really...but in the ""Our Gang"" films it was O-Tay...bad guys simply did not exist as they do today. I imagine getting these little kids to do as the director wanted was not easy. Distractions would be everywhere on a movie set. I know in the originals they would say and do mean things to the kids to get them to cry on cue...that was long before there were rules and laws against it. In this..most of the kids looked like they were having fun. Hopefully, they were. Funny this is..none of this kids probably ever heard or saw any of the stuff the original kids did way back when until this film came into being. The casting was really good...especially ""Spanky"" and ""Alfalfa""...they fit just right. Adding cameos with Donald Trump and Woopie Goldburg could have been left out...I wasn't quite sure why they were necessary here. It is a feel-good movie that I believe all kids will enjoy at least once..and when they have kids someday...they will like it too. I hope they do not do any re-makes of this film. It was kind of a homage to the old shorts...but now it has been done...so leave them alone. :)",The Little Rascals

33,AsherPuth,Misogyny as a norm.,3,13 April 2021,This movie has a constant theme of anti-feminism and misogyny. The boys in this movie are constantly saying degrading things of women and may teach your kids to be disrespectful towards the opposite sex. A classic film of hatred among the sexes.,The Little Rascals
34,kelly-meg340,Cute for its time,10,23 August 2018,When I was a kid I watched this repeatedly. I believe all kids would enjoy this movie at some point. It was made 24 years ago so give it a break! It is a little corny and the acting is okay but kids don't catch that stuff. I still love watching it with my kids. In fact im watching it with them now :),The Little Rascals
35,Jamiec523,Very Special and Rememberable film!,7,16 September 2009,To this day I can still remember seeing this film for the first time. I was about 7 and I thought it was so great. I am now nearly 21 and I still love this film. The casting is great and the acting was great for kids that young. The story was surprisingly well done as well! Probably adults won't enjoy this film as much but I think a good amount will. I definitely think kids will enjoy this film more then adults but as I said I am now an adult and I still am grateful to own this movie.I rate is 7/10 because there were some points in this film that were a bit unrealistic and a bit too silly. However I still think this film is great7/10,The Little Rascals
36,IslandMyst,Enjoy it for what it is...,6,7 January 2020,"I see both people comparing this film to ones intended for older audiences and people comparing the film to the original 1930s series.Kids movies, and most movies for that matter, made in the early 90s were not made to be realistic. They were just done for laughs. Does anyone complain about Home Alone being unrealistic with an 8 year old thwarting two armed thugs over and over? No. Possibly because it was a much better movie.However, to complain that this movies isn't like the 1930s series is also laughable in and of itself. I mean, what would you have them do? Film it in black and white? Reinsert long pauses between lines? Even poorer quality acting? Make it less comprehensible?Go watch an episode from the 30s, then imagine sitting through that for 110 minutes in the era of online streaming. Forget even that. This movie came out in the era after, Aladdin, Hook, The Lion King, Home Alone, The Sandlot, just to name a few, and people want 1930s style comedy back?You'd think the original was on par with Game of Thrones for the time it was made the way some people are talking. Not to mention the overt racism. Literally dressing black character 'Buckwheat' who they literally dress up like a clown and talks in incoherent slave speak. Want that back too?All that said, the original show was meant to be endearing and it is. As is this 1994 remake. I don't like to use the excuse, 'it's made for kids' as an excuse for poor artistry, but at the same time you can't expect something like this to be Citizen Kane. You gotta take it for what it is, and what it is, is still a mediocre guilty pleasure with many funny moments that you can watch in the background and be moderately entertained if you turn your brain off.If you're looking for a similar film that's much more well done, I would recommend watching the Sandlot.",The Little Rascals
37,joshwinkler87,A very fun movie that both kids and adults should like!,8,20 May 2010,"I liked the film ""The Little Rascals"" ever since my parents took me to see it at the theater in 1994 when I was 6. It would be years before I saw it again but I like it even more now.The film did not receive positive reviews and most considered it to be an average movie at the most, but in my opinion the film is above average. The film has a very 'cuteness' feel to it. You have children acting as if they were adults and actual adults rarely appear in the film or have a small contribution to the plot. It's entertaining to watch the romantic relationship between Alfalfa and Darla. It made me warm and tingly inside! I won't spoil the movie for you, but if you haven't seen this classic, do check it out.",The Little Rascals
38,saujanya13,Child Version of the adults world,7,17 May 2013,"This movie is a heart warming tale of little children. A boy and a girl likes each other and wants to live together, same like most of the movies about love. They face a rough patch mainly due to the boy being a member of 'girl haters' club. His friends tries to help get the girl out of his life, in which they succeed. But the boy tries to get her back, who falls for a new to town rich guy.It's the same struggle of a poor guy trying to get back his girl fighting against a rich powerful opponent. As many of the stories most might have seen , the story offers nothing different than most. The only reason to watch this movie might be because it has been performed by bunch of kids, which is very beautifully put forward on screen.In the end of the story Well known celebrities are shown as the parents of the kids in the story, the facial resemblance gets us to believe they are really their children.",The Little Rascals

Two years ago, when I was 10, me and my best buddy ""Kempsy"" as we called him loved cheesy kids movies from the 90s. ""The Little Rascals"" was one of them. Earlier this week, I found my old VHS copy of this at the bottom of my cupboard. I dusted it off, popped it in my VCR, and watched. I DEMAND THOSE 77 MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK! This truly was one of the worst movies ever. Its cheesy, corny, and all other words describing foods that can also be used to describe an excruciatingly bad movie. Me and Kempsy watched many a bad movie, but we loved them back then! Good Burger is OK, Slappy and the Stinkers is even worse, and The Little Rascals is the corniest of them all.

44,michellecampbell246,Spin Off of the Original 'Our Gang.',8,26 September 2013,"Granted, more than half of the children were terrible actors. Most of them sounded coached and rehearsed, the movements were for the most part awkward and very unnatural, and some of them even looked into the camera throughout most of the movie. But that's what made it relatable to Us children of the '90s. It was definitely a spin off of the ""Our Gang"" serious from the Depression Era, however it was made to be modern with a few familiar twists. They were '90s Kids doing what Kids do! Just like the 'Our Gang' children were Kids doing Kid things from that era!Even though there were some copies from the original in the movie, it was all in good fun. Remember, it is a CHILDREN/family movie. I grew up watching both 'The Little Rascals' and 'Our Gang' and I don't think that the Little Rascals ""disgraced"" 'Our Gang' in any way whatsoever. Yes, there were similarities and some ""copy catting,"" but so what? It is after all a Children's movie about Children doing things that Children like to do in their time frame. I didn't try to get too elaborate or lengthy with this because I'm simply defending the simplicity and innocence of the movie from old cranky grown ups & sell outs.",The Little Rascals
45,partham,Best Kid movie I have ever seen,10,1 April 2011,"How come this movie have got only 5.6, it should be above 7.5 at least ? My rating is 10/10!!!My wife recommended this movie 3 years back. Though I must admit I was not very much interested to watch this, still rented the DVD. As soon as I start watching, immediately I came to know my wife was right. I cannot think of a single portion of a movie which can get better. The child stars are phenomenal, The storyline could get no better - I cant believe my eyes how come the kids deliver such a perfect actions - the direction just took my breath away.Its the best children movie I have ever seen and my recommendation if for all ages.

46,Hobbes-15,"Think Ewoks without fur, these kids are hilarious.",8,30 December 1998,"This is by far the best ensemble of child actors ever.  These kids are insanely cute and just hilarious.  I've seen the original Little Rascals and it doesn't compare to the updated version.  This is by no means a family movie just for kids, I've seen a group of college students lose it watching this show.  Think Denice the Menace meets Little Orphan Annie.  The movie follows a group of seven year olds who are members of the He-Man Women Haters club.  It deals with such heavy topics as why girls are gross, what makes a truly great go-cart and what being a man in the 90's is all about. Give Little Rascals a watch and you'll remember how great childhood can be.",The Little Rascals

You had to see it. I almost wanted to lash out at certain magazines and other reviewers as they only gave this film a 1 star rating (out of 5) What's not to like about this movie? Okay, so the acting wasn't exactly high standard but they were kids! and they did a good enough job for my liking! I am still using some of their quotes to this day and I am in College for Christs' sake. As jokes people will accuse me of something and ask me how I plead. ""Like this"" is the reply I am always giving. Even when i wake up in the morning with a section of hair sticking up I always have my mum saying ""You have the hair of that boy of that kids film...Alfonso"" For the last time it's ALFALFA!!!! -Waves hand beneath chin-",The Little Rascals
49,medusa211,"Great Movie, Bad Acting!",7,15 April 2007,"I have to say, if I have to rate this movie based on my children's opinion, it will definitely, qualify as an Oscar masterpiece.. However, after watching it at least 10 times with them, I can't help but wonder how most of the kids in the movie were picked to act in it. With the exception of Alfalfa and the two cute black kids, the acting was horrible, esp. Darla!. Darla was looking at the camera a couple of times. Spanky's expressions and hand motions were too awkward and looked rehearsed. There was a few kids in the ""club"" that did not sing or even make any facial expressions of enthusiasm or otherwise. The monkey, on the hand, was great! Also, I thought some parts of the script were,awkward and the lines sounded unnatural for a child to say. With the bad acting I saw, it seemed as if there was a serious shortage of talent amongst the kids they had to cast from. The movie theme was ideal for boys (especially) and girls between the ages of 4 and 7. Having said all that,overall the movie is quite entertaining, I wish they'd make a new version of it with many sequels.",The Little Rascals

52,lin327,"my 3 year old loves it, but should he?",6,9 July 2008,"My son is almost 4 years old and has repeatedly watched this movie so many times that he can recite line after line. At first I thought how cute, but then he repeated the note one of Alfalfa's ""woman hater"" friends read to Darla...""Dear Darla, I hate your stinking guts. You make me vomit. You're scum between my toes."" My son started to recite that out in public. It seemed that many lines in the movie that he picked up to repeat were ones that he shouldn't. ""I'm really gonna kick your butt."" (With his fist in the air). I don't think I would have gotten this for my 3 year old had I known what would transpire. It is a very cute movie but I'm not sure some of the language is appropriate. I'm not a fan of ""woman haters club"" either. Live and learn. ps.

53,cherrymarie200,doesn't even come close to the originals,4,25 May 2009,"When I was little, I liked this movie. I had only seen a few of the original Our Gang (Little Rascals) shorts and I didn't really know the difference between them. I watched this movie again recently and, I must say, it was horrible. I am sort of obsessed with the original Our Gangs, and this movie was nothing compared to them. A lot of people have said ""The acting wasn't that great, but what can you expect, they're kids?"" I say, they found kids for the originals that were genius actors, so why couldn't they find any for the movie? Also, why did they mix together all the different time periods? Mary Ann Jackson (the little girl with the bobbed dark brown hair) left the shorts long before Porky ever joined them and they were both in the movie. There were some good moments in the movie, like when Spanky's wig got pulled off by a tree, but the horrible acting and the way they messed with basically the whole idea of Our Gang overshadows the good moments. And now, when I mention in casual conversation that I like the Little Rascals, inevitably, someone will say ""Oh, yeah, I liked that movie too!"" and start singing ""I've got a pickle, I've got a pickle!"" or something similar. I'm being generous and giving the movie four out of ten stars because I liked it when I was little. I know I've gone on a long nasty rant, but that's really what I think about the movie. Also, I'm not sure if this has any spoilers, but I didn't want to be blacklisted, so I put the notice in, just to be sure.",The Little Rascals
54,crazyhaz,'Pocket Ninjas was far better',2,15 November 2009,"Yes, it seriously was. I'm not joking. I would rather tattoo 'Pocket Ninjas 4 life' across my chest with Brad Bufanda's face beneath it. Luckily, throughout the movie I was considerably stoned, and if I hadn't been, I probably would have gone downtown with a knife looking for something to kill. This movie made me the most angry I had ever been, which is surprising because I never get angry. Anyway...The movie starts out with a gang of homosexual children (who fear women more than having acid thrown in their faces) who are members of a club located in some decrepit shed, the proprietor (a 7 year old child) not in the least concerned about the state of the shed, nor what could be lurking inside it. This is just one mistake that the producers made, out of hundreds, most of them can be called 'Common sense & logic deficiency error'. There are so many factual errors, continuity errors, audio errors, and any type of error within this movie that there are at least 3 happening at any given moment, from start to finish. For a start, what kind of parent would let their 7 year old child roam free through wherever they are (Detroit?) and get pursued by a pair of crackhead 12 year old mulletheads, congregate within a shed that's falling to pieces, and follow a child called Alfalfa trying to get him to leave a joke of a relationship he has with -holds breath- a girl. I lost track of the movie from around that time. Had I been alone, I would have started screaming at the television. Had I taken acid, I would have died. Actually, if you gave me anything (sedatives, benzo's) something would have been stabbed or broken. Had someone injected a pound of crystallized Valium directly into my brain, I still would have gone into some hysterical stabbing frenzy.Maybe.",The Little Rascals
55,jmeredith3,Little Rascals Summary,6,13 December 2011,"Little Rascals is a movie that is filled with childlike grudges, wars, competition, camaraderie and reconciliation. Every great group has had to overcome obstacles in order to develop and maintain their strength. The He- Man Women Haters Club is filled with tension and animosity towards members between the group and the infamous Darla that snatched the heart of Alfalfa.Loyalty is very important to the members of the He-Man Woman Haters club. Although Alfalfa is tested and tried throughout the movie by his comrades and his childhood crush; he prevails. Spanky, the best friend of Alfalfa is infuriated by the discreet passions that his friend Alfalfa possesses for the young lady Darla. Throughout the movie, Darla and Alfalfa try to establish a bond, but they are always interrupted, whether it is by pranks of Women's Hater's Club, or rich guys such as Waldo that crept into Darla's life to take away the feelings that she had for Alfalfa.Often, in the movie the producer showed a great sense of the lack of knowledge or understanding that kids possess and how they often think without speaking. It was funny to see how the kids wanted to meet the race car driver at the end of the championship and to see how they were disgruntled because they expected to see a man. Surprisingly, the person that presented the prize to the Woman Haters Club, was the person that the gang had desired to meet along. The surprise just lied in the fact that the person was a woman and not a man. Not to mention, Spanky's disgust for women was challenged when he asked the female race car driver to give him a kiss on his cheek.Movies such as Little Rascals are rarities in 2011. Most of the films that we see today are filled with sex, violence, and theft. Even the kids are the ones committing the very acts in the movie, and it is saddening. One of my favorite movies of all time that has a similar prank-like feature assimilated into the film is ""Home Alone"". The movie Home Alone is filled with pranks and laughter for the entire family and if you enjoyed Little Rascals, you will probably enjoy. Home Alone.",The Little Rascals

With our hyper-sexualized society the way it is, I don't see the point and adding to it in a children's movie.",The Little Rascals
