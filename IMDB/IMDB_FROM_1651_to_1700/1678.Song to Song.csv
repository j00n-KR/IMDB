0,TheLittleSongbird,'Song to Song' just doesn't sing,4,24 August 2017,"This review is not coming from a Terrence Malick detractor. In fact he is a director that falls for me in the ""appreciate very highly"" category.His first five films were either very good ('The New World'), great('Badlands') and outstanding ('The Thin Red Line', 'Days of Heaven' and 'The Tree of Life'). Certainly don't anything at all against anybody who doesn't like those films or Malick in general, as Malick has a very unique, unconventional style that also isn't widely accessible, his films unlike many seen before or since, something that will entice a lot and perplex others. Was very much mixed on his next two films 'To the Wonder' and 'Knight of Cups', but they had good qualities.'Song to Song', as of now from personal opinion, is Malick's worst. It is the film that connected with me the least, engaged me the least (never watch a film expecting entertainment from all of them, instead judging them in what they set out to do) and perplexed me the most. Do have to disagree respectfully that it is his most accessible film, 'Badlands' and 'Days of Heaven' are stronger contenders for that. If anything, as well as being his least ambitious ('The Tree of Life'), 'Song to Song' is the film that will alienate audiences the most.It is not without good things. Again from personal opinion, none of Malick's films are 1/10 films and none of them are close to being among the worst films ever made let alone THE worst. As always with Malick, 'Song to Song' does look absolutely stunning, the cinematography (not surprising considering one of the best cinematographers around Emmanuel Lubezki was responsible) has a very dream-like quality to it, the colours positively leap out at you in an eye-popping way and the scenery has a sweeping beauty.Every single one of Malick's films are among the most beautiful films visually I've seen, with every frame having a breathtakingly naturalistic quality without feeling too orchestrated. The music gives an audibly rich, overwhelmingly emotional and quite haunting quality, fitting perfectly with everything on screen.When it comes to the acting, Ryan Gosling, Rooney Mara and Michael Fassbender do great jobs. Mara especially is wonderful, her face and eyes say so much and all when she is saying little. Malick's style is unmistakable and is all over the film, and it is clear that he has put a lot of thought into his directing.As was said with 'To the Wonder' and 'Knight of Cups', he is not entirely successful sadly. His directing has a thoughtful and philosophical touch, but did get the sense that he was trying too hard and that he was focusing too much on some aspects and not enough on others. Not everybody comes off well in the acting, Iggy Pop was just bizarre and out of place and while Cate Blanchett does her best she has very little to do, a waste of a great actress.Regarding the voice overs, they are easily the worst voice overs in any of Malick's films. Not in how the actors deliver them, it's the way they are written that's the problem. They strive to be poetic, instead they are self-indulgent (""pretentious"" is one of my most hated words now so won't be using that) and preachy, some of them do not flow well at all. There is a succession dream-like moments, some are very dreamy and beautiful but most are fragmented and endless. Spontaneity actually feels like stilted improvisation, authenticity is little and shape is even less.Didn't engage with the characters really (apart from Mara's, but that was more to do with Mara's acting), most of them seemed disconnected and in a few cases pointless. 'Song to Song' is Malick at his most disjointed and dullest (a more preferable adjective to replace another one of my most hated words ""boring"", like ""pretentious"" it's overused and abused here).It was the story, or lack of, and the pace that most underwhelmed. Do not have a problem with slow pacing, Malick's films are deliberately meditative and some of my favourite films are the same. But when the story came across as emotionally empty and disjointed, very like 'To the Wonder' and 'Knight of Cups' except they didn't leave me as stone cold as here, and mostly indecipherable (anybody will be forgiven having a hard time describing the plot let alone figuring it out) as well as the again personal themes barely developed it was impossible to engage with it. Thus making it a chore to sit through, even with 'To the Wonder' and 'Knight of Cups' faults they didn't make me feel this way anywhere near as much.Overall, very disappointing and just doesn't sing. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Song to Song
1,SnoopyStyle,confused disjointed beautiful,5,24 December 2017,"BV (Ryan Gosling) and Faye (Rooney Mara) are musicians. Cook (Michael Fassbender) is a producer. Rhonda (Natalie Portman) is a waitress. BV has a fling with Amanda (Cate Blanchett) and Faye with Zoey. These relationships start, conflict, stop, and detour in the Austin music scene.Terrence Malick continues to make these beautiful-looking dreamlike movies. It's beyond beauty but the story telling is muddled. His style of filmmaking is deliberately disjointed which makes all these complicated relationships hard to follow. It's also emotionally distant. Mara and Gosling have these droning voices which don't help in this case. It's a beautiful movie but the complicated relationship jumping loses me along the way. There is a bit guerrilla filmmaking as Malick steals scenes during real music festivals. This would work much better with fewer relationships.",Song to Song
2,Horst_In_Translation,"The actors alone cannot make it work, even if they come pretty close",4,2 July 2017,"""Song to Song"" is the newest movie by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Terrence Malick and it came out freshly this year, in 2017. If you take a look at the last decades, you will see that he was extremely unprolific most of the time, but since the gigantic success of ""The Tree of Life"", it is almost the opposite. Sadly, the consequence is that his films have become a bit like what you would call bulk if they were goods. And after being fairly disappointed by Knight of Cups 2 years ago, this one here is another disappointment overall, especially if you take a look at the cast he had at his disposal. Gosling, Mara, Portman and Fassbender are among the most famous Hollywood has to offer right now looking at the actors' respective age groups. And also in terms of smaller characters and performances, the film has to offer names like Blanchett, Kilmer, Hunter and other names you have certainly come across in other well-known films or other projects like for example singer Lykke Li, who proves she is a decent actress too. This really shows how much the best of the best want to work with Malick right now.So how did it go wrong eventually. Well, I guess it partially has to do with my subjective taste in films. Malick is Malick and he is different than everybody else. Be it his camera work where the camera is basically never still or the many scenes where you see the actors, but they are not really talking to each other and instead you get voice-overs giving us the characters' thought. Or be it the extremely poetic language that is a common denominator in all of Malick's works, it can be pretty difficult to get used to and even more difficult to appreciate his style. As for what I do not think is subjective approach is the inclusion of the music scene in this film. It was not really working at all. The kind of music in here goes strongly against Malick's calm, sensual approach to filmmaking and it creates a gap that is impossible to close in my opinion. Besides, the entire music background plot added very little in general. Especially Mara looked completely out of place in the second half when we see her on stage occasionally.But nonetheless, Mara, Fassbender and Portman prove they are among the finest actors from their generation and certainly good enough to star in high quality films and carry them. The trio even almost turned this film into a good watch. Mara was probably the one most in the center of it all and she was mesmerizing to watch. Fassbender did a good job too and he had some scenes that could have gone wrong with a less talented actor, but thanks to his range he makes stuff like the seagull scene not only work, but turns it into one of his best moments. And Portman started looking like a bimbo in her very first scene, but she managed the difficult task of turning her character into a highlight here. Her final scene and voice-over was perhaps the film's very best moment and could have been a worthy moment to finish the film too. or the ""Amen"" comment. But Malick really missed out big style on having the credits roll in at the right time. The very final part about Mara's and Gosling's character finding each other once again felt fake and unauthentic and like a forced happy ending that I totally could have done without. This may also have to do with the fact that Ryan Gosling (you may have realized I did not mention him with the others) was underwhelming again and I am just not a fan of him at all and his performance here sure can't change that. Honestly, to me he has the most smirky grin ever and I am baffled to see so many people falling for his one-dimensional routine again and again, for example also when it comes to his very recent Oscar-nominated and Golden-Globe winning turn.But back to this movie here. It is always with Malick visually stunning at times, but this only refers to the landscapes occasionally, not to all the party photography. But like all the poetic dialogues and voice-overs (that frequently did not fit the characters at all), there are more than just a few scenes that did not work at all and should have been left out. Just one very brief example: the deer scene where Malick clearly misses in terms of hitting the right spot. It may have been so metaphorical and symbolic on so many occasions, but what's the point if it doesn't make sense to anybody but the filmmaker himself. The consequence is that the self-important moments feel pretty fake at times and that I must agree with those who call the film overlong, pompous and pretentious. Which weren't too few as the general consensus for this film is not a positive one. I myself agree with these and give ""Song to Song"" another thumbs-down. Such a shame to see an outcome like this when you have such a mindblowingly strong cast at your disposal. Watch something else instead and I really hope that Malick's upcoming work will turn out better because if there is one German/European actor who finally deserves it to have a huge breakthrough in America, then it is August Diehl. Fingers crossed!",Song to Song
3,lee_eisenberg,"Cut it out, Malick!",1,30 October 2017,"Most directors turn out some great movies (Bananas, Schindler's List, Dr. Strangelove, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) and some terrible ones (Everyone Says I Love You, The Lost World, Eyes Wide Shut, Man on the Moon). Some (i.e., John Sayles) consistently turn out good movies, while others (i.e., Paul W.S. Anderson) appear to be on a mission to destroy cinema. But Terrence Malick is one of a kind: he has gotten progressively worse as a director. His debut ""Badlands"" was a masterpiece. His follow-up ""Days of Heaven"" was OK, not great. ""The Thin Red Line"" was well-intentioned but had a too narrow focus. ""The New World"" was too long and too slow. Malick continues this downward spiral with the forgettable ""Song to Song"". There's no plot here, just two hours of people thinking things that they want to say to each other. I don't know what possessed Ryan Gosling, Natalie Portman, Michael Fassbender and Rooney Mara to waste their time on something so bland and empty.Basically, it's the sort of pointless movie that you'll need to wash out of your memory with another movie (in my case, I watched ""An American Werewolf in London""). Terrence Malick is nothing but a hack. I don't know why anyone finances his pseudo-intellectual Oscar bait wannabe.",Song to Song
4,Quinoa1984,it was the best of Malick times... it was the WTF-worst of Malick times,4,29 March 2017,"On the one hand, I liked that, for what seems like the first time since The New World Malick has actors as characters in scenes where they, you know, have dialog exchanges and we get to see how they interact and learn about each other. It's not a lot of the time, but it shows that when Malick sat down with the actors and, whether it was improvised or not, got them to figure out how these people would talk to one another, whatever shades (or not) of depth there would be - and this isn't just the main cast but, say, small scenes between Mara's Faye and Faye's father, or BV (Gosling) with his mother, or any of Patti Smith's scenes - it's a joy to see these actors work off one another. If Malick had actually been working from a script, as opposed to no script at all, he might have had one of his best films.On the other hand, and I can't believe I'm saying this, I may be getting tired of ""Chivo"" Lubezki's cinematography, at least in this case after so many Malick films. It's a strange thing to say since when one sees The New World or especially The Tree of Life, they're nothing short of photographic tour-de-forces, things that we haven't seen in cinematic grammar before as far as how he uses the lenses and the natural light, at least in such a way as it is. But while he has the good instinct sometimes to push in or pull out on an actor when they're talking, and of course the light through (there are a lot of) windows, or outside, is beautiful (it can't help but be anything but and there's no synonyms left for it), I kind of wished there wasn't such a hodge-podge of technical approaches here. And meanwhile on the one hand this is a film that has Iggy Pop, Flea and Patti Smith in cameos (and Smith even gets to have something like a character, probably more than Holly Hunter or Cate Blanchett probably), and it certainly captures the Austin music scene with vitality and energy and gets how it's intoxicating to see the audience and to be so close to the stage or backstage and, to another extent, hanging around Michael Fassbender (who, despite working without a script net, shows why he's so good as an actor first, movie star second, understanding how to just be in a room looking and listening can have weight). Also all of the main cast have insanely good chemistry together, both physically and mentally (mostly physically), and I think Gosling and Mara are a good fit for a Malick world.On the other hand, this line: ""I don't like to see the birds in the sky because I'll miss you"" or this line ""Mercy was a word. I never thought I needed it."" Yeah.And, on top of the narration which is, mostly here, the absolute worst that Malick's had in his films - some of it's laughable, other times it's horrible, and even in Knight of Cups I didn't feel this way, though to an extent I did with 'Wonder' - I felt bad for actors in the second half of the movie who seemed adrift, maybe with more character material on the cutting room floor (there's another *six hours* of this), like Blanchett or Berenice Marlohe. Both of these women play the love interests of the respective Gosling and Mara characters after they split up (why they do would both take too long and not be worth the effort for its simplicity), but even compared to everyone else I didn't get a sense of who they were as people.I'm not talking about this as if it's a problem as far as something intentional that a filmmaker does where they leave some mystery with the people and we have to read into things (with Faye, I think Mara actually does a whole lot with a little, at least from what we can see, and her performance came the closest to making me care about a character on screen - I thought almost the same could've been for Portman's Rhonda, but she leaves the film for so long stretches I forgot that her conflict was so shallow, but I digress). What I mean is more that I had no idea why the two ex-lovebirds would go with these people, what they mean to them, what they do for them, and why Blanchett's character becomes so sad for not much reason (BV's mother warns him off of her at one point because... she's sad, that's it), and Marlohe gets even less.So with Song to Song, I know it sounds like I'm coming down on it harshly, but it's because I expect a great deal from this director, and want him to do well. The problem though in general is that at 129 minutes it feels too long, which is a strange thing to note considering that there's, I must stress, SIX OTHER HOURS of footage, so I'm not sure if it could use being like 20 even 30 minutes shorter, or another hour longer or so. There's scenes that get surprisingly close to the emotional depths that Malick could get at back in his prime 70's days with his actors, and they're game for making a romance film full of highs and lows. But the more ""Malick"" touches with how memories and impressions and nature and the city of Austin and who knows what else blends in with the story is hit or miss at best and distractingly precious and bad at worst (I probably neglected to write down other glaringly dumb lines).",Song to Song
5,blanbrn,"Typical Malick like film that's long drawn out looking at life, change, love, and experimentation.",6,7 October 2017,"Mostly I try to watch the movies of Terrence Malick and they like this one ""Song to Song"" are about thought as they are long and drawn out stories of life and choices with interactions as love and interest change with people as much of it is about location and timing.Set in Austin, Texas this picture revolves around the young alternative music scene in which two struggling songwriters BV(Ryan Gosling)and Faye(Rooney Mara)are trying their best to break into the music business with the help from a mogul named Cook(Michael Fassbender). Thru it all the lives of each are turned upside down as to begin with BV and Faye have a relationship that's intimate with sex yet things change when BV returns to an ex flame and Faye starts to explore and try to find out who she is in the bedroom as she runs an experimentation with another woman for some hot passionate sex! Now Cook tries his shake with Rhonda(Natalie Portman) a young waitress yet nothing doesn't really go to float. Thru it all each character makes a discovery about life, love, people, as the experimentation and intersection with one another all leads to a mix of seduction and betrayal as each learn the game of life and see what's in it for them as BV returns to his blue collar roots and leaves the music business.Overall long take and spin on interaction, experimentation, and life choices proving that chance, timing, luck, location and passion all play a part in shaping one as life can be a fun experiment.",Song to Song
6,Hellmant,I hope Terrence Malick finds his way again soon!,8,15 August 2017,"'SONG TO SONG': Four Stars (Out of Five)Acclaimed writer/director Terrence Malick's new movie about the love affairs between two lyricists, a music mogul, and a waitress; all set against the backdrop of the Austin, Texas music scene. It stars Rooney Mara, Ryan Gosling, Michael Fassbender, Natalie Portman, Cate Blanchett, Holly Hunter and Val Kilmer. The film also contains cameos from such famous musicians as Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Florence Welch and The Black Lips (plus many others). Actors cut from the final edit of the movie include Christian Bale, Haley Bennett and Benicio del Toro (plus others). The film received extremely mixed reviews from critics, and it only got a very limited indie theatrical release at the Box Office (I don't think it played anywhere near me). I found it to be about as good as Malick's last two movies, but definitely nowhere close to as great as his best work.BV (Gosling) and Faye (Mara) are two musicians, and song writers, that meet at a party thrown by music mogul Cook (Fassbender). They hit it off, and BV begins working for Cook. Cook also becomes fascinated with a local waitress, named Rhonda (Portman), who he quickly showers with expensive gifts and affection. The movie intertwines these different relationship stories, plus many others, all against the backdrop of the Austin, Texas music scene.I'm a big fan of 'THE TREE OF LIFE' (it was one of my favorite films of 2011), and for the most part I've really liked, and respected, all of Malick's work before that. 2012's 'TO THE WONDER' was quite a disappointment for me in comparison though, and so was 2015's 'KNIGHT OF CUPS' (on an equal level). 'SONG TO SONG' has all of the same strengths, and flaws, that Malick's last two movies did. They're beautiful to watch, and powerfully acted, and you can tell there's a masterpiece of a film somewhere in there, but the masterpiece was never completed. In any of Malick's recent movies. I hope he finds his way again, soon.Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j_XDrmlMJNY",Song to Song
7,MOscarbradley,"At least the equal of the vastly underrated ""Knight of Cups""",10,21 July 2017,"You know that a Terrence Malick film about the music industry won't be like any other film about the music industry but then a Terrence Malick film won't be like anything other than the Terrence Malick film that preceded it and the one before that and quite possibly the one before that. You could say that Terrence Malick's films are unique..except they aren't; nowadays they all look and sound the same which is why so many people have written him off. I think I may be one of the very few people who not only liked ""Knight of Cups"" but actually chose it as my best film of the year.That was about the movie industry, or at least about an actor in Hollywood, and ""Song to Song"" is about the music industry or at least about a handful of people involved with the music industry and like the last couple of Malick pictures it basically dispenses with dialogue and 'conversations' in favour of a stream of consciousness narration, or several narrations, as various characters take up 'the story'.What story, you may ask? Perhaps unusually for Malick there are more characters than usual on display with at least three stories running through the picture. The central characters are Faye, (Rooney Mara), a would-be performer, Cook, (Michael Fassbender), the Svengali-like producer Faye is sleeping with in the hope that it will advance her career and BV, (Ryan Gosling), another musician with whom she embarks on an affair. Then there's Rhonda, (Natalie Portman), the waitress that Cook marries and Amanda, (Cate Blanchett), the older woman BV falls for, not to mention an extraordinarily good Patti Smith playing herself. Each of these characters has 'a story' to tell and all are beautifully played. In many respects this is Malick's most accessible film since ""The Tree of Life"".Of course, how you respond to it will depend on how you respond to Malick in general. Personally I think this is a vast improvement on ""To the Wonder"" and it's certainly the equal of the vastly underrated ""Knight of Cups"". This is an intelligent and surprisingly engaging film and once again the dazzlingly brilliant cinematography is courtesy of Emmanuel Lubezki. It really shouldn't be missed.",Song to Song
8,Floated2,Disappointing given its cast,4,11 February 2018,"Song to Song appears to be another Terrence Malick film in which is described more as ""art and an experience"" rather than a typical film. Similar to Knight of Cups, containing the same type of elements in its filming, with much close ups of the actors faces, off screen dialogue in narration and scenes of the visuals of the outdoors, or clubs, artwork, Song to Song doesn't offer much of anything different. This film is longer though does offer more characters and doesn't seem as pretentious compared to Knight of Cups. Lead by Rooney Mara, Ryan Gosling and Michael Fassbender, they seem to do a decent job given the description. Though overall, this film becomes quickly boring as not much of anything plot wise occurs. It does feel more like one of those artists/musicians documentaries showcasing artists gatherings and such rather than a feature length film, and we can see as to why this film was panned and movie audiences didn't seem to enjoy it as such. As a film, this was disappointing and perhaps Malick needs a new direction.",Song to Song
9,eddie_baggins,A film that's power grows on you,8,9 October 2017,"will forever be thankful to Terrence Malick for his contributions to cinema.The Texan born filmmaker's influence and inspiration on a generation of movie makers can't be denied, with his wonderful early films Badlands and Days of Heaven true masterpieces of the medium, while his long wait in between films lead to the worthily praised The Thin Red Line, The New World and Tree of Life.Since then however, Malick's non-commitment to a working script and much room for improvisation has led to the almost forgotten about To the Wonder and Knight of Cups, films that for many took things a little too far and for anyone that found those films far too ponderous and unstructured, Song to Song is certainly not a film you should be seeking out.If I was being completely honest, even as true Malick fan that I think myself as, the first 30 minutes of Song to Song was hard to bare.Filled with his trademark visual style (working once more with famed DOP Emmanuel Lubezki), minimal dialogue with voiceovers largely taking its place and a group of characters we get very little backstory on initially, this tale of love and loss in the city of Austin that takes place around the music scene isn't easy to adjust to and Song to Song doesn't do much to win us over but against the odds I all of a sudden found myself swept up in Malick's vision and poetic tale of what it means to truly love someone and find your place in this big bad world.Its arguable Malick's most purely romantic film yet and while To the Wonder and Knight of Cups had their moments, Song to Song feels like the culmination of what Malick's been working on in those films and with this it has allowed Malick to deliver a romantic journey like none-other that's power grows as we continue to understand more about our A-List cast.Filmed way back in 2012, Malick has assembled quite the cast here that's driven by Rooney Mara's lost soul Faye and Ryan Gosling's life loving musician BV as the two fall in love despite the interference of Michael Fassbender's sleazy businessman Cook and his tormented wife Rhonda played by Natalie Portman.All actors acquit themselves well to proceedings and while not every bit of improvised dialogue or character action rings true, there is certainly a merit in allowing actors to inhabit characters without the usual instruction, instead letting them find the heart and soul of their character in a non-formal way.Song to Song is also as visually captivating as any of Malick's recent films and while it lacks a certain grandeur to other films of his back catalogue, this seemingly personal and intimate journey through life will please any of those looking for another slice of Malick visual magic.Final Say – Supposedly the last film of this ilk from Malick, who is returning to more structured filmmaking with his upcoming World War 2 film Radegund, Song to Song is not a film to be enjoyed by a mass audience or for those that have never taken to Malick's works before or in particular those that have found a dislike for his recent output but this examination of love in a life that isn't always easy is a film that will draw you in and take you away on a cinematic journey that only Malick can deliver.4 chainsaw wielding Iceman's out of 5",Song to Song
10,howard.schumann,Examines our disconnection from the sacred,9,20 April 2017,"Observing, feeling, thinking, day dreaming, or simply throwing up your hands in exasperation. You may be engaged in all or none of the above when watching Terence Malick's (""Knight of Cups"") Song to Song, a dreamlike exploration of love and betrayal. Whatever does come up for you, however, and whether or not you have any idea where the film is going, the ride is never less than fascinating. Malick's films will never be to everyone's liking, yet like other directors whose work shattered boundaries and were not fully appreciated until after their death, the totality of his work may take time to fully assess.Similar to Malick's recent films ""To the Wonder"" and ""Knight of Cups,"" Song to Song is a film of mood, memories, and impressions that examines our disconnection from the sacred in our quest for sex, power, and money. Set in Malick's old stomping grounds of Austin, Texas, the film opens as budding musicians, singer Faye (Rooney Mara, ""Lion"") and songwriter BV (Ryan Gosling, ""La La Land"") meet at a party thrown by high-living record producer Cook (Michael Fassbender, ""The Light Between Oceans""), a man of considerable power in the industry who they look to for a foothold.Faye and BV begin a relationship that is playfully erotic, and, in typical Malickian fashion, replete with voice-overs, whispering, introspection, and philosophizing. ""I was desperate to feel something real. I wanted to be free the way he was,"" Faye says and ""Any experience was better than no experience,"" a dubious proposition at best. BV teases her with such pronouncements as ""Just tell me a complete lie. You can say anything you want to me. That's the fun about me."" Seeking something ""real,"" she shows houses for a living - suburban homes and high rise apartments in Austin that become the background set for her romantic trysts.Since Faye admits that she feels nothing and is open to various kinds of pleasures, she becomes involved with both BV and Cook, (a reality that takes BV a long time to discover) as well as taking part, albeit halfheartedly, in a Lesbian affair with French artist Zoey (Bérénice Marlohe, ""Skyfall""). When he learns about Faye's ""betrayal"", he fends off his ex-wife Lykke's (Lykke Li) overtures and hooks up with the older Amanda (Cate Blanchett), who may remind him of his overbearing mother Judy (Linda Emond, ""Indignation"").Cook meets and eventually marries Rhonda (Natalie Portman, ""Jackie"") a waitress in a local coffee shop, but it doesn't turn out well as Cook turns to prostitutes to maintain his freedom from the captivity of marriage. The film meanders from theme to theme and song to song in which Malick embraces the music scene in Austin in an eclectic soundtrack. Featured are the music of Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Bob Dylan and Bob Marley as well as classical composers Maurice Ravel, Gustav Mahler, and Arvo Part. While the characters realize that their lives have been inauthentic, there is still little joy.Malick depicts relationships in terms of fleeting moments that constantly move in and out of our consciousness, never quite tangible enough to grasp or provide satisfaction. Continually seeking their heart's desire, the characters only slowly realize the emptiness of the promise. Underneath their search for connection, there is a spiritual longing that can be sensed but not understood. One character says that something is out there that is trying to find us, but the ""something"" remains obscure. While passion does exist in Malick's visions of nature captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Birdman""), and the film exudes grace in the Leonardo drawing of the Virgin Mary and the painting of the Madonna on a building wall, Song to Song brings us close to the edges of spirituality without fully trusting us to come to grips with something larger than ourselves.",Song to Song
11,paul-allaer,Pretentious crap seems mostly improvised,3,25 March 2017,"""Song to Song"" (2017 release; 129 min.) brings the story of Faye. As the movie opens, we hear Faye announce in voice over ""I went through a period where sex had to be violent"", and with that we are off. Fay seems to have a relationship with both BV (a budding musician) and Cook (a record executive). We see them at various Austin landmarks and outdoor shows (ACL Music Festival, I assume). At this point we are about 10-15 min. into the movie, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-director Terrence Malick, Here he follows a path that s very similar of his previous film ""Knight of Cups"": essentially an abstract film about relationships, with not much dialogue but plenty of voice-over thoughts (""Any experience is better than no experience"" and ""I went along like someone in a dream"", just to give you a glimpse). This movie was actually shot in 2011-12, and is only now seeing the light of day. Rumor has it that Malick had 8 hours of film which he had to cut down to this final version, just over 2 hrs., and when you are watching it, it does feel like we skip from scene to scene without any sense or purpose. As for the lead actors (Rooney Mara as Faye, Ryan Gosling as BV, Michael Fassbender as Cook; Natalie Portman appears about a half hour into the movie for some scenes; yet later Cate Blanchett, as a fling of BV, makes her entrance), it feels like most of what they are doing seems improvised. Not much of it makes sense or is coherent in any way, shape or form. Tons of cameos from the music world (RHCP, Iggy Pop, Patti Smith, Johnny Lydon, etc., mostly in a blink and you'll miss it moment). As a long-time fan and admirer of Terrence Malick, it pains me to tell you that, on the heels of the so-so Knight of Cups, this is even worse. Given the all-star ensemble cast, what a colossal waste of talent all around! ""Song to Song"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and given who all was involved in this production, I couldn't wait to see it. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. ""Song to Song"" is not a movie that I can recommend to anyone, although there may be some curiosity about this film, given the all-star cast attached to it. Viewer beware! (*UPDATE* The movie sank like a stone at the box office, and disappeared after just one week from the theater here in Cincinnati.)",Song to Song

13,davidmvining,Remarkable,10,28 October 2020,"In terms of this experimental period of Malick's career, defined by the current era settings, extremely loose productions without scripts, and extended filming schedules, Song to Song is the best of the three. It is more emotionally involving than Knight of Cups and more complete than To the Wonder. I remember this showing up on Amazon Prime a couple of years ago. I was excited because I hadn't seen it yet and apprehensive because Malick's reputation had suffered. I was ready to be disappointed, finally, in a Malick film. And yet, I still got swept away with the story and the characters wondering, once again, what critics seemed to be missing.It's the story of a handful of people in Austin, Texas, centered around the music scene there. Cook, played by Michael Fassbender, is a music producer, a materialist, and a tempter into this world of carefree wealth. DV, played by Ryan Gosling, is a young musical talent just breaking out into the professional world. Faye, played by Rooney Mara, is Cook's former receptionist who also plays music with dreams of going professional herself. Rhonda, played by Natalie Portman, is a former kindergarten teacher and current waitress that Cook picks up and quickly marries. These four characters weave in and out of each other's lives, but the malignant center is Cook.Like all Malick films, there's an Eden like space where the characters are at their happiest, and that comes when Cook, DV, and Faye go to Mexico for a few days. It's here that the Eden motif gains a new interesting twist where Cook essentially ends up filling the role of the serpent in the garden. His presence there takes a while to sow the seeds of mistrust between DV and Faye in their burgeoning relationship, but he's still the direct source. What ends up happening is that they all go their separate ways after a time back in Austin. DV finds out that Cook has been cheating him out of rights to his music. DV digs at Faye's past with Cook, uncovering new layers that he can't get over. Faye feels guilty for continuing her sexual liaisons with Cook while seeing Faye. DV and Faye break up. Cook picks up Rhonda and swiftly brings the humble woman into his expensive and hedonistic lifestyle.They happy trio has been split because of betrayal and corruption. Cook corrupted Faye. Cook betrayed DV. DV allowed his love of Faye to be corrupted by Cook. Cook corrupts Rhonda, though she knows what is happening and it bothers her. The movie isn't really about temptation and corruption though, it's about mercy and forgiveness. These characters need to go through a journey where mercy can come to them and through them. They need to hurt and feel lost, and that's exactly what they go through.The thing about Malick's style is that he's interested in capturing emotional moments that collect together into a thematic whole. That's why his production approach ends up working for him rather than against him. He walks in with a clear idea of what he wants to say, lets improvisation guide his entire process with that goal in mind, and then collects the material together and whittles it down (the first cut of this film was apparently eight hours long). The production of Song to Song allowed for a lot of that intimate time between actors that led to the quiet moments that really make the movie work.My wife watched with me for the first twenty minutes and ended up getting confused and walked out. She was expecting a straight forward and linearly told story. When I explained to her that the individual images on their own aren't that important, that the cutting from one image to the next was more about creating an emotional sense than a literal sense, she simply rejected the storytelling aesthetic completely and gave up. I think that's a challenge for a lot of people going into a Malick film, especially this trio of films, because they lean very heavily into the emotional space rather than the literal space. We've been conditioned to accept a certain type of visual storytelling, and Malick is different from that. It's a completely different vocabulary to get used to, and that's the kind of effort a lot of people don't want to go through when sitting down to take in an entertainment. Personally, though, I've just gotten it since the first time I saw The Thin Red Line. It makes sense to me.The film's resolution was the most emotionally satisfying end to a Malick movie since The Tree of Life. The mercy and forgiveness exhibited by the characters, and the ultimate fall of another, was really touching.Now, a comment about the actors. Ryan Gosling was himself, awkward and good looking so the girls love him. Rooney Mara is a wonderful mix of soulful and energetic, providing the primary bedrock on which the movie operates. Natalie Portman is quiet and sad. However it's Michael Fassbender that really feels just right. He seems more physically active and able to improvise than any of the others, creating a wild card character, appropriately so, that is just interesting to watch. He's probably the single best male actor Malick hired in this ""captured moment"" era.Song to Song is a remarkable film. Tender and sad with wonderful performances and a clear emotional throughline, it's the best Malick movie since The Tree of Life.",Song to Song
14,Sherazade,Visually competent but where's the script?,4,8 December 2017,"Michael Fassbender, Ryan Gosling and Natalie Portman are such seasoned actors that they could convincingly walk around for three hours without any purpose or direction and still sell a story. Rooney Mara on the other hand (try as I may each time to look past the privileged life that gave her a Hollywood career and believe whatever it is she is trying to convey to me) just didn't cut it as the lead actress, she just gave off an aura that she was uncomfortable the whole time which just seemed to confirm that there was indeed no script or that hers was just constantly being revised and shared with no one else but her. When even Cate Blanchett in her blink-and-you'll-miss-her cameo is Oscar-worthy compared to a film's lead actress, there is a problem.",Song to Song
15,JuguAbraham,Unusually vapid work from the master filmmaker,7,27 June 2017,"I am an admirer of Terrence Malick to the extent that I consider him one of the finest filmmakers rubbing shoulders with Andrei Tarkovsky and Stanley Kubrick. He changed the way films were made by throwing the concept of a written script for actors to follow out of the window. He made mother nature a major actor. His earlier films dealt with philosophy, books, religion, science and even arcane pieces of music from faraway lands. 'Song to Song' is a surprising departure from all that. The subject is vapid. Sex and manipulation seem to be the only subjects of discussion, apart from absolutely gorgeous cinematography, which any film of Malick offers.Malick used to pick up pieces of music with care and place it intelligently within a film. In ""Song to song"" he does pick up Kieslowski's famous composer Preisner's music but strangely plays bits of it again and again when the music does not add value to the visual, compared to Malick's very intelligent use of music in his past work. Are the editors to blame? Possibly.Then there is a scene with a caterpillar which will remind cineastes of John Schlesinger's 1967 film ""Far from the madding crowd."" Malick had borrowed ideas from Tarkovsky in the past and now he seems to recall striking visuals of British cinema.More amusing for me was that the main credits forgot to add Cate Blanchet's name while her name is indeed included in the longer list at the end.For me, a Malick admirer, the film was without substance. And why is Malick not using blacks and hispanics in main roles but continually using them in roles that depict them in states of poverty and helplessness? Questions. Questions.",Song to Song
16,bandw,A Bridge too Far for this Malick admirer,5,25 December 2017,"Of the thousands of movies I have seen Malick's ""The Tree of Life"" is 
perhaps at the top of my list. It grabbed me and never let up. I have
seen most of Malick's movies and beginning with ""The Tree of Life"" 
he developed a
unique style that he has worked with in his succeeding movies, pushing
it further with each. I liked ""To the Wonder"" and was still on board
with ""Knight of Cups,"" although neither was nowhere near the masterpiece
that ""Tree"" was. But with ""Song to Song"" Malick has pushed the limits of
his style beyond where I can appreciate it--I am hoping that this will
be the last of this experimental film making in this vein.As usual, the images are captivating. It looks like Malick must drive
around and, as soon as he sees something that interests him, he films it
(with his consummate talent and taste) and then tries to merge all of
the images into some narrative that makes some sense, mainly to him
I'm afraid. The trademark closely miked audio, long takes of characters
walking around each other, minimal dialog, beautiful people, and
nature shots are in evidence. Music is essential to any Malick movie I have seen and it is puzzling
why the music in this movie, that is played against the backdrop of the 
Austin music scene, did not engage me. Interspersed among the Austin
scene are classical segments--Saint-Seans seems a favorite here.
The supporting score is highly fragmented, which I suppose is in
keeping with the fragmented nature of the story line, but just when
I was appreciating a song there was a cut to an unrelated scene.There are many well known musicians in the cast, playing themselves,
such as Iggy Pop, Lykke Li, Sara Quin, Chad Smith. Patti Smith does
get some time, both as a character in the story and as a singer.If there is a coherent story, I missed it. I got the basic love
triangle bit, but from there all was obscure. How Cate Blanchett figured
into things was a total mystery to me. Was she there simply as a
box office draw? The main character, played by Ryan Gosling, is 
given the name ""RV"" and I got that only from the closing credits. When
I realized that I had entirely missed the boat on the characters was
when I saw in the credits two actors listed as being BV's brother. 
Nowhere did I catch that BV had a brother.If I were to have turned off trying to make sense of this thing and just
sat back an enjoyed the images, there would have been enough here to think
this is worthwhile. But, unless you are plugged into Malick's recent
vision, you might give this a miss.",Song to Song
17,rockman182,Song to Song (2017),9,18 March 2017,"What a cinematic experience. If you know me well, you know I love Terrence Malick's work. It wasn't always that way, I had to revisit some of his work to really appreciate what he brings to cinema. Song to Song may have been the film I was most hyped for in 2017, seeing as my favorite actor and actress (Ryan Gosling and Rooney Mara) were finally working together and teaming up with a visionary like Malick. I know this film will divide and polarize viewers but I think if you love cinema and Malick's style (especially his last few films) you will enjoy this work.The film is mostly about a couple of musicians who fall for each other and their captivating connection. Betrayal, infidelity, and other humanly circumstances get in the way of their relationship but then they eventually drift apart and find their way to each other. First off, this film has an excellent cast. The four of the top billed cast are immensely talented and this film has a number of satisfying musical cameos. Just like with Tree of Life and Knight of Cups the film uses camera-work that is shifty, montage-like, personal, and with quick cuts. There is use of fish-eye lens, first person, behind the head shots, you name it. The cinematography at times is absolutely gorgeous; the film is as close to visual art as you can get. And this is no surprise because its quintessential Malick.Narrative structure of the film is coherent despite the cutting and style of storytelling. Its not at ll hard to follow and I was engaged from the get go, it comes down to personal taste. I can imagine a casual moviegoer to get frustrated with the structure and lack of straightforward progression. I found the intricacies of the interactions between the characters so fascinating and thought there was real compatibility between the cast members. I love Rooney Mara so much and her beauty was so crisp in every scene she was in. The characters in this film experience a range of human emotions throughout and its a wonder to behold.Many may find the film to be pretentious in its attempt to be profound. I was perfectly fine with the inner monologues of the characters, much like with Malick's recent films. I still think Tree of Life is his best masterpiece but this film is probably the next of his filmography that I feel a strong connection with. I am glad I experienced this film as soon as possible and wish it would get the Criterion treatment much like some of Malick's other work.9/10",Song to Song

20,Alexander_Blanchett,Someone gives Terrence Malick a typewriter,5,27 June 2017,"so he can finally write screenplays. Well I am getting tired of this Malick gimmick. I mean it literally is him and best pal Emanuel Lubezki as well as a couple of pretty people taking a cam and making beautiful shots. Putting them together and trying to make sense out of it. Well yes, that worked with The Tree of Life but only because that flick really did make sense and had something to say. This one was a missed opportunity. They could have made so much more out of the material of shots of the Austin music festival but instead he chose to tell exactly the same ""story"" like with his previous two films. Why I still give the film a rather ""high"" rating is that I cannot doubt the beautifulness of it. The way it is shot is once again tremendous thanks to Lubezki. The choice of music perfect to create the right mood and atmosphere. The acting was solid enough. While Michael Fassbender was channeling Christian Bale in ""Knight of Cups"" I really liked Ryan Golsing and especially Rooney Mara who could tell so much without any words. Nice short appearances by Cate Blanchett who I don't remember having any dialogue (what a waste) but also made the performance through her expressions. Strong moments by Holly Hunter as well and a fun cameo by Val Kilmer. Still , I am glad that Malick will be back with a more narrative film with his next feature.",Song to Song

It is a creative, somewhat rambling, meditative study of the yearning for love by people who are somewhat broken emotionally, and relatively in capable of engaging in a healthy relationship. The performances were outstanding, the cast was amazing. And this is a rewarding film to watch if you have the patience.

23,WhimsicalVonia,A Beautiful Ode to Amazing Austin & A Charming Experience to Watch,7,4 October 2017,"This certainly is not for everyone. There is no linear plot really, and it can be best described as a mesh of images, feelings, emotions, montages, vignettes. I would I have been a Terrence Malick admirer for many years now. This might not be his best, but it also is not as bad as many critics are saying. It does borrow from his other films- themes, ideas, etcetera. Thirty seconds, anywhere during the film, is enough to know this is obviously the work of Malick. Interestingly, most of the things many critics are citing as problems are the precise reasons why I liked it. I do feel it was a little long and there is some validity to the problems mentioned (it could have done with a few less random characters), but overall this was a wonderful film to experience. * Having little plot and creative camera angles, sudden cuts and minimal segues was all necessary to create a feeling. I do not pretend how to properly describe the technical terms here, but all I can say Malick & Lubezki know what they are doing. They had a vision and they carried it out. I, for one, appreciate the results. The New York Times: ""The cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki creates plunging, whirling, beatifically graceful, seemingly borderless images that gather light lovingly and avidly—and catch the light with which each of the film's actors seems to glow."" This is a feeling film. Watching it is an experience, comparable to visiting an art museum. * The voiceovers actually added to the overall effect of the film, dreamlike and practically mesmerizing. * So what is this about? It is about life. About love. About relationships, about people. About how we sometimes know what we want, but mostly do not. How we strive to be more, but often fail. How life can bring us down, how love can often disappoint; but, likewise, how life can amaze, surprise, and be maybe not everything we wanted but something we can learn to embrace with vivacity. About entanglements- between boyfriends and girlfriends; amongst mother and daughter, mother and son, father and daughter, father and son; within families; with friends; and- most importantly- with ourselves. * This is a music film. Several celebrity musicians have cameos. The score is nice when it is subtle and at turns beautiful and magnificent when it is not. * The cast is phenomenal. Ryan Gosling, Rooney Mara, Michael Fassbender, Natalie Portman, Cate Blanchett, Bérénice Marlohe. This last French actress is stunning and I am quickly becoming a big fan of hers. I look forward to seeing more from her. So far, my favorite from her is not the more popular Skyfall or Twin Peaks, but as the leading actress in 5 to 7. * Filming locations I totally recognized and have been to, even frequent: Austin City Hall (the building that is shaped like an armadillo!), Enoteca Vespaio, Hotel San Jose, Hotel Cecelia, Cenote, The Mohawk, Hangar Lounge, Second Bar & Kitchen, Asti Trattoria, Caesar Chavez Street mural, Hula Hut, Ms. P's Electric Cock, Rainey Street, South Congress Street (Home Slice, Stag), Caffé Medici, Stubb's, Perla's, under the Brontosaurus Bridge, Pennypacker Bridge, Zilker Park, Hangar Lounge (The Rooftop especially), Rain (along with other gay clubs downtown), ElevenEleven, Mozart's, Lake Travis, Ann Richards Bridge, Mexican American Cultural Center, University of Texas Football Stadium, University of Texas Tower (where the infamous shooter was in 1966, resulting in the unfortunate 18 deaths), The Marchesa Hall & Theater (outside), Downtown Austin skyline (Especially at night, my favorite skyscraper, the Friday Bank Tower). This was obviously filmed during SXSW. Possibly also Fun Fun Fun Fest. An ode to the amazing city of Austin, which I visit at least twice a month (I am not far).

He could be classified as artisty but I don't see it like that and I don't think he does either. He's just doing what he thinks is right. Because the difference between him and so many other directors is that he is genuine.And for whatever reason I absolutely love it. So many people don't which I understand. These movies aren't easy to watch. You have to put a lot in and pay attention to the subtleties. You have to give 100% of your attention or you won't be in tune to what's happening. I hate to say that you have to really really love movies to like him but I think you do. If you have seen so many movies and are familiar with every technique and story telling device and kinda get sick of it then Terrence Malick is refreshing.I think his avant-garde movies get so much more attention than other nonconventional movies because he uses such an A list cast. They're of course great. I'll watch a movie of his with my wife and she has no idea what was going on or what happened and I was following along the whole time. I don't know what it is. Some people speak the language and some don't. Now for the record I don't think people who don't are stupid or ""just don't get art"" or something pretentious like that. Just some like it and some don't. Like Tom Waits.The movie plays out like a montage basically. There's very little dialogue and most of the lines are in narration. From multiple characters. What they say paired up with the shot, either contrasted or not tells you the story. As well as what they say then the next shot can determine if they're telling the truth or lying. Or juxtaposes what they're thinking. Kids are a common theme in this movie. Because they represent the next step of a relationship: family. And the two girls in this aren't young, they must be thinking about this.The movie has a satisfying ending. Even if the ending catches you by surprise. You think about it for a second and go ""oh yeah, okay."" It's not a kill the bad guy climax.The story is very good and about a girl trying to find her way in life. She has made mistakes and thinks that this defines who she is when infact she can learn and move on. I think most women go through her struggle of learning to stop going for the bad boy and go for the nice guy/guy that's right for them.The movie is a little long. Just a little.

27,tapio_hietamaki,An engaging examination of the spiritual turmoil of wealthy music professionals: a movie that captures the beauty of fleeting moments as well as any Terrence Malick production,8,2 May 2017,"People are saying that Terrence Malick is losing touch, a great auteur is going down and he's run out of things to say. Of course there are also those who don't see anything worthwhile in any of Malick's work and don't understand the praise he's getting from film critics, citing his films as an example of pretentiousness.Personally I thought 'Song to Song' was actually an improvement over 'To the Wonder', probably because the latter dealt with issues of marriage and living abroad, themes that didn't resonate with my experiences like the themes of 'Song to Song' did. Malick's films are very consistent, he has his signature style that he utilizes to great effect in all of his films and putting one over the other is really just personal preference. The universe-embracing end-all, be-all epic 'The Tree of Life' is a turn-off for people looking for something subdued and intimate, while the quiet contemplation of 'Days of Heaven' will seem boring to some.'Song to Song' examines the modern musical business, the life of successful music producers, musicians and the people who are drawn to that success, wealth and power. The movie has footage from real live shows and many stars like Iggy Pop and Patti Smith appear as themselves, engaging in intimate discussions with the characters of the movie.The theme of the movie is Christian, like with all of Malick's films. He takes a look at the spiritual turmoil residing in the modern man, looking for an inner peace and trying to achieve something worthwhile, never finding it due to the absence of God. These religious themes are not as overt as in some of his movies, so it's still a good watch for people who aren't religious.",Song to Song
28,wavecat13,Beautiful to behold but...,7,30 August 2018,"You can say so much about Malick's stunning, unique visual style. His camera is always moving and never lingers long. There is a mix of lenses - wide angles, fish eyes, and everything is fluid. And frequently beautiful - all of his films feature many ravishing images. This is done in the same style as Knight of Cups and Tree of Life, with characters sharing their inner thoughts in voice-over as events dreamily unfold. And that is great, but that is not the same as having a coherent narrative and clear themes. Much of this takes place in the world of pop music, with cameos from Patti Smith and Johnny Rotten and others, but there is little music making going on here. The story revolves around a love triangle featuring 2 musicians, arrogant Cook (a big star?) and nice guy BV, and the girl they both get involved with. She also gets into a brief lesbian relationship (why?), and Cook beds down a sexy waitress. There is a lot of physicality, with the characters constantly caressing and playing with each other. The star power is here and the acting is fine, but the story falls short, despite the true-love-wins-in-the-end finale. I have to add Malick to my long list of directors whose writing ability is not on a par with their visual brilliance.",Song to Song
29,diand_,Lightness and weight,8,15 March 2017,"In philosophy both Parmenides and Heraclitus saw lightness as the positive side of the lightness-weight dichotomy. Later, the writer Italo Calvino took the same position. But it was Milan Kundera who stated it as a dilemma framed in Nietzsche's concept of the eternal return: a heavy burden can crush us, but the heavier the burden, the more real and truthful our lives become. Malick clearly takes on the latter position in this movie, which was originally more aptly titled Weightless. This theme is also connected to Heidegger's Man being called back in self-awareness and fulfillment by answering introspective questions about his existence.Song to song is an exploration of love and ambition set against the Austin music scene. Especially around the theme of love the movie makes interesting observations: That true love is only possible by isolating yourself from the fake world (of music and money here), that walls are built around you inhibiting you from finding real love. Another observation is that early in life you love everyone, but ultimately your awareness, society, and religion lets you end up with one true love, unable to love others any more.The notion Malick makes about love is the romantic character of love itself, romantic not in the sense we nowadays attach to it, but the original meaning as an unattainable ideal, combined with adoration of nature and emphasis on the individual and its intense emotions, the latter creating beauty and experience. Romanticism was mainly a reaction to industrialization and urban sprawl: All Malick movies have shots of urban landscapes and nature scenes; they look for beauty in that nature and have a preference for searching for intuition instead of filming fixed storyboards.The story however develops in a non-romantic direction: Where in the quintessential novel of the romantic (or more precisely Sturm und Drang) movement the main male character shoots himself after being rejected by the woman he loves (Goethe's Die Leiden des jungen Werthers), Malick replaces that hopelessness with a man who commits adultery, has regrets and is punished and tested by the woman he loves who commits far more and extremer adulterous acts.Malick uses again a naturalistic style of filming, adding unscripted moments that occur during the movie shoot. Some footage is shot at the Austin City Limits festival and short interviews with John Lydon and Iggy Pop are included. The state of Texas features prominently: a key scene is before a Texaco gas station for example, but overall it is the unusual, non-clichéd beauty of both nature and the built-up Texan landscape that is well captured by Lubezki's camera, making effective use of wide camera angles. It also feels less slow and has more snappy cuts than Knight of Cups, which will be a relief for many I guess. The editing by a team of 8 (!) editors is however inconsistent and one of the weaknesses of the movie.Two actresses in the movie have in my opinion the capability to give this an extra level, to give it real character depth acting on multiple levels in order to convey the emotions Malick's movies are oddly enough often lacking despite aiming for them: Portman and Blanchett. They are so underused and reduced to cardboard characters that it can almost be called a shame.What struck me also about this movie is how conservative and deeply religious Malick's world view is: He clearly roots for Patti Smith's love story she tells in the movie for example, and sees the other musicians and portrays them as lost souls. In Song to song the woman repents, but the man only regrets. I see a parallel here with Tarkovsky's movies, which show the same religious, conservative world view. It brings up an odd observation: These two movie geniuses shatter the notion that true art can nowadays only be made by free souls, their art more in line with church-supported art like it used to be (Note: See The Tree of Life explanation by Bishop Barron).Von Trier once remarked that he in effect makes the same movie over and over again, and Malick has come to that same point now. He has perfected his storytelling skills, hides the movie in the images and by editing, uses time and space shifting, sees salvation in nature (the element of water is effectively used here), adds autobiographical elements (music, adultery, suicide, father-son relation, ambition), so Radegund can hopefully be the creative destruction many now hope for.",Song to Song
30,barbagvido,"Malick, what can I say?",7,15 September 2017,"Song to Song is the latest release by the director Terrence Malick and that alone speaks for itself. I really don't know how to describe this. Just like every Malick movie, it's a unique experience. It's a snooze-fest, but there is something about it.It barely feels like a movie, it's actually a bit of a dream-like experience. None of those scenes is actually complete. It's all kinda weirdly cut together and sometimes you have to think about what just happened. It has an ambiguity of a poem. The way it's edited, I'd describe it like this. Imagine if someone made a movie out of all the parts that were supposed to be unused. So, from longer scenes, which were supposed to have conversations, we have just these shots of faces with some random lines, but never the full conversation. I don't know how else can I put that. It's strange, it's kinda boring, but it's also kinda beautiful at the same time. You just need to let yourself get lost in Malick's beautiful shots and let your mind fly away.Still, as beautiful as it is, I don't feel the purpose of this movie. The whole experience feels a bit pointless and unearned. The plot is almost non-existent, but the only way I can explain it is that it's some kind of a sub-conscious examination of relationships and love. Still, not everyone's cup of tea, that's for sure.",Song to Song
31,paulijcalderon,Floating around with music,7,12 July 2017,"When I saw ""Knight of Cups"" last year I had no idea what to make of it. As time passed I couldn't really get the film out of my mind and it grew on me quite a lot. I find myself liking Terrence Malick's work more with each new film I see from him. I will admit that I underestimated him at first, but now I'm starting to really enjoy his dreamlike style. The camera floats around the characters and it's all so easy to watch as it flows by. It's about existentialism. Characters wandering through environments, talking to other people and re-living past memories. That's what makes these Malick films worthwhile. By just emptying your mind for a couple of hours and experiencing different emotions. At first I was bugged by the voice-overs. To me they felt unnecessarily cryptic and way too preachy. I liked it so much more when the people in the films had real conversations with each other. However, here in ""Song to Song"", the voice-over does elevate what's on screen. It made me understand what was going on in the minds of our characters. They talk to you like you are someone they trust. Besides, the dialogue felt natural and not overly poetic. The film is still poetic in its tone which works nicely.It's pleasant to look at. I love the different places chosen for the film. Something about them make me feel calm. This is a movie that I would recommend to people who feel stressed because it will relax you and make you remember good emotions. It's not really for casual viewing or for those who wanna follow an engaging plot. Malick uses a nonlinear narrative that doesn't rely on making sense. So, it's not for everyone. I prefer ""Knight of Cups"" just a little bit more than this one, but it comes close to being as nice to watch.",Song to Song
32,mbhgkmsgg,Two hours of nothing,2,23 November 2020,"I'll be the first to admit that clearly, I didn't get it. Although to be completely honest, I'm not sure that there was anything to get. Song to Song is an incredibly simple story wrapped into an incredibly complicated and meaningless shell.This was my first time watching a Malick film, so maybe it is true that I just didn't get it. But the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that there is nothing to get. It's a film filled with shots of nothing. Shots that linger for far too long revealing nothing that wasn't already revealed. Shots that are supposedly filled with meaning but come off as nothing but pretentious. And it's these shots that make the movie so incredibly slow. So slow, in fact, that I ended up checking twice how much was still left.But it's not just the lack of substance that I found troubling. It's also the fact that this is such a simple story that is being told in an unnecessarily complicated way. It's a story of lovers who get mixed up in various relationships only to realise with whom they really belong. It's a story that's been told endless times in endless ways. Somehow, though, Song to Song manages to take that story and turn it into what I can only describe as a bunch of nothing. I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story, nor did I care about anything else. I didn't even care about Ryan Gosling, who I would consider to be my favourite actor.In a way, I have to give credit to Malick for creating something as meaningless as this. To be able to make a two-hour movie filled with a whole bunch of nothing is remarkable in and of its self. But, as I said, maybe I just didn't get it. Maybe this really is the masterpiece that so many people consider it to be. But luckily we don't all have to like the same things, because I sincerely hope that I never have to watch Song to Song again.",Song to Song

I am a fan of Malick and his poetic style but this movie only has poetry and no plot. I understand he'll never be a director that focuses on story but a lot of his movies convey their message somewhat clearly like the brilliant Days of Heaven or his recent A Hidden Life. Song to Song certainly has moments that capture life and nature like only Malick can but ultimately the movie just meanders for over 2 hours. There must be so much interesting footage on the cutting room floor that could be assembled into a very good movie. Oh well, Malick does what he does and he's not going to change.

Why not use the same beautiful cinematography on an opposite subject...poor folks struggling in life and the environment they are caught in.

After his 21st century peak in The Tree of Life everything that followed are just residues of that success. Here we've got another set of characters that are lost and longing, but they aren't as interesting as in his previous works - that's the law of diminishing returns. They're just beautiful people filmed in beautiful places murmuring words we've already heard before in a superior Malick film and it is too thematically identical to Knight of Cups.It stars Ryan Gosling who does Gosling things, Michael Fassbender playing like a lesser version of his character in Shame, and other big names like Natalie Portman, Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett. It also featured Patti Smith playing herself and opening up about her real life, but she chose the wrong Malick film.This is a perfect example of self-parody.

But as a film critic, you have to sit there and endure each torturous frame. Terrence Malick's arrogance definitely comes across in this film.

51,alex-klein2424,Song of the Year,9,13 June 2017,"If you would have asked me five years ago who my favorite director was, I would have told you whoever makes the Marvel movies. Today I am proud to say that I have stepped out of the cave and over the last two years have submersed myself in cinema in all of its forms. Because of that, I could now tell you who my top five favorite directors are and why and one of the top people is Terrence Malick. Everything about him is magic and Song to Song is no different.Song to Song, like most Malick movies, doesn't really have a plot. It is a movie about two different love triangles set to the Austin, TX music scene. That is about as much as you will get from the movie but that is the point. A Malick movie does not need a plot. Each film is a display of art and a cruise through cinematography. Malick is also famous for casting a bunch of famous people and then cutting some or all of their footage at the last minute. He is also famous for taking forever to make his movies. This movie was worked on for a long time and stars Ryan Gosling, Rooney Mara, Michael Fassbender, and Natalie Portman. It also was originally billed with Christian Bale but all of his scenes were cut. With that said, all of the above actors (minus Bale) were phenomenal. They take you through a journey of love and loss, death and life, and their interests criss cross each other throughout the film. As little a plot as their is in these films, I was able to follow this one the best.The cinematography, as stated earlier, is top of the art. Malick always uses Emmanuel Lubezki who you may know as the man who did the cinematography for Birdman and The Revenant. He has an ethereal flow and a great eye for wide shots and tracking shots and utilizes both of those to brilliant effect in Song to Song. There was also a great soundtrack throughout the film that had no rhyme or reason and most of the songs were completely different from one another but they are meant to evoke emotions inside of both the characters as they are going through current events, and the viewer.The message of this movie is that a song can evoke a memory or emotion from a past time, but you may not know that seeing the film. It is tough to grasp but that is what makes Malick's movies so brilliant. It is like staring at a moving painting for two hours and trying to discern what it is about. Two people may have very different ideas of what is going on and that is why many of Malick's movies are either hated or loved. Go see Song to Song if you love art and cinema. Go see it if you are a Malick fan or a Lubezki fan. Don't see this movie if you need to have a plot in your film. The usher at the beginning of the movie told the crowd that many people walk out of his movies because of that and I would hate for you to be one of those people. But if you want to experience a truly immersive art piece, hurry and find this movie near you.",Song to Song
52,stefanopertile,An astonishingly beautiful meditation about human feelings and relationships in the Malick's way,9,4 June 2019,"IMHO there are two main kinds of films: the ones that empty your mind with action and plot, and those which take a form of meditation and let feelings and thinking arise.
Of course this film is in the latter.
Song to song is coincidentally set in the music business as a meditation about feelings, love, power, sex, beauty and family.
The pace, as usual in Malick, is slow; the grace and the beauty of images and characters is everywhere.
Surprised by the presence of rockstar Patti Smith amid others, who acts as a mentor.

53,williammjeffery,Far from terrible but still a let down by Malick,5,1 July 2017,"Another hypnotic, philosophical film by Terrence Malick, this time about two love triangles that intersect in the music scene in Austin, Texas. With a run time that's far too long for the material used, Malick's notorious use of moments instead of scenes, through a kinetic, fish eye lens and sedative whispering, find meaning even if you're searching constantly for story. It's all a bit of a dream how the movie cuts from one moment to the next without establishment. Some scenes were nothing more than looking like expensive perfume commercials. Malick's style becomes deceptive as he recycles vivid visual techniques for a story that really is quite a drag. I found myself a bit bored to be honest but admired how the framework of Malick's mind translated on the screen.",Song to Song

55,Bluegull99,Not even...,1,9 June 2020,"... Gosling can safe this one. I am all in for experimental, special movies, but sorry, this here, is just tosh. And no, I won't say it in nicer words, it is hedonistic nonsense.
It looks like someone with an extremely shaky hand fulfilled their plan to film some rather bad acting class students who have gotten the instruction to 'try and look artistic, alternative and be just as artsy as they can get'.
It was almost fascinating seeing actually brilliant actors like Cate Blanchett making fools of themselves, every scene looking so forced and awkward it was hard not to look away. Same goes for Natalie Portman, she is probably as credible as the poor rednecky pink dressed, boobed out waitress as Queen Elizabeth II would be as a prostitute.
Ryan Gosling normally is a guarantee to find a great movie, even if you dislike the movie (for me 'Blue Valentine' - I really disliked the movie itself for its depressimg mood but I have to give it that it still was a brilliant movie with brilliant acting). Here, no, here I have a camera experiment and quite good actors making fools of themselves all in the name of 'art'.Another interesting thing for me is Michael Fassbender. He has the strangest effect on me. He is visually a beautiful man, he really is for my taste. And he also is a good actor, but I have seen four movies with him in it, and they all had the same freezer cold effect when it comes to the movies itself and also his characters. I had this with 'Shame' (it was like watching frozen linoleum, and it goes for every charater in the movie. Even the otherwise lovely and talented Carey Mulligan seems just like another Borg). Same goes for 'MacBeth, visually beautiful, stunning even, but, again the same effect of Fassbender and the otherwise lovely Marion Cotillard)And the same here now, only that 'Song to Song' is completley missing any kind of plot, it's just gibberish on camera. I found myself thinking of Kindergarden, when back then, to relax us kids we had those free 10 minutes, where the teacher said things like 'and now everyone can run around in circles, and make strange faces, and laugh out loud and jump etc.' This movie pretty much looked like this memory to me.

Not just the story went slow and confusing but even the actors talked slowly like we had the time of the world, another thing it's the way they kept repiting the same type of scenes, we got an incredible amount of almost sex- very touchy-romantic scenes between the characters.

Everyone can quote the ""visuals"" as much as they want but it's not even about the non-story of the movie and the little flashes of these ultimate ""superior"" lives thrown upon us mortals. it's the total uselessness of these characters (ah, if only they were Swedish... maybe Bergman would have known what to do with them, but they are Americans and they are Hollywood and they are as empty as Hollywood can be). We get to see these people's wealthy abodes and who lives like that really? Inside never lived before empty houses, no furniture, no nothing, just always everything so sterile, same as the minds of the famous actors that like cameos or clichés appear on the screen just to portray the inutility of their wanton lives.

Any Calvin Klein ""Obsession"" advert from the 80s had more substance, a more compelling story line and infinitely more ability to hold my interest. This was like a cinematic Austin Architectural Digest showcase of homes, but less interesting. Oh. It was about ""struggling musicians""? Malick's definition of ""struggling"" is as far from reality as Gigli is from good.The Patti Smith cameo and song snippets in a soundtrack (seemingly created by 20 or 30 misguided people who did not know each other and apparently had not seen the film) were my sole high points.

Mara's character, first finding herself in an unhappy relationship with Michael Fassbender. It is not long before she falls deeply in love with Ryan Gosling, thus sparking the chain of events that are to be set into order.It is not soon before our two protagonists find fault with each other, inevitably drifting apart. Along the way, Fassbender meets Natalie Portman's character as she is working as a waiter in a small town diner. Portman succumbs to Fassbenders charm and the two begin a relationship. However, this leads to an unhealthy relationship that forces Portman's character to commit a senseless act.Through there many relationships Gosling and Mara seem to long for each other and cannot find the proper substitution to ease the heartbreak they have experienced. It was not soon after before the two met at a party. They decide to set their differences aside and love each other for who they truly are, broken and flawed.Song to Song is a fantastic movie for many reasons.

71,mattspach,Self-indulgent Pointless Garbage,1,13 July 2017,"There is absolutely no reason any human being would want to waste their time watching this plot-less, character-less, emotion-less piece of absolute garbage. In the midst of laughing hysterically at what is intended to be a dramatic and thought-provoking piece of 'cinematic art' I kept telling myself ""This has to be the worst film ever made"". I have a great deal of respect for most of the artists involved in the making of this film including Malick, who has made some absolutely amazing, groundbreaking movies in his career. On top of that I can't stand the formulaic and overplayed Hollywood movies that keep flying off the shelves, which is why I go out of my way to watch films like this.Similar to the two previous projects of Terrence Malick (To the Wonder and Knight of Cups), we are introduced vaguely into a small window in the lives of a few individuals without being given any character development of narrative base. Without a basic understanding of who are characters are and what they like about each other or what their personalities are like we cannot even force ourselves to have the smallest bit invested in the story. Not only is the acting impossible to take seriously, the directing is ten times as bad. We are constantly unsure who's story is being told and the role that each character plays on the lives of the others. This is a star-studded cast of trained actors, but they are thrust into this overbearingly indulgent sphere of artsy fartsy cinematography and false profundity being delivered through emotionless voice-over. Ryan Gosling has by far the best performance, and can almost be believed to be a real person once or twice. Yet we cannot be sure what's happened to him or what his desires, intentions, or beliefs are. The other performances are all absolute garbage but maybe has to do with the editing, which removed almost every scene with any dialogue. If you went through this movie, amongst the touching of walls and occasional touching of shoulders and stomachs, I don't think you could find a single cohesive scene where the goals or relationships of the characters could be defined or even interpreted without making huge assumptions. The Texas music scene was a complete gimmick and had absolutely nothing to do with the storyline or characters in any way. It was just used as a way to create some rhythm to the editing of what would have otherwise been a film entirely devoted to absurd prancing around, birdlike mating rituals, touching each other sensually, and then having a glow-stick party just to transition smoothly to another pointless, indulgent scene that doesn't develop anything new. So the ""music scene setting"" was an excuse to get a few famous musicians to film in your movie, and a way to explain the background of a film without a background.The fact that this was shot in 2012, and not screened until 2017, gives me a pretty clear idea of how much garbage they originally shot. But it also raises the question as to why these specific shots and 'scenes' were chosen for the final cut. I feel terribly bad for Rooney Mara, who may have had a few good performances in there somewhere, but must have been cut somewhere along the way. For the first half of the films she doesn't say a single word on screen but seems to be the main character. In the end we don't feel sorry, we don't forgive, we're not proud of her, we basically don't give two shits what happens to any of them. And we aren't told what happens to any of them or given even the slightest glimpse of a conclusion. As someone who loves unanswered questions as a natural part of storytelling, normally I wouldn't mind this. But in Song to Song I found myself constantly saying, ""what the heck is happening?"" and ""Who are these people?"" and ""Why are they doing these strange mating ritual things and looking away from each other in empty public spaces?"" Those aren't the kind of unanswered questions that make you think.The absolute number one criticism I have for the film is that hardly a quarter of the time are the characters doing anything that I would consider ""normal"" human behavior. Not one natural exchange, not one human emotion that wasn't overridden by self-proclaiming, melodramatic, bourgeois, in-your face filmmaking. It is trying to explore big ideas like trust and betrayal, obsession and connection, and past vs present, but there have simply been far too many films that have already explored these concepts in much better, easily interpreted and more enjoyable to watch ways. Majority of the film is spent with two characters walking in different directions running their hands along poles or walls, and the other half they are doing inappropriate public displays of affection. Also the setting changes almost every shot and there is never any explanation as to why or any logical explanation given as to why they are so alone in these public environments. I thought for a second he was pulling another artistic gimmick like ""they are in their own world"" or something like that, but that reading can't be justified because there is once in a while a few other people around. My condolences to the editors, who had to cut this down for Malick's original 8 hour cut, and the actors who's performances were sabotaged by a crappy vision.",Song to Song
72,JC_Stewart89,Malick's Symphony of Emotions Hits All The High Notes and the Sour Ones,9,16 May 2017,"1969's ""Here Comes the Sun"" by the Beatles. Now that's a song forever etched in my mind, unfortunately not for the reasons it is for most people. Don't get me wrong I love the sugary sweetness of that seminal tune, but there is just one personal problem for me: it became THE song that went to define a particular romance I had years ago. Between the two of us, it was the ballad that 'completely' described our time together. Skipping forward many years after the two of us parted ways that Beatles hit still gets to me in the worst ways because of the memories that are dug up every time I listen to it. It's one of the most cheerful uplifting songs in music history done by a timeless band how could I not succumb to the lyrical warmth that the Paul, John, George, and Ringo gave?The legendary Terrence Malick ever since his critical, and even to an extent mainstream, hit Tree of Life has been a tad... divisive to say the least with his last three feature Films. To The Wonder, Knight of Cups, and now Song to Song have all incurred the wrath of many a film critic and even previous die-hard fans of his for their seemingly aimless stories, overbearing philosophical voice-overs, and esoteric film style(s). Some viewers have even regarded this string of films as self-parodies of the man's work. Needless to say, I don't share the sentiment that Malick has somehow lost his way as a filmmaker, but that doesn't mean I don't understand the frustration felt by many especially after something as monumental and awe-inspiring as Tree of Life. His recent trio of films all center on shaky human relationships, romantic, platonic, and everything in between, involving very complicated and confused people who are not easy to relate to. However, since the enigmatic director tackled the very essence of existence with his 2011 work, isn't it fair that he be allowed to take on more ""grounded"" subject material with his follow-up projects?Set in the Rock music festival scene around Austin, Texas the Director weaves together the lives of four main conflicting personalities each trying to find the right balance of fame, money, love, friendship, and artistic satisfaction. Ryan Gosling is the talented up and comer musician, Michael Fassbender is the hot shot producer that can get him to stardom, Rooney Mara is the off and on girlfriend trying to get her own break in the music scene, and Natalie Portman just hopes to find some sort of stability in her troubled life. It's the kind of cast of lost souls that Malick loves to center his narratives around.The quartet goes to rockin' concerts, vacations south of the border, hard drinking and doing drugs, the usual having the times of their lives. The party has to end, it always does, as the group begins to feel unfulfilled with their escapades and where they are in their respective lives personally and professionally. Characters drift in and out of the focus of the main narrative as they move on to figure out what this lifestyle with all the highs and lows really means to them. It's the usual cautionary tale of attaining fame and wealth and what gets lost along the way, just done through the lens of a cinematic philosopher and maestro.Bringing most of the techniques, camera-work (working again with fellow living legend Emmanuel Lubezki captures the group's highs and lows with an acute eye), and tropes he is well-known for (and hotly criticized for), the thing that is unique this time around for Malick is the emphasis on the power of our Memory. Its hold on us as emotional beings is so great and vast it rather daunting. Each of the characters here shares their memories of past relationships, good and bad, and how they're influencing and shaping their current ones. Now having experience that helps dictate current decision making is one of the more important skills we acquire through our lifetimes, but just how reliable is a memory anyway? How easy is it to be distorted and manipulated in our minds? Isn't memory recall very, if not entirely, dependent on the emotions felt in that moment? How important is the ""true reality"" for us even upon reflection? It's these type of questions that a filmmaker the caliber of Malick always brings up for yourself to answer in your own terms.And that is perhaps what I admire most about the auteur's career, his movies require you to want to participate in them. He alienates, frustrates, and confounds at every turn, but does it so lucidly and beautifully that I have to engage with the screen. I don't blame anyone for not liking his work especially of late, as always to each their own preferences and movie tastes. I can only relate my relationship with the piece. I gather that most can sit and listen to Here Comes the Sun without feeling an ever so slight remorse of a memory long ago. It's all relative in live's pursuits as we go seeking new sensations and making new memories moment by moment and, yes, song to song.9.3/10 (A lucid fever dream of epic emotional scope weaving together the complicated lives of four very conflicting but at the same time dependent people. Can easily alienate an audience, but Malick can only open the door, you have to be willing to walk through it yourself.)",Song to Song
73,cvetkovski_ikee,It is a nostalgic and emotional experience,9,24 June 2017,"It is so beautifully thought film, that it almost seems like an improvisation. Very deep, captivating and honest film leading me to the only question while i was watching it: How old is Malick? I mean, inside? He may be 70 years old, but his films speak about universal feelings. ""Song to song"" is not a conventional film with a conventional story. It's more of a sad and confessional experience, more of a feeling, an emotion long kept inside, finally made into a form of art. It's a film about the characters and their constant battle with themselves. The things we don't see, the hell that goes through one's mind, when one is suffering. They are struggling to get better, but it's so sad because we know they won't. They can't get out. It's about the spiritual journey of the characters and not so much about the story. It only goes where the character goes emotionally. Malick doesn't care about the world around the characters or the society. The only worlds ""well build"" in the film are the character's worlds. That's why the V.O doesn't seem like a technical intervention. It is the core of this beautiful, nostalgic and emotional poem to the ones who are ""destined"" to suffer. Maybe we don't see all of this, cause this is not a modern film and our society doesn't deal with emotions anymore. But i don't thing Malick cares for any of this. He literally makes a film for himself, to try to free himself from his feelings and put it into something useful and creative.The point is, it's not a film to be liked or disliked, cause we, the people can't wait to judge something, and not to try to understand it first. You may just not connect to it. That's it. It's not a memorable film and it won't be, cause after people saw ""The tree of life"", now they get bored with his concept of filmmaking, seeing all of his films like a sequel to it. I found it as more of a pattern that he found to be able to express himself constantly, by really focusing on his emotions and very honestly and artistically opening his soul to the audience to see it. And why not and judge it. 9/10",Song to Song

There's no story, no tension, no emotion, and no reason to care about what any of these characters do.** SPOILER** Even when one of the supporting characters kills herself, what you would imagine would be a large moment in a film where nothing really happens, it's handled matter-of-factly in less than a minute of screen time.If Malick is trying to say anything in this film, it's that he's rich, pampered, and bored out of his mind.",Song to Song

The story is told not like in an ordinary movie, but by scenes that create impressions, so that step by step you understand what is happening in the life of the characters. Therefor this movie is truly an impressionist piece of art. The main actors perform at a very high level but also the appearances of some music artists is amazing. In particular Patti Smith.

My hopes were dashed yet again with ""Song to Song."" The visual beauty is here, but the movie feels bloated, self-indulgent, and disconnected. Malick's technique of splicing together seemingly random footage overlaid with barely audible interior monologue has by now become formulaic, and he seems incapable, unwilling, or afraid to deliver a sustained scene in which characters actually exchange meaningful dialogue. And speaking of characters, one after another is introduced for no apparent reason, as if quantity could make up for the fact that none of them are developed, and their utter shallowness foreshortens any depths the movie might be trying to plumb. Finally, the movie went on so long that I left feeling too exasperated and exhausted to hold on to the shreds of visual beauty that it offered.",Song to Song

I rarely wanted to leave the theater in the middle of a movie so much, and promised myself I would not force myself to endure the same kind of experience again after watching this movie.

80,BeyondIthaka,"Story of love, identity and redemption",10,13 June 2019,"A beautiful meditation on the challenges of love in our contemporary society that eventually takes us to universal truths about our need for grace and redemption. This is epic material. Malick takes us on a journey with young adults wanting success, to find satisfaction in pleasure, hungry for meaning and love but unable to shake off their pasts, conquer their weaknesses. We see the gorgeous life of those that have it all but then are shaken by shadows of what that might lead to. Great cameo appearances by Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, John Lydon and others help remind us of the realities of those struggles for freedom that haunt the protagonists. There are tragedies, family tensions and the voices of our lead characters providing windows into their souls.
There are moments when the film seems plotless but suddenly again drives us back to thinking on the film's deep truths. Here we find a story of people having to find themselves through confession, acceptance of forgiveness, and redemption. I think Malick is actually giving us an interpretation of the Hebrew book 'Song of Songs'. An allegory that speaks of the power of love to transform and save. Watching this was a wonderful experience - the cinematography was breath-taking in places - but ultimately what makes this 10/10 was where else the film can take your soul.

85,nestor-trujillo,A haunting meditation on love & romance,9,2 April 2017,"Am I the only one who absolutely this film? After watching it and reading through a few reviews I felt, as usual with Terrence Malick, unsurprised but wholly frustrated at the glut of criticism towards this film. As expected, they devolved into the typical comments regarding Malick's ""pretentiousness"" and how his style has diminished into overindulgent ""self-parody."" I understand the niche taste Malick has come to cater to (if he really is catering to anyone but himself). I can even understand complaints about his recent films' painfully long runtimes, his static pacing and tone, his tedious, sparse narratives, which are all reasonable and grounded opinions. What I cannot understand are these notions of self-parody because, to my knowledge, parody requires humor and there is nothing funny about the deeply personal stories and haunted characters Malick shows us. There is also nothing pretentious about Terrence Malick. The word ""pretentious"" denotes an attempt ""to impress by affecting greater importance than is actually possessed"" but who are we to claim what is important and what isn't? Even if his films seem affected and contrived to many, they are clearly also important and deeply personal works to him and, in my opinion, to an artist that should be all that matters. 
With that said, Song To Song is perhaps one of Malick's best films yet. I disliked To the Wonder and although I absolutely loved Knight of Cups (my second favorite film from 2017), Song To Song proves to be a much more cohesive work while still managing to transcend time and space as past, present, and future all flow into each other, making the viewer question how the chronology of the narrative might have transpired. In this sense, Song To Song is a cerebral film that challenges the audience to piece together director's landscape of fractured memories and complex emotions. However, in this film it is achieved with much more comprehension, unlike Knight of Cups which utilized a similarly fragmented narrative but then threw us off (or at least me) by giving the false impression of being a linear episodic story. 
It's also impossible to write a review for this film without discussing the music. The music! Malick's approach to the crazed, liberated, drug-fueled music scene in Austin, Texas really embraces the opportunity to introduce a quality rock soundtrack in contrast to his usual classical scores, which is still present but overwhelmingly outnumbered by tracks by Patti Smith (who appears in the film), the Black Lips and, oddly enough, Die Antwoord. The music aids the film's sense of progression and cohesion, as it quite fittingly moves from song to song in a manner that reminded me a lot of another musically-infused romantic film, 9 Songs (Winterbottom, 2004). Though at first this may sound like a gimmick it actually serves a satisfying symbolic function, which is revealed by an important line in the movie that I will not spoil (you'll know it when you hear it). At the very least, it's safe to say that the music helps liven the otherwise brooding tone of the movie while also providing a stark contrast to Emmanuel Lubezki's beautiful cinematography, which I need not even get into. 
Overall, Terrence Malick's latest tone poem captures its subjects with candid grace, like a haunted lover reminiscing on splintered memories with regret and sorrow. As usual, he focuses not on the content of characters' relationships, nor their actions or words, but on the very feeling of being in love, of being torn in half, of being lost and confused. He welcomes you into his own haunted psyche, manufacturing a dreamscape that I trust myself to be immersed in because it is a deeply personal one. At one point, Ryan Gosling's character even speaks to his two brothers, harking back to his earlier film, The Tree of Life, and undoubtedly a parallel to Malick's own tortured past. There is no doubt that the characters in his films are all important parts of him, but they are also parts of ourselves; and the fact that he opens himself up to us which such sincerity in order to allow ourselves to explore our own pain and regrets, is truly a brave act. Ultimately, Song To Song is a phenomenal experience that, like most of Malick's work, is grounded in memory because he understands that it is never the exact details or conversations that we remember, but the pain, the joy, the sadness, and the fleeting moments that meant the most to us.",Song to Song
86,lindhe-1,Waste of a great cast,4,15 June 2017,"I'm giving this film a 4/10 and that's honestly being quite generous. I'll start with the good parts. The acting is quite solid all around and the characters feel believable and real, the only downside is that it sometimes feels a bit too improvised. With a cast this great how could you go wrong?Well it turns out you can go really wrong. The whole movie feels very pretentious and it tries so hard to be deep and philosophical. Sadly it delivers on no parts of that spectrum and ends up just being slow and boring. There are a few interesting parts of the movie, mainly those with music and real artists, but the rest is just unbearable. One upside is that the cinematography is on point most of the time so we see a few beautiful and interesting shots here and there.I've studied film and I try to always give movies a chance but this was honestly painful. It felt like this movie could easily have been one and a half hours shorter.

His films seem to try and address the fundamentals of life, but his last few releases do little more than alienate the viewer due to their lavish backdrops, which don't exist in real life for 99% of the population. Real life doesn't allow us near as much time as these characters have to contemplate it. Contemplation of the meaning of life is a luxury, at least when done on any real level. The pace of every day life simply doesn't allow it. Aesthetically a fairly pleasing film, but insufferable elsewhere most of the time. Tree of Life was the first of this new Terrence, with Knight of Cups solidifying the new framework, but by the time he got to Song to Song it was too much for me. I'll admit I haven't seen Voyage of Time- which I assume is a sort of supplement to Tree- or To the Wonder so won't comment on those insofar as his progression the last few years is concerned. To call Song to Song vapid and frivolous is paying it too much of a compliment, imo. I think the reviewer who called it self-indulgent probably hit the nail on the head best- it's the utmost practice in that. But I feel bad writing like this about a favourite director of mine.

I can't even form a legitimate and educated description of what this movie is about. And believe me, I have sat here for an hour trying to justify the time I wasted watching this.

98,CaffeinatedNation,"A surreal, out-of-body, uncomfortable high",2,10 October 2017,"No character development and the director is so busy trying to figure out which camera angle to use that you end up nauseous with a headache. It's basically 2 hours and 9 minutes of the characters being overly melodramatic, cuts of sighing with longing expressions and pitiful lines about contemplating the meaning of life that leaves you wanting to take yours.",Song to Song
99,starsandsky,The Key,9,22 January 2020,"This film is painted as an icon. Look closely. Listen to the questions the characters ask, then look again.Or, alternately, begin reading. Dante's Inferno, A Picture of Dorian Gray, Brideshead Revisited, the Gospel according to John. Any of these will help you begin to see.Malick begins with songwriters in Austin, but the music they make isn't enough. The love songs are hollow, and they play games with sacred things. It is purposeless clanging. But as they crack, real love rushes in through the crevasses. It is light, green growing things, water, mercy, a child, forgiveness, hope, washing her feet, a wedding ring, carrying one another. Song to Song points to Solomon's Song of Songs.I've not seen any Terrence Malick film before Song to Song and rarely watch movies at all. Terrence, I heard you wish to paint the Christ. I pray for you. For courage. For us all. Thank you for your work.",Song to Song
100,azertyu17357,a special movie from a special director,7,18 June 2017,"i thing this move is just a Terrence Malick classic , i like the story and the way he Presented it where he Avoided the secondary events of the story which not embodied in words and actions , but with the image and cadres as a means to fill the film , but to me the character of Ryan gosling was a deception cause he was constant all along the movie there is nothing special in his role , this story is about love sex and mercy , where Rooney is love Michael is sex and Ryan is mercy . there is so much meanings in this movie that was inspiring to me",Song to Song
101,madeiraramos,If you love perfume commercials...,2,24 June 2017,"It is true, apart from the so so aesthetics, highly enhanced by pop furniture, this ""movie"" is nothing but a two hour long perfume commercial... without the perfume. Nothing's there from minute one. There are things that even good, experienced, well known actors, can't polish. I will waste the exactly same amount of time writing this review as the lads took thinking of this production. 1 for the cast, 1 for visuals= 2. Watch and forget it.",Song to Song
102,craigviau-74241,Take this with a grain of salt as I could only stand 12 minutes,1,29 September 2017,"I'm a real movie fan. love most genre's and styles. However I could not make it through this movie and I don't mean I couldn't finish it. I think I got about 12 minutes in all of it excruciating. How do you describe it. Quick cut scenes with little or no dialogue. No character development. indiscernible plot. Theme is also indiscernible. What's left is setting, you see some nice homes, but not as good as house hunters the TV show.Is there any redeemable value. Well there is .....actually well....maybe.....no none at all. Positively none. They may as well have spliced together 15 random films.",Song to Song
103,rutscholga,Probably the worst movie I've seen so far,1,21 July 2019,"I wasted 2 hours of my life, absolute garbage, do yourself a favor, don't watch this. Read the bad reviews first, those are pretty accurate.",Song to Song
104,isabelherreraih,Disappointed,4,21 March 2017,This film had an all star cast and the story line fell short of keeping anyone engaged. I walked out of the screening due to frustration of the story line being interrupted by artsy shots of Austin. It felt like this was movie with infomercials of the city. I would never watch this film again or finish watching it till the end. I can't take back the hour and half of my life back.,Song to Song
105,debjbright,Don't Bother,1,30 March 2017,"The good: Views of Austin, Texas and the Enchanted Rock (but I'm a Texan.) Acting by cast, especially Rooney, Hunter and Gosling.The bad: No story line to speak of and not a fan of the CONSTANT cutting away from scene to scene. If you are going to have this many people getting ready to have sex, for god's sake, show us a little of the action! If you were a actress in this mess, you got to show off your bellybutton, which was so often, it got to be funny.This movie should have been edited down by an hour and it would have been so much better.Skip it and save your bucks for something better!",Song to Song
106,rjdubb,wow,10,1 April 2017,So........... Here is my history with Malick love all his movies... however after Tree of Life I felt he started to go down a path I really was not connecting with anymore.....To the Wonder was just OK ... Knight of Cups a tad better ( in my opinion) .. but for some reason I absolutely loved this movie... the dream like feeling really worked for me because of all the different stories going on at once. Rooney Mara I feel was the main character and her flash backs made sense and I felt like it was how I would think about a past love interest.... where as other films before this that Terrence Malick made did not connect in that manner.... I kind of feel To the Wonder and Knights of cups were test for this newer style of film making and it was all set up to deliver this movie ... I know some of you may think differently and it looks like half the critics do but this movie really hit home with me and I think it was an absolute home run .... I may have edited out a few nature shots here and there but the acting was top notch... Some people may believe that a traditional film would have worked better for the material but the way it bounces around and flashes really makes sense here.... Some people say Malick is going downhill when I think he was just testing the two previous movies out to make this one... Simply Amazing 10/10 may top Tree of life and Days of Heaven.... IMO,Song to Song
107,pyhproductions,Amazing,10,23 June 2017,"This movie is just epic. In total i have only seen four Malick films, but this one is by far the best one.The cinematography doesn't reach the epic level of 'Tree of life', but it's near. All of the actors and their characters are interesting and mesmerizing, the music is spot on and the script and voice overs are really good. The story grabs you and it doesn't let you go.I loved everything that this movie had to offer, and if you decide to watch it, i really hope you enjoy it too.",Song to Song

Beautiful soundtrack

It deserves a good attention",Song to Song
