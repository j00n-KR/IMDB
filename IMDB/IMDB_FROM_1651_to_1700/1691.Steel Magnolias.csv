0,bkoganbing,An Ensemble Piece,9,3 April 2011,"Robert Harling's off Broadway play based on the death of his real life sister had the good fortune of having him do the screen adaption. In expanding it for the big screen and shooting it in his native Louisiana, Steel Magnolias lost nothing of what he was trying to convey in his one set drama which only involved the six women who are the leads. In fact seeing them interact with other family and friends added well to Steel Magnolias.Still the root of the play is the conversations among six friends in Dolly Parton's Beauty Parlor in a small Louisiana bayou town. The friends are friendly enemies Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine and Sally Field and her daughter Julia Roberts. A new hairdresser is hired by Parton as it turns out on the day that Roberts is to be married and that is Darryl Hannah.Roberts is a diabetic and she takes some very big health risks when she gets pregnant and has a baby boy. These women despite a lot differences and some occasional cattiness are really tight and the health problems of Roberts unites them all.Steel Magnolias should have received a bit more recognition from the Academy than the nomination Julia Roberts got for Best Supporting Actress. If Steel Magnolias is nothing else it's an ensemble piece and recognizing Roberts over the others was unfair. For this story to work, all of the six females have to be good and all of them are.This story has everything, laughter, sadness, great joy, and great pathos. Sometimes the six women are putting out several of these emotions at one time.The best thing I can say about Steel Magnolias is that it is the kind of film you can watch over and over and be moved by it and maybe pick up an emotion you should have felt before in a particular scene. A rare and extraordinary work can do that and Steel Magnolias is a film for the ages.",Steel Magnolias
1,SnoopyStyle,It's a Chick Flick,7,8 March 2014,"Shelby Eatenton (Julia Roberts) is getting married to Jackson (Dylan McDermott). Her parents M'Lynn (Sally Field) and Drum (Tom Skerritt) are getting ready. Things revolve around Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton)'s beauty parlor. Truvy takes pity on the bumbling Annelle Dupuy (Daryl Hannah) hiring her. Next door neighbor Ouiser Boudreaux (Shirley MacLaine) is angry at all the fuss. Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis) loves to crack jokes at Ouiser's expense. Shelby is weak with diabetes. She suffers attacks. She shouldn't have children, but some time after the wedding, she announces that she's pregnant.Sure it's a chick flick. But it's not a frivolous chick flick. There are big emotional melodrama. It's overwrought at times. The impressive cast is able to tame this beast. The best part is that these chicks are good friends. It's a chick flick in the best sense. There are some cute fun moments, some big lines, and some down right sharp jabs. Then there are the big cry moments. It's all there.",Steel Magnolias
2,mark.waltz,"As quotable as an episode of ""Golden Girls""",10,24 March 2010,"I can't praise this movie enough. I've seen it dozens of times, as a play on Broadway, and as a TV pilot with an excellent cast that sadly didn't sell. It is probably one of the most quotable films ever made. The movie was even a major plot device in one of the most popular episodes of ""Designing Women"", which is ironic considering that much later Delta Burke of ""DW"" appeared in ""SM"" on Broadway.This is an ensemble piece of the highest proportions. If you were to ask any person to name a movie where ""ensemble"" is the keyword, ""Steel Magnolias"" would probably rank in the top ten. The major character is Julia Roberts' Shelby, but she is really supporting. It is her life that is the glue that holds all of these people together. Shelby gets married, Shelby has a baby, Shelby gets ill, etc. But it is each of the other characters who put the outside pieces together of this beautifully written Southern poem. Mama M'Linn (Sally Field, whose presence indicates the lead) is a mother hen, gentle and loving in every way, but strong and resistant. (In other words, a Steel Magnolia). When tragedy hits her family, it is her friends who come flocking together to help M'Linn deal with it. They are grouchy Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine at her most eccentric), good-hearted Truvy (the wonderful Dolly Parton, whom ""Designing Women"" focused their hour long episode around), bashful Annelle (an understated Darryl Hannah) and most outrageously, the cheerfully wisecracking Eve Arden of the group, Clairee (Olympia Dukakis). Unlike the play, men are included, and amongst them are Dylan McDermott as Roberts' hubby to be, Tom Skerritt as Fields' rascal husband and Sam Shepard as Parton's distant spouse.The men are there, but it is the women that the film concentrates on. There are also a few other women around in smaller roles, most notably Ann Wedgeworth as McDermott's aunt and ""Porkys"" vet Nancy Parsons (Gym teacher Ms. Ballbricker) as the physically wounded Janice Van Meeter, a victim of a collision with a baseball. ""Looks like two pigs fightin' under a blanket"", Dukakis quips while watching Parsons dance at a wedding reception. (For the record, Parsons was a fine character actress who had only a few opportunities to shine in films; Like the equally stout Shirley Stoler, she could infuse even her nastiest characters with something memorable.) Everybody has great moments, but it seems that most people particularly remember Dukakis and MacLaine's teaming. Yes, they definitely steal every magnolia scene they are in. They are the Lucy/Ethel, Laverne/Shirley, Cybil/Mary Anne. At times they are also a Paul Lynde/Charles Nelson Reilly combo. (Yes, those two did work together.) For the TV pilot, it was Polly Bergen and Elaine Stritch, two ""Follies"" girls makin' with the cracks, and in the Broadway production I saw, it was Frances Sternhagen and Marsha Mason. (I must say that I originally thought of the actors cast in the opposite role in that production, but Ms. Sternhagen was a delightful Clairee who knew how to make each moment she was on stage count. It's ironic to see MacLaine supporting a mother in distress after being the mother in distress in 1983's brilliant ""Terms of Endearment"". After her triumph as Cher's wise mother in ""Moonstruck"" and a few years before her outstanding portrayal of Anna Madrigal in ""Tales of the City"", Dukakis scored this film role which became the final nail in the proof that she was indeed the best not-so-newcomer finding success in middle age even though she was already one of the most respected actresses in the theater. Like her ""SM"" successor Frances Sternhagen, Dukakis is capable of winning laughs and stealing scenes with just a rise of her eyebrow. Up against that, how can Parton and Hannah hold up? They do just fine, but I think they were probably resigned to the fact that opposite that pair, they'd be all but forgotten. Indeed, they are excellent. They have equally great lines: Parton's line about one relative not knowing whether to scratch their watch or wind their behind is a gem, as is Hannah's delivery of the simple line about not letting her personal tragedy get in the middle of her doing good hair. Field gets the real chance to bite into the acting apple as she continues to hold in her grief through each of her sadness's until like a volcano, she builds up and explodes. She is excellent and missed out on a third Oscar Nomination. Check out her physical reaction when, after emotionally blowing up, she witnesses Dukakis's response to the whole scene. It's so filled with spontaneity and realism, and it is priceless. That brings me to Julia Roberts, here a novice in a group full of vets. She scores wonderfully and probably is the least showy. That's probably why the Oscars gave her a nod for Supporting Actress. It's understated and simple, yet filled with humanity, strength, and a quiet acceptance of a fate she can't escape. Stage acting can be big, but successful film acting for the most part meshes all of those qualities together to really touch the heart. While I would choose Dukakis for Supporting Actress, I can see why they nominated Roberts and not the rest of the fine cast. Bill McCutcheon is amusing as MacLaine's old beau who pops up, and Skerritt is funny as M'Linn's scoundrel husband who loves harassing the grouchy Ouiser. But to wrap things up in this long review, I can state that you don't have to be female, Southern, or gay to really get into these women's passionate friendship. The film is sumptuously filmed and features a beautiful musical score that is as touching as the friendship these ladies share. It is obvious that the tales several of these stars have told about making this film (Parton, MacLaine and Dukakis) that they loved working with each other. They should again.",Steel Magnolias
3,kosmasp,Friends,7,14 June 2020,"The basis for this, are the relationships between the characters. But the movie works because of the actors portraying those characters. Dramas can feel dreary to a certain degree and depending on your view of things, you may feel annoyed or enjoy this to a certain degree more or less like others did.Again the core here, the fundamental thing, is the group of people and their dialog. Even when confronted with good news (pregnancy), there has to be a ""bad"" side to it. Something that takes a bit of the good news. Something that gives you reason to feel tense and to care for the characters and understand why not everyone is happy go lucky when they hear the news. This may also help understand women (for some men) - although it would be too easy to just take everything that is being said and apply this to a whole group. Quite complex, but well made",Steel Magnolias
4,classicsoncall,"""I would rather have thirty minutes of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special.""",8,20 March 2021,"When all's said and done, this is pretty much a feel good movie that doesn't have a particularly feel good ending, but in that respect, it's about the circle of life and how we all find a way to navigate through it. I didn't think I'd get as much out of the film as I did, being a guy that is, as the story revolves around six women in a small town who are friends by choice, who move through each other's trials and tribulations with comfort and good humor. Of particular note is the curmudgeonly Ouiser Boudreaux, portrayed by Shirley MacLaine, who for all her irritable ways is accepted by the others because they all know her so well that they're willing to call her bluff most of the time. The handful of guys that appear in the story acquit themselves well enough, but they seem to know their place and don't intrude when it comes to daily gossip, wedding planning, and catty small talk at Truvy's (Dolly Parton) beauty parlor. The title of the picture might give one pause, as it doesn't seem to relate to anything in the story, but upon reflection, it tends to reinforce the idea that when calamity strikes, one must accept those circumstances with steely resolve and find a way to move forward. One note of caution though; the predominant color palette here is overwhelmingly pink, and you'll have to find a way to adjust your feng shui to make it through.",Steel Magnolias
5,lee_eisenberg,Chicken fried by Christians; does that mean that it would taste different if fried by Taoists?,6,14 November 2019,"I had heard about ""Steel Magnolias"" for years, but I only now got around to seeing it (thirty years to the month of its release, incidentally). It's nice to see a female-driven movie, especially one with some of the witty one-liners that we have here. Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis and the rest make a fun team. I guess that the movie would've been more effective had it featured a racially diverse crowd, but as it stands it's a great romp. I liked it.",Steel Magnolias
6,jboothmillard,Steel Magnolias,7,8 December 2008,"I don't know the meaning of the title, I guess it's something to do with all the women in it, but this film is based on the play by Robert Harling, who wrote the screenplay, and directed by Herbert Ross (The Sunshine Boys, The Secret of My Succe$s, Boys on the Side). Basically the film sees many female friends, living in Louisiana, and the whole way through the women all support each other in whatever difficult or emotional situations they are taken into. Shelby Eatenton Latcherie (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Julia Roberts) is getting married to Jackson Latcherie (Miracle on 34th Street's Dylan McDermott), and getting help from mother M'Lynn (Golden Globe nominated Sally Field) and hairdressing friends Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton) and new recruit Annelle Dupuy Desoto (Daryl Hannah). Then there is loads more chat about marriage, men, the menopause and manicures, before all friends, Ouiser Boudreaux (BAFTA nominated Shirley MacLaine), Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis) and the others are brought together for the tragic death of Shelby, which M'Lynn obviously can't handle, but don't worry, there is a happy ending when all of them rush to help Annelle get to hospital to have her baby. Also starring Alien's Tom Skerritt as Drum Eatenton, Kevin J. O'Connor as Sammy Desoto, Sam Shepard as Spud Jones, Bill McCutcheon as Owen Jenkins and Ann Wedgeworth as Aunt Fern. You have to remember that this is based on a play, so it is obvious why there isn't a whole lot of plot or point to the film, it is literally just a load of women, many sassy one-liners, and some compassionate, slightly too sentimental emotional moments, happy and sad, but good entertainment never-the-less. Very good!",Steel Magnolias
7,moonspinner55,Classy cast in a preconceived weeper,5,16 November 2001,"All the characters in this storybook Southern town have storybook names like M'Lynn and Truvy and Shelby and Clairee. After awhile, it gets a little sickening--one longs for a female character named Margaret. ""Steel Magnolias"" is so smooth it's starchy. I admired some of the actresses (Dolly Parton and Daryl Hannah in particular), but the script is just stale bread soaked in soap suds. The movie does play better on television than it did in theaters simply because the material is more suited for the tube, but that doesn't excuse Herbert Ross's lethargic pacing and staging, the rat-rat-a-tat rhythm of the screenplay dialogue, nor the constant overacting by 80% of the women. You certainly can't expect monumental emotions from a picture set in a small town beauty parlor where gossip, romance and lives are played out, but, since this is aimed at ""Terms Of Endearment"" fans, some actual, heartfelt feelings might not be too much to ask. ""Steel Magnolias"" doesn't have them. It's got the frosting all right, but the cake is a fake. ** from ****",Steel Magnolias
8,sunwarrior13,Tough Southern Belles,9,6 October 2012,"Steel Magnolias is a comedy drama that stars Sally Field, Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, Daryl Hannah and Julia Roberts. It is about the bond among a group of women from a parish in the Louisiana area. The film is based on a play Steel Magnolias which in turn dealt with the playwright's experience with the death of his sister.It was written by Robert Harling,who also is the playwright; and it is directed by Herbert Ross. The title refers to those seemingly frail Southern belles who survive any and all deprivations through whims of iron. This is about the story of an all-female cast of characters laughed, cried and compared menfolk.It expands the playing field by including scenes at picnics, hospitals and the like, and by visually depicting the males who never appeared in the stage version. Truvy Jones is the goodhearted beauty-shop owner, while Louisa ""Ouiser"" Boudreaux is the cantankerous town eccentric, decked out in grungy overalls and speaking fluent Trash. Well-to-do M'Lynn Eatenton bravely endures several assaults to her sensibilities, not the least of which is the illness and subsequent death of daughter Shelby Eatenton Latcherie. The movie is a prime example of ensemble film making and it is lovingly coordinated.The performances are first-rate, with the possible exception of Daryl Hannah's over emphatic portrayal of her character.It was a good character study plot which unfortunately had a clichéd and formulaic conclusion.Overall,it was an entertaining film that can make the viewer laugh and cry as he/she relates to the characters.",Steel Magnolias
9,preppy-3,"""The only thing that separates us from the animals is our ability to accessorize!""",10,26 November 2001,"Wonderful, colorful film follows the lives of six Southern women over the course of several years. Sally Field plays the mother of Julia Roberts who's marrying Dylan McDermott. Roberts wants to have a baby...but she has a severe case of diabetes and having a baby may kill her. Dolly Parton is perfectly cast as a beauty salon owner with Daryl Hannah as her shy helper. Shirley MacLaine plays the meanest woman in town. Olympia Dukakis plays her rival (kind of) as the nicest woman in town.The cast alone is great--everybody plays their roles to perfection. Top honors go to Roberts and especially Fields. The script is sharp and witty and the two hour length just flies by. Also it was beautifully filmed on location in Louisiana and there's a wonderful music score also. This has been derided as a mini ""Terms of Endearment"" but it works just as well as that movie did. Also have plenty of tissues on hand for the ending. This is a ""chick flick"" that a lot of guys I know love! Already considered a classic in some circles. I give this a 10.",Steel Magnolias
10,writers_reign,Barbershop Sextet,8,9 June 2012,"Difficult to find fault with this feel good chick flick. Even Shirley MacLaine can't louse it up but it is a young Julia Roberts who crawls away with it despite strong competition from Olympia Dukakis and Sally Field. I was fortunate enough to see the play before I saw the movie, albeit an English production of an American play set in the Deep South which meant it had two strikes on it going in but the quality of the writing overcame that handicap and is evident in this fine adaptation. Friendship is the theme that runs through it and the fact that in this case it is female friendship is more or less irrelevant. There's a nice symmetry in that it begins with the wedding of the Roberts character and ends, to all intents and purposes, with her premature death following a kidney transplant. Films about the South tend to get it wrong as often as they get it right but when they do get it right, as in To Kill A Mockingbird and this one, they really get it right. A winner.",Steel Magnolias
11,evanston_dad,Well Acted Soap Opera,7,4 September 2008,"The material in ""Steel Magnolias"" teeters dangerously on the brink of ""Terms of Endearment"" territory -- maudlin, gloopy and shamelessly tearjerky. But it's saved by its cast, who are able to keep things palatable. The most praise must go to Sally Field, who's perfectly suited to play the tough-as-nails Southern mom who must face losing her daughter, and her breakdown scene in the cemetery after they bury her is a small tour-de-force. Field refuses to let the sentimentality of the script overshadow her performance -- it's a terrific piece of acting.The film also features that tireless work horse, Tom Skerritt, hopelessly under-appreciated as an actor, along with a female cast that includes Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, Daryl Hannah and Julia Roberts, Oscar-nominated for her performance as Field's sick daughter.Grade: B+",Steel Magnolias
12,HotToastyRag,Pretty famous flick with a big cast,5,26 June 2017,"There are so many reasons to watch Steel Magnolias, and once you've watched it, you can cross it off your ""classics to watch"" list and move on to the next one.You'll appreciate the large cast (Shirley MacLaine, Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Sally Field, Daryl Hannah, Tom Skerritt, Sam Shepard, Dylan McDermott) and you'll get a kick out seeing Julia Roberts in the movie just before she donned knee high boots for Pretty Woman. And yes, you'll laugh and shed a tear, but then you'll survive. This isn't Terms of Endearment.Steel Magnolias will appeal to the Fried Green Tomatoes, Crimes of the Heart, and August: Osage County. In other words, it's a movie about a bunch of Southern women muddling through life, with a little tragedy, a few chuckles, and a sweet tea or two. If you like those types of movies, add this to your weekend watch list and start popping that corn!",Steel Magnolias
13,lasttimeisaw,this female-skewing small-town melodrama hits the right spot as a life-affirming motion picture which appeals to a much more overlooked demography,7,14 October 2016,"Based on Robert Harling's play, which is inspired by his own life story, the film version of STEEL MAGNOLIAS is directed by the schmaltz-brewing old-timer Herbert Ross. Emboldened by a pronounced female-centred cast, its narrative gaily situates in a Louisiana parish, where a palsy- walsy clique of (all-white) residents builds up rapport and strong support during the twist of fate, befalls the central Eatenton family.The film starts from the perspective of an outsider, an gauche young woman Annelle Dupuy (an uglified Hannah) arrives in town on the wedding day of Shelby (Roberts), the eldest daughter of M'Lynn (Field) and Drum Eatenton (Skerritt, a delightful comic relief), to work for Truvy Jones (Parton) in her beauty salon. Soon it turns out that Shelby suffers from type 1 diabetes, which implies that pregnancy will subject her life into great danger. If the couple wants children, adoption might be a wiser option, but no, that never gonna happen, Shelby is opinionated in her regressive determination to have a child of her own with a side-note faintly insinuates that perhaps, it is also what her husband Jackson (McDermott) wants despite the huge risk, their marital undertow only alluded during the women folk's regular saloon gossip, and any slant from their opposite sex has been maximally sidestepped (the original play has no male characters in the plot), and Jackson evidently doesn't come off as a model husband, but what comes to fore is the relationship between M'Lynn and Shelby, a mother's completely-selfless affection to her daughter (including donating one of her kidneys) Vs. a young woman's death-defying conviction to become a mother on her own term (latently also to ameliorate her marriage snag), although in hindsight, the latter descends to borderline injudiciousness, but quite tallies with the ethos of its time.Thankfully there are more upbeat subplots, which include a coruscating widow-duo, a graceful Clairee (Dukakis), once was married to the late former mayor, and a cantankerous Ouiser (MacLaine, a salient transformation in her appearance to enhance her senility), they banter, change repartee, bicker, make up, both are sprightly and wonderfully larger-than-life; whereas Annelle also says goodbye to her own troubled past, and finds solace in religion and soon a new husband with a baby on the way; only the relation between a generically spirited Truvy and her offish hubby Spud (Shepard) doesn't pan out effectively in the final product.STEEL MAGNOLIAS is a springboard to leapfrog Julia Roberts into stardom, earns her the very first Oscar nomination at the age of 22 over the more prestigious distaff thespians, still, how can one not be petrified to watch Field's mind-blowing flare-up in the cemetery one-take and in the next second, not get wryly bemused by Dukakis' off-kilter humor to swerve the mood back from abysmal heartbreak? According to my book, a more Oscar-deserving supporting player is the consistently fiery MacLaine, a recalcitrant rebel and nothing can hold her back! By contrast, a dewy Robert only outshines others by design in her one-off diabetes attack sequence.In all fairness, this female-skewing small-town melodrama hits the right spot as a life-affirming motion picture which appeals to a much more overlooked demography, but it is also stalled by its morally provincial material and a slightly over-honed happy-clappy tone to some extent.",Steel Magnolias
14,ElMaruecan82,Where has this breed of women gone ...,8,9 September 2013,"Embracing women's eagerness to spread and comment about gossips, ""Steel Magnolias"" is extremely fertile in witty one-liners and wisecracking exchanges, yet the simple 'life goes on' emerges as the most powerful line, summarizing the very spirit that drove the six ordinary heroines of a small Southern town. You know these towns, where handy jobs are the rule, where rituals and ceremonials regularly punctuate the daily routine, towns with postcard-like charms associated with folk songs and country music, French sounding names for Southern belles and plain monosyllabic ones for guys.The set is tone through the setting: ""Steel Magnolia"" is a woman's movie, where men (more an observation than a critic) are foils, or tender non-entities highlighting their women's wisdom, patience and endurance. Tom Skerrit does pretty well though given the small role he has, stealing the show as a lovable buffoon of a husband. And closing the man's parenthesis, I wonder if the films most emblematic line ""what differentiates women from animals is their capability to accessorize"" didn't include men as parts of these accessories. Still, this is feminine speaking, not feminist, and the difference is huge.Indeed, if one thing, ""Steel Magnolias"" is an ode to female bonding, contradicting the myth of friendship as exclusively masculine. Still, it fairly deals some inconvenient truths notably women's adoration for gossip and benign superficiality. After all, isn't it significant that the arena of their fullest expression is a beauty parlor? The place is owned and managed by the sunny and lively Truvy (Dolly Parton), who hires a newcomer in town, a shy and lanky girl with eyes hidden under a pair of heart-rimmed sunglasses: and whose reluctance to answer basic questions immediately label her as a 'girl with a past', and while you'd expect her new circle to respect her discretion, they surprisingly display more curiosity.The rest of the group includes Julia Roberts as Shelby and her mother M'Lynn played by the quintessential strong-willed and hard-working mother: Sally Field. If the six women represent the community-within-the-community, the group's heart lies on the mother-and-daughter bond. When Shelby is victim of a diabetes attack, she's immediately healed by her mother; M'Lynn knows the process and doesn't panic while giving her orange juice. The signal is clear: this is the part of the story that will matter, starting with the new chapter on Shelby's life: her marriage, a convenient opportunity to introduce all the protagonists -a never-failing plot device since ""The Godfather"".And ""Steel Magnolias"" cleverly uses rituals and holidays as narrative check-points. During Xmas, Shelby announces her pregnancy to M'Lynn, which comes as a shock: because of her health condition, pregnancy was medically frowned upon. Yet Shelby can't do without experiencing motherhood, especially since adoption didn't rhyme with option. M'Lynn is immediately confronted to a heart-breaking paradox: as a mother, while she doesn't understand her daughter's action, she understands her motivations. ""I don't know what I want"" is the most sincere answer she, and any mother, could have come up, with. Anyway, the news are celebrated by the titular magnolias in a sort of ""Que sera sera"" resignation.Yet the health threats keep us on-guard, even after moments of reliefs. Shelby has a boy, but as we expect, her health keeps worsening. ""Steel Magnolias"" remind of ""Terms of Endearment"" on that level, and driven by a similar spirit, it effectively compensates these dramatic moments by comedy, incarnated by the Laurel-and-Hardy-like duo of Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine. Both are widows, MacLaine twice, one embraces life with a theatrical joviality, the other is your typical grumpy old women, MacLaine even borrows some mannerisms and mimics from her Aurora role in ""Terms"". The two elderly women are the salt and pepper that give the film its unique flavor.So ""You'll laugh, and cry... and meditate about life"", sounds like the predictable premise of ""Steel Magnolias"". And it works because Herbert Ross, the director and Robert Harling, the writer never cheat with this premise through over-elaborated plot devices, even I, was surprised by its straight-forward path to the tragic conclusion. It doesn't cheat either because there are many moments that could have easily drown in sentimentality. Not that every comical effect didn't feel awkward, but it takes some guts not to insist too much on emotions in a woman's film. Naturally, the ""Terms of Endearment"" comparison indirectly reflects the film's lack of narrative ambition, but from my own experience, since the night I saw it 20 years ago, I can't look at ""Steel Magnolias"" with cynical eyes.Yes, the magic still works, and the poignancy is amplified by genesis of the play that inspired the screenplay. I learned from the DVD features that the writer wrote the play to cope with the loss of his sister, who died in the same circumstances as Shelby, which makes the film's context and truth-to-life more palpable. Another reason to appreciate the film is to wonder, how differently handled it would have been today. The film is set in the 80's, and whatever it means, at least, we don't have a struggling wife trying to awaken the sexual beast, the mother courage with five kids, including a Gothic teenager who wants a Scorpio tattoo, no lesbian kiss or pot-smoking scene either. ""Steel Magnolias"" rise above these target-appealing considerations: it's about a breed of women that doesn't exist anymore, so much more appealing than the likes of ""Sex and the City"" or ""Desperate Housewives"".""Steel Magnolias"" is about the joys and pains inherent to women, giving life being their greatest blessing and curse given the circumstances, and the film deals with both. It's about the exhilaration of being a woman capable to transcend its innate toughness despite their vulnerable facade. And I guess, I remembered the ""Life goes on"" line more than any other because it sums up what being a mother means: transmitting life's precious sparkle, the same that inhabit their hearts, their eyes, and in some cases, their talkative mouths.",Steel Magnolias

All of them deliver strong performances. I didn't know Dolly Parton so far as an actress, but she was really convincing.The setting is a small town of Louisania. All the holidays of the calendar are shot: Christmas, Easter, and Halloween. It brings a real feeling of the passing of seasons. So you should wait for my enthusiasm. Unfortunately, I haven't kept a sweet remembrance.First, this movie has a ""Frankenstein"" composition. In part an adaptation of a play (which has only one location: the beauty shop), the mix isn't smooth with the screen material.Then, the character of the mother is too overwhelming. She is so anxious for her daughter that she didn't allow her enough free space. When the movie proposes light and happy times, there is always the ""dark"" presence of the mother to spoil them. The movie is thus unbalanced. The sad moments are really really sad, and the happy moments are not really happy.

20,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent tearjerker which is also very funny at times,9,21 November 2005,"STEEL MAGNOLIAS, in my opinion, is an excellent tearjerker which is also very funny at times. I thought that Shelby (Julia Roberts) looked very pretty in her wedding dress. When she went into diabetic shock, I got really scared. One reason I got scared at that point was because I was afraid she was going to die. If you ask me, Ouiser (Shirley Maclaine) was a pure b****! When I saw this, I didn't cry at all. Despite the fact that I didn't cry, I still enjoyed this movie. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent tearjerker which is also very funny at times to any Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley Maclaine, Olympia Dukakis, Daryl Hannah, or Julia Roberts fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for lots of laughter and tears, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.",Steel Magnolias
21,davispittman,One of my absolute favorites!,10,11 July 2015,"Steel Magnolias (1989) tells the story of a group of southern women, including Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Julia Roberts, Shirley Mclaine....... And more! They all gave fantastic performances, Julia even got an Oscar nomination for her supporting performance, and should've won in my opinion, I also think Sally Field should've gotten a nomination as well, and a win! Shirley Mclaine was also a great joy to watch, she really had a funny, charismatic, deep character to dive into, and it was a joy to watch! The plot was so delightful and well executed! Also, the dialogue was so smart and really worked well in the scenes. People tend to believe this is a film strictly for women, a big chick flick, well in some ways, yes, it is a chick flick, but the men will enjoy this movie as well! This is very touching, emotional, well done 1980's southern flick! 10/10",Steel Magnolias

As it focuses on a mother-daughter relationship played by Sally Field and a then unknown newcomer played by Julia Roberts. As Roberts character choose happiness over her health problems with diabetes. Despite Field's misgivings.As Roberts character is going to be married to a then unknown Dylan McDermott.

Since she is going to be a grandma.Dolly Parton is the owner of the beauty shop is a hoot that the movie revolves around. Daryl Hannah as the unrecognizable apprentice and Parton's protégé who is shy at first but really blossoms out during the film. Shirley MacLaine as the grouchy two time widow who has been in a bad mood for forty years. Olympia Dukakis as her only friend and finds a cheerful thing about things and people.

This is a charming yet powerful movie talking place in a small town in the south, it's sort of become legendary as one of THE tearjerkers and also one of Julia Robert's best roles.I saw this so long ago but really liked it, normallly NOT my kind of movie but this was enjoyable from start to finish. Obvously it is a weeper of a movie(bring the Kleenex) and tragic at times, can't really explain why some tearjerkers get it right and some just seem to typical, contrived whatever. But Steel Magnolias got it right. I actually know men, who hate films like this, who like Steel Magnolias. This seems to be the rare type of chick flick that can be enjoyed by both women and men. I do remember when I first saw it, thinking in the theatre, I might not wanna see it again because it was just to MUCH of a tear jerker. I mean sometimes, no matter how much one likes dramas, a movie can just be a bit to heavy. But I've since changed my mind about this, I actually probably would watch it again, It's a great movie that still makes me smile all these years later. I'd recommend it if by chance someone reading this has yet to see it, but I'll say it again-Bring The Kleenex!",Steel Magnolias
25,eric262003,Nice Transition From Stage To Screen,8,8 May 2018,"I liked to be entertained. There's no denying that. Whether stage, screen or social media, if you entertain, you'll leave me with a smile on my face. Between stage and screen, screen is my top priority. Not that I'm bashing theatre at all, the artistic merit put into these productions are well crafted and carry a great level of energy to linger on inside of you. But when plays and musicals evolve onto the big screen I like to see if they are able to successfully transition themselves and capture the same amount of applauds to the bigger audience as they did with the smaller crowds. From 1989, ""Steel Magnolias"" successfully went to that direction to where everything was located in one particular setting and bringing camera crew to film it in multiple settings in a two hour duration.Set in a small village in Louisiana, the opening scenes are on the eve of Shelby Eatonton's (Julia Roberts) wedding to Jackson Latcherie (Dylan McDermott). She and her mother M'Lynn (Sally Field) go and get their hair done at a local salon owned by Truvy Jones (Dolly Parton). Joining them are their friends Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis), Ouiser Boudreaux (Shirley McLaine) and spend the day talking about town life and the latest gossip. Joining them is Truvy's newest employee, Annelle Dupuy Desoto (Daryl Hannah). Picking up from their conversations we learn that Shelby and Jackson have had their differences lately and that Shelby is a diabetic. We also get the invitation to explore further into the lives of these women in both their happy and sentimental times. but through all their trials and tribulations, they are always there for each other like sisters of different age groups.Granted, the average movie fans are more infatuated with high adrenaline and stories with complex plots. And I'm part of that majority as well, But it's still a welcome to have simplistic stories that come around from time to time with characters we can easily invest in. Through a series of vignettes, we can get a better understanding of the characters and find a likeness through each and everyone of them without falling victim to any elaborate plot twists. The reactions of these women's lives whether good or bad are absolutely priceless. And though the focal character in this film is around Shelby, their really is no leading performer as each character has their moments in the sun.The original play was situated solely in Truvy's salon, but the movie freely locates the settings to other public venues in the outskirts of the small town in Louisiana like a carnival, a church and a hospital. But the majority of the film is still at Truvy's which was based on the play by Robert Harling who also wrote the screenplay this movie is based on. The dialogue as whole is very memorable with plenty of humour and at times can also be touching. But when these women collaborate, they touch upon a myriad of topics, some of may be gossip, but nothing cringe worthy, but a lot of their subject matter is on life and love. Sure the talk presented here is done with sincerity whether talking about others or themselves, but it helps prevent itself from just being another face in the crowd when it comes to chick flicks. But the nice thing about ""Steel Magnolias"" is that it never portrays Southerners in a negative way. They're loving and caring individuals and they don't come across as illiterate or racist.Though a far cry from anything considered a masterpiece, ""Steel Magnolias"", it is too dependent on dialogue from Herbert Ross, it's still a clever story that is never bogged down with clutter. The acting was very impressive with a variety of emotional depth from Sally Field and Shirley McLaine being the scene stealer is quite notorious at being. If there was one real red herring about this movie was the unnecessary use of the epilogue as the curtain closed. I liked the message of hope it delivers to you, but we really needed a more uplifting happy moment after an incredibly emotional third act. But instead the movie cops out by injecting ideas of another movie in the making instead of just wrapping up the film and letting the characters move forward in their lives. In spite of that shortcoming, ""Steel Magnolias"" has aged gracefully to create a great story with larger than life characters with memorable quotes one will remember once the credits begin.",Steel Magnolias
26,philip_vanderveken,The crossing of a comedy with a typical dramatic TV-movie,6,15 May 2005,"Reading the tag line for this movie really made me curious. ""The funniest movie ever to make you cry."" What can you possibly expect when reading a line like that? Will it be a comedy that is so funny that it will make you laugh so hard that you cry? Will it be a tragic movie that brings its message in a funny way? I really didn't know, but I sure was curious, so I gave the movie a try.Everything in this movie revolves around a beauty parlor in a small parish in Lousiana. A close group of friends meets each other regularly in this salon. These women do not always seem to have much in common, but they are friends and here they share all their good moments like for instance marriage, pregnancy, a new start of life... and bad moments like for instance the death of a dearly beloved, together.If I think of the different characters, than I must say that I loved Shirley MacLaine as Ouiser Boudreaux most. She was excellent as the grumpy old lady who seems to hate everybody and everything in that little town. In my opinion the other characters aren't as great as MacLaine's, but are OK to watch, although they don't exactly feel 'real'. At first I even thought that this entire movie was some kind of parody on the Southern culture and more in particular on the people that live in Louisiana. But after reading some posts in the forum of this movie, this is apparently how the people over there really are. It's supposed to be in present time, but it feels like time stood still 50 years ago and never started running again. The way they look, act and think certainly doesn't match with my idea of a more modern United States...All in all this is a movie that seems to balance somewhere in between a typical dramatic TV-movie and a comedy and to be honest, it didn't convince me much. It certainly isn't the worst movie ever, but it is a typical chick-flick. Normally I don't have any problems with that, even though I'm a man, but with this one I did. That's why I give it a 6/10.",Steel Magnolias

28,Spuzzlightyear,Get your hankies out!,7,5 August 2005,"Steel Magnolias is the type of movie that just practically SCREAMS ""Woman Picture!"" as you have the star-power of the century here, what with a then-unknown Julia Roberts, Shirley Maclaine, Sally Field, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, and Daryl Hannah all competing to tug the heart strings. The story focuses around Julia Roberts, and the key points in her life. Her character, Shelby, is diabetic, but that doesn't stop her from getting what she wants, much to the chagrin of her Mom, played here by Sally Field (Very good casting there btw) and much to the concern of the girls at the beauty shop where they regularly hang out in. There, that's all I'll say about the plot, because if I say any more, then I will spoil it for you. It's fairly intricate, but the whole cast holds it together quite well. It's easy to see how amazed people were when they first got a glimpse of Julia Roberts in this film (Maclaine states that she got her agent to sign her on after seeing her work on the film, I think Shirley is trying to hog the credit). Parton is great, Hannah is okay, Maclaine is wonderful in a out of character role, Dukakis is smart as always, and Sally Field, despite a ""LOOK AT ME ACADEMY!"" speech at the end, is powerful as usual. As well, it's always great to see Kevin J. O'Connor used so well. He's an actor that I always take a pleasure of seeing.",Steel Magnolias
29,MrGKB,Not as strong as the play,7,11 May 2003,"I am moved to comment on this film only because I just finished directing a production of the original play upon which it is based.
The play is better.Just as Terrence McNally diffused and weakened his powerful drama, ""Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune,"" by taking it outside the humble walk-up in which it was set, so playwright/screenwriter Robert Harling has diluted and homogenized the power of his own work in adapting ""Steel Magnolias"" to the big screen.Not to say that the result is as disappointing as was the case with ""Frankie and Johnny...""; it isn't.  But, in my opinion, the film loses something in the translation.  Perhaps it's the intrusion of the menfolk into the story; in the play, they are never seen, only talked about, and this isolation gives more strength to the bonding of the women.  Movies, of course, with rare exception, demand more than a unit set and moving so much of the action (such as it is) outside of Truvy's beauty shop tends to soften the dramatic tension that the play so lovingly builds to a cathartic release. 
Make no mistake, the film is still effective, thanks mostly to strong performances by the six leads, and cinematography that captures the full Southern charm of Chinquapin Parish, Louisiana (played with authority by Natchitoches, LA).  But if you like the film, I must recommend that if you haven't caught the stage version, you owe it to yourself to do so.",Steel Magnolias
30,gftbiloxi,Flawed But Extremely Entertaining Mixture of Comedy and Drama,8,2 October 2005,"An extremely episodic story of several smalltown southern women whose social lives revolve around meetings in the local beauty parlor, STEEL MAGNOLIAS' script and performances are dogged by an aura of artificiality--but it scarcely matters, for the film is a tremendous amount of fun.Some of the performances are more successful than others, with Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Julia Roberts, and Darryl Hannah coming out on top (I am greatly surprised that so many other reviewers dislike Hannah's performance, which seems to me considerably less artificial than many others--but perhaps since I'm actually Southern I have a different perspective). Sally Fields and Dolly Parton are less successful, but not in any sense that actually distracts from the fun. Perhaps most surprising in a film which focuses on women are the brief but impressive performances from the male supporting cast, which includes effective performances by Tom Skerrit, Sam Shepherd, and Dylan McDermott, and which serve to ground the film with a sense of the broader community in which the women live.The script abounds in zinging one-liners (""If you can't say something nice, come sit by me!"") and often hilarious situations (imagine Olympia Dukakis surrounded by naked men in the highschool football team's locker room); it also contains some very touching segments sure to choke up all but the most heartless viewer. And although the story is extremely manipulative and rather predictable, those factors don't actually get in the way of its effectiveness. While probably not a ""great film"" by any serious standard, it is tremendously good-natured, well-intended, and extremely entertaining, and most people will find that it lingers pleasantly in mind and holds up well under repeated viewings.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Steel Magnolias
31,gkeith_1,Powerful scenes,10,6 January 2008,"A powerful scene by Julia Roberts: she goes into a diabetic attack. It was great emotional and physical acting, and I was stunned at how excellently she did it. All the women helping her, especially her mother, showed true concern about her well-being.It must be pointed out, however, that anyone with diabetes does not necessarily have attacks like this. Someone I knew just used to pass out, with no violent symptoms. Nowadays, with Type 2 diabetes in so many people, their only untoward symptom seems to be too-high blood sugar when they do the finger-stick.Shirley MacLaine with the dog: a powerful speech with strong emotional portrayal. The dog has just been pointed out as some kind of what-cha-ma-callit who would look like a St. Bernard if it had hair.Dolly Parton's character is encouraging and calm.

32,Isaac5855,Laugh Till you Cry...,8,30 November 2005,"Another movie that is part of my permanent video collection and never get tired of watching, STEEL MAGNOLIAS is the beautifully expanded version of Robert Harling's play about the relationship between six women who frequent the same beauty parlor. I am pretty sure the first phrase that comes to mind for most people when this film is mentioned is ""Chick Flick"", but, as a male, I happily admit to loving to watch this movie over and over again, not just because of the six charismatic performances by the actresses, but because this film also has one of the funniest screenplays ever written. Claree: ""The only thing that separates us from the animals is our ability to accessorize."" Truvy: ""Ruth Robeline...now there's a story...her whole life has been an experiment in terror...first her husband was killed in WWII and then her son was killed in Vietnam... I tell you, when it comes to suffering, she's right up there with Elizbeth Taylor."" Claree: ""well, you always know what I say...if you can't think anything nice to say about anybody, come sit by me."" Ouiser: ""I'm not crazy...I've just been in a bad mood for the last thirty years."" And just when you think your sides about to split open from laughing so hard, the film takes a tragic turn and you're reaching for the Kleenex. The scene in the cemetery is riveting, thanks primarily to a flawless and raw performance by Sally Field, who climaxes what is already a beautiful and commanding performance in the film, with her rage against God as her only outlet of grief at the moment. This scene makes me cry every time I watch the movie. An appeal to the gentlemen out there who have never seen this movie: Give it a chance. I did and I have never regretted it.",Steel Magnolias

The story begins with Roberts' wedding, then carries on through the ups and downs of the friends' lives. The men in the story are secondary characters, and occasionally come across as a bit selfish (Roberts' husband), or buffoons (Hannah's boyfriend), yet one of the joys of this movie is that you come to love the women so much, you don't mind the men's shortcomings, and start liking them, too!The standout performances of the film are from Roberts, and MacLaine, as a spinster with a sarcastic tongue, and, ultimately, a heart of gold. Her scenes with Dukakis are hilarious, yet full of the warmth that makes this film so special!A couple of things usually overlooked, but worth mentioning; the enchanting film score (I wish the soundtrack would be re-released!), and a bit part by Janine Turner, before 'Northern Exposure' made her a star.This is a very special film, for both Roberts' fans, and anyone who wants to believe in the healing powers of friendship.

The male support actors such as Sam Shepherd and Tom Skerritt are excellent. The trouble is that the film's roots as a stage play are too obvious. Scenes are packed with dialogue and people standing around emoting. And there's not enough plot.

The film gives us a glimpse into their daily lives over a period of several years, their laughter, their joy, and their tears, all through the lens of their enduring friendship.Here are the six magnolias...M'Lynne (Sally Field)...perhaps the steeliest of all the magnolias, who has a bittersweet relationship with her grown daughterShelby (Julia Roberts)...everyone's favorite girl next door, M'Lynne's endearing, diabetic daughter; we see her planning her very pink wedding (wait till you see the groom's cake!) and charting a difficult path, given her medical history Truvy (Dolly Parton)...the married but lonely hairdresser with the heart of gold, who owns and operates Trudy's Beauty Parlor, center of social life for these ladies, site of gossip, teasing quips, and comfortOuisser (Shirley MacLaine)...the sarcastic spinster and cantankerous comic relief who is frequently seen carting her little dog around and exchanging barbs with her Old Nemesis, M'Lynne's husband, Drum Clairee (Olympia Dukakis)...the charming, gossiping widow and town bigwig Annelle (Daryl Hannah)...the shy, awkward new girl in town, who has a mysterious past and lands a job at the beauty parlor, under Truvy's mentoring Through these six, we see the strength that lies behind the legendary Southern lady's charm (well, maybe Ouisser's not that charming!) and supposed flower fragility, their humor, their optimism, their faith, and above all, their banding together and supporting each other in the face of adversity.I understand that this movie is based on a well known play by a famous Louisiana playwright. The women depicted in the film are by and large good Christian, church going folk, which is laudable. My initial reaction was to blame Hollywood for mocking Annelle's newfound deep faith and having her act as though she hadn't a clue in her dim witted Southern head. The playwright may have intended to cast her as going overboard and being too judgmental. If so, I personally don't consider this a kind or necessary depiction, and find Annelle to be very sincere and kind hearted.However, otherwise this is simply a ""funny tearjerker"" and a great movie.",Steel Magnolias

39,macpherr,Solid story telling!,9,28 August 2000,"Steel Magnolias has a wonderful cast, and the script Robert Harling ( First Wives Club),  is great!  He is a solid story teller. The story has humor, conflict,  tragedy, and is very educational, showing the different aspects of diabetes. The filmography by Oscar nominee and Golden Globe winner, among others awards,  Herbert Ross (Undercover Blues, The Goodbye Girl,  The Turning Point) is impressive, worth a look. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is that they manage to turn beautiful and extremely elegant,  Daryl Hannah (Grumpy Old Men, Legal Eagles) into an ugly and off beat character. She is very flaky and weird in this movie. It shows that she has talent. I believe that  Julia Roberts (Mystic Pizza, Notting Hill, Erin Brockovich) really knows how to pick her roles.  She has a great personality,  and I say this not only because she is cute because she is, but because Julia is always positive, smiling, and joking around. I have most of her movies on tape. She is also a great actress. Her accent in this movie is great.  Many of the actresses in this movie are from the South.  Dolly Parton (Nine to Five) is from Tennessee; Shirley MacLaine (Evening Star, Guarding Tess, Postcards from the Edge) is from Virginia; and Sally Field (Norma Rae, The Flying Nun) has been exposed to the South. They are all good in their accents and roles. My favorite role in this movie is Ouiser played by Shirley MacLaine. I might not agree with  Shirley's ideas, but I watched her interview in ""Inside the Actors Studio"" and she is brilliant and witty. The movie also has the brilliant actors Tom Skerritt (A River Runs Through It) and Sam Shepard (Crimes of the Heart). If you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it.  You will laugh a lot, and get the chance to see Dylan McDermott (The Practice) in one of his first roles. My favorite quotes: M'Lynn: ""That church looks like it's been hosed down with Pepto-Bismol."" Truvy: ""When it comes to pain and suffering, she's right up there with Elizabeth Taylor."" Truvy: ""Oh, Sammy's so confused he don't know whether to scratch his watch or wind his butt."" Ouiser: ""I'm not crazy, I've just been a very bad mood for the last 40 years!""

40,Pookyiscute,Probably my favorite movie...,10,8 April 2006,"Although there are several films that I would rank in the top ten best of all time, this is probably my favorite, and is a good past time to watch that never lets me down. As many times as I've seen this film (and it's a lot), it never fails me; with tears, laughter and excellent acting and reality. Julia Roberts, as I recall was nominated for her portrayal as a young woman with diabetes, and in my opinion, should have won for this and not for ""Erin Brockovich"". But, the real gem and overlooked one in the movie is Sally Field. This is by far and away, her best role and performance she ever snagged, and nailed, and I rank her performance in this as one of my top five best performances in motion picture history of all time.All the characters and performances in this are excellent, including one such, by Daryl Hannah, who I don't care for, but love in this movie. In fact, her character Anell, is the only role I've ever liked her in, and applaud her work in it.Among the cast there are very few men, but my favorite is Tom Skerrit, who plays Sally Field's husband, and father to Julia Robert. Shirley MaClain, Olympia Dukakis, and Dolly Parton are the other three co-stars, that follow behind the three previous, and all make their characters unique.The basis of the film, is a beauty parlor, and although it might sound hokey, it's really not. Some might call it a chick flick, but I have to say that I know men have even gotten teary-eyed from this film. It's wonderfully directed, only in that, it makes you feel apart of the never ending friendship that's between this group of women. The experiences that they have and the trials and tribulations they go through. Although not the whole movie is set in the hair salon, a good portion of the film is, but it is done in just the right amount, and is written very well.I recommend it for girls of all ages, and men who want to impress their girlfriends with a great flick for a Friday night. It is one of the best films of all time, and if for no other reason, you should watch this merely to see the performance Sally Field gives, because it is amazing.",Steel Magnolias

The best lines from the play are now blasted by assured Hollywood divas and overemphasized by director Herbert Ross. The characters seem to be quoting bumper stickers.The male characters feel gratuitous because they have nothing of consequence to say or do. Darryl Hannah never lets you forget she's cast against type, and Dukakis, Parton and Maclaine never let you forget they're acting. Roberts who has the most sugarcoated role comes off better while Field manages some impressive emoting. The dialog still gets laughs, and Field may move you to tears, but overall it reminds me of The Golden Girls(TV).",Steel Magnolias
45,wnterstar,Wonderfully sad,8,21 April 2006,"This is one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled. It follows the lives of 6 women in a small town, showing us the fights, the feuds, and the friendships. We see them rejoice at weddings, and births, we worry with them when one of their own is sick, we cry with them when one dies.The best part about this movie is that it shows us two things.1. True friends are always there for us. That even when you don't like the person very much, you still love them and will stand by them.2. Even though they are considered the ""weaker"" sex, it's usually the woman who ends up dealing with life's trials and tribulations, while the men avoid the pain.It's a great movie to watch, just remember to have plenty of tissues available.",Steel Magnolias

Robert Harling, the playwright, who wrote the play had a sister who had diabetes. Her's was just like Shelby's. It was very serious and having a child was life-threatening. However, though she went right ahead and had one anyway because she was afraid she would be denied one through adoption. Susan was her real name. He wrote the play for her of course.

48,clydestuff,Excellent cast makes high class soap opera work,7,5 April 2003,"Steel Magnolias may be nothing more than manipulative high class soap opera, but it is soap opera that works, thanks to a good script and some first class performances by an excellent cast.  If you are looking for edge or your seat drama, you're shopping in the wrong store here.  What you do get is a story about relationships.  The main focus is the story of a friendship between five women, each character totally different, but very well defined by the five actresses who portray them.  There is also a major story about the relationship between a Mother and Daughter, some minor stories involving girlfriend and boyfriend, and husband and wife.  It is the actresses who make this movie watchable, Sally Field hits all the right notes as a mother who at times can seem overbearing to her daughter, but as we find out with good reason.  Dolly Parton as a beauty shop owner gives her best performance ever here, and for once doesn't try to draw our attention to her anatomy. Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis are stellar as two women who you are always trying to one up the other, but who deep down really care about each other.  The biggest surprise here is Daryl Hannah, who plays a mousy church goer.  It is probably her best performance to date.  Julia Roberts, in an early role as Sally Field's daughter, does a fine job also.Although the male roles don't have much screen time, they are still pivotal to the story, and Tom Skerritt, Sam Shephard, Dylan McDermott, and Kevin J. O'Connor, give performances every bit as good as the ladies. It's great to watch a movie where on the surface there doesn't seem to be much happening, but challenges you to listen to the dialogue between the characters.  Steel Magnolias is just such a movie, and does it better than most.",Steel Magnolias

There were some good moments, some woman kinship and whatnot, but it just didn't connect. I think it's me though My woman kinship bits might be broken. It's not completely out of the question, I'm not big into female family Yaya Sisterhood stuff, where woman moan and groan and act all unreasonably crazy.I'm a bit too cynical. I guess because there were some deep moments, but mostly predictable and uncalled for because there was no reasoning behind them. Also, I don't really care for the huge gaps of time with the poor transitioning.I guess this gripe just has to do with the semi-high expectation since Sally Fields and Julia Roberts is in this film and it just wasn't that spectacular.

I love Julia Roberts, Shirley MacLaine, Sally Field, Dolly Parton and Daryl Hannah. The film has plenty of laughs,tears, joy, sharing of experiences...it's got something for everyone, male and female.Shirley MacLaine's character, Ouiser, the town grump is just what the film needs to shed light on comic relief and realism. I tell ya, my mom and I have had a lot of laughs over the scene where Ouiser first meets Annelle (Daryl Hannah) and gives her the feminist's outlook on men (""Men are the most horrible creatures, honey. They will ruin your life, you mark my words""). Along with that there are the tears. Shelby (Julia Roberts) is a diabetic who wants to have a baby and puts herself at a great risk. She ends having to have a kidney transplant with her mother, M'lynn (Sally Field) acting as the only likely donor. However, they do not act in time and sadly, Shelby dies. The scene with M'lynn going ballistic after the funeral is both heart-wrenching and makes a sudden turn into comic relief. Dolly Parton and Olympia Dukakis make for a delightful rounding of the group with their cynical remarks on men, Christianity and issues involving homosexuals.

Shelby (Julia Roberts, 'Mystic Pizza') and her mother, M'Lynn (Sally Field), take a trip to the local beauty parlour to allay Shelby's pre-wedding nerves. Run by their companion Truvy (Dolly Parton), who has just recruited the shy, nervous Annelle (Daryl Hannah) as an assistant, the parlour becomes a place for the women to trade tips of advice on life, love, and hairstyles, with the constantly bickering Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine) and Clairee (Olympia Dukakis) popping in for a chat. The tight circle of friends strengthens and continues to last well after that day in Truvy's beauty parlour, with each having shoulders to cry on when things don't always go right.Robert Harling has done an exemplary job of re-styling his own play for the big screen. 'Steel Magnolias' is certainly no stranger to momentous plot movements and interpersonal melodramas, but the film rarely feels like it's squeezing the tears out of your eyes, mostly thanks to the wonderful acting on display here. Every single one of the leading ladies are on top form, with Julia Roberts in particular offering up a breakthrough performance as the bride-to-be. But Field, Parton, MacLaine, Dukakis and Hannah are equally as good, with director Herbert Ross ('Footloose') letting the cast-mates simply beam off the screen.

The main title music, along with Herbert Ross' visuals, exudes all that is good and decent about small town life.  It reminds me of Elmer Bernstein's beautiful main theme for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".The DVD allows the viewer to isolate the music away from the dialogue and sound effects.

60,buzzerbill,A chick flick with backbone--from a guy who hates chick flicks,8,20 October 2008,"Both Gregory the Movie Cat and I loved this movie. (Gregory gave it just short of a complete purr. Like me, he knows that this is a film with Julie Roberts before she really learned to act.) To get one central issue off the table--Julia Roberts is largely irrelevant here. She's beautiful, she's doomed, she dies young. She is largely uninteresting but for what surrounds her--and that is what makes the film completely enjoyable.To begin with, this is the real South, not warmed over Scarlett O'Hara. And what comes with the real South is a very creative use of language. The real strength of the film lies in the screenplay, which rarely if every hits a wrong note. Truvy proclaims that ""Smiling through tears is my favorite emotion,"" and the screenplay captures that complex of emotions extremely well. And is extremely funny, from throwaway lines like ""My personal tragedy will not interfere with my ability to give good hair"" to the denouement of the emotional scene right after Shelby's funeral--""Hit Ouiser!!"" In addition--and this is really rare--all the casting is good. Even Julia Roberts--she really can't act, but she looks completely right. I have to single out Shirley MacLaine. Much as I like her, the fact is that for the last twenty years she has been giving performances that, charitably, can be described as trainwrecks--you have to watch them, but they are horrible. Ouiser is a trainwreck as well, but a really, really interesting one.Finally, Steel Magnolias was filmed in one of the most beautiful towns in the US, and that certainly shows.This film is a comedy with a serious interlude. It is virtually impossible to dislike. Guys, it is a chick flick that you can enjoy without mental damage. In short--perhaps not the very peak of the cinematic art, but a really funny and enjoyable evening.Highly recommended to all.",Steel Magnolias
61,LeathermanCraig,The classic DRAMEDY with Excellent Southern Style!,10,9 July 2004,"This movie is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITES, and will always have a spot in my personal movie collections....  With an all-star ensemble cast, witty dialogue and a drama-driven, comedic story line, 'Steel Magnolias' is a classic that will make you laugh and cry - and sometimes make you laugh UNTIL you cry!The story line revolves around a Louisiana family - The Eatentons - played by Sally Field (as M'Lynn - the mom), Julia Roberts (Shelby - the daughter), Tom Skerrit (Drum - the father) and Tommy & Jonathon - the younger brothers. The time frame starts off as we see the family getting ready for Shelby's pending nuptials to Jackson Latcherie (a then, somewhat unknown Dylan McDermott)....  All of the drama of a big family is impacted by the marriage and getting ready for it.  Of course, there is the typical drama between the bride and her mom - with M'Lynn wanting a picture perfect wedding - HER way - while Shelby is looking for her own signature touches - such as it is.Of course, given that there are all the lives that touch the Eatenton's - such as Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine), Clairee Belcher (Olympia Dukakis), and Truvy (Dolly Parton).  Truvy runs a local beauty parlor out of her home.... Anelle (Darryl Hannah - looking as un-pretty as possible!) is a new comer to town, having been brought to the area by her drifter (and drug dealing husband!) and needing to find a job...  So, Anelle comes to ""Truvy's Beauty Spot"" for a job and gets involved in the drama...  Truvy also gets into 'discussions' with her husband, Spud (Sam Shepard).  He's an under-employed construction worker, trying to help make ends meet.No spoilers here, as there are so many little story line points that pop up from time to time between the characters and with their histories.  Shelby is a diabetic, with all that goes along with it.  Ouiser is one of the richest women in town, and is currently single - leading to all sorts of interesting liaisons.  Clairee is the 'former first lady' of the Parrish, having been married to a former civic leader, until his death a few years previously.  Ouiser and Clairee are best pals - with all of the friendship and rivalry that goes along with that....  In many ways, they come off more like siblings...The cast works exceptionally well together.  The lines and dialogue are witty and biting, and there are many times that you will have to stop and go back a scene to catch them!  Many times, when the women are all together, the lines and barbs fly!  Listening to them banter back and forth is classic - reminding one of their own family and friends.So, get some friends together, gather up some snacks and drinks and plop down on the sofa to watch this classic dramedy!  You won't soon regret it! And, don't be surprised if you and your pals start popping off lines from the movie.....  ""...ya know I loves ya more 'n my luggage!""",Steel Magnolias
62,rhoda_s_girl,Good movie,9,2 March 2020,Personally despite all the critics naysays I thought this was a pretty good movie...The ending made me tear up and I thought all the actors died a good job playing their character..The relationship between sally fields and her daughter were especially heartwarming plus some good one liners. I know some people thought the end was too schmaltz but personally loved how they highlighted a women's life for her child and no matter what she wanted to give birth to a baby even when dr etc were saying she shouldn't. I think especially nowadays that would be so refreshing to see when the world instead seems to act like being pregnant is an imposition at times and all the crazy feminist keep saying there is so much more to life. Although have nothing against people who don't have children or doesn't necessarily want them I also think being a mother is one of the most rewarding things that can happen...,Steel Magnolias
63,bbbaldie,A Great Collection of Actors' Moments,9,4 August 2001,"Everything came together for this one. Even though many of the drawls were make-believe, the following actors had shining moments here: (the much-overlooked) Tom Skerritt, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, and (perhaps the role that demanded the most) Daryl Hannah. Julia Roberts had one heck of an introduction, too. Yeah, I know, it wasn't her first, but it's the one that got her noticed. Another unfortunately overlooked actor, Sam Shepard, was his usual quietly excellent self too.
This movie was a joy to watch, and I'm an Oklahoman who normally detests Californians attempting to talk ""suthen."" It's been called the king (queen?) of the chick flicks, but I (a dedicated fan of Blazing Saddles, the penultimate anti-chick flick) beg to differ. This is an intriguing look into the world of the Louisiana beauty shop, a place off-limits to males. It makes you laugh, cry, laugh, laugh, cry, and laugh, in that order.
Guys, go rent this one and watch it with that special lady. You'll get full credit for being sensitive, yet have a few honest belly laughs in the process. Who could ask for more?",Steel Magnolias
64,AlanSKaufman,A Diabetic's Sweet Treat,10,2 February 2006,"Please forgive the cuteness of my title, ""A Diabetic's Sweet Treat"", by allowing me to demonstrate why it encapsulates the message of Steel Magnolias.Twenty five minutes into the movie, earlier comedic moments turned into horror as I watched Shelby shaking uncontrollably in the beauty shop chair, resisting those attempting to help her. The scene was terribly accurate, reflecting my personal experience under insulin shock. Introspective though I am, I find it arduous to describe one's feelings in that dire situation, but as a picture is worth a thousand words, Julia Roberts' dramatic performance is priceless in conveying the diabetic's plight.The director's DVD commentary reveals how he wanted the actors in this pivotal sequence to appear upbeat despite their characters fearing Shelby's wedding might endanger her fragile health: everyone was supposed to be hoping otherwise. But the mechanics of filming this emotional mixture proved incredibly difficult and after countless takes, the cast began feeling anxious, unintentionally adding the necessary realistic undercurrent.This upbeat anxiety promotes a saccharine quality to life instead of a natural sweetness, similar to consuming sugarless and tasteless low fat stuff to maintain a healthy diet. So Sally Field as Shelby's mother M'Lynn conceals an anger with God that bad things happen to good people. Daryl Hannah as Annelle prays to Jesus by rote. Ouiser, played by Shirley MacLaine, behaves obnoxiously, frustrated by her failures with men. Dolly Parton as Truvy avoids loneliness by busily working. Olympia Dukakis as the grieving widow Clairee gossips and spars with Ouiser. All find focus on Shelby, who has the toughest journey.A fascinating paradox is that conventional movie flaws don't detract from this film. Some events are boring, some characters exaggerated, some situations underdeveloped. But these are real life occurrences. Based on a true story, Steel Magnolias blooms with authenticity. Unlike a documentary, we're spared the technical medical details, and we're given no answers to the psychological, philosophical, and theological quandaries posed. Leave that to medical journals or Bible classes.What we're offered by Shelby is a model for life. At the point she has her beautiful flowing hair cut short to make things ""simple"", you know something really bad is afoot. Rather than feel sorry for herself, she faces what life offers and makes the best of it. Ironically, as a diabetic, she's the sweetest person. Slowly but surely, the others discover that if you cheat a bit by not eating the right food, by not praying enough, or by letting your hair down socially, you'll fare better in this short tough life. Most importantly, support your fellow human beings and they'll support you.So you see, my title is appropriately cute, inasmuch as Steel Magnolias serves everybody, including diabetics, a sweet treat!",Steel Magnolias

I would love to have the part played by Tom Skerritt as (Drum). Out side scaring the birds away by firing his pistol and then with his crossbow was really funny. The sparing he does with Shirly (Ouiser) will make you chuckle out-loud. Really great acting by everyone in the cast. So why am I down on this movie? Too much pain. After having watched a really good light comedy I'm suddenly watching Julia (Shelby) fighting for her life for a long time. Too much pain. Then the funeral and grave yard scene that wouldn't end was too much for me. The only part of the grave-yard scene that made me not hurt so much was when Annelle said it should be a celebration as Shelby was going to see her King.

70,giffey-1,Add me to the list of men who like this film!,8,8 September 2006,"Like other reviewers have said, this film is in my personal collection and I love it. This story of a group of women and their relationships with each other and the others in their lives as portrayed through the seasons of Nachitoches, Louisiana is like chicken soup - familiar, nourishing, and always there when you want to reconnect. It starts with getting ready for a wedding at Easter. Actually, it starts with a newcomer to town (Anelle, brilliantly played by Darryl Hannah) getting a new job at the most successful beauty shop in town. Truvy's (played by Dolly Parton, giving her best performance) has become the gathering place for the group of women this movie will focus on. Meanwhile, at the Eatenton household, M'Lynn (Sally Field) is preparing for her daughter Shelby's (Julia Roberts) wedding. We meet this family and then get to see the next door neighbor, Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine) crossing swords with M'Lynn's husband, Drum. Back at Truvy's we also get to meet the former First Lady of Chinquipin Parish, Claree (Olympia Dukaukis). The story unfolds through Shelby's wedding and our discovery that she is a diabetic which will create problems later on, to the Christmas Festival, to a summer Independence day where we learn Shelby has had a baby boy, and see what having that baby has done to Shelby's health, to a Hallowwe'en that starts well but ends in a tragedy, to Eater again and the rebirth of the circle of life. The stories range from hysterical to touching and the interplay and dialog of the actresses are wonderful. My personal favorite funny part is Ouiser unknowingly walking into Truvy's during a discussion of how to tell if a man is gay (I still laugh till I cry during that scene). How are the performances? Sally Field as the matriarch of the Eatenton family is a tower of strength, and then shows her strength through tragedy. This is Julia Roberts' finest performance ever, the most natural and genuine part she has played. (If you were wondering, I hate Pretty Woman) Just watch the scene at Christmastime between Sally and Julia and you will understand. Dolly Parton gives a performance instead of playing Dolly, and she may be my favorite character. I have read people say they felt Shirley MacLaine overplayed Ouiser, but I understand it. Ouiser is a larger than life character and is well served by Shirley. I have never been much of a fan of Darryl Hannah until I saw this movie. I thought she brought life to what could have been a cardboard character. Olympia Dukaukis is great as Claree, showing that life needn't end because you are a widow. I think of these women as friends and regularly enjoy seeing them when I watch this wonderful film.",Steel Magnolias

72,trixie30,"Sappy and predictable story, but some good actresses",6,9 March 2019,"I've seen this twice now because my daughter wanted to watch it again and I am a bit of a softy where she is concerned. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'd just as soon not watch it again. It bored me half the time and I rolled my eyes frequently. I've heard it's going to be re-released in theaters. You'd have to pay me a boatload of money to watch it on the big screen.I've seen a number of reviews where Shelby is called selfish for having a baby when she knew it would probably kill her. And she is. I admit I haven't read every review, but I haven't read much about Jackson's selfishness. Despite saying he understood and that they could adopt, he must have made Shelby's life miserable. He obviously wasn't okay with adopting and is shown as the kind of man who feels less a man or that she doesn't love him enough if his wife won't have his baby.When Shelby says that having the baby will ""help"" her marriage, you can't help but understand that Jackson is as much to blame. He is as selfish as she is. Did he nag and guilt her into it? Did he say the doctors don't know and that things would be fine? Did he threaten to leave? Those are the things the viewer will never know, so the blame goes solely to Shelby. I look at him and see an immature, self-centered jerk.Representations where men are made to appear foolish and/or weak in order to show women as strong make me crazy! My southern grandmother would have been incensed because (1) southern women (most women in general, for that matter) are strong regardless; (2) they (again, like most women) admire strong, but considerate men; and (3) are insulted both for themselves and men when writers build women up by shoving men down . They'd never be fine married to the spineless or selfish or both supposedly ""quirky"" caricatures portrayed here. I know no women who would--and most of them aren't from the south.I do like most of the cast and think the women do a very good job with the characters. They're well suited to the parts. I'm not and have never been a huge Julia Roberts fan, but she's tolerable. She does an excellent job with the hypoglycemic scene. I have reactive hypoglycemia and have been there. It's been decades since I messed up enough to go toward hypoglycemic shock, but I remember descending into it a few times before I was diagnosed. It really is that terrifying to the person it's happening to and to the people around them. (And yes, juice is better than candy. But why on earth didn't she have glucose tablets on hand?)I'm not sure why this is so highly hyped as a great movie. Clearly some people love it and don't see it as flawed. Different strokes and all that.",Steel Magnolias

74,moviebuffgirl,"Dramatic MASTERPIECE, Nearly perfect (cinematography is forgettable)",9,28 July 2001,"This is one of the most fantastic dramatic movies I have ever seen. The way it gives voice to the fierce and loving bond between women, the love and anger between mothers and the daughters they cherish, the humor and spice of southern life, is simply SUPERB. The script is one of the finest I have ever seen brought to screen. Funny, sad, real, natural and yet more condensed into the essence of meaning. The whole movie is infinately quotable.  But warning: you must be willing to cry because it is one of the most tragically beautiful character-driven movies I have ever seen.The story of a group of small-town southern women who are tied together by their honest understanding of each other's flaws, their shared sense of the absurd, their fundamental goodness, and their fierce love for one another. It is a story of a luminous and charming young woman, named Shelby (played by an impossibly beautiful young Julia Roberts--who got the part on her dramatic talents alone, the casting directer considered her freakish-looking or at least ""not at all pretty enough to play Shelby"") who marries the man she loves (an unarguably handsome young Dylan McDermott). Shelby is loving and loved and wants nothing more than to have a child, a simple enough desire for some but considerably more of a challenge for Shelby, who has an extremely weak body and severe diabetes.Although not explicitly referred to in the movie, Steel Magnolias seem to be the southern women themselves-- both beautiful and resilient. These are women who have grown up together, their lives and personalities intertwined.
The cast is pitch-perfect and uniformly superb. Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton and Shirley McClain are FANTASTIC-- embodying their flawed and loveable characters with fiery warmth. The luminaries are too many to list-- both Julia Roberts and Sally Field deserved oscars, and I am usually a harsh critic of both of them. (Field is frequently too 'cutesy' for my taste and her eyebrows quivver like a hound dog, and although I think Roberts has talent she has frequently made nearly unforgiveably poor choices such as Runaway Bride, Pretty Woman, Conspiracy Theory and the like). However, both Field and Roberts are simply OUTSTANDING. If this movie doesn't make you weep, you should get your tear-ducts examined.My only criticism, (and as someone who really really loves the art of film, this is a biggie) is that the cinematography is forgettable. In terms of setting dramatic mood it does a good job of pretending to let you eavesdrop on key moments. It is not intrusive. But in a movie of this dramatic scope, there were times when I wished the camera gave a more intimate angle, peered into people's faces and followed their gestures or symbolic details. In other words, the literary or artistic dimension of the way the film was put together seemd somewhat flat to me. This was the ONLY thing that detracted from what was otherwise one of the most moving and well-done dramas I have ever seen.",Steel Magnolias

Yes it's manipulative and over zealous and overacted. However, and this is a big deal to me, it's like coming home to a house full of family with a roaring fire, food in the oven and laughter to be shared. It's warm, fuzzy and has hysterical one liners. The female actresses are all superb.

The performances are superb and the emotional range of these women is incredible. I rarely laugh out loud when I'm watching a DVD alone at home but this movie had me laughing out loud and for so long my sides were sore and I had tears rolling down my face and this happens every time I see this film. And at the other extreme, Sally Field's performance throughout was wonderful but her portrayal of the insanity of such loss and grief in the scene at the cemetery is gut wrenching and explores the whole insane range of emotions that are experienced with such profound grief. I was sobbing and even after repeated viewings - I do watch movies that I really like several times over a period of weeks or months and even years - her portrayal of this grieving mother has me first crying and then laughing every time I watch it.The lifelong bonds between these women are wonderful in their depth and complexity and their acceptance of each others idiosyncrasies that are so well portrayed by these amazing actresses is heartwarming and funny and very real. These women portray friendship at its best.I highly recommend this film, chick flick or not, it's fun and funny and gut wrenching and heartwarming. I laughed until I cried until I laughed again.Why at least some of these women did not receive Academy Awards for their brilliant performances of this amazing script, I'll never understand.I must also give high praise to the use of silence in this film. So many moments are given such importance and impact by the use of silence especially those very long moments in the hospital around 'the decision' spoke volumes.I do hope it is not possible to wear out a DVD because I might just watch it enough to wear it out!",Steel Magnolias

Nobody could have played her the way Daryl did.Julia Roberts as Shelby this is probably my favorite character she's ever played. Her relationship with M'Lynn was just wonderful. I also love how all the women just loved Shelby.Shirley MacLaine as Ouisa just wow. Shirley can play anything but mean old Ouisa is her best.Country singer Dolly Parton as the hairstylist Truvy was perfect.

These characters do not seem like real women at all...they exist in some bizarre netherworld between seventies TV sitcom and pure camp. Easily the worst offender has to be Shirley Maclaine, absolutely embarrassing and unwatchable. It's as if she's doing an imitation of the old Ruth Buzzi spinster with a purse routine on Laugh-In. It's an excruciating performance. The movie is poorly written, with Southern clichés in abundance, and that sort of fake life-affirming friendship-conquers-all ending straight out of a TV Disease Movie of the Week. The one bright spot in this muck is the acting of Julia Roberts in an early role; before she was effectively branded as America's Smiling Sweetheart, there was a sweet, natural charm to her.

It is special, however, because of when and where I saw it and the circumstances that surround the first viewing of it! I was at UCLA at the time and we always got film premieres before the theatres and sometimes they would invite actors/actresses after the showings! After we saw it, they said, we have the ""great, up and coming actress you all just saw"" and it was Julia Roberts. She was there to answer any questions we had. First of all, no one went to the mic to ask questions, then she said, ""Come on guys, I flew in from Dallas for this!"" Then everybody got up and went to the mic to ask questions.Most were basic questions but it's funny looking back today at some of those questions, like ""What movies are next for you?"" She replied, ""I've finished a comedy called 'Pretty Woman' , which I hope people will like and I'm beginning work on a film called 'Flatliners' next week."" She was friendly, affable and very kind to us all, long before she became the superstar she is today!

It was just far too predictable--you know what's going to happen before it does. The whole story centers around a bunch of crazy Southern women and their banter sounds like the clucking of chickens with Louisiana accents. Also, I get so sick of listening to Julia Roberts go on and on about how much she wants a baby, despite the fact that it'll kill her. Brilliant...sacrifice your husband's love and break your mother's heart just to get pregnant. The lines were clichéd and sappy and made me want to bang my head on a wall.

The performances are all great, and I love Julia Roberts in this, so natural and effervescent (I think she's getting too Hollywood now). This is a movie about the characters, that sounds stupid-probably is- but every one of them is so engaging, each story gets you- you even feel for the grumpy ones! I love movies where you don't have to think too deeply whilst the emotions speak for themselves. I'm not saying this is mindless and inane, on the contrary it's the definition of 'touching'! It's a very well portrayed, natural and realistic insight into the lives of a group seemingly ordinary women- behind the obvious differences and conflicts, the relationships and situations are complex. Just looking at the women in my family confirms this; the discord runs deep, but the loyalty runs deeper. This is the original home-town girl movie; bring the tissues, bring it on!",Steel Magnolias

This movie should be viewed for Sally Field's performance towards the end of the movie - truly one of the best pieces of acting I've ever seen.  And who can forget Shirly MacLaine's hilarious performance?  This is not a prestigious film, it is just a fine piece of entertainment that does not try to live up to Hollywood norms.

84,bobbadger-1,Oscar worthy?,10,26 July 2008,"The repartee between Dukakis and Maclaine rivals any bit that Abbott and Costello ever created. The diabetic crisis scene that Roberts pulled off was as physically accurate as anything ever seen outside an actual emergency room. Hannah's religious fanaticism was as annoying as that which I find in real life here in the ""Bible belt,"" but her soliloquy to Fields after the funeral about the ""why"" of Shelby's death redeemed her character forever in my heart. Parton's ""down-home"" humor and willingness to help anyone who needed her help was ""spot-on"". I married her (or somebody quite like that character) and remain quite ready to spend my life with her. My opinion is that Parton's line about there being no such thing as ""natural beauty"" is one of the most salient lines in the script. What would happen if we could see ""on the inside"" as easily? That's what this story is all about.But the scene that hasn't been discussed nearly enough in this forum is when M'Lynn shows up at Aunt Fern's after Shelby's death to pick up Little Jack Junior. The way she held, cuddled and caressed that little boy was an act of everlasting love for him and for his now dead mother. It showed more in her gestures than in her face, but there was no question that she cherished that little boy and the memories he represented. Maybe she wasn't acting.The rest of Fields' performance had several ""supernovas"" in it as well. Her obvious disapproval of Shelby's decision to have a child despite the risks to her own health is one example. THAT scene DID show in her face as well as in her gestures. The language of her ""WHY?"" lament at the cemetery at ""Shelby's"" funeral was written to evoke that kind of emotion and Fields delivered! No criticism of Roberts' performance, but, if only one Oscar nomination was available, maybe we ought to put Sally Fields on a pedestal of some sort so that she can be seen on a par with the statuesque Julia Roberts.Finally, for those who have commented that the male characters were ""wasted"",... Pah! ""Steel Magnolias"" wasn't about the male characters. Skerritt, Shepard and the other male actors were effective in their roles and should be congratulated for being strong enough to stay out of the way of the juggernaut that was the ""Steel Magnolias."" Go watch Conan or Dirty Harry if you need a macho flick, but you would be advised to stay clear of Dukakis and Maclaine.

They all feel like caricatures made from the same mold: They all think about marriage (failed ones, future ones, fake ones), babies and/or gossip. We never get to know enough about them to understand why they are even friends or if they can act any other way than *cutesy-gossipy* or teary-eyed. Even so, we are led to believe that the characters' interactions are supposedly showing genuine female friendship, which I feel personally insulted by. All the women seem to do is complain about the men in their lives or talk about family-planning.
I do get that this is playing in the 80s, and sentimentalities were different then. I don't have to like the film and its implicit message, though. Even in the 80s, women talked about more interesting things, and had higher aspirations and more authentic female friendships than what we see in this film.
So, I hate it and I'm not sorry to say so. After all, the director doesn't seem care about how insulting his story actually is. People will come for the cast of big names and stay for the heavy-handed, sentimental kitsch. As long as they pay, who cares if the film is contrived, emotionally manipulative garbage?Note: the 2 stars are for the delightful costumes and the pretty scenery.

While the movie follows most of the play, some of the things added in are brilliant (i.e.- the wedding scene was not included in the play, but some of my favorite parts of the movie were during that scene).

94,sandyonmovies,The saddest movie that'll make you laugh.,8,12 March 2013,"There are a couple reasons why everyone should watch this movie.First, Steel Magnolias is led by a strong female cast whose snappy and comedic dialogue are enjoyable to watch. Their performances are so raw and believable that it's a shock to learn that only Julia Roberts was nominated for an Oscar.The supporting cast is full of wonderful characters from Dolly Parton (Truvy) (she's so cute!), Olympia Dukakis (Clairee) and Shirley McLaine. McLaine was my favorite as Ouiser, a sarcastic, grouchy, two-time widow. Daryl Hannah was the one weak point within the tight group. Hannah's performance was spot on, but I found her character exhausting and annoying at times. Roberts was lovable as Field's daughter Shelby, whose Type One Diabetes casts a somber cloud over the otherwise cheerful movie.Second, the story is adapted from the play written by Robert Harling (The First Wives' Club). Harling's inspiration for the story came from his own tragic real-life experiences of dealing with his sister's sickness and eventual death.Third, Sally Field. Field is fantastic as Robert's strong and overprotective mother, M'Lynn. Field's monologue at the end gave me the chills, it was perfect representation of what M'Lynn was going through. It's enough just to watch the movie for that one scene. I have not seen many of her movies so I didn't realize how incredibly talented she is. I really really like her, I really do.Throughout the movie, I got confused with the time jumps and what was going on during some scenes. Sometimes the next scene jumps ahead a couple of years and I wouldn't realize it until the next scene. Other than that issue, I really have no complaints. The cinematography, hairstyling (the southern big puffy hair), and the acting by everyone (even the men) was perfect for this chick flick.A heartwarming and charming tearjerker, Steel Magnolias is a movie that everyone has to see at least once. Highly recommended. 8 out 10.",Steel Magnolias

The thing I always wondered, that Shelby always hung out with her mother and her friends. Didn't she have any friends of her own? Were there any other people who went to Truvy's beauty parlor? I thought 6 women were great in the movie. I thought Drum was funny, but Jackson, Shelby's husband was a bit annoying. I thought Truvy was warm, funny, friendly. I wish all beauticians would be like her. The first time I saw this movie was in 1991. I wanted to see it because Julia Roberts was in it and I loved her in Pretty Woman and Sleeping With The Enemy. Of all the Sally Field movies I've seen, I liked her best in Steel Magnolias. Another good thing about the movie is that the characters really decorated the houses for all holidays such as Easter, Christmas and the 4th of July.

100,zimmedc,Come and Listen to My Story 'bout a Gal Named Shel(by),4,3 August 2005,"We took a weekend trip from Baton Rouge, LA to Natchitoches, LA, where fifteen years earlier the filming of Steel Magnolias in 1989 remains about the biggest thing that ever happened. Having never seen the movie, we rented it as soon as we got back home. Everyone had a reason for watching it in two segments--mine was my sense that this was one of the ""cutest"" movies I'd ever seen, and I'd had quite enough ""cute"" lately, especially after sitting through Will Smith in ""Hitch"". The accents and the caricatures of the characters were all so thick that it reminded me of The Beverly Hillbillies, though more embarrassing than funny. One ""Hillbillies-like"" moment that pretty funny was the few non-female characters' effort to shoot some ""crows"" out of a tree so that they won't ""sh*t all over the reception"". Their creative use of a crossbow is a classic.Sad to say there isn't much else classic in a story that is at the same time saccharine and maudlin. I saw another review that noted the choppiness of some scenes (as the movie was adapted from a play that never left the beauty shop). I can think of two scenes in particular--one where the town-big wig Clairee (played by the noted-Southern belle Olympia Dukasis) buys the local radio station so that she can do the color commentary on the local football games (the scene features the same guy filmed bare from the back waist-and-lower view as he walks in front camera in the locker room three times.) In another scene, the Darryl Hannah (hard to recognize) committed Christian character argues with her boyfriend over his repeated taking of the Lord's name in vain. Neither scene has any impact on the rest of the story.Dolly Parton is her usual big hair, big smile, big **** self as the lead hairdresser. Shirley MacLaine has a very unsympathetic character as the Eatonton's (Julie and Sally, and family) ill-tempered neighbor. The male characters are more or less wasted, especially the estimable Sam Shepard, who spends most of the film underneath a car, or sitting lifelessly in front of a TV.The movie moved up from a 2 during the seemingly endless wedding prep and wedding of the first half to a 6 in the second half, which became more dramatic. Sally Field has a pretty good scene near the end, she and the story make you think a little about the motives of the main character (Julia Roberts as Shelby).Overall, I thought that Steel Magnolias was a relatively embarrassing depiction of life in the beautiful town of Natchitoches, LA. Given that the locals seemed not to mind too much, I may be overreacting. They even showed us where the truck made an illegal left turn in the final scene. I hope this is not a spoiler.I don't really understand the almost universal overwhelming praise by the reviewers here. I understand the overall rating under 7, as all the 10's from the reviewers are being offset by 4's and 5's by people who saw the movie as I did, but were too nice to submit a comment.",Steel Magnolias

The end of the movie is definately heart wrenching but the scene in the cemetery where Sally Fields ""let's loose"" is wonderful, I too have felt that kind of anger over a death, and it was nice to see the ""town grump"" Shirley McLain express a different emotion over M'Lynn's loss instead of being cold and sarcastic as she is in the rest of the film.

When people wore more genuine masks. When people didn't have fancy dreams of becoming billionaires with material wealth and disregard the rest. When people valued families, relationships more. You feel more secure and connected because of the community.Something happened in the past 30 years, and we no longer have all of these. This movie tells us what's really important in life and what's lost.",Steel Magnolias
104,elliestratton,A Classic,10,15 February 2007,"This movie is a real classic. Everyone in the film from Shirley MacLaine, Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Olympia Dukakis, Dolly Parton, Daryl Hannah, they are all so good. The scene that always makes me cry is the ""Why"" scene with Sally Field after she loses her daughter. She gives a heart-wrenching monolgoue about why things have gone so wrong. It is an unbelievable performance. I think it's funny that guys call these films ""Chick Flicks"" when these films have some of the best acting and writing you can get. Also, Shirley as Weezer is a dropdead funny performance. I didn't know this film was based on a true story. When I watch it it always reminds me of my family.",Steel Magnolias
105,jamies_06,Comedy and Tragedy,9,28 July 2009,"The setting of ""Steel Magnolias"" is in a small town Louisiana. The movie mainly takes place in a beauty parlor owned by Truvy (Dolly Parton). Some of Truvy's regular clients like to come into the parlor to gossip, just like women from the South. Truvy does Shelby's (Julia Roberts) hair on the day of her wedding, making her look so beautiful that it causes Shelby to almost faint, but really she almost faints because of her diabetes, so they give her a glass of orange juice to make her feel better. Truvy hired a woman, Annelle (Daryl Hannah), to do M'Lynn's (Sally Field) hair. M'Lynn is also Shelby's mother. There are also two other women waiting at the beauty parlor to get their hair done. Ouiser (Shirley MacLaine) who is the wealthiest/meanest women in Louisiana and Clairee (Olympia Dukakis) who is a nice widowed women. All of these six women become very good friends throughout this movie. They have obstacles to face, for example, a major event that happens is that Shelby has diabetes and then gets pregnant which M'Lynn objects to because it can cause major problems to her body. It causes one of Shelby's kidney's to fail. So M'Lynn gives Shelby one of hers, but in the end it doesn't turn out good. Throughout this movie no matter what happens, the women all stick together and help each other through hard times.""Steel Magnolia's"" was released on November 15, 1989 and directed by Herbert Ross. This movie is about six women who become best friends who have times of happiness and sadness. The women make funny jokes and laugh with each other, but when something terrible happens they are always there for each other to make each other feel better.The reason I like the movie ""Steel Magnolias"" so much, is because it is such a good movie that makes me laugh, but at the same time makes me cry. I believe that ""Steel Magnolias"" fits the title just right. The women are tough like steel, so they can face any obstacle that comes there way, but as gentle as a magnolia flower.",Steel Magnolias
106,DBowik,The single best seen ever by an actress...Sally Field,10,16 February 2003,"This is a great movie all around. How about the cast?! I don't know if there has ever been or will ever be a cast this talented in one movie again! I can understand why some people might say it is ""sappy"" or too ""feminine"", but hey..that is what they are going for here, so why not enjoy it. The movie is great, a definitel 10 in my book. However, I think that the movie also contains the best scene of acting by any man or women in the history of film. Sally Field at her daughters funeral goes through an entire range of emotions in just 3 minutes! For anyone that has ever lost a loved one, and is so distraught that you don't know how to act or feel...Ms Field delivers those feelings flat out on the screen better than anyone I have every seen. This is the movie that made me believe that Sally Field is the best actor in the world today!",Steel Magnolias
107,HoneyBunny2004,This film is a definite must-see!,8,14 January 2005,"This film is sad, funny and sweet all in one go. I would highly recommend this film to everyone and anyone.I have never laughed and cried at a film at basically the same time.The main characters act fantastically, especially Julia Roberts. Ousier is a wonderfully spiteful character, she made me love to hate her, with her witty comments, sarcasm and pessimism, although she did reveal a slightly more caring side at some times!I was very shocked when i learnt that this was a true story. The parish is so close and friendly, that it made me feel all of their their sadness and joy. I felt that i knew these people personally, by the end of the film.I would definitely class this film as one of my favourites and i'm sure you'll see why, if you see it!! It is excellent and perfect in nearly every way!",Steel Magnolias
108,cblackburn-866-397893,Best movie for role models,8,9 December 2013,"The greatest thing about Steel Magnolias is how dominated the plot is by female characters. Granted that is one of the basic reasons for the title, but it's true. The plot line includes the death of a central character which is powerful but tricky. When deciding to remove a central character for a dramatic point in the plot, you first have to give the audience an opportunity to establish a relationship with that character. This movie successfully does that so that her death causes a major sense of tragedy for the audience. In the process, the film tells a story about the infamously tough southern women. It portrays women in a real-life superhero type of role which is something that doesn't happen nearly enough on screen.",Steel Magnolias
109,redneck-2,A masterpiece of writing and acting.,10,9 July 1999,"This is one of the best character-driven films ever made.  The writing is excellent--if Robert Harling does nothing else the rest of his life, this semi-biographical play/film will sustain his reputation.  Being from the South, and north Louisiana in particular, I feel qualified to comment on the authenticity of the characters.  Watching this movie is like visiting old friends or going to a family reunion.  The best part of the film, for me at least, is not the drama around which the storyline is based ( Julia Roberts' character, Shelby, is a diabetic who has a child against the advice of doctors, ultimately causing serious problems for her state of health), but rather the witty barbs and delicious asides that the women throw at each other and anyone else within firing distance.  Perhaps the best line of the movie can be attributed to Olympia Dukakis' character, Clairee, who says, ""Like I always say, if you can't say something nice about somebody---come sit by me!""  The most moving scene of the movie, however, does fall into the drama category.  Sally Field gives the performance of her career as a destroyed mother close to the end of the film.  I'm not ashamed to admit that, even though I've seen this film probably more than twenty times, her performance brings tears to my eyes and a lump to my throat every time I watch it.  I dare any guy to watch this movie and not get choked up--if you can, you don't have a heart!  All in all, though, the melodrama is balanced very well with the humor, which, along with the performances of an outstanding cast (not one of which gives less than an excellent performance), makes for one hell of a movie!",Steel Magnolias
110,ctatum,A Circle of Life,10,5 February 2000,"It wasnt until several years after I first saw this movie that I truly understood what this movie meant. It begins with a wedding at Easter, a symbol of new life on a Christian holiday celebrating the new life given by the resurrection of Christ. We learn that Shelby is pregnant at Christmas, a Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Christ. Shelby dies and Annelle's child is born when Easter comes again. The symbolism is so subtle and complete, the story so well laid out, and the characters so carefully depicted and developed. This film is a must-see for serious film-goers.",Steel Magnolias

I can't count how many times I have watched it (first time in theatre) and even though I own the video I continue to watch it when appearing on TV.  Absolutely love Olympia Dukakis and Shirley McLaine.  And Drum Eatonton is not that different from some men we all know!

I just love all the characters and the story. Whether feeling ill,laying on the couch or, just knowing it's time for a good movie. It's always there to fill that void. When the DVD was released.. Well, my heart just skipped a beat.. Julia Roberts as Shelby is the best.. and Dolly as Truvy.. No one else could have played those parts... Olympia and Shirley play off each other so well it's amazing. Daryl's character Annelle changes personality so many times it's surprising that she didn't need therapy herself after the shooting was over and Sally Field should have at least received another Oscar nomination for her performance as M'Lynn..

116,edwardhopper,Chronology confusions...,8,27 October 2006,"I really enjoy watching this movie for so many reasons, but here's a nagging question: Is anyone else confused about the timing of Annelle's pregnancy? My mother and I have obsessed about this for years, and we chase around and around and never solve it.The movie starts at Easter time, let's say in 1980. At Christmas 1980, Shelby announces her pregnancy. Jack Jr. is ""born on the 3rd of July"", 1981, and his 1st birthday is celebrated in the movie in July 1982, in the days before Shelby's kidney transplant. Annelle is not visibly pregnant when she comes running out with the pot of beans for Shelby's family. Then Shelby has her rejection scene at Halloween, when Annelle has her wedding shower (we can't see her well enough to know if she's already visibly pregnant); Jack looks like he's no more than 15 months old, so it's probably still 1982. At Shelby's funeral, it's autumn and Annelle suddenly looks pregnant and talks about the baby (she'd be 3-4 months along at this point), and Jack Jr. still looks really little when M'Lynn picks him up from Aunt Fern's. Annelle's baby is then born at Easter time, at most 6 months after the funeral; in those final scenes, Jack Jr. looks a LOT older than 22 months, which is what he would have to be at that point. I think in the credits it even refers to him as ""Jack Jr. (age 3)"" or something.So, one of two things could be true: A. Shelby stayed in her coma for an entire year and died at Halloween in 1983, and Annelle's baby was born at Easter in 1984, in which case Jack Jr. should have been a lot bigger when M'Lynn went to pick him up but would fit his appearance in the final Easter scene.OR B. Annelle was already pregnant when she got married. Given that she was so religious that she wouldn't let Sammy keep beer in the fridge and got really embarrassed over the kinky underwear from Ouiser, I have a hard time believing that. It's also not as if seriously religious people don't get pregnant before getting married, but it is not really consistent with her character, and they don't say anything about it, leading me to believe that it was just an oversight.Clearly I've thought about this more than the people who made the movie, which is to say I've thought about it way too much! The movie is not about Annelle, so it doesn't really matter, but the inconsistencies bugged me.I saw the stage play, and I don't think Annelle even gets pregnant in that script, so no resolution there. Any theories?",Steel Magnolias
117,gaming_geologist,A beautiful film despite its flaws,8,26 March 2007,"This is without a doubt one of my favorite films of all time--and I dare say the only ""chick flick"" that I truly enjoy. Steel Magnolias had an even mix of drama and comedy, all interlaced with the theme of friendship and love. The acting was beautiful, and each of the six leading ladies had their shining moments (*brief spoiler* particularly Sally Field in the cemetery scene after the funeral*, not to mention the periodic humorous exchanges between Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine and Daryl Hannah's changing personality throughout the course of the movie).Granted, this film does have its flaws. Cinematography was so-so, and there were plenty of continuity errors. Olympia Dukakis's accent sounded ridiculously forced at times, and Julia Roberts's accent faded in and out. Overall, though, the movie's good qualities far outweighed the bad, and I highly recommend Steel Magnolias to anyone who needs a good laugh...as well as a good cry.",Steel Magnolias

Of course, Dolly Parton is my favourite, but credit must be given to Julia Roberts and Sally Field for their magnetic attraction as mother and daughter.

123,krbroussa,The REAL Louisiana,10,23 March 2005,"As a native of Louisiana, may I clarify some aspects of this wonderful movie? First, there is neither a parish (what we call counties in Louisiana) nor a town in Louisiana named Chinquapin. This is totally fictional. Chinquapin is what we call a red-eared sunfish and is also a type of oak tree. The movie was filmed in Natchitoches, Louisiana, which is in Natchitoches parish. I attended Northwestern State University in Natchitoches. Natchitoches is in the northwestern part of Louisiana where the people speak a southern dialect, not a South Louisiana, or Cajun, dialect. Althougth there are French names in Natchitoches and wonderful Louisiana food, this town where the movie takes place, is not in Cajun Louisiana. Anyone in Natchitoches who speaks with a Cajun accent has moved there from South Louisiana. The movie is very authentic to the lifestyle and people of Natchitoches at the time it was filmed. Please remember that all of Louisiana is NOT Cajun. Only the southern part of the state is the Cajun area and not everyone in Louisiana of French descent is Cajun. If you would like to really understand the true meaning of Cajun, please do an Internet search under ""Cajun"" or ""Acadien.""",Steel Magnolias

The Actors and Actresses they had mixed well together and I must say they all did a fantastic job. Dolly Parton steals the show though with her country voice and that awesome laugh. Also, Sally Fields and Julia Roberts make the greatest mother daughter combo ever to star on film. Shirley Maclaine had a very crude mouth, but she was always truthful which in turn helped her to be liked in the end.
