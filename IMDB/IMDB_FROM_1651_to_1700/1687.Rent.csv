0,TheLittleSongbird,"A solid musical adaptation, a few foibles here and there but when it's good it's great",7,1 June 2014,"Not the best film musical in the world but a long way from the worst. Is it as good as the stage show? Not quite, then again that is always a big ask, any musical deserves to stand on its own two feet and Rent certainly does that. Is it perfect? No, some of the last third does feel rushed, the direction in a couple of the musical numbers does have a slightly overblown music video quality that didn't fit with the rest and Benny's part is reduced so much to the point of being a caricature and he did seem too much of a plot device. Is it good? Yes it definitely is, its best parts are actually great. On the most part it does look good, the costumes, lighting and sets are appropriately colourful and gritty, perfectly matching the atmosphere and story and the photography is mostly fine. The choreography has so much energy to the extent that in the upbeat numbers(especially La Vie Boheme) you're tapping your toes, Chris Columbus's direction is more than competent(at least he gives off the feeling that he had a good idea how to direct a musical, which is more than I can say for for example Richard Attenborough for A Chorus Line and Sidney Lumet for The Wiz, to me Annie gets too much undeserved hate) and the script is written amusingly at times, but mostly in a way that really resonates with the audiences emotionally. Not everybody likes the story in Rent, but to me it does have shock value(if not as much as in the late 80s-early 90s) that is portrayed in a harrowing and heart-wrenching way. As an adaptation there is some tinkering like a few song cuts but I found it fairly faithful in spirit to the stage show. But the best component of Rent is easily the score, which is nothing short of brilliant. Sure it has songs that are better than others, then again that is common in musicals, but all range to uplifting to heartfelt, there is lots of energy but also a fair share of pathos. The performances are equally terrific, their characters are not as well fleshed out as the stage show but the cast look comfortable and do a good job in still making them believable.Jesse L Martin's character has the most compelling story arc, and Martin sounds great and delivers with great emotion and spirit, it is very different to his role on Law and Order which is testament to how talented and versatile Martin is. Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms are similarly great for similar reasons to Martin(Heredia also benefits from being a great dancer), and Rosario Dawson is heart-breaking especially in the latter part of the film. Adam Pascal is ever so slightly stiff in places but is incredibly emotive and his vocals don't disappoint either and Idina Menzel looks as though she is having so much fun even though Maureen is not very well developed here and her vocals are powerhouse quality. Taye Diggs is disadvantaged by what is done to Benny but does his best and is hardly a liability. In conclusion, solid stuff that could have been better. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Rent
1,SnoopyStyle,Broadway musical movie,6,19 May 2016,"It's Christmas Eve, 1989 New York East Village. Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp) is an aspiring documentary filmmaker. His roommate Roger Davis (Adam Pascal) was a rock star but is now withdrawn, recovering-addict, and suffering from AIDS. Their former friend Benjamin Coffin III (Taye Diggs) married rich. He is trying to evict everybody and redeveloping the building. Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel) has dumped Mark for new girlfriend Joanne Jefferson (Tracie Thoms) and organizing a rally against the evictions. Mimi Marquez (Rosario Dawson) is a burlesque dancer who falls for Roger but he is still struggling with many issues. Transvestite Angel Dumott Schunard (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) finds Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) beaten up in an alley. They are both afflicted with AIDS.This is transferred from Broadway. As a musical, some of songs rock but most are forgettable. As a movie and as a story, this is kind of soapy. The characters feel very written. I see the characters rather as a take it or leave it proposition. I never got swept up in any of their stories but it is able to hold together. The actors are all solid. It is probably not my kind of material anyways.",Rent
2,kosmasp,Shallow but still ...,8,25 April 2007,"You might have read or already knew that this is a screen adaptation from a Broadway musical. But you might not have seen the musical play yet (I know I didn't). So I can only review it from a musical play free point of view! The cast is thrown together from the original players (from the musical play that is) plus Rosario Dawson, who's new to this. The musical numbers change genre, from Rock to Pop, giving further insight into the emotional turmoil of the characters. All in all, there is not much story and I shouldn't have given it so much stars ... but the title song is so good (imo), that I'd give the movie 10/10 just for that song (Seasons of Love) ... I know it's crazy, but I just love it, can't help it! :o) (the song is also played in the trailer, if you want to listen to it first!)",Rent
3,gavin6942,I'm Glad I Don't Own This Movie... I Only Rented It,4,28 June 2006,"I see the majority of people ranked this film a ""10""... and I have no idea why. I love musicals, but this film was painful to watch.The story is a group of bohemians living in an apartment who don't pay their rent and are dying from AIDS. Besides the main character, played by the kid from Chris Columbus' ""Adventures in Babysitting"", who is normal in every way (unless you consider being Jewish a disadvantage). It's basically an updated version of ""La Boheme"" (where the disease was tuberculosis).I liked a few songs, but overall the songs were very lyrically weak and musically uninspired. The songs seemed to depends too heavily on rehashing lyrics from earlier songs and using the same catch phrases (such as ""no day but today"") over and over again. And while I understand the importance keeping a flow and theme, it just seemed overdone. The songs I liked were ""Tango Maureen"", ""Today For You, Tomorrow For Me"" and ""La Vie Boheme"" (this last one mostly because it shocked me).Adam Pascal, who is excellent in ""Little Shop of Horrors"", is awful in this film as Roger, the Bon Jovi wannabe. His songs aren't any good (not his fault) and he adds nothing to them. His character was by far the most disappointing.Chris Columbus, the director, continued his mediocrity with this film. No scene stood out as memorable (except a few seconds in the beginning where the actors are -- for no reason -- burning and throwing away their only heat source), nothing special made him the obvious choice. I guess he was called by Anthony Rapp (the ""Adventures in Babysitting"" kid) or something. The obvious choice, actually, would have been Baz Luhrmann, who has directed ""La Boheme"" before and adapted it into ""Moulin Rouge"", which frankly is the vastly superior film.In short, see ""Moulin Rouge"" and don't waste your time on this trash.",Rent
4,edwagreen,Rent-Break the Lease on this One *1/2,3,30 August 2006,"In a musical, the music is supposed to lead the story on. That is the major handicap with ""Rent.""The plot is supposedly given to us in the first scene. So as to avoid an eviction, a group should discourage a demonstration.The story of renting in New York City with all its problems would have made for an interesting film. Instead, we go away from that and instead we have a musical folly full of catchy tunes such as the tango sequence-where one person lived this dance from an ambassador and the other from a Jewish Community Center!The Aids epidemic is done in song which wasn't that thrilling. To me, the film became more of a collage of musical numbers. The choreography is appealing but lets make sense of the story line.",Rent
5,wes-connors,A Year in the Life,6,28 February 2010,"""Set in New York City's gritty East Village, the revolutionary rock opera 'Rent' tells the story of a group of bohemians struggling to live and pay their rent. 'Measuring their lives in love,' these starving artists strive for success and acceptance while enduring the obstacles of poverty, illness, and the AIDS epidemic,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, ""'Rent' is based on Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical, one of the longest running shows on Broadway. The raw and riveting musical stars Rosario Dawson, Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, and Tracie Thoms and is directed by Chris Columbus."" This is a beautifully performed operatic musical, with most of the original cast reprising their stage roles. Although they can be criticized for no longer looking quite like the starving kid junkies and AIDS patients who took Jonathan Larson's great show to Broadway, their energetic singing and dancing wasn't particularly reflective back then, either. Recasting a couple of roles works, with Ms. Dawson's crucial ""Mimi"" inspired, but any more would have been treading dangerous waters. Perfectly trussed and voiced, Mr. Pascal could be re-making ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and others, if movie musicals were back in vogue. But, this posh bohemian rhapsody never threatened to bring them back.****** Rent (11/23/05) Chris Columbus ~ Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Rosario Dawson, Wilson Jermaine Heredia",Rent
6,jotix100,Bohemians in Alphabet City,7,26 November 2005,"It's obvious this musical has an incredible fan base. That became evident when we saw the movie version the other day. There were a lot of young people in groups that came to see what director Chris Columbus did to the musical that is still running on Broadway after nine years. The screen adaptation is by Steve Chbosky.""Rent"", written and composed by Jonathan Larson, started as a small musical at the NY Theater Workshop and then was transferred to the Nederlander theater where it's still playing. The film has six of the original cast members in it, the exception being Freddie Walker who is substituted by Tracie Thoms and Daphne Rubin-Vega who was the original Mimi, a role that went to Rosario Dawson in the film.This movie will definitely resonate with a younger audience. The music is targeted to them. This is a pop-rock opera and make no mistake about it. Don't go thinking you are going to find anything resembling Puccini's ""La Boheme"". The musical is extremely loosely based on the characters from the opera, but that's where all the comparison ends. The people one sees in the musical are more real because the pain of what is going on in their lives is clearly evident. The AIDS epidemic affects a few of the characters; there are gays and lesbians just being themselves without anyone judging what they do. At the bottom of it all is every day survival in that environment.What ""Rent"" is, it's a celebration of the life on that side of New York during the 80's when anarchists populated the lower east side of Manhattan squatting in abandoned buildings and living precariously at the edge of a society that didn't want them around. The young people that were attracted to the area brought with them a new way of living without prejudice.Alas, everything comes to an end. In fact, just a tour of the area today will show the gentrification that is taking place after Mayor Giuliani and his ilk got these bohemians evicted in order to give way to condominiums and new luxury dwellings where the people the movie celebrate will have no chance to live in them at all. This seems to be the problem when artists create spaces that later on are taken over by the establishment, only to displace the creators, as has happened in Soho, Dumbo, and will not be too far behind in displacing the Williamsburg's artistic settlers.As a film, ""Rent"", has great moments. Even though one has heard the songs many times, there is still a fresh take on them by the talented cast that sing them. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine-Heredia, Jesse Martin, Taye Diggs, Idina Menzel, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson work as an ensemble under the direction of Mr. Columbus, who would have appeared as an unlikely candidate for directing the film, but who brings the best from his talented cast.By the way, ""Rent"" was filmed in the west coast, so don't go looking for any authentic East Village locations, since most of what one sees was probably shot in a studio. The Horseshoe bar is shown on the outside, and a scene of Tompkins Square Park, but the rest is fake.",Rent
7,preppy-3,ALMOST a classic,9,26 November 2005,"The lives and loves of a bunch of poor New Yorkers in the late 1990s. They're gay, straight and bisexual and some are hooked on drugs or infected with AIDS.Bringing back the original cast was a great idea. They may look like in they're in their 30s but it doesn't adversely affect the movie at all. With one exception the cast is right on target. They're full of energy and give everything they got to their roles. Some of the musical numbers leap out at you. Idina Menzel (as Maureen) is a particular standout. The one exception was Jesse L. Martin. He overdoes EVERYTHING. He's playing it like he was doing it on stage--playing to the back row. He should have toned it down for the movie. The story is dated (AIDS was an automatic death sentence when this takes place) but it still works. The score is great. There are no real bad songs--just some OK and others that are great. It's over 2 hours long but I was never bored. My only complaint with the story is that there is a way too unbelievable good ending. But that's a minor quibble.However there is one BIG problem with this: director Chris Columbus. Whoever thought he could direct this? He ALMOST pulls it off. The opening number is certainly an eye-opener and the dramatic stuff works. But he has no idea how to shot musical numbers--they're a real mess. The camera is wavering all over the place. Two particular numbers--""La Vie Boehme"" and Maureen's performance piece--are just horribly done. I'm not a director but even I could have done a better job than this! His direction of the musical numbers lessens what could have been a great musical.I'm giving it a 9 and recommending it--but be warned!",Rent
8,dbborroughs,Even though I cried like a baby I can't whole heartedly recommend this film adaptation,6,4 December 2005,"The film adaptation of Jonathan Larson's stage musical thats been playing for almost ten years on Broadway is the story of a group of friends who live in New York's Alphabet City over the course of a year. By now everyone's heard the tale of how Larson died before the show opened and how it went on to win all sorts of awards. For me the play always felt as though it was a draft or two from being perfect, however since the creator died suddenly before that could happen the play had to remain as it was. It is a good show, that for me was of a time past, even when I saw it a year after it opened.The play has been opened up and reset in a make believe New York that is just as unreal as the stage world it comes from. Songs have been rearranged and rethought. Most of the original cast as been tapped for the film. The results are decidedly mixed. The performances are uneven with Idina Menzel seeming to be in another movie altogether (making you wonder why anyone would date her) while Jesse L Martin blows down the house as Tom Collins and makes you wonder why he's not a superstar.(I won't go into how everyone really is too old for their roles now) The opening up of the film for me diminishes the whole affair and I'm not too sure about some of the some placements. Many of the songs are now people walking and singing or biking and singing and it seems like bad, or just okay music videos, but where videos run 3 or 4 minutes this goes on for over two hours. It mostly just misses (and majorly backfires during I'll Cover You). This should have been directed by a better, more creative human being (I liked the idea of the once attached Spike Lee) What survives are the songs and the power of the music that at times had me crying like a baby. Larson wrote some kick ass songs and much of their power is retained despite Chris Columbus' major mishandling of the material.These are songs about life and death, and their power and life shines through.To be honest the way to have made this film is clearly indicated by the movie itself- it should have been a film by Mark, the film maker in the story. The few times that we see what he's put together, especially at the end, I was struck by the notion that was how the film should have looked and behaved and moved. Someday, perhaps, maybe someone will make a film version that looks and behaves like that, and then we will have a rent thats worth paying for.6.5 out of 10. A Musical about a ""year in the life"" that has music and only flashes of life. Wait for video.",Rent
9,lastliberal,Superb music and great cast,9,28 November 2005,"It is no secret that I am a Law and Order buff. I haven't completely embraced the cast changes and, am, in fact, still upset at the replacement of Elisabeth Röhm with Annie Parisse. But I wanted to see how Jesse L. Martin did in Rent. Regulars know Martin was absent from the last four episodes of the fifteenth season. He left the show temporarily to work on Rent. His character, Det. Green, was shot in the line of duty. For those four episodes, Martin was replaced by Michael Imperioli as Det. Falco.I scanned the reviews and they were not positive. Generally, I believe they all agreed on two stars. However, the reasons given were not valid, in my humble opinion.Almost everybody pans Chris Columbus' direction and Nelson Pressley in the Washington Post was most specific when he said one of the problems was fear of music: It's why Columbus and co-adapter Steve Chbosky added maybe 20 minutes of dialog to what was a sung-through show, almost every bit of which has the opposite of the intended effect. Instead of making things more realistic, it exposes the hokey material. This may be right, but it is comparing the film version to the stage version. Those of us who have not seen the latter would not be bothered unless the dialog didn't work. Maybe Columbus is the second worst director in Hollywood as Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel says, but that doesn't mean the film is not great.It's about the music, and that was superb! Tango Maureen with Tracie Thoms and Anthony Rapp was worth the price of admission by itself. Of course, La Vie Boheme, featuring the entire cast, was also fantastic. And, if Adam Pascal doesn't want to light Rosario Dawson's candle, there are many who will. She may be the newcomer to Rent, but she really added to the film. In fact, she gives me another reason to look forward to the special edition of Sin City next month. I saw her The Rundown and was captivated - she's even better in Rent. Idina Menzel's performance also made the film a treasure. I can't remember the reviewer who panned Columbus' heavy rock background, but I can assure you that it did not interfere at all with the lyrics. They were clear and touching.A.O. Scott of the Times gave the most positive account and I do agree with him partially on one point. He again, makes the mistake of comparing the film to the stage version. He states that some of the performers look a little old for their parts. I found every character, save one, to be perfect. I don't know if it has to do with his character on Law and Order, but I did feel that Martin did not fit in with the rest. I went there to see Jesse and was disappointed, but I was thrilled with the rest of what I saw and heard. Despite the critics, Rent is definitely 3 stars.",Rent
10,george.schmidt,Rousing and often moving big-screen adaptation of the colossal Broadway blockbuster musical,7,13 December 2005,"RENT (2005) *** Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Rosario Dawson, Jesse L. Martin, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Idina Menzel, Tracie Thoms, Taye Diggs, Sarah Silverman, Anna Deavere Smith. Rousing and often moving big-screen adaptation of the colossal Broadway blockbuster musical about East Village NYC art scene and squatters rights in late '80s AIDS era delivered with verve and panache in spite of the unlikely helmsmanship in the form of Chris Columbus (!) who acquits himself nicely with a fine production design executed by Howard Cummings and of course the late Jonathan Larson's overwhelming songs brimming with enthusiastic gusto from most of the original cast (Dawson and Thoms are the sole replacements and both have the singing chops to stand there ground).",Rent
11,evanston_dad,Why Does It Seem So Much Whinier Than It Did on Stage?,6,29 November 2005,"They waited too long to adapt ""Rent"" to the screen, and as a result Chris Columbus's film seems dated and irrelevant. A bunch of 30 something's (perhaps it was unwise to use the original, now too old, cast members) complaining about having to pay their rent, refusing to work for a living and spouting sanctimonious crap about how much the artistic life is better than the corporate one (though not one of them has ever had a corporate job, so how would they know?) is just too much for this 30-year-old (who doesn't have a choice about not working in order to pay for a mortgage) to take.On stage, ""Rent"" was fresh and exhilarating. It was about the freedom to be whatever you choose to be and a celebration of art of all kinds. It didn't feel preachy, condescending or smug. It took place in an artificial world and a hefty dose of melodrama and unlikely plot contrivances were easier to accept given the fact that it was 1.) a piece of theatre and so by necessity an illusion to begin with and 2.) based on an opera where melodramatics are readily accepted. In bringing the musical to the film, and adding an ill-fitting realistic structure to the material, much gets lost in the translation. The plot contrivances are not easy to overlook, and everything feels arbitrary (let's see, who's sleeping with who now?) The music still sounds great and the cast does have a lot of chemistry. Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Idina Menzel are the two original cast members who make the easiest jump to the big screen. Adam Pascal looks lost and Jesse L. Martin mugs too much. Of the newcomers, Tracie Thoms is the best addition as Joanne. Rosario Dawson is fine in the role of Mimi, but that character doesn't seem like much of a character on screen. And Taye Diggs' role is nearly written out of the film.Really, to be honest, none of the characters is much more than a type, easily summarized in a sentence. This was true of the stage version as well, but there the music was allowed to define the characters. On screen, Columbus must come up with things for the actors to do and images for the audience to look at, and he comes up with nothing memorable.Not every single play, book or musical needs to be made into a film, and I wish producers would figure that out. I love movies, but I love movies when they're cinematic or tell a story in a way that could only be told via the medium of film. I'm all for people who don't have access to ""Rent"" in its stage version being able to see it, but perhaps a filmed version of the stage production would have been a better way to go. This film will make people who don't already know the material wonder what all the fuss is about.Grade: B-",Rent
12,AlsExGal,This film really touched me,8,24 April 2015,"I am very surprised at some of the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so ""out there"" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually.You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of ""I'll Cover You"", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material.",Rent
13,ferguson-6,First time Renter,5,28 November 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. When discussing ""RENT"" there are two types of people. Those who are Rent-heads and have seen the stage production (maybe several times) and those who have heard so much of it over the years, but never had the opportunity to see the play. Admittedly, I fall into the second category and came into the film with high expectations.What I saw was a film that featured wonderful music, but seemed very dated and lacked a single character I cared about. The film features most of the original Broadway cast, with Rosario Dawson (Mimi) and Tracie Thoms being the notable and talented exceptions. While enjoying the individual performances very much - especially Jesse L. Martin (Tom Collins) and Idina Menzel (Maureen), I must say I was shocked at how little to offer most of the characters had. Being a struggling artist or idealist does not qualify one for idolization or empathy. Certainly choosing to stick needles in one's veins does not promote caring from this film goer. Why should I care that it takes Roger over a year to write one song? What is he contributing to society? What do any of them contribute? They just complain when Taye Diggs wants to kick them out of his building since they haven't paid rent in OVER A YEAR!!! They get nasty and accuse him of changing and losing sight of their dream. How about he grew up and realized that contributing nothing and begging for rent, utilities and meals does not work in the real world? Anyway, I could go on, but basically I disagree with the philosophy of the movie and enjoyed the music. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"" and ""Harry Potter"") has made many Rent-heads happy, but I believe any director could have accomplished this.",Rent

Among them is a struggling guitarist; a drug addict exotic dancer; a filmmaker; a Santa Claus transvestite; and a cheating lesbian. Strong material sometimes overlaps subplots with an ending that may leave viewers with hope or depression. Director Chris Columbus handles the musical numbers with energy and flair.

Dawson plays the exotic dancer who is HIV positive, and Rapp plays a filmmaker under the same circumstances. Diggs plays the landlord issuing the eviction. Pascal plays a musician also with HIV and a drug habit. Jesse L. Martin plays a gay dancer who is HIV positive, and that is themed throughout the film.

15,gradyharp,A Committed Cast Salvages Rent,3,22 February 2006,"Having seen RENT on the stage with the eardrum assaulting, miked sound from each performer's head mike coupled with the small but deadly 'pit band' this viewer rented this film with trepidation. And after paying close attention to the transfer of the play to the screen little has change in feelings about this work.Loosely based on Puccini's 'La Boheme' (with some direct quotes in the score) this musical drama has much to say about AIDS, kids as artists, survival, all forms of gay life, extended family - many subjects that make it worthy of production. The cast performs extremely well from the opening 'Chorus Line' takeoff through the intimate and blaring production numbers. The pacing is excellent, the cinematography is good, the mood is right. So why the three star rating? For this viewer/listener the score is so thread bare and trite that it is difficult to understand why it has attracted such huge success. There is one song (which opens the show) and otherwise the rest of the score melts into an indistinguishable mélange of repetition. The cast carries it off admirably, but at the end of the work the impact is more in the idea than the execution. Overrated. Grady Harp, February 06",Rent
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Rent,6,1 April 2006,"Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes. Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear. Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes. How do you measure, measure a year? In daylights, in sunsets, in midnights in cups of coffee. In inches, in miles in laughter in strife. In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes - how do you measure a year in the life? How about love? How about love? How about love? Measure in love... seasons of love.The musical movie reunites most of the original cast in the Broadway production, making it a pretty accurate film version in terms of having the right persons play the roles they've already become familiar with. Telling the life of a struggling group of Bohemians in the East Village of New York City, having the musical immortalized on celluloid enabled the production to reach out to commercial masses at the price of a movie ticket.Dealing primarily with the love and lives of these friends, we cover all grounds with gay, lesbian and heterosexual love, and treading upon themes like drug use and AIDS. You have Jon-Bon-Jovi look/sound-alike rocker Roger Davis (Adam Pascal), with a scarred emotional drug filled ex-relationship getting it on with exotic-dancer-with-current-drug-use-problem Mimi Marquez (Rosario Dawson), aspiring filmmaker Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp) whose ex-girlfriend Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel) left him for her butch lover lawyer Joanne Jefferson (Tracie Thoms), and two gay buddies Tom Collins (Jesse L Martin) and Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) who meet by chance when Tom was mugged on the streets. They sure ain't no Brady Bunch, with serious adult issues to grapple with, like urm, paying their rent on time? However it doesn't bore with the issues, and entertains with the many (at least 20) musical numbers. so much so that almost each time a cast member opens his/her mouth, they come out singing. Which for a minute, might seem a bit out of place, but then you forget you're watching a musical on film, a made for a 3-D world put flat on a 2-D screen. It compensates somewhat though by having the camera constantly move to give the illusion of space.Perhaps the themes and character lifestyle didn't appeal to me, so I didn't really dig the storyline, though I didn't really dislike it either. Some plots degenerate into the usual A-meets-B, A-loses-B, A-reconciles-with-B. Notice I didn't use boy-girl, as the same plot gets rehashed for most of the characters, which made it seem like groundhog with different characters.Live Life, Love All, sounds like a Hard Rock Cafe slogan. Sure I enjoyed the music, and the visuals which accompanied the music, but that's about it. By the time the heartwarming ending rolled in, I was too jaded by it all to care too much.",Rent
17,jdesando,It awakens thoughts of love and hope.,8,22 November 2005,"""We're all renting."" Now there's an old adage that could serve as the motto for the musical Rent as well as for each of our short lives. The new film Rent, expertly directed by the multi-talented Chris Columbus, romanticizes the bohemian culture of New York at the beginning of the last century's last decade. Because we were all just learning about the scourge of AIDS and the challenges of multi-sexuality, it is as much the stage and screen version of Philadelphia as it is the underside of the romantic Moulin Rouge. Regardless, there is nothing romantic about AIDS or trying to pay rent in NYC. As Susan Sontag says, ""AIDS obliges people to think of sex as having, possibly, the direst consequences: suicide. Or murder."" For a musical that won the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for drama and four Tony Awards, among others, the barrage of muscular songs leaves little time for any serious dialog about the dangers of poverty (But, hey, this is a musical, so don't demand a reality that would strip it of its essential fantasy), yet the effects of drug use are apparent throughout. Rent has the West Side Story feel of reality massaged, prettied if that is possible in the slums of New York, unafraid to shout that Puccini didn't bother about realism either because operas and musicals take a pass in that category in order to celebrate the human spirit of hope through song. Not only does La Boheme come to mind but also Les Miserables in its impoverished heroes' own way. Chicago is the opposite: uptown and glossy.Having just seen a fine adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, depicting the opposite end of the social order (albeit early 19th century England) from 20th century New York, I am struck by the extremes of living, so entertainingly presented through dialog and cinematography in the former and song and set design in the latter. Both films, however, exalt the primacy of true love no matter what one's place in the pecking order or size of bank account. Rent's easy way of celebrating gay love adds a dimension Austen never faced.In the mid eighties, I spurned a veiled call for help from a former college chum, who worked in the city and contracted AIDS from dirty needles. Because I thought it could be spread like a cold, I did not let him visit me and my family in the Midwest. Of course he died before I learned more about his condition, me a victim of my ignorance and detachment from the real lives of the urban poor. Rent makes me cry when I think of my struggling artist friend alone and misunderstood. Rent awakens thoughts of love and hope for all of us.",Rent
18,DKosty123,Best Rock Opera Since TOMMY,10,15 January 2006,"I can not find a better thing to say about this film except it is not only the best rock opera since TOMMY, but it is even better than TOMMY which is considered a classic of this genre. The performances in this film are all top notch. The films avoids the staginess that often happens when a Broadway show comes to film. The locations in New York are brilliantly done.The producers were also very smart in keeping almost all the Broadway cast intact and it really shows. This is a film that when it first started having no advance knowledge of what I was seeing when I went in the theater, I was thinking I might not think much of it. Then, as I got to the end of the first sequence I found I was hooked. That is the illustration of how well this movie is done.There is a very serious tone in the message of this film as the plot involves the cost to a group of friends of people contracting HIV/AIDS. Even as I write this, the rate of infection in the US has not slowed down in the last 10 years. This message is poignantly portrayed in this film.The film not only gets you involved in the characters & is deeply moving as you see it, but it also sends an important message without getting up on a soapbox about that message. This film should win some awards. The music is excellent to, I advise anyone who gets a chance to see this one. This is a excellent film.",Rent
19,Buddy-51,the squatter as hero,4,20 November 2006,"In terms of both format and style, ""Rent"" - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots fairly firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition. Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters. In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings. This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like ""Phantom of the Opera,"" which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like ""Rent,"" which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience. I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers ""Rent"" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, ""Rent"" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.The story, a modern day update of ""La Boheme"" set in Greenwich Village, starts on Christmas Eve, 1989, and ends on Christmas Eve, 1990. This was at the height of the AIDS epidemic, and, indeed, many of the film's characters - primarily gay men and former junkies - are struggling with the disease (AIDS being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story). There's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists (one is tempted to call them ""deadbeats"") from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re-developing a city block.""Rent"" - with its noble ""performance artists"" doing battle against the Big Bad Corporate Bullies - feels less like a relic from the '80's than one from the '60's. Though intended to be the heroes of the piece, the artists and bohemians often come across as naïve, painfully self-absorbed, and annoyingly self-righteous, an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local ATM machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend's name (the heavily allegorical ""Angel"") as the password (this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man). Anything's better than actually working, I suppose, and becoming a tool of corporate America. When one of the men finally takes a dreaded ""job"" ( a mere sinecure, I might add) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes (horrors!), he acts as if he is selling his soul to Satan, and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest-to-God paycheck. I wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them.With the exception of newcomer Rosario Dawson, the filmmakers have retained most of the original Broadway cast members for the movie, and even though their acting isn't all that impressive, some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing. In his direction, Chris Columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production, but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we're watching. Despite the constantly tracking - sometimes even spinning - camera he has chosen to employ, the film still feels stagy, over-stylized and artificial in almost every scene.As to the libretto by the late Jonathon Larsen, only one tune strikes me as truly memorable, while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling. One of the problems, too, with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian, pedestrian and prosaic - when they aren't pseudo-intellectual drivel on the order of ""the opposite of war isn't peace; it's creation"" - that they become unintentionally funny when set to music. It's not for nothing that the Sharks and the Jets didn't actually sing out most of their confrontations.There are, admittedly, some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters, but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings I have ever seen in a motion picture. In that one crucial moment, the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce, taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it.I don't question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for ""Rent"" (or of its many devoted followers), but it's hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people - especially ""sensitive"" artists - should be allowed to live on other people's properties for free.",Rent
20,cherold,"a mixed bag, but quite good overall",7,1 December 2005,"I am fascinated by how all over the map critical response to this movie is. At metacritic reviews seem to be evenly placed from brilliant to abhorrent. I didn't know what to expect, and at first I was not too optimistic. The movie begins with a big noisy number that felt unfocused and drifted into a plot that seemed instantly banal. But when Rosaria Dawson walked in with a candle things improved considerably. The candle song is probably the best thing in the movie, a Sondheimesque number nicely filmed, and Dawson is radiant, easily besting everything else in the film.From there on things were mixed. Some numbers were standard bland Hollywood fare, but others, like one at a lesbian commitment center, were excellent. The cast, almost all from the Broadway production except for Dawson and Tracie Thoms, was a mix of forgettable and terrific. Oddly enough, all the terrifics were female. In fact, all the women were great (although no one could touch Dawson, who I've never seen before but will definitely keep an eye out for in future), but the men came across as efficiently talented but rather forgettable. The biggest weakness in the film is Roger Davis, who's L.A. rocker singing voice seems wildly inappropriate for an New York musician.There are also places where it just misses. Angel's character isn't as effective as it should be for the role he plays in the others' lives, and Benjamin feels like an underwritten foil rather than a flesh and blood character. Having never seen the theatrical production I don't know if this is true of that as well.Overall though, it's pretty good. Columbus isn't a great director so you don't have a Fosse-quality production, but at his best he rises a little above competence, although at other times he slips a little beneath it, failing to hold things together on some of the more chaotic numbers. The movie is most notable for its tear jerking qualities. This is one sad movie, and while I hate to admit it, I cried a whole bunch in this one. I was particularly struck by a very simple scene in which a support group of AIDS sufferers sing their fears.By the way, I live in the East Village, and it's really not made up entirely of gay people, people with AIDS, or a combination Nor was it in the 80s when I moved here. And Life Cafe isn't big enough for a musical number. FYI.",Rent
21,Robert_duder,"An absolutely incredible look at life, love, and dealing with every day",10,8 March 2006,"Some will say the genre of the film musical is dead and they aren't entirely wrong. In a day and age where only one musical surfaces every few years musicals seem to belong on the stage for the most part. Sometimes capturing a stage play especially a phenomenal one on screen can be very difficult. I have never seen any version of Rent, in fact I knew so little about it but I was tired of getting the lead song stuck in my head from the commercials so I watched it. WOW...just WOW...this film is one of the best movies in existence PERIOD!! It's through provoking, emotional, so incredibly real and touching and beautiful and interesting and brilliant. How's that for you?? This movie is one EVERYONE MUST SEE!! The music is brilliant and it's not just there to add songs to a story...it IS the story.Where to begin in this cast of brilliant performers. Anthony Rapp...because I think he is the lead character more than the others. He plays Mark, the straight, struggling, heart broken inhabitant of the loft who is trying to find love. Betrayed by his girlfriend, dealing with the people around him and desperately trying to make ends meet as a film maker. His songs are so powerful and moving and his expressions and movements truly capture the anxiety of the whole group and the era and what they are dealing with. Hands down he should have gotten an Academy Award nomination (Rent was completely shut out.) Adam Pascal plays Mark's best friend, room mate, former junkie, aids stricken, musician who is trying his best to not get involved with their downstairs neighbor because he fears for his life and letting people get close to him. His brooding emotional performance captures a completely different side than anyone else. He too is equally as brilliant. His romance with Mimi is touching and very real. Mimi is played by Rosario Dawson in her best role hands down. She's a dancer and a junkie and very disillusioned with herself and love. She's never known family or love and yet this group embrace her and show her how much they care. Dawson is feisty and exotic and at the same time intense and emotional. Jesse Martin does a good job (although not quite as stand out as the previous three mentioned) as lovable Tom Collins who finds true love after being mugged in an alley way. Also struggling with aids his performance just isn't quite as emotionally touching as the rest of them. He still rounds out the cast nicely and his songs are good although not as well done as some of the others. Wilson Jermaine Heredia plays Collins' soul mate Angel. He definitely gives some flare to the film and his songs are funny and heart warming and I think him and Martin have great chemistry as lovers. They are cute!! Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms plays Maureen Johnson, and Joanne Jefferson, lovers from very different sides of life. Maureen is an artist, struggling, feisty and not exactly monotonous. Joanne is upper class, a lawyer, and desperately in love with Maureen. Together this group of Bohemian (Eighties hippies for those of you who aren't sure) become a family, supporting each other through each moment of their lives both bad and good as they struggle to find their place in the world.The movie is so sad...from beginning to end there is just this pessimistic cloud over it and yet it's beautiful how close they are and they are more of a family than blood. This is one of the greatest ensemble casts I have ever seen. The music fits into the film better than any other musical I have ever seen. The songs are catchy and even if you don't like musicals you can still enjoy the brilliant story. I'm not a HUGE musical fan although I like some but this one just blew me away completely. Chris Columbus directs this masterpiece and he spins a gritty and dark vision of eighties New York. He also adds in his unique style that adds a little comedy and heart to the hopelessness they all feel. It turns out he was the ideal director for the film. If you haven't figured it out I think RENT is one of the best films of last year PERIOD!! Any lover of film, music or a beautiful story needs to see this movie. I will watch it again and again as one of my all time favorites. 10/10",Rent

Characters fall in love and die. Several of them have HIV and they all seem to be artists, which is why they are poor? I liked the songs and lyrics.

He looked fabulously smashing dressing up as a drag queen. He really had a lot of energy and his love for Tom Collins just made you smile! I was so gutted that he died from aids. I felt so deeply sorry for Collins cause they were such a cute couple together :((Roger had the best voice with his own rock style. I think himself and Mini were meant for each other.

27,kevin_robbins,This is an elite musical that's a must see.,10,23 July 2021,"Rent is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a group of friends in the same housing development in New York. Their landlord is about to throw them all out and repurpose the building. We watch each of the friends balance challenges in life and do what they need to, to survive. This movie is directed by Chris Columbus (Home Alone 1 & 2) and stars Rosario Dawson (Deathproof), Taye Diggs (Equilibrium), Anthony Rapp (Dazed and Confused), Adam Pascal (School of Rock), Jesse L. Martin (The Flash) and Wilson Jermaine Heredia (Flawless). The storyline for this picture is outstanding and for a musical feels as relatable as any. The character's struggles with society, addiction and survival is so well depicted. The songs were a nice mix with my favorite being the ones about their relationship status. I also appreciated the injection of curses in this as they made it feel more realistic. There's also a nice blend of characters with different sexuality, cultures and upbringings.

28,dee.reid,"Pay the ""Rent,"" and see it",10,26 February 2006,"I didn't think it was possible that I could enjoy this movie as much as I did, being I typically don't like musicals but this one really moved me. It's ""Rent,"" the film adaptation written by Stephen Chbosky and directed by ""Home Alone"" Chris Columbus from Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer and Tony Award-winning musical.I won't waste my time with a long, drawn-out review, so my remarks will be brief. I'll state right now that I'm not familiar with the bohemian lifestyle, much less Broadway plays, but ""Rent"" shows that amongst poverty, artistic starvation and the onslaught of A.I.D.S. in 1989, you can't help but be moved by a great many emotions. By itself, the actors find their modes and move with some of the best performance pieces and songs I've heard in a long while from any musical.In New York City's gritty East Village, ""Rent"" tells the story of eight people and their respective desires to improve their lives while struggling with poverty and A.I.D.S. and doing their best to not let these pains get in the way of their friendship. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Rosario Dawson, Jesse L. Martin, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Idina Menzel, and Tracie Thoms are these young people, and ""Rent"" is their story.It's a wonderful and bold film, and the story's detractors are just ignorant or envious that ""Rent"" has risen to the degree of fame it has. It's definitely touching and pierces the heart in ways something of this strength should. I loved it, and I'm looking forward to purchasing the DVD.10/10",Rent
29,noralee,Good Try at Making a Realistic Movie Musical,7,17 December 2005,"In ""Rent,"" director Christopher Columbus does a good job of making a Hollywood-type NYC 1989 that would exist on a parallel continuum with the 1960's NYC of ""West Side Story"" and the 1970's NYC of Milos Forman's ""Hair."" Blending sets and outdoor scenes, this Lower East Side seems more like the post-apocalypse Detroit of ""Land of the Dead"" than the real Alphabet City, but I'm sure ""La Boheme"" had the same relationship with the real Paris. A shot of the World Trade Center reminds us that this is pre-9/11. At least the script does clearly establish these characters' voluntary poverty as struggling artists and/or addicts who are refugees from suburbia, eschew day jobs, and live and work in high rise enormous spaces with long vistas.The big plus of the film is the engaging cast, most of whom recreate their theatrical roles. Particularly outstanding voice-wise is Tracie Thoms, though she only gets to break out in a couple of scenes. Wilson Jermaine Heredia in the even smaller role of ""Angel"" also shines in song and dance. I hope Jesse L. Martin doesn't get straight laced into ""Law and Order"" forever as he is a very appealing song and dance man. As a newcomer to the production, Rosario Dawson is outstanding as ""Mimi,"" more charismatically confident than when I saw her this summer at Shakespeare in Central Park in the ""Two Gentleman of Verona"" musical and that she only got to briefly show fiercely in Alexander. Sarah Silverman has a funny cameo.While I haven't seen the Broadway production as the songs I've heard over the years struck me as pleasant pop more than rock, the arrangements here weakened their impact even more and undercut the energy of the performers. A couple of the songs are just restlessly weak (particularly Idina Menzel's performance artist piece), but several of the songs have real zest, such as the opener, ""The Tango Maureen"" and ""La Vie Boheme,"" which has silly lyrics. The operetta-like recitatives did not come across as well. While the camera work keeps circling around the characters to try and keep the momentum going, some parts just drag and could be more tightly edited.The deaths are commendably far more realistic than most musicals where characters die of Movie Star Disease, as AIDS here is real issue, though one character's seeming resurrection is consequently a bit surprising.",Rent
30,EUyeshima,Jonathan Larson's Powerful Musical With Energy Intact and Not as Dated as Feared,9,12 December 2005,"Suffice it to say that the movie version of ""Rent"", nine years after it exploded on Broadway, delivers the goods in late 2005. That in itself is no small feat since its then-topicality brings the story a somewhat tainted 1990's time capsule feel. Credit needs to go to director Chris Columbus, who has the audacity to bring back six of the eight original cast members and does surprisingly little to alter the story structure for the screen. The late Jonathan Larson's energetic, hook-heavy music is what made the show so memorable to me when I saw it during its first year in New York, and the now-familiar score still maintains its searing drive as it flows through the episodic story of almost starving artists living in the squalor of Manhattan's Alphabet City in 1989 with the AIDS epidemic running rampant (currently the neighborhood is going through significant urban renewal). In fact, four of the eight main characters are HIV-positive, and this makes the story resonate as much as the vital music does today.Having the cast return to roles they originated nearly a decade earlier when they epitomized twenties angst is a risky move as the characters would seem to be less compelling inhabited by actors now in their mid-thirties. As it turns out, age is not the issue versus the ability of the actors to generate the excitement they did onstage. Their contributions at minimum are solid and effervescent with some standing out, for example, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, the geeky documentary filmmaker who records the lives of his friends with candor and regret. Jesse L. Martin - he of the dazzling smile and honey-coated baritone - seems genuinely liberated from years of button-down civility on ""Law and Order"" to play computer programmer Tom Collins smitten with drag queen Angel portrayed with unbridled pride and poignancy by Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Martin's and Heredia's giddy duet, ""I'll Cover You"", is full of such romantic fervor that other more traditional couplings can only aspire to such dizzying heights.Idina Menzel plays the bisexual performance artist Maureen Johnson with real brio though she seems a bit over-the-top even when not performing her supposedly avant-garde work, ""Over the Moon"". Despite nailing his passionate solo, ""One Song Glory"", Adam Pascal looks somewhat lost in his portrayal of Roger Davis, the tortured singer-songwriter who begrudgingly falls for Mimi Marquez, the borderline junkie/exotic dancer downstairs. With her saucer eyes and flirty demeanor, Rosario Dawson replaces original Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and she turns out to be an excellent choice, showing off unseen singing and dancing skills within the context of the most screen-savvy performance of the cast. She does an appropriately saucy turn on the showstopper, ""Out Tonight"". Rounding out the principal cast are another newcomer, Tracie Thoms, a belter who plays Maureen's lover yuppie lawyer Joanne Jefferson (and consequently wails with immaculate bravura the bridge to the show's most famous song, ""Seasons of Love""), and Taye Diggs, who manages to make the most of the relatively thankless role of Benny Coffin.No matter the variability of the acting, everyone sings with glorious power, a fact made clear at the outset by Columbus, who smartly has them sing ""Seasons of Love"" in the manner it was introduced onstage with spotlights on a darkened stage. He also takes cinematic liberties which work in some of the numbers retranslated into the film, such as ""Light My Candle"", ""Tango: Maureen"" and ""Take Me As I Am"". Some like the centerpiece ensemble, ""La Vie Boheme"", work almost the same way they did on stage with its sheer exuberance intact. Some scenes don't work as well, for example, ""What You Own"" where Roger is literally living out the symbolic lyrics in Santa Fe. With its more naturalistic tone in spite of the numerous breaks into song and dance, the movie reminds me less of Robert Wise's and Jerome Robbins' adaptation of ""West Side Story"" than of Milos Forman's take on ""Hair"". Be forewarned that those who loved the stage version are the ones who will most be in thrall over the film version. That would include me.",Rent
31,aharmas,Love and Life,9,27 November 2005,"There are a lot of lovely moments in this film. These remind us of what friendship, lovers, and life can offer us. In the film, we are witnesses to a group of people who share the ups and downs of life in a N.Y. city tenement. Their imperfect existence has plenty of grit, unpleasantness, and for some members of the audience, some material which might be hard to digest. However, what is important is what lies at its very core: a positive and uplifting way to see life, with an outlook to not waste life and cherish what is important.It takes a while for the film to grab you because of its unorthodox musical approach and its deceptively simplistic lyrics. Once you're in the middle of the experience, you understand in what direction the story is going. There are several outstanding moments in the film, and these happen when superb singing accompanies the right interpretation of this perceptive study of life. Chris Columbus might not have been the most adequate director for this enterprise, and yet he acquits himself very well with his naturalistic approach. Sometimes, I was wishing another director had been in charge. I would have loved to see what would have happened during ""La Vie Boheme"" number had the people responsible for ""Chicago"" had been in charge. Even, the very talented Spielberg (who should direct a musical, soon) popped in my mind.Yet, I shouldn't complain because the material is solid, and the cast is very talented and likable, giving their best, creating and recreating characters that are very similar to us, with real feelings, with real problems, and very complicated lives. The film reminded me to appreciate what is out there, what might happen if I don't do that, and that it really doesn't matter where something important happens, as long as it does and is meaningful.""Rent"" matters because it reflects values that might not look traditional, yet are in truth, what makes us human.",Rent

In fact, it made me want to go see the stage version-in fact it made me a little (or a lot) regretful that I hadn't already done so.I do think you need to be less familiar with the play version and more just a really strong fan of musicals period to appreciate this. I for one grew up loving musicals and am thrilled the movie musical is coming back again. (We can thank Chicago for that a bit.) But Rent the movie is an energetic, tremendously well done quality piece of cinema, featuring an array of very talented performers and is both entertaining as well as very very moving and powerful. I really did enjoy this and really do regret never seeing this on Broadway, especially since I am a fan of stage shows as well as film.The person I saw this with is a ""renthead"" and was able to fill in some of The blanks after the movie. I was very impressed with the fact that most of the stars were also the original stage performers and my favorite character was Rosario Dawson who was every bit as good as the others. The musical numbers were, for the most part, very well done and though of coarse I liked some better then others, most of them sounded fresh and energetic and were very good. I was very into this from the start and barely noticed the time going by. I did not find this dated as many have said (though had I seen this 10 or 15 years ago, in my ""Sid And Nancy"" days, it just might be my favorite movie) and I loved the movie's Imagery of New York City which was spectacular.As much as I liked Rent, I didn't love it in the way I loved a movie like Chicago (though I have the feeling the stage version is a perfect 10.) Rent has the same problem as one of my favorite Broadway shows, Phantom Of the Opera. That problem is, as your watching the movie version, you can't help but think of the stage version. In Phantom's case, it made me miss the show. In Rent's case it made me wish I had seen the show. Basically, both these movies seem to be plays first, movies second. I guess the difference between them and a movie like Chicago is at the end of Chicago the movie, you want to immediately watch it again. It doesn't make you even think about the play. Rent, while being a very, very good movie, is also a movie I could tell immediately, is more suited to the stage and I could also tell that on stage it must be magnificent.I would encourage anyone who has not seen the play to see the movie anyway.

This is not your great-grand-mothers musical. The only fault with this movie is that where you thought it might be over it isn't. It goes on and on. The musical numbers ""Sante Fe,"" ""Light My Candle"" are my favorites. Rent is a 2005 American musical drama film directed by Chris Columbus. It is an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, in turn based on Giacomo Puccini's opera La bohème. The film depicts the lives of several Bohemians and their struggles with sexuality, drugs, paying their rent, and life under the shadow of AIDS. It takes place in the East Village of New York City from 1989 to 1990. The film features six of the original Broadway cast members reprising their roles.In this film the cast is dealing with life. Some of them have HIV and see no future. They are however a core group of friends that are a family unit. They all support each other in ways a real family can't. I know the director did the movies ""Home Alone"", and ""Mrs Doubtfire"" and he would not of been my 1st choice however he did a great job. ( I hate Harry Potter but that wasn't his fault). Buy this DVD and share it with friends!",Rent

These starving artists strive for success and acceptance while enduring the obstacles or poverty, illness, and the AIDS epidemic.As you all know, this is the film version of the Pulitzer and Tony Award winning musical, Rent. From the beginning of the movie, a song is sang. Throughout the whole movie, the songs that are being sang are entertaining! I just sang my way through the whole movie. This movie is a bit long, although I wasn't bothered by that.The love showed on the screen is remarkable. It kinda makes you feel sad when you see people on the streets of New York, out in the cold. This film takes over one year, one date being specific: December 24, 1989-1990. There are gay characters in the film. This film is both entertaining, one the songs, and sad at the same time.

36,Cosmoeticadotcom,Better than expected,6,17 September 2008,"Let me state that I have never been a fan of musicals. I loathed most of the Golden Age Hollywood musicals that my parents loved, and those from my youth, the 1960s and 1970s (Hair, Jesus Christ, Superstar, Godspell, etc.), did not move me, either- at least dramatically, even if the songs were great. There's something about people breaking out into song that is just so forced that, dramatically, is too much to overcome. Perhaps the only film musical that totally worked for me was Evita, and that's because it was one long music video, from beginning to end, with literally only one sentence of spoken dialogue. However, musicals have been making a comeback in film. Moulin Rouge led the way, a few years back, and it's a truly great musical, if not a film. Chicago won an Academy Award for Best Picture the following year, even though it's not half the film, nor musical, Moulin Rouge is. Then, came the Cole Porter biopic, De-Lovely, and, well, Cole Porter, Cole Porter. It was a very good film that incorporated music wonderfully and intriguingly into its plot, the life's tale of the legendary composer. Next came Rent, the film version of Jonathan Larson's late 1980s musical that dominated Broadway last decade, which updated Puccini's opera, La Bohéme for the AIDS era. Surprisingly, while only also a great composer of ballads and rip roaring rock tunes. Without doubt, Rent has as many great songs as Hair or Godspell ever did- perhaps more.Yes, the actual story the tale tells is slight and often silly, if I'm being generous.Yes, the characters are stereotypes and caricatures, there is no real development of their psyches, and the film ends in shameless melodrama- the abandoned and now homeless Mimi's death and resurrection, and preachiness- in its regard of the anomic, dead transvestite Angel as somehow the apex of the human experience. But, as I always asked people who harped about the 1998 Hollywood version of Godzilla, 'What did you really expect from a film where a giant lizard stomps on New York; Brando in Streetcar?' Similarly, what can one reasonably expect from a work that glorifies AIDS suffering in such a Romantic light, as well the inanities and irresponsibilities of young drug addicts and sexual freak shows who somehow believe that the world owes them something merely for their breathing, and that having to actually pay rent to someone to live somewhere is a form of fascism? If you answered, 'Well, maybe, good music,' you are absolutely right, and, fortunately, Rent has much of that to spare. Ultimately, the music, and Larson's brilliance in the crafting of his infectiously catchy tunes, is the film's saving grace. And, when has even a little bit of grace ever been a bad thing?",Rent
37,lambiepie-2,We've all Gotta Pay the Rent...,7,27 August 2006,"I've noticed that the success rate of taking a hit Broadway stage musical from the stage to the screen of the past 20 years has not been good. Could be because some plays are better left seen live so that one could grasp the entire experience as it was meant to be. Could be that Hollywood tends to want to make sure it's ""box-office"" friendly and starts making changes to the vision that made the play endearing in the first place.Rent is neither the worst or the best of this genre. It's actually in the middle. It's a decent adaptation from stage to screen but not necessarily one of the best that could have been done to such a wonderful stage play.Regardless, this is a character driven presentation and for you to understand what is going on, you've gotta ""feel"" the characters. Of course, my favorite is Angel - and to me this character is why we can see a year in the life of those around Angel. Up, optimistic, talented, brave, street-wise, sick and someone you'd root for to win even though you know all of this. Everyone in this ensemble has parts of Angel, is touched by Angel, wanted a second of what Angel had. But they too have their own realities.I think too many people get caught up on the AIDS side of the story. While it is important, it also is there to show how much life this ensemble continually tries to have. These are young artists in New York at a time when the disease was not clearly understood, when understanding was not where it appears to be now, when medicines were not easy to get - so of course AIDS is going to play a part in this ensembles hopes, dreams, loves, friendships and lives as they all still have to try to pay the rent. And plus, here is an ensemble of bohemians that interact with each other through the good and the bad, (even losing one of their own to corporate greed) and they all care about their little group.The two things I didn't like about Rent was that many of the musical numbers didn't flow for me. They seemed forced between dialog and if I could have had a choice there wouldn't have been a need for a musical exchange in those areas, just leave it dialog. And the character of Mimi - while some applaud Rosario Dawson for it, I was just not left overly impressed. This is not to bash the actress, she was acting and very passable, but there was an inner ""fire"", a brasher, dig deep within your soul emotion seemingly missing from this screen performance. For me, the actress was too 'sparkling clean' on screen to be Mimi given her life. Over a year, this Mimi never gave me the change that was needed. In a stage play there are many things you can't do that you can in a film and I feel the filmmakers took a pristine step in this character when they had the chance to expand and cast Mimi for what she was.Rent on film could have gone deeper into the lives of this ensemble, but tried to capture the stage experience - while not trying to capture the stage experience. The results, a few really good moments, but a few times you may fast forward or change the channel to.",Rent
38,film-critic,Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes.,6,4 March 2006,"I do not like to be one of those critics that immediately denounces this film because of the popularity surrounding the Broadway hit. I hope that with this review I do not sound like it, but there were some harsh occurrences that I cannot ""let slide"", while others say they were ""golden"". Imagination is your greatest tool, and you can also take certain justices when performing in front of a live audience that you cannot in cinema. This was a big hurdle to have to cross with the film version of Rent. Again, I don't want to just compare and contrast the film to play, but there was a level of imagination and originality lost in the cinematic version. Instead of dreaming of what New York City was like on stage, director Chris Columbus spoon-feeds it to you. You could literally turn off your mind for this film and still find some slivers of entertainment, but was it the right entertainment? The music was phenomenal, it was impressive to see the original cast (of which I have listened to their original Broadway CD for years now), and there was some interesting points that Columbus chose to keep, and others that he chose to delete. You cannot recreate the imagination of the theater with a film. Shocked to hear myself say that, but it is true. There is something about smelling the person next to you and ""Mooing"" with the tourist on the other side. That is was I missed the most about Rent the film.I loved the beginning of Rent. I initially felt that Columbus was going to successfully pull it off. He was going to bring back the age-old cinema trick of bringing original casts back together to film on a bigger scale. Opening with our entire cast singing the powerful ""Seasons of Love"" to an open stage, I nearly broke into tears at that moment. I saw Columbus going in a very creative direction, and I must admit the opening scene pulled me in. Then, nearly word for word, song for song, he slowly began to befuddle it. Just like the play, for the first half of the film, I think Columbus (and the cast) did a very convincing job. The songs provoked intimate memories, the struggle of life coupled with the power of love shined through, and the independence of living in a huge city like NYC in the late 80s was reborn. The familiar faces of the cast and the crispness of the songs demonstrated how big this Broadway hit was. Columbus took some creative control, which I did not complain with. His change on ""Tango: Maureen"" I thought was a prediction of what he was going to do with the other songs, but alas, that creativity stopped there. I didn't want Rent to be as gritty as Angels in America, yet I didn't want it to be as candy-coated as I witnessed it with Columbus. Character's hair were never tangled or messed up, money again didn't seem to be an issue, and apparently throwing fire into the streets is not a problem in NYC. I realize that Columbus was attempting to capture the inherit history of the musical with these scenes, but we are living in a Hollywood of realism. Rent is a real story, I didn't want it to feel like it was ""faked"". By the end of this film, I had felt that Columbus had ""faked"" me.One aspect of this film that really appealed to me was the return of the original cast. That was a superb decision made by Columbus (and probably DeNiro) that was successfully able to keep some of the original emotion from the stage version. Rosario Dawson annoyed me throughout the film, but outside of that I felt the original cast did a fantastic job. I especially enjoyed Jesse L. Martin's ""Tom Collins"" character. There was so much emotion, so much passion behind his eyes when he spoke that you could not help but immediately love his character. One could say the same about Angel. Anthony Rapp, sadly, seemed angry the entire time about something. Even as he sang of love, his beady little eyes seemed dark and hollow. I think he missed the aura of his character. I, shockingly, also believed that Tracie Thoms did a fantastic job with her character, creating just enough chemistry as well as stern independence to bounce off Idina Menzel (in my opinion stole the show). Taye Diggs, well, he was Taye Diggs. I do not think this film could have been done without these original players back in the roles that rocketed them into the spotlight.I have some friends that have seen the stage version of Rent and listened to the original Broadway cast CD and complain about this film. It may seem like I am doing the same, but I am not complaining, just feeling a bit disappointed. My friends claim that this film just doesn't work in today's society because of the growing awareness of AIDS and medicine's ability to combat the drug. They also whine about the aging actors that were once in their 20s performing this same song and dance routine. I do not agree with any of these comments at all. This is a film/play that does not feel dated to me. It still feels alive due to the suffering in this country surrounding AIDS. Rent is able to do something that other films seem to continually forget to capture, and that is friendship. Rent is about friends, no matter how old they are, always being there for you. It is about having your own independence, while being surrounded by those that accept it. It is about overcoming hardships with the help of these friends. It is about living your life as if it were your last. Rent's themes are relevant today, just as they were ten years ago.Grade: *** out of *****",Rent
39,MrGKB,Glad I finally caught up to this gem...,8,24 October 2006,"...and just a little guilty that I've never made the effort to catch it onstage. I'm a theater person, but for whatever sorry excuse or another, I avoided watching this fine adaptation of the award winning musical. I haven't had this much fun watching an unfamiliar show since ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch."" I laughed, I cried, and I didn't even have to kiss ten bucks goodbye! All I really want to say is ""Wow!"" What a pleasure it was seeing such fine work from relatively ""unknown"" actors, Rosario Dawson notwithstanding. Every last one of them give it their all and just drag (if you'll pardon the pun) the audience into their world and their lives. It felt as though each musical number upped the ante vis-a-vis exquisite choreography and heartfelt singing. I just can't say too many good things about everyone in the cast: Anthony Rapp is superb as wannabe filmmaker, Mark, who's been dumped for a woman, Jesse L. Martin is heartbreakingly perfect as the gay teacher who finds and loses (again, a thousand pardons) the queen of his dreams; Rosario Dawson sexily astonishes as the junkie stripper/artiste who pairs off with Adam Pascal's equally moving junkie ex-rocker, Roger; Idina ""Wicked"" Menzel rules as Mark's performance artist ex, Maureen, and Tracie Thoms easily holds her own as Maureen's Ivy League lesbian paramour; Taye Diggs, who I first saw in ""Go"" and then in the awful ""House on Haunted Hill,"" is suavely perfect as Benjamin Coffin, the sellout, and last but definitely not least, Wilson Jermaine Heredia is both beautiful (something this breeder can't say about very many drag queens) and completely winning as the doomed transvestite, Angel, whose death highlights and cements the bonds of friendship and love between the leads. I could go on, but if you haven't seen this film yet, you're much better off just doing so and forming your own opinion. I doubt you'll be disappointed.Chris Columbus transfers Stephen Chbosky's screenplay of Jonathan Larson's masterwork from stage to film with a cinematic flair that manages to retain the feel of a stage musical to great effect, with no small thanks to Stephen ""Angels in America"" Goldblatt's sure cinematography, Richard ""United 93"" Pearson's tight editing, and the picture perfect sets, art and production design, and costumes. I have no real idea how close to the musical the film version hews, but I couldn't find anything to complain about on first viewing. Perhaps I'll change my tune on further viewings and/or exposure to the stage original.I've little to add beyond the observation that I haven't seen an IMDb voter demographic so heavily female (and positive) in a long time, nor one with over ten thousand votes so heavily weighted with ""10"" votes. I was also intrigued by the ""Top 1000 Voters"" relatively low ratings; what's up with that? Is it that they're predominantly male and no doubt somewhat uncomfortable with themes of homosexuality and AIDS? I can only speculate.At any rate, no question in my mind that ""Rent"" has paid its dues and worked its way into my Top 10 Favorite Musicals list. Now I understand what all the fuss has been about. If you haven't seen this one yet and you have any interest in musicals, do yourself a favor and stop holding out. Pay up and join the legion of ""Rent"" fans!",Rent
40,gftbiloxi,Memorable Cast; Slightlly Weak Adaptation,7,11 June 2007,"Set on some of New York's meanest streets and very loosely based on Puccini's LA BOHEME with the AIDS epidemic substituted for tuberculosis, Jonathan Larson's RENT is an unexpected collage of stark visuals, memorable music and lyrics, and on-the-edge characters--and it was more than enough for the play to win a host of critical accolades, including the 1996 Pulitzer Price for Dramatic literature, an honor only rarely awarded to musical fare. But stage excitement seldom translates undiluted to the screen, and in this RENT is no exception.The basic story remains the same, and in general concerns the various artistic ambitions and romantic complications of several men and women whose savage rebellion against the status quo has led them to hand-to-mouth lives in New York. But even as they come together to protest the impending commercialization of the dilapidated district they call home, their relationships with each other begin to spiral out of control--and the lifestyle of casual sex and drug abuse begins to take a serious toll, with several HIV-positive characters forced to face mortality in increasingly direct ways.With two exceptions, the cast consists of those who originated the roles in the 1996 Broadway show. To my mind, the big noise here is Wilson Jermaine Heredia, who repeats his Tony award-winning performance as Angel, a street musician and drag queen who acts as the emotional center of the group; that said, however, the overall cast is quite fine and plays at full throttle, even if Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel do seem a bit too old for this story of youthful angst some ten years after they originated their roles on the New York stage.Unfortunately, the film stumbles in a visual sense. Certainly there is considerable urban decay on the screen, but it is also very much a Hollywood-ized concept of it; instead of going with a rawly gritty quality, which would have benefited the material, the designers have elected to sweeten everything where possible, and the end result has a slightly ""sanitized for your protection"" quality. But the real stumble is in the adaptation.Apparently the powers-that-be felt that the movie-going public was just not bright enough to sort out who is who and who is doing what; consequently many of the ensemble numbers have been somewhat simplified, and the result is somewhat less exciting that the originals. To add further insult, it also seems very obvious that the powers-that-be drew the line at presenting the show as the opera that it is; on stage, RENT has very little in the way of spoken dialogue, but on screen the adaptors have been careful to separate the major musical numbers with chit-chat that adds nothing to the show and which actually creates yet another and still greater problem.Although RENT is most particularly remembered for such memorable set pieces as ""One Great Song,"" ""Light the Candle,"" ""Tango Maureen,"" and so on, Larson actually planted the a sense of time and place and considerable character development in the small musical transitions between these numbers--and virtually every one of those transitions have been cut in order to accommodate the notion that there has to be spoken dialogue. When you add in one or two very questionable cuts of major songs as well... the end result has a tendency to read as more of a series of very memorable music videos instead of a cohesive whole. It was a bad idea.Even so, and while RENT the movie will never compare to RENT the play, it still has enough going for it to hold you in a very firm grip, and I recommend it.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Rent
41,fwomp,"Same Tempo, Same Old Song",5,16 March 2006,"Musicals aren't my forte  although I did enjoy CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE  so I was hesitant to check out RENT. But after reading about its notable comparisons to La Boehme, and how consumption was replaced by HIV/AIDS, I was intrigued enough to pick up a copy and find out what director Chris Columbus (what an unfortunate name) did with it.I guess I should've stuck with my original movie-musical instincts.RENT is exactly what it claims to be, a musical; and perhaps a bit too much of one. At every opportunity  whether it seems justifiable or not  the cast breaks out into song. I know, I know. It's a musical. What did I expect? Maybe I've been spoiled by the two aforementioned postmodern musicals. They told a story through both a good narrative and songs. And they didn't force feed the audience musical number after musical number after musical number. Let me explain further...This is the modern parable about bohemians living in New York's East Village. They're either all struggling artists, lovers, or victims of the HIV epidemic ...or, sometimes, they're all three (depending on which character you choose to follow). They all live in a substandard building and are having trouble paying the rent (begin opening chorus here). Anthony Rapp (TWISTER, 1996) stars as Mark Cohen, a failed movie-maker who's coming to terms with the loss of his overtly sexy  and apparently bisexual  girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel). He's also been filming all of his friends lives and it is this that gives most of the movie its emotional weight. Adam Pascal (SCHOOL OF ROCK, 2003) plays Roger, Mark's roommate. Roger is dealing with his HIV status by remaining a shut-in after having lost a girlfriend to AIDS. But then Mimi (Rosario Dawson, SIN CITY, 2005) moves in downstairs and Roger is tempted to fall in love again. But his HIV status and his broken heart keep them apart ...in addition to the fact that Mimi is a drug addict and is HIV positive, too. Jesse L. Martin plays Tom Collins (ha-ha), an out of work MIT instructor who returns to the Village to find his friends self-destructing and, amazingly, to find love in the arms of another HIV positive man, Angel (played by an excellent Wilson Jermaine Heredia).It is Angel  I think  that is supposed to represent the glue that holds these ragtag bohemians together, but we see so little of him (up until the hospital scenes where he's dying) that this aspect was nearly lost on me.There are some decent film moments. Some of the more memorable ones (for me) were during the opening when the power to the building they're all living in is shut off and everyone burns something to stay warm, then throws the burning embers out the windows of this multi-story structure (nice imagery). I also liked the scenes involving the HIV support group that showed its members gradually disappearing, a reminder to viewers that HIV tends to be fatal to a huge percentage of those that become infected.But the songs just couldn't hold the movie together. Most of them had the exact same tempo (with the exception of maybe one or two) and blurred or blended together, making me not really care what they were singing about. And with a musical so packed full of songs, that's pretty bad.",Rent
42,cultfilmfan,Rent,10,26 November 2005,"Rent is based on the stage musical which had script and songs written by Jonathan Larson. The film is about seven friends and their relationships together through good times and bad, happiness, tragedy and just about everything that a friendship can go through. The film also deals with sexuality, AIDS, drug addiction and surviving in the big city of New York. These characters and events are all set to musical numbers. Rent has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the entire cast, good cinematography and good film editing. I have never seen the musical Rent on stage so I'm reviewing the film for what I just saw seeing as the story and music are all new to me and I can't compare it to the stage version because I haven't seen it. A lot of the negative reviews that I have seen for Rent seem to be based on critics and viewers who have seen the stage version. Having only seen this version I can say I was very impressed. I really liked the music, the acting and dance cinematography was great and so was the story. The film is filled with many unique and interesting characters and we learn to like and care about every single one of them. The film shows their faults and struggles, but it does not dwell on them and shows them as realistic human beings. I thought the character development was very good in this film because of this. They are believable characters in believable situations. I also found the film full of energy, spirit and emotion. I must also say that I'm very impressed with the film's director Chris Columbus. Chris Columbus is usually known for more family friendly fare such as Home Alone or Mrs. Doubtfire, so he is tackling a pretty different film here and he carries it off beautifully. The direction of the film and just how he staged the songs and put so much energy into the film was just incredible. I was very surprised and filled with admiration seeing as Rent is a much more mature and adult film than what he has done before. I thought the film and it's characters and songs were great and I also loved the power, emotion and energy this film breathed. It really was a great movie going experience and Chris Columbus made it seem like in some ways we were watching a stage musical just instead watching it with a bigger budget and more room for the characters to do things. I was thoroughly impressed with Rent and think fans of musicals will love it as well. I also think that fans of the stage musical should also give it a try and see how it was adapted for screen. Like I said I have never seen the stage musical, but I was pleasantly surprised with this film and the fans of the musical may be as well. Because of it's strong story, characters, emotion, songs and power I think that Rent is one of the best films of the year and deserves a second chance from audiences and critics.",Rent

Most of the movie is set in dull or drab settings, the only three that stand out being the train sequence, the tango, and the final scene in the restaurant, but that has more to do with the performers than Columbus. That dank, while realistic, doesn't suit the lively tone of the show. Also, Columbus rushes the scene near the end where Mimi lives again.

45,Isaac5855,Energetic Film Version of the Long Running Broadway Hit,8,10 March 2008,"RENT is the exuberant 2005 film version of the long running Broadway musical that swept the 1997 Tony Awards, which follows an eclectic group of Greenwich Village residents navigating the choppy waters of life that include drug addiction, homelessness, AIDS, commitment phobias, and other realities of life for New Yorkers, as well as the rest of us. The standout element of this musical for me is the amazing musical score by the late Jonathan Larson. The song score for this story is alternately in-your-face and haunting, perfectly blending rich melodies with rapid-fire, almost rap-like patter that brings to mind rock operas like Jesus Christ SUPERSTAR. The talented cast (several from the Broadway show)includes Anthony Rapp as Mark, a documentary filmmaker, Adam Pascal as Roger, a songwriter who falls for a stripper with a heroine addiction named Mimi (Rosario Dawson), Tony Winner Idena Munzel (WICKED) as Maureen, a free-spirited, lesbian performance artist and Tracie Thomas as her new lover, Joanne, and a pair of memorable turns from Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Jesse L, Martin as a drag queen and hustler, both afflicted with AIDS, who fall for each other. Those who only know Martin for his work on NBC's LAW & ORDER will be in for quite the surprise as this role is about as far removed from Lt. Ed Green as you can imagine. Standout musical numbers include the now classic ""Seasons of Love"", ""The Tango Maureen"", ""Take Me or Leave Me"", ""Light My Candle"" and ""Will I Lose My Dignity"", a touching allegory performed at an AIDS support group.

The film scores points for its honesty -- there is no element of debauchery or substance abuse that is hidden to provide clean hands for its protagonists. And the music is comparable to many greats.Unfortunately, the author of the musical died before having a chance to polish it and live on stage it comes across as confusing. The movie version is cleaned up -- thank you! -- so the audience can follow what's going on a little more easily. But there are still nonsensical motivations and the film comes across as a little too sappy.Without spoiling the plot, I can tell you, for example, that having one character with AIDS would have been enough but about half the cast has AIDS. And the protagonists seem to have an immature attitude regarding paying rent and earning money... I think true bohemians revel in art but don't push away money that's earned responsibly. So I failed to completely empathize with the protagonists.Rent is definitely worth seeing but falls short of ultimate greatness. Somehow it's grittier than West Side Story and there aren't even any gang fights! Who should see this film:-- People who love musicals-- Intense liberals who live in urban squallor, and love it-- Anyone who's curious but willing to follow up on the Internet to understand the plot. Similar to an opera maybe you should read a synopsis before seeing this.I'll give ""Rent"" a 7 out of 10.",Rent
48,MichaelMargetis,"""There are times when we're dirt broke, hungry, and freezing, and I ask myself, why the hell am I still living here?"" - Mark Cohen",8,4 December 2005,"Going to see 'Rent', I was very unsure about how it was going to turn out. 'Rent' is my all-time favorite musical and I've seen it four times live. I've listened to the soundtrack and know every lyric in the play by heart. So, I guess by some standards you could consider me one of those ""Rent-Heads"". I wasn't entirely sure if the film would do the Broadway phenomenon justice or flop like crazy. After seeing 'Rent' I was thoroughly satisfied. It was a great film, true to the Broadway musical for the most part but I still think it could have been done a hell of a lot better.'Rent' surrounds the struggle of the poor and unfortunate Bohemians living in New York City in the late 80s to early 90s, many of which have a new but frightfully vicious disease known as the ""Aquired Immune Defiency Syndrome"" (AIDS). First off there are two best friends living together, Roger Davis (Adam Pascal) a failed rock-star with HIV, and Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp) a wannabe documentary filmmaker. Roger falls in love with a AIDS stricken stripper/prostitute, Mimi (Rosario Dawson - Sin City), while Mark has just been dumped by his promiscuous bi-sexual actress/activist girlfriend Maureen (Idina Menzel) who is shacked up with a strong, independent black lesbian female lawyer, Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Then there is Roger, Mark and Maureen's old room mate, Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin - Law & Order), who is a teacher at NYU who also has AIDS, and finds solace with his lover who is an eccentric yet caring drag queen, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Hendria). Then there is Mark, Roger, Mimi, Maureen and Collins' old friend, Benny (Taye Diggs), who once ""had principles"" but is now their land lord threatening to kick them out on the street on their ass.It was wildly entertaining to watch 'Rent' for me because I knew the play so well and it was fun making comparisons. I adored the way they did most musical numbers like 'La Vie Boheme', 'Take Me or Leave Me', 'Rent', 'Out Tonight', 'Today 4 U' and 'Tango: Maureen'. However I didn't care for the way they did others. One of the most powerful and meaningful songs in the entire musical 'Rent' is 'What You Own' a duet by Roger and Mark which was absolutely slaughtered and ended up having the sentiment of a Mentos commercial. They also cut out musical numbers like Goodbye, Love, Happy New Year, Contact and the much important 'Halloween' a beautiful solo sung by Mark. The cast is amazing for the most part with strong performances from Menzel, Hendria and Pascal. Rosario Dawson takes over the part of Mimi well but not nearly as well as the original Mimi (Daphne Rubin-Vega), while the new Joanne, Tracie Thoms, actually does a better job then the original Joanne, (Freddi Walker). For me, Law & Order star Jesse L. Martin stole the show with a searing performance of awesome power that should garner him an Golden Globe Nomination. The only cast member I was disappointed by was Anthony Rapp. He just didn't convert to the screen that well. Chris Colombus does an OK job of directing while the choreography is outstanding.'Rent' isn't a film for everyone. If you don't know the musical, I don't think you'll get it. But for those 'Rent-Heads' this is an absolute must-see. The bottom line is 'Rent' is wildly entertaining and enjoyable, but lacks a few things that could have made it a better film. Grade: B+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 11/26/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",Rent
49,ClaytonDavis,Rent is RENT,7,19 May 2006,"I will try to perform this review as unbiased as I can because I'm a huge Rent fan. Chris Columbus which is best known for films such as ""Stepmom,""""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""Home Alone"" has failed in the task of bringing the very famous adaptation of the Broadway hit to the big screen. I think the problem with the film was the vision that Columbus had for it. There were just too many things missing from the musical: one obviously being some songs that kept the story moving freshly. But don't get me wrong, he did a great job on some aspects: the number one reason was not hiding the fact that this was a musical. The songs were fantastic and have always been, and on the big screen to see them redone was truly a special treat.One other problem was the art direction; the film was shot in San Francisco and never did I feel they were in the Village, NY. Maybe seeing something familiar would keep me in the scene but I kept looking for that one landmark but couldn't locate it. The editing was very good which included lips in sync with words and songs unlike a little film called The Phantom of the Opera. So at least I felt like they were singing the entire time. But enough with the negativity, I'll name some stuff I liked.Rosario Dawson, oh my god! Who'd thought she had in her to pull it off. Girl can sing and she got some moves. Her acting wasn't even half-bad, she was a surprise and a special treat for the film. Being one of the two unoriginal cast members placed a lot of pressure on her but she stepped up to the plate and hit a nice double. I will be expecting to see her in the Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy category at the Globes. Like everyone is talking, the lead actress is so weak we could even see her getting in at Oscars but I don't think they'll allow that. Might as well just go with Zellweger at that point.The rest of the cast is great, ranging from the very funny Idina Menzel whom I had in my supporting actress predictions for the past eight months but reviews are way too mixed for her. Menzel is an up and coming actress and we will see her at Oscars one day soon. (cough cough ""Ask the Dust"") Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp are great co-leads as Mark and Roger along with Tony award winner Wilson Heredia bringing in a great performance as Angel and Taye Diggs as Benny who has a great set of pipes in him. The ""Rent"" boys just don't have the energy nor the fire in them to go to Oscars with these misdirected performances. Tracie Thoms, the other unoriginal cast member, was a good addition but acting is a little on the flat side. We'll wait to see other stuff from her.Well, I guess we're waiting to know who the standout isIt is no less than the magnificent Jesse L. Martin who is best known as Detective Ed Green on ""Law and Order."" This man does not only have a great set of chords on him but he brings you deep into his world and holds you tight there. You feel everything for this man. From his fight with AIDS to his fight with death and loss, you can't help but want to just give him a hug. I'd love to see him as a nominee but I'll be realistic, that unknown name in a mediocre film just won't cut it. I'm sure he'll be a nominee of mine when my best of the year are put together.I really wanted to love ""Rent"" but I couldn't keep my heart in it. There was too much standing around and not enough throwing yourself into your character. ""Rent"" is over 12 years old and these characters are supposed to be in the early 20s and they might not have had the early 20 flavor to grasp their characters anymore. I respect the film for what it was but if you've never seen the show you probably won't like the film that much. Musicals just aren't safe bets at Oscars anymore.",Rent
50,baileycrawly,Another One to Cross Off the List,5,25 March 2021,"Rent is an enigma in movie form. After spending years in development hell, it was finally given the go-ahead... with Chris Columbus of Home Alone 1-3 and Mrs. Doubtfire fame at the helm to direct. That fact alone is enough to deter potential filmgoers from giving this musical much of a buy-in as, while Columbus is a fantastic director in his own right, he's just not the right fit to direct a project like this.
The same can be said for the actors. Every single one of them tackled their roles with everything they had in them, but talent can really only get you so far. That's why casting processes are typically so strict and selective; if you aren't the right person for a part, you're not going to sell that part to an audience no matter how talented you may be. Despite having an addictively enjoyable soundtrack to back it up, most of the actors are in the wrong roles entirely. The film ultimately felt like something rushed together by a studio at risk of losing the film license if it's not released within a certain time frame. The budget is sufficient and the sets themselves are well-done, but the acting, directing and pacing of this film just feel completely off.
There are a handful of genuinely entertaining, heartwarming and gut-wrenching moments in the film, but the majority of the time that you're watching, it's virtually impossible to escape the feeling that the emotion is being forced at you. It doesn't happen naturally; everybody goes out of their way to specifically attempt to trigger certain emotions within the viewer, and it's that kind of desperate ""please-like-us"" energy (most of which probably came from Columbus; the actors themselves were just doing their job) is enough to put a person off the film. It could easily have been trimmed up by about 45 minutes. There are some songs that could easily have been taken out and released as a ""deluxe edition"" soundtrack for the diehard fans.
For the rest of us, at around the 2h15m mark, Rent is a film that tries way too hard, completely tones down the material to the point that it's blatantly pandering to a wider audience than simply fans of musicals. It's paced awkwardly, has moments where it's downright boring and leaves the viewer keeping an eye on the clock. It might be an exaggeration to say watching this felt like 525,600 minutes passing slowly by before our eyes, but it still felt like a damn long time.",Rent
51,moviemanMA,One movie...glory...,8,5 December 2005,"How can you show 525,600 minutes in under two and a half hours? Chris Columbus shows us how and does it with style.In Columbus's rendition of Jonathan Larson's Broadway smash Rent, we are taken back to 1989 in New York City's East Village. We follow eight friends as they try to love, pay rent, and battle AIDS.The movie opens on Christmas Eve and the power has been turned off for roommates Mark (Anthony Rapp, A Beautiful Mind), a passionate filmmaker, and Roger (Adam Pascal, School of Rock), a struggling musician, along with all the other tenants. Their friend Tim (Jesse L. Collins, Law & Order) has just come home and is looking forward to spending the holidays with his friends. After being mugged, a man named Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia)takes care of him for the night. This is the beginning of what would be a very loving, caring relationship, considering they are both HIV+.There are four other main characters introduced. There's the junkie, dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson, Sin City), Benny (Taye Diggs, Chicago) a former tenant who married money and is now the landlord of Mark and Roger's building trying to make a studio. Then there is Maureen (Idina Mendel) who used to go out with Mark but is now, to everyone's surprise, dating Joanne (Tracie Thoms).That night when Mark goes out, Mimi comes upstairs to ask Roger for a ""light"" for her candle, singing ""Light my candle"". Intentionally blowing it out every so often just to stay a little bit longer with him. She is obviously attracted to him, but there is something that tells Roger he shouldn't mess with her. Maybe it is her drug habit, or maybe it is something Roger can't tell her.The next day, Christmas, Angel brings back Tom and is introduced to Mark and Roger. Mark then gets a call from Maureen who needs help with setting up her stage for her next performance at the lot. He has to summon up some courage to face Joanne. The ensuing song is about Maureen's deception and her lies, ""The Maureen Tango"". Still, Joanne won't give into her tricks.As the story unfolds, the group comes together to Maureen's performance and later break out into a captivating song and dance number, ""La Vie Boheme"", a song much like ""We didn't star the fire"". Roger and Mimi confess their love for each other singing ""I should tell you"", a nice duet in the snow covered back alley.The movie is chalk-full of wonderfully choreographed dance numbers and vocals that would make the Three Tenors quiver. Columbus brings back almost the entire cast with the exception of Dawson and Thoms, replacing Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker respectively. The movie itself is a portal to a time when AIDS was gaining more and more attention with the death tole rising. One song in particular, ""Will I?"", sums up the emotions felt by all who have contracted the HIV and AIDS virus.Rent is surprisingly excellent. The cast does a phenomenal job of taking their love for the stage to the big screen. The music is astounding with lyrics that couldn't have been written better. It's not easy taking a musical from the stage to film, but Columbus obviously did his homework and created a fantastic piece of cinema. This year's Rent will be payed in full.",Rent
52,majikstl,This property is condemned...,3,28 November 2005,"RENT opens full throttle with the cast loudly singing to show us that they are intensely angry about something, though just what they are angry about or why they feel compelled to put it into song is never made clear. Indeed, as the film meanders along for over two hours, it never really goes anywhere beyond the usual contrived plot complications about lovers breaking up and getting back together. It is obviously going for a slice-of-life quality, trying to recreate a time and a place, in this case AIDS-era New York, circa 1990. The multi-award winning play is based on Puccini's opera ""La Boheme,"" but the film rather apparently seeks inspiration from the screen version of HAIR. Like HAIR, RENT features a rambling plot that only provides an excuse for the songs; but unlike Milos Foreman's underrated classic, RENT is saddled with rather mundane music and cursed with lackluster staging. Tony awards and a Pulitzer prize notwithstanding, RENT drones from one barely memorable song to the next, trying to be soulfully operatic but revealing its greatest weakness: it's faux operetta can't conceal that it is an utterly trivial story about utterly trivial people. HAIR has the added advantage of being about an era with distinction; the late 1960s were utterly unique in style, attitude and relevancy. Other than taking place at the heart of the AIDS epidemic, there really isn't anything that lends distinction to the milieu that RENT desperately tries to document; 1990 being not that much different from, say, 1975, or for that matter 2005. RENT has the sort of timeless banality that is purposely built into TV sitcoms so that they can play eternally in reruns; if the dialogue didn't mention what year it takes place, it would be difficult to tell. It is certainly difficult to care. The cast repeatedly breaks into one song or another that pointedly celebrates nonconformity, as if such a thing was a unique and original concept. Unfortunately, so much of what the film embraces as being bohemian, seems less shockingly radical than just plain shallow and trendy. What is set forth as originality comes off as cliché, warmed over beatnik and/or hippie counterculture posturing. Rather than being universal in nature, the film's call for freethinking seems strangely generic. If anything, RENT seems geared to do little more than to romanticize poverty and failure. A good example is the character of Mark Cohen, a wannabe filmmaker played by Anthony Rapp. Mark is cursed with a caring, middle-class family and is obviously slumming; the great tragedy he suffers during the course of the story is that he lands a high paying job with a future. Throughout the movie, he is constantly filming some sort of vague documentary about his own life, which prompts him to prattle on about his artistic integrity. To this end he utilizes an old-fashioned, hand-cranked camera, eschewing opportunities to use state-of-the-art equipment, let alone get money to finance his project. The resulting film proves to be little more than an amateurish home movie. He is not an artist; he's a kid playing with a toy. RENT is an ambitious effort about people without ambition, merely kids at play. The roles are tailor-made to safely conform to PC standards of diversity; a carefully balanced quota of blacks, whites, Jews, Latinos, straights, gays, AIDS sufferers, addicts, ""yuppie scum"" and the now almost mandatory free spirit cross-dresser. But it is the type of diversity that is only skin deep; none of the characters stand out as unique individuals; they are diverse for political correctness sake. The characters come together to keep their crumbling tenement building from being torn down, apparently so the characters themselves don't have to actually get on with their inert lives. RENT is a contradictory story that celebrates nonconformity through characters who conform to their common fear of change and growth. The film's milquetoast radicalism extends to its production, which is no more bold or original than its call for nonconformity. Director Chris Columbus makes little effort to experiment in staging or editing the musical numbers; when he isn't obviously copying A CHORUS LINE or HAIR, Columbus gives us an endless array of static shots of characters standing and singing; so much so that the rare inventive moment, such as Rapp and Tracie Thoms nicely doing ""The Maureen Tango,"" seem strangely out of place. Had the film brushed aside its lame story and been more of a musical revue of showstoppers, (like HAIR, or CHICAGO, or GODSPELL or anything by Busby Berkeley or Astaire and Rodgers) then the superficiality of the material would be irrelevant. RENT strives to be neither original nor traditional and ends up not being much of anything.",Rent

It is really horribly directed, the screenplay is one of the worst in years, and ninety percent of the acting is horrible. I can only guess that it works because of the music which is as great as it always was. The music was though affected by some staging that is just plain dumb. I do have to say though that the art direction is amazing and helps some what. The plot was decent in the play and is decent here but is completely ruined by the screenplay as is many other parts of the film.

59,Michael Fargo,How could this have been better?,9,5 December 2005,"I don't know. Given the inherent limitations of transferring a piece written for the stage to screen with the additional problems of this piece (brilliantly conceived by the writer and producers to reflect the grim devastation of pre-protease HIV & AIDS, a time that most have forgotten or suppressed), Columbus deliverswith his castperfection.If you want to argue that the conception of ""real"" streets conflicts with the material, fine. But could you market a film today that was something like Lars Van Trier's (""Dogville"") or Robert Rodriguez' (""Sin City"") for a filmed version of ""Rent""? I don't think so. Columbus plays it safe, but so does the original material.Labeled a ""rock opera"" it clearly is a piece grounded in Broadway tradition. ""Tango Maureen"" and ""Santa Fe"" aren't remotely rock music. But they're wonderful to experience, and Columbus goes straight for the heart of the audience and to the heart of Larson's revered work which mirrored Puccini's heartbreaker.The bold choice of bringing back the original cast pays off. The history of the production deserved giving these actors the chance to preserve their performances. But Rosario Dawson and Traci Thoms both prove that new recruits can be equals. (Not many actresses would agree to ""top"" Idina Menzel's sensational Maureen.) And Ms. Dawson almost runs away with the film.This was a great gift to moviegoers for 2005, and thanks to Chris Columbus and the cast for giving us a near-perfect ""Rent"".",Rent
60,NJMoon,RENT Check,7,23 November 2005,"I'm torn - or should I say rent - about RENT. In ten or twenty years time we'll probably be damn glad that most of the original cast repeated their 1996 Broadway roles for posterity. But as Lucille Ball found out in MAME, it ain't easy to hide a whole decade up there on the big screen. The saving grace is that most of the characters are either ill or starving artists so their haggard faces are an explainable distraction. Still - during the flicks opening number (after the interesting 'prologue' of ""Seasons of Love"") asking ""How we gonna pay last year's rent?"" I felt like shouting ""Uh...a job? Just an idea."" Copying the Broadway costumes for the Broadway cast was a natural, but the sets look like a Hollywood version of Alphabet City - there's that highly cinematic street that (unlike real New York City streets) always ends with a cross street so your view is limited to one (un)tidy block. Production design crams every conceivable space with graffiti, bums, rubbish, shopping carts, smudge pots, and other urban debris just in case we forget where we are. Unfortunately, the lighting is often so dark that we can't see the faces of the performers - perhaps to hide their lipsynching errors.Akin to another New York City-based rock opus - HAIR, director Chris Columbus does fairly well (though he's hardly inspired) with the film's first half, ending with an energetic ""La Vie Boheme"". He stretches his cinematic creativity by inserting a dream sequence into ""Tango Maureen"" and incorporating a lesbian commitment ceremony for ""Leave Me"". Idina Menzel is wicked sexy in her red tango dress, and it helps explain Joanne's infatuation with the performance artist whose ""Over the Moon"" performance is purposely 'over the top'.RENT's second half, however, doesn't fare nearly as well. A mawkish 'illness montage' tracks the downfall of Angel and Mimi without really giving them their dramatic say. Mimi's ET-like resurrection still feels false to me, and on screen it is borderline glib (""Her fever's breaking!""). Roger's visit to Santa Fe feels obligatory. Onstage, when a character checks out of the action for ten minutes, we welcome him back eagerly for the teary finale. On screen, when we have to take the journey with him, it better be worth the trip. He buys a guitar, visits the desert and is on the next bus back to the East Village (another montage, naturally).That said, RENT is full of honest, deep emotion, terrific songs and well-wrought performances. Those who missed the show on stage will be glad (in years to come) to have the performances of the original cast immortalized on screen. Despite it's faults, RENT is well worth paying (a visit).",Rent

63,Hancock_the_Superb,"An Exceptional, Emotional Adaptation of the Musical",9,8 April 2007,"December 24th, 1989, 9 P.M., Eastern Standard Time - New York City's Alphabet City, as a tenement flat is about to be bought by a mega-corporation and its citizens evicted for refusing, or being unable to pay rent. The film involves the efforts of our cast of assorted bohemians and artists to avoid this fate, including: Roger Davis (Adam Pascal), the bitter rock musician who seeks ""one song glory""; Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), the dorky would-be film maker and ex-boyfriend of the flirty bisexual performance artist Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel), who is now with the anal-retentive lawyer Joanne (Tracie Thoms); anarchist philosopher Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) and his transsexual lover Angel Dumont Schunard (Wilson Jermaine Heredia); and the heroin-addicted dancer Mimi (Rosario Dawson), who is in love with Roger. The opposition is Benjamin Coffin III (Taye Diggs), a former friend of these guys who has now ""sold out"" and is working for the enemy. Besides this, many of the characters are also drug addicts and/or AIDS victims, and Maureen's flirtiness unnerves her new girlfriend.I've never seen the original stage version, but I do have the Original Broadway Cast Recording, and quite frankly I'm glad they changed the show as much as they did (no annoying sing-song dialog or ""Voice Mail"" messages). ""Rent-heads"" should accept that great books and plays often have to be changed to be adapted for film, and sometimes it's for the better. Now maybe the stage show is better, but it would not have worked better on film - which is the point.""Rent"" is a show that is all style and relatively little substance - and I mean that in a good way. As a lot of critics pointed out, it's easy to see the lead characters as self-righteous snobs who thinks they're above having to pay rent, but as Sir Thomas More said in ""A Man for All Seasons"": ""To me it has to be, for that's myself."" If you can't recognize that these characters are standing up for their right to be independent and creative, then you've no business watching this show. Now that I've quoted Robert Bolt to defend ""Rent"", I can move on to saying positive things about it.I thought that the film works very well as a traditional-style musical. The songs are re-tooled a bit, but they work just as well, and the film is easier to follow for it. The film also contains a lot of bravura set-pieces which would be nearly impossible on-stage - the opening with the tenants dropping the burning eviction notices out of their windows is a striking sequence, and the scenes featuring ""Over the Moon"" and ""Take Me Or Leave Me"" are beyond the scope of a stage, while the dream sequence during ""Tango Maureen"" is a brilliantly realized number which truly transcends the musical. There is also of course the great ""La Vie Boheme"", superbly recreated here - it's probably the best-written song of the whole lot and it's staged with such energy that it is irresistible. And actually seeing the desolate urban jungle of New York - back alleys, homeless street people, thugs, seedy clubs and bars, as well as Times Square and Central Park - adds to the overall impact of the film.While the cast might be a bit old to play their characters convincingly - well, they're not. All of them are very comfortable in their roles, and work extremely well on screen. It would be hard to single out one actor or actress among the lot for a particularly remarkable performance, though Wilson Jermaine Heredia is probably the best as the cross-dressing Angel - his song-and-dance to ""Today 4 U"" is full of wonderful energy. Newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms both fit into the film brilliantly - Dawson is strikingly beautiful and captures Mimi's desperate energy perfectly, while Thoms' sparring with Idina Menzel's Maureen provides some of the film's best moments. The one thing I would object to is the minimizing of Taye Diggs as Benny, making him almost a cypher character, but that's a comparatively minor complaint.""Rent"" is an excellent movie musical, although I am speaking as one who's not actually seen the stage show. But judged on its own merits, it is a fantastic movie.9/10",Rent
64,jessie-39,The Perfect film! God bless Jonathan Larson,10,27 November 2005,"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.We are 62 year olds and we have been waiting for RENT for 10+ years. We have seen it 4 times on Broadway, in London and in Florida. It is one of our very favorite shows. Most often a Broadway show cannot successfully be transplanted to the screen. This is the exception because of the cast, the editing, the scenery and everything. This is the PERFECT MOVIE. We loved everything about it...every single member of the cast without exception was spectacular. The music is still the best and the story is easily followed with the music of the late Jonathan Larson. He must be looking down on his parents and all of the cast and be thrilled with the reception of his works. What a terrible loss to the world when he died because of the stupidity of some doctors in a NY hospital. We can't say enough and can't wait to see it again and again. There is NO day like today! Their are 525,600 reasons to see it. Be your own critic and don't listen to the nay sayers. If this doesn't get you moving and give you the price of admission times 100 then I don't know what will. God Bless Jonathan Larson.",Rent
65,moutonbear25,Rent: Vacancies Available,6,20 December 2005,"RENT Written by Stephen Chbosky Directed by Chris Columbus I should tell you, I should tell you  I really just don't like ""Rent."" I've tried. I've seen the show. Yes, it was in Toronto and not on Broadway but I still saw it. I bought the soundtrack a good month or so before the release of the film in an attempt to build some excitement. I think I listened to it once, twice tops. And finally this December, amongst a packed house of Rent-Heads, possibly some of the most unstable brand of fans I've ever met, I sat through this directionless film interpretation about a bunch of 20-something aimless artists who would rather starve and freeze then sell out. It may be easier to say this as an artist who is writing this in his cubicle having sold out so he can afford to match his scarf to his hat to his shoes mind you but I still manage to get more accomplished than most of the free-loaders in this film. I originally felt that perhaps my disdain for this show came from some unresolved issues with an ex-boyfriend who was a big Rent-Head. I would always tell people who asked that I did not like the show but followed that up by saying that I had this inevitable ex-boyfriend bias. It feels good to be able to say I simply do not like it now and it helps to know why. From a story perspective, ""Rent"" basically introduces you to a bunch of young artist types and shoves their values down your throat for the first two thirds of the film. Nothing really happens but we know an awful lot about the types of people are singing. You've got singers and filmmakers, dancers and drag street drummers. Some of them have A.I.D.S.; some of them shoot up a fair amount of heroine. Some of them take heroine and have A.I.D.S. What they don't have is depth. The story relies on their plights to provide a deeper meaning but as nothing aside from the looming threat of losing their loft space transpires, you pretty much get the starving for your art thing within the first little bit.""Rent"" makes for a better stage production than a film. It is mostly sung and that can get awkward when choreography is not involved. The stage is a more natural setting for this or at least more so than someone singing directly into the camera while riding their bicycle. In fact, I had my doubts about this translation from the start when it was announced Chris Columbus would be directing. It would be his first project since helming the first two ""Harry Potter"" flicks. I've got nothing against the young magician movies but this is a story of suffering, poverty and despair. I became more hesitant when I learned that the majority of the original Broadway cast would reprise their roles. This is a simple jump from stage to screen for people with experience like Anthony Rapp or Jesse L. Martin but is less successful for say Idina Menzel or Adam Pascal. Pascal plays Roger, a musician who barely leaves the house since his former flame died of AIDS. Rosario Dawson plays his romantic counterpart, Mimi, and mops their filthy loft apartment floor with him because she knows how to play for the camera. It doesn't hurt that she can hold her own in the vocal and dance department. And while on the subject of music, as this is a musical after all, there are certain numbers that pick up the pace of the film, like ""The Tango Maureen"" in it's dream sequence group tango or ""Light my Candle"", a seduction in low light or even ""Take Me or Leave Me"" where a newly engaged lesbian couple square off on accepting the other for who they are. With few other exceptions, the remaining musical numbers often feel tired and repetitive with moments of lyrical genius and reassuring insight that are sadly too few.Columbus tries hard to keep the gritty reality of these artists' lives relevant and convincing but crumbs on floors and duct tape on couches are not enough to ground these characters. The first two thirds of this film are supposed to sell these artists as one big family bound by their convictions but when they are nothing but these convictions, there is little else to hold them together. When actual tragedies start to happen in the last third, they are happening to hollow vessels hiding behind lifestyles and calling it art.",Rent
66,screenwriter-14,"RENT is a ""Life Affirming"" Film Filled With Joy and Pain""",9,26 November 2005,"From the opening scene of RENT with the entire cast on stage as they burst into song is a joyous reminder of CHORUS LINE; but RENT delivers an entirely different story and characters which command your attention and your heart. RENT is a ""life affirming"" film filled with characters that are very real to the world we live in today.Chris Columbus has directed a brilliant film with a cast that is out of this world. The music, sets and the powerful background which is the city of New York, compel you to listen to each character and root for their journeys and to wish that each and everyone will make it past the horror of AIDS. If only that were true. And thus RENT brings home to an audience the diversity of people who have been brought down by AIDS, and the hope that one day a cure may be found.RENT is filled with humor, pathos, love, conflict, fear and the joy of finding someone that you can love with all your heart, no matter the color, nor the sexual preference. I hope that RENT will find a rightful place during Awards season, as this story and cast are truly talented and worthy of an Oscar or Golden Globe.",Rent

This had aids, lgbt people, colored people and more in the show. The character is so diverse. All of the songs they sing in the movie is just the best. There was so many emotional moments that this movie had. It makes you care about each and every character in the movie so when and if they died the character will have a big impact on the story. All of the characters had great friendship, backstories, romance and so on. There was not one thing in this story that wasn't just the best.

69,wavecat13,La Vie Boheme in New York City,4,3 January 2019,"This was a huge hit on Broadway, and there are things to like here. There is of course the poignant story of its main creator, Jonathan Larson, who died the morning of the show's off-Broadway debut. Overall the play celebrates (and is based on the original) La Vie Boheme. Larson's characters - a group of friends - are variously gay, bi, transvestite, infected with AIDS, and hooked on heroin. Some are struggling to make it in the arts. Mark carries around an obsolete hand-cranked Bolex 16 mm film camera, chronicling everything. They are trying to hang onto a crumby squat that their old buddy, now a rich suburbanite (played incongruously by Taye Diggs) is threatening to evict them from. The spectre of death is always nearby. The story never really comes together, and the music is nothing to get excited about. Some of the acting is good - Heredia scores imo. As someone who was there in those days, I can say that this is exagerrated but what do you expect. It is worth a viewing, but not much more.",Rent
70,joestank15,Mixed bag.,5,24 November 2005,"Based on Puccini's La Boheme, tells the story of one year in the life of friends living the Bohemian life in modern day East Village New York. The film has some beautiful choreography and excellent vocals, but in general leads itself to some problems. It's great to hear most of the old cast, and while Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Taye Diggs, and Idina Menzel sound great, they're all too old looking to be reprising their roles. A younger cast of new hopefuls (such as much of the original cast was when they started) might have been a better choice. Most of the songs are very good (One Song Glory, Tango Maureen, ake Me or Leave Me"" and ""La Vie Boheme"" among several) but ""Without You"" could've been cut down to less.And while one of the film's themes (along with AIDs and friendship) is not to sell out, it's a little too hard a lesson to chew, what with the hypocrisy of getting 6 out of the 8 original cast back as one of the selling points of the show. It even starts out with the most widely known song (Seasons of Love) at the beginning of the movie as if to remind us all why we came.There are several touching scenes and montages, but it's Chris Columbus, which means that it'll be a mostly faithful translation, unless things get too offensive. This was okay for Harry Potter, as the first two movies were more kid oriented, but it's just a ""Huh?"" moment here. Where's the shock? The movie tries to play it safe too much. A director not concerned about what kids should or should not see would have been a wiser choice. Hell, why not Spike Lee? Have a documentarian shoot a movie about a documentarian. Awesome idea.There are anacronisms, but I don't care about those. The story pace starts out good, but drags to a crawl near the end. Some dialogue which was originally sung, is now spoken and stilted because of it.In the end Rent die-hards will either love it or hate it. Newbies to Rent will enjoy it because it's a package softened up enough by Chris Columbus to chew.A mixed bag, but I'm thankful that Chris didn't include Joe Pesci, buckets of paint or screaming children, this gets a B.",Rent
71,iguth,It's literally Rent,7,2 June 2019,Rent really is Rent. It truly is just a film adaptation of the musical. The fact that it is film allows for moments that are definitely made more dramatic or more impressive thanks to the magic of cameras. The cast is well picked and have good chemistry together and the filmmaker provides for interesting situations. The music is truly what you would expect from a high quality version of a musical. Generally good musical that fans of Rent should enjoy.,Rent
72,Vampenguin,Powerful,9,23 April 2006,"Life. Love. Death. Drugs. AIDS. This movie is about all that and so much more. Admittedly I wasn't expecting it to be very good, but I was honestly blown away by this film. The actors are phenomenal, the songs are all great, the story is powerful...I loved every minute. Well, actually I guess that last part isn't completely true: this drags pretty bad in the middle. The music starts to sound the same, and nothing interesting happens...but that doesn't last long before a series of events brings the show back to it's glory.

75,movibuf1962,"A little bit of HAIR, a little bit of FAME...",8,12 December 2005,"...and a lot of heart!! Having never seen Jonathan Larson's original stage show, I'm not as well-read on the subtle nuances of the story as others here- nor do I think you absolutely MUST see any stage show predecessor, or READ THE BOOK (as is often commanded) before seeing that movie. RENT's primary appeal for me was- believe it or not- its ensemble story structure. Ensemble stories have multiple and overlapping plots, giving the audience a chance to pick favorite plots as well as characters. (This structure isn't new; it harks back more than 50 years ago when old musicals did it with multiple boy-meets-girl romances.) Because of its string of avant-garde (albeit loving) artisans and bohemians, the film will not appeal to everyone (and I probably will not be sharing how much I loved it with my more conservative acquaintances), but there is a wonderful 'love life regardless' spirit which permeates throughout the show. A stand-out scene revolves around the friends decompressing in a crowded eatery- singing, protesting, literally celebrating LA VIE BOHEME- which not only echoes its operatic predecessor, but also pays homage to the films HAIR, FAME, GODSPELL, daytime soaps, and practically anything by Bob Fosse. I also appreciate the fact that this musical was filmed with a freer, more 'old musical' structure, where the characters are allowed to spontaneously sing or dance without all of reality pausing for an INSERTED fantasy musical number (re: CHICAGO). Everyone is represented here: musicians, dancers, writers, filmmakers, performance artists, drag queens, addicts, dealers, pretenders, yuppies, square pegs, and ill winds. And an extra bonus lies in the fact much of the cast is retained from the original Broadway cast (something which especially impresses me). But it reads like an actual movie and not a filmed stage play. Thank heavens for that! One last note: Before seeing RENT on film, I only knew Jesse Martin from LAW & ORDER as a rather laid-back detective. Who knew the man could sing and dance- and with the most intense joy in the world?!",Rent
76,wandereramor,No day but today...,8,24 April 2012,"Maybe it's bad of me as a critic, but there's something about this movie and the musical it's based on that hacks past all my cynical defences and really gets to me. There's something about the vision of apocalyptic hope it carries, an untainted 60s counterculture optimism coming through the turbulent 70s and 80s dingier but basically unscathed. Rent is kind of rare in its ability to present darkness and light together without either outshining the other.Oh, and the music is good too. Too often in a musical all the songs kind of blur into a generic mass of sung dialogue, but here they all have their own discrete identities and purpose. And they actually sound good, almost like something you would listen to outside the contexts of the story.Chris Columbus is not a great director, but he mostly stays out of the way of his material here, and was smart enough to use (mostly) the original cast. From a cinema-snob perspective Rent is a very flawed film -- the third act, for instance, is way too rushed. And it's unabashedly sentimental, so those who generally think of musicals as fountains of cheese are advised to stay away. But it has a kind of power to make that sentiment seem real and earned, and that's something you don't see everyday.",Rent
77,GMJames,A tough call (2013 update),6,10 December 2005,"I've never seen ""Rent"" on Broadway or the road show versions though I have enjoyed listening to the song ""Seasons of Love"". I walked in the movie theater just like I usually do for any movie: I want to be entertained and maybe even moved. ""Rent"" was a mixed bag. The film had some flaws but it was not a complete failure.Some of the performances were very moving especially original cast members Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel and Jesse L. Martin as Tom. I was very surprised by the performance of Rosario Dawson as Mimi. Her previous roles in some badly-reviewed movies, including Josie and the Pussycats, The Adventures of Pluto Nash and Alexander, did not prepare me for her electrifying performance as the dancer who falls in love with one of her neighbors.As much as it was nice to see many actors from the original stage production, and impressed with the passion of the actors and director Chris Columbus' choice of camera shots and his generally assured hand, I wonder if ""Rent"" would have been better movie if it was not too slick. Would it have been more impressive if they used unknown actors? What about a hand-held, documentary-style musical instead of the standard studio crane shots? (It was a bit annoying for me to pay more attention to the CGI effects of the actors' cold breaths while singing instead of listening to what song they were singing.) While watching ""Rent"", I think of other movie musicals that have originated from the stage and how difficult it is to adapt for the big screen. I think the success/failure ratio is not very good. Arguably, for every ""Chicago"", and ""Cabaret"", there are the well-intentioned mixed bags like ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" and ""Godspell"", the cult successes like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and outright flops like ""A Chorus Line"" and ""Man of La Mancha"". I think ""Rent"" belongs in the mixed bag/cult success area.Update 2013: For what it's worth, my suspicions on the stage version of ""Rent"" being better that the movie version was confirmed after watching an energetic, live performance at Seattle's 5th Avenue Theatre in the summer of 2012.",Rent
78,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review -- good but not great,7,27 November 2005,"If you were in choir or had any interest at all in musical theater in the latter half of the 1990s, you knew Rent or at least the Act II opening number, ""Seasons of Love."" Nine years since it's Broadway debut, Rent has finally come to a theater near you. The film version of the Tony Award-winning musical is extremely loyal to the original show  almost to a fault. Six of the eight main actors in the movie were in the 1996 Original Broadway Cast. Costumes, down to Mark's stripped scarf and Angel's Santa coat were exactly like the ones worn in the play. The music was sung exactly like the original cast soundtrack. Why did they even bother trying to make this into a film when they could have saved a lot of time just by filming the play live on stage? For those who have never seen the play live on stage, Rent is the story of a group of friends in New York City in the early 90s, dealing with poverty, homelessness, sexuality, drugs, and AIDS. Even though most the music is upbeat and fun, it's really a sad, dark, and edgy story. And that's what I was hoping for from the movie. I was hoping to see the true pain and devastation of these social misfits. Instead, the movie is just as slaphappy and perky as the play. I blame a lot of this on the director, Chris Columbus. For some reason, the director of Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone, and the first two Harry Potter movies was chosen to direct Rent, a movie where a gay man watches his transvestite lover slowly die of AIDS.But maybe the studio wanted a ""family-friendly"" director who would keep the tone of the movie just as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as the Broadway show and not risk making Rent too edgy or controversial. This way it's more appealing to a wider audience and no one is offended. If that is what they wanted, mission accomplished. Bottom line, if you like the music from the original play, you'll like the movie. Just don't expect anything more.",Rent
79,flickershows,"Great, It's 2+ Hours Of Whiny Singing",4,15 August 2006,"So this is Rent, huh? Yowzers, what a ridiculous snoozer. And here I thought Angels In America was an indulgent, dripping waste of time. Anything with the scrumptious and sassy Rosario Dawson in it has a fighting chance, but even Rosario gets steamrolled by the depressing subject matter. If they insisted on turning the infamous Broadway play into a movie, they should have done it sooner. AIDS and poverty are always worthy topics, of course. It just feels like this movie is about 15 years late for the prom.I've wasted countless hours watching bad movies, but I never thought this one would be such an utter mess. And watching it seemed to take countless hours too. Then again, maybe that shouldn't come as a surprise. This IS a musical and musicals are a touchy subject, particularly when they're directed by a notable hamfister like Chris Columbus. The everybody-sings-at-the-drop-of-a-needle premise makes a story seem fake at the best of times, and Rent was in dire need of more authenticity. All this movie accomplished was make me reach for the laptop and start surfing anyway. Anything to provide a distraction from all the the melodramatic caterwauling and whining.Besides, those South Park guys lampooned the Rent stage production so memorably with their ""Everyone Has AIDS"" song in Team America. It's hard to take this stuff seriously after puppets have mocked it.",Rent
80,Pasafist,"a film so pointless, so banal, you'll ask for the two and half hours back",2,28 November 2005,"RENT the film works for exactly four minutes. The opening credits role and then the cast sings 521,600 Minutes and its all downhill from there. What follows a nice opening is a film so pointless, so banal, you'll ask as my wife did for the two and half hours back you spent watching RENT.I remember when RENT opened on Broadway. I remember I had a buddy who camped out on the street to see the play. I remember people called RENTheads would record the shows in other cities and trade bad audio and video of the off Broadway productions starring Molly Ringwald and Doogie Howser. It was a phenomenon based on the tragic death of it's creator Jonathon Larson more than a well made show, and so the play stayed untouched, unfiddled around with, for who would dare touch the Genius of Larson? Who would dare walk on his grave? If I were the director of this movie I would have begged for a rewrite. If ever there was a film dying for some heart, some central core, its RENT. It's jumbled, it's messy, it contains characters that don't mesh, there's no coherence, no one worth rooting for, no one worth hating, and that's wrong. The passion and drive of the clunky play may work as live theater, heck CATS works as live theater, but RENT is charmless, pointless, and murky and it really shouldn't be.RENT follows the exploits ""in the year of the life"" of Mark (Anthony Rapp) the angst ridden film maker, Roger (Adam Pascal) the Rockstar with AIDS, Mimi (Rosario Dawson) the heroin addicted Stripper with a heart of gold (and AIDS), Tom (Jesse L. Martin) the unemployed professor with AIDS, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) the Drag Queen (with AIDS) who steals Tom's heart, Maureen (Idina Menzel) the performance artist and Mark's Ex-Girlfriend, and Joanne (Tracie Thomas) the Lawyer who falls in love with Maureen. They are the bohemians, they can't pay the rent, they can't pay the heat, and everyday they stand the chance of being evicted. So they sing. They sing a lot, and at one point at a protest, they Moo. That causes a near riot. I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because I didn't want to be mean to the rest of people in the theater. But I had a feeling they were watching a different movie cause they kept clapping.Why was this film so joyless? Why were the main characters so whiny? Why does RENT have no real heart? The film just assumes that we the audience will like these people and so it makes no attempt to allow them to win our hearts. It assumes that because the script has introduced us to them that they are friends. But half the film revolves around how these people don't get along. They are disgruntled about life and yet the film praises that fact and instead of doing anything about it they whine. They hate progress, they protest the idea of personal responsibility, and fight the man, for what? Nothing but a crappy apartment in New York City.The most honest moment in the film comes when the Mark films a homeless women who was being harassed by the cops. The homeless women look at him and screams something like ""don't exploit me, get a job."" These people are not happy, the lifestyle they promote is pointless and the film fails to take a stand on any of it.The film also doesn't work on a purely technical level. The dialog clunks haphazardly into the songs. The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off, and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater. But you'll have 521,600 minutes attacking you in your dreams. If the screenplay would have been retooled to fit the screen instead of the screen trying to replicate the stage a better movie would have emerged. But RENT will appeal only to those who love the play.The other glaring problem is the actors seem too old to embody these parts. With actors culled from the original off-Broadway cast, it casts and even deeper gloom over the film. We all have to grow up, this group of 30-somethings edge on pathetic. A new cast of twenty-somethings would have worked a bit better.So save your money. You thank me I promise.",Rent

82,divaclv,"Falling a bit short on ""Rent""",7,23 November 2005,"The movie version of ""Rent"" is neither as bad as it might have been, nor as good as one would hope. It's a film that flirts with greatness, and may actually achieve it in some places, but can never seem to do so with any consistency.Jonathan Larson's musical, an update of ""La Boheme,"" is basically a series of vignettes that follows a year in the lives of several starving artists and rebels, living in the face of poverty and AIDS and trying to avoid selling out to corporate conformity--which, if you were a college kid in the late 90s when ""Rent"" premiered, really did feel like the worst thing that could happen to you. Of course, much worse befell the world on other end of the millennium, and in 2005 the material feels almost innocent in spite of the alternative lifestyles and seedy living. But the cast knows how to sell it, and well they should: six of the eight principal players originated their roles on Broadway. (The newcomers, Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, fit into the group seamlessly) This means, of course, that they are no longer the fresh young faces they were back then (Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs have carved out screen careers; Idina Menzel has a Tony award), but frankly this doesn't bother me much. I'd rather watch this group of talented performers play a little under their age than suffer Brittney Spears or Justin Timberlake--or any wannabe clones thereof--any day.It goes without saying that the cast knows how to give a song dramatic impact, and when director Chris Columbus gives them the tools to do their job, ""Rent"" is very good indeed. ""Out Tonight,"" the exotic dancer Mimi's (Dawson) call to the nightlife, carries the right balance of liberated joy and desperate longing. A duet where filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) and lawyer Joanne (Thoms) lament being wrapped around the fingers of bisexual flirt Maureen (Menzel) is staged and performed effectively, and segues into a delightful dream-sequence tango. And when one of the central group of friends succumbs to AIDS, the resulting memorial service is every bit as moving as it should be.Unfortunately, Columbus doesn't always know how to channel the talents of his cast. For example, there's the non-conformist anthem ""La Vie Boheme,"" in which a gathering of the young and rebellious celebrate a life of ""going against the grain, going insane, going mad"" and ""being an 'us' for once, instead of a 'them'."" If ever there was a song in music theater that begged for high-energy, kinetic camera work, it is this one. Yet Columbus films it in static shots and slow pans, which almost deaden the energy from the cast--there's just so much dancing on tables that one can take before it starts to feel stale. At other times, Columbus makes the same mistake Joel Schumacher did in ""Phantom of the Opera"" of having movement without purpose. Mimi and Roger (Adam Pascal) step out into an alleyway to share a love duet. They stand and sing for a while, move a few steps down the alley, stand and sing again, then walk back. Why did they move at all?

83,crowrobot,Brilliant for about 90 minutes...,8,28 May 2007,"For about 90 minutes, the film adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical 'Rent' is brilliant: a heedless, vibrant celebration of joy, film, and music. The film stumbles in the final hurdle, though I still enjoy the final product wholeheartedly.I have never seen the Broadway show, so I was taken aback by the sheer energy of the story. With about 75% of its main characters homosexual and/or HIV-positive, I was expecting something more somber or moody. The songs are more rock-and-roll than typical Broadway numbers, and the screen practically bursts with joy and color at certain points. While most of the cast is comprised of the original 1996 Broadway players (the best of whom are Jesse L. Martin and Anthony Rapp; Martin's energy makes up for his visible age, while Rapp is convincing as both a character and a young bohemian) the best actors are two new ones: Rosario Dawson, one of the loveliest women in Hollywood, lights up the screen as Mimi, while Tracie Thoms brings dignity and gravitas to her role as Joanne.Chris Columbus, the director of such commercial films as the first two Harry Potters, Mrs. Doubtfire, and Home Alone, is probably not the first person you would think of to take on this material successfully. But Columbus does a good job, utilizing the more expansive spaces of film for some truly effective sequences.I do have a few problems with the actual material. Maureen (Idina Menzel) is a character that is written as such an unlikeable shrew that it becomes extremely hard to like her. The character of Angel is too much of a caricature, and Benny, though played well by Taye Diggs, is a plot device. And while there are some true show-stopping songs in the movie (""Seasons of Love"", ""Rent"", ""La Vie Boheme"", ""The Tango Maureen""), there are some lackluster songs as well.The energy drains from the film in the final stretch and gives way to turgid melodrama; I like melodrama if it is done well, which is not the case here, although the ending is very effective. 'Rent' is still a highly enjoyable, energized experience that offers a break from typical Broadway musical styles.",Rent
84,cwrdlylyn,"RENT : Not Necessarily Bad, But A Hugely Disappointing Adaptation Of Great Material....",6,29 November 2005,"RENT This is a film which I am thrilled to have gone in with such low expectations for b/c despite it's many flaws... the film was better than I anticipated.No matter how unoriginal, and uninspired Chris Columbus' direction could be... the film still came off as professionally (if not creatively) put together. Also, no amount of boring direction was able to dilute the sheer energy that some of this music just radiates.Another main problem I was worried about was that I would constantly be bothered by the age of the actors. Well... I wasn't. Turns out by not making note of any of their ages at all, it really wasn't a factor.Although I think that it would have been more appealing to me to see more unique and new character interpretations captured on film, many of the performers really stepped up to the plate in this film. Strongest of the returning cast was probably Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel (though Oscar buzz for these performances is absolutely over-the-top and ridiculous to me)... Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Jesse Martin were fine, but there were many moments when they started to annoy me with their constant over-the-top smiling and giddiness (I suppose it fit their characters, but the extremity of it seemed better suited for the stage)... Adam Pascal however shouldn't expect much of a film acting career, there was nothing going on there.The two best performances though came from the newbies Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson. Perhaps it was hearing fresh takes on the roles that made the performances seem stronger, or maybe they were just more capable performers. To me though, these two were the constant highlight.However, despite being able to entertain and surprise me... there are still a handful of faults to this film.1.) Seasons Of Love - While it worked as an opening, in the long run of the film, this number was just an obvious example of Chris Columbus not knowing how to film RENT's most famous song. I think the performer's on the stage was masked to look like an interesting choice... but it had no validation to me and just seemed like Columbus couldn't figure anything out besides shoving them on-stage and having them sing to an empty theatre (and BTW, if you are going to do this Chris, make sure half your performers aren't looking at 1 spot while the other halve's eyes are constantly moving) 2.) These characters are annoying. At many points, especially LA VIE BOHEME I started to ask myself, why should I like these characters? Yes life is hard, it's terrible the diseases and addictions affecting the lives of these friends... but in the end, what the heck entitles them to run about screaming in a restaurant the fact that they feel they don't need to pay rent or apologize for smoking weed in public and not paying for their food. Yes life's hard people... but that doesn't entitle you to rebel against everything.3.) Nothing truly interesting was done with the piece. Yes, we saw Roger's girlfriend, but did we REALLY see anything we didn't already know. I just feel like there was soooooo much more potential to ADD to the stage show through a screen transfer, and instead, it just adequately represents the same show that's playing every night in New York... there just wasn't enough to make it truly interesting or important.4.) A film that has many important messages about drugs, sexuality, acceptance, disease, and living in NYC was allowed to become little more than a story of a few friends who just really love each other... and none of the important messages where given prominence.Overall, the film surprised me with how fluffy and harmlessly enjoyable it is. But at the same time, I couldn't help feeling that RENT should have never been a harmlessly enjoyable film... it could have been so much more. And that is the biggest disappointment for me.... C ...",Rent

I'm also aware that Chris Columbus is not an exciting, innovative director, and that certainly shows in the film: had Rob Marshall or Baz Luhrman would certainly have made a more pulsating film.And that is the problem with the film: it has a tired feel to it; the performances are ""safe"", rather than good or sparkling. Although many 'goofs' are listed on the site, these didn't detract from the staging of the film... it was a film that engaged me in a limited way, but not a film I would trash.It's no Moulin Rouge, Chicago, Cabaret or West Side Story but it is a film worth seeing, particularly for those in countries where it has not been staged.",Rent

It has quickly joined my list with Crash, Hustle and Flow, Pride and Predjustice and now Rent for front runners for movie of the year! Rentheads you're gonna love this film! The movie opened with a tribute to the stage musical. They performed ""Seaons of Love"" to the individual spots on a bare stage to an empty theatre. This opening sets the pace for the movie.The movie remained true to the passion and emotions felt in the Broadway musical. Director Chris Columbus chose to put some songs in a different order, but I think that worked with the way the story was told.The movie has laughter, passion, romance, love, friendship, and family all wrapped around this group of friends and lovers. In 2005 the message of aids awareness and substance abuse is still powerful. I heard many critics say that the material was dated and not relevant to a new generation,but I think they are wrong. You really connect to the characters in this film and you care about what is going to happen to each of them. Even as the film ended I wanted more and I think Larson would have been proud.The movie theater I was in was filled with people of all ages and I think this message of Love and Unity transcends through the powerful music and masterful storytelling of Chris Columbus screen concept of rent. The backdrop of the movie was a gritty New York and the new approach to the music fit the film perfectly.This movie is worthy of an Oscar.

87,sourapple,RENT - a beautiful mess,10,2 March 2006,"The movie RENT is better heard than seen. I am a fan of the musical (although not yet deserving to be called a RENThead since I haven't seen the actual stage production) and I loved the new recording they did for the movie. So I'm going to refer to Rent (2005) as ""the movie"" and the musical as RENT :) I didn't like how the scenes were slightly choppy and some of the musical numbers in the movie had a corny ""music video"" feel (What You Own), unlike other musical to movies like Chicago. The movie gives off the feeling of a copy-paste version of the Broadway production. I am only basing this from the original Broadway cast recording, since I've never seen it on stage.The movie also became somewhat comical because most of the lines in the movie were originally sung in the obc recording. So I kind of guessed what they were going to say next. The least they could've done was change the lines.In my honest opinion, I think it's the fault of Chris Columbus (as usual). He ruined Harry Potter by staying too faithful to the book. He also ruined RENT for also staying too faithful to the musical. I love that he didn't cut a lot of songs from the actual musical, but overall the movie was a slight mess. Baz Luhrmann or Rob Marshall could've done a better job than this guy, hey, even that guy who directed The Phantom of the Opera would've been a good choice.Chris Columbus doesn't have the artist in him to make a good film. He failed to capture any of the emotions RENT has. Columbus should stay away from material that he doesn't have a clue on. He should stick to his usual formula of Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire.But hey, I enjoyed it because I *finally* saw the movie! And it was fun seeing the original actors perform as if I was watching them on stage. Pascal, Rapp, Martin, Thoms, Menzel, Diggs (character was not developed that much), Heredia and Dawson were a great cast. However, they were overshadowed by an awful director.No day but today!",Rent
88,Surecure,Probably worked better on stage...,6,27 November 2005,"I am not a die-hard musicals person. I do love musicals when they are done right, but I don't go out of my way to see every big musical. The same would go for movie- musicals. However, when they are done right, I find myself enjoying them immensely, whether they be the Sound of Music or Chicago.Rent is one of those films that I really wanted to say I enjoyed completely. It has many things going for it, from very intelligently composed songs to some fantastic performances. However, I feel that this is one musical that probably works a whole heck of a lot better on stage than it does on the silver screen. It probably doesn't help that several key pieces were omitted from this translation, but I can't exactly forgive a film for trying to be shorter.Jesse L Martin, Tracie Thoms and Wilson Jermaine Heredia certainly shine in their performances, eclipsing the other performances that are solid but not quite as effective. I would even go so far as to say that Jesse L Martin could be an Oscar hopeful for the range he brings to this role. The other performances are all noteworthy, and all the right notes are hit (pardon the pun).However, I feel that the disjointed flow of the pieces is a result solely of Chris Columbus' direction and Steve Chbosky's writing. While each's work is strong at times, the unfortunate truth is that the parts that are lacking really bog the film down. Certainly opening up select scenes would have improved the pacing and the clarity of the interweaving stories. However, in the end it is obvious that time was of greater concern than clarity, which is truly unfortunate.About a 6.5 out of 10 overall. Great performances, weak direction.",Rent

""Measuring their loves in love,"" these starving artists strive for success and acceptance while enduring the obstacles of poverty, illness and the AIDS epidemic. It stars Rosario Dawson,Taye Diggs and Wilson Jermaine Heredia.To be honest, I haven't seen the play nor did I have any interest when the movie first came out. But I understood everything that was going on. I had no idea what the movie was actually about until I watched, but there was something wrong with the plot itself. If this movie is a bout a group of people wanting to pay their rent, then what are they exactly doing? 70% of this movie is all singing and the rest is acting and a story, I might add. There were a few boring scenes and I felt that I wanted the movie to be over because the running time is awfully long. It doesn't necessarily have to be 2 hrs and 15 mins. I heard that this was the longest play or something, so I don't know.Maybe all the people who loved the play will indeed like this movie, but to the people who know nothing about this movie may not want to watch it. I just looked at it as a normal movie, I haven't seen the play but that isn't the reason why I'm giving it a low score. I'm just looking at it as a normal movie.

Now, I've said before that I have no problem with happy fluffy tales of little substance as a rule, but what I CANNOT stand is a film puffing itself up with a grand show of self-importance when it does nothing more substantial than whine (oh, how they whine!) about how unfair life is.Each character reeks of the same delusions of greatness, especially the ""inspired"" struggling filmmaker who believes he'll give himself meaning by recording everything with a camera that really belongs in a museum. And as far as the whole premise of paying the rent goes- who the heck really cares? Am I supposed to feel sympathy for these lost little souls that are so unjustly being charged a fee for a living space, therefore taking away money from their useless films and heroin addictions? Tragedy, indeed! What is the world coming to, where the unrealized geniuses cannot simply loaf around all day for free?? And nobody provided a good enough reason, not even a freakin decent personality to inspire any amount of sympathy for them.The film simply assumes because they have a terminal disease (brought on by their own choices) or are the black sheep of society or are creative (in the loosest sense of the word) they are the champions of humanity.

92,myspecialparadise,Love It!,8,22 February 2014,"Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Jessie Martin steal the show, especially Wilson as the ever caring Angel ... the name suited the character perfectly, and Wilson's act was just as flawless! The only part of this movie that I hated was Idina Menzel's solo performance at Maureen's protest performance in the night ... the entire number was a waste of film, and I usually fast forward passed that portion of the film ... as her number at the engagement party was far better, I must assume the scripting was at fault ... that night performance was like nail on a blackboard for me ... like ... jump over the moon already! Quite the lame production.The opening of the film is reminiscent of Chorus Line ... but sort of a waste of talent as not all the characters had even met yet ... so I think, that production would have better placed elsewhere in the movie.The acting is superb on all counts ... as is the singing. There were a few obviously mistakes in filming ... like when our two main characters are walking through the village singing about them moving in together, a great number by the way ... the pass two policemen ... one black and one white, approach them, but they seem to become two white cops after they pass the couple. The subway routine was obviously shot in many takes as some of the scene were not cut properly, and just didn't match up.However, when you take everything into consideration ... including Rosario Dawson's night club act which was totally outrageous and wonderful ... that whole section of the film is a well cut gem! Also need to note that Tracie Thoms' part in the film was just as great as the top two that stole the show! I do have one complaint ... why does it seem that these movies seem to always kill off the drag queen? Granted, they do make them out to be really wonderful people ... but they kill them all off ... makes no sense. Perhaps the writers are trying their best to make the world more acceptable to trans-genders? I can accept that ... I've met good and bad ones, just like every other category of human beings!

Numbers from the late Jonathan Larson's poppy score serve as the backdrop for the crazy, colorful song and dance explosions, all beautifully photographed by Stephen Goldblatt. Many musical have songs that inspire you to stand up and cheer...""Rent"" does more than that. These numbers sweep you off the ground in a torrent of emotion.

96,mswatsoninc,"Overdue ""Rent"" Has Late Fee",4,27 January 2007,"I have often said, as someone who saw the stage production when it first hit the scene in '96, that the back story of ""Rent"" is far more impressive than the actual product. Johnathan Larson's premature demise on the eve of its Broadway opening is the kind of story that will make someone want to go see his opus out of homage if not necessarily curiosity. It's that same homage that will squint a critical eye when it comes to placing harsh judgment on the actual show itself. A modern day telling of ""La Boheme,"" ""Rent"" has never ceased to baffle me with its popularity. At the end of the day, it was a cacophony of loud music that didn't pull me inside its spell...I found it average at best.That being said, one bored night at home, I thought I'd give ""Rent"" another chance when I saw it on Comcast's Video on Demand. There was the original cast, save Tracie Thoms (Joanne) and Rosario Dawson (Mimi), back in their familiar roles--looking every bit the nine years older that they were. These 30-somethings playing 20-somethings turned out to be the only saving grace this stage to screen experience had to offer. A totally new cast across the board would have really made the experience even more painful to sit through than it turned out to be.No longer taking on its opera-esquire format, ""Rent"" opts instead to add dialog in between its rock ballads and production numbers. The choice to do that, I might add, made me not like songs from the original score as much as I did when I first saw it on stage, and made me truly hate songs I didn't much care for to begin with, either. It also hammered home my one complaint with the stage version--there is far too much musical repetition in ""Rent."" How many times can one endure ""No Day But Today,"" or any derivation of it? Not many, I'm afraid.Painfully, I watched as Adam Pascal (Roger), Anthony Rapp (Mark), Wilson Jermaine Heredia (Angel), and company over emoted banal dialog to get them to the next song. Fairing no better, Idina Menzel (Maureen) and Thoms weren't convincing with simple biology, let alone in their task at trying to convince viewers there was any sort of chemistry between them. I also found Jesse L. Martin (Tom Collins) to be a smiley one note, and his interaction with Heredia didn't survive the transfer to celluloid, which was the only interesting relationship I felt the stage version had to offer.While Thoms--with all her disadvantages--managed to fit as well as could be expected into the ""fish out of water"" ensemble, Rosario Dawson's Mimi stuck out like the sorest of thumbs. There was nothing convincing about the group's fondness for her, and it made me miss Daphne Rubin Vega (the original Mimi) more than I thought I would ever be capable of noticing her absence. Ironically, her delivery of ""it's a living"" in the forgettable ""Light my Candle"" was funny...see how far I'm stretching to compliment something? If you're a die hard ""Rent""-head, you'll probably be overjoyed or offended with what they've done with the musical, depending on just how big of a fanatic you rate yourself. If you're like me and wasn't blown away by the stage version, the movie isn't going to do you any favors as far as your opinion goes.",Rent
97,druss44121-1,very good says this man who despises musicals,9,23 November 2005,"From the award winning Broadway musical from Jonathon Larson, Rent makes its big screen debut and it is not likely to disappoint many fans.Better yet, it may even create some new ones.Part of what made Rent so popular and defining for the 90s was that it mixed the glitz and glamour of Broadway with the grittiness of modern times. It had themes involving AIDS, sexuality, and the contemporary frustrated artist.The movie, in turn, successfully manages to balance the stagy showiness of Broadway with the distinctive scope of cinema. While often plays and musicals find a poor translation to the big screen, Rent succeeds partly because it never forgets that it is a Broadway musical.It begins with all the main characters lined up, on a stage, singing. Yet, it then becomes irrevocably cinematic as we are whisked to the streets of a wintry New York in turmoil.The cinematography is especially beautiful, as shadows slowly reveal color in an environment that is New York as it can only be seen through interpretation.Now, there are a ton of songs.The play itself is all singing, and the movie follows close to this. It feels like there are about 50 songs, and to be fair around the middle some of the tunes begin to blend together and sometimes it seems like a song hardly ends before another one has began.However, by the end this concern disappears, and the lyrics and dialogue in particular are clever and layered with meaning.It is a wonder that the actors can memorize all of it when on stage.In fact, part of what makes Rent so authentic is the fact that many of the actors here are the actors from the original Broadway play, so there is already a strong bond between them that is very evident. Their energy simply radiates off the screen.It also helps that they can sing, as this is something that can cripple some musicals (Phantom of the Opera anyone?) One of the more surprising things about Rent, though, is the direction.Usually director Chris Columbus (he did the first two Harry Potter films) is a very by the numbers and painfully average director. However, here it seems he may be maturing a bit, exploring more of what he can do with his camera and the medium he is using.It is also evident that he feels passion for this material, as does everyone else involved with this project.Also, somewhat humorous is that this is a film from 1492 Productions and directed by none other than a man named Christopher Columbus.Thankfully the film itself is also full of purposeful ironies that ensure that not every detail can be picked up in just one showing.While near the end Rent does dabble heavily in the sentimental and the melodramatic, it rarely loses its edge or becomes overly sappy. This is a gritty story that doesn't necessarily end in a song and a dance, as it were.Rent ends on the perfect moment, the perfect image. It captures an important character without any superficial razzle-dazzle, letting all the emotions of the entire story filter through in that single, defining moment.This is part of what ultimately makes Rent successful as a film, as a musical and as an adaptation. While sometimes it does hit a musical overload (though this is also part of its appeal), it is still able to create some true emotion while delivering a message that we have both heard too many times and yet not enough.When it came out in the 1990s Jonathon Larson hit a nerve with his very frank look at AIDS, sexuality, and despair mixed with hope.While some of these issues have become much more mainstreamed and known with time, they are still issues we face today. AIDS is very much a problem without a solution, and more importantly the way some people find themselves treated for not fitting the norm can be appalling.Yet, we can still find a way to bond together.Rent never forgets what it is, and doesn't compromise the still somewhat controversial message it carries for that last unneeded bit of glitz.Critic's Conclusion: If you are a fan of the musical you will most assuredly very much enjoy this, but even if you are not Rent offers a lot of entertainment along with a lot of to chew on.",Rent
98,sharkey197,"Thank you, Chris Columbus",9,15 January 2007,"I never saw Rent onstage, but as a teacher of high school students was well aware of the complete fanatical devotion to this piece of theatre that was almost universal. My critical viewing classes expressed interest in seeing it when we did movie musicals, so I decided to screen it as a possible candidate.My background is musical theatre and I am well aware of the difficulty in transferring a stage show like this to film, with all the inherent unbelievability that might occur. But I have to say that his film moved me, excited me, inspired me and certainly made me realize why it is so appealing to the younger audiences.I think that Columbus is so underrated as a director. The choices he made in bringing this to the screen--no the least of which is casting the original actors when possible--show a real feel for the material and a respect for the intent. Who cares that they are not the right age? You simply don't care because you become involved with their stories. He also makes the whole situation, bursting into song seem completely normal and if you can't accept it, maybe musicals just aren't your thing. I thought it was visually exciting as well, but he also knows how to just let the camera roll so we get continuous takes which let the action unfold.Why are so many people dissing this film and his direction? What does Chris Columbus have to do to prove he's a good director? His Harry Potter movies were blockbusters, but he's criticized for sticking too close to the books. Home Alone was a blockbuster, but it's not taken seriously because it's just a fun film. The truth is this director knows how to involve his audience in stories, which is a wonderful gift. I also think whatever he toned down to get his PG-13 rating was probably the right decision. This is a film that young people should see. It still has plenty of grit and seaminess and whoever calls it dated--excuse me, are people not dying of AIDS anymore? Is drug use over? Do people of different sexual orientations now have complete acceptance? No? Well, then, I guess it's not that dated after all.In conclusion, I must say that even though I loved the film, the music, the story and everything about it, there is a generational gap, because I couldn't help thinking, ""why don't you guys get a job, a mortgage, etc?"" That's why this film is so much a symbol of the youth, of any era. It articulates their voice.,",Rent

My eldest sister has an $800.00 a day cocaine habit, not to mention my eldest daughter loves synthetics & my former brother in law died from an overdose just this past spring.I would like to have seen the movie focus more on solutions than just talking about drug use. In reality Mimi would not have revived, she would be dead from overdose & AIDS would not have taken Angel out so easily either.There are many more treatment options for AIDS now in the 2000's than ever before, for drug overdose Narcan is pretty much the only top lifesaver.

101,RoboSlater,"This is No ""La Boheme"" -- that's for sure",2,23 November 2005,"My quick notes after viewing ""Rent"": Although the singing is sometimes outstanding, the music itself is average. Looking for a good, rousing, upbeat time? The three major characters are dying of AIDS. Gee, giddy and goosebumply already. It is based -- so they say -- on the beautiful, heart-wrenching dramatic opera, Puccini's ""La Boheme"", so you would think it's has attributes of that classic. You would think so, but it doesn't.The ending is about 50 times inferior to the ending of that great opera. Warning: It should be an R for its drugs and drag queens, but it was generously given a PG-13 by liberal Hollywood and, in my humble opinion, as demanded by the European money that funded it just as Europe funds 70% of all U.S. films released into general distribution this year. In short, another ""out-of-touch"" message movie that the mainstream will wisely avoid but the insular community of Hollywood will likely give an Award to simply because it bravely examines an alternative lifestyle as does every other movie coming out of Hollywood these days. So brave. Can we all sing the ""Brokeback Mountain"" polka?This is as ground-breaking to gay film-making as ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is as groundbreaking to liberal history books about McCarthy. Which is to say it bows to political correctness. With some tunes. I give it a 2 out of 10, one point because it is vaguely based on that classic opera and one point for only one good song.",Rent
102,jmazznyc,All About the Score,9,27 July 2019,"525,600 Minutes. Period.
The Bway musical was astounding in its day, and this movie version captures every original heartbreaking, groundbreaking, moment.
You just can not spoil a brilliant score and book if an excellent cast is employed; it was. The sets were appropriately circus-like, in keeping with the original stage version.Admittedly, I do have a bias. One of my best friends died of AIDS in 1999. Mercifully the end came rather quickly for him. So he was healthy enough for us to see Rent on stage in 1997.
He never stopped crying. It is an experience that will be part of my heart and soul forever.
""Seasons of Love"" was sung at his memorial.The naysayers here accuse the positive reviewers of simplistic accusations of homophobia and just ""not getting it"".
I have to agree.
In this era of Trump, narrow mindedness reigns.",Rent
103,Lockout_Salties,Actual reality! Act up! Fight Rent!,2,21 May 2020,"I have never seen any stage production of Rent. And, based on this cinematic atrocity, I really don't want to. Rent the movie is dull, offensive, grotesque, pretentious, and so, so mind-numbingly boring. You have no idea how miserable my viewing experience with this garbage was. It is, easily, the second worst movie musical I have ever seen, behind only the Nutcracker in 3D. At least Rent doesn't have spontaneuous moments of genuine terror sprinkled into what is supposed to be a fun Christmas movie.Let's start small with the musical numbers. They aren't terrible, but they also aren't good. Take for instance the opening number in the movie, ""Seasons of Love"". On one level, it makes sense to start the movie since this is the most famous number in the whole show. But really, if you think about it for more than a second, it doesn't make a lick of sense for this to be your first song. Why on earth are you singing about how a year has passed when it's just starting? It's a little aggravating in its blatant need to pander to theatre fans by screaming ""Look! We're singing that one song!!!!!"" Honestly. But unfortunately, all of the songs in the films are way too catchy for their own good, without the lyrical prowess to back themselves up. Most of the songs are either pointless, angering, or the mad ravings of lunatics that make actually no sense, but I guess it works because Bohemia or something. My prime example of the latter is one of the later songs in the movie, ""La Vie Boheme"", although to be honest they could've very easily renamed it ""This song is random, which makes it edgy and good and Bohemian"". The lyrics sound like someone's shopping list crossed with an encyclopedia. But the worst part of it all is how catchy it is. So, instead of the song being mercifully forgotten by you soon after watching it, you are left with it playing constantly in your head, like a broken record composed by the inmates of a mental institution. It is agonzing to sit through, and is still stuck in my head to this day. But hey, at least the anger and confusion I felt during these songs served as some sort of emotion to feel in this otherwise lifeless and soul-sucking movie.The real problem with Rent is its characters. Oh, goodness gracious, the characters. It's certainly not the actors' faults. It is quite the feat that they delivered the ""serious"" lines without even a smirk. Really, the script turns a bunch of twentysomethings in New York into the most infuriating people imaginable. None of them actually care about AIDS or homeless people. The only ones who having anything to do with AIDS are actively exploiting the suffering of its victims. Special shout-out to Mark, whose entire motivation for doing so is to create a film that is an uninspired and pointless collage of human struggle, with no attempt at social commentary, or really anything good (gee, sound familiar?) And even at the very end of the movie, when Mimi has literally just returned to consciousness after overdosing on drugs, Mark just can't help but play his movie because he's sick of seconds being spent on Mimi when they could be spent admiring his genius. Go step on legos, Mark.But pretty much everyone else in the movie has nothing to do with AIDS at all. Even when a homeless woman calls out Mark on his explotative tactics that make the mondo movies of the 60s and 70s blush, everyone just pretends like nothing happens and goes on supporting Mark. What was the point of this if it didn't make anyone change? Was it just as a moment of catharsis so that the audience didn't quit watching halfway through the movie? Because that would not surprise me. The mvoei asks such deep and thought provoking questions like ""Who cares about the AIDS epidemic when we have hot young Roger and Mimi flirting?"" and ""Isn't Angel the dog murderer so delightfully quirky?"" Frankly, it is a little appalling just how little the movie actually cares about the suffering it portrays. Rent just wants to look like it cares, not actually challenge anything or portray anything with earnestness. The focus groups wouldn't approve, and they certainly would get a less-than-desirable R rating. If you want to watch a good movie musical about AIDS, too bad, there isn't one. My suggestion is to read the Wikipedia article about AIDS. It provides a much more engaging, honest, and emotionally investing portrayal of AIDS than anything in Rent.FInal Score: 16/100.",Rent
104,AnimagusGirl,Worth your Saturday.,10,31 December 2005,"If you've seen RENT on Broadway, this movie is for you. If you haven't, you may like this too. Most is kept the same, with 3/4 of the original Broadway cast, excluding Rosario Dawson as Mimi, and Tracie Thoms as Joanne.It keeps most of the songs intact, some left out are: We're Okay, The Tune-Ups, Voicemails, and On The Street, and sometimes they are still in the movie, just spoken.This movie is heartwarming and emotional, its characters have plenty of depth, and perhaps the best part of all is that it covers and talks about openly the things that are bothering America today (and this was written in '96): Homophobia, AIDS/HIV, the homeless, being poor, etc. All of which is portrayed in catchy, sometimes, beautiful songs, and with a nice ensemble ranging from bouncy drag queens to pessimistic AIDS-infected musicians to out-of-touch filmmakers.All in all, 10/10.",Rent
105,Awakening124,Hit miss hit miss his miss WHAM,9,3 December 2005,"I'll admit, when Mark starts singing Rent while riding his bike I thought, ""Ouch, there's a miss. This feels awkward and cheesy."" But then the rest of the song plays outand I'm getting chills five times a second. During Out Tonight I was having a blast, but then it goes straight into Another Day with ""Who do you think you are?"" and that line sung in film was also awkward, as was Roger's later sung line, ""I'm trying', I'm not lyin'"" Yes, people, there are a few awkward ""misses."" When I was watching it in theaters for the first time, being a complete Rent newbie, when act one closed with La Vie Boheme, Iactually thought it was over'cause clips from Mark's film started playing and Seasons of Love started up. I thought, ""If they start rolling the credits and that was it, this will officially be a disappointment despite some great numbers."" Thank God it wasn't the end.With misses amongst the hits, I was surprised when I started bawling at Without You and only stopped for What You Own, but then the tears again when the finale came around. It's insane peaks completely make up for it's occasional shallow valleys, making it (all in all) a very moving, inspiring film.After watching the deleted scenes, the only one I really wished they had kept in was Goodbye Love because it was such a vital scene that put a few pieces together...that and it had the prettiest piano in the whole show with some more wonderful acting from Rosario Dawson. They could have easily left off Santa Fe and cut down Over the Moon to fit it in (they were both the weakest numbers by far, SF feeling awkward and OTM not only feeling REALLY awkward, but lasting way too long). Oh well, at least it's on the special features.I liked it more the second time I watched, and even more the third. While the direction is a bit lacking in some places(some great singing moments were hampered by not showing the actors face, therefore minorly robbing the moment of emotion) everything else is just so darn amazing.After loving Moulin Rouge, Phantom of the Opera, and Chicago for so long, Rent was a nice breath of fresh air even though it wasn't perfect. If you need inspiration and love musicals, look no further than Rent.",Rent
106,Isau,Disappointing,5,26 December 2005,"I'll begin by admitting I have never seen Rent on stage. This review will concentrate on Rent as a movie rather than as an extension of a stage show.Rent, the movie, was a mixed bag for me. On the good side, all of the actors perform well. Rosario Dawson and the guy who played Tom Collins stood out in particular. Additionally all of the singing voices were excellent, outdoing similar Hollywood efforts like Chicago and Moulin Rouge (although not exceeding legendary vocals like Cheryl Barnes' turn in Hair). The actress playing Joanne and the actor playing Collins deserve special credit for their voices, and the actor playing Angel is a fantastic dancer, far better than what is typically seen from leads in this sort of movie.Unfortunately, despite its good production values, there were several places where Rent failed to connect. For starters, the set design was good but a bit too glossy. Another reviewer said it looked like ""Disneyland"" and I'm inclined to agree; la vie bohemme in fiberglass. The sets were also dimly lit in many cases, making it difficult to see the actor's faces.The most unforgivable aspect of Rent, sadly, is the pandering storyline. Despite the best efforts of the actors, the drama simply fails to connect. Never in this film did I feel close to the characters or sympathy for their plight. Instead they came across as whiny, self destructive, and demanding. I do not know how much of this originated from the play. The message of the movie very nearly seems to be ""Honest work destroys the soul."" Another criticism I have, and as far as I can tell this goes all the way back to the source material, is that the situation of these characters seems rather unbelievable and, more specifically, the musical style mostly irrelevant to them. If I had to guess what kind of music squatters in New York City would choose to represent themselves, the lyrical stylings of Rent would be far, far down the list. In this way Rent seems more to reflect external perceptions of the ""bohemian life"" than how real people in these situations would chose to present themselves. This may be what the author intended, but I doubt if most viewers interpret it that way.On a final note, I have already seen some people accuse some Rent detractors of not ""getting"" it because of inherent homophobia, fear of AIDS and so on. As a gay man, the ex-lover of someone who is currently suffering from HIV, and someone with more than a little experience with some of the vices shown in this film, I absolve anyone feeling guilty, because Rent, the movie, does not really make a convincing argument about any of these situations. I am glad on some level that the film was ""brave"" enough to try, but a better follow-through would have increased my enjoyment.My overall score: 5/10",Rent
107,Matt-60,Ignore all the other comments,1,18 November 2005,"Wow, so many glowing reviews. They must have rented Chicago or something, because nothing in their reviews could be used to describe this steaming pile of donkey excrement. I am shocked an appalled that people like this tripe, it was awful. Everything about it was awful, the only thing I can think of that was good was Rosario Dawson's stripper scene..because she's hot. I know thats crude, but I'm trying to reach for the good here. Oh! they also had free cookies and brownies at the screening, so that was good too. But I cannot even begin to describe how everything in this movie, from the music, the songs, the acting(and I LIKE Rosario Dawson and Jesse L Martin!) were terrible. It was boring. So. Very. Boring. Melodramatic, self important, overblown, bad singing, bad choreography, no reason to give a flying crap about the people in it. Do not see this movie. Go rent Chicago, or All That Jazz. In fact, I am going to go out and buy those movies tomorrow so I can wash this horrible experience out of my system. This movie made me realize just how much Chicago earned my money.

But I figured I'd give it a chance. Besides, I might actually like it.I didn't. I turned it off after half an hour. The songs were just terrible. I hate to sound like an insensitive republican, but it seems to me that a lot of the character's problems could have been solved by getting day jobs. That way they could do things like pay for utilities, eat and have health insurance. I can appreciate wanting to be an artist, but it's nice to have a day job too.

If you had told me that eventually it would become one of my favorite movies, I'd laugh in your face.I knew that Rent was a Broadway show and loosely based on La Boheme, but truthfully I had no idea what Rent was about the first time I watched it on TV. In fact, I found it ridiculous that people would suddenly engage themselves in a well-choreographed impromptu dance number, where even total strangers knew the routine. I didn't even watch the film the whole way through.The second time, however, I started really getting into the characters. And through lots and lots of suspension of disbelief, I sat through the whole film. But I realized the more I watched it the more I started understanding the deeper meaning of the lyrics and the relationships between the main characters. The character I think stood out the most (for probably obvious reasons) was Angel. Even though the character had AIDS, she manages to be the most positive and optimistic person in the movie. She had a beautiful outlook on life that many people typically don't share. Life is for the living, and she was the soul of the group.The movie's about so many things: the importance of having positive, meaningful relationships (something Aristotle could appreciate), the AIDS epidemic in America, drug abuse, the death of the Bohemian lifestyle in New York City, the way one's own integrity is worth more than all the money in the world, to forgiving and loving ourselves, and to not wait until someone's on their deathbed to tell them how you feel.

Her AIDS turns out to be not so fatal, even after she is found with a high fever after almost a month living in the streets. After her death scene she suddenly awakes, tells of her near-death experience, her fever breaks, and she says she feels great.

They, like me, sat through the 135-minute saga of self-destructive youth dry-eyed.

This film was so well done, and this is coming from someone who usually stays away from musicals. The film is a rock/pop musical. the songs are catchy and the soundtrack is among the best I've heard. The movie covers many subject areas such as the urban decay in America's major cities, socially dislodged youth, aids, homosexuality and the erosion of typical American ideals. The film goes from comedic to tragic and does not try too hard to be a classic. Usually it takes a certain person to embrace a musical, however ""Rent"" appeals to pop culture in the present day and the era of the late 1980's whereby the film was set.

114,Jvbway,"A worthy attempt, but on the whole disappointing",7,13 December 2005,"Audiences have been waiting for a film version of ""Rent"" since the show opened on Broadway in 1995, so when the film would finally arrive, it would have high expectations to meet. And while there are moments of this film that are extremely satisfying, it doesn't achieve the potential level of excellence it could have. What director Chris Columbus succeeded in doing was making sure that this was a period piece, not a modern statement, since, in truth, the show now seems dated on Broadway because of just that. It is also beneficial to see the performances of most of the original cast, with a wonderful addition of Tracie Thoms. However, the film greatly suffers by changing the piece from being a rock opera, to a conventional musical, eliminating nearly all of the recitative and adding a significant amount of dialog, which ranges from bland to laughable. And while the film is set in alphabet city 1989, one can't help but feel that they seem to be living in the present day, especially by adding the unnecessary commitment ceremony of Maureen and Joanne. Other elements of the story seem sugar coated, such as not mentioning the fact that Rodger's girlfriend slit her wrists, in the film we are left to believe she simply died of HIV. And with the addition of Tracie Thom, we get Rosario Dawson's Mimi. Dawson is an adept actress, but she does not succeed in finding the emotional vulnerability that is vital in order to make Mimi work. Since Thom was not in the original cast, but played Joanne in a replacement cast on Broadway, This writer believes that Marcy Harriell should have been chosen to play Mimi, as she was the only Mimi i saw on stage who truly broke my heart.",Rent

I was very pleased with hearing these news. But as time went by, I started thinking about all the ways this movie wouldn't work. One- Chris Columbus is the director (even though he did great with Harry Potter, I would have chosen many others before him). 2- Although the original cast is the only perfect cast for the show, they are a little too old for their roles and 3- It was shot in San Francisco instead of the location of the show, New York City. Even though there were these things I was worried about, I went to the movie with the highest hopes for the film. PLOT: 8 bohemians (some with AIDS) in NYC struggle with life, love and starving to make art and beauty in the world they live in. Here are my thoughts of the final version of the film:DISLIKES: 1- It should have been shot in NYC. It didn't look very believable at times, especially when the snow fell. 2- :::::::SPOILERS HEREIN:::::: They SHOULD have kept ""Goodbye Love."" The film, the story is not the same without it. It doesn't make sense! After Angel dies, they all fight and then it goes right into ""What You Own"". The fight between Roger and Mark was extremely necessary to show you that these men are hurting, fighting and depressed. That song also shows you that Mimi is dying. You don't know whats going on without that part of the song :::::::END SPOILER:: 3- They should have had more of Angel and Benny. You don't sympathize with Angel that much, and you don't hate Benny as much as you do in the show because they don't have enough screen-time. Basically, after ""Take Me Or Leave Me"", the film failed...except for the ending.LIKES:1- The Cast. Everyone was amazing, and they were very believable in their roles as young starving artists. Yes, Jesse didn't look as young as the others did, but that doesn't take away from anything. 2- The Whole first half was wonderful. Best numbers were ""La Vie Boheme"", ""Out Tonight"" ""Take Me Or Leave Me"" ""Rent"" and ""Tango: Maureen"". 2- The ending. Thats all i'm going to say.

119,bfreilly,A cloying piece of cinema claptrap.,2,23 February 2006,"""Rent"" is the portrait of eight down-on-their-luck bohemians as they struggle through one year in New York City. The audience is supposed to feel their pain as they suffer with AIDS, drugs, love, and death. We are expected to laugh, weep, and maybe even sing along as we watch them live their lives. But, God help me, I can't do that.Emotion is used as a club and pathos is spread around with a shovel. This movie is essentially daring the audience not to feel something for our heroes and heroines. ""You WILL like these people! You WILL have sympathy for them! If you do not, you are obviously a insensitive jerk with the taste of a five-year old!"" I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't watch a movie to have a moral shoved down my throat. Besides, I couldn't connect to the characters even if I wanted to. After watching this movie, I came away with the impression that bohemians were all either sleazy or whiny. Hmm, I wonder why you can't pay your rent. Could it be because you are a wanna-be documentarian and your roommate is a washed-up songwriter? Well, boo-hoo. I have no sympathy available for a drug-addicted stripper and an annoying performance artist. I was especially irritated when Mark (the documentarian) says that he ""sold his soul"" after getting a job with a local television station. For the love of God, get down off your pedestal. You can either be ""an artist"" or you can pay your rent and buy food.I'm divided on the cast: some people, such as Anthony Rapp (Mark) and Tracie Thoms (Joanne), I felt did a decent job of portraying their characters. On the other hand, Idina Menzel's performance (as Maureen) was so over-the-top and so irritating that I prayed everyone else would gang up and toss her out of the loft window. Most of the songs were downright dumb, except for the first song and the ""Tango Maureen"", which I though were OK.""Rent"" tries far too hard to make an impact on it's audience. Almost everything is over done to the point of ridiculousness. The only emotions I felt during this whole mess were irritation and disgust. The length of this piece of cinema schlock didn't help my mood either; it was so long, I thought it was being shown in real time and that it actually would cover a whole year. The only reason that this movie didn't rate a one out of ten in my book is the few decent songs and actors/actresses.

120,wdbrown,The movie equivalent of Al Capone's Vault,2,8 January 2006,"I just finished watching Rent (the movie), and, despite what one hears from the ravings of the ""Disciples of 'Rent'"" this movie is the biggest entertainment disappointment I have experienced in the last ten years. I won't say it is the worst movie I have seen because I have seen some pretty bad ones and enjoyed them, but ""Rent"" is the first movie that bored me to the point of praying for the end to come swiftly.It is not without any redeeming value. There are some individual numbers that are quite interesting, but overall, I just didn't think everything fit very well. The only thing distinctive about many of the longer group numbers was the individual voices of the performers (all very good by the way). Furthermore, it was derivative. The movie was like one great homage to the ""touch-feely-preachy"" musicals of the 70s and and early 80s. The song during Angel's funeral was the most repetitive thing I have heard since Godspell's ""Day by Day."" This movie contained everything that insured the end of the movie musical in the 60s. Singing and dancing down the street, on the subway, in a pub, cross country nearly anything that smacked of no realism. Some critics have mentioned that ""Rent"" seems dated. It does so in the same way that ""West Side Story"" doesn't translate well to today's audiences.And could there have been any more clichéd scenes? Roger leaves for Santa Fe (singing all the way). Mark is in New York. As both sing about completing their goal (to write a song and edit a documentary respectively) we find Roger singing as he walks down the road, Mark as he walks angrily down the middle of a New York street, then after Mark, still singing goes to the roof of his building to continue singing his song, Roger has finally made it back to New York, by bus and singing, to complete the song with his friend on the roof. Please give me a break! Another example. Rosario Dawson collapses and the camera pans down the length of her arm. I turned to my wife and said, ""her fingers will twitch"" and then they did.I can't fault the performances. They were energetic and characters were clearly delineated. They all sing well, but the songs all blend together and, ultimately, don't sound different. Everything is loud. There is no variety. The few attempts at ballads devolve into over-the-top, over-repetitive attempts at semi-harmonizing. Additionally, what dialog there is seems to be only a set-up for the next song which doesn't drive the plot so much as it illustrates that single scene.As for characters - they seemed one-dimensional. There is a brooding musician, flirtatious bisexual, jealous lesbian, desperate-for-love junkie. It's a good thing Rent isn't touted as a romance. The only members of the cast to find true love are either stricken with AIDS, heroin addicts, homosexual, or a combination of the three. The understanding, good-guy heterosexual has no one. There's a message for you! So whose fault is it? The buck stops at the director. I have not been unhappy with Chris Columbus in the past. I don't expect high art, but I get some fairly decent entertainment with a little imagination. If anything was lacking in this movie it was imagination from behind the lens. Instead of something new and different I got something old and hackneyed.I was hoping for so much more from ""Rent."" Ultimately, I paid more for my ticket of admission than the characters were willing to pay for their living quarters. They were content to freeload because they were artists. But their art, in the final analysis, was not worth the money or the time I spent. It was the movie equivalent of Al Capone's vault. All hype and a lot of dust.I give it a 2 only because the performers were interesting and worked so hard.",Rent
121,gabi-12,"""How do you connect in an age where strangers, landlords, lovers, your own blood cells betray...""",5,27 November 2005,"I kind of loved this movie, but I also kinda hated it. For all the reasons that Chris Columbus should be shot, if he was, then this movie wouldn't exist in the first place, and that's probably a bad thing, if only because now us Rent-heads can buy the undoubtedly overpriced DVD and see it come to life anytime we want instead of just listening to it. The fact that the voices on it are almost exactly the same as the ones on our soundtracks just makes it all the better to watch on repeat.The casting of the original Broadway cast was brilliant, even if they showed signs of age. These are the people who made Rent happen in the first place, the first actors to lend voice to Larson's songs, and the only cast who got to work with Larson himself. Even if Columbus didn't himself understand what point he was trying to make, these actors sure did, and if it weren't for them, the film would have made even less sense.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what the message of Rent is, especially in 2005. That's part of the problem with the film - it's set in 1989 (which we only learn through a voice over), but it looks very much like 2005. No one bothered to date it beyond the one line telling us what year it is.The problem with a 2005 movie version of this story is that it was written during a very specific time, about a very specific time in the composer's life. Much of it is based on him and his friends hanging out in NY while he was trying to write musicals. Somehow, all of that comes through in the play, even recently, but not so much in the film. So a musical set during the height of the AIDS crisis works brilliantly when you know that it was written against a backdrop of grunge rock and Gen X slackerdom. But give it a glossy Hollywood make over, and suddenly it feels a little lost. I feel like if you didn't know all that about the original material, and have never seen this story before, you might wonder why you're supposed to care about these self righteous artist-types who happen to have AIDS.There was a lot about this movie that didn't make sense, but I blame that on Columbus's lack of directing skills and tendency to make things more simplistic than they should be. Why take out the line informing us that Roger's ex girlfriend killed herself? Perhaps Roger's constant moping would have made a teeny bit more sense of they had included that in the ""One Song Glory"" flashback. Why reduce Mimi's relationship with Benny to one line towards the end, so that when it does surface, it seems as if it came from nowhere? Nevermind Columbus's obvious lack of competence and reverence for musicals. It felt as if right before pre production started, he said to himself, ""ok, gotta do some research."" So he watched ""West Side Story"" and ""Moulin Rouge."" Which is why I hated ""The Tango Maureen."" Because it looked exactly like the Tango scene in ""Moulin Rouge."" And why I hated ""Rent,"" because it looked like the opening scene in ""West Side Story,"" as did pretty much any scene in this movie which had the characters walking/dancing down the street. You could tell Columbus had trouble committing to the fact that Rent is, in fact, a musical, and because of this, the random breaking into song looked a little jarring at times. Especially since the lines that are usually sung were changed to dialogue, making it look even weirder when all of a sudden it turns into a song. Also, the dialogue rhymed. That was weird.After all that, it probably looks like I REALLY hated this movie. Except here's the part where I loved it: It was Rent. On the big screen. With the original cast. Singing. Just like they do on the soundtrack. Fortunately, even though he missed the point in some respects, Columbus didn't mess with it enough to ruin its original images and message. I loved seeing ""La Vie Boheme,"" the same way it looks on stage, on screen. I loved seeing Angel in her Santa suit. I loved seeing that reconnection between Mark and Roger during ""What You Own,"" my very favorite song in the whole musical. I loved seeing Idina Menzel belt out ""Over the Moon"" as if she actually believes it. I was moved by seeing the members of the Life Support meeting disappear (in fact, this was the only part of the film that I found especially moving). I was emotional during Angel's funeral, and Jesse L. Martin kicked ass on his version of ""I'll Cover You."" The performances really saved this movie, I think, and for me, Anthony Rapp kind of stole the show.As for the cheesy ending where Mimi comes back to life, Jonathan Larson was quoted once as saying this: ""It's not how many years you live, but how you fulfill the time you spend here...that's sort of the point of the show."" For all of its misgivings, I think that point does manage to come across relatively well in the film. Whether or not we've remembered the point by the time we get to the end is a whole other story.",Rent

Like many others, I was a bit scared the movie would change the magic of the play, but that was not the case. While I do think that you really should have seen the play first to really appreciate the movie, watching the movie cleared up a lot of confusion one may have during the play. It was just great! It was like seeing an extended version of the play and having a much better seat! The music was absolutely wonderful, and the cast couldn't have been better!

124,Reggie_Charan,Just wasn't that good,5,9 April 2006,"I've never seen Rent on Broadway. In fact, I've never seen any musicals at all. I really liked the Hedwig & the Angry Inch soundtrack, though. Hearing that Rent was also a rock music based production, I thought I'd give it a try. Best I can say about it is that it reminds me of an episode of the 80's TV show Fame. Not much of an endorsement, I guess, but I thought Rent just wasn't that good.There were a few songs that were memorable (Seasons of Love, Out Tonight, La Vie Boheme) but some real stinkers (You'll See, Tango Maureen) that had me reaching for the fast forward button more than once. I could relate to the story line of trying to make your way through life's ups and downs with the love and support of good friends around you, but except for Angel, none of these characters seemed particularly appealing. Have enough money for smack, yet you don't want to pay your rent? Sorry, that's not how the real world works, people. The cast seems to have all the charm of smug high school wanna-be thespians.",Rent

Namely 'Over the Moon' I think this song just slows the whole show/film down.My favourite song 'Tango Maureen' I thought was excellent. Just sooo good, if you loved the stage show I think you will love the film. Unfortunately it got very limited release in Australia, so if you're Australian go see it NOW, cause it's gonna be gone soon.Rosario Dawson was fantastic, as were the original cast members. I also loved Joanne. Just a great musical film.Although the bon jovi film clip style filming for 'Living in America' i thought was appalling. We were laughin all the way through it. Seriously who the hell let that go through unedited.",Rent
126,Kieth11,"Excellent, until the end",9,28 December 2014,"Sorry for spoiling the ending, but it's really the only complaint I have about the movie.Before I start, this is, without a doubt, one of the best musicals I've ever seen, with great actors and beautiful, awesome music, but the ending, while not horrible, wasn't the best, for these reasons.It seemed a little drawn out. There were several instances where I thought the movie would end; the screen would blacken, and then boom! Another song? Not that that's a bad thing, just appeared to be drawn out a bit.The other thing, is there was a death. When Angel died, sure it seemed sad, but I never really got to know him. Okay, he's transgender, and has a relationship with one of the main characters. That's about all we know about him. It might have been implied he's a bit of a dancer for money (near the beginning of the movie), but we don't know anything about him, really, or for that fact, anything about many of the characters, therefore when Angel died, sure it was sad, but I just didn't really feel too much, just a bit sad.Since I'm on the topic of death, here's the main reason why it went from 10/10 to 9/10. Angel died, and then Mimi goes missing. Of course they find her, and then the movie does the ""She appears dead, but actually isn't for some reason"" cliché. When she appeared dead, sure I wondered if she was actually going to die, but I was rolling my eyes because just like, minutes before that Angel died. I wasn't sad when Mimi appears to be dead, I was actually like, ""Come on. I'll be pretty mad if two characters die in a row.""Just a little thing, but the ending was also so confusing. So much happened. We never really got to mourn too much over Angel, and how did he die, exactly? So much happened I don't even know how he died, so while his funeral was going on, that question was going on through my mind.Anyway, enough with my complaints. All these things were at the end of the movie, but the rest of the movie, the movie as a whole, was excellent. I absolutely love it, and highly recommend it!",Rent

And the fact that they are good singers is a plus. This movie is based upon real life. You really do have people in the world that live as the people did in Rent. This movie was very interesting and it also teaches you a lot about life and what it has to offer. I promise that if you watch this movie, by the time its over, you will have tears rolling down your face. Its touching and it sends out a good message.

128,eemodork,a very valiant effort,8,14 December 2005,"first of all, the fact that they actually translated the show into a film is a feat in its self. the show, i used to think, could only be viewed on stage, but not anymore. The movie makes it easier for the viewer to make personal connections with the characters.The music, for the most part was great, (minus today for you, all the songs sounded amazing, i just liked the techno-ish version of the song from the Broadway show better). Rosario Dawson sings better than i expected, and man can Idina Mendel and Traci Thomas belt it out! Some of the cuts they made we uncalled for (hello they cut the whole Christmas song scene! i love that scene!) and they changed how April dies (the suicide was important part of the show that got cut out).But the movie works so well. They didn't make it too flashy, (minus tango Maureen which was wonderful!! I liked how they showed it through Mark hitting his head.) I was so surprised how well the music numbers worked well in reality. It seemed kind of natural to have them break out in song.I feel like the more I watch this movie, the more I will like it. And i like it a lot!",Rent
129,is_everybody_going_crazy32,Brilliantly brought from Broadway,9,12 April 2006,"Rent originated in the 1990's, written by Jonathan Larson, who sadly never saw it come to life on Broadway. The movie, directed by Chris Columbus,(Mrs. Doubtfire; Harry Potter films 1 and 2) this movie was carefully and brilliantly brought to the big screen from Broadway. The story is almost the exact same starring all but three of the original stars. The story documents the life of eight friends who grow apart and together after an incredible year of hard ache and drama, including death, disease and the ever so popular, love. But these friends learn the value of sticking together no matter what.The songs are very agreeable, and in a way easy to relate to. It's one of the first musicals that would actually attract young people, such as myself, to watch because it's not opera or classical like West Side Story or The Phantom of the Opera. This musical includes rock songs, pop songs and even some R&B. The cast was brilliant, not changing much about their characters and, to my surprise these people can actually sing! No voice overs whats so ever. Well, no surprise considering they were good enough to be on Broadway. Most of the cast, including Anothony Rapp, Adam Pascal and Idina Menzel had won awards for their original edition of Rent.This movie is inspiring, with great music, entertaining stories of love and even great scenery of what New york would looked like in the years of 1989 and 1990. I highly suggest it to those who enjoy musicals, for it's one of the best I've seen come to the big screen...Also stars Rosario Dawson (Sin City), Jesse L. Martin, Tracie Thomas, Taye Diggs and Wilson Jermaine Heredia.",Rent

If I haven't said it already, THANK YOU! While I thought that the omission of most of Goodbye Love was a bit jarring, since to me it's necessary to set up What You Own, and I missed some of the other songs being, well, SUNG, rather than spoken as dialogue, other than that I can't find another thing to complain about...Any RENTHead who doesn't like it is nitpicking...because I am one, and I LOVED IT!It's Oscar time....and it BETTER get nominated, because if it doesn't, it will show the Academy for the phonies they are!THANK YOU Chris Columbus and the stars of the movie for making me believe again that a movie CAN be made of a hit Broadway musical without ruining it!

131,Imaginist,Rent (2/5),3,24 February 2006,"Synopsis: ""Rent"" in a word is pretentious. In fact, it is grade-A sh*t. ""Rent"" is a musical about AIDS. So while some dumb b*tch is singing about her impending death we cannot help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. Who the hell sings about stuff like this? If I ever saw a group of people dancing and singing about 25600 minutes or whatever the hell it is, I would turn right around and run for my life. That is the problem with making a musical that tries to take itself seriously: musicals are in themselves not SERIOUS. How can a film consistently bend reality with musical numbers and then expect the audience to take the situation as realistic and important?There are songs about death, candles, and of course ""the bohemian life! Oh yay!"" Talk about melodramatic. And since when does being an artist mean that one has to contract AIDS? Everyone in this damn play is a starving artist with AIDS. They keep complaining about having no money, so how about they get off their asses and work another job while singing their shitty songs? They seem to think that artists are not only above society, but above paying rent. Damn that bad landlord! How dare he kick them out of their hellhole after a year with NO RENT?! Do you see why I called this pretentious?Another reason why this film is so terrible is its pure soap-opera-like plot lines. Everyone either dies, hooks up, or a combination of both. We are supposed to be sad when the characters die, but how can we be! Five seconds after dying they come back to do a reprise! The music blows, the story blows, and worst yet this is a very serious issue. AIDS is something that should be looked at with a serious eye, but this film makes a mockery of the whole subject. For that reason alone people should burn every copy of this waste of space. But if you really must watch this pile of dung then I recommend you rent ""Team America: World Police."" They have a great segment that satires the musical, and when a satire consisting of puppets is more believable than this sorry excuse for film, it means something is definitely out of order. However, not all was lost as I really enjoyed Rosario Dawson, and the main song was rather good. I will award ""Rent"" a generous: 2 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist",Rent

Which makes it even more tragic when Angel dies of AIDS. Honest to God, at least 20 people in the theater were crying during ""I'll Cover You Reprise""My expectations truly exceeded me this time.

I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!! It's great to see with a group of friends or so. The meaning is so powerful to gays, lesbians, or people with AIDS. I love the songs so much and the story was beautiful. During the first few minutes of the movie I don't think I got Angel that much until I saw the whole thing through. He had so much love for people he didn't even know and was friendly to everybody, whether he knew them or not. The love between Mimi and Roger was so deep. I thought it was so romantic when they were singing to each other in the snow. I loved that part. I also love the part when they're singing and dancing in the restaurant and Joanne and Maurine are kissing and the guys at Benny's table look at them weird and they looked at them and said "" Mister she's my sister"" I thought that was so funny and cheesy at the same time.

135,Havoc1,"La Vie... um... Well, it Certainly was NOT ""Boheme.""",4,26 November 2005,"QUICK SUMMARY - RENT 4/10 (below average) ~ A musical that just isn't fun. It doesn't celebrate the bohemian world, nor does it give any reason to. To the contrary, it doesn't sink in to be an adequate ""portrait"" of the lifestyle it tries to represent. Thus, like Harry Potter 4, it's so embedded with the source material that it doesn't dive in and do a complete transcription from one medium to the other, nor does it step back and become its own. It's scattered and unfocused. For performance, Rosario, Jesse L. Martin, and Tracie Thoms own their roles, while Heredia is forgettable, and the last three are just awful. Music for the ""rock"" songs dwarfs the vocals. Columbus does not do the film justice. ~----Let me preface for the rabid fan crowd that I am a long-time Rent fan. If you look over my dusty yearbooks, you'll see several Rent quotations. In fact, my very best friend and I got ""Seasons of Love"" voted our class song -- in a very non-white, urban school which was not an easy feat. RENT was something to treasure.And we despised the movie. I went with my very best friend (VBF), another Rent fan of ours and my 14-year old sister. Across the board? Everyone found it awful. And for many different reasons. Make no mistake, this RENT is slick and commercial, empty and without soul. More importantly, it is. not. fun.I disliked it because the characters were unsympathetic. I live in Lincoln Park, Chicago, so gentrification is a buzzword we hear a lot. Like many reviewers, RENT makes it hard to find sympathy for characters that will not get ""real"" jobs, go out of their way to be obnoxious (I'm looking at you, Maureen), and who whine to no end. The only characters that come off as likable and sympathetic are the two grounded, financially stable characters: the underused Joanne and Benny. Mimi and Collins add a pizazz of life to an otherwise bleak sextet of ""bohemians."" But on the whole, Columbus and the script fail to add what makes the Bohemian lifestyle good. How does it celebrate life? The characters spout off catch phrases about ""measuring your life in love"" and ""no day but today"" but to what end? They all seem just as selfish and whiny in the end as they were in the beginning.VBF disliked it because of poor characterization and lack of character cohesion. Columbus frames ""Out Tonight"" as Mimi being empowered by her stripping, using it to give her enough chutzpah to ask out Roger. Later in the film, Mimi completely falls apart when Roger ""leaves"" her. For a character that's supposed to be empowered by this self-sufficiency, why does she suddenly fall to pieces when the prominent man leaves her life? To her, it was out of character. And she ABHORED the tacked on Maureen/Joanne ""commitment ceremony"" bit. Not only is it incredibly out of place, she argued, but also out of character for Joanne's conservative roots. Collins and Angel seemed so ""buddy"" and not like the lovers they were portrayed to be - constantly high-fiving and nudging each other. And Roger is screaming his love song to Mimi in the end, rather than playing it on his guitar - a nuance she found wholly irritating.Our other friend hated the direction and (some) cast. Too many flashbacks and montages. One Song Glory was butchered with horrible flashbacks of Roger and his ex-girlfriend, April. Cheesy shots of the characters dancing in the streets. Awkward close-up shots of Roger screaming ""Your Eyes"" at Mimi. The HORRIBLE rendition of ""What You Own."" And she hated Idina Menzel and Anthony Rapp. Idina is obnoxious, and gives no reason to gain all of the attention she receives. A character loved in the stage version becomes EASILY the most dislikeable in the film. Adam Pascal only got off slightly better, looking way too old for his part. Other friend disliked Collins as well, though VBF and I thought he was the best of the returning OBC. Different strokes.My little sis disliked it because it was long and not fun. Here is the clincher. RENT is about CELEBRATING LIFE, but there is very little to celebrate here. Mostly because Columbus, et al, spend a huge chunk of the movie trying to develop the characters. I have to chalk it to him for this: they really tried to give Mark, Roger, Mimi, Collins, and Angel some (much needed) padding to their characters (Benny, Joanne, and Maureen got the shaft in the film). But it obscured the message.Aside from ""La Vie Boheme,"" RENT just isn't fun. Riots and whining, and drama, and anger without any celebration. We were supposed to see the budding romances, establish the drama, and then break it all down in the second act. Everyone was supposed to be devastated, and then we are supposed to understand the things that matter: life, love, and family. Not finances or securities. The message is gone from RENT, it's too dark to be fun, and not soulful enough to justify its darkness.The music is all right, but there are too many songs crammed into the first act, leaving little time to explain the characters. Many of the songs were awkward when they started, only to let the viewer get into the groove so to speak halfway through. Then the song ends.The rest of the audience? One fan gave an enthusiastic clap when the credits rolled, only to stop once she found out no-one joined her. Then a bunch of stifled laughters happened from the audience.RENT was and is bad. I just hope people will listen to the OBC so I don't have to defend it at my high school reunion because of the film. Blugh.",Rent

To be deified (""Angel""? Wow. Be a bit more transparent, why don't you?) you must be an unemployed, gay, black, transvestite, drug addict with AIDS. What? You couldn't come up with a more PC character?3. You can demand and receive free rent for a year (then attack the person who gave it to you) and one day when you actually get a check for doing virtually nothing, you can be offended and say ""I don't want your charity"".4. People who own property have no right to charge anyone to live there and are not entitled to do with it what they want.5. None of your self-inflicted problems are your fault, but the fault of the evil rich white heterosexual men.6. Being employed in any field other than entertainment is ""selling out"". Also, if your entertainment garners enough interest that you can actually make a living doing it, you're still ""selling out"".That being said, this movie had no redeemable qualities. It was way too long, too full of propaganda and ultra-leftist clichés, ill cast (way too old), and extremely contrived. ...and the songs were lousy.Please do not allow your impressionable children to be brainwashed by this tripe. That the nauseating claptrap of this trash is just assumed to be understood and mainstream is the scariest part.

But despite that it is one of the absolutely stupidest pieces of entertainment fakery I have seen in years. The music is bad. The lyrics are vapid and meaningless, the story is ridiculous and simplistic. But the sets, cinematography and the verve of the cast is admirable. Is it enough to make this film worth watching? No. Couched in important topical themes (poverty, AIDS, bohemian rebellion, alternative sexuality) and adorned with a set of characters and cast that are supposed to represent some kind of non-racial, post sexual revolution fantasy hipness, this film is a sanitized guided tour for rich heterosexuals who have never made any kind of artistic or social sacrifice so they can feel they've been cleansed by the holy waters of bohemian rebellion that they would never dare dip into themselves. Or perhaps its a vehicle to give the entertainment industry sufficient street cred to revert to the racist, sexist, class conscious crap that it prefers. Of course maybe its just a way to commodify and monetize bohemia which the entertainment pimperati can take to the hedge fund. Take your pick or combine any one of the these three motivations.

140,bgordon1234,Very good film but a little too long...,8,23 February 2007,"I won't go into any great detail because I really don't feel like it. Several standout tunes in this production/film include, the performance of ""La Vie Boheme."" I'd say when the latter is performed, the film reaches a real high point or climax. But after that performance, none of the other songs come close to reaching the excitement and entertainment value. This film went on too long and really could have been cut back by another 15 or 20 minutes. I found myself yawning frequently towards the end of this film because the story becomes just an endless parade of ""relationship stories"" and the politics of AIDS and other related issues becomes secondary.Otherwise, the performances are all standouts!

141,deetdee12,WTF was THAT???,1,11 March 2006,"I will confess I never (though I lived in NYC at the time) saw this on Broadway--and despite quite a few protests that the stage version was better, while it certainly couldn't have been WORSE, I can't imagine much improvement with those craptacular songs.Ironically, I would've been Bohemian-ish (at least somewhat) at the time this was set and I would've have nothing but contempt for a group of pretentious slacker junkies who couldn't be bothered to do SOMETHING to support themselves ethically. I also hung out in the East Village at the time...11th and Ave A was fully gentrified at least 6 or 7 years BEFORE this silliness even takes place. One of the first trendy restaurants, The Pharmacy (located at A and 9th) was well established by 1982, for crying out loud! Very few true struggling bohemians could afford the East Village by 1989.I found nearly every character thoroughly loathsome and painfully dim, as well. The only one I could stomach was Joanne, probably because really, she was largely an outsider and she had an actual gasp job!!!! Which she did without issues!!! Other things I found just repugnant: it was twice treated as completely hilarious that Angel killed a dog for $1,000. Akitas are LOVELY dogs, and animal abuse is sick and gross; Pseudo Bon Jovi was a recovering addict, yet everyone was overjoyed when he and perpetually jonsing Mimi become a couple--and given it was a previous girlfriend that had gotten him hooked in the first place--Maybe NOT such a good coupling; I noticed as they all patted themselves on the back at the bar (I frequented the real one, it looks nothing like that inside)for their avant garde status, they were completely loathsome to the wait staff...dudes, chances are the servers are boho, too---THEY just take responsibility for their lives. I bet all those %#@* don't tip, either.I rented this movie, since the awful (and yet still too kind) reviews kept me from wasting my $$$ at the theater.

As I remember I loved it, but had forgotten quite how much. I have become more familiar with all the songs, and I guess these had everything to do with it. What this film does is, I believe, not just capture the essence of the musical, it magnifies it. Musicals tend to aim at two showstoppers, one for the end of each half, numbers which leave you absolutely and totally in awe, making you stand up and cheer and clap and saying ""wow that's the best thing I have ever seen"". In Rent it seems like every song is a showstopper. As the chords for each one chime in with the recognition it is like a new delight, like when you watch Jersey Boys you think at the end of the first half there can't be any more great songs left in the catalogue but you are left open mouthed at the strength and depth. Wowzer! So, songs apart, 'cos tunes alone can't carry a movie.. The story is kind of unremarkable. That is not a negative, what I'm trying to say it is a tried and trusted formula, which is conducted more than adequately; this has a great deal more in common with I Daniel Blake than might be intuitively considered, SPOLER ALERT, employing the tried and trusted trope of the exploited underdogs overcoming the man and their own demons through bravery, initiative and unity against the odds. It is not happy endings all round, but there is resolution in a conclusion that garners ones thoughts, sympathy and fundamental satisfaction (I didn't say happiness there!). As for the dramatis personae, each single one of those eight people stood on the stage at the beginning has got it going' on, each one has a narrative that is a feast, arching through the whole film that had me hooked from the back-lit silhouettes and that simple piano. Look - I know, this is no way going to be everybody's cup of tea - but it IS mine, absolutely, totally hook line and sinker. It's in my top ten. It's in my top six. It will fade, but I just know that cosied up on that Friday night all on my lonely self and indulging myself in a coconut, a mango and a bottle of Chianti and this heart rending tragedy I have rarely, if ever, enjoyed a film as much.

145,davidgoldyn,Vapid and Hokey,2,3 December 2005,"I didn't understand the fuss over the Broadway Musical and I don't understand this film. Does anyone realize that the whole mess is lacking in credibility? Why should anyone let Bohemians live rent free in New York? Why should anyone live rent free? And who are these people? These characters aren't developed. They are simply the drag queen, the lawyer lesbian, the performance artist lesbian, the rock singer and why should we care about them? Simply because the majority is HIV positive? I think it's great that there are inter-racial couples and lesbians with the same jealousy problems as heteros. I think it's great that there is an interacial gay couple. I think it's great that the well to do black family sponsored a commitment ceremony for their lesbian daughter. But these characters are not developed and I care not a wit for any of them.The music is bland and uninspired. The choreography with one exception worse. The only number that worked was the dream sequence of the Maureen Tango. It went escapist like Chicago andthere was a moment I though it was going to take off. Then it crashed landed in vapid gritty reality called Rent.As for honesty, the only honest moment in the film when after a fight between Maureen and Joanne, Maureen's Mom comments to her ex-boyfriend ""Now you two can get back together?"" It was also the only funny moment.There is all that to do about Mimi breaking into the rock musicians window. She sluttily tries to seduce him and he puts her off and throws her out. Then he apologizes to everyone around him for being such an asshole last night. Well... some slutty woman breaks into your house and offers you sex and you say no and you have to apologize?? And not just to her, but to your roommate? Get real!Then Mimi seems to die but comes back to life because she as she says, she saw the light and the drag queen Angel was there and he told her to go back to the boy who was singing. Hokey. Then the drag queen dies and I feel nothing for him. I don't know him. He is a character (like all of them) that is undeveloped. Then I have to hear each person give a eulogy to this undeveloped character. Vapid and hokey.And that is the problem. For all it's supposed gritty realism, it's not really. Your'e HIV positive and so am I; let's fall in love. Isn't that just vapid!When i think of Rent, only one word comes to mind. Vapid. Oh and Hokey.",Rent
146,plegowik,What was the point?,1,7 December 2005,"This film was hyped up too much. What can it boast? Loud music, unappealing characters, and a plot that goes on and on and on and on ... until you wonder, ""Will it ever end?"" The plot isn't strong enough, the characters aren't characterized enough, and the songs, frankly, aren't all that great, except, maybe, for the theme song. Not one song scene stands out, except the maudlin, adolescent song the singer-songwriter composes during his time away . . . and that song, more than a performance, was excruciatingly embarrassing. The film leaves you with the idea that the bohemian lifestyle is the only lifestyle, despite the fact that it offers only freezing cold, dilapidated living spaces and solace in alcohol and heroin . . . but apparently using and being hooked on heroin is okay if you're a bohemian. The drag queen was the only character to stand out, and unfortunately, s/he wasn't allowed to carry the show!

As I watched the opening I felt that the movie could be good. The movie went on a depressing turn. The movie never seemed to come back from that point.

Compare it to Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, Guys And Dolls, etc. I'm sorry, I absolutely LOVE Broadway Musicals... Rent was no different, I saw it twice on Broadway, twice off, and I own the CD set.I heard about this Movie was reluctantly went with my wife, my sister, and brother-in-law. I was fully expecting a tanker... or at the very least, and experience far less emotional and exciting than the play. Boy, was I wrong! The Movie was stunning on so many levels... I was genuinely surprised at how it was lengthened (by adding lines/scenes not in the play) and it actually grabbed the audience even more than the musical. The visual flashbacks during songs alone was enough to add to the plot of the movie. The most dramatic scene is when all of the characters are dealing with issues between them, and Angel dies... unlike the musical, Angel's death is more dramatically shown. (I felt like the musical was more of a ""ok, Angel is dead"" type of scene, whereas the movie drew more of a picture of the entire road to afterlife, again by using visuals and flashbacks.) It was at this point that I found myself tearing up... my wife and sister were crying as well... the scene finally faded into a moment of silence and darkness. The entire theater was silent, except for a sniffle. I could definitely feel the emotion present at that moment... every single person in that theater was simply captivated by the movie. From the moment that Angel died to the very last scene in the movie, I had to wipe tears from my face... I am an emotional person, but when I saw the musical versions of this one, I was never so moved as I was by this movie version.If you love the musical Rent, please have no fear about seeing this movie. If you have never heard or seen this before, even more of a reason to be introduced to it. I would expect to see more people going to the play because of this movie.",Rent

Act I ends with the show-stopping song, ""1,576,800 Minutes,"" a tribute to the amount of time since the squatters paid their rent, as the bank's attorneys and sheriffs deputies descend upon our tragic figure. Act II details the foreclosure court proceedings, complete with the rousing number ""Personal Guaranty (The Deficiency Song),"" wherein a company of dancing loan officers reminds the man that all of his family's personal assets will be taken, too, to make up for any shortfall. Act III opens with the soulful ""Light My Candle,"" as the man, in an act of pure desperation, tries to burn down the building for the insurance proceeds, only to be foiled because the candle flame is extinguished when he throws it onto a urine-soaked rug in the squatters"" unit. Despondent, the man realizes he is out of options. The bank soon forecloses on the building, and the man is forced to file for bankruptcy, whereupon his wife leaves him, taking his daughter with her to live out of state, where he can not afford to visit her. In an ironic twist worthy of M.

Martin, Idina Menzel, Tracie Thoms, Taye Diggs, and Anthony RappChris ColumbusPG-13I've never seen the stage version of ""Rent"", and I don't have to. The movie version is enough to please me. In short, I loved it. I liked the performances, although some were flawed, I liked the songs, all though some were dragged out, and I liked the plain and simple direction.In the song and singing department, I really liked almost all of them. My favorites would have to be ""Take Me Or Leave Me"", ""Light My Candle"", ""Out Tonight"", ""Today 4 U"", and ""Tango: Maureen"". All very well sung by whoever was singing them.As for singerseveryone was pretty good, yet there were stand-outs. First of all, I'm going to say that Idina Menzel has got some lungs. She completely belts ""Take Me Or Leave Me"", and is quite talented in ""La Via Boheme"". Also a standout is Rosario Dawsonwho gives us two powerhouse performances. The first is the sexy ""Light My Candle"" and the next is the fun and hip ""Out Tonight"". Wilson Jermaine Heredia is a treat, too""Today 4 U"" works because of him, as it should. Tracie Thoms keeps up with the old school crowd, and works well in ""Tango: Maureen"".In the acting department, everyone does a decent job. Stand-outs are Rosario Dawson, Anthony Rapp, and Idina Menzel. Dawson is an absolute delight as Mimi Marquez, a truly complex character to play. Anthony Rapp is good as Mark, too. I don't know why he didn't get a Tony nodmaybe his perfy was different then? Probably. Idina Menzel is really good as Maureen, who is vain and self centered. Still, gotta love her.In the direction department, not much to brag about. I did like the simple form, though. It was veryplain. Most definitely the worst part of the movie, yet it's not too bad.GRADE: A- (The acting and the singing rocked, the directionnot so much) STARS: 3 And A Half Out Of 4.STAND-OUTS: Rosario Dawson, Idina Menzel, and Anthony Rapp BEST SONGS: ""Take Me Or Leave Me"", ""Light My Candle"", ""Out Tonight"".",Rent
153,jdavisbruin,"My Review: How Do You Measure, Measure a Film?",6,30 November 2005,"Being the good homosexual theater student that I am, I patiently waited for five-hundred twenty-five-thousand six-hundred minutes for the film version of RENT. Of course my expectations were high since almost the entire Broadway cast reunited for the film, and the film soundtrack (in my opinion) is much more enjoyable than the Original Broadway Cast recording. Sadly though, the film version of RENT made me more disappointed than seeing a horribly miscast and untalented thirty-something play the title role in last year's film adaptation of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.So what turned this Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning piece of theater into the worst film adaptation of a musical since A CHORUS LINE? I'd start by blaming virtually unknown screenwriter Steve Chbosky and director Chris Columbus as both obviously do not understand what the original stage version is all about.The stage version of RENT is a story of life, love, loss, friendship, andmost of allcommunity as told by a group of eight friends living in a modern day New York plagued by homelessness, drug addiction, and AIDS. One of the things that makes RENT such an entertaining piece is how the large chorus is used to breathe life into New York and to show that most people face the same kinds of problems as the eight principle characters. In short, the chorus is a pivotal ninth character that helps illuminate many of the play's themes, especially the theme of community.One of the grave mistakes of Chbosky and Columbus was the elimination of the chorus. By doing so, they fail to establish an environment that their main characters live in. Though the main players may bicker about the world they live in, they now appear totally detached from it, and thus the idea of community is now non-existent in the film.Chobsky and Columbus also have trouble establishing the relationships between their main characters. It seems like their main characters have been friends forever yet we as an audience never see how they become friends or why they're friends or even how important they are to one another. This doesn't seem to be a problem in the stage version, though, as the entire first act establishes how these people met and why they have such a close bond.And then there are the more amateurish problems in the film. Many of the crucial plot points and songs seem to come out of nowhere. For example, when Collins, an African-American professor at MIT, and his transvestite boyfriend, Angel, finally declare their love for each other in the song ""I'll Cover You,"" nothing instigates it besides--as far as I can tell--a short ride on the subway. If a subway ride is all one needs to feel love, then why are New Yorkers so cynical? When another character goes missing for a month, we don't even find out she's missing until a few minutes before she comes back. And some scenes just seem to have the wrong tone. When Roger, the HIV positive recovering drug addict sings a love song to his dying girlfriend, Mimi, the lighting and camera angles make him look more diabolical than loving. I would have expected him to slit her throat more than I would expect him to kiss her.But I'd say most of RENT's problems lie in the editing. Two songs which give us crucial pieces of information about certain characterssuch as the insinuation that Roger's roommate Mark is a closeted homosexual or that Roger's drug addict girlfriend, Mimi, needs to check herself into rehab or she'll dieare cut from the film yet were obviously shot as the songs appear on the soundtrack. These cuts and others like it make it very difficult to follow the plot or understand who the characters are. And while these crucial points are cut, we somehow need to sit through a second rendition of ""Seasons of Love"" and a reprise of ""La Vie Boheme,"" both of which come out of nowhere and don't serve the story at all. If things needed to be cut for time, those moments should have gone long before scenes that help us understand the characters or their problems.Still, RENT is somewhat redeemed by its brilliant cast. ""Law and Order"" alum Jessie L. Martin gives a charming performance as Collins. His rendition of the heart-wrenching reprise to ""I'll Cover You"" is enough to win him a Golden Globe nomination. Other stand-outs are Tony Winner Idina Menzel's energetic and hilarious performance as the trashy, constantly horny bisexual Maureen. Her rendition of the monologue/song/performance art piece ""Over the Moon"" is both nonsensical and laugh-out-loud funny all at once. And Tracie Thoms as Maureen's sophisticated, Ivy-League lesbian lover Joanne gives a brilliantly understated and demure performance. Their fierce duet, ""Take Me or Leave Me"" is easily one of the most enjoyable moments of the film, as is Thoms's duet with Antony Rapp's Mark in the ""Tango: Maureen."" But the biggest surprise of the bunch is Rosario Dawson as the optimistic yet HIV positive junkie, Mimi. Who knew that she could sing or dance? At any rate, she is a joy to watch, and her striptease number ""Out Tonight"" is a high point of the film.Despite the enjoyable performances by the cast, RENT is plagued by bad writing, directing, and editing. As I watched this train wreck I could picture the producers of the upcoming adaptations of DREAMGIRLS and HAIRSPRAY cowering in a corner. My advice when it comes to RENT: save your money for THE PRODUCERS, which will hopefully follow in the footsteps of better recent musicals like MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO. And if you must see RENT, well consider that renting that seat in the movie theater costs a lot more than renting the DVD will.",Rent
154,ericose,A wonderful adaptation of the stage version and the Opera,10,29 November 2005,"The basic story is the same as that of Puccini's masterwork, ""La Bohème."" That having been said, it takes place in New York in a year of the late twentieth century and contains all sorts of characters who mostly get along with each other: whites and blacks who all seem to be color-blind, straights and gays and one or two in between. You know some of the actors: Jesse L. Martin from ""Law and Order"" and Rosario Dawson to name a couple. The rest were mostly new to me, but the cast is top-notch from top to bottom.The music is sensational! Puccini is quoted from time to time (one of the characters even makes a sly reference to the Opera), but most of the music is typical of the period in which the movie is set. Even though I was not familiar with many of the songs, I found myself joining in with the chorus in a couple of songs. It's that much fun.SPOILER ALERT: My one quibble is that the ending is a cop-out; Mimi survives!

155,castrobear,RENT gets new LEASE on life,7,17 November 2005,"Turning this story about life, love and loss in the age of AIDS makes it's trek to the silver screen somewhat smoothly. The film does not disappoint, musically speaking it's just a wee bit wooden during the dialog sequences. The PG-13 rating of RENT will have some parents up in arms, after all, there is same sex kissing, drug use (with needles) sexual dance movements and foul language. It all works here but something tells me if Chris Columbus's name where not attached to this film, it would have received an ""R"" rating. It's kinda funny, TLA is releasing a small gem of a film called DORIAN BLUES about a gay youth and it has nothing near the adult content of RENT but the MPAA found it necessary to give it an ""R""...the distributor decided to sent it out unrated...the death knoll.Critic will have a field day ripping RENT apart, I hope they will be kind to this film, it just suffers from being over-ambitious.Expect church groups and conservatives to plan on loud negative reaction to RENT...a few people walked out of the screening in Sacramento (their loss).I will see it again and will purchase it on DVD.

Yet, despite my anticipation, I watched this film with impervious detachment, much like having a tooth extracted under local anesthetic.Columbus has cleaned up ""Rent"" for the mass-consumer audience. The set design is a candy-coated version of itself-- New York via Disneyworld. Likewise, the characters have no food or heat, but every hair is in place, every costume custom-fitted. Even heroin and AIDS are pristine, until the very end.Columbus has sanitized the musical score as well. While ""Rent"" has a couple of lovely ballads, the endless parade of songs, beefed up with a cheesy ""Rock"" orchestra, tend to grate on the nerves.I deeply admire Columbus's decision to cast most of the original Broadway ensemble-- too bad the film wasn't made ten years ago. These actors, most of whom are pushing pushing forty, simply cannot portray struggling artists in their teens or twenties-- at least not on screen. Rosario Dawson is a lovely addition, but she is no 19 year-old.The director should have taken a page from Marshall's ""Chicago"" (2002) and staged more songs on stage, as he did the opening number, ""Seasons of Love"".

Perhaps due to the brilliant casting of most of the original Broadway actors, RENT lived up to, and in some cases, surpassed it. I missed a lot of the omitted songs but I understand that it was decided to shave a few in lieu of dialog which fleshed out the characters and story a bit more. But, Goodbye Love, Christmas Bells and Happy New Year were great songs that are sorely missed. Rosario and Tracie were were brilliant as newcomers, but Adam, Idina, Wilson, Jesse, Anthony and Taye brought the passion and fire to the roles they created with a magic that is seldom captured anywhere other than live theatre.

159,jasonflum,From a self-professed Rent-head,10,23 November 2005,"I've loved Rent since I first bought the cast recording back in the fall of 1996 when it first came out. It was my sophomore year in college, and the CD came out on the day my parents were to drop me off. We went to a mall that day and I picked up the CD. I still remember listening to it intently that entire first semester - it barely left my CD player. I remember sitting in the hall with it blaring out of my room, people asking what that music was, theater friends learning the words to La Vie Boheme with me.Later that year, our theater club took a trip into Boston to see the first touring company. I sat WAY up in the balcony. Since then, I've seen the show in NY twice.I share all this because Rent is a part of my life. I know every note of the score, every word sung or spoken in the show. I have NEVER waited so eagerly for a movie to come out.I was not at all disappointed by this film. Most of the musical numbers are ""staged"" brilliantly, especially Tango:Maureen, Santa Fe, La Vie Boheme, Take Me or Leave Me, and Without You.*******Minor spoilers******** I was VERY disappointed that ""Halloween"" and half of ""Goodbye Love"" were cut -- I think this was a huge detriment to the continuity of the movies, not to mention two of my favorite songs. I really hope Columbus puts out a ""director's cut"" that includes those songs since they were filmed.****** end spoilers********** Overall, this is a fantastic version of the stage show. While it cannot hope to be better than the live version (and in my experience NO movie is better than the stage version of the show, with the possible exception of The Sound of Music), this is an excellent version of Rent.

Now about ten years later, I'm in a different place and I have to say that I'm sorry I missed the stage version.What this movie was incredibly successful in doing was showing people who continued to live their lives in the face of devastation, with gusto and exuberance. It was filled with hope. Sometimes we forget that in the face of something terrible, that life is too short not to live it fully. We may not agree with the lifestyle choices that these characters have made, but it's better to love than not to love at all. This is a life-affirming film, not some morbid celebration of deviant lifestyles and death as I had first perceived it ten years ago.The principal cast members were phenomenal, and I hope that this is a launching pad to bigger things for all of them. Amazing performances all around. I can only hope that Oscar comes knocking on Rent's door. Thank you Jonathan Larson, and Chris Columbus -- and a truly gifted cast.",Rent
164,pineapple_1013,A pretty good adaptation of a great musical,8,4 December 2005,"The majority of the points (8/10) that I've given this movie are based on the fact that the music was fantastic. There was new life injected into a lot of the songs, especially the title track, ""Out Tonight"" and ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"" All of the voices were fantastic. The original cast has lost nothing in the nearly ten years since they originated the roles, and newcomers to Rent Roasario Dawson and Tracie Thoms had strong voices that fit well into the mix. About half of the songs were choreographed and shot well, in my opinion. ""Rent"" worked well, as well as ""La Vie Boheme"", ""Out Tonight"", ""Light My Candle"", ""Take Me or Leave Me"" and ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"". ""Sante Fe"" was without a doubt my favorite scene as far as choreography, with Angel and Tom Collins doing a simple, but effective dance on the subway. Other songs, however, suffered from the ""we're walking and singing"" curse, notably ""I Should Tell You"", ""I'll Cover You"" and ""You'll See Boys."" ""What You Own"" came off kind of music videoesque, but the ending, with Mark and Roger's reunion, made up for it. Most of the songs that were omitted weren't missed, and, unlike Joel Schumacher's ""Phantom"", the lyrics that were turned into dialog were, for the most part, pretty well disguised and changed around enough so as not to come off sounding like painfully cheesy poetry. As for the acting. . .Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp seemed to have some difficulty transitioning from stage to screen (I know Rapp has done film before, but eh.) Anthony Rapp as Mark, while he did a really good job about 75% of the time, could have stood to tone things down a little, remembering that one doesn't have to act for the people in the back row, since the camera is in your face. He may have been doing it for affect, since most of the overacting was in big songs like ""The Tango Maureen"" and ""La Vie Boheme"", but it still was a bit much. Adam Pascal, on the other hand, went too much the other way and tended to be a bit stiff, although I've certainly seen worse performances. Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms were a lot of fun as lesbian lovers Maureen and Joanne, and Taye Biggs was fine as Benny, when you saw him, which was almost never. Jesse L. Martin and Wilson Jermain Hereda really made the show for me, though, as Tom Collins and Angel. ""I'll Cover You"" although it suffered from ""walking"" syndrome, was still one of the sweetest love scenes I've seen in a theater for awhile, and Jesse L. Martin's voice is heavenly. Finally, Rosaria Dawson as Mimi was a refreshing surprise, although I think she could have pumped up the attitude just a little more. Overall, I felt the story felt a little rushed. By eliminating a lot of the exposition songs and not really giving us enough insight into the character's motivations, I felt Chris Columbus separated us from the characters a little. In the stage show, you get a better feel for why Roger hates his life (the girlfriend had killed herself, not just died of aids), Mimi and Benny's history, and why Roger left Mimi (he didn't want to watch her die of aids and drug abuse.) It was handled alright, and I ultimately liked turning ""Without You"", which is originally a song Mimi sings when Roger has left her, into a song she sings while struggling to kick her drug habit. Ultimately, it was a moving story, but there's just something missing somewhere.",Rent

Absolutely masterful musical, though I always felt that the latter half was rushed.The movie version... a disappointment. In the musical, the curtain dropping could accomplish so much that the rapid visual scene changes, trying to fit in a panoply of images, sadly could not. The movie... a little over-produced, filling in too much detail that in the sparse theatric set was occupied by the audience's imagination.One of the biggest disappointments in the film was the loss of the ""homeless chorus"" in the musical, completely absent in the film. The lines centered on the musical's ""...and it's beginning to snow"" motif placed so much emphasis on the poor, which was in my eyes quite lacking in the movie.",Rent

It is obvious for this to succeed as a film and surpass or be as intriguing as the musical itself is to be visually ambitious and interesting. Sadly, not the case. Predictably, Chris Columbus comes in with a total lack of creativity and imagination and creates a diet version of the marvelous musical.I am totally shocked at this film's IMDb score. Aside from Rent fans giving it a high score just to support the Rent legacy, I can see no reason anyone who has seen the actual musical Rent wouldn't be very disappointed with this lackluster and poorly executed change of medium. It is also far too long for what it is.An ambitious project requires a creative, innovative and yes, ambitious director.

168,uptownrn,No day but today...,8,24 November 2005,"First and foremost I'm going to say that I am a very large fan of the original Broadway musical, so I had mixed expectations for this film version. I was afraid it would never measure up to the stage musical's emotion and power, and yet the casting of many of the original Broadway actors gave me a certain expectation of excellence in performances.The film exceeded almost all of my expectations. There were many changes made from the original musical, which I had heard about, and I was nervous about their input into the story. After watching the film I saw that these changes were necessary to make the story flow well on film. A straight filming of the stage play would make for an extremely awkward and disconnected film. By changing a few of the songs into dialog (Happy New Year, the Tune ups, and The Voice mails) it created a more solid world for the characters to live in.As for the performances, I have to say that I felt Rosario Dawson gave the strongest performance as Mimi. She played her not only as the sexy temptress or the tormented drug addict, she added the element of a vulnerability and an almost little girlish sense of being lost. Next to Dawson's performance in my opinion, Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel was incredible. He brought a life and energy to the film that added a feeling of realism and pity, in the second half of the story. While those were my two favorite performances I take nothing away from the performances of the other actors. The entire cast was extremely talented and gave very very powerful performances.All in all I have to say RENT was an extremely powerful and wonderfully made film. For fans of the stage musical I recommend going in with an open mind and holding it separate from the original. It is very different, but on its own, it is beautiful and moving.No day but today",Rent
169,gograyfirego,Start to finish,9,8 January 2006,"I asked myself if it was worth the price of the ticket? I will admit that I had never seen 'Rent' on stage. And so when my wife said she really wanted to see the movie, I only knew the story from what she explained to me. I said ""okay"" and we headed for the theatre. The music started and was very repetitive before any words were sung. Still, I thought ""Seasons of Love"" was good. Then ""Rent"" blasts away. I started to think that I was in for two hours of song and no story. Yeah...pessimistic, I know. Then there is some good story told. Hmmm...I think it's getting better. In dances Angel and ""Today for you..."" is terrific! Then I get a great kick out of ""Tango Maureen"" and I'm realizing this movie is pretty good. More (wonderful) story is told and suddenly they are dancing on tables and ""La Vie Boheme"" is incredibly invigorating!! And the story and songs just got more and more powerful!So, when all was said and done... my initial opinion changed. ""Seasons of Love"" is fantastic...in it's delivery and especially in it's message.Rent is a very special, wonderful movie!",Rent
170,ekaun,"Insulting, inhuman, and awful",3,11 December 2005,"After seeing ""Rent"" I left the Loews theater with feelings of disappointment and regret; but as the film admonishes its audience to ""forget regret,"" I found it fulfilling and ideologically consistent with the movie to switch to anger and resentment.In spite of the lack of satisfaction, I did learn several things from Rent:1. One needn't actually produce a work of Art (tm 2005, Rent Corporation) to be an Artist. Since all Life outside the Mainstream (tm) is Art, one need only record it (the medium and technique are irrelevant) and display it to have successfully avoided Selling Out.2. Being Creative is better than being in the Mainstream, and the two are in fact mutually exclusive. Keeping It Real doesn't refer to the Mainstream.3. Those in the Mainstream have surrendered Principle for a living death (because anything outside La Vie Boheme (tm) isn't living at all).4. Intensity of emotion trumps its direction, effects, or meaning.5. One needn't care enough about someone to change dangerous and/or hurtful behavior in any way, as long as one is Living outside the Mainstream; the resulting effervescence of Creative Love will redeem you in spite of illness, poverty, and their impact on your loved ones.6. Your loved ones would rather love you Super-Intensely for a period of months than love you In The Mainstream for a lifetime; your impending sickness and death will enable further heights of emotion, creating an unending spiral cycle of Intense Love for generations to come.7. It is far better to live for a short time as a Creative Archetype than to live a long time in the Mainstream as a Mere Human.8. A political protest need be neither political, nor a protest; it needn't be coherent as long as it's Creative, since those viewing the goings-on will either be In Tune or are The Living-Dead Corporate Enemy, in which case they are irredeemably evil despite their support for anyone in La Vie Boheme.9. Annoying Relatives in the Mainstream are so awful that they must be shunned, whatever value they might contribute or pain they might alleviate in La Vie Boheme; though Poverty is the main problem in La Vie Boheme, no amount of it is sufficient to warrant such extreme measures as Reliance On Family.10. Change is bad. There's no reason to change an artistically unproductive life, especially to something in the Mainstream, because if you're living La Vie Boheme, life is Art; artistic contributions are irrelevant.11. The rest of the world does owe you a living, on your terms, whatever they are. There's nothing one need do to merit such consideration, other than living La Vie Boheme; the Mainstream exists purely to support La Vie Boheme, though despite this reliance, the Mainstream deserves only scorn, derision, and contempt.A brief summary of the characters:Angel was a free-spirited, creative, ephemeral soul with colorful, outlandish mannerisms and a buoyant outlook uniquely identical to EVERY OTHER DRAG QUEEN STEREOTYPE EVER ON CELLULOID. See Priscilla Queen of the Desert for rich counterexamples.Tom Collins was sensitive because he got beat up, smiled a lot at Angel, and is also brilliantly quirky because he stole from an ATM he re-wired, theft being so much more fulfilling than any larger sums derived from engineering jobs in the Mainstream.Roger was a soulful Bon Jovi-ish artist minus the artistry and the soul. He at least contributed the worst song of the movie to resurrect his she's-not-quite-dead-yet love.Mimi exhibited a deft and precise bikini-wax during her dance solo, and covered with sweat during her cold-turkey drug withdrawal, verged on the Fiona Apple-esquire.Maureen contributed a delightful ass-shot, the spiritual zenith of the film. At that moment I wanted to go down on my knees and pray.Joanne was a control freak - we know she was, because Maureen sang so. Somehow, despite Mainstream mannerisms and a Mainstream job, she was Bohemian, because the others wanted her to be.Mark was the geeky filmmaker who decided to eschew Structure in favor of Passion. He completed his film (made by riding around on a bike, filming things) after quitting his horrific but seductive Mainstream job (driving around in a van, filming things). Evidently, the only obstacle to completing his film was developing raw unedited footage and shoving it on a projector reel.Rent did have some good tunes and musical performances, like nice paintings afloat on a sea of lightweight bile.Some things to which the word ""Rent"" applies: my soul after seeing the film my day after seeing the film my wallet after seeing the film what writing ""Rent"" earned plenty of for the creators what those who go see ""Rent"" often need to pay the old-fashioned way, in the Mainstream",Rent
171,epp678,Terrific Film...,9,3 December 2005,"I finally saw RENT last night. I have loved the OBC soundtrack since its release in 1996, though I have never seen it on stage. I admit I was not excited at the premise of a film version, until I heard 6 of the 8 principals from the Broadway cast were returning for the film, which gave the project a sense of validity that reassured me the film would be a worthy verison of the show. And it certainly was. I have heard some criticism that the film lacks focus, that it is not told from the perspective of a certain character etc. In fact, I think the film is nothing more than a filmed performance of the show - so really it is Jonathan Larson and his magnificent music that is the star (if you think of the opening credit sequence in that light this concept makes sense). And the center of the piece is Angel, how (s)he enters into this world and changes all who inhabit it. I thought Chris Columbus directed with great reverence for the show, and added enough to bring the story to life. The performances throughout are strong, particularly Jesse L. Martin as Tom (whose performance is so joyous, deep, and passionate it's as if he is purging 6 years of restrictive acting on Law and Order in one sitting), Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel, and Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson and Roger and Mimi. I did think that Anthony Rapp as Mark was a little too theatrical, however.While this movie was made clearly for RENT's fan base in mind, those with no familiarity with the show will still enjoy this movie. Go see it!!",Rent

It has been argued that HIV and AIDS is irrelevant in today's society, when in fact it is still very much present.They do still exist and RENT deals with that in a way which intrigues me.The characters, the acting and the plot all intertwine and this is one of the few musicals where I liked all the songs and could listen to them all day. Most of the time there is at least one song I dislike. One of the issues I did have with this movie was the casting but that was a minor quibble. There were some good performances put across.All and all, this movie is lovely, it really works and I would recommend it.",Rent
173,kjenkins,Not as impressed as the rest,1,12 July 2006,"I was excited to see that Rent was coming to the Big Screen. For years, I had seen ad-panels on the backs of taxis in movies for the stage show, and I heard that it had garnered rave reviews, great success and applause for many years from packed houses of New York theatre goers. Still, all I had actually heard of the presentation itself (other than that it was WONDERFUL from those who loved it) was the song 525,600 minutes. That sounded good . . . and the previews looked great. Still, I had no knowledge of the story or characters or . . . anything.Not being in a hurry to see it - still wanting too - I was going to wait until the second or third week to go. I hardly ever go on the first night; or even the first week unless it is a ""gotta see"" movie for me. When the second week rolled around Rent was nowhere to be found. In San Antonio it didn't even get shown at the dollar theaters after week one. I thought that was strange, but, not having the inside track, I figured I would wait till it showed up in video stores or cable, and so I did. I set the digital video recorder to capture the Pay Per View showing a week or two ago, and learned why the movie left town after a week. I only wish I had not invested the PPV money to see it.Realize that I have been to and lived in and around DC, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Houston, Dallas and more. I say this to point out that my views are not those of one being raised in Hooterville with no better ""learnin"" than the school marm could muster. I went to 17 schools before college, so I have some serious exposure to the world, and still found this one to be a dog.The story lines were simple, though convoluted, and even when the music was good - maybe even great at moments - the subject matter was, for the most part, so rank. Almost everything was dedicatedly off norm, and much of it was downright perverse. Of the topics and displays of eccentricity, the relationship between Maureen and Joanne was the most palatable, and between Tom and Angel the most unreasonable. The fact that the supreme example and definition of Love was a homosexual, pet-killing, AIDS terminated, Drag Queen says plenty about the motivations of the production, and why it wandered out of town so quickly, and so quietly.The only socially redeeming quality of the film, and I suppose the original story, was the fact that two of the characters that were HIV positive were intent on not taking on sexual partners unless they were also HIV positive. But that may just mean that the ONLY social guideline of the movie is that one should be unwilling to kill someone else for sexual gratification. Anything else is okay.So, on grounds of theology, ethics, morals, social message, and true value of human life, it scores a big ZERO, but some of the music is excellent, gaining them 3 points, still the messages of that music are so vile it loses them another 2 points - rending a final score of 1 out of 10.This kind of fare may pass for valid entertainment in New York, San Francisco and even LA, but most of America living outside the GLAAD universe would still find it to be both tawdry and mundane, yet more than moderately offensive - and not in a good way.Thanks for reading.

174,coffeechill,Rent Vs. The Producers. The jury's out.,7,26 February 2006,"The movie musical seems to have been revived after almost decades of non-existence. In the space of just 3 years we've seen 4 infamous Broadway shows translated to the big screen, dating back to 2002's Chicago and, now, the rock-opera ""Rent"".Let's start by assessing the source material for the latest Chris Columbus creation. In case you've been living in a hole the last decade ""Rent"" was a rock opera that premiered on Broadway ten years ago and continues to run to this day. The book, music and lyrics were written by a talented young composer named Jonathan Larson who spent 9 years putting his own personal experiences to paper in the form of a new Broadway show, only to die of an undiagnosed heart condition just days before the opening night. It was a cruel twist of fate that, perhaps, added to the musicals message of living each day and cherishing each moment to the last. His modern rock musical about struggling artists living below the poverty line and dealing with AIDS, drug abuse and money was the first of it's kind and really struck a chord with Generation X'Er's of the late 90's who could finally relate to characters in a Broadway musical. Larson was, posthumously awarded the Pulitzer prize for drama for his creation and the musical is considered a landmark in American Theatre.It seems ironic that two shows that, together, saved the life of the Broadway musical, should both be released as films in the space of 3 months. ""Rent"" brought the younger generation back to the Broadway Theatres while Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" brought back big business to Broadway and revived the musical comedy genre. It also seems ironic that these two films could, possibly, bring about the undoing of the MOVIE musical. (Both of these films tanked at the box office in the U.S.) However, that being said, it's not for lack of quality.Given the rich source material, the film adaptation of ""Rent"" already has a head-start. Larson's story, music and lyrics reek of commercial radio and PC but, at the same time, are strangely poetic and soaring. Your heart breaks for Roger during his performance of ""One Song Glory"" as he tells of the heartbreak of losing his former love to AIDS. However, at times his character does appear to be doing a Jon Bon Jovi imitation. He even looks like him right down to his hair and chiseled good looks as well as his vocal tone. There's even a corny part in the story where his character moves to Santa Fe and is singing in the desert that just smats of a Bon Jovi video clip. Likewise, your heart aches for Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin) who reprises his love song for Angel, ""I'll Cover You"".The film is led by a wonderful ensemble cast that gets every emotion and every musical nuance spot on. They are led by great performances from established starts Jesse L. Martin (Law & Order) and Rosario Dawson. However, the standout is Idina Menzel who's ""contemporary artist"" is a delight to watch yet is a tortured soul herself, unable to find anyone (man or woman) to love her for her.In terms of the screenplay and overall the direction, this film is a lazy adaptation. The Broadway show is deemed as a ""rock opera"" (the emphasis being on the word OPERA) with sung recitative written by Jonathan Larson. However, in the film version, the recitative is merely spoken which would be fine if some of the recitative didn't rhyme! It seems like the director or the screenwriter were caught between whether they were going to film this as it was originally intended or try and change it for the screen. An example of proactive thinking in this vein is 2004's ""The Phantom Of The Opera"" which was filmed as an opera with all the recitative in place. And while, for some part, it did seem a tad ridiculous, at least it didn't try and sugar-coat it's origins.Chris Columbus was NOT my number one choice for director for this film as the only other decent film of his (in my opinion) was Mrs. Doubtfire and, unfortunately, towards the end he lets the story dissolve into corny, schmaltzy sentimentality. However, putting that aside as a fan of the stage show I have to say that I found it an enjoyable, engaging and emotional experience at the cinema, despite it's flaws. Finally, the musical that defined a generation is preserved for us to share with the next generation and the next and the next...",Rent
175,travka79,Disappointing at Best,1,29 November 2005,"I really wanted to like this film. When learning that Chris Columbus was going to direct the play, I knew inherently the movie could not be as good as the play. The movie was unimaginative, boring, and forced. And while I liked the idea of casting the original members, they seemed too old for the parts, and even their voices seemed aged as compared to the original cast recording. Their voices lacked that youthful spunk I remember when first watching Rent in college. The musical score was changed and did not do the original score justice. Poor Jonathan. While Chris tried to portray New York's raw and gritty environment which came out (sort of), the cast members/directing made each character stand out from their surroundings rather than being a part of the community that Jonathan was trying to portray. Where were all the other drag queens? The other drug abusers? The other artists for god sake? Chris should be ashamed of himself. As a rock opera I think everything should have been sung like the play. Turning it into dialog made it laughable. And what is up with the side commitment ceremony scene between Joann and Maureen? That was just plain crap. I will say though that the message was there and anyone who sees the movie will come away with the message of peace and love no matter who you are or your situation. But as far as artistic value, it lacked depth and I only have the writer and director to blame.",Rent
176,landress,"So Much There, So Much Missed...",7,5 December 2007,"The direction and working of this film were mediocre, and that may be kind. However, they were truly blessed to work with one of the best scripts that Broadway has ever seen and some of the most artistic compositions to cross the Great White Way. You'll see in this review that the story and acting were both good, but in the end enough was missing to take it from a sure-fire Oscar winner to another also-ran that was barely worth mentioning.Jonathan Larson's script and compositions are there among the best and he gives us a story that is so moving that it would be hard to mess it up. The movie focuses on a group of friends, mostly from the viewpoint of Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp), a man giving up a nice life to live in New York and find himself as a filmmaker. He lives with a songwriter/singer named Roger (Adam Pascal) who wants to put out one great song as he is dealing with AIDS. Also entering the picture is Mark's ex-girlfriend/activist Maureen (Idina Menzel) and her new girlfriend Joanne (Tracie Thoms). Mark and Roger meet a woman who lives in their building, Mimi Marquez (Rosario Dawson), who is dealing with AIDS and a drug problem while working at a strip club to make whatever money she can. Lastly are two former roommates of Mark and Roger. Benjamin Coffin III(Taye Diggs) is a man who gave up the Bohemian ideal to try to create a film studio after marrying into wealth. Thomas Collins (Jesse L. Martin) has gone off to study/teach and returns to meet a companion of his own, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia). Mildly confusing, no? The story focuses on one year of their life, from Christmas to Christmas and what happens within that year. There are problems relating to AIDS, death, drugs, money issues, and a few love stories thrown in along the way. While it sounds like a long way to go for this, it is truly worth the ride.Most of the movie cast are simply reprising the roles that the created on Broadway. Only Tracie Thoms, subbing in for Fredi Walker, and Rosario Dawson, replacing Daphne Rubin-Vega, were not in the original Broadway cast. While the idea of bringing the Broadway cast with them from the show eased a lot of doubts about the movie, it also created a problem. The story is supposed to be focusing on a group of young men and women, in their early-to-mid 20s from what is being said in the movie (including the character of Mimi being 19 when we meet her). The problem is that these actors no longer look that age. That is only a mild detraction from the film.In fact, a lot of the acting is quite good. Despite not being in the original cast, Tracie Thoms is fantastic in her role and made you want to follow her character even when she was just in the background. Idina Menzel was quite good, although no longer truly seemed to fit the part in my eye. Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal know these characters inside and out and had no problem bringing that character back to life for the screen. Jesse L. Martin was very good, although the age factor seemed more noticeable with him than with any other character in the movie. Wilson Jermaine Heredia makes you entirely forget that he is a man in the movie and wraps himself around this character that he created. Finally, Rosario Dawson does an apt job as Mimi Marquez. She didn't seem to take a lot of risks, whether it was acting or vocally, but conveyed more than enough to complete the role.As I mentioned above, the problem lies very much in the directing of the film. Chris Columbus is a fine director, showcasing his eye in films like some of the Home Alones, Harry Potters, and the movie Only the Lonely. However, it feels too often like he is shooting a sequence of music videos rather than a film. This is never more prevalent than in his handling of the song ""What You Own"". The song is somewhat of an indictment on modern culture, somewhat of an escape song, a very nice piece. In the movie it has been turned into a roadtrip song, turning one of the only weaknesses in the script (a segment where a character leaves then quickly comes back) into almost a rock video.As I said, the material here is fantastic. With a better vision of the film, this could have been an Oscar contender easily. However, that is what separates the great from the good, and while this movie has moments of greatness, its not enough to overcome the partial mediocrity. 7/10",Rent
177,J2M1L3,Rent's Due!,6,29 November 2005,"This movie left me speechless. Rosario Dawson was fantastic, her performance alone pretty much made the movie for me. Though this movie deals with struggles and at times is very sad, and many people know that, you must accept that their are people out there who are like the people in Rent, and somewhere out there, this may be someone's story, with the exception that in the real world, people don't sing every two seconds, which also reminds me that the songs are fantastic.

178,Wicked_Lil_Diva,The best musical I've seen in ages,10,27 March 2006,"""How do you document real life when real life's getting more like fiction each day?"" asks Mark Cohen (played by Anthony Rapp), a young aspiring filmmaker and the film's narrator. It's a fair question to ask, even today- in this day and age it seems as though anything will pass for entertainment, from God-awful reality shows to publicity stunts by young, attention-seeking starlets just barely out of high school.Then came the film version of RENT.As a RENThead myself, I was a little concerned about how this movie would be brought about. After all, I first heard about it back in 2002, when Justin Timberlake announced in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine that he was ""in talks"" to play Roger (played by Adam Pascal in the original Broadway production) in the film. Thankfully, casting directors thought better of it and instead brought back six of the eight original Broadway cast members (Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker were too old to recreate their original roles, and Rubin-Vega was pregnant at the time). Newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms did a beautiful job in this film. Dawson's acting is top-notch, and Thoms does a wonderful job displaying her incredible vocal range during her solo in ""Seasons of Love"".I believe Chris Columbus preserved the sentimental message of Jonathan Larson's story quite well. RENTheads and Broadway purists alike condemned him for changing around a couple of things and even cutting a few numbers. I'll admit that even I was a bit peeved that ""Halloween"" and the second half of ""Goodbye Love"" were cut from the film (though they do appear on the DVD as deleted scenes), but I understand that a lot of the other songs from the musical were more suited for the stage production than the movie, and they also would have been superfluous, even cutting some of the heartbeat of the film. Let's just be thankful it wasn't Baz Luhrmann directing this film- look what he did to Moulin Rouge! and Romeo + Juliet.The quality of the music is also vastly improved in this film. Compare the original motion picture soundtrack to the original Broadway cast recording. In the original Broadway recording, you can barely even hear the bass line, and several of the cast members are struggling to sing the songs, even doing potential damage to their voices by screaming. The original cast members' voices are improved in the film, and Dawson and Thoms contribute to the film with their musical talents.The story is based on Puccini's La Boheme and centers around Mark Cohen, his flirtatious ex-girlfriend, notorious, attention-seeking protester and musical performer Maureen Johnson (Idina Menzel), her lesbian lover, lawyer Joanne Jefferson (Thoms), HIV-positive dancer Mimi Marquez (Dawson), her lover and Mark's current roommate, HIV-positive guitarist/songwriter Roger Davis (Pascal), Mimi's friend, HIV-positive cross-dressing drummer Angel Dumott Schunard (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), his lover and Mark's ex-roommate, HIV-positive philosopher Tom Collins (Jesse L. Martin), and Mimi's ex-lover and Roger and Mark's friend-turned-landlord Benjamin ""Benny"" Coffin III (Taye Diggs). The film takes a look at a year in the life of the eight friends as they struggle through hardships such as heartbreak, drug addiction, financial troubles, disease and loss.One of the greatest musicals ever. Ten out of ten!",Rent
179,luvturtled,Oh My Gosh--Awesome!!!,10,22 November 2005,"I, as with other recent reviewers, have found that the film version of Rent lives up to the stage version and adds a well-roundedness that only enhances the story. I was very skeptical, as RENT is my all time favorite play. I won tickets to a screening and am so happy I was among the early viewers. I laughed and cried (I never cried in the 5 times I have seen the stage play)-- all in all, it was spectacular!!! Even if you are not aware of the stage musical, you will find something to relate too because their is a character for everyone. Take friends, and go for it--I promise you will not be disappointed!! Enjoy the movie, the songs, and the words that are spoken and sung--the cast is amazing and electrifying.",Rent
180,gapeach1004,Don't Listen to the Critics!,9,26 November 2005,"Don't listen to the critics. From what I gather, they went into the movie expecting a movie and this is clearly not that. This is a musical placed on the big screen. They wanted acting and dialogue, a whole bunch of dialogue, but this is not that. This is acting through singing. This is a musical. Walking out of the movie, my sister said she thought the movie was awesome. We went into the restroom and two girls of middle school age said ""That movie was the longest I've ever seen and it was silly."" OK, the movie was more than 2 hours long, but Titanic, Gone with the Wind, Lord of the Rings...they were longer (to name a few) and I bet they have seen at least one of those movies (care to guess which?). The movie was not silly at all, it's just that some people don't understand what a musical is. A musical isn't a bunch of people reciting lines to each other. It's people singing the story. You rarely see musicals get good reviews and in my opinion, it is because people are not looking at them for what they are. The music was great. It wasn't ""I'm going to tell you the movie through these lyrics."" They were real songs that ended up telling the story. I thoroughly enjoyed the musical. I wanted to see the play ever since I saw the ad in Newsweek so many years ago. I couldn't make it to NY to do so, so this is the next best thing (Oh, I still want to see the play, but if I never get to I will be happy knowing that I saw the movie). It has that certain quality that has me walking out of the theater wanting to buy the soundtrack and I will.",Rent

183,danielletbd,Falls Short of the Play but Still Amazing,8,23 November 2005,"WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERSIf you have never seen Rent in any form, I urge you to see the play first. The movie captures the spirit of Jonathan Larson but must dumb it down a lot to comply with FCC standards that gave them their PG3 rating. Songs are lost (""Halloween,"" ""Contact,"" ""We're Okay"" and most disappointingly ""Christmas Bells"") and others are turned into spoken word dialogue (""You Okay Honey,"" ""New Years Eve""). In other songs, some of the characters are removed (such as Joanne in ""Rent"" and Angel in ""You'll See Boys"") in order not to confuse the audience. The opening sequence of the filmfrom the cast standing on the stage at the Nederlander through the most expensive four minutes in a non-action film (the singing of ""Rent"")sets the tone perfectly. The quick cutting and loud rock edge introduces these characters the way the play doeswith no holds barred as they toss flaming pieces of paper out the window. The camera work is flawless here, as it is throughout the film, with high crane angles, sweeping jib motions, and the smooth pans of a steadicam. It is perfect.Unfortunately the rest of the film doesn't quite match that initial tone: suddenly ""New York"" became very colorful and brighta bit too well-lit and jovial for a serious story about relationships and hard times falling on a group of friends. While film was shot in 2.35 ratio to give the effect that you are still watching a stage performance (and thus you can see a great deal of the scenery around the characters), none of the subsequent scenes are as dark in texture or as high-energy (in terms of production value) as the opener. They put everything into it and came out spent, taking a breather in ""You'll See Boys"" which pretty much holds two camera positions throughout the dialogue and song. The pacing never found its flow: it jumped around and felt extremely rushed at the end as montage after montage was used to explain events that passed in the 525600 minutes of these friends' lives. For example, Mimi was only seen as a true addict throughout at the last few moments; up until then she just appeared like the majority of young New Yorkers in the art scenea dabbler, an experimenter. What was the most upsetting to me, though, was how the play was an ensemble cast, with Mark as a narrator throughout. The film tried to duplicate that but fell short: by cutting solo songs for Joanne and Angel, they became secondary characters. The balance was never retrieved. I'm not quite sure what Christopher Columbus actually did with this film: the cast didn't need much coaching, as the majority of them originated in these roles, and those the characters were already theirs. Each and every one of them gave an impeccable performance. Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography (as always) was complex and beautiful and added to the vibrant world, especially in ""Life Support,"" when the camera took a 360 around the circle, always over the shoulder of one member to another and never once losing focus. Only once did it distract from the moment: when Mimi has just come back from nearly ODing she and Roger are sharing a moment, and they are in the far left corner of the screen, leaving an evenly spaced Maureen and Joanne to fill the middle and right side of the screen, and leaving the eye to naturally be drawn to them, even though it is a clear moment for Mimi. However, the fact that I can't find Chris Columbus in this film is not, by any means, a negative comment: he is no auteur, and if he tried to make too great a mark, he would have ruined the film. Don't get me wrong, though: just because I am being critical does not mean I did not enjoy my time in the theatre. I saw the film at 12:01 AM on November 23rd the very first showing on the west coast, and I was surrounded by other true Rent fans. We cheered, we clapped, we sang along, and we mooed with Maureen (as we should have). I am perhaps overly critical of this film not just because I work in this industry but also because I had such high expectations for the filmbeing such a die-hard fan (I saw the play on Broadway six times before I moved out of New York and once in LA since). Jesse L Martin was especially endearing: he took Tom Collins to a new level and clearly had a lot of fun doing it. The high moments of the film (other than the performances) were the almost ""Chicago's"" Roxanne moment in ""Tango Maureen,"" ""La Vie Boheme,"" (even though they took out parts of it) ""Take Me Or Leave Me,"" and ""Without Me."" Rent will make you laugh, make you cry, and most importantly, make you feel for and relate to its main characters. To some the subject matter is still controversial, but at the core is the most endearing and heartwarming story about true friends that I have ever seen. Rent is a great film, but an incomparable play. They should set up a three-camera shoot at the Nederlander and put that on DVD.",Rent
184,FosseFilmGuy,Just as good as the play.,10,19 December 2005,"""Rent"" was absolutely excellent! While Jesse L. Martin appeared a little old for his role, he still put on a great show along with the rest of the cast. The film gives you more of a New York City feeling (not discrediting the play). Seeing members of the original cast was a wise choice rather than having popular celebrities that can't sing, dance or act. I'm disappointed it got snubbed at the Golden Globes, being that this was one of the best films I've seen all year! The ""life support"" scene in the film puts things more into perspective, seeing in full detail the experiences AIDS patients go through. I liked they didn't sing every single word like in the play, slightly overdoing it. Indina Menzel is absolutely beautiful, Anthony Rapp had great charisma, I sympathized greatly with Adam Pascal's character, and the rest of the cast added to the warmth and compassion that made ""Rent"" so great. Forget ""King Kong"", ""Rent"" is the giant that should take over New York City because it's all about New York City!",Rent
185,Tucker2007,Don't,3,21 August 2016,"If you're not one of those weird theater-crazy hippy types then this movie probably won't be for you. Personally I don't like musicals that much to begin with, but there have been some that I've enjoyed despite that fact. The South Park movie and Sweeney Todd for example. This movie however made me want to never see a musical ever again. The songs are so clunky and just.. bad.. It's like you'd have to be on a butt load of pain killers to enjoy songs like Seasons of Love. Seasons of Love should be the theme song for the Mormon faith; it's so cheesy, uninspired, and makes you want to puke because it's so overly happy. ""One Song Glory"" makes me want to punch the nearest breathing thing in the throat. It is such an annoying song that it irritates me just writing about it. I don't remember a whole lot about the story since its been a few years since I've seen this movie. Mostly that everyone has AIDS and owes rent money from last year. Also that guy wants to write a good song so he'll be known after he dies of AIDS. Other than that I got nothing. It was boring and painful to watch.",Rent
186,Orator33,"It's got the singing, the acting, but still disappointing...",6,30 November 2005,"I confess... I went into this movie with my hopes high. Not through the roof, but pretty high. And unfortunately, I was rather disappointed.This is a movie about a group of friends, obviously struggling through very hard and difficult times, in New York, 1989-1990. It's about prejudice, injustice, betrayal (not to an extreme extent but it's there) ethics... but mostly about being able to live ""alternative"" lifestyles without being judged; not being confined, repressed or subjected to others' standards. A varied group at that. You have the aspiring film maker Mark (incidentally my favourite character), recently dumped by -- the attractive and sought-after Maureen... who left him for -- a pretty lawyer named Joanne. -- You have Roger, song writer/guitar player, trying to finally write a song, and struggling with the fact of a dead girlfriend among other things. -- You have Mimi, the exotic dancer/addict at 19, who lives one floor below. Roger's *eventual* love interest. -- You have Collins, the former professor and now... I'm not sure what. (Nice character, but if anyone else got to really *know* him, I must have missed it.) -- And ""Angel"", the (occasional?) transvestite and symbol of sympathy, forgiveness, love, etc. Actually a rather likable character. -- And you have Benny, the once friend who got married and turned (somewhat) against them.Did I leave anyone out?The acting was really quite good. I won't say I've never seen better because I have, but for what the movie was *supposed* to be, all parts were played more than usually well. The singing was *REALLY* good. In my opinion. I liked everyone's voice quite a bit. My favourites by far were Mark, Roger and Maureen (Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal and Idina Menzel). But really, I was surprised by how much I liked every voice.The songs... I honestly loved or at the very least *liked* a *lot* of them. There were some I didn't care for, or thought could have been better (for instance when they kept chanting ""No day but today"" it got a bit annoying and I started wanting to cram socks in various mouths).So, what was disappointing? The movie. I was really enjoying myself for about an hour, then somewhat suddenly I realised that I was getting impatient and a little bored. After an hour and a half (guessing) I began checking my watch with some frequency, and telling my sister (who was feeling the same way) that it probably had only 45 minutes, 30 minutes, etc. Which started seeming like a long time. *Not* a good sign.All in all, I'd say I liked at least half of the movie, or more. Even after it started to really drag there were several parts that were good. I didn't cry... but I did tear up a few times, even.I've never seen the stage show, and hadn't heard all of the music before watching this movie, but I'll say that it made me positive that I will get a recording of it. I might even spend the money to see the stage show, if I ever get a chance, just to see how it is different and if it might not be better on stage.I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 not because I enjoyed it so much, but because of the superb singing, good acting and a lot of fantastic songs.",Rent
187,dogshowaddict,Social norms always evolve!,7,23 November 2005,"I'd like to recommend that RENT fans go and look at the discussions under Anthony Rapp. One thing that struck me is younger posters stating that their parents make a nasty issue of the lifestyle representations, extreme emphasis on AIDS (forgetting that this is based in the late 80s) and drug use in this show. Geez, during Puccini's day, don't they realize that the original La Boheme characters were decadent, too? Go take some time and look at the list of characters in the opera and match them up with the names in Rent. Very interesting. La Boheme contains old fashioned Marxist critiques of capitalism and a variety of snide attacks on Western civilization. Now, assuming here for a moment that Puccini was not attempting to lampoon the Bohemian lifestyle (something which I still believe is possible), then that opera represented one of the earliest examples of anti-Western diatribes with which many of us have come to dread in modern art.Except for the capitalist ""Benoit"" in the opera/""Benny Coffin"" in RENT, the characters are typical coffee house intellectuals who spend most of their time glorifying their superior, anti-materialistic credos and denouncing the greed and avarice of the bourgeoisie. ANTIDISESTABLISHMENTARIANISM The ""heroes"" bounce between biting verbal attacks on ""the rich"" (especially La Vie en Boheme"") and sarcastic jabs at ""the system"". While the context is more ""old Left"" (i.e., 19th century labor union-style communism) instead of ""new Left"" (i.e. modern political correctness), the fundamental philosophical worldview is there for all to see.On another note, I hate it, but I guess it's typical for my community: the 3 musical and one verbal reference to ""Quando M'en Vo"" brought chuckles from me, but I'm CERTAIN that no one else in the theatre got it!

Twenty percent was right in the middle, doable, with even some of the corn and predictability factor being forgivable. Maureen's ""art"" just plain sucks, and is the most glaring example of the play not translating well to the screen. The remaining forty percent is what you go to see - stellar, touching, rock your socks off in both good ways and not so comfortable ways.The story itself doesn't show a lot of muscle, although the thread of continuity is fair. Look to the vignettes for the worthwhile punches which, though they are sporadic, are definitely there.There's an inherent risk in any movie where most of the dialogue is sung, that being if you don't groove on the song you won't have a feel for the scene and it will dilute the point.

What I liked most about this movie, I think, was that despite the dismal, horrible conditions these should managed to not only survive, but to thrive, and to be passionate about life. RENT shows the true meaning of passion. It is so rare these days to find people who are so passionate about something they love that they would devote their lives to it. So often we hear people telling us to pick a certain career because it pays well, or has good benefits. The characters of RENT have defied popular, cultural and logical standards of life, and have forged their own live comprised of all the things they love and all the things they are passionate about. I LOVE La Vie Boheme because it is just a list of the elements of their lives! It is so beautiful, and yes SO much fun! I laughed, I cried, I've felt things I've never felt.See this film. Even if it's ""not your style"" or you find certain themes offensive. See it anyway. It might change your perspectives on some aspects of life. It might show you something you never knew before.

I just left the auditorium after seeing it's first show at my local cinema. All I can say is WOW. The director made me laugh, made me cry, and made me genuinely care for these characters. It was especially interesting to see how comfortable people in the auditorium were with same sex kissing. That just shows you how well this story is presented. When it ended, I wanted to jump back in line and watch it again, which I never do (and always criticize those who say such things!). Bravo, Chris Columbus.

194,mje2k,"Will I keep my dignity, will I get my three hours back?",1,17 May 2008,"I saw Rent in Toronto in 1998. At the time I was 37 and far too old to be a part of the generation portrayed in the film. I didn't understand a moment of the show because the singing seemed to be on fast forward and 12 to 15 decibels for three hours. I bought the soundtrack and really liked the music. But the characters and their shallowness left me cold.Ten years later I just happened to flip on the TV on a Saturday afternoon and this cinematic cesspool is on the FX Channel. And I realized what was wrong with this film.Actors are far too old to play the roles that made them a hit on Broadway.Characters should get off their whiny behinds and get a job.This film has a curious case of Attention Deficit Disorder. Other reviews have already mentioned this but there are huge patches of the film where there should be musical underscoring and lines sung in a recitative. These are sacrificed for excruciatingly long pauses and spoken dialog. Case in point: The scene where Mark visits the AIDS support group, on stage this passage went but in a few seconds, but on film it seems to take hours. In that same scene, one of the funniest lines 'I'm a New Yorker, fear's my life' had the pacing of a lump of wet clay drying in the sun.The director could not direct traffic let alone try to put a Broadway show on screen.And as it has been mentioned before on IMDb, these people have no talent and it is very hard to feel sorry for the train wrecks that their lives have become. They alone got themselves into their mess, so who can care about them when they are living in warehouse sized lofts in lower Manhatten and don't want to work. Get a damn job you lazy slackers.And then there is the dancing in the streets. It worked in Godspell and West Side Story but but looks a little ridiculous.

Few examples: a songwriter who is unable to write a single song, a ""filmmaker"" who has no idea, no concept, no talent for film-making... I mean at the end when they show his edited work, it is so pathetic you have to feel sorry for him. And on top of that they are all oh so artistic, such good people... so much drama... And the music.

Some songs were cut (half of ""Goodbye, Love"" and ""Halloween""), others were moved to new places (""Seasons of Love"" was moved to the beginning of the movie), and new scenes were added. This was not tragic; there were simply some things that a movie could not pull off.Mark Cohen, a filmmaker, and Roger Davis, a guitarist, live without heat in an apartment in the ""Alphabet City"" region of Manhattan. Mark is dedicated to making a documentary about people with AIDS and homeless people, and Roger is obsessed with writing a great song before he dies; Roger is infected with HIV. Mark and Roger's neighbor is Mimi Marquez, a dancer at an S&M club, the Cat Scratch Club, and a drug addict. She attempts to start a relationship with Roger, who continually refuses her, at least until he learns they share something in common: they are both HIV-positive. Mark and Roger's former roommate is Tom Collins (""Collins""), an ex-professor at MIT who is also HIV-positive. While back in Manhattan, he is mugged. Angel Dummott Schunard, an HIV-infected male transvestite, comes to his rescue. The two soon start a relationship. Another ex-roommate of Mark and Roger's, Benjamin Coffin III, married into a rich family and is threatening to evict Mark, Roger, and all the homeless and other tenants from their neighborhood. In response, Mark's girlfriend, Maureen Johnson, stages a protest. However, some time before the protest (and the beginning of the movie), Maureen dumps Mark and begins dating a lawyer, Joanne Jefferson.The plot is not specific; the story is more reliant on themes. Time is one theme. Mimi, Roger, Collins, and Angel all have their clocks ticking. Love is another. The characters have their relationships, while Mark, having been dumped, is alone. A final theme is celebration; seven of the characters have horrible things going on in their lives, but they are able to celebrate the good things along with the bad.And then, there's the music. The songs are spectacular. Even the bad ones are good. And, they have meaning. ""Seasons of Love"" and ""I'll Cover You"" are about love. ""Rent"" represents hidden ferocity. ""One Song Glory,"" ""Life Support,"" ""Will I?,"" and ""Without You"" are depressing and anguished. ""Light My Candle"" and ""I Should Tell You"" are delightfully flirtatious. ""La Vie Boheme"" is all about celebration, and ""Tango: Maureen"" is humorous. And, ""Your Eyes/Finale"" is the glue that ties all the songs together.Having seen the movie an immeasurable amount of times, there's one thing I'd advise you to notice in the second half of ""La Vie Boheme:"" Mark's dancing.

The best actor in that movie was the transvestite named Angel and Taye Diggs, and that is simply pathetic.

Every single actor shined in his/her role... even Rosario Dawson as Mimi Marquez (Who knew she could sing and dance like that!)... I loved the fact that they used most of the original cast (Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs, Anthony Rapp) and you could tell that the cast were close in real life. They all had great chemistry on screen.The message of the movie was wonderful and I found myself tearing up, laughing along, smiling, sighing and gasping throughout. I felt connected to the characters, they felt very very real to me.In short, excellent film. I would recommend it to any musical lover.",Rent
200,SalamancaChica,Absolutely fantastic,10,14 August 2006,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. The screenplay and score are ingeniously arranged and the cast did a fantastic job portraying their characters. Musically, this movie is innovative, well-sung, and certainly unique. The soundtrack is moving in itself, but the film adds so much dimension to the emotion in the songs. I found this film truly moving, and incredibly inspiring.I would definitely recommend it for teens and adults, though it involves mature themes that are most likely not suitable for children in the eyes of most parents. There is no film quite like this. Absolutely fantastic.",Rent
201,JPOmalley,"Good, Great? Hardly Perfect.",7,27 November 2005,"Rent is a musical that could have, if anything benefited from a movie. It is gritty, real, at times absurd, but rife with film-y potential, if done correctly.Chris Columbus (Need I remind you: director of Bicentenial Man) succeeds more often than not in creating gorgeous musical moments that, well, connect to something and I would be lying if I said I felt nothing leaving the theatre. I was moved. But I also know the show and the movie was not the show. Here's where Chris Columbus fails.For once, can someone have the balls to create a filmed musical that DOES NOT break from the music. I gripe more about the Titanic disaster that was PHANTOM OF THE OPERA than this. But if people are willing to pay $100 a ticket to see a musical with no dialogue, why wouldn't they be willing to pay $10. It is as though the producers fear that America has eaten itself RETARDED and thus won't understand RENT without explanatory dialogue, but they would have and the lack of dialogue wouldn't have ruined the pace of RENT as the ""words"" do in the film. Unfortunately what RENT becomes is a ""greatest hits"" film of the best moments in the musical, with the occasional benefit of finding out how a character gets from point A to B, in silence.My dream would have been for RENT to never stop, from beginning to end, unless (and this would have been great) they threw and intermission into the film. If it worked for Sound Of Music it could have worked for RENT. Unfortunately Chris and Co. doesn't trust itself, or its audience, to make a perfect adaptation. They are fine (as is the audience) with a compromise. I would just like to remind them that no one else gets to make another version. There's sticks, and I am sad to say, disappointed.The cast however was incredible and Jesse L. Martin should be applauded and lauded with gifts. End of story",Rent
202,GaryRifkin,A tribute to a great Broadway musical,9,23 November 2005,"I can't speak for those who have never seen RENT on Broadway, but for those who are familiar with the story and music, this is a beautiful tribute to a Tony Award winning show. It's no Chicago, but it's no Chorus Line either (thank God!). Jesse L. Martin gave an even more powerful performance than he did in the original. And Rosario Dawson is quite fitting in the Mimi role. Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp still have that great chemistry that reminds us that a true family is often made up of those you choose.From the opening ""Seasons of Love"" to the closing ""No Day But Today"", the music carries the film and the viewer through a roller coaster of emotion. I dare anyone who has beloved friends to not connect with these characters.Go see Rent - No Day But Today!",Rent
203,TwyliteCreature,Rent's about love of all kinds,9,19 March 2006,"I liked Rent when I first saw it but during the first viewing I was distracted, thinking more of the music as just music, and of the plot in a kind of simplistic way. But after watching parts of it again and again (at first because I liked the songs), I understood it so much better and how it has so much meaning. I love the music/lyrics for one thing, and the overall message is so strong and momentous. Unlike musicals like Moulin Rouge (though well-acted and amazingly beautiful), Rent had more of an appeal to me. Maybe because it was less about just love, like the whole ""I will love you until my dying day"" theme in Moulin Rouge, and more about dealing with life and your outlook on your time here. Love is woven tightly into the whole story, but not simply in a romantic kind of way. Rent's about love of all kinds and to me that makes a much bigger impact overall.",Rent

I understand some things like the first song, need to be changed, but cutting out the phone messages, rearranging them, changing words, for a ""Rent"" head, is a death sentence. I think the movie is great, don't get me wrong, it just has a lot of room for improvement.I'll give it a 4/10 Great visual style, but overall lacking in the lyrics department.

205,jamessoh,Excellent movie,10,24 November 2005,"The first time I saw RENT was in San Francisco. My initial experience was negative because the live production was just awful. Bad acting and singing were just some of the things that really turned me off of the production. However, while watching the play-musical, I got a sense of the core of the storyline and came away thinking that RENT probably was significantly better on Broadway. (Hence the nationwide tour of the production.) Anyway, fast forward to today to RENT the movie. For starters, the movie camera enhances the storyline of the musical, quite often adding multiple dimensions to many of the songs and the storyline itself. Obviously, the stage can present only so much physical presence. But, more important, the movie production of RENT kept the core essence of the musical play and exploited the living hell out of it in the movie with great precision and elegance. There are, in my view, so many ways to reinterpret RENT for a movie production given the added liberties of using a camera. However, I was surprised and quite often pleased with how much the movie production stuck to the musical storyline. I sat in the audience often making comparisons to RENT the musical play and the movie I was watching in front of me in my head. Critical as I was while watching the film, I could not help but think how great a job the movie turned out to be. I would argue and suggest that the movie is better than the Broadway musical itself, even though I have never seen the Broadway show. The music, singing, acting, and direction melded brilliantly and elegantly to do what movies should do regardless of how insane or silly or fantastic the storyline: it transplants you to another place for those 60-120 minutes. It may be easy to discuss the storyline of RENT, but one has to watch it (in theaters) to really understand the essence of this production. I came away from the movie understanding what Larson intended to say, not just a few love stories running in parallel in the setting of harsh living conditions of New York.",Rent
206,Sprocketeer,Very good adaptation. A bit of heavy-handedness prevents perfection.,8,5 December 2005,"This film was very good. It would have been better if they had gone with Baz Luhrmann as the director instead of Chris Columbus. A LOT better. Baz would have known how to advance the plot without resorting to typical heavy-handed Hollywood-hit-em-over-the-head-until-they-get-it montage sequences. It is this heavy handedness that makes me give it an 8 instead of a 10...The makers of this film had a hard job. They needed to take an excellent, but very New York and artist oriented story, and make a film which would appeal to the masses of middle and southern America (USA).. masses which cower in fear and disgust at the mere mention of sex and drugs... Sorry guys, it is not possible. The easier you make it for them to digest, the less you tell the story you came to tell. It is more than a little ironic to compromise artistic integrity in telling a story which is more than a little bit about being yourself and NOT compromising your integrity. The story was already somewhat reduced to stereotypes in the making of the show.. and did not benefit from further simplification. However, my complaints are limited to just a few aspects of the film. It could have been a lot worse.End of the day the theme of the story is universal and should not have to be manipulated to appeal to one segment or another.All that said, the great performances and music in the film save it and make it into an excellent adaptation despite these directorial flaws. The book was very well handled as was the music, with great arrangements. The music was well worked into the story. Some music from the show was cut or made into dialog. But it was done very tastefully. The photography was excellent as was all the stagecraft and lighting. Some of the shots again were a bit obvious, formulaic and manipulative, I don't know whether the director or DP should take the blame for this. Other shots were very funny and creative, and overall it was good. So I think I'll blame the director...I was well acquainted with the story before seeing the film. I have seen the show (once) and have the CDs (listened to many times)... and still got a bit teary at times in the film. Which shows the power of this story and the performances. 'Nuff Said.Personally I enjoyed the film immensely, and think most people would enjoy it. Great date flick, though maybe not for a first date.On the other hand if you have an extreme hatred of musicals or feel disgust at the mere thought of homosexuality or drug use, you might have a problem with this film. In which case maybe you should see it anyway, maybe you'll learn something...",Rent
207,desperatethespian,"Emotionally vapid, far too long, deeply disappointing",6,24 November 2005,"Let me preface this mostly negative, disappointed review by unequivocally stating that I am a huge fan of Rent, the Broadway musical. I'm not quite as big a fanatic as some of the serious Rentheads out there, but I've seen the show at least half a dozen times, and know virtually the entire score by heart (I even got through several rounds of auditions for Mark many moons ago.) I _LOVE_ Rent, it's a beautiful, heart-warming, invigorating, stirring piece, THE musical of my generation, and the emotional wallop and resonance it has doesn't diminish with time or repeated viewings.Those accolades are, I'm afraid, reserved for the musical version alone. The film, despite featuring virtually the entire fantastic original cast is disappointing, disjointed, detached, and -- a word I'd never think I'd ever associate with Rent -- downright boring. How can this be, considering the film is about as faithful (if not moreso) to the original as any book-to-screen or play-to-screen adaptation I've ever seen? I'm not quite certain. The best I can come up with, without attributing blame to any one facet or member of the creative team, is a blanket, sobering statement that this is a dramatic work of excellent art that was simply never made for the screen.The version of Rent that swept the 1996 Tonys and has taken the world by storm over the past 9 years was very likely never intended to be the 'final cut'. It's quite possible that had Jonathan Larson lived out a full life, (or at the very least, another 525,600 minutes...long enough to see the previews on Broadway) he would have made significant changes to the structure of the book and score. But the tragic circumstances of his death resulted in the script to be treated as something sacrosanct and immutable. Consequently, Rent has something of a discombobulated arc, uneven development of certain sub-story lines etc. But seeing it performed live (and if you never have, you're doing yourself a disservice) with a first-rate cast, music booming and blasting through the rafters, incredible dancing, and emotion oozing off the stage mitigates any structural shortcomings. Rent is such a spectacle, it is such an electric, awesome experience, that you're willing to suspend disbelief and look past certain things. On film, where much captivating element of the experience is muted, the holes are more glaring. It just doesn't play well.Part of that has to do with the nature of the medium. We've grown accustomed in the last few decades to considering film to be the most 'realistic' portrayal of reality, or at least a heightened reality. In the theater on the other hand, we're far more inclined to be forgiving. On stage, two characters who don't know one another at the beginning of a song can be in love at the end, and that's completely plausible -- we don't give it a second thought. In a film, even a musical film, it's just plain weird. When Mimi is deeply hurt by Roger's spurning her after meeting him only once and begs him to reconsider, it works fine on stage, where it can be assumed that much that we have not seen before our eyes has progressed either between or during the song. In the film, which by it's nature strives to portray a certain reality (even if characters break into song every few seconds), it's just odd. Even more odd is director Chris Columbus' choice to have main characters sing in the background of scenes that they are ostensibly not a part of. On stage, that's not something you notice...your eyes are focused on the principal characters in a scene, and your mind forgives the otherwise unusual presence of others lurking in the background providing a little vocal boost. But when the camera pans over the faces and does closeups -- for an extended period of time, mind you! -- of uninvolved characters like Collins, Angel, Mark et al. during Mimi's early scene begging Roger to let himself be with her, or during the 'private' fight Maureen and Joanne have at the commitment ceremony, it's just plain bizarre. What are they doing there? Are they some kind of bohemian Greek chorus? A big part of the reason that your mind is allowed to wander and ponder such things is because Rent the movie just doesn't mesmerize you like Rent the Musical does. There's just something about seeing people singing their hearts out loud live, an orchestra pumping out melodies that envelop the theater, that's absolutely riveting. Angel's death scene in the theater is heart-wrenching, on film it's only mildly disturbing. Mimi's near death is a cathartic, climactic moment, in the film, when she gets up and they all immediately decide to watch Mark's movie and sing, it plays like something out of The Naked Gun or Police Academy. Angel's introductory dance in the theater is amazing, no matter who's playing the role. In the film -- despite being performed by the originator of the role -- it drags on and on. And as you sit there watching the images passing before your eye, your foot tapping excitedly to a tune you've heard a thousand times that sounds familiar but somehow isn't eliciting the same response you've had every other time you've seen it, you start to wonder...how come these guys are all so friendly to one another? Does this dude normally jump into strangers' houses and dance provocatively? Would straight guys not flinch if a transvestite they didn't know burst into their house and start provocatively shaking his/her hoo-ha in front of their face? And when exactly did all those buddy-buddy relationships between Maureen and Mimi, Angel and Benny, Joanne and Roger, Maureen and Angel etc. develop? We don't even see them meet and they're all best friends? This is the kind of stuff you don't notice or care to notice on stage...but in this long, drawn out production, your mind starts to wander...",Rent
208,rkt-1,RENT packs the emotional punch,10,8 December 2005,"""Rent,"" as directed by Chris Columbus (of ""Home Alone"" and ""Harry Potter"" fame), takes a huge step in the ways of cinematic and emotional film-making. Staying true to the words and beautiful music of Jonathan Larson, Columbus crafts a wonderful film around a talented group of actors (many of which appeared in the original stage version) and builds a world so believable and watchable, that you cannot take your eyes off of it. Rosario Dawson and Adam Pascal seem to have a very believable bond, as well as Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms. However, the finest acting happens between Jesse L. Martin (""Law & Order"") and Wilson J. Herredia as the most loving couple of the film. The connection these two make blew my mind, and I shed many a tear during the powerful final act. Add all of these factors up and ""Rent"" seems to make the grade. Columbus surprised me with his deft hand at directing such emotional and difficult material. Coming from the age of ""Home Alone"" I figured a normal Columbus-esquire feature. However, he has finally become the filmmaker I always wanted him to be, making a film that is important, powerful, and heartfelt. 9/10",Rent
209,harmonium_303,highly energetic and incredibly moving,10,24 November 2005,"I had been anticipating the film version of ""Rent"" ever since I saw the teaser trailer with Seasons of Love in it. I bought the Broadway soundtrack and later the movie soundtrack, and became instantly obsessed. When opening day for the movie finally came, my friends and I were so excited to rush out and see it. Needless to say it was one of if not the best musicals I have ever seen, and also incredibly emotional and moving. All the songs were great, I was lip synching them throughout the movie. ""Today 4 U"" is one of my favorites; its when we find out that Angel is a cross dresser, and his number is so fun and energetic its hard not to tap your feet along to the music. My favorite number in the entire movie was of course ""Out Tonight"". Rosario Dawson's dancing was so hot I actually found myself gasping out loud. ""La Vie Boheme"" was definitely an energetic piece, with everyone dancing on the tables in the Life Cafe, singing about what they love most about being bohemians. ""Over The Moon"" had just about everyone in the theater cracking up, Idina Menzel is too great for words. Not only was the music excellent, but so was the acting. I felt that everyone did a great job with their roles, especially Rosario Dawson as the heroin-shooting S&M dancer Mimi. Many ""Rent"" fans doubted her at first, but she was incredible; her drug scenes were so convincing it was like watching real footage of someone struggling with addiction. Jesse Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia were the standout couple as Collins and Angel. Their relationship was so sweet and innocent that it was painful to watch, knowing the future of the couple. Everyone was in high spirits and enjoying the movie, and then came the ""Without You"" montage and the reprise of ""I'll Cover You"", without a doubt two of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in a movie. The finale where Roger sings ""Your Eyes"" to Mimi had everyone in tears once again, and after ""Finale B"" had the cast belting out ""No day but today"" and the credits came one, we were all so emotionally drained that no one moved. After a moment we all applauded this truly wonderful film. This is one of the only movies I want to see again in the theaters, and I hope to soon. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't like musicals. It deals with issues that I feel people need to hear about, such as friendship, tolerance, and of course the AIDS epidemic and what can be done to protect yourself from it.",Rent
210,satiricalharpy,Deeply emotional message and spirit shines past sometimes awkward transition,9,24 November 2005,"There is no doubt in my mind, even after seeing the movie, that Rent is truly for the stage. That bond between cast members and even the characters and audience is essential for its message (one of the reasons I was glad they kept on most of the original cast members). However, it was not the awkward moments in the movie (of which there are a few notable ones) that I was left with, it was the spirit.Though very much an ensemble piece, there were a few performances that stood out to me: most particularly Jesse L. Martin, Rosario Dawson, Anthony Rapp, and Idina Menzel. Let's face it, Jesse L. Martin IS Tom Collins, and he steals every scene that he's in. I cheered when he entered the room with a delightful ""Merry Christmas bitches!"", wriggled with happiness throughout both ""Santa Fe"" and ""I'll Cover You"", and actually, for the first time, cried in a theatre during Angel's funeral. I was delightfully shocked by Rosario Dawson's performance as Mimi. Though the ""Light My Candle"" number seemed a little dull, she completely won over the audience (especially the male half) during ""Out Tonight"". Anthony Rapp and Idina Menzel, who originated the roles of Mark and Maureen onstage, clearly should be in front of a camera more often. Rapp quietly breaks your heart as the lone bohemian who is forced to choose between selling out to corporate America and freezing to death, and can put a smile on your face by simply raising an eyebrow at an appropriate moment. Menzel exudes total and utter confidence from the moment we first see her on screen, and along with Martin is a complete scene-stealer.The rest of the cast are fine for their roles, but not necessarily memorable. Thoms deserves credit for taking over the part of Joanne, but considering her lengthy screen time, didn't win me over until ""Take Me or Leave Me"". Adam Pascal seems to think that the key to successfully transitioning from screen to film is to lose all emotion and facial expression whatsoever, so I was prone to ignoring him when he came on screen (I also suggest, that if you feel the need to pee during any point in the movie, do it during ""I Should Tell You""). Heredia is fabulous as Angel, but really only shines through when opposite Martin.The main criticism I have heard for this adaptation is that it's too clean (something I do agree with). Columbus did a beautiful job with direction and cinematography, but you leave it feeling that it should've been... grittier. Especially when the core members interact with the rest of the people in the city. But then again, that may have not been what Columbus was going for, and the direction he chose to go in works.All in all, I'd say it was worth the eight bucks. Do yourselves a favor and go see this movie. Or if you already have... go see it again.",Rent
211,Pythonman,Rent is beautiful.,10,27 November 2005,"I've seen the show on Broadway. It's about a group of Bohemian friends- Mark, the dumped Jewish cameraman, Roger, a musician who's HIV+, Mimi, a dancer who's also HIV+, Collins, a computer wizard with AIDS, Angel, a transvestite street drummer, Maureen, a sleazy bisexual activist, Joanne, a lesbian computer technician in love with Maureen, and Benny, once a friend of Mark and Roger until he married money and bought the building they live in.Basically, it's about the trials and tribulations of these groups of friends fighting mature problems such as AIDS and trying to get enough money to pay rent. Very little was changed from the original- some of the songs were changed into dialogue in order to appease the people who wouldn't want to sit through 2+ hours of nothing but singing and dancing (the Broadway play is a rock opera). An understandable move, if you ask me, but it's very weird how they transferred it all to the big screen.Now then, I'll list some pet peeves I had of the movie: 1. 90% of the dialogue used to be song, but they changed it for said reasons. The weird part is that the song lyrics they said in dialogue with little of it changed. This is weird because I've listened to the soundtrack a lot, so I'm used to the songs.2. Some of the songs they just dropped out with little intact. You'll notice they didn't have that little ""Christmas bells are ringing"" ditty, for one thing. I don't really understand why, though. They also took out ""Halloween"".3. They should've gone more into Angel's death. Yes, I realize she had AIDS and was bound to die, but it pretty much lept into it without an explanation of what happened. In the original, she died around the song ""Contact"", but I forgot much of the play, so I don't remember what happens then.4. In one scene (particularly the ""La Vie Boheme"" scene), Maureen actually moons the audience.5. Wait. That was a good thing.6. It made me cry too much. I hate crying.Despite these quirks, yes I loved it. The songs were greatly choreographed, and I was not disappointed. And don't listen to the critics- I love the songs.9.5 out of 10.",Rent

If I were a member of the motion picture academy, I'd want to nominate Heredia for supporting Oscar -- he was that good. The material was not groundbreaking, a little too much triteness and a few too many clichés, with a lot of evident influence from everything and everybody from the Beatles to Lloyd-Webber to Meredith Wilson, from ""Evita"" to ""Sgt Pepper"" to ""Oliver"" to ""Fiddler on the Roof.""

I have never seen a movie quite like this. Covering many issues including homosexuality, AIDS, loyalty, friendship, drugs, and poverty, you can find at least one thing or character you can relate to. I highly recommend this one. The original cast was inspiring, as well as new-comers. It opens with the well known song, ""Seasons of Love"", on a bare stage, much like that of the stage production, and then branches right into the lives of the bohemians. From there, you begin your emotional roller coaster ride. It keeps the intensity to the very end. In the theater which I saw this movie, the screen went black, and there was utter silence in the room. Everyone was speechless, wiping tears from their cheeks. I highly suggest this movie.

It was very well acted, and although there were things cut from it, it wasn't really anything majorly important. One of the things I loved was that the people around the main characters reacted when they burst into song. It wasn't treated like nothing weird was going on, like many musicals do. It really helped with the suspension of disbelief that you need when watching any musical. The actors all played their parts very well, and their singing was, in general, good.

Having been some of the Rent Heads that saw the play on Broadway and while it was with the New York Theatre Company, I came away from the movie thinking that Jonathan Larson would have seen this movie and then went back to the drawing board and fashioned his stage play more like the movie. Jonathan spent seven years re-writing his play because people kept telling him that the story line just was not right. He hit it enough to make thousands of hearts love this play. He got the right story line enough to make me and thousands of us to fall in love with the musical. Like his parents say, ""This adaptation hits the mark!"" I agree. Also, his death gives light to Mar-Phan Syndrome. A disorder that has taken it's toll on my nephew, who has a leak in his aortic valve. Jonathan died from an Aortic Dissection, probably caused from Marphan Syndrome. The same thing that I worry about for my nephew. I wish that he could have seen ""HIS"" movie!

Of all the films I've seen based on Broadway musicals, this is the best!!!! Not only does it reunite many of the original cast members, it also relives the most memorable songs, mainly ""Seasons Of Love"", ""Take Me Or Leave Me"", and many, many more!!!! Also well done to the new cast members, Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, the Mimi and Joanne, for joining the cast and creating such brilliant characters. (The same can be said for the others too; as always Idina Menzel is hilarious and unbeatable as Maureen, Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal are the same Mark and Roger they always were, and always will be.

223,twilightfades33,great adaptation.,10,22 November 2005,"For those of you who are hell-bent on seeing the Broadway show true to form on the screen, there isn't much anyone can do to convince you of how good this film actually is. I went to a free advance screening on November 19th (sponsored by some magazine) and there was a line out the door of people wanting to get in - they had to turn a lot of folks away. I attended with a friend who is only familiar with ""Seasons of Love"", but after it was over, there were tears in both of our eyes. Rosario Dawson was wonderful, and dare I say better than the original Mimi. Surprisingly, Jesse L. Martin is the comedic relief of the piece (well, Wilson Jermaine Heredia helped a great deal in that department) and Tracy Thoms was wonderfully understated.There are some minor adjustments to plot, and a few songs left out (some that I missed dearly, hopefully they'll be on the DVD), but overall, the movie was fantastic. My friend's ability to connect to the characters so quickly assured me that it was not just my familiarity with the story and music that made me a fan of the film. Chris Columbus doesn't botch it too badly - I could see how the direction could have been much worse - but there were some awkward cuts that were kind of frustrating. In my opinion, the highlights were ""Santa Fe"", ""I'll Cover You"", and ""La Vie Boheme"". All three pieces were snappy and cute, and pretty well choreographed. I'm definitely going to pay to see it again opening day.",Rent
224,MightyPeacelover,"Better to see the show, but worth seeing.",7,26 November 2005,"The best attribute of this movie was in that most of the original cast was back reprising roles that they have become identified with. Unfortunately, the producers saw fit to (mis-) cast Rosario Dawson as Mimi. That proved to be a discordant note throughout the film, much like her singing. Most amusing was her singing Mimi's classic line about her rear end - which, even with the most generous camera angle, simply was not believable. The acting was otherwise excellent. Adam Pascal assumed the role of Roger as if he'd never left it, and the sheer enthusiasm shown by Collins early on in the film was wonderful. The other main characters transposed their Broadway personae readily to the film version. There were a few changes in the overall script, some minor in order to show time progression, and some that simply detracted from aspects of the show. It was especially visible in the relationship between Roger and Mimi, where several key elements from the show were eliminated or simply dulled, one might suppose, to gain more screen time for the only movie actress in the film. Sadly, these were not beneficial to the film. Most egregious was the pointless scene at the Cat Scratch Club, where Mimi's explanatory song for Roger (per the show) became a track for an unnecessary and pointless striptease dance. All in all though, it's worth seeing for the majority of the cast, several great harmonies, and the occasionally inspired moment. It should be recommended more as a rental than a $10.00 plus night out. Watching the show is infinitely better than this. In essence, it's worth watching because it is Rent, but is simply less than the show itself, the essence of which it only captures sporadically.",Rent

Don't get me wrong, I love Idina, but she has a lousy speaking voice. Anthony just looked awkward. I'd have gotten an original cast instead. Still, a great movie, and the songs were phenomenal. Jesse Martin, Tracie Thoms, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson were great. Another small problem was that there wasn't much dialogue. There was a bit, but at one point there were 3 songs in a row, which I felt wasn't that good.

It seems that there has been a revival for musicals in the resent years, so were starting to see more of them. When Rent came out on DVD we thought that we could give it a try. We could not stop laughing. I understand that this was supposed to be some sort of a drama, but it was one of the funniest movies of the year. The songs sounded like someone made them up on the spot, they wanted you to feel sorry for people who are getting evicted from there homes but refuse to get a jobs, everyone has AIDs because they don't protect themselves or they share dirty needles (stupid people), and one guy must film it all.

Chris Columbus's direction gives vitality and colorful visuals, and also grittily realistic stuff to the heartfelt, beautiful music and lyrics of Jonathan Larson.Rosario Dawson's performance as Mimi is one of the many highlights of Rent. She brings a cat-like sexiness and verve to the role, and an underlying vulnerability. Her character feels like a real person with real flaws. Idina Menzel, who i knew from Wicked, is pitch-perfect as Maureen the bisexual performance artist. She makes the character so ditzy and yet manipulating, and also feels like a real person. Everyone in the movie had great voices, and were all wonderful actors. As Chris Columbus said, ""Thank you, Jonathan Larson.""",Rent
229,lifeisnteverything,Magnificent,9,7 December 2005,"Being something of a Broadway geek, I was fully prepared to criticize the film version of ""Rent"" in any way I possibly could. I was ready to rip it apart, frame by frame, and let everyone know that it trashed a Pulitzer-winning musical. What I was completely unprepared for, however, was that I'd have no need to do so. ""Rent"" succeeds on almost every level.The plot follows a year in the life of eight bohemian friends in late '80s New York City, and the various ways in which the year changes them. Some find--and lose--soulmates; others discover the capacity to live life more fully, while they still can.I was particularly incensed with the casting of Rosario Dawson as the fragile stripper Mimi, but I was blown away by her explosive performance; she exhibits a go-for-broke streak in the role that surpassed my expectations by a mile. The other notable standout performances were Wilson Jermaine Heredia, playing the HIV-positive drag queen Angel, and Jesse L. Martin as Angel's lover, Tom Collins. The two displayed a delicate, flirty chemistry that worked well for their duet ""I'll Cover You""; later, at Angel's funeral, Martin imbues Collins with a palpable, heart-wrenching grief as he reprises the song alone.Director Chris Columbus wisely cut out most of the play's through-sung dialogue; its inherent theatricality can be difficult to sell even on a stage, but in a film it can be disastrous. Mimi and Roger (Adam Pascal) have a sung-dialogue duet on ""Light the Candle"", and it is, in fact, the film's low point--I even remember thinking, ""God, I hope the rest of the film doesn't suck this badly."" Other than some minor anachronisms--the film is set in 1989, yet Angel sings about ""Thelma and Louise"", which didn't come out until 1991--the film is superlative. I encourage everyone to see it.",Rent
230,kongzi02,A reproduction that does justice to the original,9,24 November 2005,"I've been a Rent fan for a while now and have seen the show several times. You can probably imagine my reaction when I heard they were bringing it to the 'big screen.' First, I was ecstatic. This is by far my most favorite musical, so to see it finally get made into a movie was a dream come true. But then I had feelings of concern. What if they do it wrong? For anyone who's seen the show, the subject matter is intense, the songs are powerful, and the stage design extremely functional and almost an organic part of the show itself. Well, we're now in a new millennium and the subject of AID's and poverty are nothing new to us today, so this concern flew out the door.Now, about the songs... the songs are simply awesome and require vocalists that can handle them. When I heard they were getting the original cast, I knew the vocals would be there, so no worries. I know that you purists out there were wary about Rosario Dawson joining the cast as Mimi, but let me tell you, from the first rendition of 'Seasons of Love' to the final note of the Finale, all cast members were phenomenal. The original cast didn't miss a beat, and I was particularly moved by Jesse Martin and his portrayal of Tom Collins. His vocal performances brought chills to my spine. Rosario Dawson proved to be a suitable addition. I didn't even know she could sing! Her performance in the role of Mimi would make any true Rent fan proud.Finally, there was the issue of the stage design. The fact that the show had to be made more realistic by placing it in a real city setting, made it impossible to keep elements of the original set intact, but there was a scene that had the metal mosaic structure that all Rent fans would be familiar to. Other than that, the setting was a city and various locations within it. Any time something has to be brought from a confined setting to a more open one, there are adjustments that have to be made. You have to change the blocking performed by the actors and make use of the larger space. You have to add dialogue or space things accordingly to accommodate a sense of reality with the surroundings. Basically, there was a slight tinge of weirdness as the cast would be walking around the city, sitting in a subway car, or hanging around a restaurant and then BAM, go into a song and dance routine. Sometimes, the transitions weren't very smooth and almost a bit funny. You could tell that Chris Columbus and his crew had some problems figuring out the awkwardness, but once you realized this was a musical, all was forgiven.When going into this movie, people just have to realize the differences between the big screen and the small stage and the adjustments that have to be made to move from one to another. People should keep that in mind when watching this movie, or they'll miss the point and enjoy the passion behind the music and story less. To those who have seen the actual musical, you'll realize that nothing can beat the original, but I will admit that this comes very close to matching it... So go check it out!",Rent
231,brian-olsen,"If you hate yourself, watch this movie.",1,24 September 2006,"This has been one of the worst attack of the senses that I have watched in awhile. I left the television on to see if I can take the pain throughout the movie, and somehow I managed through it.The musical scores are hokey. The characterizations is dry and undramatic. The characters themselves are worthless people living a worthless life and somehow deriving a drama over people so self-centered, so individualistic, it would make me wish that all the characters would just drop dead in the middle of the movie. Maybe if these beliefs conflicted with a sense of dramatic purpose, a drama where they emerge from their petty nothingness and become something, then maybe this film would be worthy to watch.But, of course, if this thing had *meaning*, then the original play and the subsequent movie wouldn't be so popular like it has become. Apparently, it shows a lot about a culture based on the entertainment they pursue. In this case, when we uphold the values of people who serve no purpose but to whine and complain and feel that the world entitles them something over those who actually do something to progress, then there is something really wrong here.I'd give it a zero if there was an option for that, but for what it is worth, a 1 gives it some credit. It does though, to me, have credit. It has to be the humor factor, the factor that people would actually spend a lot of money to create a jarring mess like that and can actually make money off of it. For that, I would then say that this was brilliant.",Rent

233,jgrosspjc,Comparing the Incomparable,7,30 November 2005,"Matching the expectations of Broadway rendition enthusiasts would be difficult under any circumstances, let alone in the case of an operetta heralded as the breakthrough musical of the nineties, set in the eighties, and delivered in a 2005 screenplay. But that's precisely what director Chris Columbus achieved in Rent. It works in no small part due to original cast members playing 7 roles of the 9-member-chorus including Law and Order's vocally gifted Jesse Martin as the aids infected, she male-filial, and deeply soulful Tom Collins. As for the newcomers, much acclaim has rained upon the beautiful and exotic Rosario Dawson while Traci Thoms as the aristocratic African American lesbian lawyer, Joanne Jefferson enhances her character and upgrades the company despite the irony of her 9 unsuccessful auditions for the stage role. Open-minded viewers will find themselves treated to MTV-video-like vignettes that enhance the highlights (Santa Fe), awaken the yawners (Glory) and when appropriate, replicate the original stage (Seasons of Love). In both versions, the show stopper was Idina Menzel's plot turning ""Over the Moon"", in tribute to the lost art of ""Performance."" The instrumentals were somehow mixed and mastered to provide maximum impact and ambiance causing viewers to bop in their seats, a rare movie theater experience (compared to 1979's screen betrayal of Hair). The unusual combination of original cast, video drama, and powerful instrumentals however did not completely overcome the time-travel faux pas as in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. The ""same sex"" engagement party and Brooklyn's eye view of the still-standing World Trade Center were gratuitous references to the future. Awkward moments where the operatic libretto was changed to scripted dialog formed speed bumps that were aptly handled by omitting certain numbers. If this was necessary to reach audiences who would not otherwise see Rent,the ends justify the means. On balance, the film is a worthy tribute to the very best of Broadway though lacking the Oscar potential of Rob Marshall's Chicago.",Rent

I had to realize that it wasn't an R rated movie so it had to be edited for some content. This musical was brilliantly captured on film by Christopher Columbus. The translation from stage to screen couldn't have been better. There were some disappointments (i.e. song changed to dialogue, etc.) but for the most part it was pure fun had by all. I took my sister to see it and she absolutely loved it. The transition from song to song was so smooth it felt like a concert of my favorite band. The Tango Maureen was perhaps my favorite scene in the movie. I won't spoil why for anyone but I thought it was brilliant the way that captured that particular scene on film.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll be dancing in your seat with the amazing songs. Jonathan Larson, God bless his soul, was a genius and a heartfelt writer, and I feel Chris Columbus met his genuine integrity in a way that would do Jonathan proud while still tugging at those heartstrings.

All the actors were amazing, especially Rosario Dawson and Idina Menzel. I am still thinking about the ""Take Me Out Tonight"" performance by Rosario Dawson. Whether you saw the play or not, should not affect how you like this movie. I mean it basically follows the play format but don't think that since you haven't seen the play then you can't see the movie.

238,AbsolutKeen,good representation,10,1 December 2005,"I thought it was a good representation of the stage version. Although it might have helped to have added an intermission. I know that's rare in a movie but with the subject matter and clear placement for one (after La Vie Boheme as in the stage version) it would be a chance to stand up and stretch and of course get more concessions (the plus for the theaters). Rosario Dawson definitely rises to the challenge although her counterpart, Adam Pascal didn't quite do as well. I have seen him on stage and HE WAS AMAZING b/c you hear everything in his voice and body, but in a movie with so many close-ups, his face just didn't communicate in the same way. Maybe he went a little to far on the ""I'm numb to the world"" side but that's just my opinion. Anthony Rapp deserves SERIOUS kudos b/c he managed to hold on to the movie and his character even in background moments. Also, Idina Menzel is a goddess. That pretty much explains her performance. ""Take me or leave me"" (except for the opening Seasons of Love which I could watch a thousand times) is definitely a show stopper. Even though I didn't mention the rest of the cast it's b/c there were all so wonderful I can't add anything that their performances don't say for themselves...go see it!!",Rent
239,Swish8,"10 Years of Hype make me go ""Eh?""",6,8 April 2006,"OK, so after ten years of Rent hype and I never did get to see the musical, I finally get familiarized with Rent through the movie version. Maybe it's that I was a high school freshman when Rent first came out. That I'm of Generation Y rather than Gen X, but I was a bit disappointed. Not with the performances or the songs, but a little bit with the story line.The Mark character I think irked me the most. I kept wanting to tell him to move back to the suburbs with his mom and dad and try to figure his life out. Whine whine whine! I was actually happy with his character when his talents pay off and he lands a real job, only to find that he is disappointed and unhappy that he ""sold out to the man"". Selling out? Why is it so horrible that he had a chance to become successful? And he just whined his way through his job like it was so horrible to actually have to work for a living. I kept thinking, ""Why do they refuse to pay the rent? Everyone else has to."" Then he quits his cool job to finish his crappy home video ""film"" he made of his friends. I wanted to hit him over the head with a newspaper and say ""Dammit! You quit your job for that?!"" Not to mention his friend had real problems, like dying of a deadly disease. What was he so worried about? Even Tom's character, who is one of my favorites, at the end of the movie states that he isn't teaching at NYU anymore but wired an ATM to steal money. And we as the audience are supposed to exchange high fives with the characters for that? Yeah,it was a little dated, but no big deal. You wait another few years and dated becomes retro and it's all good. Besides, I viewed it as a period piece. But it is a period piece whose themes (SOME of them,)can resonate with present day audiences. I do like that the story line calls attention and awareness to AIDS. And that people with AIDS are people, not statistics. It's not glamorous subject matter, but the 90's call to make people aware of AIDS saved thousands of lives. Starting with Magic Johnson's announcement of his condition, people became aware of the fact that anyone can get AIDS if they put themselves in a dangerous situation. Angel's death was very emotional and I felt for Tom's character when his partner died. Probably an all to familiar scenario for people who live together with AIDS.So the awareness to AIDS theme I respected. The be a lazy jackass and refuse to work part was kind of irritating. That protest scene was laughable. I was like what the F kind of protest is that? At a protest you should mention the actual subject you are protesting, call attention to it, and voice your opinions. And really all they were protesting was that Taye Diggs character was a ""sell-out"" who just wanted them to pay their rent. But musically I was VERY impressed. I grew up listening to the sound track. I had friends who had seen the musical so I knew some of the songs. It was cool to see them being played out. All in all I was disappointed with the story line, but enjoyed most of the characters, the emotional appeal, the awareness to AIDS, and the song and dance. And it did make me feel a bit of nostalgia.",Rent

I didn't really care for the characters much, they didn't seem to have any depth to them whatsoever. Maybe I didn't like it that much because I couldn't hear what they were saying (or singing) because my dumb friends were talking all the way through it. But I knew it was much better than I thought it was, so I decided to give it a second chance. I rented it and watched it again. I heard a lot of things that I hadn't caught before and understood most of everything they said and did. The third time I watched it, I absolutely loved, loved, LOVED it. I finally had a full understanding of Roger's character. I just got it, every little detail, I got it. During ""Without You"" I even cried a little. Before then I listened to the entire song ""Goodbye Love."" They didn't use the whole thing in the movie, but I think they should have. It adds a lot of depth to Roger and Mark's characters. If you didn't really like it, I suggest you watch it at least three times and listen to ""Goodbye Love"" in its entirety.

It is not as good as the stage musical. However, this adaptation is a noble try, thanks to the great direction of Chris Columbus, and it is probably the best they could do within the limitations of mainstream media and a PG-13 rating. Many of the songs are either turned into dialog or deleted altogether, and the ending is not as touching as the stage ending. I would recommend watching the deleted ending instead, it is much better. Other than great songs like ""Christmas Bells"" and ""You Okay Honey"" taken out, my main issue is that the mood is totally different. The musical, for the most part, is more lighthearted (well, as much as you can while dealing with AIDS) and there are jokes and biting satire. However, this is lost with the movie, which trips over itself while trying to be serious. When a dry-humored joke comes in, it takes you a while to even realize that it is a joke because of the sad tone. But with the faults in mind, this is still a good movie, with a great message of love and friendship in good and bad times.",Rent

I love the stage version (saw it twice), but film is an entirely different medium.The film, in my opinion, simply attempts to put the stage version ""on location."" Another poster made mention of the film version of CHICAGO, which I felt succeeded as a film because it was completely re-imagined for the screen.There were some engaging moments, such as when Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp) is briefly unconscious and dream/hallucinates the Tango: Maureen number. But most of the time, the explosion of dance and song seem incongruous in the gritty, East Village setting, and for all its heart, the film seems to lack imagination (when Angel sings Today 4 U, why do we only have to hear about his adventures? This is film, you can SHOW us what happened while he's singing, instead of having him simply jump around the apartment).I think the opening sequence betrays the problems of this film: The cast sings Seasons of Love to an empty theater. Why? An homage or tribute to Larson's original show? Rather than being freed by Larson's boundless imagination, this film adaptation seems handcuffed by the stage version, and, unfortunately, I believe the metaphor of a song being sung to an empty theater will prove all too prescient for multiplexes around the country.",Rent

I must admit that I was extremely skeptical about the entire project, and that I'm not a ""rent-head"", and this wasn't one of the movies on my wish list to see, but it satisfied me plenty. First off, lets talk story: most know the story, the one of eight East Villagers struggling with everyday life, with a few extremes. Just problems like money issues, drug addiction, and AIDS! A story that could easily be drove full speed into cliché heaven, but doesn't. It makes you feel the ups and downs of these characters. And how they convey all this not only through dialogue, but through song as well. Which brings me to my next point: the music. Being a theater major, I have heard the original cast album quite a few times, and not that it was bad, its just the movie music has this ""pop"" to it that vibrates your eardrums and your heart in the best ways. And like I said, no disrespect to the original. My final point centers around what many are saying will destroy any chances of this movie entering the Oscar race: the direction. Well, sorry to disappoint the Columbus skeptics out there who think he should stick to ""Home Alone's"" and ""Harry Potter's"", but he captured exactly what this movie was about. The grittiness, the hardships, life, love, NEW YORK! He gives the movie realistic credibility, which is always hard to accomplish with musicals (i.e. - people breaking into song and dance on the subway). These people sing, and it makes you think no differently of life. And to touch up on one more thing, the acting, what can you say? This cast overcame unbelievable obstacles to make this work, and they did just that. Anthony Rapp does an amazing job in leading this cast. ""La Vie Boheme"" hasn't left my mind since I left the theater. Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson are such a couple to watch. Such chemistry between the two. Their developing relationship throughout the movie makes you laugh, cry, and, well, cry a little more. Another scream of a relationship was Idina Menzel and Tracie Thoms as Joanne and Maureen. Talk about an unlikely couple! Somehow, though, they make it work oh so well. Taye Diggs is gold, as usual, as the roommate turned landlord to Mark and Roger. The two that really caught my eye, though. The performances that will go in my photographic movie character memory in a very special spot are Angel and Collins (aka Jesse L. Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia). Two guys I have yet to see on film (exception with Martin on ""Law and Order"") brought to the movie what this movie was about the most, and that is love. ""I'll Cover You"", sung by the duo, will melt your heart in a second.In conclusion, all I can say is just give this movie a chance. Don't just go off the negative buzz, because this truly is a beautiful movie. A movie that will have you appreciating your life more and more by the second. The movie that will take you on the emotional roller coaster of life. See the Holiday movie of the year.""No Day but Today""",Rent
245,MidnightPlus,"Soulless, a total ruined",3,10 April 2019,"Leave it to Hollywood to utterly obliterate the originality and humanity from its core narrative! Jonathan Larson's esteemed masterpiece ""Rent"" was a shocking breakthrough in the musical world! He not only manifested from real life of its concerns and controversy, the musical pushed to focus on the hardship, disorder, rebellion, and disorientation on a new emerging lifestyle! The broadway show itself is a phenomenon! BUT the big screen version is just a perfunctorily betrayal and violation from the very intention of the original adaptation!",Rent
246,dan_quiterio,Amazing!,9,25 November 2005,"I do consider myself to be a Rent head, as I have been a huge fan of the stage show since I saw it a couple of years ago (I know this doesn't compare to those who have seen it 30 times). I was looking forward to the movie version ever since I heard there was talk about making one. I've read about Spike Lee directing and even Justin Timberlake auditioning! With so much anticipation, I must say that I was not disappointed with the end result. It was obvious to me that much care and attention were made so as not to disgrace Jonathan Larson's legacy and I appreciate that. I also love the addition of new scenes in order to provide better context to some of the songs.Another commenter mentioned the flaws in the stage show. The stage is a verbal medium, whereas film is a visual medium. It is easier to show exposition in film than it is on stage, and I think that's to what he was referring. It makes sense that the film version would be more visually stimulating. The most blatant difference (as expected) is that the stage version is an opera, whereas the film version is not.I loved all performances but left the theatre wondering where they found Tracie Thoms. Wow! One qualm I had is the exclusion of the original song ""Love Heals"" from the end credits. It's a shame because I thought that song had Oscar potential written all over it.",Rent
247,scottessman,RENT is a must-see for all fans of the soundtrack and musical,9,21 November 2005,"RENTMovie Review by Scott EssmanDirected by Chris Columbus; Written by Stephen Chbosky based on the Broadway musical (book, music and lyrics by Jonathan Larson); Rosario Dawson as Mimi Marquez; Taye Diggs as Benjamin ""Benny"" Coffin III; Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Schunard; Jesse L. Martin as Thomas B. ""Tom"" Collins; Idina Menzel as Maureen Johnson; Adam Pascal as Roger Davis; Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen; Tracie Thoms as Joanne Jefferson. 135 Minutes. From Sony Pictures Entertainment.To any real ""RentHead,"" a film version of the nine-year-old musical Rent was a no-win proposition. The late Jonathan Larson's Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award- winning Broadway rock opera - based on Puccini's classic La Boheme - is an unqualified phenomenon, where die-hard fans have been waiting nightly in lines to try to win free tickets to the show. Naturally, a film version has been ruminated on for many years now.Telling the story of one year in the life of eight friends in the 1989-1990 era of the East Village in New York, Rent has become a classic in its own right - a tale of love, loss, and daily anguish among an eclectic backdrop of bohemian life.To add to the difficulty of bringing Larson's minimalist staging to the screen, director Chris Columbus lobbied for the project, winning the assignment despite his staunchly mainstream track record. Columbus previous directorial outings include Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, Bicentennial Man, and the first two Harry Potter films.However, despite the surface obstacles, what Columbus, screenwriter Stephen Chbosky, and the key cast have realized with the film version is likely to please all but the most picky audiences - RentHeads and general fans alike.In the first place, six of the eight original Broadway cast members have returned to reprise their roles. This piece of casting was quite astute on the part of Columbus and the producers, as the actors' necessary familiarity with their characters and songs help bring this film its requisite passion and intensity. Leads Adam Pascal and Anthony Rapp are the perfect roommates Roger and Mark, and nine years has not diminished their youthful appearances and affinity for their parts. Meanwhile, Taye Diggs, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Jesse L. Martin, and Idina Menzel all shine in their supporting roles.The two new key cast members - nascent movie star Rosario Dawson as Mimi and TV star Tracie Thoms as Joanne - both fit comfortably into the ensemble despite being new additions. Interestingly, Daphne Rubin-Vega, who was transfixing as Mimi in the original Broadway production - and nominated for a Tony Award for her performance - was not selected for the film. Ditto for Fredi Walker, the powerful singer who played Joanne on stage. But their replacements are more than adequate. Dawson may not have the husky sexy vocal talents of Rubin-Vega, but she brings a spectacular physicality to Mimi. Thoms sings melodically and is always believable as the tightly-wound Joanne. The film also features some fine cameos, the best of which is Sarah Silverman as the TV show Buzzline's sleazy executive Alexi Darling.In addition to hanging the movie on his wonderful cast, Columbus has opened up the show with carefully selected and dressed New York locations. The exteriors always speak honestly of George H.W. Bush-era New York, a time when urban decay had hit the East Village and true gentrification had yet to set in. Columbus' streets catch the vibe of New York and provide the film with its ninth key character.Notably, many changes have been made from the stage presentation, with varying degrees of success. Most significantly, Columbus' characters speak their dialog, as opposed to Larson's original group who sang nearly every word. For any fans of the show - in addition to the many fans of the original Broadway cast recording - this is a change that takes acclimation as one expects to hear the marvelously sung interactions between Mark and Roger, the many comical phone messages, and especially the final scenes with Mimi's return to Roger. Instead, all of this material has been transformed into Chbosky dialog, which works well enough and often mirrors Larson's words.Of course, Columbus has re-recorded all of the show's songs, and since the cast is _ the same as the original Broadway group, it's difficult not to compare them. Where some of the new numbers soar, including a mesmerizing opening rendition of ""Seasons of Love,"" other sections do not come off as strongly as the stage version. ""Over the Moon,"" Maureen's performance-art protest segment, is nicely staged, though Menzel's song on the soundtrack comes off more powerfully in several areas than the version in the film. ""La Vie Boheme"" is so lovingly executed in the film, it at least matches the album cut.Columbus and Chbosky have changed and rearranged other material from the show, but it's best left for individual Rent fans to judge these modifications on their own. Needless to say, the movie often has energy, conviction, and emotion which honors Larson's show while cinematically expanding the canvas of the musical in respectful ways.Certainly, many fanatical RentHeads will find fault with the film, but ultimately, Columbus' movie both pays homage to the show while chiseling its own sculpture of what Rent means in cinematic terms. With the source material and cast behind this version, any Rent fan and would-be future Rent fan is sure to delight in this tribute to love and life. Unexpectedly, Columbus and his team have done the musical and Larson proud.",Rent
248,Fatman7600,Amazing...very amazing,10,7 December 2005,"It was 2001 and my mom asked me what Broadway show I wanted to see for my birthday. Any show and she'll get two seats to it. Well I decided I wanted to see Rent. On this night the cast included Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia, Taye Diggs and Idina Menzel. I didn't understand the meaning behind that at the time, but I knew, hat I was seeing something special. I fell in love with the characters, related so well with Mark and almost immediately got the soundtrack.Then it was the summer of 2004 and I heard rumors that Rent was going to made for the big screen. As a huge Renthead I got scared and waiting for details. The more I heard about the original cast returning the most excited I got. Between then and the fall of 2005 I saw the Broadways show two more times to get ready. Then my fiancé and I picked up the movie soundtrack, and we were both blown away. From the opening note of Seasons of Love to the end of Finale B I knew it was going to be amazing. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms proved they can sing and mesh with the original cast very well.Suddenly it was November. My fiancé got two free passes to see Rent two night before the big premiere. We both went in and were ready for anything. What we got was the ride of a lifetime.I am not one to fully get emotionally involved in a movie of any kind but the minute Mark's video came up on the screen and the word ""December 24th 1989, 9pm Eastern Standard Time"" was stated after Seasons of Love, I was there. There the movie started.From beginning to end it was a roller coaster ride of emotions and amazing music. From the laughs and cheers during Rent and Today 4 U to the sexiness of Out Tonight to the romance in I'll Cover You right to the tearful funeral scene of Angel, it was incredible.Despite missing the second half of Goodbye Love and the simple but very effective Halloween, it was perfectly done. The theater I was in couldn't help but be at the end of their seats by the end of Roger screaming at Mimi during Another Day and when Collins proclaimed his lost love during I'll Cover You (Reprise).People and critics seem to be forgetting that this musical is a Tony and Pulizter prize winner, so they are forgetting about putting this movie in the Oscar race. This is by far the best picture of the year, Chris Columbus proved that he can be serious and brought the late great Jonathan Larson's work to life one more time.This movie proves that the tag line is absolutely true...No Day But Today",Rent

I have always had an issue with the fact that act I of the musical is supposed to happen in one evening. I don't think there is enough time to do all that is supposed to occur. By spreading the action over the week between Christmas and New Year's, it flows much better.At first, I had a laugh at hearing some of the sung lines spoken, but after the initial ""shock"" of that, the rest felt natural. It was great to be able to see most of the original cast in this movie. I don't think they looked ""too old."" Their performances were stellar.

251,jared5050,Beautiful,8,24 November 2005,"First off, I am a big fan of the show. Monday marked my 5th time seeing it. That being said, I was nervous about the movie. I love this show. Is Chris Columbus going to blow it? Don't get me wrong, I really do like Home Alone, but this is a different kind of movie. But he certainly did not ruin anything. The film was beautiful. It would be redundant to mention all the things I loved about it so I will mention the 2 things that I didn't really like but didn't at all effect my liking of the movie.a) ::spoiler I think::.... They never reconcile with Benny :( In the show he pays for the funeral (those of you know who's). In the movie the last we hear from him is that he can't find Mimi. I just felt the whole theme is to forgive and forget. They never do that with Benny. But whatever :-/ b)Don't get me wrong, I love the song ""Halloween,"" but with the flow of the film it seemed like it did fine without. Although I would still like it to be in the film, it's fine. But the end of ""Goodbye Love"" needs to be put back in. I'm sorry, Mark and Roger never really have a falling out. I just feel like them coming together again would be more moving had we seen that they fought in the first place.To mention things I did like...Roger going to the life support. Wow! enough said. ::Spoiler:: Angel's Death was insanely sad. The characters were played extremely well. Right of the bat when Mark gets on his bike and starts singing ""Rent"" I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. The film was envisioned in ways I would never have expected. Overall I don't know how it would be to a non-rent fan, or someone who doesn't know the show, but go and see it regardless. It's a movie that people should just see. It's a beautiful story now presented in a new, fresh and beautiful way. Enjoy.",Rent
252,brucks18,Good translation from the show,9,3 December 2005,"I saw rent off Broadway, the second it played. The intensity was infectious. Later, I saw it on Broadway, and the intensity was a little missing, though it was the same cast. The reason was simple: the off Broadway theatre seated about 220 people, and no matter what, you were 30 feet away. The Broadway theatre sat about 1,500 and the average person was 100 feet away. The movie brought the intensity back, since the movie could use close-ups to let us into their lives. Frankly, there is nothing like live theatre for a musical, but the movie actually may have told (an explained) the story better. The music is terrific no matter where you hear it. All in all, a very good movie (and for movie musicals, that's tough). One other thing, Jessee Martin is great in everything he does. And he's great here.",Rent

I am a huge RENT fan. Rarely, if ever, do I take the OBC recording out of my car. They did me proud. I was so pleased with the character development, and the transition from stage to screen. Jesse Martin's performance should rightfully earn him an Oscar nod. Ms Dawson really showed us her acting chops with her portrayal Mimi. On Mimi's part, I was truly satisfied on how they set up ""Take me Out Tonight"". I think the two best scenes were 1) the first Life Support meeting when the camera panned to all the faces and 2) the church when Tom reprises ""I'll Cover You"". All the rest were excellent as well.

I highly recommend getting to know the stage version of the musical first, because i know i appreciated the film that much more. A very clever move by the director was to have the songs that were cut 'spoken'. Although that may sound awkward and tacky, it sounded very natural. There were only a few insignificant things i could really think of that were awkward. There were lines sung that didn't make sense to what was happening on the screen, just to name one.

The film makes the audience want to know those people and some can relate to their pain and their situations, which are so real.i haven't seen the show, but I imagine that the film gets deeper into the characters than the play could.

Also, he cast many members of the original cast (a throwback to old movie musicals). These were brave and successful moves, and should finally knock down that door to MORE movie musicals.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Rent
257,jkluvschachi,"585, 600 Minutes Long...",1,26 November 2005,"""Rent"" opened on Broadway my freshman year of college. I am a part of the generation that claimed the piece as our own. Although in recent years I've scoffed at it for being passé, and wondering why people were still going to see it since it was so terribly dated.However, I was excited about the release of the movie. I was very disappointed. I wasn't sure if it would make a good movie in the first place, and watching it I became convinced it could, it just wasn't this movie. The casting is terrible. Granted, it's better to bring the original cast back than to use big names like Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, and the performances are solid. The actors are just too old. This is a generational piece. It's about people of a specific age group, and all of the actors were about twelve years too old.Columbus' direction was uninspired and unimaginative. Every number looked exactly the same. If people weren't singing and dancing on a table, they were singing and dancing up the street (usually holding hands). I understand the desire to capture the grittiness of the environment, but there's a way to do that with style, and in a way that doesn't look like a Bon Jovi music video. It was painfully obvious that Columbus didn't trust the piece to be the piece. Cutting the music from the recitative but having the actors speak the lyrics was a terrible mistake. It made the screenplay sound like it was written by Dr. Seuss. The first act ran way too long, the second act was eviscerated because the first half of the movie was so dreadfully paced, and I wanted to leave the film the whole time. I hate to say it, but don't see it.",Rent
258,zimmedc,Made Me Love Musicals Again,8,6 December 2005,"Not following the Broadway scene too much lately (I was a fan in my '60s youth), I wasn't really aware of what a sensation ""Rent"" was during its run there. I became more aware of it recently when it was satirized in the Southpark picture ""Team America"" and after my church intergenerational choir sang the show's ""theme"" song ""Seasons of Love"". Then one of the kids that I'm working with in a local musical said Rent was one of his favorites, so I was a first-weekend attendee at the movie.The story is important as it depicts gays, lesbians, drag queens and drug addicts as real people struggling with life, love, (and AIDS) just like so-called ""normal"" people. Being in the rock style, the songs aren't necessarily ""toe-tappers"" that you end up whistling on the way out of the theatre (though ""Seasons of Love"" comes close, particularly if you've sang it at least two dozen times, and ""La Vie Boheme"" is a showstopper--the plot is loosely based on the opera La Boheme), but overall the music is very exciting and integral to the story. The cast moved almost en masse from Broadway to Hollywood--Wilson Heredia, a Tony winner as drag queen Angel, might contend for an Oscar as Supporting Actor. I've read that there was some concern about mainstream Hollywood director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Harry Potter I and II) getting the job, but I don't see that the picture suffered for it--maybe some unconvincing special effects are the worst of it. As a rock opera, it takes some time to get used to having almost all the dialogue sung rather than spoken. Overall another solid B+ film--definitely recommended to fans of modern musicals, to those in marginalized communities, and to those with art in their souls.The soundtrack CD is great too--my favorites after many times through in the car are ""One Song Glory"" by Roger (his highlight of the film) and Roger and Mimi's duet ""Light The Candle"", as clever a dialogue song as I can remember. ""Tango: Maureen"" featuring Mark and Joanne is also great--both on screen and CD. ""Today 4 U"" by Angel is a tour-de-force, despite the oft-mentioned gaffe of mentioning Thelma and Louise before it was released. ""I'll Cover You"" is probably the most touching song. Collins has a beautiful baritone voice.",Rent

As with so many of these sorts of films the trailers tend to hide the offenses to trick the public into thinking they will be seeing one film and then shocking the audience with something completely different. Instead of a smart and boisterously youthful coming of age musical set against the backdrop of NYC during Christmas, the reality is a depressing, tortured, amoral, sacrilegious, dismal, dark (both figuratively and literally) film. When I saw the name Chris Columbus on the trailer, I had an expectation. In this instance, it amounted to nothing more than a false hope.If the centerpiece of a story is to try and normalize or garner sympathy for homosexuality and illegal drug abuse and those who chose to put their money and name behind such projects and apparently see it in a positive light - why do they hide it over and over again in the trailers?

260,HomeroB,A mishmash of meandering plot lines.,3,11 December 2005,"I'm never sure how to view film adaptations of plays, books, television shows, etc. Does one view it as a film? As an adaptation of the play to film? How faithful the transition is from stage to film? I have not seen the play performed in any capacity so perhaps that is a blessing and a curse. A cures because I have nothing to compare the movie to. A blessing because if the play is in anyway similar to the movie, I will stay as far away from it as possible.The film focuses on a group of faux-Bohemians living in the Alphabet City region of New York City, in a large, run down loft, refusing to pay the rent. The owner of the buildings want to tear them down and build a 'virtual reality loft', or something to that extent. What that is exactly is never really explained.Perhaps it is my experience in property management that has biased me, but for me, it was easy to see why the owner wished to do so. The buildings are hemmoreging money, tenets are refusing to pay, the places are is so much disrepair, that it would be ludicrous to attempt to do so. Eviction, sadly, is a truth of the world, and more often than not, ample time (at least in California) is given to tenants.Perhaps the film suffers too much from the boring hand of Chris Columbus. Several plot lines are weaved through, none of which are given any time to really come to fruitarian. Are we to focus on Mimis and Rogers budding relationship? The AIDS infected lovers? The biracial lesbian lovers with the rocky relationship? The aspiring film maker there to show the true New York? We never know. I assume that we are to feel to most of Angels death, but his time on screen is so short, his funeral comes off as flat and unnecessary.Oddly enough, the best scene in the movie, for me at least, was the scene that seemed to run completely counter to the films theme. While filming a homeless women being moved by police, Mark says to the officers ""Smile for Ted Kopple, officers"". It is not the police that push him away, but the homeless women. ""I don't need your help, artist"" she says. ""This city if full of artist. You want to help me? You got a dollar?"" Sullen, and looking away, she continues on, ""Yeah, I thought so"". In a film that tries to romanticizes poverty and demise in a region of the city that is the American Calcutta, that scene cuts sharply.Save your money.

First of all, the show itself is not terribly brilliant. In fact, the music is quite monotonous and painfully tacky. They all sound the same! The story is pretty melodramatic (not to make light of the aids epidemic) and very unoriginal. (I do however give props to the writer of the original play for tackling something that may, even by todays standards, be considered taboo. But that doesn't change the fact that this movie sucks.Chris Colombus, although having impressed me with his work on the first Harry Potter films has just tossed any respect that I had for him right out the window. You might as well go see the terrible play live, rather than having to deal with the terrible story, music AND compositions of Chris Colombus! Colombus really doesn't tackle the fact that this is a film and he is inherently given the freedom to move the camera (and the audiences point of view) wherever he wants. All of the choreography and camera work is designed in the same way that a person would choreograph a stage version of the show. It lacks depth and dimension as a result.My most important point is that when a director creates a musical film, it should be more than just a MUSICAL THAT IS FILMED. He should be interested in the fact that it is it's own work of art placed on a different, more culturally effective medium for the purposes of more than just alternate forms of distribution and exhibition.

I recommend this film to everyone who value friendship and commitment. Seeing this film is definitely time well spent!",Rent
266,mogordon-1,I loved it!,10,23 November 2005,"I have seen the play three times and was anxious for this movie to come out. My ""rent-head"" buddies were a bit skeptical, because of how other plays have been butchered when they were made into a film, but it was fabulous! The singing was fantastic. There were some scenes not in the play, but duh! It brought a lot of the scenes from the play together. It made me appreciate the play for all it could do on a stage, but it made this the New York of RENT. The singing was fantastic. It made me want to get up out of my seat and sing along. Rosario Dawson was a perfect Mimi. She just grabbed that role and made it her. Totally fantastic. I would see it again,and again.",Rent
267,cmarston,I See a White Light... Now Would be a Good Time to Stop Doing Heroine,6,24 November 2005,"Alright I have a confession to make before I can, with good conscience, proceed with this review: I don't like this show and I never have. I don't think it's really necessary to elaborate on that yet as details of those feelings will inevitably come out during this review. My point here though is not to attack the show, but to give an honest and intelligent view of the film adaptation. I'll be honest. As far as intelligent goes: I promise nothing.First off, I was impressed that they managed to secure nearly the entire Broadway cast for this. It was apparent from on screen interactions and the depth of the various performances that these actors and actresses are comfortable with these characters and with each other. This isn't something that is easy to come by. Take the recent adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera. Unfortunately they managed to get very few people who had performed in the stage show and that came through on screen. A bigger problem is that, out of the countless number of people who they could have gotten to do that movie, they ended up casting a Phantom who had never sung professionally and a Christine who couldn't sing the high notes, but that's not really the point I guess. My point is that it's always better when adapting a stage show for film that you get actors who are both capable of doing the performances and comfortable with the parts. It's a testament to these actors that I enjoyed their portrayals even if I continue to strongly dislike most of the characters.The renditions of the songs were, for the most part, effectively done. There were times where they got over the top. ""Tango: Maureen"" comes to mind. Was it really necessary to have a ballroom dance scene there? I understand why they did it, but still. I also have to take a moment and rip on ""Light My Candle"" because it's just such a stupid song. It's not that it's ineffective or that the intent isn't plot important, I just hate the lyrics. Maybe Jonathon Larson should have spent more time looking for his song. In contrast to the failing moments of the film, Angel's funeral was moving and honest, standing out as one of the few emotional scenes that didn't come off as hackneyed. ""La Vie Boheme"" was the highlight of the show for me, as it's always been. There are few things more bad ass than breaking out in song in the middle of a restaurant and singing about S&M just makes it that much better.I think it's important here to stop for a moment and discuss the one character in this show that I actually like: Mark. The thing that drives me crazy about this show is that all of the characters are, at times, almost cartoonish; this isn't helped by having stage actors play the parts. Mark stands out in this show because he has some subtly to his character. He's the underdog, the loyal friend. Despite wanting to be a starving artist he does what is necessary to save himself and his friends while keeping his pride. There are nuances in Mark that don't seem to be apparent in the others. Maybe it's because the other characters are strongly defined by their relationships and Mark is, romantically, alone. Whatever the reason I am glad that I have something to try and analyze when I watch this.Interesting fact for all you trivia buffs: I don't know who else noticed by the screenwriter for this adaptation was none other than Stephen Chbosky of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" fame. I guess he's matured with the times and gone from teenaged disillusionment to 20-something disillusionment. Good for him! Now onto my issues with the show in general: my main issue with this show is that they try and tackle too many issues all at once. Although they are all intertwined, heroine addiction, poverty, defiance, AIDS, coming of age, and the many other topics and themes of RENT could all be shows of their own and by throwing them all in together the scope of the show gets a bit too wide and all of the parts become too caricaturish to be believable. I have, however, always been impressed with how they handle homosexual relationships in this show. Rather than treating them as taboo the show portrays them as perfectly normal; an attitude that was not prevalent in the early 90s during the height of the AIDS scare. Even by today's standards this show is progressive. It's sad to think that in over a decade we haven't come any closer to achieving this level of acceptance and understanding. Unfortunately the only things in this show that are outdated are lyrics discussing ""dying in America at the end of the millennium"" and Mark Cohen's periodic announcement of the date. Other than that everything in this show remains relevant. Perhaps Larson was trying to incorporate as many themes are he could because he felt that others weren't willing to deal with these issues. I wish his plans had produced a less annoying show, but I guess his intentions were good.It's a good adaptation in that, from what I saw, the way people felt about the stage show was the same way they felt about the movie. A little advice: grab the tissues for this one ladies, but leave your boyfriends at home.",Rent
268,bohemian-in-a-tutu,"A celebration of love, art and ""La Vie Boheme""",10,20 December 2005,"I'm the first to admit I'm a hardcore Rent junkie; I know all the words to the original cast recording and a lot of the dialogue that's not on the CD, I can tell you what all the original stars have done since then, and I'm always big on introducing it to other people. I went into the movie hoping for the best (since there were 6 of the 8 original stars, and Stephen Chbosky did the screenplay) and expecting the worse (Chris Columbus directing? Rosario Dawson as Mimi?) Thankfully, what I was hoping for is what I got.From the opening chords of ""Seasons of Love"" I was getting sort of tingly. My chest got a little tight, like it was too full of excitement. It remained this way most of the movie, and that's a very good thing.I appreciated the April flashback, though I missed the image of her having ""left a note saying 'We've got AIDS' before slitting her wrists in the bathroom."" Adam Pascal and his sexy brooding angst didn't disappoint, and I found myself smiling through most of ""Light My Candle"" as he and Rosario Dawson (who was MUCH better than I expected) bantered. The other sides of their relationship (""I Should Tell You,"" ""Without You"") were quite good as well. And Dawson really danced up a storm in the Cat Scratch; certainly a lure for hesitant boyfriends who are dragged along.Jesse L. Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia really are the emotional heart of the film, delivering fantastic performances together and apart. I defy anyone not to be touched by their relationship, the way they exhibit such an undying devotion for each other and an enthusiasm for life that makes you want to follow their example and skip through the streets, celebrating the small beauties in life.Now, my favorite characters have always been Maureen and Mark and Joanne, and I was excited to see Idina Menzel (who I'd only ever heard on recordings before, but adore) and Anthony Rapp (who I'd seen in the touring company of Little Shop of Horrors, and adore) and newcomer Tracie Thoms portray that little love triangle. The ""Tango: Maureen"" was one of the best moments of the film, priceless, full of excellent banter, hilarious, and the fantasy sequence was awesome. Similarly, ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was brilliant, a battle of wills and sex-appeal (Thoms the wills, Menzel the sex-appeal).And, of course, I adored ""Over the Moon."" One of my favorite songs (I've performed it myself once or twice for friends), I was excited to see how it translated. It was one of the most delightfully absurd things I've seen all year.And... ""La Vie Boheme."" Fantastic. Full of energy and life and enthusiasm. The ""Hey mister... she's my sister"" - ""Sisters?"" ""We're close"" part made me smile so much, and I loved Rapp's leading of the song. Just spectacular.""I'll Cover You - Reprise"" and ""Goodbye Love"" (though I missed the second half) just twisted my heart around but hard.My only complaints are the few seconds of slow-motion sex-dancing during ""Without You"" and Roger's little rock-formation Santa Fe-fest. But those lasted about a minute, total, and the rest of the movie was splendid. It's a movie so full of emotion that it draws you in, you feel like you're right there with them. I got the feeling watching the stage show, and in some places in the movie, it was even stronger.Fantastic. Fantastic. Fantastic.",Rent
269,jlwb,"Dated? I think not, my friends...",9,23 November 2005,"So I'm reading the reviews...none seem too terrible, most are lukewarm, and some are even good. But one theme seems to override them: the material is ""dated."" Figures that journalists, whose livelihoods depend on presenting news flashes that will easily fall into the shadows after something more captivating happens, would find this material dated. You really think the topic of people living with -- not dying from -- AIDS is dated? Wake-up, friends...I'm not one to throw around statistics, but even I can tell you that AIDS is a much bigger problem today than when Jonathan Larson -- a genius in his own right -- wrote this almost 20 years ago. And drug addiction? Yeah let's not even guess how much that statistic has surged.True, the material is not as shocking as it was when it first graced the stages of NYC 10 years ago. But -- though I never knew the man -- I have a feeling Mr. Larson was not going for shock value. I am sure he realized in his day that his masterpiece would create quite a stir, but I highly doubt that was his purpose. What was it, then? If you ask me, it is obvious ...the human condition.The elements of humanity that satiate the stage version are virtually all apparent in the film version. These characters are vastly different from each other on the surface -- but listen to their songs. They are all experiencing life. And not only that, for the most part they aren't afraid to experience life -- the devastations, the love, the convictions, the laughter, the tears. Just listen to Seasons of Love -- it's all in there. That song, to me, is the premise of Mr. Larson's story -- this is life. It isn't necessarily glamorous, it isn't always glorious, but this is what happens in a year of these peoples' lives. And the one thing that gets them through it is the fact that they have each other -- their love for one another overshadows all of the intricacies of day-to-day life. And that theme, to me, is never dated, especially when it is portrayed so well, as Chris Columbus and the incredible cast have managed to do.I applaud everyone who had any part in this film -- aside from the excellent adaption of Jonathan Larson's exquisite piece of art, I think it is extremely important to constantly expose our society to controversial topics, about which most of us don't like to think. And I think the ones that are dubbed ""dated"" are the most important, because it means that those are probably the ones we have forgotten. But just because it seems ""dated"" does not mean it has gone away.",Rent
270,rockthexarts,An Amazing Movie With a Beautiful Message...If You Really Listen,9,18 July 2006,"Before seeing RENT, I had not seen the play or knew any songs besides ""Seasons of Love,"" which I loved. I came out of the theater loving what I saw and with just about every song stuck in my head, although I knew none of the words. Yes, some people might not be used to the whole gay relationship thing for two of the couples, but if you have a problem with it, get past that and enjoy the work of cinematic brilliance that is in front of you. RENT has many aspects to it, as it follows the lives of eight people, same and different in their own ways. First, the easy part: the music.The music of RENT can be described in one word: incredible. There is such a variety of genres in the music. Gospel/soul, rock, show tunes, rhythmic (if that makes sense), pop (in a good, very pretty way). The harmonies are outstanding and the songs leave you singing in your head for days and longing for the soundtrack. RENT has gritty and serious material, but you learn from their mistakes as well as their accomplishments and beliefs. The eight bohemians struggle and deal with poverty, drug addiction, love, life, and AIDS. At first, you might think that they should all just get off their butts and do something with their lives, and that they could have prevented certain things that happen to them, which is true (the part about how they could have prevented things). But really, they are trying to do something with their lives; that's the whole point of the movie. And as they deal with the mistakes in their pasts and what's in for them in the future, they realize they need to live life to it's fullest, no matter what, love, and be there for each other. A touching , riveting, and at times sad movie, RENT is something that leaves you thinking, feeling, and humming ( :) )! Don't be too cold hearted; listen to what it has to say. 9/10",Rent
271,samo314159,Past Due,2,26 April 2006,"If you ever see the film ""Hedwig And the Angry Inch"" you'll see ""Rent"" being made the butt of some of their jokes. Not the original ""Rent"", but the phenomenon of Rent's success. Precisely because it became popular in the context of Broadway ""Rent""'s dissemination became its downfall. Everyone wants to see ""Rent"" and so many different cast members and directors are needed to span the number of tours and the long run the show's enjoyed. Which works fine for other shows, but it seems to just throw a monkey wrench into Rent. But maybe the problem isn't that you can't take ""Rent"" out of the village so much as taking the village out of ""Rent"" just guts the show. Can you imagine a successful band like, say, the Rolling Stones, hiring a dozen cover bands to tour the country and play their hits? Who would go see them? Well, a lot of people would, but who among them wouldn't be bitterly disappointed? Rent is a cult of personality. We always hear that Roger's voice wasn't rough enough or that Angel didn't know how to play the drums right or Maureen wasn't appropriately sex-crazed. Would we have such strict standards if we were watching ""Sweeney Todd"" or ""The Tempest""? We'd understand without a second thought that there are a thousand ways to play a character and that one production of a play should actually try to distinguish itself from other productions of the same play. But we see these new actors and we react as if they'd replaced the cast of ""Friends"" with a group of unknowns who have no right to the roles they've usurped. So are the die-hard fans really so shallow that they want to see the exact same show over and over again? Maybe not. I'm beginning to think that the crowds clamoring to see ""Rent"" for the second, third, and fourth time are subconsciously expecting new songs and new plot twists. They can't get enough, but there's only so much to be gotten. They want to see growth but a play, by its very nature, is a static thing. ""Rent"" flies on the wings of a rock band but a rock band that composes one album and then tours the same tired songs for fifteen years without writing anything new is going to start becoming stale. Just look at Guns 'n Roses. The adjunct tragedy of Jonathan Larson's death is that ""Rent"" should have been a breakthrough piece and is instead of the body of his work. And yes, I do know ""Rent"" is not the only musical or play that Larson had written, but there hasn't been a Dan Brown-style retroactive canonization of his earlier works (who'd have thought ""Angels and Demons"" would have gone on the bestseller list four years after it was published?) and so my point still stands. To my mind, the film adaptation of ""Rent"" seems to be another desperate attempt something new from one single play. If you want to honor the legacy of Jonathan Larson, take a gander at new cutting-edge fringe musicals. Go hear the band that's playing for tips and beer. Sit down and write a play about your own friends. But in the name of God, stop subsidizing this machine that puts on the same show over and over and over again.",Rent

I have to pay my mortgage. I'm not especially happy about it, but I still do it.However, the music and dance was the best I have ever seen, on film or stage. I thought the standouts were Collins, Joanne, Mimi and, especially, Angel.I do think at the screening that I attended, the movie was pleasing to most. This was the first movie I have been to in a long time that no one got up to go the bathroom or concession stand, fidgeted or talked. I think everyone, including myself, was very entertained.

274,striver,Thank you!,8,23 November 2005,"I don't see how there could have been a better transition from stage to film. First of all, the fact that most of the original performers are in the film version made a huge difference. These are the people we have grown to love from the stage and original cast recording. This was the absolute best idea.Personally, I think I still like the stage version better, maybe because there seemed to be more raw energy, but then again... how much of that constant stage energy can really be caught on film? Part of the energy comes from the audience applause and 'participation' in the stage version. It felt kind of empty when an emotional song ended, and there was no applause (well maybe a little, but not like when experiencing it live on stage).Definitely some of the intricate plot subtleties were explained very well in the movie (unlike the stage version, where knowing the plot ahead of time helped a little). Many of the scenes were very very powerful. However, a few fell flat, and didn't have the emotion I was used to from before -- but again, that is not a fault of the actors or director, but just the nature of bringing an opera to film. Actually now it is not an opera, since many of the lines sung in the score are now spoken on film. Not a bad thing -- it just caught me off guard at first. Now it is more of a musical than an opera.Also very pleased to see that the audience (almost full-house, in suburbia no less!) reacted positively to the diversity of the relationships.In summary, I'd give the stage version a 10, and the movie version an 8, but the adaptation and performances of the actors as being a 10+++!

275,OZgRL215,Rent in theatre amazing. Rent the Movie...lacking,4,24 March 2009,"I saw this movie four times in theaters. The first was the midnight showing at the Ziegfeld in NYC. I don't remember that night but at the point the movie was actually pretty amazing.After sitting back and viewing it a few more times I found this to be a pretty mediocre film. I read earlier scripts of both Stephen Chobsky and Chris Columbus for this movie and they were absolutely amazing and well done and true to the nature of the story. Sadly most of it was scrapped for the PG13 rating and what we were left with was this thing.Of what I remember the earlier scripts had the Tango as very sexual with flashbacks of both relationships Maureen had with Mark and Joanne. It did have the whole fantasy sequence that was kept. April's suicide. a poignant moment before Glory or even to be incorporated into the song. gone.While I love the Original Broadway Cast they are not the be all end all of Rent. There honestly are so many better Marks and Maureens than Idina and Anthony. Rosario Dawson's Mimi is one reason why I now have to see this movie drunk and completely incoherent of my surroundings. She sounds like a drowning cat. Rosario and Adam had little to no chemistry. God Adam and Tamyra Grey had more chemistry than that. Hell even the Mimi he's on tour with now has more chemistry.Adam Pascal's Roger and Jesse Martin's Collins was my number one exciting reason for even acknowledging that there was a movie coming out in 2005. The two of them were absolutely brilliant. I could gush. but I'd rather not.Goodbye Love in its final cut ruined the movie. Skipping the whole sequence of Roger and Mark's argument and Mimi's bit was just leaving a gaping plot hole before What You Own and the whole end of the movie. and honestly Adam singing in the cliffs was just ridiculous. it looked like a cheesy music video.The best way to see Rent is either on its current tour, bootleg audios/videos, or that ""Final Broadway Performance"" DVD since sadly the show no longer plays in New York City at the Nederlander as it closed in September 2008.This is the one show that belongs on the stage not on celluloid.",Rent

282,MattButts,"A New Lease For ""RENT""",10,27 November 2005,"RENT is a musical that truly speaks to me, as its three themes are a major part of my life. I am gay, I have AIDS, and I have been homeless and living on the street. Having seen the stage production three times, and hearing the pre-release buzz about what was being changed  not to mention the critics' scathing reviews  I was totally prepared to hate the movie version of ""RENT."" But I decided to give it a chance, and at least try to like it. Instead, I loved it.Moving the opening number of Act II to the beginning of the film as a backdrop for the opening credits worked well, and the reprisal of the song throughout the film helps tie the story together. Strong performances from the original cast show that they are capable of transposing their talents from the stage to the screen, something not all actors can do.Director Chris Columbus kept his alterations to a minimum. Some lyrics are tweaked to fit minor changes in the storyline (in the stage show, Act I takes place in a single night, while the movie stretches it out over three or four days, requiring some subtle lyrical alterations). Songs that were converted to dialog scenes were appropriate, as their lyrics were more dialog-oriented anyway. It doesn't even register that once or twice someone speaks in rhyme.Yes, the story is a little dated, but this is after all the chronicle of another time. Columbus even admits this himself, with a shot of the New York skyline where the twin towers of the World Trade Center still stand. But he captures the angst and emotion of the times well. For instance, back then, AZT was the only drug available. Still, one historical goof makes it into the script: in her performance protest, Maureen makes a reference to a ""yellow rental truck packed with fertilizer and fuel oil,"" clearly a reference to the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building. Mark's opening narration establishes that it is December 1989, four and a half years before that event took place. But the anachronism is easily overlooked.Film gives the story freedom to play itself out against more visual backdrops than the stage version did, enhancing the production in many ways. One song from the stage show I never particularly cared for, ""Santa Fe,"" works very well as the ensemble sings it on a subway train, getting the passengers in on it. And Collins' reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" sung at Angel's funeral could produce tears from a block of stone.The critics be damned. ""RENT"" is a masterpiece.

It really is great, I've watched it probably a good 23 times already and I don't even own it! that's just from my one friend who has the movie, it just makes you want to get up and dance and sing along with it. It is also emotional but exciting and the actors were awesome! I can never get tired of seeing this movie over and over again. Each time I saw the trailer to this movie I wanted to see it more and more. After seeing it I was totally amazed, the trailer didn't show nearly as much as I thought it did. All I have to say is they did a great job on this movie and it is great!",Rent
286,dianeRR,A soul-less lip-syncing music video devoid of plot or character depth.,2,27 February 2006,"I'm really shocked. I expected to love this film after all I heard about the wonderful stage play. I had trouble sitting through the film and almost turned it off. It's a very talented cast stuck in a soul-less lip-syncing music video devoid of plot or character depth. They sing tragedy with inexplicable cheeriness. I never saw the play, but if it's anything like the movie, I don't feel I missed anything! I have a strange feeling A LOT got lost in translation. Hopefully the play defined the characters better. Perhaps the movie needed more exposition to define each character and why they were doing what they did (though this did get better in the second half). I had a hard time caring about the characters until near the end, and even then I never stopped being aware that I was watching actors acting. The plot, such as it was, felt chopped and contrived. The main theme song and several others were beautiful; the rest I felt impatient for them to end. As the movie finished, my first thought was ""I'm glad I never paid the $90 for a ticket to the play!""",Rent
287,demonelipso,I'm not a musical fan...,10,27 August 2006,"Now, trust me. I am NOT a musical fan. I've always seen them as corny, rather pointless, and... well, unenjoyable to sit through with characters randomly bursting into song and dance numbers on crowded streets. This is the one exception so far.I have not had the pleasure of seeing the stage production as of yet; I hope to eventually. The songs are why I got into it; the catchier tunes, such as La Vie Boheme, Seasons of Love, and I'll Cover You, I had seen used elsewhere, and thus my curiosity lead me to eventually rent RENT. And I don't regret it. It has since become one of my favorite films.It does not fear to tread where some would call taboo; the film takes AIDS, sexuality, death, and other such subjects head-on, while still managing to make the film memorable (And not in a ""I can't believe I watched that utter tripe"" way). The songs, while I still find the concept of 8 fully-grown people bursting into song in a resteraunt rather ludicrous (and yet very, very fun!), it manages to work. The film doesn't serve entirely as a vehicle for the songs; and yet, it doesn't stick to one long, solid plot- which isn't bad, in the case of RENT.It has cut out several songs from the Broadway production (as well as the majority of Goodbye Love), as I know; and yet, while it would be pleasant to have them in, the film doesn't suffer horribly.Yes, I know you'll all wonder ""how do the all know the words?"" or ""how did she just get up and sing like that?"". But it's a musical; in musicals, people know the words. Musicals obey different rules than typical films.Don't view it looking for anything else; enjoy it for what it is, instead of despising it because of what it's not.",Rent
288,coffeekitten13,Watch Rent! No day but today,10,9 November 2006,"I was completely, utterly, entirely blown away by Rent! The acting is perfect, and some of the songs are so moving that I cry whenever I hear them. My friends introduced me to it a year ago, and honestly I think I'm obsessed! You get so hooked by it, and every time you hear a song from it you're back where you started.Let me start off by saying: not everyone will understand this movie. I'm going to be daring and make a comparison. I think 50% of my peers at school would love this movie. The other 50% would say ""It can't be better than High School Musical!"" Please! That movie lacked substance and, frankly, the songs and acting sucked. I'd take Adam Pascal over Zac Efron any day.But for the other 50%...welcome! Rent is AMAZING! It's about a group of friends living under the shadow of the AIDS epidemic during the late 1980's. It's based on the opera La Boheme (from which it draws characters, settings, themes and even the wildly popular song ""La Vie Boheme"") It follows the lives of these seven amazing friends living in the rough world of New York City.Let's start with Mark Cohen, an amateur filmmaker. Mark has quit trying to write fiction, and has decided to document his own life instead. Mark's a fun character, as his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him for a lawyer named Joanne. But his story is ultimately uplifting and sweet, as he finishes his film and decides to take love over money.Mark's best friend and roommate, Roger Davis, is a struggling songwriter who's HIV Positive and coming off a year of rehab. He's desperate to find ""one song glory""...to write a song that will immortalize him. But after his girlfriend April commits suicide, he locks himself in a shell and becomes numb to love. It takes someone very special to change him.Enter Mimi Marquez, a dancer at a club. She's wild and wants to live in the moment, Roger's exact opposite in every way but one. She, too, is HIV Positive. Mimi teaches Roger how to love, but has to learn about herself in doing so.Roger and Mark's friend, Tom Collins, is a computer-whiz who has AIDS. He's known as Collins to his friends. When he returns to NYC on Christmas Eve, he gets beat up and mugged in an alleyway. Then, he's rescued by an ""angel."" Angel Dumact Shunnard is that angel! He's a drag queen with a huge heart, and Angel is truly the core of this group of friends. He and Collins fall in love, but Angel's life is put into jeopardy by AIDS. Angel's life ends during the movie, but somehow he/she remains the heart of the movie all the way through.Maureen Johnson, Mark's ex, is a flirty entertainer. She's wild and outrageous, and sometimes very self-centered, but she truly does mean well. She ends up with Joanne Jefferson, a stiff, droll lawyer who's sweet but wants commitment.The story line is brilliant because it brings these people together while still telling seven separate stories of seven different journeys. The soundtrack is just as beautiful, as is the live Broadway version.La Vie Boheme!",Rent

I mean who likes a movie where they all die in the end? I sure don't! The movie has no plot what so ever! It's just like weird. Who makes a movie with the most random topics: AIDS, drug use, paying the rent? There's no climax or plot or anything. It's just random singing on how much their lives suck. It's not my fault they have aids...cry me a river! Oh wait I forgot another random topic in this movie...Angel um yea he's or she OK IT is a drag queen what does that have to do with anything? Plus there shows ""gay/lezbian-ness"" too not that I have a problem with gay people it's just not right for this movie.

290,kagemagic,Personally...,10,5 February 2007,"Okay, personally? I thought it was an amazing movie. When transferring a Broadway into a movie, one has to be careful -- sure, you get a lot of cool effects and shots and you can redo a scene until it's absolutely perfect, but a lot of times, a movie focuses too much on that stuff and it loses the original FEEL of the musical.This movie didn't lose the feel. The idea of recasting most of the Original Cast? Pure genius. Rosario Dawson? Beautiful -- although some understandably dislike her casting because she doesn't really sound like a junkie, but nevertheless. Her voice is pretty, her moves are hot, and the chemistry between her and Adam Pascal is electrifying. Tracie Thoms? That woman can sing. I also always had this ""thing"" with the original Joanne, because she seemed loose... not a refined lawyer who was pulled into the Bohemian world. I think Tracie Thoms offers a good character :D So. Think about it. I know a lot of people say RENT is too angsty and whiny and unrealistic, but this show meant a WHOLE BUNCH to the cast. It was an emotional point in their life and most of them even came back TEN YEARS later, to do it all over again for a movie.I am a RENThead, no doubt about that. The music is enjoyable, the characters are fun, yet not overdone, and the plot just screams REALITY SUCKS, BUT THERE'S STILL HOPE -- and not in a ""the sun'll come out tomorrow"" way. It's all about screaming and crying and anger and depression and stubbornness. Now doesn't that sound familiar? I understand that a lot of people won't like this movie because of how different it is from the musical. True, a lot of songs were lost -- a lot of songs I love from the Broadway. But the songs featured in the movie are redone in a good, foot-thumping way, and I can listen to them endlessly.This movie wasn't made to please the masses. It was meant to honor Jonathon Larson and to provide his memory with the fulfillment of his dream. I get that some people just don't like RENT, but try to keep an open mind. This isn't some storyline some rich man wrote while trying to picture a Bohemian life. This is the story of a Bohemian himself who wanted to write a musical and who threw in his own life experiences. You don't have to enjoy it, but please be respectful.In all, RENT is a great movie; it has wonderful chemistry between the characters, amazing voices, interesting/fun songs, and moments where you just go, ""Man, that really sucks!"".It's memorable; it's RENT.",Rent
291,strangeman,"Great music, a solid story and strong characters combine to tell an urban tale of finding hope in the seemingly bleak.",10,4 December 2005,"To start, the music and performances are excellent. The songs are well written. Thoughtful melodies and lyrics are weaved inside an eclectic rock format. While I found Ms. Menzel to be the least physically attractive among a stunningly attractive cast ( she's pretty saucy none-the-less), her singing blew me out of my seat. Wow! Next, the story is very good and well structured. Poverty-stricken twenty-somethings (thirty-somethings?) struggle with external pitfalls of the world and the internal search for acceptance, meaning and love. The characters are very much individuals. But they combine to form a family, each playing a specific part of the whole. The story deals with drug addiction and homosexuality on a very human level. I dare say that the depicted acceptance of gay relationships foretells of a hopeful future where people of all orientations can live their lives w/o fear of persecution. The more conservative among us will find this aspect of the story very challenging.The setting is gritty and palpable. There is seamless movement between location and sets. It all feels like you are there. The shots from New Mexico are stunning in their own right and in contrast to the urban jungle.For me, musicals sacrifice some feeling of reality to allow for the musical aspect of the story. This movie does a most excellent job of keeping things real in a very musical setting.Oscars are forthcoming. If you liked Chicago, throw in an industrial sized dose of realism and you are ready for Rent! Most excellent!",Rent

This movie obviously gets a ten out of ten mainly because it has great songs and wonderful significance that tells the audience about the many difficulties mainly focusing on the issues in the cities of New York. This film is about a group of bohemians who struggle through many today issues including AIDS, deaths, etc. I personally loved this movie, but that just might be because I have a lot to relate with it. The only flaw that I saw in this movie is that it should of kept all of the songs in it such as Christmas Bells, Halloween, and Finale A. But besides that it was a great film giving strong morals such as ""No day, but today"" which means live today as your last and ""Light my candle"" which acts as a sign of guidance. So if you get a chance to see this go and see it. But when you see it don't looks at it's flaws and say ""oh ewe there is homos in this film"" because this film is so much more than that.",Rent

The acting was excellent as was the singing, dancing, and just about everything else as far as the performing aspect was concerned. It was also very well cast, and the sets were excellent. Kudos to all involved with the making of the movie. You did very well.The actual story/movie itself...now that's a different opinion. Basically a story about a bunch of drug addicted, deadbeat squatters in New York city. If you have seen Team America, Matt and Trey hit it right on the nose when they made fun of it...""Everybody has AIDS."" But despite all of the problems they have, all they are concerned with is paying the rent. It's very simple. It's called a job. GET ONE!!The show also has multiple points where there could be an ending...but alas...it's not over yet! Never mind how much soda you drank while watching the movie, and despite the fact that your body now wants the soda out of your system, it's not over yet. The show is 525,600 mins too long.The icing on the cake...the only interesting character the storyline has, they kill off.I am glad I never spent a tremendous amount of money to see the play, and that the $7.50 for the movie ticket was all I forked out for it.

But, wow...it was fantastic. I was in a packed theater yesterday, and being a Renthead myself, was just a little worried. Especially when I listened to the soundtrack and found that they were missing my favorite song, the Christmas one. They took out the ending of Benny's little plot line, where he gets kicked out by Allison, but it doesn't even matter. Chris Columbus did this movie better than any other movie I have ever seen based on a musical. It was fantastic. More than fantastic. Almost better than the musical. It is my new favorite movie. The acting was superb, they showed that they were true performers with this one-Jesse L. Martin was doing flips on a subway pole, and the story moved with fluidity and ease, the plot being seamless. It seems that Larson's superb musical has been cleaned up in parts that he didn't have a chance to, and the end is incredibly well done. You barely remember when they cut out a song, because there doesn't seem to be too many lines to begin with. And even if you're not a Renthead, or even a real fan, the story is incredible. More than half of the theater was crying when Angel died (another FANTASTIC performance!) The newcomers to the show fit in easily with the original cast members, and the original cast members performed as if they were just opening the show.

These expectations were 99.9% fulfilled. Chris Columbus made an excellent job of the transition from stage to film and though at first i was a little disappointed with the fact that certain songs were left out of the film version i soon forgave the decision. The chosen songs still portrayed the emotive situations with the strongest of emotions and the more up beat/ tense music helped to reinforce the seriousness of others Jesse L Martin and Wilson Jermaine Heredia were absolutely amazing. The way they interacted with each other and their body language portrayed perfectly the love between Angel and Collins and they appeared to be one entity as they were so wrapped up in their love for one another. I became so lost in their scenes together that it felt as tough i was really there observing a real life couple.I feel that Taye Diggs made an excellent Benny and all aspects of the characters persona were conveyed excellently by Tayes strong sense of presence. Of course all the other actors/actresses were excellent also but these characters were, in my opinion, the strongest in the film and they lived up to my expectations that i had from seeing the UK stage version many times.I now look forward to the release of the DVD so i can take home a visualisation of the amazing Script that is Rent.All in all i feel that Rent was worth the price of the cinema ticket and more,there is definitely ""No Day But Today"" for seeing this film.

Alas, I came away from the screening quite disappointed. The best part of the movie for me was the first five minutes when the incredibly talented cast stood on an empty theater stage and sang the heck out of ""Seasons of Love."" Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. All the grit and realism of the play was missing, replaced with splashy, phony looking sets and thread perfect costumes that these characters could never afford in real life. Yes, the cast was too old for the roles, but they make up for that with talent and enthusiasm. Still, the play is almost void of any genuine emotion. The dance numbers are way too conventional and choreographed. When all is said and done, it felt like a lame version of the movie FAME (I liked FAME a lot). But Rent is supposed to be the anti-establishment musical. There is NOTHING anti-establishment about it. Chris Columbus blew it.

However, when the drag queen started dancing around the apartment with drumsticks, it was over for me. But, I must admit that the guy from Law and Order was the best thing about the play, and the singing was very good. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing of value to this movie.

I saw it with the original cast, as well as with the many replacements that have come and gone through the years. I didn't think that the silver screen would do it justice, and I was pleasantly surprised. I acquired tix to the prescreening in my hometown, and was joined by an artsy crowd of theater majors, theater fanatics, first timers and the reviewing press. From opening note to final credits, the movie rocked the house. The crowd joined in on several occasions, from singing the beloved 'Seasons of Love' to mooing at Maureen's command. The movie version stays true to the feel of live theater, as the sets, though largely shot on location, maintain the lighting and staging that you would see in a Broadway production. There are certain elements that are more effective on screen, as bigger budgets, special effects wizardry and multiple takes allow for ""perfection"", but even still, the production didn't feel overdone. I was thrilled to see many of the Broadway cast in the movie, and was equally pleased at the performance of Rosario Dawson.

I was worried they wouldn't capture the heart and soul of the play...and they did. There are only a few things that could have been done differently or done better.The only two problems with the movie (I thought) were:Maureen's bare butt on screen (I don't really think that was necessary)They left out some really good songs and changed some lyrics to dialogue (They sounded like they were doing Shakespearian sonnets or something)That's all. Some people I went with took offense to the overly gay gestures in the film but personally, I thought it brought more humanness to the characters. I read the play and fell in love with the music long before the movie was even thought up.

307,KID_A25,A mixed bag.. but overall Great,8,22 November 2005,"Saw a sneak of it last night, and if you have seen the show live, prepare to be disappointed. Some of the most charming little things in the play have been taken out of the movie completely, or the lines are spoken instead of being sung. Most notably was the scene where Mark shows up to the life support meeting, and he says ""I'M MARK! well, this is quite an operation."" and the Tom Collins line ""I have rewired the ATM at the food emporium to provide and honorarium to anyone with the code."" Both of those segments are spoken in the movie, and I for one, was extremely disappointed. However, many of the musical numbers are done very very well. Some of the liberties taken were confusing to me (like why the switch to 1989?? instead of 1999?). Some words here and there are changed, for no apparent reason what-so-ever, but they do not detract too much from the experience. All in all the movie is solid... If you have seen the show live before, you will be disappointed for sure, but not to the extent where you will hate the movie. Some parts I would say ""man, they really messed that up."" and other times I would say, ""sweet, that was awesome!"" so it ends up being a mixed bag, but a very enjoyable one.",Rent

It was mediocre, at best. The camera seemed to always been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Instead of showing Idina Menzel (Maureen) delivering a hilarious line during ""Over the Moon,"" they would be showing the crowd's reaction to the hilarious line before that.The acting...was actually really good, I thought. The acting was good by the actors at least, except for Adam Pascal (Roger), who I was extremely disappointed with. He just had a blank face throughout the whole movie. Rosario Dawson (Mimi) definitely surprised me, however. I was very impressed with her performance. The rest of the actors did extremely well, given their crappy directing. I felt he (along with the screenplay writer) was taking away the actors' ability to connect with each other. By using voice-overs for the songs, by having Mark and Roger sing songs completely separate, took away the chance to let the audience seem them react to one another, show real emotions not just by themselves but with each other. There could have been so many more clashes. They needed to rely on more than just the music to bring about emotions.Music...obviously was fantastic. Everyone's voices blew me away, except for Rosario Dawson's, although she was not bad. The two with the greatest voices were no doubt Jesse L. Martin (Tom Collins) and Tracie Thoms (Joanne.) Many of the songs, especially ""I Should Tell You,"" could have had a smoother leeway into the song. I wasn't a big fan of the voice-overs for the songs. I felt they were once again taking away the actors' ability to connect with each other.The biggest thing that made this movie deserve a 6 out of 10, was that it didn't use SUBTLETY. That's what makes a truly great film. I definitely think the screenplay writer and the director completely underestimated their audience. Did we need to see ""HIV...POSITIVE"" on a sheet of paper to understand that April died from AIDS? Did we need to see a huge sign saying ""You are now entering...New Mexico"" to understand that he was heading for Santa Fe? They fed the audience with a spoon, and an filmmaker should never have to do that.As I said before though, it stayed very true to the show by Johnathon Larson. It kept almost all of the songs except the small songs that were in between scenes. It kept the feel of the original show: the humor, the despair, and the message. And that will keep the ""Rentheads"" happy, I believe.",Rent
311,Dare1025,A splendid rendition of the musical..It only took 10 years!!!,10,26 November 2005,"I really enjoyed the movie. The only part I really missed is Christmas Bells. Everything in the movie was just a good feeling, from the time they turn on the house lights to the last beautiful image of Angel waving good bye. This movie, it just gave a feeling that Phantom didn't. It gives me the inspiration to do better in life and not be so stressed because there is No Day But Today. The movie has its very powerful moments such as I'll Cover You Reprise (which managed to give me watery eyes) to Finale B at the closing of the film (which actually made me tear. It also made me full fledge break out in song because it just made me feel so happy. The not so strong points of the movie include What You Own and the end of Another Day. I plan to see the movie many a more time. I highly suggest it to anyone who gets easily inspired, is gritty, and enjoys musicals that have a strong moral rather than relying on an elaborate set or plot.",Rent
312,starrydreamr23-1,Very good screen adaptation of an emotional Broadway musical,9,23 November 2005,"From the opening scene, the movie RENT drew in the crowds - for the first 20 mins or so I had to keep telling myself that I was watching a movie and not the musical. Of course, this was difficult since after the first few songs the audience kept clapping. From the beginning to the end I was drawn to the way Chris Columbus was able to direct the cast (all of whom are original Broadway-ers, except for Rosario Dawson) around NYC and how the songs were able to be incorporated. The acting and singing were equally phenomenal. One thing I wish I could do would be to sit down with the cast and have them compare acting on Broadway as opposed to acting with a huge screen production like this one. For newcomer Rosario Dawson, she absolutely lit up the screen as the character Mimi and her singing was amazing...you would've thought she was in the original cast. It was really interesting to see Idina Menzel (Maureen) and Taye Diggs (Benny) interact with one another as on-screen foes as they are off-screen couple. Menzel had me cracking up during her solo performance - her facial expressions and outgoing antics had the audience rolling. Anthony Rapp (Mark) and Adam Pascal (Roger) still had that chemistry that they did on stage together. They played off of one another very well and you could feel the tight connection between the two. For anyone who wasn't able to see the original cast on Broadway, heres your chance. For anyone who hasn't seen the play, do it! For anyone who hasn't seen the movie, do it! And when you're doing either, bring tissues!!",Rent
313,pontepy,"Great Songs, Weak Book, Terrible Direction **SPOILERS",3,26 November 2005,"Having never seen the stage version of Rent and usually loving musicals, I looked forward to seeing it. However, at least on the basis of the film version, I was stunned that this musical ran longer than a week in NYC never mind for a decade. It has a wonderful score but its book/story is astonishingly trite and presents characters so skeletal that they are barely distinguishable from each other. The story becomes infuriatingly pretentious when it tries to introduce elements on AIDS and drug addiction. It almost glorifies them rather than deal with them in any insightful way. Since the project is obviously aimed at adolescents, this is a dangerous point of view to take.Writing: The score, especially the musical elements, are wonderful. I'm sure this is what has caused much of the show's popularity. Many of the songs are infectious with their rhythms. A good score can go a long way to helping a musical out. But the book is written inactively. Instead of allowing us to see the characters in action and to draw our own conclusions about them, something that is at the heart of all good drama, the characters ""told"" us what everyone was like. We are ""told"" that Angel was ""all about love"" but we never actually see Angel do anything to that effect. Jesse L. Martin was quite remarkable in conveying genuine love towards the Angel character and he transcends much of the badly written material. We are told of the great love Roger (Adam Pascal) and Mimi (Rosario Dawson) have. But we never see it. We see them clashing all the time but never see any real bonding or support. There doesn't even seem to be a strong chemistry between them, though both actors are quite attractive and quite good. Their consequent breakup and misery seems self-indulgent and selfish rather than sad. Mimi's relationship with Benny comes out of nowhere and seems dramatically manipulative rather than genuine or moving. The best written relationship is that between Maureen (Idina Menzel) and Joanne (Traci Thoms). We see Joanne actively try to change Maureen and Maureen's willful choice to flirt in spite of Joanne's wishes. However, it basically stays on one level with little complexity. The whole ending with Mimi & Roger is ridiculous. I don't know if it was like that in the stage version (I'm being vague in order not to spoil the ending) but it was groan producing. The heavy handed LA VIE BOHEME song, where the ""bohemians"" essentially verbally assault the wealthy men who want to gentrify the block, comes off as absurd and unjustified. Such powerful men would never sit still for two seconds and listen to such adolescent drivel and antics being aimed at them. I remember enjoying this number when I saw it on the Tony Awards the year Rent won. But it became tiresome here. The entire story also regularly had plot turns that were extremely ""convenient"" rather than coincidental.Casting: Most of the cast members are talented, attractive and wonderful performers. They do the best they can but unfortunately there is a major handicap: they are all way too old for their parts. While they play the moments and overall parts well, their age works against them in a crucial way. The story and characters are about young people who are stumbling on their way to adulthood. They make one idiotic decision after another. If you never forget that the characters are these young people (18-22 at the oldest), you can forgive their stupidity and idiotic choices as bad growing pains. In fact, the characters' actions seem more like 14-18 than 18-22. However, most of the cast read as if they are in their 30s. Consequently, their behavior and bad choices seem unforgivable. If you knew them in real life you would either stage an intervention or avoid them altogether. If you believe they are 18, you would believe they could be redeemed. At 35, you don't want them around the house.The material needs actors the age of the cast in the original The Breakfast Club. In fact, at times, RENT reminded me of a musical version of The Breakfast Club. However, with this particular cast, as talented as they are, it would be comparable to remaking The Breakfast Club today with Brad Pitt, Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock and a few other mid-30s or thereabout actors. Good as some of them might be as actors, there is no way in hell they can believably play teenagers. Again, you could excuse teenagers doing the things The Breakfast Club characters do if you believe they are young and think them dysfunctional if they do it at 35. Ditto Rent.Direction: With the exception of Only The Lonely, Columbus has had a tendency to eschew character development and active choices to always show his characters ""feeling emotions"" and telegraphing that to the audience. Columbus always wants to ""tell"" the audience what to feel. He always zooms in on a person crying. Or zooms in on a person smiling. But he never focuses the conflict of the scene or finds the right reaction shot. A subtler director, and one who knows how to deal with character, could have covered over some of the poorly written characterizations with the right reaction shot or a specific moment of character detail.Overall: Rent was mildly entertaining at the start and went on to simply become annoying by telling us at every turn what to feel. I didn't cry during it except from relief when it was over. It's a perfect example of what has killed film musicals. (And, for the record, I loved CHICAGO and wished that Rob Marshall had directed this.)",Rent
314,azmoviebuff,Go see this movie!,9,29 November 2005,"I have been an IMDb addict for years, since it's inception. This is the first time I have written a review. SO here goes... I am a Broadway fan, have seen Rent in NYC and anybody who loves Broadway Musicals in general needs to see this movie. It is faithful to the genius of Jonathan Larson's vision, it contains nearly all the Original Broadway Cast. It is simply amazing to see any Motion Picture that has one Tony Award Winning Voice in it, much less this one has two (and a host of nominated voices as well). I was singing to myself through the whole thing. TO anyone out there that is dissing this movie...I say how often can you get actual chemistry between actors, first rate quality talent, a movie that makes you laugh and cry, a great story, a great thought provoking message and beautiful visuals in a movie? Appreciate this movie and what Chris Columbus did if you like the genre. Yes, not everyone wants to see people walking down the street and breaking into song...this movie isn't for them. It was made for millions of others who do appreciate this type of film. It was well crafted and I will personally see it again and again, as well as buy it on DVD. Viva la vie Boheme! Kudos to the entire cast, you should be proud of this first rate achievement. If no nominations or awards follow...I would say you were robbed. Thanks for making this rent-head a happy one!",Rent

You don't really think about the concept or effects of AIDS but once you see this movie you begin to understand why it is discussed as so deadly. The musical emphasis of this movie was extraordinary and being a frequent singer myself, I loved the many singing occurrences it presented. The characters seemed so real as if you were actually in the movie. Mimi and her drug addictions were really saddening to the fact but, any teenager or even adult that uses or was going to use in the future that sees this movie I know will immediately stop because of what ""Rent"" demonstrates. I really did want to add a spoiler on here but, I know that if I read one before seeing this movie, I would be utterly repulsed. If anyone heard this was a bad movie, see it anyways because you'd most likely adore it, the plot, the characters and the soul of the film. I know that opinions differ but anyone who didn't like this movie, must be crazy. I love it so much! In other words, go out right now, and buy a ticket! You'll love it so much, that if you don't...

Adam Passcal is a fantastic actor, and Rosario Dawson is amazing as Mimi. Idina Menzel is funny as hell, a perfect Maureen. One of the best things about this is everyone in it can ACTUALLY SING WITHOUT MAKING YOUR EARS THROB! The only thing that I did not like about Rent was the cutting that they did at the end. It went by way to quickly. Half (more like 3/4) of Goodbye Love was cut out. I recommend this movie for anyone who just wants to sit down and listen to fantastic music. Chris Colombus made it almost exactly the same as the original Broadway musical.",Rent

However, it's great all the way around, with fantastic music which I've been singing in my head for 10 years, an endearing cast, and a comedic take on Maureen's performance piece (which I always thought was the weakest point of the stage show). I missed some things, some of the songs were cut, and I was sad about it. I thought that Angel's sweetness was understated some, and that we lost a little of the concept that Mark detached from his friends because he knew he would survive them all, that he hid behind his camera lens to hide his pain, but strong choices made in scenes like _La Vie Boheme,_ and especially _Take Me or Leave Me_ made me happy and want to sing along (though I didn't, much to the relief of the people sitting around me).

The ""loft"" that Roger lived in was far too elaborate than one would expect, and the whole movie is done in an elaborate ""July 4th"" celebration style.I really didn't like the moving around of several of the songs.

The camera angles are amazing and just seeing a play that you love come to live is just so breath taking. The movie includes all of its original songs, but it cuts out the ""Christmas Bells are ringing"", ""Halloween"". and half of ""Good-Bye Love"".

322,joemystery2003,Fine yet oddly unsatisfying,7,2 December 2005,"""Rent"" directed by Chris Columbus (""Home Alone,"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") was a film destined for mixed reception. There were complaints about the film version of the smash Broadway musical before it was even screened. Most of the original cast was brought back (with the exception of newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms) about twelve years older than their characters. Also, the choice of director Chris Columbus was also called into question. This movie was never going to be a runaway hit like its Broadway predecessor.Yet, it isn't a bad film. I myself have never seen ""Rent"" on Broadway and found the movie enjoyable. First, let me warn those who are in a similar boat as me (those going to see the movie who haven't seen the play.) It's a rock-opera. Meaning almost EVERYTHING is sung. Unlike films like ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge,"" only about 10 to 15 percent of the film's dialogue is spoken. This clearly unnerved other people who were sitting in the theater with me. That being said, ""Rent"" is not (I repeat) a bad movie. However, if you haven't seen the Broadway musical, you feel like you're being told a personal anecdote by a friend--they're really excited, but you weren't there, it didn't happen to you and you're pretty sure that they're adding their own spin on the story. It's hard to stay interested.There were several standout performances. Jesse L. Martin is amazing as Collins, as is Tracie Thoms as Joanne. When I saw the trailer, and I noticed that it didn't feature any clips of Rosario Dawson's singing, I took that as a surprise that I was in for a disappointment. Boy, was I wrong. Rosario Dawson lights up the screen from the moment she belts out the provocative and upbeat ""Out Tonight,"" to the last frame. Her singing and dancing is by far the most impressive in the movie and despite the film's lukewarm reception, I pray she receives a Golden Globe nomination (if Jamie Lee Curtis can get one for ""Freaky Friday,"" Dawson definitely deserves one.)",Rent

I know that local theater teenagers really liked the stage version, and it was sort of a rite of passage to see the stage version, but I never went or saw the play.Everyone is talking about the stage version vs the film. I think what may be lost is the story, the sheer emotion of living with the threat HIV/AIDS in the late 80s/early 90s. I remember the terror of getting tested to learn your HIV status and finding out the results. Of possibly knowing you were positive and your potential partner may not be and being afraid to tell them. Being attracted but afraid as Roger was to get involved with Mimi.My 16 yo daughter recently asked her father if there were any gay friends she could interview for a school project, he told her they were all dead. And they are, because of HIV/AIDS.This film brought back so many memories of terror. Not knowing if something you did unthinkingly in the past might have resulted in this terrible deadly disease.Those of you who are younger like the film because of the friendship and faith in adversity message it brings. That is correct, but to those of us who were there, it brings back, in a very poignant way, the past and the truth.And because of that truth, I cried in memory.-Linda",Rent

327,GNOSSIS24,"Should have loved, only liked",5,7 December 2005,"This musical holds a special place in my heart. I remember when i first bought the Broadway recording in 1994, I was just finishing elementary school and on my way to freshman hell in a small town high school. The moment the first CD started to play and I heard the characters singing about love, death, AIDS and ""no day but today"", I felt I had found a group of ""friends"" I could connect with. At the young age of fifteen I had yet to come out to my mom, and here I was listening to people who were so open with their feelings and unafraid to be who they were. As the years passed and my original copy of ""RENT"" quickly wearing out, I told my mom that I was gay and, of course, she already knew. My senior year of high school, we were allowed the chance to take a trip to Chicago to see a staged production of ""RENT"" and my mom came with me. It was a gripping and emotional show from start to finish....it was perfection. Now, at 25, after seeing a filmed version of a show that has affected me so much, I wish they had simply filmed the stage version, as they did with the recent ""Jesus Christ Superstar"". I also feel that perhaps they should have gone with a cast of unknowns. I feel so terrible saying this, but I felt almost no emotion from anyone that was in the original cast, with the exception of Jesse L. Martin, whose winning smile and charming goofiness lit up the screen. I believe that the original cast succeeded years ago on stage and on the original recording due to the fact that they were, indeed, starving artists. They were all primarily unknowns, waiting for the right chance to be recognized and ""RENT"" was that chance. They were full of a certain angst that I believe comes with youth that was well suited for a show that dealt with anger, love and loss. Now, they have accomplished so much and have had great success, they don't seem to be in the same emotional state of desperation. For example, Adam Pascal has recorded a few CDs and has been in Broadway productions since ""RENT"" and has been recognized for his vocal talents. Yet, the character ""Roger"", who is ""writing one great song"", was best suited for him ten years ago when no one knew who he was. Back then, Adam Pacal, being on stage without a rock band that he was so used to being a part of, had to show to the world that he had what it took to be a great singer and talent. My main problem with the film is Chris Columbus. I was ready to see him do something that would prove to me he was more than a screen writer of ""Home Alone"" films and director of ""Harry Potter"". I was ready for him to ""wow"" me with ""RENT"" as Joel Schumacher did with ""The Phantom of the Opera"". I wanted him to show me that he was worth more than the sum of his parts. Unfortunately, his love for this show was not enough to keep him from destroying a number of songs. ""Take Me or Leave Me"" was botched from the get go. It was completely absurd to have the song take place at a commitment engagement party, with Joanne and Maureen's parents present. The parents should have never been seen. Instead they should have been disembodied voices on an answering machine as they were in the play. The party-goers should not have followed the fighting couple throughout the building as if they were anticipating a cat-fight of biblical proportions....this is not high school...or ""Grease"" for that matter. The fight between the two should have been a private moment. The song is strong enough with out having to fill the screen with unnecessary commotion. Another point of contention with a musical number is ""No Day But Today"". The fact that Colombus thought that Mimi needed to go out into the street and sing at the building with Roger on the fire escape was ludicrous. Not to mention the fact that Mark, Angel and Collins happen to come walking down the street in time for the chorus was simply embarrassing. It would have made more sense to keep the argument confined to the building between Roger and Mimi and have in the distance of the loft the AIDS group softly lit singing the chorus. The argument is supposed to coincide with the meeting of the AIDS group. I just get the feeling that as much as Chris Columbus says the musical has affected him, he just didn't seem to have enough trust that the music is strong enough to stand on it's own without the need of nifty camera-work and unnecessary locations. There were many more problems with film, yet I have only so much space to list them in.",Rent
328,luvinlife217,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,4 March 2006,"I absolutely love this movie. Adam Pascal is the most amazing actor ever! I really wish they wouldn't have taken the scene ""Halloween"" out. I believe that Anthony Rapp was amazing in that scene, and it also made many connections that some audience members who hadn't seen the show on Broadway may not have noticed. Rent, which is a modern version of Puccinni's opera, La Boheme, is the movie that changed my view on life. Now I live every moment as my last. Rent, being the story of 7 friends and a landlord, shows a year in the life of Bohemeians. Marc, Roger, Mimi, Angel, Collins, Maureen, Joanne, and (sometimes) Benny are the greatest group of friends shown in a movie since Crossroads(for lack of a better movie). Though they fight a lot, they move past it to see each other for who they really are; not just Bohemeians, lesbians, gays, AIDS carriers, exotic dancers, drug abusers, drag queens, performers, lawyers, landlords, filmmakers, songwriters, poor people with no money at all. They saw past all of that to see 8 people who in their own way are just like everyone else. I have learned to see this. That is what Jonathan Larson wanted us to do, right? rent- n. a split in a party, community, or group. Jonathan wanted to show not only what the tenants had to pay to their landlord, but the split in the groups of life. ""How can you connect in an age where strangers, landlords, lovers, your own blood cells betray? What binds a fabric together when the raging, shifting winds of change keep ripping away?""-Rent There were many schisms in this small group of people; imagine how many there are all over the world. So many things change within us over time. These people unconditionally made up for it for each other and were always there. They were there when a friend was sick or died, when a couple split up or came together, when someone needed a little help or money, when we needed to hear something we were trying to to block from our ears, when we needed to see what we didn't see the first time. That is why we have friends and that is why friendship is thicker than blood. Remember there is ""No Day But Today""........""Viva La Vie Boheme""",Rent

What other masterpieces he could have written, we'll never know.The music was absolutely beautiful, although the ""big song"" that Roger was dying to write wasn't really that good. One Song Glory was definitely better.I did find the fact that almost everyone had AIDS to be a bit much. But I guess back in the late 80s and early 90s it was more of an issue than now. Mind you, if I wasn't as much of an unfeeling robot as I am, I would have totally broken down into tears during the scenes from Life Support especially where the members started to just vanish.Maureen's character totally annoyed me though. The whole warehouse ""concert"" scene was totally lame. I would have given it a perfect 10 if not for that scene.

She is electrifying and hit the nail on the head with her performance. Idina Menzel was great except for a certain protest scene which was completely botched and even painful to watch, however ""take me or leave me"" completely makes up for this. Of course the movie has flaws but it is an excellent movie.",Rent
333,je_suis_etonnant,"Good, But Below My Expectations",8,23 November 2005,"Let me start out by saying I have never seen the stage musical Rent, nor seen the opera La Bohème, nor read Scènes de la vie de bohème. Therefore, this movie was my first experience with the plot and characters of this moving story. These friends living their 'last' year in New York show unwittingly through their life events and reactions the writer's views on how life, be it a year or 100 years, should be spent--the rousing number ""525600 minutes"" says it best: ""In 525600 minutes / How do you measure a year in the life? / [...] How about love? / [...] Measure in love / Seasons of love.""The songs were excellent; the acting ranged from average to very good, which is amazing considering musicals rarely employ well-acted emotion or struggle. I really only have two complaints: ***THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS*** a) I felt cheated at the end from the old trick of having Mimi seeming dead while no one did or said anything. She then, of course, twitched her finger and was miraculously fine and able to participate in the closing number while looking amazingly good for having spent 3 weeks living in the park & recovering from a crack addiction. b) The movie seemed to go on too long, plain and simple. The ending seemed rushed but the middle kind of dragged on. The first, say, 45 minutes were next to perfect, though.Basically, to sum up, Rent was very good. I think it made a great transition from stage to screen because I couldn't picture it as a stage production thanks to great cinematography and acting. I would recommend it.",Rent
334,adboy68,Rent to own this musical-lover's dream,10,21 November 2005,"As a confessed ""renthead"" who has seen the stage version five times, it has been an apprehension filled two years waiting for the screen version of this movie to appear at the local megaplex. Tonight, all fears were alleviated when the first strains of the piano intro to ""Seasons of Love"" played over a dark theater.Without giving away too many cinematic flourishes, the story follows the Broadway play to the letter, and even fleshes out a bit of the ""offstage"" bits that are only mentioned in passing. The director utilizes flashbacks, montages, and fantasy sequences to break up the monotony of transferring a stage set to screen. In much the same way ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" break the mold, ""Rent"" allows creative license to dictate entirely new settings, while utilizing much of the dialogue from deleted songs as spoken word. The effect is amusing (to those who know the soundtrack by heart) but also expository to the uninitiated who would probably be lost without hearing the songs several times.The movie's climax actually is more touching and bittersweet than the stage version due to the director's use of music and tight closeups which add to the intimacy.At the end of the sneak preview, the audience clapped, and lots of people stayed to watch the credits -- the sign of any great movie... and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. See it -- no day but today!",Rent

336,mr_mcculley-1,"Good, but uneven",7,23 November 2005,"MY BIASBriefly, I have seen Rent on Broadway with the original cast and thoroughly enjoyed it. I own the soundtrack, but I have never gone to the lengths of ""Rentheads"" that pay Broadway money to see it 18 times or camp out for tickets. From my point of view, here is what worked well and what didn't.THE GOODThe original cast and two newcomers (who fit right) all sing and act their hearts out. Though some performances are stronger than others it is mainly due the constraints of the script (really, what else can Taye Diggs do as Benny other then stand there and roll his eyes?). Standouts include the dazzling Idina Menzel who lights up the screen as Maureen. She has conquered Broadway, Hollywood may be next. I found Mark to have more gravity in the film than on Broadway and I thought Rosario Dawson actually created a better interpretation of Mimi than her theater counterpart.Certain numbers were staged imaginatively and with energy, such as Tango Maureen & La Vie Boheme.And, though it took time to get used to for those familiar with the original, I actually liked the decision to have actors speak some of the song lyrics rather than sing them.The music is still soulful, inventive and touching.THE BADColumbus would have been well advised to change certain things for the movie. Many songs seem to endlessly repeat and refrain, which builds emotion on stage and sometimes covers for changing scenery, but on screen it makes scenes needlessly long. Synthesizers sounded fine when a live band is doing them, but on film it sounds like the actors are singing over karaoke tracks (Tomorrow For Me).The pacing is good in parts and sometimes Godawful. Somewhere between the therapy group and the protest we go nowhere slow.It seems EVERY SINGLE SCENE has the same fade in and fade out! What, is Columbus doing this on iMovie?Choices of what songs to include (Out Tonight) and exclude (And It's Beginning to Snow) make no sense since the latter is more cinematic in scope.The cinematography has too many closeups and lingers. I do not wish to see Adam Pascal's nose hairs for 40 seconds of Your Eyes. Singing people look weird when they are in your face. It breaks the suspension of disbelief.FINAL ANALYSISI enjoyed myself at the movie and recommend you go see it, but I fear Columbus missed the opportunity to make good movie into a classic. While I am glad this musical is recorded for posterity, lots of it looks dated in 2005 and I fear it risks being easily forgotten. For Rent:The Movie, I think there may be NO DAY BUT TODAY.PS--The friend I viewed this movie with had never seen the show and enjoyed the film anyway.",Rent

Oh yeah, and the music is so beautifully excellent! Its got such spunk, and it is so different you are just glued to the screens, I wish I had seen it on Broadway with the original cast.It makes you laugh and cry! A beautiful story of love, friendship, hardship, and fighting AIDs as a family of friends. Every character has there own style and they are all so unique.

338,Num1TomFeltonFan,A tribute to Jonathan Larson and all the original cast,10,26 August 2006,"The movie itself is amazing. It captures the emotion and talent of the original cast, with many of them improving on the role. There is good and bad about the movie, but the good outweighs the bad.The good: Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, his love for the work is obvious, and his vocals ring loud and clear throughout the movie.Idina Menzel as Maureen Johnson, it is true what they say in the commentary. Without the 90s hair and attitude, she really shines as the drama queen. Her voice has only improved, and she seems to be the closest to her character.Wilson Jermaine Heredia as Angel Dummott Shunard. Probably the sweetest role I have ever seen. He is another person who is obviously attached to his character Taye Diggs as Benjamin Coffin III. There is far too little Taye in this movie, but he lights up the screen whenever he is on it.-- The Bad: Chris Columbus: I'm not sure he fully understood the play. He took out a few crucial songs, and left a couple plot lines fall flat.Rosario Dawson: I'm sorry, this is probably the worst choice in the entire movie. Her voice, is mediocre at best. If they wanted to use a bigger star, there were many other choices.-- As a whole, the movie is great for anyone who has the OBC soundtrack, or has seen Rent on Broadway. It is a testament to the original stars, and the roles they made their own. If you want the whole story, go see it live. If you want to see the best cast to ever perform the musical, and Rent 15 tickets are too expensive, this is the movie to see.It is much more of a teen draw than Chicago. It has much more of an adult draw than High School Musical. It is everything a musical should be, and will be a classic for years to come, as certain people go on to be huge stars.I'd recommend it to anyone.",Rent
339,DWeiser05,What a great movie musical!,9,25 November 2005,"I've had the privilege of seeing Rent twice and I was thrilled to see that the movie was so similar to the musical. Any changes that were made I felt were for the betterment of the movie. Some of the songs were edited, either shortening or lengthening. Additional verses of La Vie Boheme were enjoyable. The cast did a great job. I was extremely impressed with Rosario Dawson. I would have expected nothing less from the original Broadway cast. Overall the director did a great job of taking Rent off the stage and into the scenery of New York. Just go see it! If you loved the musical, you'll love the movie. If you haven't seen the musical, you'll still love the movie.",Rent
340,victoriahines,Better than expected,10,24 November 2005,"Having been a Rent fan since the original cast began in 1996, I rejoiced to learn that the majority of the cast would be returning for the film. The movie, at first, appeared to potentially struggle along. However, by the end you are so moved from the cast performances that you can't envision it being filmed in any other way. I told my friend on the way home that I had anticipated the film to be rewritten and directed toward the film audience, yet they kept true to the soundtrack and there is little dialogue throughout the entire movie. Sound like a bad idea? Wrong, the songs are so expressive that dialogue is unnecessary. If you are not a fan of musicals or controversial issues like AIDS and gay relationships, this movie will disgust you. If you are willing to put aside those stereotypes and listen to the wonderful song writing and great performances, this is the film to see.",Rent
341,showtyme_sinergy,Rent is well worth the wait!,10,28 November 2005,"I waited for years, catching bits of information as to what was prolonging the completion of the movie-version of the hit Broadway musical Rent. As the lights came down in the Hoyts theatre, it felt like only yesterday that I heard the song ""Seasons of Love"" for the first time.There were some changes in the chronology of the plot, as well as some of the songs, which actually stream-lined the story into a much more intense and moving tale. The most amazing part of the movie for me was the JOY that all of the actors had for each other. I have never before seen such an ensemble. It's easy to believe the love that they hold for each other must also carry out into the real world.The ""comicness"" of Maureen and Joanne's relationship was tailored down in a positive way, and allowed me to care more about their relationship than I did in the stage version.Rosario Dawson is an amazing find! She seemed to fit in with the cast effortlessly, and it was hard to imagine that she was not part of the original legacy.A couple of the songs did seem to start out of the blue, without much transition, but the passion immersed in the songs more than made up for this small flaw. It's hard to imagine that after 10 years, the cast could re-imagine the songs with emotions that sound as if it's the first and only time they get to sing their message.I heard a man in the theatre say that this movie would date itself, because of the seeming ""rampantness of the AIDS virus."" I say that this movie capsulates a period of time we can not afford to forget for a group of society that may become desensitized to the threat of HIV, as well as teaches us that each moment is precious. We can't afford to make choices we'll regret, for there may not be a chance to redeem that moment.",Rent

343,Tollpatsch,Well worth a few hours of your life...,9,1 December 2005,"I was a little concerned going into this one. Rent's such an original show and, although Larson's family and best friend were involved in the project, I wasn't sure how well it would adapt to the screen. My fears were quickly put to rest--I think they did a very good job with it. Some songs were cut and the order of everything was changed around a bit from the original musical which took a little getting used to, but it was no less powerful than live in the theater. Although I was disappointed by the missing songs, the story made more sense without them.The actors actually get a real set to play with this time and definitely take advantage of the cameras and special effects. What I liked most about the movie was the fact that the actors who originated the roles on Broadway were given their roles once again. It's got to be a precedent, but a great one. Those of us who never got to see them on Broadway finally got to see the faces behind the voices, and the new actresses held their own. The new Mimi's voice blends beautifully with Adam Pascal. In any case, there are worse ways to spend a Friday night than watching Rent. They dun good.",Rent

Idina Menzel's, as wonderful as she is, role is probably too comic to gain critical acclaim. Rosario Dawson does a nice job but seems to be out of her league. Tracie Thoms fits in perfectly! Anthony Rapp does a great job, as do Jesse Martin and Wilson Hermedia. Taye Diggs's role is small but he does well.

The talent in the movie is incredible and it consistently moves me every time I watch it. It is a realistic portrayal of a group of individuals who deal with every day struggles that most don't even have to think about, such as AIDS, drug addiction, etc. To see how these individuals support one another and help each other through the difficult times is a lesson for all to see. The acting and singing is superb. My only disappointment with this movie is that it ends. I wish another film would be made as a follow up to this one, not only for the entertainment value, but for the excellent job that it does in opening people's eyes to the real world. I love this movie and I would encourage everyone to see it.",Rent
347,resq446,An excellent adaptation of the stage musical,8,4 November 2005,"""Rent"" is an excellent adaptation of the stage musical. It is handsomely filmed and very well acted. The movie version takes the story out into city's real locations.Most of this movie is singing, but it is so well done it never breaks the 'suspension of disbelief' that as an audience we grant the fiction we are watching.This 'rock operetta' is about a group loft-dwelling 'Bohemian' New Yorkers, some of whom have AIDS. The stage version has a devoted following of 'Rentheads' including director Chris Columbus, for whom this film was a labor of love.I saw it with several young people and they really connected with the story's message of friendship, tolerance and living every day to the fullest. Some elderly members of the audience thought the music was being played too loud and they couldn't identify with the lifestyle depicted in the story.This movie could attain the cult status of the stage musical.",Rent
348,jpoling-1,incredible,3,8 December 2005,"I know a suspension of disbelief is sometimes necessary for musicals, but since Rent is a ""reality-based"" musical tackling such heavy subjects as the homeless, housing, and AIDS, I found it hard to get around the fact that these two struggling artists are living in a warehouse-sized loft. What about a studio? A railroad flat? People would kill for a space like that in new York. Also, you don't hand-crank an 8mm camera DURING filming, (certainly Chris Columbus must know this?) and there's no way, in 1990, that his 8mm home-movie footage could have gotten him a job with a major news show. Having said that, I can still understand why some people have a soft place in their heart for it.",Rent
349,Dreamachieverps,Excellent Film Version of a Broadway Sensation,10,25 November 2005,"Let me be brief and simply say that for someone who has seen ""Rent"" the Broadway musical twice, I was thrilled with this film version. I left the theater completely satisfied that this awesome musical was well translated onto the big screen. Keeping the majority of the Original Broadway Cast was brilliant and led to a wonderful treatment. The pacing was right on track and the editing of the stage version was minimal. Creating film versions of stage shows always seems to be quite challenging and the big screen versions often seem to come up short of the mark. That's definitely not the case with ""Rent"". The performances were wonderful as expected from the cast. I saw the film on Friday night with a sold out audience and there was heavy applause at the conclusion and a lot of singing with the credits as we exited. Clearly my fellow audience members shared my enthusiasm for what we had just seen. I am eager to see it again and own it on DVD. Kudos to Chris Columbus for a job very well done.",Rent
350,mjshaw_98,"Interesting, but not so great!",6,18 November 2005,"Perhaps never having seen the play Rent caused me to not be so overwhelmed by this movie. However, I have seen the Opera La Boheme, and although the similarities are there, I still think the heroine needs to succumb, the miraculous return to life of Mimi, seemed to pull the power out of the film. While I can say most of the singing is well done, I never did feel much sympathy for any of the characters, they all seemed pretty self centered, except for maybe Angel, and of course with a name like Angel, we would expect him to somehow have an impact on everyones life. Meanwhile, having lived through this period, and having seen many people die due to AIDS, I thought perhaps I might be a little more moved, and yet found the films somewhat draggy in parts, with only two or three exceptional numbers that made me sit up and notice. Perhaps I was expecting to much, and hoping that I would really fall in love with the film, but it never really drew me in, except for a few moments. In my opinion the film is going to have very limited appeal, and I don't think will be around very long, so you might have to run out and see it. Perhaps Chris Columbus needs to stick with the kid oriented pictures, he may have been out of his league and wasn't able to bring enough edginess to the film.",Rent

It's tedious, superficial, drama-free, and looks like an advertisement for Abercrombie & Fitch. The musical numbers are endless, with bland instrumentation and poor choreography, and the plot spends too much time bouncing about without adding any weighty elements (yes some of the characters have AIDS but it takes the script forever to address it). The whole time I just wanted to yell GET A JOB at the characters. I mean seriously, you can still pursue art while working a part time job, and then at least you'll be able to keep your sick friends warm and fed. What whiny losers.I've seen and rather enjoyed the Broadway musical, so I know this could be so much more. The problem is that this movie lacks the musical's raw energy, and the script did not make the improvements to plot and character development necessary for the silver screen. Finally, Chris Columbus is a hack director, look at how much better the Potter movies got when Cuaron took the reigns in the 3rd one. This gets two stars just because some of the actors (particularly Jesse Martin) did quite decent jobs. Go rent Chicago for a musical with style or Pennies from Heaven for a musical with heart.",Rent

Lines of gender, education, talent, sexual orientation and all-around stereotypes are not only blurred, but totally erased and exemplified in what life should really be about - love. Jesse L.

360,buymyapartment,Disappointed deeply,5,24 November 2005,"Criticisms notwithstanding, you have to give kudos to the extremely gutsy choice to cast virtually all of the original cast members in their original roles. Five of the eight principals are completely unknown outside of Broadway. Even the three 'known' actors aren't exactly household names or guaranteed box-office draws. In an era of star-driven films, wherein studios greenlight atrocious scripts but hedge their bets by making sure to cast at least one big-name actor, here is a film that was willing to let the content rather than the conduits carry the picture. And what has better content than Rent? (Still, they managed to screw it up. But bad as this film was, you can't fault the actors, who are mostly first-rate. Can you imagine how much worse it would have been if Justin Timberlake were shaking his booty to La-vie-Boheme? I shudder at that possibility...and reportedly, he was considered seriously). Less gutsy is the choice of humdrum mainstream director Chris Columbus. A lot has been made of this. Truthfully, I don't know enough about the nuances and subtleties of directing to understand how the overall feeling of the film could have differed with a 'hipper' director. But I can say that cheesy directorial decisions, like doing a slow close-up on a character going through an emotional moment, and the ultimate B-movie ridiculousness -- making us believe that a character is dead, only to focus the camera on their twitching pinky finger to prove otherwise -- is downright nauseating, the ultimate cliché, and has no place in a show as revolutionary, fresh and different as Rent.There's good pizza and there's bad pizza, but even a 'bad' pizza is still pizza, still the most delicious food. The same can be said of Rent. It was long, it failed to stir up emotion in this reviewer whose eyes still well-up every time he sees the stage version, the plot holes were magnified, and it just seemed 'fake'...but it's still Rent. The music is phenomenal (why, oh why, if you were making the film so damn long anyway, couldn't you include the stupendous 'Goodbye Love'?!?), the performances are as authentic as it gets, and the story is like nothing else ever done on Broadway. I will undoubtedly see it again, will buy the DVD, and recommend that all do the same.But for goodness' sake, see this magnificent show on Broadway while you still can. It is an epic, a legend, a real watershed. Seeing a Polaroid photograph of a beautiful object is nice. But it doesn't hold a candle (light a candle?) to beholding the real thing. You still have the opportunity to do so. Do it!ADDITIONAL MUSINGS...much has been made of the fact that director Chris Columbus did not shy away from depicting homosexual kisses (both male and female) on screen. Given that that's not something you see everyday in mainstream Hollywood pictures, yeah, I guess he deserves kudos for that. But notice that the kisses between Maureen/Joanne and Angel/Collins are only slight little pecks on the lips! Now, I have no problem with a film eschewing overt or gratuitous sexuality, even in a film suffused with as much sexual energy as this one. Had Columbus chosen to have all of the characters kiss this way, it would've been fine. But Mimi/Roger give each other full tongue kisses! When is Hollywood going to learn that homosexual people love each other -- and display that love -- the same way the rest of us do!...On the 'forgiveness' factor for script discombobulation or failure to develop story lines in a fleshed out way...as I said before, we're willing to grant certain leniencies on stage that we just can't allow on film. A prime example of the stark contrast between the media, and how utilizing a technique that's forigvable in one media is blasphemous in another, is Mimi's near death scene at the end of the piece. In the play, when she 'comes back to life', the company bursts into a celebratory, life-affirming song that hits all the right notes, literally and figuratively. At the screening of the film that I saw, when Mimi 'wakes up' and everyone spontaneously bursts into song and proceeds to watch Mark's movie, the audience burst into uproarious laughter. I heard the same happened in another screening. It's a terrible, fake, unrealistic, and jarring moment....Anyone else get the sense that this played more like a musical revue than a narrative film? As one long, drawn-out number morphed into yet another, with nary an emotional twinge in sight, I got the sense that the cast was essentially saying 'hey! Let's perform this song! And now, let's do that song!', in an entirely disconnected, unaffecting way....Jesse Martin, the man with the most experience of all of these actors (at least on camera), was the weakest of the bunch, acting-wise. He seemed to be overacting, wearing all of his emotions on his face at all times, whether it was a smile in the happy times or a frown in the sad ones. There was no depth to his performance, although his voice is stupendous. And Angel, a character whose energy really carries the stage version of 'Rent', was decidedly docile, despite all his flamboyance, here.... Speaking of Angel, Chris Columbus erred in showing him out of drag so often in the early going of the piece. In the play, the first time we see Angel without his whole get-up is at the time of his demise. When this larger than life, flamboyant character is shown lying on a hospital bed, shivering and cold, his illness really hits you. Seeing him without his drag is like seeing the Wizard without the curtain or the Emperor without his clothes...he looks, in essence, naked, alone, and vulnerable. But a good chunk of the emotional effect that comes from seeing a giant fall is lost when you've already seen him out weakened throughout the film.",Rent
361,secretary_of_funk,a leap of faith...,8,25 November 2005,"""Rent"" has been moving audiences and converting fans for almost a decade now, and while a film seemed to be the most natural progression, it wasn't without its setbacks. Originally a Spike Lee project with Justin Timberlake and Jennifer Lopez (as Angel, no less...) to star, translating the vibrant, evocative saga of eight interwoven lives in late-1980s New York was, as Maureen would say, ""a leap of faith"". The result, while not without some notable flaws, still has the passion and power of Larson's original.The acting, to say the least, is absolutely stellar. Mostly comprised of veteran cast members who understand the power of Larson's words, the cast is dynamic and the performances resonate with the same strength they did almost a decade ago, transcending Columbus's directorial shortcomings. Anthony Rapp is a consistently great Mark Cohen, heightening every awkward moment and rapturous outburst to its fullest and throws all of himself down on the table during ""La Vie Bohéme"", probably the best number in the film. Jesse L. Martin is breathtaking as the lovable anarchist Collins...when he sings ""when your heart has expired"" at Angel's funeral, you can see the chills going down the spines of audience members. Newcomers Rosario Dawson (Mimi) and Tracie Thoms (Joanne) bring new life to the roles. Thoms has an incredible vocal range and brings to the screen an approachable, lovable version of the meticulous Joanne. Dawson is full of energy and makes the audience howl during an exuberant rendition of ""Out Tonight"". Veterans Taye Diggs (Benny), Wilson Jermaine Heredia (Angel), and Idina Menzel (Maureen) stay true to form and also offer great performances. Comedian Sarah Silverman as the sleazy network exec Alexi Darling is an added bonus. The only cast member that fails to transcend the film's shortcomings is Adam Pascal (Roger). He has his moments during ""Another Day"" and ""Light My Candle"" but even at his best, he is upstaged by Dawson and Rapp. His songs are reduced to cheesy montages, and whereas the already schmaltzy ""Your Eyes"" is evocative and tragic on stage, it is reduced to a cheesy pop anthem here.Columbus's directing may be the film's greatest obstacle. At its worst, it resorts to the ""sentimental montage"" technique, in some cases tainting Larson's plot. Angel's last moments are tied in via montage with Mimi's disappearance and are not given justice. ""One Song Glory"" possesses the same spirit, but the hospital's HIV notification destroys the shock of Larson's lyric about how April ""left him a note saying 'We've got AIDS' before slitting her wrists in the bathroom"". ""What You Own"" lacks finesse and is almost laughable with Pascal against the New Mexico canyons.At best, however, the directing is also outstanding. He recognizes that the city and the play are inseparable, and, at least in the first half of the movie, creates a stellar portrait of the Lower East Side. Illuminated by burning eviction notices drifting to the ground and the rising defiant voices of Bohemia, the title number has never looked so fabulous. The elaborate lights and TV screens of ""Over The Moon"" give Menzel's passion-play a new energy that complements her dazzling performance that would make anyone moo at the top of their lungs.Technical aspects aside, the film's greatest strength is in its message, its passion, and its love...In many of the reviews I've read so far, the story is dismissed for being pretentious and inaccessible. In the title number, Mark rages against the futility of trying to ""connect in an age where strangers, landlords, lovers, your own blood cells betray"". And it seems easy to distance yourself from Larson's Gen-X grab-bag bohemians at first. But, while the women of Wisteria Lane cheat and connive, celebrities treat marriage like a holiday weekend, and the Laguna kids make a mockery of our generation...the characters of ""Rent"" become a breath of fresh air. The story, at its heart, is about relationships...about ""being an us -- for once -- instead of a 'them'."" Collins and Angel share a love with incredible passion and depth. Roger and Mimi save each other. And despite frequent fallouts, they are always willing to forgive and redeem. If only we were so lucky to have a friend like Angel, a lover like Collins, a roommate like Mark. The beauty of ""Rent"" is in how it makes us appreciate the ""us"" in our lives.And that lingering silence throughout the theatre at the end of the film? That's the sound of understanding.",Rent
362,lasciata,"This is not your father's ""La Boheme""",3,25 November 2005,"Any coincidence between this apocalyptic version of Puccini's ""La Boheme"" and the original is purely a stratagem of the producers, attempting to bootstrap an agonizingly bad production on the fame of a classic.Puccini wrote music; Jonathan Larson wrote screams. Puccini's librettists conceived an actual story that has transcended generational and societal boundaries; Larson's book will appeal principally to cross-dressing, drug-addicted failures on the lower east side of Manhattan who believe that having rent-free accommodations in one of the world's most expensive cities is a matter of right.What should have been, and what is promoted as being, a synthesis of ""Angels in America"" and ""Hair"" sadly turns out to be little more than an overly long, boring story of some wingless, bald, sexually-confused people. And they yell a lot. For a long, long time.",Rent
363,bernicehamel,Rent had some wonderful surprises,7,29 November 2005,"This film surprised me with its emotional power and beauty. In the beginning I had a hard time settling in with its unusual style and what seemed to me to be unfocused or mixed direction. In fact, I actually found the first 20 or so minutes awkward. I thought it seemed almost an amateur production -- so I actually toyed with the idea of leaving the theater--which I've done only a couple of times in my life. (I love movies way too much to squander the time I've already committed to seeing a flick.)....Well, anyway, I gave myself permission to ""adjust"" to what seemed to be a strange mix (because at first it seemed that the movie couldn't make up its mind to be either a ""musical"" or a ""drama."") But, to make a long story short, I settled down and ended up being totally captivated by the entire production -- minus those introductory 20 or so minutes. I loved the music, the message, and most of all -- the outstanding performances. It's not a perfect film (but what is?). However, I do recommend Rent as a work of art.",Rent
364,cassilee85,Unfortunately this movie never found it's voice,3,25 June 2008,"In general I enjoy musicals and gritty dramas. I thought the combination had so much potential and could be spectacular. But this movie wasn't.The first half is uninteresting. The characters are suppose to be interesting and edgy, but I never felt like I got to know them. When translating a musical from stage to cinema certain changes are required. The first half of the movie was stifled by a lack of dialgoue from all the main characters. Songs are over-the-top, and dialogue brings realism and truth to the format. Throughout the first half the characters rarely spoke, the only insights into their character came when they burst out in song without any meaningful transition. Dialogue could have made the actors more believable in their homosexual/cross gender roles, but as the movie was I didn't believe them.The movie seemed disjointed and had no consistent voice. I was particularly bothered that 2/3 of the way through there was a random voice-overs. Voice overs can work if they are used well and consistently, but this omnipresence voice from the sky came out of nowhere. To me this summed up the problems with the whole movie: It never figured out it's voice or who it wanted to be. I wanted to give this movie a higher score due to potential or edginess, but I can't. The movie lost itself and just didn't work.",Rent

With 6 of the 8 main actors in the original Broadway productions--how can it be bad. And the two actors who weren't both started on Broadway.

The critics have spoken about ""cliches"", ""awkward camera angles"", and ""odd editing"". While I can't deny that there are some odd decisions made with the cinematography of the film, I believe the critics are not paying attention to what this film tells its viewers: to live each day as your last, despite whatever obstacles you may be facing.

Back in the day (at least from what my mom tells me) it was expected for characters to break into song. Chicago had the interesting approach of making it all in a characters head, but you can't pull that trick in Rent.It was great to see the original cast back, and Rosario Dawson was a nice addition.

It was funny and sad without being too much of either.I now regret never seeing the show on Broadway with the original cast. They were uniformly great.

I felt nothing towards the characters because the actors didn't build a connection with me through the character. The story line is somewhat interesting but I cannot feel any compassion for Rosario Dawnson's character. She gets involved with drugs and suddenly becomes a bum on the street. Maybe it is the actress herself who makes the character unpleasing both vocally and dramatically. Had she not screeched through three numbers I may have enjoyed the feature a bit more.

The original cast may have been able to pull this off on stage 10 years ago when they were under 40 years old.

The soundtrack is horrible, containing a whole bunch of people talking in sing song style. Though ""One song"" is a particularly catchy piece, the rest of the soundtrack is banal and annoying. The acting isn't particularly noteworthy. For a musical translated to a movie, it is the worst one i've seen. It hardly competes with Fiddler on the Roof or the lacking Phantom of the Opera.

It was powerful and comedic at times (which is a huge concern of mine). The 525,600 minutes song stuck so far into my head. They were very talented actors and singers. Another strong aspect is the addressing of AIDS. Freddie Mercury (Queen) and Easy E (NWA) were very talented individuals especially Fred. I miss Freddie and the impersonators can't come near him {sniffle}. Easy was in NWA, the only rap group I'll listen to . So what was I talking about? Oh yeah Rent. Good movie.

Despite the talented performers (Jesse Marting in particular), the movie never rises above the level of a high school musical production. It is schmaltzy where it should be moving and chaotic instead of having a focused energy. The stage production of this show has been running on Broadway for ten years and the movie makers have chosen not to update it at all (it is set in 1990) which gives the whole thing a very dated feel. The fact that nearly all of the original cast members, who are now much too old for their parts, star in the movie adds to the feeling of fossilization permeating throughout.

381,Killian-5,Squat,2,28 November 2005,"Okay, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely up there (or, rather, down there). I have never seen ""Rent"" on stage, so it's possible that the show is every bit as awful as the movie - but the film's misguided direction can only have made it worse. Then again, Chris Colombus is said to have cut about half an hour's worth of material from the original, so I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies.Jonathan Larson essentially took Puccini's La Bohème, ditched the excellent music, replaced it with astronomically pedestrian pop tunes, and undermined the only effective dramatic moment in the whole thing. In the process, he also degraded the entire notion of Bohemianism, as well as artistic expression, political activism, and even love itself. No small feat.Larson's Bohemia is the East Village of the 1990s (about ten years after it had already been gentrified beyond recognition) and the main problem with his characters - apart from the couple of yuppies - is that they appear to be completely talentless middle-class kids who aren't so much suffering for their art as being too damned lazy to stop pretending that they're aesthetes and get a job. What we do see - the performance art of Maureen (Idina Menzel), the one song that took Roger (Adam Pascal) over a year to compose - is juvenile, cliché-ridden and embarrassing. ""Today 4 U"", the film Mark (Anthony Rapp) finally unveils at the end of the whole sorry mess, IS the worst movie I've ever seen.The overriding problem, though, is that these characters are so pretentious, so maudlin, and so self-involved that not only are they totally unsympathetic, but they are also characters that REAL Bohemians would detest. I rather suspect they'd detest Larson's Broadway musical, as well. The story is about as unconventional as a blueberry muffin.Benny (Taye Diggs) is one of the only characters who is occasionally believable. He is the ostensibly unlikeable nouveau riche landlord who, due to the self-aggrandizing excesses of all the other characters, comes off as the single compelling human being in the entire thing - and that's without the moment of redemption that was apparently excised for brevity's sake (which deprives the film of a resolution to its only real conflict and rather defeats the purpose of, well... drama).Except for Rosario Dawson (as Mimi), who is so restrained that neither her ill health or her smack habit extend much beyond her make-up, the remaining performances are determinedly stage-bound: florid, mannered, and thoroughly unconvincing.The same can pretty much be said for the entire undertaking. Colombus starts the whole thing - inexplicably - on a stage, with the main characters standing spotlit in a line singing the film's single memorable song, ""Seasons of Love"" (which is really only memorable because they sing it about thirty-seven times during the course of two-and-a-quarter hours). At first I thought this was going to be some kind of framing device - that, at the end of the film, we would find that the central characters had decided to dramatize their story and that we would end up with them back on stage rehearsing the tale to which we had just been subjected. But, no - the opening served no purpose whatsoever - except, maybe, to subtly let us know that the acting was going to be coarse because most of these people had only ever appeared on Broadway and were used to playing to the second balcony rather than the camera.Colombus abandons the staginess of the opening for what I assume is meant to be some sort of gritty realism. There's certainly enough litter and graffiti and flaming rubbish and cracker crumbs strewn about his almost realistic sound-stage settings. Someone should maybe have told him, though, that the musical is about as UNnaturalistic a medium as one can conceive and that mixing the idioms is destined for failure.In any event, I found myself looking at my watch before all of the main characters had even been introduced, which shouldn't be considered a good sign. By the time we got to the second finale over two hours later and, as the dead Mimi miraculously (and laughably) came back to life due to the divine intervention of a dead drag queen, Roger was singing, ""Thank God this moment's not the last"", I was thinking, ""Good God - it's NOT???"" Fortunately, apart from a pointless final montage, it was. And, for the first time in years, I left before the first credit had rolled off the screen.Ah, well, it seems that fans of the stage musical are mostly loving it to death. I suspect, though, that this is akin to what Blanket Woman (Aisha De Haas) says of Mark's filming of her attack by policemen: ""Just trying to use me to kill his guilt. It's not that kind of movie, honey."" On the contrary: ""Rent"" is exactly that kind of movie. Its middlebrow audience can watch it, weep at the funeral of Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), feel bad about Mimi's drug habit, click their tongues at a bag lady or two and coddle themselves with the notion that, somehow, they've FELT something - and, by extension, DONE something (at long last) - about problems like the AIDS epidemic, homelessness, and addiction - then go back to their complacent little beds and forget all about it.",Rent
382,754293,Love without regret.,10,24 November 2005,"A perfect ALMOST-but-not-quite 10 year tribute to the musical hit by Jonathan Larson.I would have to agree with the Rent blog where Columbus was able to stay true to the original story, and taking it to the next level with the medium that he had chosen, and achieving both, preserving its integrity, and letting 'Rent' speak for itself.All too often, transcriptions from any other medium, be it in print, or production lose out due to time considerations. With 'Rent', that doesn't happen.Every aspect from the original story is there, and as a motion picture, I think that it made it easier to convey the stories of the eight incredible individuals.While some would argue that Adam Pascal doesn't have as ""strong"" or ""noticeable"" of a voice, I disagree. I think that he is a very talented singer. Newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms did a tremendous job with their characters.I don't think that I've seen that many people in the theater where I live. Even Star Wars had less people. Although to my surprise, it appears as though most of the people that were in the theater have never heard of 'Rent' before, and I think that it was a VERY pleasant experience for them.I cannot wait until the DVD is released!",Rent

For example, one review I read picked on things like the ""movie"" that Mark made and showed at the end, as well as the forced diversity of the cast. One of the things I liked about this movie was it gave me a chance to see many of the original Broadway performers in action. LOVE Jesse L. Martin!

And in this format, that message does get out to a much larger audience.The only reason I did not rate this film at 10/10: This story and the music in particular has so much energy, and in some cases, that energy did not translate well onto film. My best example is during ""One Song, Glory"": the music is so intense and so dramatic and because of that internal energy, it seems as though Roger should be running, jumping, moving, anything! but he calmly walks back and forth with occasional bursts of movement. It seemed restrained. I don't really consider this such a bad point because of how difficult it truly is to bring the energy of a stage play onto the screen.Warning: you may begin to feel very attached to the characters in this film. Although I'm about as far from New York as they come, these individuals still resemble so many people that I know. They are very human, very easy to relate to.All in all, I would still rate this as one of the best films I've seen in a long while, and as always for me with Rent, I cried through about the last third of it.

Everyone in the cast was wonderful especially the characters of Mimi, Angel, Maureen and Joanne. I've heard people thought the actors were too old for their parts but I don't agree. Go see this movie on the big screen and let's hope for lots of extras on the DVD. I hope it includes Mark's movie. Remember, ""no day but today!""",Rent
386,jstonest,Rent Rules,10,8 April 2006,"I live in Australia and saw the Australian version about 7yrs ago. I loved it so much the first time, i went back 6 times and even went to the finale which I flew down to Melbourne.I can see myself in Mark - someone looking on the outside watching others live their lives, but also in Roger scared to get close to someone....I was so excited to hear they had made a movie and counted down the months, weeks , days, hours till it came out in Australia. We had to wait another 5 months after the US showing.I went with my best girlfriend who had seen RENT the first time with me. On the way in the car, I said to her that I hoped that I wouldn't be disappointed after waiting for so long.I couldn't have ever imagined how wonderful it could be.........For the whole movie I sat on the edge of my seat, not believing that the wonderful musical that I had loved for so long had been made into an amazing movie.I wanted to sing along, but thought I would wait until I could get my hands on the DVD and sing at home.I couldn't fault anything and thought that all the actors had strong performances. The cinematography was amazing and there were so many scenes with just one long shot. Something you can do if you have talented actors.I loved it so much that I went to the movies again the next day.I found out that they are not releasing the DVD version here in Australia, something I cant understand, but luckily a friend lives in the US and bought it for me and sent it via mail. I think i have watched it about 10 times in the last 2 weeks.For those of you who haven't seen it and are scared by the fact that it is mostly singing, be brave and get the movie out. Once you acclimatise yourself to that you will love it.This had better win an Oscar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Rent
387,love_is_paradis3,Great movie...mean guy.,9,14 April 2006,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen! But there were some points where I got bored and wondered when the movie would end. But I liked how RENT was very realistic because AIDS is still out there and is killing innocent people everyday. My favorite part of the movie was in the beginning when Benny comes to collect rent and everybody is screaming that they aren't paying his rent from last year, this year,the next year, and all the years after that. All those people are being really strong for standing up to cruel Benny.Speaking of BENNY. What a JERK! He used to be one of them, without any money, not being able to pay rent. But he gets married and forgets all about that now that he is rich. And plus, he knew Roger and MiMi were dating and that they were very much in love but he STILL went ahead and got with her. PLUS, he is MARRIED. What happened to Benny? What happened to his heart?",Rent
388,cassandravandales,Wonderful Adaption of the Broadway Musical,10,15 April 2006,"I was very septic when I read that RENT would be made into a Movie. Knowing and loving the Musical, I wasn't sure how someone could possibly create the ""right"" atmosphere.The first surprise was that nearly the whole original Broadway Cast starred in the Movie. Very wise decision, as those people really know how to play those roles. Musical stars are in my opinion always a bit better than normal actors when it comes to Musical Movies. Miss Dawson was good, but it was still easy to see that she isn't a Broadway Musical Player. Adam pascal is a great singer and actor, he played Roger as he was meant to be played. Anthony Rapp knows his role as he played it a while and Wilson Jermaine Heredia is simply sweet in his tragic role.Overall, I wouldn't say there was a bad actor which is rather surprising. Only Taye Diggs as Benjamin Coffin III. seemed to be rather pale, but that was surely also because his role was way shorter than in the original Musical. Especially this role has also changed slightly: in the Original, Benjamin was in the end with his old mates again - the movie made a different end here, Benjamin was still the ""Bad Guy"" in a way.There were some changing in the arrangement of the songs as well - and some were missing. I missed ""Happy New Year"" a lot, and some of those single lines. But due to the medium, such was expected.Chris Columbus could show with the Movie some scenes which simply wasn#t possible on stage, for example when Roger drove to Santa Fe and back. Also the scene in the beginning with the burning papers during the song ""RENT"" were impressive. On stage this would be way too dangerous.All in all, the adaption is really great. Some expected shortenings were there, also an addition (the engagement scene surprised me, but it was very well made). Only sad thing was the shortness of Benjamins character. Still, a Ten.",Rent

This movie blew me away, Like Grease and West side story, Rent is our generations film, dealing with AIDs and a social society of artists. A lot can be said about this movie. it's a great adaptation of John Larson's Broadway masterpiece turned to film. Most of the original Broadway cast is present with a few new people, such as: Rosiaro Dawson portraying Mimi Marquez is simply spellbinding. This movie take my breath away every time and for me, whenever I'm in a terrible mood, I put in Rent and i feel a 1000 times better with it's compelling story about AIDS, believable character, addicting and catchy tunes, Rent has a lot and for people who don't like musicals may like this one.

I am 14, ever since 1999, I was listening to the Broadway CD. I loved it, cheesy or not. And when I saw the trailer for RENT to come out in November 2005, I literally screamed. Anyway, I waited and waited and waited and FINALLY it came out. (story of my life) But I was looking at it and I saw that some songs like ""Out Tonight"" and ""Today 4 U"", they changed the lyrics a little. Like ""We won't be back before it's New Years Day,"" was actually ""We won't be back before it's Christmas Day"". And most of the lines in the movie I actually sang to because they were sang in the play! And a thing I didn't like was that ""Contact"" (my favorite song) was taken out. I missed it. Angel is definitely, in my mind, The Pussy Galore drag queen who smashes padlocks with trashcans. So that's a good thing out of the movie. Well, Bye.",Rent
391,reniatria,How can eternal struggles be dated?,10,24 April 2006,"There are always people that are starving and doing without for their art. There are always people who are suffering from disease (remember, La Boheme dealt with consumption) there are always social ills. How can the Bohemian ideal-- which was also shown in La Boheme, and Moulin Rouge, amongst others-- be dated? As long as there are guitarists who skip eating to buy new strings, or writers who have money for paper and ink, but not new clothes, or people fighting against what they see as injustice this show won't be dated. As long as there are groups which are sidelined (in this show, the homeless, gays and lesbians, people with AIDS, people with addictions amongst others) or people who try to stay true to themselves, this show will speak to people. I've had the Broadway soundtrack for years, and while I haven't been able to see it in person yet, I think the film was a wonderful nod to a show that will live on.

It is quite sad to see bohemians tossed out of their apartments and forced to live on the street (though it never happens to the main characters.) The only bad thing i would say is that Mimi wasn't played that good. She was OK i guess. And I think that Angel shouldn't have been cut out of the movie like that. Apart from that, I recommend this to everyone who wishes to look at the slums of New York. However, don't watch it with your parents... the are scenes with homosexuals kissing.",Rent

Mark is my favorite character!!! I absolutely adore Angel, she/he is so adorable! And i love every character actually... You must see this movie! You should buy the movie, the CD, the Broadway CD, tickets to see the Broadway show, buy Anthony Rapp's book, umm and anything that has to do with Rent!

Seeing the movie before seeing the Broadway play left me not knowing what the movie would be like but I assumed the best because of hearing the music lots of times before. When I saw this movie I cried my eyes out! But now I can safely say this is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. After I saw the movie I saw the play, and the movie is WAY better! The music in this is awesome! The movie is about Bohemians living in NYC who are dealing with aids and HIV epidemic. There are also cross dressers and some gay people. But altogether everyone finds a sense of hope and passion. I think one of the main reasons the movie was such a big hit was because of the play, but the plays music isn't as good as the movies. If you get the DVD of RENT then you get over 3 hours of bonus footage, I watched it all and it is awesome. You also should watch the movie with commentary, Chris Columbus (the director) Adam Pascal (Roger) and Anthony Rapp (Mark) they talk a lot about the movie and how it was made! I am pretty young and was aloud to see RENT at a young age in the theaters but I think this is a movie that all teens should see, I am speaking for Moseley and ALL the teens in the world who were completely effected by the emotion in RENT. I know I was, and I know if you have seen it you would know that this is obviously an amazing movie. If you haven't seen it, see it now! Don't waste a second, you will cry, but you will love it! I am going to watch RENT! Thanks for listening! ~a RENT head~",Rent
395,felinefan17,I thought the movie kind of sucked...,7,6 July 2007,"I thought the movie wasn't that good. They took out a lot of important songs. But it has the music that will convince you to see the stage version. I saw the Broadway play in April 2007 at Proctor's and it was 525,600 times better than the movie. And I also think that they should of used the WHOLE original Broadway cast. I don't think Rosario was the right Mimi to bein the movie, and I don't think Chris Columbus knew what the hell he was doing. He needs to stay with the special effects of Hollywood movies, not take the rawness away from RENT. Tracie Thoms was an OK Joanne, but Rosario kind of ruined it. I think that they should of let Daphne be in the movie.",Rent
396,anna_lee03,"Bad Director, Bad Cinematography Ruined Powerful Musical Performances",4,29 April 2006,"What is up with Christopher Columbus??? It looked like he had the stage actors he hired to be in the movie actually make the movie for him.I know some folks have said the stage actors were too old. I think that's probably right, but at the same time I respect the choice to retain most of the original cast. It shows a sentimentality that is too often lacking in the Hollywood plastic world that exists today.There is one point where Pascal tells Rosario Dawson that she looks like she's 16--no she doesn't--but she could pass for 19 MAYBE. Luckily they got a new chick to play this part. The music was AWESOME. The new addition, Rosario Dawson, was the best part probably followed by the singing voice of Adam Pascal whose voice is amazing. If he toned down the Broadway a bit (which he needed to have for Rent) he could be a real rock star, in my opinion. That being said, the dude can't act on screen. I'm sure his acting works for him on stage b/c increased theatrics are appropriate there but when you can really see what he's doing it's not great. The message is cool and the story is historical. For this reason I would encourage people to watch it.HOWEVER, I would tell people that they are going to just have to ignore the very awkward scene changes & other CRAP that Chris Columbus & his screen writer did to this work as they tried and failed to adapt it to the silver screen. It wasn't ever going to be easy to turn this into a movie, and he pretty much failed except for a few choice moments.Little scenes like after the riot where they are standing outside of the Live Cafe and basically talking through the transition were awful. I was embarrassed for the actors and the director at that point. It sounds nit picky, but recurring structural issues like this make the movie hard to watch. Columbus could have done so much more with what he was given when it came to the big numbers, too. The only songs I think he really brought to life were ""Out Tonight"" (the absolute highlight) & ""Glory"" though I was disappointed that he didn't show that April didn't just die of Aids. I thought that was important to the story of Roger. He did okay with ""Would You Light My Candle"" and ""La Vie Boehme"" but then totally dropped the ball with Angel's big number--poor Wilson did the best he could do with the shots he was given--and really really dropped the ball with ""I'll Cover You."" The Alexi scene looked random the way he presented it.The commitment ceremony--that was corny and it was put in there to try and present the Joane & Maureen's anti love song, but you could tell that was what it was for which is why the commitment ceremony fell flat. I really do like that song from the play. WHY WHY WHY do we have to watch that from underneath their armpits??? It's not a cool shot Chris, it's really not. Make your actors look good for heaven's sake! That's part of your Job! I encourage movie watchers to get--maybe rent--the DVD and watch Rosario's deleted scene ""Goodbye Love."" He REALLY should have left that in b/c Rosario did a good job performing it, and he did a good job getting it on film. But no, he just HAD to cut that out--dumb. Instead he left in a bunch of really crummy transition scenes and songs with weak weak weak cinematography that just...uck.I AM a fan of the play. I was looking forward to seeing what a film maker could do with this, and I was really disappointed.That said, I did buy the DVD b/c the scenes that are good, to me, are quite good. For others who don't want to buy the DVD, maybe buying the CD would be better b/c the singing is the best part.",Rent

I have never done one of these movie feedbacks before, but I loved it so much that I felt compelled to do it. I also am going out to buy the DVD and soundtrack tomorrow because it was so great. I cried several times throughout the movie as well as laughed out loud at other parts. It definitely deserved whatever awards that it has won so far. I plan on going online to see when the play might be coming to Phoenix so I can see it live. I also was glad to see that they kept most of the same actors from the play for the movie.

399,pinkpoodle764,Amazing movie. Life-changing.,10,2 April 2009,"I first saw Rent last weekend, and it has been constantly on my mind ever since. With songs with messages like, ""Forget regret, or life is yours to miss,"" this musical easily changed my outlook on life itself. The music is extremely catchy, and some songs are so emotional they could make me cry just listening to them (like Finale B), while others are so fun you can't stop singing them (La Vie Boheme & Rent). The characters are all so easy to love, and most of them are easy to identify with. I saw a little of myself within each character.Wilson Jermaine Heredia was fantastic as Angel. Angel was quite possibly my favorite character - I found myself laughing with her and crying over her in the end. Rosario Dawson also did an amazing job, and her voice was so pure. Anthony Rapp was awesome, I can't think of anyone who would make a better Mark. His voice was great for the role, especially with the raw side of it. It wasn't perfect, and it didn't sound like a typical ""Broadway"" voice, so I loved it. Adam Pascal is maybe even my new favorite actor, he was amazing as Roger. Jesse L. Martin was also great - I'd always been a fan of his on Law & Order, but I loved him as Collins, and I think it's very cool that he was the first to ever play that role on Broadway. Idina Menzel (Maureen) & Tracie Thoms (Joanne) were also great, their voices never ceased to amaze me. I found Maureen's performance (Over the Moon) particularly funny. I enjoyed Taye Diggs's performance, but I couldn't help but hate him - after all, he was the ""bad guy"".This movie is fantastic. I suggest it to everyone. It made me laugh. It made me cry.

The DVD is brilliant with deleted scenes and musical performances, my favorite being the alternate ending. I now own the DVD, the soundtrack, and I am officially a self-proclaimed RENTHEAD! Roger has an amazing voice, and Mark is so cool. He appears so normal, but he's really far from it (whatever normal is.)

402,donutbro,Please see this and prove me wrong,5,27 January 2014,"Rent is about to turn into a rant. First off I realize the power of the realism the creator of this went through and that made me want to love it that much more but what I thought the musical was about was a group of free spirits living in a tight knit community where love and creativity flows as quickly as the problems. Then all the sudden they are unable to make this months RENT! The greedy money grubbing landlord wants to evict these rent controlled hippies so he can convert this area into condos and make a killing. How oh how will they scrounge together the couple hundred dollars to keep the music going? Then the movie starts with them not paying this YEARS rent, after not paying last YEARS rent, and NOT planning on paying next YEARS rent... this took a lot of power out of us viewers finding out that the landlord turned off the power on Xmas. I was astonished!!! He was eating the rent AND paying for utilities for at least two years!!! In New York?!?! My God this man must have been made of money! Past tense seeing how he could afford to keep the lights on anymore so wanting to sell a couple plots of land and possibly get some cash flow going. After all this musical does take place in this universe and this universe does need money to keep turning. So sadly they cant get something for nothing. I enjoyed some of the musical numbers and this is packed full of talent. I just really cant get behind their values. You cant get something for nothing even if someone promised that is exactly what he could give you. if the world is ran by hedonist then the world would be filled with love and music and art for one generation. Then someone needs to provide for these adult children. Parents die, the cash cow cant give milk forever. I really want to be all for love and art, but when it comes time to build their Utopia no one was willing to work for it. Which is fitting for their values. If you want to build a better society you need to be willing to work at it so your children or maybe even your grandchildren can have it. This movie makes me feel bad for working to make the world better for my daughter. I wish it was as easy as saying ""I'm going to quit paying for things because the world owes it to her children to take it easy"" I really wish that was the way of things but that's why the story is awful.

The cast is so talented the film is spectacular already, but the direction makes it even better. The cast is absolutely superb. I cannot imagine anyone suited better for these parts. The music and singing are beyond words. Menzel as Maureen is absolutely perfect. Her song ""Take Me or Leave Me"" is sung so amazingly well that I can't believe I had never heard her name before. Rosario Dawson as Mimi is also incredible. I had heard she doesn't even begin to match up to Daphne, the show Mimi, but I can't imagine how she could be better. She portrays the stripper-in-love character amazingly. In addition to all this, Rent is touching beyond words. You just fall in love with each of the characters.

Bad language, sexuality, and drug use were certainly pervasive enough to warrant it. Additionally, I was disappointed at how positively the movie portrays homosexuality, stripping, cross-dressing, and revolt against traditional values. Because of my position on these issues, I found numerous scenes (ex: men kissing men, women kissing women) almost unbearable. With that said, the movie did address the effects of promiscuity and/or drugs by showing the impact AIDS had on many of the characters' lives. In that sense, the movie certainly did not positively portray their lifestyles.Conclusion: It's impossible to hate the movie because the music is so good.

I had not read reviews, plot summary, nothing. I only knew a few songs. When it first opened I was confused but if you continue watching you see the depth each character has. But not only is the plot well thought out, but Jonathan Larson puts such a big element of reality into the story, instead of fantasy. He builds a family of impoverished artists in NYC accurately. They are broke, can't pay rent, and are failing at finding sustainable livings. He shows the dynamic between the powerful and poor in a no nonsense manner. He also shows how AIDS affects so many people, and that people of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, live with. Jonathan Larson is known for being such a forward thinker, he wanted to portray NY and America as is with little to no filters, and I believe he succeeded.
The movie itself pulls at each persons heart strings whether it be from sadness or its beautiful message, there is a tune for everyone to bop to, and it leaves the message that family is unbreakable. Not the family you are born to but the family that you choose. Life won't pick you back up, but your true family will.",Rent

Not worrying about their future is how they got AIDS in the first place and just shows that they learned nothing from getting it.In addition, although the story may be looked at from the point of view of the ""artists,"" and it seems as though it is an honorable thing to live in filth and poverty to express themselves, the truth is that they are dumping their problems in Benny's hands by not paying the rent. He is looking to succeed but everyone who is not paying their rent is just holding him back. It is an honorable thing to be an artist or any career that allows you to express yourself however you need to work for it first instead of dumping your problems in other people's laps.Also, I saw the Broadway show and it was much better than the movie.",Rent

The end was the only part i had a problem with. she almost dies so what does she do? Wake up and start singing. Oh well, it was a great and creative movie, i just wish i had seen the play. DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING BOTH DVD AND SOUNDTRACK. It was voted ""Must see movie of the year"" for 2005 for a reason! All the characters were real-acting, i know many people who are like the people in this movie. I didn't think it was as over-done as most movies today are and you can tell that half of it Wasn't done on a computer, which is rare today. Al the songs are FANTASTIC and the dancing was amazingly done.",Rent
414,saby_hk,absolutely amazing!,10,13 July 2006,"I bet nobody expected people all the way out here in Hong Kong to have even heard of RENT before. well we have, and we LOVE IT! The musical came to HK a couple of months back, but it wasn't the original cast :( I didn't get a chance to see it, but one of my friends introduced me to the movie version and I've watched it every single day since I bought it and listened to the songs every single day on my iPod - I'm obsessed! I'm a huge fan of musicals, having been in loads myself (my dream is to be on Broadway hehe), but RENT has to be my favourite so far. I really wish that the movie cast would come to Hong Kong though! That would be awesome. I read on the RENT website that Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson have read the IMDb website, looking at comments and stuff, so hopefully you can read my comment here too, cos I have no idea how to put a comment up on the RENT site lol. I just have to say that Tracie Thoms is AMAZING. since the movie was my first experience of RENT, to me, Tracie will always be the one and only Joanne. as a RENThead who got where she wanted to be, you truly are an inspiration to someone like me who wants to follow in your footsteps. Secretly, I'd love to play Joanne. Sure, it would be really weird at first to play a lesbian, but the songs she gets to sing are amazing and Tracie made the part look great.

I decided to see the movie simply for the fact that I have been in love with the soundtrack since 1999, when I was in High School and heard ""Seasons of Love"" for the first time. This movie is one of those life-changing things... it makes you think about your life, and it actually even answers some questions. It has its funny moments, and has its heartwarming moments. I can't believe it took me so long to see this, please don't wait to see it. Even if you never watch it again, Just see it once. It will still make you think about how the world is (and was in the time that it's set in), and how we all need to take care of each other, and be gentle with our families and friends.This is definitely one I'm purchasing for my Home Library.

I want to preform in life when i have the chance and if i get to see Rent on Broadway! That's something to do before I die because it means so much. Many people who i have to talked to who saw this movie says it was gay and everything but... they don't understand the movie like I did and everyone else who loved it like me!

419,nwnapolitano,a great musical film,8,1 August 2006,"I walked into the theater with high expectations for this film: I owned the Original Broadway Cast Album and knew just about every word, and I also owned the soundtrack to the film. I absolutely loved the music, as well as the story, the characters, and the very positive message. Before I get on with the actual review, I will say that just because you hear that the play is tons better than the movie, that doesn't mean that the movie is bad. I've seen the play which is indeed better than the movie, but nothing can beat the energy and passion of the live show. Plus the stage and film are two different mediums, so keep that in mind when you are viewing the film. Anyway, as soon as the lights went down and my friends and i sat through all the previews, the opening musical number ""Seasons of Love"" started. From that scene I was immediately hooked on the movie. It is definitely full of fun musical numbers such as ""Today 4 U"" and ""Over The Moon"", kick-ass Rock N'Roll numbers such as ""Rent"" and ""Out Tonight"", and tear-jerking rock ballads such as the reprise of ""I'll Cover You"" and ""Your Eyes"". The actors, 6 of which are reprising the roles they created on Broadway in 1996 when RENT debuted, all did a fantastic job with their roles. The standout for me was Rosario Dawson as Mimi, the HIV positive, heroin addicted dancer at the Catscratch Club. I felt she got a lot of unfair criticism since her Mimi isn't bitchy and fierce like Daphne Rubin-Vega's Mimi was, but Dawson's sweeter, slightly more innocent Mimi is a whole new side of the character that I easily welcomed. I can't really complain about any of the actors, actually. I will admit that there some moments that are a bit too hokey and cheesy, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it in my opinion. There is one subplot that I didn't think was totally necessary, though I suppose it works just fine. About the last 30-40 minutes or so of the film are very heavy and emotional, and by the time the credits started my face was drenched with tears and I was emotionally spent. Rent certainly does take you on quite a roller-coaster ride of emotions, and by the time it's over you'll want to stand in line to take the ride over and over again.",Rent
420,LawyersAREGOOD,Self-Absorbed Geeks Attack New York. Run For Cover!,1,13 December 2006,"As someone who suffered through the Broadway musical on which this horror is based, I must admit that the movie version is every bit as embarrassing as the play. This movie is recommended for brooding, drama queens and girls who have not yet hit puberty. Still, if you enjoyed the play ""Mame"" and like watching narcissistic nerds polluting New York with song and dance, then this movie is for you. The premise of the flick is that one of the characters runs around town filming the lives of those around him with a movie camera. Wow. Idina Menzel is horribly miscast as a sexy siren. Rosario Dawson dances at a nude club in which there is no nudity. And the characters prance about the Big Apple inflicting painful songs upon all the poor citizens who get in their way.

422,crgibs01,A wonderful musical performance that paid off...,9,13 August 2006,"...No pun intended.I have to warn you; If you;re a big fan of glitzy, glamorous Broadway productions like Chicago, South Pacific, Oklahoma, and the like, you probably won't like this movie.If you wanted this to be a carbon copy of the stage musical put on the silver screen, you will not like this movie.RENT, shot by Christopher Columbus with a fantastic screenplay written by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the excellent, almost quintessential growing-up teen angst novel, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", was not meant to be the Broadway musical put on a screen. Columbus wanted to shoot this like an actual movie, which means he skimped on the obnoxious, over-the-top choreography like you see in Chicago, avoided going from the original scene in each song to a highly-decorated and lit stage, complete with outrageous costumes and background dancers(with the exception of Tango: Maureen), and wanted to keep this looking like an actual movie, shot in early 1990s New York City.The theme of this movie: No Day but Today. We have characters battling with identity crises, AIDS, poverty, a lack of inspiration, a need for affection, and of course, greed. An overly-done glamorous, loud, colorful, surreal background just isn't RENT's style. Most musicals are made to be flashy and gaudy, but RENT strays from the norm by portraying ordinary characters in an ordinary setting, dealing with everyday problematic circumstances like the rest of us.While some songs were cut(some rather good ones, I might add. I saw the play on Broadway, and while it wasn't the original cast, there were about 6 or more songs that I clearly remember being cut from the movie), the songs hey did include were beautifully done, such as Seasons of Love, La Vie Bohemme, Tango: Maureen, Out Tonight, Santa Fe, Will I(my personal favorite), and Take Me Or Leave Me.I don;t understand the negative comments about the original cats being too old for the movie's singing. They still hit all of their notes, sing some incredibly difficult pitches, and hold out for longer than I can, and I'm a 19-year-old theatre minor. Mark's intentional abrasiveness with his syllables, I think, adds an extra edge to some of his feature songs, namely Tango: Maureen. Collins has such a beautiful baritone in Santa Fe, and he harmonizes so well with the rest of the cast, who can also sing great supporting parts. Joanne really shines in her solo in the first rendition of Seasons Of Love, which is the opening scene of the movie. Rosario Dawson makes a great Mimi, and although she wasn't in the original cast, she definitely holds her own. She really shows off her attitude and sexiness in Out Tonight. And, of course, Idina Menzel absolutely blows away the rest of the cast with her singing abilities. While her skill doesn't shine through as prominently as it does in Wicked, her range and projection continue to astound me.Roger is a bit Bon Jovi/Scott Stappish, and while One Song Glory really showcases the finer pats of his voice, he is by far the least impressive of the rest of the cast. The acting in this movie is good, but not great. Acting is second to singing in Musicals, however, and out of the 100 minutes or so of this movie, a good 3/4ths of it is singing, so the acting is forgivable in this case.RENT is a great musical, and while it is different from your conventional Broadway production, it is still a must-see for anyone who loves the genre. Give this one a chance, and remember: ALL critics love to bash musicals when they come to film. Especially the unconventional ones. Don't listen to them.",Rent
423,jasmynwind2,A touching reminder that life is too short & there is no place for prejudice in this world,10,27 August 2006,"I saw the play ""Rent"" when it came to Los Angeles and loved it. When I saw they'd made a movie out of it I was, to say the least - skeptical, especially since most musicals made into movies over the years have been, to say the least, uninspired. I was truly moved by this adaptation of the play and was awed by the directing, film work and especially the talent displayed by actors not normally known for their singing and dancing ability. This was a truly enjoyable movie that since I first saw it in June 2006, have seen it 5 times. If you have an open mind to the content and aren't critical against musicals as a whole, I believe you will enjoy this beautiful piece of art.",Rent

Call me crazy, but I showed this to my parents, who are extremely narrow-minded (and hate anything ""not normal"") and even they liked it. This is a movie I have gotten all my friends addicted to, as well as my cousins! Everyone can relate to at least one of the characters in someway.

It's only saving grace Is the actors, who understandably still work well together after all those years, even newcomers Rosario Dawson and whoever plays Joanne fit in nicely.

426,eurardroode,Rent,10,28 October 2006,"Well, I have only this to say. Prepare yourself for a mixed feeling emotional roller-coaster ride. The movie starts off with one of the best intro songs I have heard ever! (I've seen some movies let me tell you) Then it takes a laid back seat and let's you get comfortable with the style it's set in. Lot's off songs tell the story well and the cast does a really great job. The one man performance midway through the movie was so spot on Broadway it's amazing and I felt as if I was watching right there in front of the stage. Then the movie hits you hard with lot's to deal with ,issues of real life, heart-ships and sadness, happiness and friendship all rolled into a tight snowball. BUT then the snowball finishes it's roll with a bang and pieces gets torn out of the story (or was that my heart). WoW I am a big man and like fast cars and bikes loud rock and never thought I will be pulling a tissue closer for this movie.

427,Normal_insanity,My thoughts,10,3 November 2006,"This movie is by no means as good as the original Broadway version is but it does have it's own specialness. I have seen this movie many, many times and will never get enough of it. The cast is terrific, the music is amazing and the overall story of friendship and hardship is spectacular. The only downside is that ""Halloween"" was cut out of the movie but I'm sure Chris Columbus had his reasons for not including it. I do wonder though why Rosario Dawson got into the movie...she was superb but you can't replace the eight original cast members. Other than that Adam Pascal will always be my favorite and no one else comes close to him. I've met all eight originals and totally love how well they all get along. Idina Menzel is the most amazing woman I have ever met, and her hubby Taye isn't too bad either! I only wish that Daphne Rubin-Vega and Fredi Walker hadn't dropped out of the movie version, but I can understand why they did (afraid that they were too old).",Rent
428,arbolton,Crying for All the Wrong Reasons!!!,3,29 November 2005,"First of all, I should say I think the stage version of Rent is musical and literary genius. I know every song by heart, and every time I see the musical, the story breaks my heart--in a good way. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I regrettably have come to the conclusion that Rent the Movie is mostly one big steaming pile of caca. It's not the performances that suckthe cast exudes talent and skill. It's the direction and the screenplay that broke my heart, for all the wrong reasons, of course. I've run over it in my head a thousand times, and can't put my finger on exactly what was wrong with the movie, but here are some maybes: a) The cast members are now too old to play the parts. b) The transitions between spoken dialogue and song are unnatural and cringe-worthy. It was like, ""let's introduce this number by speaking the lyrics as they were written, and then let's break into song!"" The transitions especially made the film feel amateurish. c) I've read in many places that the subject matter feels dated...and in some ways it does. It's not that the issues aren't still relevantI just think certain things could have been tweaked to bring the way they're portrayed up to speed. Either that, or they should have been made to feel more dated, and the time and setting should have been spelled out for the audience. (Then, for instance, maybe Angel's death wouldn't have seemed so sudden to people who hadn't seen the musical.) The only positive thing I think came out of this movie is the fire scene in the beginning (during the song Rent). WOW--wish they could do that on stage! I also enjoyed seeing Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms in the production for the first time. As a whole, I'm truly disappointed in the movie because now the American public is going to think this is what Rent is all aboutand it's not. Folks, if you haven't seen the stage version, with its live on-stage band and rabid fans and indescribable energy, you ain't seen nothing yet! Book your ticket to NYC now.",Rent

430,Renthead10,"RENT- darling, it's everything!",10,15 December 2006,"RENT is about the lives of eight very different bohemians living the the lower East side of Manhattan, in 1989, and the struggles, and successes the faces in one tumultuous year. With characters like a free-spirited s&m dancer, reclusive musician, lovable drag queen, self-centered performance artist, kind NYU professor, solitary film maker, frustrated in love lawyer and a ""yuppie"" landlord, there is someone for everyone to identify with.Based on the 1996 Broadway show, this movie captures the excitement of the live stage show down at the Nederlander perfectly.Very little movies touch me in a way that this movie did. This movie is spectacular in its technical ways(great lighting,sound and scenery). It also has an enjoyable script that is a great summary of the already fantastic Broadway show. The actors and actresses are also a delightful treat. 6 out of 8 of the main movie characters, are reprising their roles, which they played in the original stage version. All of these actors and actresses from the original cast just slip back into their characters and are just as good or better than the were 9 years ago. The 2 newcomers, Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, are wonderful editions to the cast(especially Thoms), and play their roles at great heights. They played them in a way sure to not upset any RENThead. But beyond these things that just make a movie nice to watch, RENT gives something more. It gives heart. It gives compassion. It gives humor. This movie reaches out and touches you in a way most movies can't. It pulls you in,from wherever that may , and makes you feel. This movie teaches you about love, loving others,and loving yourself. This movie teaches you that you have to work your way to the top, you cause your own success, people will be there to ""cover you"", but work your hardest. It tells you that you aren't alone, no matter how alone you may feel. This movie gets the viewer to have fun, laugh a lot, and just take everything as it is. RENT taught me there is no day but today, so i better start living. Most Movies get you to think, but RENT makes you not only think about yourself, but others as well.This movie has a great story, and it also has great music. With toe-tappers like ""Today 4 U"" and ""What You Own"" (among others). I actually got up and started dancing along with Anthony Rapp during ""La Vie Boheme"" which caused me to get many glares and ""move out of the way""s! If the movie itself doesn't grab you (impossible). The SUPERB score will. You just can't help it.I really could use up more than my maximum of 1,000 words describing how excellent the movie is, but I won't.

I didn't have any such difficulties when I saw an advance screening of the film version last night. You really understand, for example, that the film takes place over the course of a single year in the lives of these characters. And you really get to see inside the characters' lives and minds. The music is simply awesome, too--it sounds so much richer and fuller than I remember from the stage version of the show. And big, big, big props to Tracie Thoms--she has such a powerful, hypnotic, downright sirenesque voice, and she nails her numbers from the very beginning. She shines in ""Seasons of Love,"" and her duet wit Idina Menzel, ""Take Me or Leave Me,"" left me breathless. And I also want to acknowledge Jesse Martin--his voice is stellar, too--I remember him from his roles on Ally McBeal and Law & Order, but I didn't know that he could sing. But can he ever sing.

You love every character and feel like you know them and know where they're coming from. You laugh, you cry, you go through a whole range of emotions! I was so sad when Angel died. I cried from her funeral until the end. My favorite song would have to be I'll Cover You. I really wish there were relationships like Angel and Collin's today. They were so in love. So sad... The song Today For You was really good too, with a great beat. You can't help but fall in love with it, and then it's in your head for a month. La Vie Boheme is such an upbeat song! It's definitely my second favorite. Other than some suggestive lyrics that might not be too great for the kids, it's a great song to listen to if you're down in the dumps and need uplifting.

442,SedgeforRENT,The Cast Makes 'Rent' Worth the Price,10,23 November 2005,"To preface my review of Rent, I feel obligated to give a brief history of my background with the show. I've seen the stage show more than ten times, traveled more than 500 miles to see it (on more than one occasion) and camped out in the freezing ass cold to get front row ""rush"" tickets many of those times. I have all the words memorized, I know the costumes, and I am intimately familiar with the story.That said, I thought this movie was really quite good. It was wonderful seeing the faces and expressions of the performers that were, up until now, only voices on love-worn CD for me. Every character performed their ass off, not only in the musical numbers but in the spoken word scenes as well. That includes new cast additions Rosario Dawson (Mimi) and Tracie Thoms (Joanne) who both fit into the ensemble as though they'd originated their roles. My personal favorites, however, were Jesse L. Martin as the heartful Tom Collins and Wilson Jermaine Heredia as the plastic bucket-beating Angel, a drag queen with a penchant for bringing people together. These two not only sing well, but their performances are so natural and heartbreaking that I scarcely remember the other actors I've seen perform the roles live.It was truly a joy to watch all these people who have such passion for the show enact what was before a two dimensional stage production in the glorious 3-D world of the silver screen, giving new body and life to the story as a whole. Several of the musical numbers, including the show-stopping ""Rent"" and the wickedly entertaining ""Tango Maureen"" were performed with such artful gusto that you barely recognize the movie as being the work of Chris Columbus, the same kid-friendly director who turned Robin Williams into a bore in Bicentennial Man and leeched the magic out of the first two installments of the Harry Potter franchise.Unfortunately, many of scenes suffered from Columbus's lazy camera lens. Perhaps an attempt at poignancy, lingering shots made ""I'll Cover You Reprise"" and ""Your Eyes,"" two of the most gripping songs in the whole show, almost boring to sit through. Even the happy- go-lucky love song ""I'll Cover You"" was made awkward by a fairly drab dramatic lens. While the songs and performances make your heart soar, the camera often leaves your feet anchored firmly to the ground. Similarly, there are some scenes too pretentious to bear. In one instance, we see Roger (Adam Pascal) driving with the top down through the dusty deserts of New Mexico, wind blowing through his liberated mane as he and Mark's pop-rocky duet ""What You Own"" plays wistfully in the background. What doesn't translate in the scene is Roger's torment at having just fled perhaps the last great love of his life... instead it feels like you're watching a scene out of a Hallmark Channel movie.The pacing seems a bit off throughout the whole production, and although it might have been due to the fact that I saw it in a theater half-full of people who might as well have been dead in their chairs, I'd probably attribute it to the fact that there are actually breaks between songs (the stage version was a rock opera with very few spoken lines.) Frankly, though, there's a payoff to not having everything sung: the true brilliance of Jonathan Larson's original words is made even apparent... they actually sound like things people would say to one another rather than song lyrics. Still, the energy and momentum lost by not filming it as an all-singing show should have been made up with interesting and energetic cinematography, something a better director could have achieved (see Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge!). As it is, some of the film's more dramatic scenes fall flat for lack of energy.In the end, while some of the grit and raw energy of the original stage show might have gone out the window, the passion in this story of a family of mismatched East Villagers struggling to truly live remains in tact through the marvelous performances of each and every member of the cast. And while the choice in director might have been regrettable, it seems a fitting tribute to forget the regret of what what might have been and enjoy the show we've been given. It's an experience that, as with its live predecessor, bares repeating.",Rent

I still got chills, I still left the theater with a sadness that I'd have to wait to see it again, like I always did when I went to see the stage production. There is definitely something lost in translation, however, and I feel like if you haven't seen the stage production you're cheating yourself from a genuinely potential, life changing experience. Songs that were cut were missed (Goodbye Love, which is on the soundtrack) scenes that were changed seemed odd and out of place (Take me or Leave me performed at Maureen and Joanne's commitment ceremony) and then there is always the infamous ""What You Own"" sequence that I now use a fellow movie goers term to describe it: Hi, Bon Jovi called, he wants his ""Livin' On A Prayer"" video back.. Cinematically, however, the use of camera angles, and close-ups captured emotions and quirks that you could never get from the stage as well as the flashbacks and the montages which were so well done. While the grit is not a gritty, I think the director went beyond expectation for a person coming from Home Alone and Harry Potter success.",Rent

447,p1nkg0dess,Unfortunate,4,23 February 2006,"The first thing I find unfortunate, was that the movie became an homage to MTV of the 80s, which the play was far from. The second thing is that so many people have commented on the movie based on a dislike of musicals in general, or the musical rent. That has little to do with the movie, considering you knew it was an adaptation to begin with. Others think it's great because it ""deals with issues"". My critique of the movie comes from being a fan of the play and experiencing much disappointment after seeing the movie because it was a poor adaptation of a good play and took out the parts of the play that actually addressed the issues as opposed to just displaying them.I was immediately appalled that it was set in 89. The only reason I could see for this was so the costume crew could dress everyone in hideous clothes. The plot suddenly did not make much sense-why were they singing about the end of the millennium? and, as one other commenter wrote, referencing pop culture that had yet to occur (Thelma and Louise, or a cyber arts studio?), I find it very suspect that a high society engagement party for a same sex couple would be as accepted in the late 80s, and I doubt there would have been so many conservative looking women at a support group at that time, as AIDS was barely recognized as a disease affecting intravenous drug users, let alone non-drug using women. The musical numbers were good and well shot, but a few of the songs had different lines, which I assume were written in, and which did not fit with the energy and harmonies of the originals. The dialogue was lacking. The lines they used from songs did not hold up as rhyming spoken word. The lines that were written in were flat and uninspired. This led to characters being way underdeveloped, as though we would just ""know who they were"" because we've seen the musical. I was annoyed, too, how they edited Roger and April's storyline, avoiding one of the main issues of the depression associated with an HIV+ diagnosis.The last thing I felt was incredibly unfortunate was that the movie was fit into a more heteronormative patriarchal consumeristic box than the play, which honestly for me was the worst ""change"" that could have been made. By taking out the song ""Contact"", there was no mention of condoms or protection in the entire movie, whereas the play has a strong message for using protection. Collins at one point calls Mark whipped, something I certainly do not remember from the play and thought was highly offensive in the movie and deviating from the whole idea of breaking out of conservative and restrictive societal norms for relationships. They highly feminize Angel compared to the play for scenes where Collins is in love, as though it's OK for him to love Angel Only if he's seeing Angel as feminine, which doesn't go against heternormativity as heavily as if he was in love with a more androgynous or masculine Angel. Maureen's performance was the worst for selling out to commercialism in the movie, though I also agree with another commenter that Mark's ""documentary"" is a pointless montage of his friends faces reminiscent of college party pictures.The acting was good, the singing was good, the choreography and cinematography were decent, but everything else left much to be desired.I recommend that people who are interested see this movie and form their own opinions. If you didn't like the musical Rent, or musicals in general, don't bother seeing the movie, because it is an adaptation of the plot of, including songs from, the musical Rent. If you have never seen the musical, you might want to read the box before renting it, as you would any other movie (I hope).",Rent

The movie showed what true love is like, and what real friendship is all about. You could feel the emotions come at you and feel them along with the characters. At the end of the movie, I wished that they were real people so that I could find them and make them my friends. If you want to see a beautiful movie, go see Rent as soon as possible. Before you go, however, keep in mind that it is a musical, and there is a lot of singing in it. Once you get used to that idea, you will definitely enjoy what you see.

452,craigoulton,Jonathan Larson Gives Us Hope!,10,6 April 2010,"""Rent"" is the story of one year in the lives of eight friends living in New York's East Village in the late 1980's. Set amidst the harrowing specter of illness, poverty, drug addiction and the AIDS epidemic, and with the plot swirling around the horrors of death and despair, one would think that the lives of these struggling artisans would be a movie totally filled with darkness, misery and anguish. Not so! Teeming with an abundance of friendship, caring and understanding, this film is a celebration of compassion, dignity and love! ""Rent"" is a challenge to our comfortable little worlds – Jonathan Larson has given us a statement we simply cannot ignore! This movie is the 2005 film version of Jonathan Larson's theatrical production ""Rent,"" which is one of the longest running creations on Broadway and the 1996 Winner of every major award in the categories of ""Best Musical,"" ""Best Book,"" ""Best Score,"" ""Best Lyrics"" and the 1996 Pulitzer Prize recipient for ""Best American Drama."" ""Rent"" is now known as ""The Rock Opera of the 90's."" What makes this screen production extraordinarily unique is that, of the eight original stage actors, six of these gifted thespians portray their stage characters in this astonishing motion picture. ""Rent"" is clearly one of the most emotionally beautiful, creative and yet socially challenging movies ever produced.The truly beautiful aspect of this movie lies in the theatrical songs throughout the film, each one filled with lyrics of the heart and soul – ""Rent,"" ""One Song Glory,"" ""Light My Candle,"" ""Life Support,"" ""Tango Maureen,"" ""I Should Tell You,"" ""La Vie Boheme"" and ""Without You,"" just to name a few! Jonathan Larson was given the world a musical gift of love, compassion and hope beyond description! If you like drama, and theater, and music, this is a movie you will love! And if you find yourself culturally troubled, and are close-minded and phobic, this film could clearly be of help! Jonathan Larson has furthered my distance down the roadway of understanding and unconditional love! Thank you Jonathan Larson!",Rent
453,smileyfaces1993,This was a pretty good movie. I consider for people to watch if you haven't already.,8,14 May 2010,"The movie rent i have watched is based on my topic HIV and AIDS. Rent was like a musical with singing and parts with just acting in it. There is an actual reason why it's named Rent, which is because, the characters in the movie are struggling to pay their rent and many other people around the one spot in New York City. This movie does deal with my topic of HIV and AIDS because the characters do have HIV and AIDS which they want people to fight so it does not spread.In the movie Rent, there are strengths and weaknesses but not too many. In the film, the music is actually based on their lives in the movie, not just singing to be singing, it has a real meaning to it. The movie also sings to fight the disease HIV and AIDS. If you are willing to watch the movie, there is one saying in the movie which is La Vie Bo heme which you may not know what it means and it means a bohemian life. A bohemian life in a lifestyle of a person or people with talent. Rent also has scenes with fighting, dealing with drugs, and death from HIV and AIDS.My personal opinion of the movie was that it is a good movie, but i don't really like movies with a lot of singing. This movie actually wasn't that bad with the singing. I consider you do watch the movie to give an opinion of it, but to me, it was an okay movie.",Rent
454,cook-brandong,No day like today~,10,28 June 2010,"Rent is probably going to always stand out as an exceptional play; if for nothing else because of the music alone. Mr. Larson who wrote the original play, is one of the geniuses of our lifetime in my opinion. There are few people far and wide who haven't seen RENT, and even fewer who haven't heard of it.The movie does the Broadway show justice in it's portrayal of the story. The music is tastefully orchestrated; the actors all portrayed their characters to the dot; and best of all the story is left relatively UNTOUCHED. It hasn't suffered the ""Hollywood Effect"" that most major movies suffer when some director gets their greasy hands upon it. Thinking that their goal is to ""add more spice"" or finding excuses to blow any(every)thing up.In the story the most realistically laid out characters would probably be our suffering guitarist Roger, and starving artist Mark. I'll try to leave out as many spoilers as I can; (But either way you should be watching it after reading this!)the story is revolving around Roger and Mark as they both work to overcome their social and environmental obstacles. Both of them are poor at first; Roger suffering from HIV which is degenerating into AIDS, and Mark disconnecting himself from society and emotion after being toyed around with. They gain (and regain) friends to help both support them and reinforce their will to live for the moment.There were very few flaws in the music which was quite important to myself. When I was listening to their singing and the orchestrated pieces there were virtually no ""pitchy"" areas; and the technology used to balance it left very little distortion in the sound to be noted unless you were listening for it. Most importantly however, is the same songs that you heard on Broadway are now polished and are elegant beyond description! I cannot say that I've ever actually listened to music from a movie on a regular basis until I saw RENT.So enough of reading these reviews!

457,Wallaby1234,A good effort for a movie that should never have been made. (some minor spoilers),7,20 November 2005,"I had a very unique ""Rent"" experience the other night. There was a free preview at my school (NYU) that attracted an audience that was largely theater and film majors. There was a lot of buzz in the days approaching the preview, especially among the obsessed theater crowd. Naturally, expectations were high. I couldn't go a day without hearing a classmate break out into Seasons of Love or Another Day. I myself was becoming a little skeptical of the standards people were starting to put on the film. The people that have seen the live show five times (trust me, there are lots of them) were especially expectant. The night of the screening, when the lights dimmed, the whole theater broke into applause. Finally, the eagerly awaited film would be unveiled for hundreds of die hard Rent-heads.Before I get in my two-cents about the film, I just want to say that I have come to a pretty good understanding about the craft of adaptation in my time as a film student. I understand that the medium through which a story is told is highly influential of the overall structure, and that this medium will often call for a lot of re-vamping from the original. You can't get too angry at this, and if you come into the theater expecting the Rent you saw on Broadway, you will have a terrible, sad experience. It's an adaptation, people.OK. We all know its a musical, but there's something that separates Rent from, say, The Sound of Music or Grease. It's that Rent knows its a musical that was based on the stage. Everything about the film was trying to remind us of the stage. The times that didn't (for example, What You Own's incredibly overdone Sante Fe scene with Roger gazing longingly into the sunset) you become painfully aware that you are in a movie theater watching a piece that was never intended for the screen. It's really not Columbus' fault that we constantly find ourselves questioning the validity of a character transmitting his/her emotions through song, which is purely because that was what happened on stage. The movie-musical is always risky, because we must assume the suspension of disbelief for every song where every character can sing in perfect harmony to a chorus that everyone happens to know the words to. So it's not really fair to judge this movie by saying its ""cheesy"" for that reason. But what really took away from the potential of this film is its dedication to the original. Rather than try to adapt the stage version, it tried to recreate it in many ways, which made some moments flat out painful. At some point, the decision was made by Columbus and the writers and the whole production team that they would try to remain as faithful to the stage version as possible. Because of this, any moment that tried to stray from the original (like the Sante Fe scene) was really uncomfortable to watch, as we become very conscious of the film trying to be original (which really, it wasn't at all). Altogether, a valiant effort, but it was never meant to be made.The reaction of the audience afterwords was very mixed. For the die-hards, they mostly felt a little ripped off. No one I spoke to ""hated"" it, and the only one I know who ""loved"" it had hated the original Broadway musical. I don't know how that can be interpreted, but I just want those of you who are expecting Rent to be amazing to be forewarned... they did the best they could do with a movie that was never meant for the screen. There is too much going against the film from the get-go that would never have allowed it to be a great movie.",Rent

Unlike the recent movie adaptation of Chicago, the essence and brilliance of the stage production of Rent was seamlessly translated onto the silver screen.I have seen Rent performed on stage more times that I can remember, and I walked out of the movie theater affected in the same way as I was after seeing in performed on stage for the first time. There are some derivations from the original script, which will go unmentioned in this review, and some other things were added to enhance the story, but the heart of Rent is present through the entire film.I anxiously awaited the release of this film and I was not disappointed.

In the end, This film version of Rent should be studied by any director looking to bring a musical to the screen.

461,meyer659,Doesn't work on the big screen,3,6 December 2005,"Rent is a rather disturbing ""Rock-opera"" about a group of homosexual drug-using friends who reside in NYC. The story unfolds revealing their lost dreams, struggles with their land lord, and trying to stay healthy while being infecting with HIV/AIDS. The movie reveals these people's lives through scenes of singing. dancing, more singing, and more dancing. Through all the un-catchy, un-rhyming lyrics, you learn about their life without power in a run-down apartment, and their lost dreams of being musicians, and film-makers. As the film progresses it become more and more disturbing. The characters in the film are widely involved and accepting of each other's drug use, homosexual relationships, cross-dressing, and self-exposing jobs. The films attempts to make the viewer feel sympathetic for the characters, but considering their revolting way of life, how can they? The music in the movie is very continuous and uninformative considering the length of most of the songs. They're not very catchy either (Lines such as ""my T-cells are low"" really don't make the reviewer want to dance, or fit in too well with the music) the film could have used a lot more dialogue necessary to get to know the character better. All the songs and scenes of dancing made most of the film seem very repetitive due to the amount of songs, and unimportant, due to the little value the songs had on the plot. The only detail the audience learns about the characters is their passion for each other, which is the main theme of the film. The character do love each other, and that was touching, but considering their unhealthily lives, they are not great friends to each. The acceptance of their ways of lives in the film is the most bothersome part of the film. Two female characters will make-out in the film, and it's not portrayed as abnormal. One of the male characters cross-dresses and attempts to live the life of a female, dating abnormal acting man, and it comes off as ""cute,"" or just a small character trait. The only consequences the characters seem to deal with due to their lifestyles, is AIDS. That is a big problem, but the morale and mental problems caused by living their kind of life should have been included. Most films have very dark and physiological of such behavior, which is very disturbing in its own right. Rent's ease of portrayal of such behavior, is just as disturbing. It will make most viewers have the thought of, ""What is this world coming to,"" going through their heads in most parts of the film. The film is not about people with AIDS dealing and trying to get over the virus, it's about people with AIDS that very much enjoy and embrace the lifestyle in which they contracted it with. That certainly does not send a positive message to anyone watching the film. The choreography and complexity of the dance scenes are impressive, but that is one of the few positive aspects of the film. The inaccuracy of the film's portrayal of society, overuse of non-rhyming music, shallowness of characters, and predictable plot well out way anything positive about the film.Hopefully Rent does not mark the end of family oriented, clever musicals. The genre of ""Rock-opera"" does not work so well in movie format, the lack of dialogue that makes stage performances exciting, loses nearly all of it's affect on the big screen. More traditional musicals still have the element of memorable lines, and clever character, that Rent simply cannot match.",Rent
462,kitsuneduet,No Day But Today,10,15 April 2006,"RENT was fantastic. I mean, it had a great soundtrack, and Mark our sort-of protagonist was totally adorkable. All the characters except Benny were very well developed. Actually I'm surprised they didn't do more with him. His whole deal starts as the main plot then just... wanders off. I did like the sharp portrayal of AIDS- in the AZT breaks, the group and Mark's awkwardness with it, etc.::SPOILERS:: And the characters in the group fading out in the montage- dangit I'm gonna start crying again- seriously, I was crying my eyes out. And I like never cry. But I was *bawling* when Angel died. And I had already known she was going to die before hand. She was a very powerful character. And of course that cry set me up to cry at Mimi's brush with death. Actually, her miraculous recovery and Benny's wandering sideplot were the only things that kind of jarred me out of the amazing movie mode.::END SPOILERS:: But the whole movie was very powerful- it moved me a lot. I think I'm gonna hafta buy this one. And I never buy movies. Aggh, I would love to see it in theater and get the full rock-opera effect with all the songs. Though if the movie was this good the play might just freak me out. Man, it's like 'WHOAH. This is why this is so popular.' It was just- it was one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.Awesome.",Rent

As for the cast being too old, 20 somethings, thirty somethings, does it matter? The cast is great, as they were when I first saw them. Did they leave some songs out? A minor infraction. Would the people who didn't like the movie, like it if it was longer? The real star of the show is the music and on that score they hit a home run. Is the movie as good as the play? How can it be. How can you compare sitting in a Broadway theatre watching live actors to watching it on a screen. So to anybody reading these reviews, contemplating weather or not they see Rent, sit back and enjoy it. It only cost one tenth the price of the Broadway show. Take it for what it is. It's the next best thing to being there.",Rent

Can it really convey the emotions of the songs in 2-D? WOW! There was nothing to fear. In a word it is ""Cathartic."" Very little was cut and that which was made no difference. Chris Columbus out did himself by directing scenes in locations that not only fit the plot but enhanced it. The scenes of Roger in New Mexico are hauntingly beautiful and evoke more emotion from the song than I though possible. The camera angles used bring you so into the action that every song is filled with the emotion that only these veteran performers of the musical could bring to the screen. Having lived and worked in the AIDS epidemic and field the compassion shown in the movie made me long for lost friends and be thankful I was able to be there for them as they left. Go see this, be prepared to laugh, cry and leave feeling uplifted and full of life.",Rent
466,phan10495,You won't be sorry,10,23 November 2005,"Right up to the moment the lights dimmed, I had my doubts about Mr. Columbus. We knew how fantastic the OBC was, we'd heard how perfect Rosario and Tracie were, but somehow there was always the fear that, despite his keen understanding of the story and characters, Chris Columbus would find a way to make Rent hard to sit through.So now I'm wondering--what happened to the guy who directed the first two Harry Potter films? If you study Rent, you'll find that those signature sweeping shots are there, the ones that people said just wouldn't be right for the gritty East Village musical. But chances are you'll get sucked right into Rent from the get-go, and when you do stop and notice the camera soaring over the dingy rooftops, you just won't care.Yes, it's that good. Really, trust me. I haven't felt so satisfied walking out of a movie of any genre in a long, long time. And as far as recent musicals go, it shouldn't be compared--it can't be. Moulin Rouge was a novelty, Chicago was fun, Phantom was eye candy. But only Rent is truly complete. Every character is real, every loft and alleyway feels authentic, and every emotion you feel sitting in the movie theater is not forced by traditional tear-jerking elements. I dare you not to choke up during the ""Without You"" montage. But most surprising is the fact that the film's most beautiful aspect isn't the tragedy; rather, it's the joy, the energy, and the life oozing from the actors at all times.Oh yeah, the actors. Another thing--not a weak link. I was expecting most of them to be great, but not all. And it spread to the smaller roles, as well: each and every inhabitant of the world of Rent felt whole.There has to be at least one part that didn't translate well, you say. Well yes. As others have noted, for about 15 seconds we are subjected to a somewhat embarrassing shot of Roger walking amongst the picturesque rocks of New Mexico. And that's all. I promise.Not a person in the surprisingly packed theater today seemed to dislike this film--and a fresh batch was lined up already when we came out. Trust me on this one, you won't be sorry. Rent pleases and truly fulfills the public without pandering to them, and that's pretty rare in cinema these days.",Rent

The only way I have been able to experience the story is through the cast recording. When I finally got to see the movie, with most of the original cast members, I was just blown away. It is the best movie musical I have seen. The new cast members that replaced Mimi and Joanne are even better than the originals in my opinion. Rosario Dawson (Mimi) has an amazing voice, and I like it much better than Daphne-Ruben-Vega's. I also think Tracie Thoms is a lot better than the original Joanne. I can't remember the name of the original. The only thing the movie could have done better is just to have more of the original songs. Happy New Year isn't in the movie and it was a great song. Halloween is on the movie soundtrack, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't in the movie. That confused me. Anyway, this movie was awesome, and the only thing it did wrong was to be too short and cut some good songs.",Rent

And I came out thinking I was right...but that the new experience was also extremely rewarding! :) Rent is a movie musical that changed the face of Broadway. I remember being in college and hearing the soundtrack being played in every dorm room. And the most bizarre part was that most of the rooms were NOT theater majors. Go in with an open mind! Sit back, don't judge and enjoy this moving story about young people living with real issues. Sure...not all of us have Aids, work at a strip club or are a drag queen.

This film is true. Energetic, beautiful, heartbreaking, heartwarming, and true.It makes you believe in the revolution, in the bohemian ideals of the characters you learn to know and love. They are flawed, but so effortlessly I was taken beyond that and loved them in spite of their faults, their vices, even loved them more because of it.I could go on, but bottom line, this is a film you have to see. Whether you know the musical or don't, whether you love or hate Broadway, see this movie. Its as if it were a documentary of real life, but with amazing songs and dances weaved in with an elegant grace. You'll learn more about groups of people you didn't understand before, but above all, you'll learn more about yourself. No day but today.-Molly",Rent

474,jeremylmoon,Stage Fan Rediscovers RENT,10,24 November 2005,"There are several reasons to be concerned that the film version of RENT might not convey the spirit of the original Broadway stage production. The most obvious are that the audience is much broader and venue is quite different. Then again, those who developed former versions of RENT for the stage at New York Theater Workshop shared these worries when the show left for Broadway.The film version is different from its popular Broadway brother. The plot was slightly rearranged, some of the lyrics were converted and reworked into dialogue, and two important characters were recast, but its spirit is strong and true to all former renderings.Film director Chris Columbus used several tools to clarify subtle plot pieces that flashed by in a fraction of a second on stage, and at some points not only took cast members out of their apartments, but even out of the street. I held my breath at two points in particular while watching the film, fearing that changes might take the audience away from the central themes. That never happened.Although I am was familiar with previous versions of the show, I not only enjoyed, but learned quite a bit from this version of RENT. It made me laugh, cry, and think about love and life in ways that stage versions never did.",Rent

I would have to say, it lived up to what I was expecting. I mean, I'm going to have my certain reservations, because as a huge fan, I have my own visions of what I had wanted to see on screen. However, I feel that Chris Columbus did a good job in capturing the essence of what RENT should be. It had the same feel of the B-way show and the original cast has still got it. Also, seeing it on screen also made the story so much clearer to me. Columbus made great use of the camera. The shots just seemed to flow through the streets of Alphabet City, much like a music video. The film opens w/ ""Seasons of Love"", but it really begins to pick up when the cast starts singing ""Rent."" The energy was so high and fast paced, that it makes you want to get up and sing along (I had to restrain myself.)It was wonderful to watch. I highly recommend it!!

477,ldrucker-1,"New york artists struggle with poverty, drug addiction, and disease, to the beautiful songs of Jonathon Larson",10,4 December 2005,"This is the film for people who loved RENT the show, but weren't obsessed with it. Major ""rent-heads"" will simply judge it too harshly, as a friend of mine did, leaving the theater in the middle of the movie. Rent follows a year in the life of a group of friends living in New York and struggling to get by. Taking place in 1989-90, the characters deal with film making and song writing blocks, the concept of selling out, jealousy, drug addiction, AIDS, love, death and much more. This movie is full of cheese, in the most beautiful and heart-wrenching of ways. At times it feels like a Ricky Martin music video, but the key is to separate the Broadway show from the movie in your mind, and appreciate them as different tributes to Jonathon Larson's creativity and genius. Though some songs are missing, the added back story and detail make up for it. The show was masterfully molded into movie form. The music was incredible, all the acting entertaining at the least, and the story is, of course, completely timeless. I am speaking as that rent-head who learned all the songs by heart before even going to see the show, fell completely in love with the show once I actually got to see it, and has never stopped loving it since, even when people told me it wasn't cool to like RENT anymore. I thought the movie was so much fun.

479,GloryBlaze2004,"Thank You, Jonathan Larson",10,29 October 2005,"I have been sitting on this review for a while, and I actually have not had time to come around and post my thoughts. A crew member of mine from OC scored me some advanced screening tickets through Sony Studios, which basically meant there was about thirty of us in a small theater watching RENT on the big screen.So on to the movie. To say the least, it was an incredible and moving experience. I am the most critical RENT head. I love everything about the lesson of Larson, but I was one of the most doubtful of whether or not this movie could pull through. But it did, and in fact it was one of the most incredible refreshing flicks I've seen in a while. Too often are we left with movies that we've seen too many times before. Hackneyed plots and overzealous characters. RENT is none of that. From the minute the first chord of the movie starts, you are whipped into that ""emotional and visceral sensation we all had going to our first rock concert"" as Chbosky would put it. ""So God damn happy."" No, really on to the movie. The first fifteen minutes are overwhelming. But in a good way. I'm not one to spoil, in fact I refuse to do so. But the flash backs and forwards of character motivations and livelihoods and the song ""Seasons Of Love"" accompanying it all is a great way to start the film, and by the time the actors really start acting you already feel incongruously close to them.The structure of the film is genius in itself, and is what the play version is mostover lacking. With the opening montage and character motivations, you immediately are attached to love these eight individuals. With the fun and excitement that follows through and pursues, your bonds are strengthened so much more with each of them so that when the heartbreaking conclusion does occur, you are all the more affected.Not one performance was lacking in emotion, and the choice to bring back the majority of the OBC and bring onboard Dawson and Thoms were fantastic casting decisions. To me, the standout performance of the feature was Jesse L Martin as Tom Collins. Not only is he given the biggest character dilemma to deal with, and arguably one of the most fantastic character arcs in the movie, but his acting is superb and in the event of Angel's death - you're right there with him. As emotionally wrecked as he.Rosario Dawson's portrayal as Mimi was phenomenal. The only reason Dawson failed to stand out as much as Martin is that she is obviously less 'musically inclined' than the rest of her cast. Her ""Out Tonight"" dancing, however, is hot and floored every male in the room. Dawson easily snagged her first nod buzz with this role, as supplemented by the FYC poster with only her upon it, and she very well could give any other actress a run for their money. Her spirit and her charm are almost entrancing to the audience, and when she loses it all - and essentially dies (emotionally and mentally) it leads to a more heartbreaking moment than Angel's passing.Thoms and Menzel are the other two shining jewels of the cast offering two equally stunning performances and vocal talents. Menzel does well in portraying a very flirty, ditzy (and very Jewish) Maureen - however, even though some are saying Menzel will easily land a nomination Maureen is too realistic of a character to considerably be phenomenal acting, and Menzel is really only given one scene to show the sensitive side to her frivolousness, and the acting isn't anything to write home about.The other notable performance is by Adam Pascal. Mediocre scene motivation, but incredible emotion and fantastic vocals. Pascal won't land any nomination for his portrayal, but he certainly helps Dawson carry the movie as being the other lead in the love story between the two.Diggs, Rapp and Heredia all do well in their individual role. Rapp is offered much more of a lead role than in the play, but he fails to comprehend the fact that he is in a film and doesn't have to be as 'big' as a theatrical production. Diggs is solid for his scenes, but rarely involved. And Heredia's performance is truly outstanding, and when supplemented with Martin's Collins' is heartbreaking, it's just a shame that he has absolutely no name for himself to land a nod. He certainly deserves it.All in all, RENT is a masterpiece and should be recognized as so. Despite its PG-13 rating, it is a very fierce and intense movie that really draws out the issues of homelessness, homosexuality, AIDS and bohemianism in New York in the 1990s. The screening I saw included both Halloween and Goodbye, Love (contrary to what others are saying), so whether or not the cuts were actually made, I have no clue about.Needless to say, RENT will be a blockbuster hit among all generations and is definite Oscar material and after such negative reviews of most contenders, I'd say it has a shot at the gold. The Picture, Direction and Cinematography were fantastic and the performances of Dawson and Martin may easily land them nominations. The movie doesn't feel the need to deal with the controversial subjects delicately, because they are anything but delicate subject matter - but they do handle every situation with class and that is the class that gives RENT its charm.The movie is certainly a very moving piece of art, and just as Colombus said on the OMS, I caught myself crying ""Thank You, Jonathan Larson.""",Rent

Saw it at the Nederlander in NY, the Fox in Atlanta, and the Classic Center in Athens, GA. I thought the film adaptation was an absolutely wonderful translation of a hit Broadway ""rock opera"" to the big screen. The cast was amazing, as I had no doubt they would be, and the cinematography was splendid at providing a moving background to an inherently static production. Sure the actors move around in Broadway and have scene changes with different lighting, but it was great to see snow falling and the inside of the community center, and even a reception hall for a surprise engagement party. One warning, and here's when the subject line comes in. If you haven't grown up past the age of 10 or live in the south, DON'T see this movie. I hate having to tell anyone not to see this wonderful production, but I do so almost for the sake of true fans. I saw a 10pm showing on opening night and was both shocked (although I guess I shouldn't have been considering I was in a suburb of Atlanta) and crestfallen at the crowd reaction to Angel and Collins first kiss. I mean, come on people, grow up! Are we so judgmental, sheltered, and for lack of a better word, afraid, that we can't deal with same sex affection? This is 2005!!! No way in hell do I agree with some of the relationships presented by this movie, but I'm not so arrogant as to think I can judge them for their choices. It's a story that goes beyond color, as I feel we're still trying to deal with in this day and age, or sexual orientation. Considering that I guess it's too much to ask that we be OK with same sex relationships. We've just learned to be politically correct and abstain from gay bashings or fag drags...or have we?

As the architect of one of the most daunting adaptations ever to come along, Columbus made Rent feel like it was meant to be on the screen from the very beginning, not to mention rendering some of the dated aspects of the extremely well-known show completely non-existent. Columbus breathed new life into the show and allowed the audience experience the touching messages of love, life, and friendship with the same clarity as audiences first experienced in 1996.

It was simply an amazing film and to all those who are scared away by the themes of this movie (homosexuality, HIV/AIDS, etc.) I say this: try to see past them.

484,lcarson-4,RENT movie fantastic!-opening day viewing--DVD REQUEST!!!,10,5 December 2005,"I saw RENT the first day it came out and it was fantastic! Yes, there were a couple of annoying things, but overall, I was very impressed. I was so worried that it would suck because of the reviews, but I loved it. I've seen RENT on stage at least 4 times. Annoying elements of the movie: Anytime that they SPOKE instead of sang a song. It drove me nuts! I wanted to yell at the screen: ""SING DAMN IT!!!"" The only other annoyance I found was that they left out songs. The ones that were included were great (some songs altered a bit--OK), but there should have been more songs from the stage! ALSO, Collins and Angel's first meeting--a connection on stage (in the song) was missing in the movie, though u see later on the connection and that he loves her (both of the ""I'll Cover You""s. One last annoyance, was with songs like: Without You... they did not actually SING the song. I LOVE that song and wish I could have seen them singing at least a little of it! --It was still very good, though (the end when Roger catches her on the street was very very strong!!) Gosh... it was a really beautiful movie. Every character impressed me (Taye Diggs not the best, but still cute every time he smiled at some funny occurrence going on (esp. during RENT by his car). Roger's voice sounded perfect, and Mark was perfect--I love the sharp tones when he sings (beginning of the Tango song!). Mimi's character... I don't know if I really saw her as ""Mimi,"" but her voice and acting was very impressive. Joanne and Maureen's relationship was great! ... and I LOVED their song together (then when the group follows them around the house--- so funny!) Angel was great as well.Collins and Mark were probably my favorite, taking the lead by only a little. Their voices are... completely amazing (Roger probably follows these two guys). Any song that Collins sang (I'll Cover You, esp), my eyes got a little watery. I was smiling throughout the entire movie... Living in America was GREAT! I was not sure when it started w/out seeing them sing, but the song really had it all and had so much in it! In RENT and Tango Maureen, I love the extras when the group sings together-- very powerful. Since, I saw it on the first night, the RENTHEADS were of course there. There was cheering at the beginning and end... also clapping during the first song. In the middle, across the theater, I heard a girl SOBBING. She was crying so badly. Everyone around me was sniffling or going ""awww."" ---But in this one movie, it was actually OK, because it was exactly what I was thinking or feeling. It was SO great. The other three people I went with loved it and all of my friends love it so far!! I took a 15 and 13 year old and they really loved it!! Yay!-- new Rentheads!Now I wonder what will be on the DVD. With any luck, it will be a two DVD set (the cds are two!!) with LOTS of DELETED SONGS/ SCENES!!!!! I REALLY think that the DVD should be two versions (like some are made)... with two versions of the movie... one with the theatrical version and one with ALL of the MANY DELETED SONGS included in the movie. That would be a DREAM!!! Also, I'd love to see the new song on the cd sung by the actors! Congrats to the actors in RENT!! U all met high expectations and did not disappoint at all!!! WELL DONE.... now go make more movies/ musical movies!!!..... -----(Collins, Mark, Roger, Maureen (Elphaba)??) We'd love to see you again in a movie.... soon! :DAlso, my mouth practically dropped when I heard Gordon sing his small song (in the life support group). WOW!! Who knew that guy from gilmore girls could sing like that!!!!! WOW!!! Amazing voice! WOW!!!Request to everyone: GO SEE RENT (I'll be seeing it again!)Request to whoever puts out the DVD: Make it spectacular: 2 discs, two versions of movie! (as stated above), deleted scenes/ SONGS, extended songs!! There should really be a version of RENT that is ALL SINGING throughout the entire movie. I'd be very happy with that, even though it is pretty unrealistic for them to reshoot talking into singing, but I can still hope.",Rent

The intimacy of the camera, creates 5,ooo times more connection between audience and characters. It's unbelievable how many differences there are, and how refreshing it is. the show changed my life, and the movie reminded me so much of what it did for me in the first place. if you've seen Rent on stage, see this movie...if you haven't, see this movie! the message spans across time and generations, so who cares if you're 16 or 60, black or white, straight or gay, this tells you there is no time but the present, don't regret, don't let opportunity pass you by.

After the bad reviews I read (Variety comes to mind.), I was praying that Revolution/Sony wouldn't screw this up. And they didn't.From the opening, it's clear that Columbus, although simple in his direction, knew what he was doing. The visuals and performances he received out of the crew and cast are stunning. Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal lead a stellar cast. Newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms will blow you away with talent. Dawson especially reaches a emotional peak in this movie. Wilson Heredia and Jesse L. Martin are spectacular as Angel and Collins and, although it was toned down a bit, their relationship is still fantastic. Idina Menzel shines as Maureen, and Taye Diggs helps further Benny's character.Even, if you aren't a RENThead, and never seen the musical before, go. You'll laugh, cry, love, and live through these characters. You'll leave the theater singing and you'll want to live your life for NO DAY BUT TODAY.",Rent
488,jrb4990,OH MEUH GAH! This is trash.,1,31 March 2006,"This is quite possibly the worse film I have seen in the past ten years. I am absolutely amazed how this play won the Pulitzer Prize. Someone please tell me, is the adaptation that much different? The dialog in this movie is ludicrous. It's so bad, it's hilarious. From the wonderful eulogy speeches (""It was us, BABY, WE were the lucky ones""), ""Come on guys! Don't fight now!"" (delivered with great whining annoyance by the not so brilliant actor Anthony Rapp), is cringe-worthy. The lyrics of these songs are also blatantly stupid. They contain awful metaphors and are just terrible altogether--picture Britney Spears singing the first thing that pops into her head, all day. What's worse are the technical aspects of this production. The snow looks like powdered Frosted Flakes. Does anyone believe these people are cold? The costume design is just as worse. This takes place in the nineties, not the Gap. I also don't see how Adam Pascal was cast for either the play or the film production. His voice is terrible. Get a flipping throat lozenge if you're gonna sound like your voice box is going to fly out your mouth! And lastly, Mark's ""movie"" at the end of the film is ridiculous. Did it really take him ALL year to edit a dumb music video of himself and his friends making dumb faces. It's just clips of small, short moments. That doesn't make a movie, that makes a montage...of crap.DON'T RENT ""RENT!""",Rent

This is an amazing was to procrastinate on homework. Anthony Rapp, from the OBC, reprises his role in a very fiery and determined way. Adam Pascal, also from OBC takes this role in an amazing new way, yes, I do mean the amazing long hair, and leaps into it with amazing grace. Rosario, though new to the cast fits right in! I admit that was where I was worried, bringing a larger business celebrity for the role, but she was amazing, and I got over it. Taye Diggs was incredible, need I say more? Wilson Jermain Heredia is an amazing actor, and sings so high and well that I laugh and applaud him every time. Idina Menzel, my hero, celebrity idol, whatever you want to call her, is extremely impressive, she belts everything, and struts about the stage as though she owns it, just as Maureen would. Tracie is adorable, and lovable, and an amazing singer, Congratulations to her for taking the world by storm.

They try to get you to like the movie EVEN THOUGH it's a musical. But this was made for people that love musicals. The voices were amazing. The movie easily slid over the difficulty of having great scenes AND great music. I saw Rent live and this movie threatens to match that experience. The movie made me laugh, it made me cry, and I loved every minute of it.It was so exciting to listen to people sing that I'd been listening to from Broadway. None of the actors had lost their sparks. You can see that they really belong with each other. They absolutely shine when they sing together. The new additions to the cast don't take away from that feeling, either.

494,ced_tha_chozen,Rent Was a great watch,10,31 October 2013,"As I watched rent I took notice of the fact that throughout the film the writer as well as the director made sure the audience understood the connection between renting a place and living life. Throughout the film it shows the audience how life is flailing and temporal just as renting is. The film is very interesting in its approach on showing each scenario as the plot and storyline unfolds. The director uses music in this film not just as a back drop or transitional vehicle between scenes and plot formation; but instead, it has its own identity and way of helping the story unfold. In this film music is used to help bridge the gap between several different elements within its plot, some of them are the gap between 2 socio economic groups, the gap between the reality and what's seen. At various times throughout the film, the director used prominent events to set the tone, and the music that accompanied the scene helped to the lead the audience on a visual and emotional journey with the actors in order to understand what as transpiring within the scene and plot sequence. There was one scene that really grabbed my attention within the film; it was the progression of the HIV virus and death of Angel. The were 2 things that I noticed about this particular event in the plot sequence, firstly Angel's death shows the frailty of life and that life is truly synonymous to renting in that renting is temporary and once your lease is up you must move, likewise once your ""lease"" on life is up you die. I also noted that the music that accompanied the scene was very solemn. The music throughout this film told an ongoing to story that coincided with the things that were being portrayed through the acting; I believe that music in this film was well thought out and planned well. The music was strategically placed to make sure the audience remained engaged throughout the film. Rent is a film that is timeless, it's message still speaks and it's a film that can be enjoyed over and over without any loss of interest.",Rent

He never looked like he was in love with his work, he and Roger didn't really have a fight about it. 3)Why was Collins a flaming pot head... i missed his relationship with Angel 4) no Contact.... sure its a little sexy for a movie... but Angel dies a the end of it... its a really emotional moment that leads into the reprise of I'll Cover You 5)Joanne and Maureen didn't break up during La Vie Boheme... it was such a sudden fight at their commitment ceremony 6)Roger in Santa Fe on a cliff.

There were only one or two flaws. One would be that this movie was rated PG-13 but it was a little too intense for this rating . I must say that it definitely was not a ""R"" movie at all. The cast was great and had so much energy that you forgot that they were just actors and not these characters they portray.Idina Menzel took me by surprise with her performance of Maureen , she did such a great job that I don't see her as Elphaba from Wicked anymore but as Maureen. The other actors were great too and I love that most of them were the original cast. This movie is definitely not a comedy and it is a tearjerker so bring some tissues for the end. For all of the Broadway and Musical fanatics like me you will LOVE this movie.For those who are not big Broadway fans this will probably not be the movie for you. With big music numbers and dancing you aren't going to be all that thrilled. The voices coming from these people will give you a second thought though. They can SING and I mean it!This movie points on very touchy issues. Such as HIV, Gays , drugs and much more. The point is clearly seen in this movie and you will definitely learn a lot for seeing this.Overall this movie is great and you won't go away without shedding at least one tear!",Rent

It wasn't.After Seasons of Love (the first time) I was hooked. Three minutes into it and it's already on my top five of 2005 list. So as the story unfolds my attitude gets even more excited as we meet Angel, Mimi, and JoAnn. The characters are so well cast and so well acted that it made you feel like there weren't actors, but people you were watching in a documentary.The major themes are, yes, AIDS and homelessness, but LOVE is probably the biggest theme of all. Between Mimi and Roger, Angel and Collins, and JoAnn and Maureen, there is love all around -- not including the love in friendship they have for one another. They are willing to go to extreme lengths to save their friends and show the true love that they have for each other.Between ""Your Eyes"" and ""I'll Cover You"" I was in tears. It was so moving, the way the songs tied in and the love they showed for one another through the songs..So now i'm just rambling...but needless to say, I would highly recommend RENT.",Rent

Very talented people singing AT me endlessly, very loudly. It's the kind of performance musical that can work very well live but be less than wonderful on film. I found few characters that were not achingly clichéd and the entire Aids dilemma treated somewhat superficially. Angel's show stopping number was stupendous and one of the few that made me sit up and take notice. But the ending was a cheat (stolen no doubt from ""Lifetime"" TV movies) and the final clubbing to make sure everyone ""got"" the La Boheme connection unnecessary. I WAS checking my watch about 2/3 of the way through just wanting it to end. If you loved the B'way show you will probably love the film but, for me, the film was not terrific.",Rent

RENT certainly does not contain a great deal of comedy and is not for people who are wishing to see a light- hearted movie. It is deep and thought provoking portrayal of serious situations in the lives aspiring adults who are struggling through life. The idea that most of them are struggling with Aids makes this the movie take on an intriguing form. This is the first play (then movie) to deal with the rising issue and it is truly groundbreaking.

It brings up gay marriage and HIV and AIDS and is absolutely fabulous. I recommend this movie to pretty much everyone, it was...just incredible. I was sobbing steadily after the second half of the movie. A really inspiring movie all together. They cut out some of the songs from the OBC, but a nice production overall. Rosario Dawson replaced Daphne Rubin-Vega, and although Roasario did a good job, she just wasn't Mimi. Her voice was very computerized and if Daphne Rubin-Vega wasn't pregnant you bet that this movie would have been that much better. Fredi Walker was replaced by Traci Thoms, and Traci was mind-blowing. Incredible performances from both of these stars make it hard to choose which did a better job. Bits and pieces from both the OBC and the movie soundtrack would make the perfect RENT. Buy both though, it's worth your money. And go to the show, for an even more incredible experience.",Rent

His lenses provide a stark glimpse on these nightmares and their effects in the community in the advent of the 1990's.His whole movie pays homage to human values forged out of sheer candor, loneliness, toil, and true and tested friendship. Casting some members from the original musical imbues sensuality and a fiery determination to succeed. Joanne and Maureen allow the audience to witness the powerful dynamic and conflictive societal forces shaping their lesbian relationship, and transport the audience through the emotionally turbulent pastures of their love. Angel's performance is deliciously queer, veritable and real. His acting awesomely led a mesmerized audience into the labyrinths of a relationship marked by passion, trust and mutual understanding, all emotions seen in his eyes, evocative lips, enthralled smiles and soft-spoken lines.

He did not massacre the film at all. He stayed true to the show and spirit that Mr. Larson created and took it to a whole new level in this film. The cinematography also deserves mention as it was one of the best I've seen. This cast and crew really put together an excellent show.When wound together the story, music and characters are what create RENT - a classic story that I hope touches people for years on end.

I've been in love with the play for almost ten years now, and I was dreading another adaptation that leaves a bad taste in my mouth. My fears, however, were unwarranted. This is by far my favorite stage to screen adaptation, and even my boyfriend who admittedly hates musicals, liked it.That being said, there were a few songs not included in this film. Other than the ""goodbye, Love"" and ""Halloween"" that a previous poster mentioned, they also did not include ""Contact"". I was a little disappointed, since I was curious how the director would handle the sex scene, but the route he chose was fantastic nonetheless.The acting was superb. Rosario Dawson (Mimi) totally exceeded my expectations, and I was thrilled to see so much of the original cast in the film. everyone did a wonderful job, and I was moved to tears more than once, laughed out loud a few times, and quietly sang along with some of the more memorable tunes.The only people in the theater that did not seem to enjoy it, were a couple of teenage boys that probably had no clue it was even a musical, or dealt with homosexual relationships and AIDS, and whatnot. They left after about 20 minutes, uttering profanities as they exited the theater.

I do have to say, Collins and Angel were probably my two favorite characters from the movie when Mark is my fav from the actual show. They just seem to still have that connection they did on stage.

This movie stays extremely true to the script of the play, which adapting it just so that it fits the screen. I have to admit certain scenes were odd. IE Roger in Santa Fe... that was just cheesy... but the addition of flashbacks of Roger and April gave me chills. And the people at the Life Support meetings, the look of fear on their faces also gave me chills. I was upset that they cut out some of the best songs... Goodbye Love, Christmas Bells, Halloween... but I understand it was to cut the time down, as most people don't want to sit through a 3 hour movie... but I'll tell you , for this film, I would have.

The acting was superb, the music was great, and it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. My husband agreed. He said, and I quote ""I think this is one my favorite movies of all time.""

Unfortunately when dealing with such a heavy issue there is no real raw emotion from any of the actors. It is almost cheeky at times.I had the pleasure of watching RENT on Broadway when I was 17, and I loved it immensely. Perhaps our ideas and opinions change as we grow older, because at 23 and in my first year of law school, I have a new perspective on drug-addicts that don't want to get real jobs, because that would be selling out.I don't know perhaps I am too biased because I saw it on Broadway...and with that there is no comparison.

Perhaps the most realistic and touching relationship is that of Collins and Angel, an unlikely pair that prove to give the film its strongest vocal performances. Tracie Thoms is a great new addition to the cast and her powerhouse chords and straight-up sass leave you wanting more.

I thought that the movie was brilliant. Despite my friend mumbling beside me about the differences between the movie and the stage performance, I had the ability to simply enjoy the film, not the play attached to it. Because of this, I found it inspiring, and poignant. Rent sends a message that says that you must take the bull by the horns and do what you can with the life you have. I walked out of the theater feeling confident and filled with a sense of hope. Of course only a movie with strong emotion can do that to you, and Rent did it to me.

511,girlcheeze,Amazing,10,25 November 2005,"Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Not surprising, of course, considering it is THE best musical I've ever seen. I was a little nervous about the movie, knowing the director, as well as the two new faces. Then there's the fact that it took place about 15-16 years ago, and might seem outdated. I can promise you right now it's not. The message is just as fresh as it was nine years ago. All the characters, new and old, had spectacular performances. As for the director, he was very good. There were some things I wish he had done differently (during some of the spoken lines I was screaming ""Sing it!"") but I understood why he did them. And without him, there probably wouldn't have been the original cast doing it, and that was one of the best parts for me, and one of the best things that could've happened for this movie. Quite honestly, who's going to take Justin Timberlake (who was considered for this movie) seriously when he's trying to be broke and singing those powerful songs? I couldn't. Besides, the original cast just IS Rent, really. However, the new faces were amazing, the biggest surprise being Rosario Dawson in my opinion. When I first heard she was in it, I went ""Can she even sing?"" Yes, she can. I still love Daphne Rubin-Vega, but Rosario still far exceeded my expectations. Finally, I thought the issue of homosexuality was handled well. It was skipped around. And while Maureen and Joanne's relationship was constantly being thrust forward for it's gay aspects, it was only because of Mark's part in it. And Collins and Angel were just handled as a relationship, which it was. No big fuss about it. I thought that was possibly the best part. I was worried about it. I hadn't seen Collins and Angel kiss in the previews. I got worried. Were Mo and Jo going to be used as a comical pairing, and Collins and Angel ignored altogether? But my fears were pointless. The movie was done very well, in my opinion.",Rent
512,heathseal,Great Adaptation,8,26 November 2005,"Having seen the original Broadway cast and two other performances of the play afterwards I wasn't quite sure if I wanted to see the movie or not. Happily though I can state that I thought the adaptation faithfully represented the spirit of the play without detracting from the most important parts of the play. The music still sounds great. Only one major song was cut from play to movie and although it is one of my favorites, it is a little heartbreaking so perhaps it was better that number was cut after all. Some small gripes though for the continuity people - did you not notice the incredibly annoying female extra with the world's brightest orange hat walking/staring at Collins and Angel in the flea market? Cause I sure noticed her - she was in every frame! And what's up with the posters in the subway scene? The MTA bridge ad jumps from one side of the car to the other repeatedly.",Rent
513,Ambee311,There are no words to describe how wonderful...,10,23 November 2005,"To start off, let me explain that I am a huge RENTHead. I have been obsessed with the show for many years and have been counting down to this movie since I heard it was even going to be made. I have checked IMDb along with every blog site or anything containing any RENT information throughout the months leading up to RENT. I was more then excited.As it neared the movie's release date I began to see negative reviews by many magazines and newspapers. I realized going into this movie that not everyone in America was going to enjoy it, in fact, knowing the story so well and some American's mindsets I did not expect an amazing box office turnout. The reviews were very concerning, and though I was still very excited I went in with it expecting to not be blown away but still appreciate it because it was RENT, my obsession.I had hoped for the best for months and heard through the blogs from the cast and Chris Columbus (the director) only positive things and how true Columbus was staying to Jonathon Laron's message and original story, which is something I was very concerned with and pleased to hear. Seeing the movie, though, was an experience all in itself. I was moved to tears, laughed quite hard, and felt as if my life had been changed for the better after the movie had ended. I have seen the show on Broadway 4 times, going to be 5 soon, and always cry at certain points and leave the show a better person. I began the show with tears in my eyes for the facts that I was seeing something I had awaited for months and because Seasons of Love is so powerful and you know you are beginning to see an experience that is going to change you in more ways than one. I was a little worried as it began for the beginning is a bit slow. However, once we get to the ""Tango Maureen"" number it was only one amazing ride from then on. I could not stop smiling and laughing during La Vie Boheme, Idina and Tracie's voices blew me away along with Columbus's genius during ""Take me or Leave me"", I could not stop crying during ""Life Support"" and from ""Without You"" to the end of the film I was in hysterics.This movie does more than tell a story, it shares Larson's message of love and its importance and treasuring each day. There really is ""no day but today"" and as we learn from the relationships in this film, love is blind and to truly love and be loved is the greatest thing in this world. In the words of Chris Columbus ""Thank you Jonathon Larson"" and now, after seeing this film, thank you Chris Columbus.",Rent
514,jkf-6,"A story about life, love, loss explored through late 80's early 90's bohemian counterculture.",7,23 November 2005,"I have been an avid RENT fan for years and years now, and was lucky enough to receive free tickets to a screening before the release date. While filled with excitement and terror I saw Jonathan Larson's name come onto a black screen in white type and could only hope that Chris Columbus did the film justice.The feeling of the first electrifying chords of ""rent"" was lost to dialogue and the abrupt start and stop transitions in songs. The added dialogue I think left the film feeling choppy whereas the theatrical production cohesively transitioned from place to place with musical interludes and most lines sung.The effort was noble though, in an attempt to accommodate to an audience that would look down on a musical in the strictest sense.In trying to avoid the ""cheesy"" label that musicals often are given, scenes in your what you own with Roger's hair blowing in the wind and then triumphantly climbing desert rock while Mark rides his bike through New York is putting in into a ""cheesy"" category that the theatrical production was never close to.The film was littered with awkward close ups, angles and a feeling like the transition from stage to film was pushed. The actors were left standing singing to one another rather than having movement of any kind let alone a large dance number (aside from La Vie Boheme).All this aside though, the message and feeling is left in tact, and I still had tears in my eyes many times. The story is all there, I just wish it was more creatively shot and movement was payed attention to.",Rent

Now that I've seen it, I understand them completely and how they fit together.I came into this movie knowing only the bad parts: AIDS, lesbians, and drag queens. If this is all you have heard about Rent, don't judge too quickly; this is only the bare bones of the story. That was all I expected, but I got so much more.

Watching the film was definitely moving. This flawless film touched my heart and hits close to home for some people. Just think of what they couldn't do in the play and how much more creativity and the larger scenery there is to work with. If you loved the Broadway performance then you love it on the big screen. RENT will keep you singing with a smile the entire film. It makes you look at life a little bit harder and just gives you that sense to live for today, don't live in regret. I definitely think taking the time out to see this film will make more people open up their hearts and how they view society in many ways. Like they say..No Day But Today",Rent
517,ris622,"The music was great, and so is the story, but...",7,3 January 2006,"I really enjoyed the music and the actors/actresses were great-they played their respective parts very well. I especially enjoyed the way they adapted the ""Tango Maureen."" I greatly anticipated this movie--I was one of those kids who saw Rent during its opening run on stage in '96, and I have seen it again and again. It was so different than any musical I had ever seen....However, I was disappointed in the film in the sense that I felt that if you didn't see the play you wouldn't understand the dichotomy between the characters. Nor do I think they developed the characters enough. All in all though, it was worth seeing and worth owning on DVD (when it comes out) because I believe they were true to the story and message Larson endeavored to convey and his legacy will continue to live on and these stage actors and actresses will now have the opportunity to further their careers in whatever direction they want.",Rent
518,dmartinminn,You will NOT be disappointed.,9,22 November 2005,"I saw a special screening of RENT last night 11/21, at the Senator Theater in Baltimore (Tracie Thoms' hometown) and LOVED it! The screening was part of a benefit for the Baltimore School for the Arts -- Tracie is a graduate of the school. She, Anthony Rapp and Wilson Heredia made special appearances and spoke briefly before the screening. This experience in itself was AWESOME! If you're expecting the movie to be the stage version on film, you're wasting your money. The movie is not better or worse than the musical, but equally AMAZING.The entire cast from the nine principals to those in the Life Support meetings are superb! The essence, energy and emotion of the show are intact. If you're a fan of the show, there is no need to worry. If you are an open-minded movie-goer there is also no need to worry. RENT is a movie experience that will leave you wanting to see it again. I definitely plan on going to see it at least two more times.Come Wednesday the 23rd, RUN do NOT walk to movie theaters to see the movie version of RENT. You will NOT be disappointed.",Rent
519,sesnyder120,"Mixed bag, good outweighs the bad",7,24 November 2005,"Let's just say I'm curious to see what somebody who is clueless about Rent thought about this movie. I'm honestly not sure if the things I hated are because I love the show, and if the things I loved are because I love the show. Overall, it left me with the same ""wow, that was something special"" feeling, but at the same time...I dunno...grasping for more? First, the bad news...The beginning. What's up w/ that??? And I'm not talking about leading w/ Seasons of Love, that was fine. The very beginning is where the characters get introduced, and I got the sense that people who weren't familiar with the show or the story would be a little clueless. I've seen the show twice, and even I was a little bit ""um..what's happening?"" The fact that almost NOTHING happens before Rent was just a little weird. And everything within the song that gives any further indication as to what on earth is going on was cut as well. The thoughts in my head were honestly ""Good Lord, what have they done???""The songs were absolutely fantastic (except What You Own), but I felt like the space between the songs was just bland filler. On stage you don't get that feeling. Maybe because stuff that was originally sung was spoken? Maybe because they faded out after every song like it was the end of a music video? I'm not sure exactly why.Something was just...*missing*. I think it was the audience and the charge in the air of a live show. Rent is different from a more traditional show like Phantom. It's not just a ""sit back and watch"" kind of thing. You are engaged. It's almost interactive. Some people in my theater clapped a little after Today For You, Tomorrow For Me, (and Over the Moon, and La Vie Boheme, etc etc...)and I felt compelled to as well but it was a movie theater and it felt a little odd. It also felt like there should be mooing. The closing shot on Angel...close but no cigar. I was actually looking forward to him coming out to sing with them and experiencing that moment of joy, but it didn't come. I'm not saying it should be a Rocky Horror kind of thing, but in the theater you are just so right there with them! Particularly during Seasons of Love--they did a good job here for what it was, but when they're up on that stage, lined up across the front, and making eye contact with the audience--that's just powerful!! Having said all that, I can begin my rave. I loved it and will definitely see it again and buy it when it comes out on DVD. I never saw Daphne Rubin-Vega on stage, but her voice on the OBC drives me up the wall, so Rosario Dawson was a welcome addition, and she NAILED Out Tonight. I always hated that song before because it sounded like nails on a blackboard to me, and now it might be one of my faves. Tracy Thoms was a great Joanne, and her frustration and love really come through. Tango Maureen? Good God that was fantastic! At first I thought it was kind of blasphemous that we saw Maureen before Over The Moon, but it really and truly worked. The highlight was absolutely, hands down, I'll Cover You (Reprise). Collins completely broke my heart. I cry pretty easily in movies, you know the old tear down the cheek...I was actually SOBBING, struggling to control myself! Far more than the stage show, too. And Take Me For What I Am? The commitment ceremony thing was weird, I never got the sense they were heading that direction, but it was a great setting for a great song. Contact wasn't missed. Well, seeing all the bodies writhing under a white sheet would have been kinda cool, but for me the song was always about leading into Angel's death, which was handled VERY nicely in Without You.The story is the same captivating tale of love, and is just as timely today as it has always been. The words and music couldn't help but convey that message. That is what makes Rent Rent. Thank you, Jonathan Larson, indeed.",Rent

521,munky79,"RENT, a motion picture event.",9,29 November 2005,"I have mixed feelings watching the film, but overall I am still in love with this piece as if I seen if for the first time live. I don't think the film version did any justice for the original stage production; however a film like Rent is one of a kind. You won't find anything like this released before in film history. People had asked me what Rent was about and I would find it was difficult to explain. I do not believe that this film was about AIDS or homosexuality. I do not believe this is about a love story either. It would be safe to say that I do believe that Rent is about a group of friends dealing with life, hope, struggle, and living their lives to the fullest before their time is over. The film version of Rent just made it simple to digest, but lacked some character development. To my surprise, Columbus managed to keep Rent true in the film that it still delivered the same powerful message as it did in the live production of Rent. I considered this piece of literature brilliant, not to mention that it won the Pulitzer Prize shortly after Larson's death. Rob Cavalo, the producer of the Green Day soundtrack (Dookie) produced the new film soundtrack and revived the tunes with a fresh alternative and soulful edge. It is one of the first musical to talk about real life issues and situations such as homelessness, drug abuse and coping with life-threatening diseases. The reviews are pretty mixed with the good and the bad. As for myself, I believed that those who did enjoyed the film, found it to be inspirational and uplifting despite of the dark subject matter. The contents of Rent dealt with issues that these audiences could relate to. It's also was the first show to altered people's way of thinking and living, especially during the troubled times of our lives. The fiery ""Rent"" introduction leaves it memorable for those who seen this film for the first time. The flashbacks in ""One Song Glory"" and ""Without You"" worked exceptionally well. Scenes such as ""Tango: Maureen"" and ""La Vie Boheme"" were among the best performances of the film. Dawson who portrayed Mimi in her rendition of ""Out Tonight"" will have you drooling for more. She is hot stuff! Menzel and Thoms had great on screen chemistry especially during ""Take Me or Leave Me."" Even though I had some technical issues with the film, I will say that the performance of each cast members is still remarkable. I felt that the transitions between songs and scenes were not as fluid as it should be. In a recent interview, Columbus announced that he cut ""Goodbye Love"" because this particular scene was too emotional and would distract the audiences from understanding the big picture of Rent. This was a foolish mistake. Columbus should have never allowed his camped-up version of ""What You Own"" to be part of the final cut. This is the only part of the film that did not flow correctly and made no sense of why the character Roger left home. ""Goodbye Love"" would have revealed Roger's motivations and intentions for departing. As for the upcoming awards, I would predict that Jesse L. Martin and Rosario Dawson are likely to get nominations for best supporting actor/actress and probably best cinematography for the film itself. Honorable mentions also go out to Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms for their outstanding performance. On November 23rd. 12 AM. From Eastern to Pacific Standard Time. And as the hour raced over one time zone at a time, the highly anticipated film adaptation of Rent dominated the silver screens at the struck of Thanksgiving. In cities across the nation, an unexpected turn out of the film packed theatres with scores of Rent-enthusiasts whom they called themselves, ""Rentheads."" The entire auditorium was seen peppered and lavished with those wearing flashy decorative Rent shirts and home made costumes. Some sported cat ears along with black and white scarves that dangled from their necks. The event was similar to scenes of the typical Rent posters and the Rent trailers seen before in advertisements. Like characters that flew off a television set, the elated and emotionally touched, embraced each another with their shared stories and tears. For most, this was a journey that began 5 years ago when Spike Lee was rumored to immortalized Rent ""through the single frames that forever flickered in close-ups."" Truly, this is a notable cinematic picture event that had become a part of our generation. Once again...Thank you Jonathan Larson.",Rent

I bought it shortly after it came out and it's constantly in my DVD player. I also bought the soundtrack for it. The movie just has a way of making everything else around you disappear.

The music and songs are so amazing and the acting really brings the stage play alive on the big screen. The movie has almost the entire original Broadway cast, minus the original Mimi and Joann. A few things have been changed but it completely works. Anyone who loved the play will feel like it was done justice. I can't express how much I loved this movie.

I'm a HUGE fan of RENT, and I was supposed to love this movie and go see it ten times. I'll wait for DVD! This is not the passionate play that helped define me as a person. This was a PC, pretty-people-with-problems movie. The musical performances were mostly good, some excellent. I did have a problem with Roger going to Santa Fe on a mountain...reminded me of a Bon Jovi video. But, there were elements to the story that were totally not needed... Joanne's engagement to Maureen, and Joanne's parents' unconditional acceptance of it. (a far cry from the play when they don't want her to wear Doc Martin's, leave Maureen at home, and wear a bra to an event).The story moved along too fast. Even at 2 hours and 15 minutes, the ending was abrupt due to cutting a lot out of the end of the 2nd act.Even though it featured many of the OBC, I didn't really care that much about the characters. No one really had a connection. Where was Angel and Collins' flirtation? For the first time the story takes place in specific year 1989-90, but you wouldn't know that from the costumes and sets. It looked too 21st Century. Also, references to ""Thelma and Louise"" and the Oklahoma City Bombing are out of place because they hadn't happened yet.If you want a good movie about people in the East Village in the 80's rent ""200 Cigarettes""!",Rent

I felt like Jesse L. Martin and Adam Pascal were amazing to watch. I love everyone but those two really stood out to me. the bursting out into song was not awkward at all and the whole feel of the move over all just really worked.

The scenery was vivid, the music was loud and clear, and for the first time I felt as if these characters were three dimensional and had a cause.The thing that drove me out was the idea of the original cast members returning to their roles. Idina Menzel stood out among them all in my eyes with her comedic and sultry performance as Maureen. For the males, Adam Pascal was without a doubt my favorite.Rosario Dawson was one of two newcomers and I thought she was amazing. I was pretty skeptic about her singing at first, but once I heard that voice, I was nothing less than amazed.Come Oscar time, I would love to see RENT nominated for a few... maybe best picture, best supporting actress... who knows...

BUT YOU'RE MISTAKEN Take another look at the movie, and compare the outcome to how horribly it could have been portrayed. Yes, songs were omitted. That's because it's a 2.5hr running play, with almost straight song. This movie had to appeal to more than just the die-hard fans. Yes, some lyrics were spoken. That caught me off guard a bit, too...but they did it with such fashion (take, for example, when Benny is first introduced and he's on the street with Mark and Roger asking about Maureen).

I was a little reluctant to go in to the cinema because i normally find musicals disappointing. Thankfully, i was persuaded to go in! If i had missed it - i'd probably never have got the chance to see it again and that would be a major mistake. For me, it was the best experience of the whole film festival. The vocal range of all the cast members was astonishing. Jesse.L.Martin (as Tom Collins) has soul and the most meaningful singing voice i have heard for many years. Think of Barry White crossed with Marvin Gaye! Yes....he is that good! A joy to listen to...as where all the cast. They were all generous with each other, obviously well trained. We are talking about good old fashioned talent here. These are ""old school"" professionals all working in harmony. I am an actor too and i think that to be working with other professionals who all know what they are doing...is the best damn thing since a pint of Guiness! I bet they loved shooting it.As for the content, it actually had a message, it had something to say. Not just a singular message either....it had many. The struggles of life and adversity in East Village New York are real. People do live in this world and i therefore sympathise with the characters. In this movie there is loss, freedom, death, tragedy, success and so much love! Grown men in the cinema where in tears one minute and laughing like lunatics the next minute! RENT was made even more pleasurable as the main cast members where in the audience, Tracie Toms and Wilson Jermaine Heredia (Joanne and Angel respectively)...and they were lovely to talk to. Good luck to all the cast and crew of RENT.I will watch more musicals having seen RENT. I practically was a ""musicals virgin"" when i entered the cinema ....last night i lost my virginity...and as usually happens in such cases....i will be begging for more very soon!

The only problem with this is that some of the characters are in their 30's when they are supposed to be playing people in their 20's and you can definitely tell. I am a bit biased because I absolutely loved the stage version and I have been a fan of this show for 5 years now. The music evokes strong emotion going from laughter to tears in a matter of minutes. Any show that has the capabilities to do that is amazing within itself. The storyline is basically about a bunch of bohemian friends struggling to live in poverty and living with the AIDS virus.

Would it do the musical justice? So on November 23rd, when I walked into the movie theater, waiting anxiously for the movie to start, the thoughts were still present. Finally, the lights dimmed and the previews began. Previews for movies like ""The Producers"" and ""Take the Lead,"" flashed before my eyes. I began to shake, biting my lip...then the screen went dark. You see names that you know belong to the movie like Chris Columbus and Jonathan Larson. The words RENT flash on the screen and my belly flops. The movie begins with the main cast on a stage and they sing ""Seasons of Love,"" my breath is still held. Then it began. The magic began, because that is what the movie is. Pure magic. I can't remember when a movie left me feeling so satisfied. Even if I had seen a million and a half things about the movie, everything seemed fresh. The actors were wonderful and completely believable. You cared about the characters and were passionate about their futures. Near the end there wasn't a dry eye in the entire theater.

There are some elements that make the journey on screen worthwhile (like the La Vie Boehme scene) but the director included so many things that should be resting in peace with the Broadway version that it ruined the entire experience for me. Namely the ridiculous frequency with which the characters raise their clenched fists in the air, sing on fire escapes, dance on tables and run through the streets holding hands in elation/anger. Every time a song came on  especially songs written by the horrible, boring, brooding, mopey Roger  I felt like yelling out ""hey assholes, Beverly Hills 90210 called  it wants its guitar riffs back"". The only film worse than this is Mark's documentary which amounts not to any sort of profound statement on anything but a home-video-esquire montage of Omigawd-don't-film-me-I'm-so-embarrassed scenes. And if the skyward wailing and slapping on the proverbial wrists of anyone who makes a living in a non-artistic manner (non-artistic being prostitution, stripping, killing dogs, dealing drugs, pan-handling, or riding your bike and having AIDS) doesn't grate on your nerves then perhaps the fallacy of the set and wardrobe and overall appearance of the characters will. The loft boasts a design similar to Urban Outfitters, the outfits lead you to believe these guys are anything but successful actors with a knack for shabby-chic and not to mention the fact that everyone who is supposedly infected with AIDS, starving, addicted to drugs etc. etc. looks like they'd scarcely be able to get out of a high school P.E. class. The entire movie is based on the ridiculous notion that everyone in this piece of crap thinks they shouldn't have to pay rent because they're 'artists' who have led irresponsible lives filled with unprotected sex, intravenous drugs and as a result now have AIDS. Damn those cops, landlords, news station executives all to hell  how dare they expect US to pay rent  we're bohemians!!"" If every bleeding AIDS heart got free rent for being stupid enough to do heroin in an alley using a mystery needle, after having anonymous unprotected sex then the land lords in NY during the 1980's and 90's and their families would all have been starving on the streets along with the bohemian morons that this film attempts to immortalize. Now if the bankrupted land lords pooled their resources and made a film entitled ""Die Bohemian Douche bags, Die"" I might actually pay 12 dollars to go see that.Oh.AND pay special attention to the scenes depicting Rogers escape to Santa Feif you look closely enough you can actually see Britney Spears filming her ""I'm not a girl, not yet a woman video"" in the background.",Rent

538,deundrewright,Rent the movie,10,31 March 2015,"In this timeless classic, viewers are shown the true power of love. It shows the lives of eight misfits trying to make it in New York City. As the movie goes along you got an inside look at what each character struggles with and What lessons they learn. Many times in the movie, the characters learn that love is a very powerful voice that can sometimes save lives. Time and time throughout the movie we see the characters celebrate life , even in the face of death. They continuously help each other up when the other has fallen. This movies is one of the best portrayals of real life events and struggles. The story of Jonathan Larson is a very powerful one. The night before Rent's first preview, Jonathan went to his dress rehearsal, and later went back to his apartment where he died. Ever since his passing, Jonathan Larson has become an instant sensation.",Rent
539,theatre_savvy_pirate,No Day But Today - Rent comes to the big screen,8,1 December 2005,"After seeing the show in January, I soon began to fall in love with Rent as well as Jonathan Larson's music. There was something captivating and beautiful about Rent. So one could only imagine my excitement when I found out the musical I had grown to love was being made into a movie.Most of the stars in the film are from the original Broadway cast. Among those who stand out are Jesse L. Martin (Tom Collins) and Anthony Rapp (Mark Cohen) as well as Adam Pascal (Roger). Rosario Dawson (Mimi Marquez) is a fresh face in the cast and does a terrific job of portraying her character.Roger and Mark used to live with Benny, Maureen (Mark's ex-girlfriend), and Collins. However, times have changed and Benny is now the landlord of the apartment complex. One night, Mark and Roger get an unexpected visit from Benny, soon realizing that rent must be paid - or they will be evicted!(""Rent"") As much as both hate their home, it's a home and they are desperate to keep it. But Benny has a plan, and tells the two that if they can stop Maureen's protest (against CyberArts), then they can stay there rent-free (""You'll See"") But saving a protest is harder than imagined, and Mark must deal with Maureen's new girlfriend - Joanne (""Tango: Maureen"").As this is going on, Tom Collins has met Angel, a street performer who took care of him when he was attacked by a street gang. Angel and Tom begin dating as well as going to Life Support meetings. The Life Support scenes, though short, are some of the best parts of the film. Especially during the song ""Without You,"" as certain members slowly fades away. When asked about fearing his trial with AIDS, one member replies ""I'm a New Yorker. Fear's my life."" But what really moved me was when they all began to sing, ""Will I lose my dignity? Will someone care? Will I wake tomorrow from this nightmare?"" in a round. Wow.The relationship between Roger and Mimi is notable, as it begins innocently (""Light My Candle"") which is definitely one of the highlights of the film. However, it gets bitter when Roger suddenly pushes Mimi away and comes to realize she and Benny had had a relationship.Things grow bitter for Tom and Angel as well. AIDS has taken its toll on Angel as he gets sicker and sicker and eventually passes on.The overall message of Rent is a powerful one - no matter how much you have suffered, you can move on. It's simply living your life through love, as ""Seasons of Love"" teaches us.""No other road, no other way. No day but today."" 8/10",Rent
540,potterdork,Wow!,10,29 November 2005,"I saw this musical several years ago on stage and have been in love with it ever since. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical when I found out it was being made into a movie since I was so disappointed with what movie makers did with ""Phantom of the Opera."" (I would have liked it more if they had chosen someone else to play the Phantom) Yet, being a fan of Rent, I gave it a chance and I'm sure glad I did! It was so well casted! The vocal performances were divine! And again, I was moved to tears by the music and storyline. I would have to say the best characters vocally were Joanne and Tom Collins, yet the others were fantastic as well. And Angel's look was perfect! I will probably see it a few more times (for a few more cries)and will definitely be purchasing the DVD (How long will I have to wait?) Don't walk, America...run! Run to the movies and see Rent! You'll thank me later!",Rent

Because i am in england, i never got the grace of being able to see it live so i can't compare, but i have to say it is one of the best musicals to date, and i see it's not to everyones taste, since it has got some bad press. It's nice to see Chris Columbus didn't butcher it, in fact he made a pretty great job of it.Also, r.i.p Jonathan Larson, who died on the opening night of Rent in broad way in 1996.10/10 Highly recommended.",Rent
542,jcap66,"See this Movie, BUT the live show is still better",7,27 June 2006,"Myself, and the folks with whom I saw this movie, didn't feel it dated, nor did we feel the actors too old to reprise their roles, as some critics have said. It was so great to see the original players reprise their roles on screen. Minor complaints, like some of the music being cut out, except for one glaring issue: Rosario Dawson CANNOT sing. What a letdown to hear such wonderful songs as ""Without You"", ""Out Tonight"", ""No Day But Today"" etc., with no punch, no emotion, no passion, such as they were sung by Daphne Rubin-Vega, and everyone who played Mimi that we saw in three different touring companies. I find it hard to believe she was the best they could find for that role. It was almost as if Adam Pascal had to change the way he sung the duets, just to accommodate how poorly she sung. I own the movie, and I watch it often, but I have to skip the scenes where she's featured because they are such a letdown. She's nowhere near as strong as the other actors/singers, and was a very poor choice to play Mimi. That said, the music is still as relevant today as it was in the mid-90's, and it's heartbreaking to think Jonathan Larson never got to see audiences enjoy his work.",Rent
543,carlhernz,A Smart Adaptation With Few Reservations,7,5 December 2005,"It's been said before: For those who loved the stage version, Chris Columbus' interpretation will likely be just as loved. It is a smart adaptation of the Pulitzer-prize winning modern rendition of Puccini's ""La Boheme"" by the late but genius Jonathan Larson. If there are any reservations, there are few but this will depend largely on point of view and personal taste.The film has a gritty flavor, and it gives the impression that Chris Columbus has grown up especially fast (or that he has always really had this side to him), in that there is little magic, glitter, and all that is clean that usually finds its ways into movie musicals. RENT doesn't need it and shouldn't have it. All that was un-apologetic about the lovable stage version is kept alive in this motion picture. Applause for the director.As for the reservations, this has to do with what you define the original work of RENT as being? Is it a musical? Is it an opera? Is it a concert? Technically, it's a modern opera with little dialog and most interchanges made via recitative performed as a concert and advertised as a ""musical"" for a society that still thinks opera is a type of music instead of a device for story-telling or genre.So for many, this is what made RENT stand out from your average musical, turning modern-day conversations about fixing uncooperative sampling equipment, letting lesbians be lesbians, and finding out how annoying someone named Alexi Darling can be as she leaves all her contact information on an answering machine--all this and more was sung, whether or not it rhymed, and whether or not the dialog had a poetic flavor to it. This is part of the genius of the original work that you will not find watching the movie. It is a shame, whether or not you appreciate the ""real"" stuff in opera, because one is never sure if Jonathan Larson and the cast are paying tribute to the art of opera, mocking it, or both at the same time.So while the spirit of the original work is definitely intact, some of the soul is markedly missing. Yet, screenwriter Stephen Chbosky is equally as clever as turning this into actual dialog, keeping a lot of the poetry intact as prose, and with the director the limitations of the previous medium are broken down through this newer format. It runs almost seamlessly at times because the characters and the action doesn't pause as in the regular musical where you think: ""Oh no! They're going to sing."" Dialogue becomes song and vice versa. It does come across ""gappy"" for those familiar with the original score, but the new performances and fuller orchestra make up for this as does the way the scenes were opened up in the film.Where some have complained that some of the cast is too old for the characters they originally played a decade ago, in this interpretation it is the best thing going. Could the musical-like treatment of an opera-like show have survived an entirely new and younger cast? Problematic at best, but again these reservations are little compared with what we do have, and that is a very fine movie, moving and passionate, carrying the story of love effectively from the screen to the heart.All the performances are great, including the new additions to the cast. For the music may seem to ""performed"" verses the free style (and often very loud) smaller stage band that provided it for the stage.On its own merits, as a film, it is great. If you've little experience with RENT, you'll have no regrets. If you love the original, try and take the film for what it is. It really is good despite the fact that the public is deserving of the gift of truer renditions of stage musicals than what is often offered by Hollywood.",Rent
544,iloveemoviees,Phenomenal Movie!,10,1 September 2015,"RENT is by far my all time favorite movie! From the characters, the story-line, to the singing, RENT is all-around perfection. It's one of those movies where you watch over and over and it feels like you've become apart of the film. The movie is personal, heart-felt, and real. Yes, they may be characters, but they portray real life situations. You connect with the characters. To this day, RENT feels fresh and new. I always watch it and sing along with the family. Still amazes me how good of a film this is. I highly recommend you to watch RENT. It's great from the beginning to the end. Trust me, you won't be disappointed in this masterpiece of a movie!",Rent
545,doncasper,The worst musical on the planet.,1,23 July 2008,"As far as musicals go, I am a love em or hate em type of guy. I despise Rent with every ounce of my soul. If I could I would eliminate all traces of the movie Rent from the planet. Rent was a more miserable and agonizing time than getting my wisdom teeth removed. The first problem is that the songs are bland and uninteresting, and each song seems like a repeat of the last song with slightly different intonation and a few different instruments. A lot of movies have this problem. However most movies are not musicals. When a musical has bland and repetitive music you have yourself a problem. The second problem is the movie kills off the only compelling character halfway through, leaving you to suffer through the rest of the movie wishing for a swift demise. The remaining characters spend their time whining about what a tyrant the landlord is because he wants his back rent. Imagine that. The landlord wants 3 years of back rent. Apparently the landlord doesn't understand that if you spend your entire time making bad music, you do not need to pay your rent. Rent also spends most of its time hopping between vaguely intertwined plot points, hopping from location to location randomly and in such a fashion that it causes the movie to be about twice as long as a movie such as rent really should be. For instance out of nowhere one of the characters decides to take a road trip, and the movie jumps back and forth between the other characters looking despondent and the character on the road trip, for no apparent reason at all, because at the end of the montage he appears back at their apartment in New York. 30 seconds later the entire sequence is forgotten, and it appears to have little bearing on what happens in the film, other than being a completely extraneous scene with no other use other than delaying the inevitable and welcome end of the movie. Bottom Line: Unless you absolutely hate yourself, do not rent this movie. Rent a compelling musical like Moulin Rouge, Hairspray, Across the Universe, the Producers, Sweeney Todd, or any number of other compelling contemporary musicals. Do not rent Rent.",Rent

I know the reviews have been somewhat mixed, but I still wanted to see it. So I dragged a friend along with me to see it. Knew there was a big problem when one of the songs mentions Thelma and Louise in its lyrics - how could a movie from 1991 be mentioned in a movie set in 1989? So anyway, we stayed for about 1/2 an hour and we just couldn't watch this boring, dated movie any longer. We got up and left and for the first time ever at a movie theater - we asked the manager for our money back! Don't waste your $10 or your time.",Rent

My review...I didn't feel the high energy like i did in the 3 times i have seen RENT on Broadway until the ""Tango Maureen"" song that was done Brilliantly!! Then from then on, I felt the energy and emotion and the true depth of feeling from all the strong characters and songs. ""Another Day"" was also perfect as well as ""La Vie Bohemme"". But the scene stealer is the ""Over the moon"" song that is difficult to do in a movie setting but was incredibly well done in this movie...Hats off to Chris Columbus for giving us true RENT fans exactly what we wanted.

I bought the soundtrack for the movie the day it came out and was truly impressed but also disappointed because there were several key songs missing. The cast was fantastic! However, prepare to be disappointed. What Chris Columbus and Steve Chbosky did to Rent can only be described as butchery. I went into the film having a very open mind, knowing that not all movies strictly adhere to the stage version. The director and screenwriter completely missed the point as to the meaning behind Rent, the meaning behind its characters, and the meaning behind 'Seasons of Love.' For those of you who disagree, listen to the original cast recording again and then see the movie again. This film can only be described as a hack-job and the producers saw the successes from Chicago and Mulan Rouge and wanted in on a potential cash cow. Take a look at the director's list of films, the only success stories were Harry Potter, Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire. Also look at the genres to which his successes were in. Clearly he could not handle the all the meaning and symbolism in a work such as Rent, otherwise he would not have been so ""emotionally exhausted"" that he would have to cut ""Goodbye Love."" This director should have stuck to what he knows rather than branch out. The only way this movie will be nominated for any Academy Awards is via the cast, who were brilliant, and maybe best picture, and the later is only if the academy members cast their votes while drunk. The redeeming factors were the cast, vocals, and some of the sets. Shame on the director and screenwriter for milling out such a gross misrepresentation of the original work and shame on the Larson family for allowing money to damage such a beautiful legacy.",Rent

I think that it is a great classic. I just watched it and thought it was awesome. I meant to see it in theaters but I never got the chance. I will also confess that although I have never seen it on Broadway I think that the movie version was still great. It is especially amazing for me to see considering that it is from a generation before me but I don't think that it is dated at all. It all seemed so real to me and I could relate to every one of the characters even if I have never had the type of experiences that they have.

It definitely doesn't suit a majority.All in all, it was a great movie, with very nice performances by the original cast with the inclusion of Rosario Dawson as ""Mimi"" and ... um... the lady who played ""Joanne"". I was slightly afraid, having heard the movie soundtrack online, it is definitely not to par with the original cast soundtrack from 1996.(..?), but watching it on film made all the difference.I saw it in a theatre with 4 other people in it, I really hope other theatre kids and teenagers alike make an appearance at their local movie theaters, if we want to see more musicals on film, Rent and the upcoming The Producers need to be successful.I cried.",Rent

553,WickedPopGoddess,Rent...amazing,9,26 November 2005,"The movie started with the well known ""Seasons of Love"". ""Rent"" starts soon after, with just a little spoken bit taken almost directly from the Broadway show's ""Tune Up #1"". I love the touch of all the tenants singing directly to Benny, including Mimi and Angel. Mimi and Roger seeing each other before ""Light My Candle"" is a great touch so she doesn't appear to knock on his door on accident.""You'll See"" was, of course, greatly pulled off by Taye Diggs, and soon after we cut to Angel playing the ten gallon plastic pickle tub before running into the beat up Tom Collins (and many who know the music might have found it painfully hard to listen to ""You Okay Honey"" spoken, as well as any songs spoken).The songs all pass very well acted, but what really grabs your attention is Collins entering yelling ""Merry Christmas, bitches!"" And then, of course, the part that turned Angel into my favorite character, ""Today 4 U"", which has the most amazing drum solo I might add. But when I saw if for the second time, I was mad to see that some annoying, preppy kids laughed when Angel came in all her Santa drag glory.I'll skip to ""Over the Moon"", in which RENTheads and non-RENTheads alike were laughing, a brilliant performance by Idina Menzel. ""La Vie Boheme"" got everyone laughing, too, especially my friends when we all yelled ""MUCHO MASTRABATION!""The second act also has many humorous lines added in with lines like, ""You're drunk!"" ""No I'm not!"" and various others. But you definitely start crying with clips of Angel dieing and Mimi getting worse in ""Without You"" and then the funeral scene. All of those who were worried by the clip in the trailer of Maureen's monologue in the scene; never fear. She pulls it off with great emotion, but everyone was crying even more during ""I'll Cover You: Reprise"". Sadly, they decided to cut out ""Halloween"" and most of ""Goodbye, Love"".Of course, I cried again in ""What You Own"" after you see clips of Angel before she died. Then everyone cried when Mimi was about to die, even those who knew the ending.The memorial to Jonathon Larson was simple and great; they couldn't put it any better.

Those two statements standing, I actually found this rendition of Rent offensive.I've have always found Broadway Rent performances to be done in good taste.

In fact, this movie is the first time I've ever actually seen the alluded vulgarities ""acted out."" So, I must admit, that I was quite embarrassed to have invited several church friends to partake in what I thought would be a classic, tasteful film version of my beloved musical. Just how Mr. Hollywood escaped the scarlet ""R"" rating is beyond me.For those of you who are offended by the fact that I would find offense to the movie, let me assure you that I did enjoy seeing the original cast, the music was phenomenal, and overall I do believe that Jonathan Larson would be prouddespite the overly lewd portrayal of his characters.",Rent
556,Little_Sultana,Transfers Better-Than-Expected onto Screen,9,20 November 2005,"I would have given it 8.5 if I could have, but I decided to just round up. I saw an advance screening, and went in thinking that it wouldn't and couldn't possibly approach the level of magnitude that the musical bestowed. However, I was proved wrong. If looked at as a movie, simply, and without comparing it to the Broadway show, then it was outstanding film despite its flaws.Most of the original cast as drafted, with the exceptions of Rosario Dawson as exotic dancer/HIV+ Mimi (Daphne Ruben Vega, the original Mimi, was noticeable pregnant at the time of filming) and Tracie Thoms, Harvard-graduated lawyer and lesbian (Fredie Walker, the original Joanne, was deemed too old for the part). The original cast members are as follows: Adam Pascal as ex-junkie, HIV+, rocker Roger Davis; Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, Roger's roommate who is a struggling filmmaker and (mostly) the narrator of the story; Tony-award winner Idina Menzel as bisexual Maureen Johnson, a drama queen and activist; Law and Order's Jesse L. Martin as HIV+ MIT/NYU computer-age philosophy professor Tom Collin; Tony-award winner Wilson Jermaine Heredia as the AIDS-afflicted drag queen with whom Collins is in love, Angel; and Benjamin ""Benny"" Coffin III played by Taye Diggs. All have dabbled in film, and therefore know how to act around cameras. Voices have changed, matured, from either more training, as in Idina Menzel's case, or smoking as in Adam Pascal's case, but none have diminished. The raw emotion is present, the music has been altered slightly here and there but nothing major, and the ever-wandering camera shots are wonderful.Some complaints one could have would be that, on screen, the story is a bit too juvenile, a bit too melodramatic, and some of the thematic elements that are perfectly presentable on stage show their patched-up corners on screen. Additionally, some of the grit has been lost in order to make a PG-13 movie, though a typical PG-13 movie it is not. This is not the type of movie that one could bring preteens nor adolescents under the specified age unless their maturity is high enough to openly accept alternate lifestyles, drugs issues, and various references throughout the movie to things that could otherwise go over their heads.The choreography, however, and the emotion is there, and all makes for a pretty enjoyable time.

558,MsDeTamble,A story that has molded a generation...,10,29 August 2006,"Rent is one of the greatest all time stories of love, life, and loss.This film is an adaptation of the Broadway musical based loosely on Puccini's opera ""La Bohème."" It follows a year in the lives of eight friends living the disappearing Bohemian lifestyle in New York's East Village. AIDS and both its physical and emotional complications pervade the lives of Roger, Mimi, Collins, and Angel; Maureen deals with her chronic infidelity through performance art; her partner, Joanne, wonders if their relationship is worth the trouble; Benny has sold out his Bohemian ideals in exchange for a hefty income and is on the outs with his former friends; and Mark, an aspiring filmmaker, feels like an outsider to life in general, always behind the camera recording the events but never playing a part.An emotional powerhouse, this movie leaves you feeling. Simply feeling. Every minute of the story is wrought with emotion, from immense happiness to heart wrenching sadness.Not only is the emotional ride as rigorous and enthralling as the greatest of roller coasters but the message is equally powerful. Angel, the lovable drag queen teaches all of her friends to live, and to love living. ""Forget regret, or life is yours to miss"" the central theme and message of the story. If you spend your time regretting the past you won't have time to live the future, after all everyone has a limited amount of time. Just because your time might be shorter than others' doesn't mean that you still can't get the very most out of your remaining days. Roger and Mimi fall deeply in love, despite their reservations. Benny, as a result of the near death of Mimi learns the value of the friendships he had. Mark, must learn not to fear being alone but to bask in the time he has with those he loves. Collins must live on spreading the love and message that Angel had so desperately tried to show his friends before her death. Joanne and Maureen are wrapped into the story by their love and devotion (however wavering on Maureen's part) not only to each other but to their friends as well.The relationships themselves are enough to make this one of the most moving stories ever written, but the music and cinematography add a spice that will make it hard for anyone to forget the raw emotion and feeling this movie induces.",Rent
559,tickledpinksweety,Rent,10,18 February 2006,This was an excellent movie and was great performing by Adam Pascal and Rossiaro Dawson! This shows the some-what realness of living with HIV and drug problems!Chris Coumlbus did a fantastic job of putting Brodways play into a movie. I enjoyed all of the songs. For the most part the kept all the songs. The only thing I would have to say about Rent that is negative is that I think on some parts the actors could showed more feeling and compassion! But other than that this was an excellent movie. Most people i think who have seen this Broadway Production will enjoy this movie and think that Chris did a great job sticking to the first adaptation of the book! Again I really like all the actors but Adam Pascal and Rossiaro Dawson were excellent and I look forward for more movie from all the actors! I hope people can look past the fact that it shows homosexual relationships and see the realness of there problems! Rent this movie or buy it because it is worth it! This film is not suitable for children under the age of 13.,Rent
560,Manda12553,Great movie,10,2 March 2006,I loved this movie it made me cry and laugh and cry and laugh throughout the movie. It is about a group of people trying to survive AIDS and being able to actually live. They use love a lot in this movie to survive. A lot of people don't like this movie because of the relationships between the couples but you be the judge. If you love musicals i absolutely recommend this movie and i recommend you to see the musical on Broadway. I haven't seen it but i am planning on it. So watch this movie definitely and you guys can rate it good or bad but it wont change my opinion.So great movie Rosario was great and so was Tracie and the rest of the cast. Rosario had one of the best voices in my opinion and second was Adam.,Rent
561,midnightholly,Incredible,10,24 November 2005,"I just saw Rent last night, and all I can say is incredible. The moment the first chord of Seasons of Love played a big smile came across my face, and I could already tell I was going to love it. I saw the play, but for the first time the movie surpassed the play. There is so much more a movie can offer than a stage production. The setting was able to expand providing some great opportunities for scenes. The songs were performed with such energy that my foot started tapping in time with the music more than once. At the end of La Vie Boheme one silent clap escaped from me before I realized I was in a movie theater and wasn't supposed to clap after each song. The reason for all my excitement was because of the great job done by all the actors. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms did a wonderful job fitting in with the rest of the cast, don't be afraid their voices were amazing especially Tracie's. I felt emotionally drained after this movie. I laughed and cried when they did, you were able to experience what each and everyone of them was going through. When the end credits started to roll everyone in theater began applauding. That was the first time that every happened to me. When everyone in the entire theater applauds you know that the movie was something special. When I left the theater I had so much energy. All I wanted to do was dance and sing the songs at the top of my lungs. This was the first good movie I had seen in a long time. I left wanting more, and felt truly affected by it. This was a wonderful movie, do yourself a favor and see it.",Rent
562,Adam713,Rent,9,24 November 2005,"Okay, so I saw this movie the day it came out (Wednesday the 23rd). I was very surprised how few people were there. It was really weird. Anyway, when the movie started, I felt it took too long to start. They played the intro to ""Seasons of Love"" about 20 times before they actually sang. It really bothered me. Throughout the movie, there were 3 scenes that really stood out as amazing to me. One of which is ""Without You"". Wow. That's all I can say. It was so moving and it was a great way to film it. I saw it on stage and new it would be amazing in the movie, but I didn't know how much. The next amazing part was Angel's funeral. That was a very emotional scene. And although I am upset they cut ""Halloween"" and the 2nd part of ""Goodbye Love"", I can see why they did it. It just wouldn't have worked at all, in my opinion. The final scene which I found very moving was the last life support scene. Where very slowly, they all vanished. It was very powerful to watch. I think when they first showed the Life Support meeting, you picked out a member of the meeting who you liked the best and it moved you when they vanished. Very powerful. There were also 2 parts that bothered me. One of which was ""What You Own"". I thought it was very boring and hard to pay attention for. The same goes for ""I Should Tell You"". It was prolonged and could have been more than just walking in the snow. All in all, this movie was great. The audience sang, clapped, and even moo'd with the movie. And I had a great time. I can't wait until I see it again tomorrow. Good work to all who took part in this! ~ADAM~",Rent

The music in the movie sounded like karaoke versions of the songs... the singing was HORRIBLE, in my opinion.. Almost all of the actors looked too old for their parts, especially the guy who played Roger... he looked like Bon Jovi... They cut some really great songs, like ""Christmas Bells"" and ""We're Okay"" The voice mails were not sung, which was sort of lame... They cut out the ""tune up"" songs... The ones that were kept, were not sung.. It seemed as if they tried to make it ""artsy"", but they failed. And 90% of the movie was filmed in San Diego... Which makes NO sense to me.There's sooo much more I could say about it, but it's just getting me frustrated.When I got home, I just felt like I wasted money and time... Then I put on the original Rent soundtrack to wash my mind of that movie.Save your money, see Rent on Broadway. The movie was a waste.",Rent

I left the theater singing what i could remember from the music, which too was incredible. even if you're not a big fan of musicals, you'll love this! i even bought the DVD and soundtrack to the movie and i listen or watch them almost everyday. if you are a fan of dramatic, comedic or musical films, you will love this one. it shines with deep character involvement and a fully functioning story line. its great for all audiences!",Rent

I am pleading with everyone out here, even if you don't have any interest in this movie, give it a chance. I guarantee that you will love it just like everyone else. And for the people who have seen it. Why are ""Hallowwen"" and ""Goodbye Love"" not in the movie?

566,GreatHeil,Jonathan Larson would be furious,2,5 July 2006,"This comment will be going widely against every other opinion on this movie. But it is well-deserved. Being a rent-head myself, I was very careful not to expect the stage show transferred to film. But what I got was SO far from it that I had to turn it off the first time I watched it. Blatant re-ordering of the song order. The complete trashing of the original plot development. And the cutting of two complete songs (Christmas Bells and Contact), not to mention large parts of others (the second part to ""Goodbye Love"" when Mimi goes into rehab and Roger and Mark have their argument. That was the icing on the cake for me.) The spoken scenes were horribly done. When they weren't struggling to make rhyming phrases sound plausible, they were struggling to make horribly simple original lines sound plausible. The whole scene with Alexi Darling was completely unnecessary. I have no idea why they put Seasons of Love at the very beginning AND at the beginning of the second part. As far as the music goes, it was good. When they stuck to what Jonathan Larson wrote. Many of the songs were done in a different key. They re-wrote much of the accompaniment, even going as far as to compose new music for something that already had music written for it. The mixing was terrible. Most of the time one part was drowning out the rest of it, most notably the finale when the piano comes through to signal the final lyric. The casting of Adam Pascal was mistaken. He did a great job in the original.. but something happened to his voice and he cannot sing the way he could then and should have been passed up for a different actor. The music and video were clashing through the entire film. Most of the time it felt like watching a music video, I couldn't even pretend that they were actually singing. Today 4 U simply sucked. And most of the other songs were ruined by the singer's irrational need to make it their own. Vocal improvisation is good.. when it's called for, which most of the time it wasn't.It wasn't really a bad film. My low rating and anger stem from the mutilation of the original. I don't expect the original intact on screen. But I do expect it to be given respect. Which it wasn't.",Rent
567,brittacarlberg,Interesting themes and one or two nice scenes but unfocused and boring mostly...,3,5 November 2016,"Well, i think i just understood my own taste in musicals a tiny bit better!My best guess for this movie is that it might help to have seen the stage play? For i myself went in blindfolded and boy did i trip on the way through... First the good stuff; i kinda liked the guy playing Roger. The character was unappealing to me - too whiny and brooding for my taste - but the actor did have a voice that i liked and he felt like the only one of the cast that put in emotion and power in his singing. I had an unpleasant feeling with the rest of them, like they were more interested in looking pretty and singing beautifully than conveying emotion, but this one kinda nailed it for me. - Joanne was great too. Good actress, beautiful voice, appealing character, and i have to mention, smoking hot. I liked her! - I liked three of the songs. Not bad for this one! I usually have a painful time trying to find music i like. - The sets were kinda nice in two or three places, especially the main apartment.Angel was a great character that i knew all too little about. The relationship between him and the guy with the hat and the Santa Fe- song was beautiful, despite a lack of buildup. I liked him, but had too little time with him to connect fully with the guy. - The theme. I love the idea to explore the world of bohemians, of unconventional people, of people with aids and how they deal with it emotionally - here thrown into a blender with music to make a movie with endless possibilities! The not so good stuff...1. Most of the songs felt bland and boring to me, with insanely uninteresting choreography and settings, performed by actors that did not put in all that much passion in it all. I felt like that all the way through the movie, with exception for the ""One song glory"" - the cold metal, huge city and desolate roof matched the theme of the song beautifully. But as for the rest... i'll give an example. Sorry, girl - showing your face between another girls legs and glaring at strangers is not empowering or meaningful here. It could have been, with some buildup - make those strangers explicit homophobes for example, not just random old white guys with money. In this context, it was mostly like a seventeen year old girl proclaiming ""I am complex, you know! Look, i can even touch and kiss other girls! I am a girl whom likes girls! Those lesbian people only kiss other girls to get men turned on, right? Did i mention i was complex?!"" 2. Most of the characters were bland, stupid, selfish or otherwise annoyed me. I guess Maureen was supposed to be somewhat likable but i kinda wished for her to die in a car accident all the way through... i got the impression of a selfish ... that was all too happy to have other people do everything for her. Get a job and get your head out of your backside, lady. Oh, and Joanne, God - you deserve so much better! Most of the others lacked any kind of grounded personality, so all i had left was my annoyance at those whining slackers.3. The overall message. I am a bit of a hippie myself but by god - Boo Hoo, we are being evicted after living rent free for two years, but screw you in the end because we do not need your charity, we are artists! Artists that haven't produced anything in over a year... GET A JOB YOU LAZY MORONS!!! The message kinda made me angry, yes... 4. A complete absence of any kind of red thread. So.. you saw your friend beneath your window, gave him the key, and show only slight annoyance at the fact that he then disappears for 14 hours? Alright, so you people know each other i guess... and i do not get any kind of emotional connection between a single one of you, you just tell me verbally how you feel about each other. Alright... I guess this Angel guy was the glue that kept all of you together even though you have never shown us that in any way. Sure... By they way, most of you have aids or are HIV-positive. It would have been kinda nice if you had established that Angel was further down the path to death than the rest of you, that way my reaction to his death might have been something more than ""Eh?"" 5. The songs were just... songs. In Wicked, Defying gravity is a powerful moment were Elphabas desires, frustration and situation finally streams out in a beautiful, powerful and inspiring scene. In Les Miserables, Who am i? is a song where Jean Valjean has to put the peace of his soul and his newfound good nature against his fear of once again going to prison. In Rent, well, some of the songs show how the characters feel - without any kind of buildup, making them lack any kind of punch or emotional impact for my part. My reaction varied from ""Okay?"" to ""What the holy Broadway?"" It is not enough for me to see Angel, April or anyone for that matter die - if i do not get a buildup, i will not react to it. And what the... was up with that candle lighting-song? 6. All around, huge wasted opportunity. A musical about a deadly tragic illness, love, trans and gay persons in the 80s, the bohemian life style. This could have been amazing. But for the reasons above, this whole thing completely misses the point for my part.",Rent

In my humble opinion there was not enough music. Many of my favorite parts of the musical are just that; MUSICAL.The characters were well played although a few could have been easily removed without affecting the story.All in all I gave it a 6 for the story line but I sincerely doubt it will rake in nearly what they were expecting at the box office.Everyone else I have talked to adored it. Oh well, different strokes I guess.Hope this helps.",Rent
569,dlkbc,Still prefer stage 'Rent' over movie 'Rent' spoilers,7,21 November 2005,"Just saw an advanced screening of Rent tonight. I was totally prepared to be very critical of every little thing since I was such a fan of the original NY cast and the touring casts. (Yes, I camped out once in NY to get $20 tickets). I was appalled when I heard that the original 'Mimi' would not be in the movie and was perplexed when I heard that Rosario Dawson of all people would be Mimi. I must say that she was better than I expected her to be and at times she looked totally like a heroin addict, that it was scary! But still wonder whether Daphne would have been better. I didn't seem to feel the chemistry between her and Roger that the others have been saying... What I criticize the most about the movie is the lack of a lot of the phone message banter that the play had. Although I liked Sarah Silverman as Lexi Darling (as brief as it was), they could have had the scene when she leaves all the numbers on his machine which was hilarious in the play. The party scene with Maureen and Joanne given by her parents--would never had happened in 1989. Remember the fuss that happened when Ellen Degeneres came out--and that was the 90s?! They could have done the musical number in a different scene--something more of the era. The new Joanne has such a soulful and wonderful voice--ably taking over the role and able to hold her own amongst these other Broadway talents! My favorite song of the movie was Jesse L Martin--any of them! Although I am glad that most of the original cast was in the movie,at times they all looked a little old for their roles--it has been almost ten years after all--at times they do look in their 30s--hard to buy in those roles. On stage you don't notice the aging so much but on a big screen and with close ups?! Rosario Dawson did not look like a 19 year old though I guess being a heroin addict will make you look older. What's with the snow scene where Mimi and Roger are singing to each other? The snow looked so fake--big feathery flakes that never melt when they hit their face. I would see it again,if just to see the big musical numbers again--the Tango Maureen and the Cafe scene especially.",Rent

Now Columbus movies are touch-and-go and always have been, but for some reason I thought this would be different. Boy was I mislead. Except for the unceasing vitality, energy, and dedication of the movie cast, including newcomers Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms, the movie was a nostalgic miss. Larson's music - though much is left out or reworked (BIG MISTAKE) - brought to life by actors who, more than anyone know what Larson's original meaning was, is the only thing that kept this movie afloat. Otherwise it was an uneventful and boring showcase of bad camera choices, and non-existent direction. Boo, Columbus! I only wish a better, more experienced director could have taken this project under his/her wing - it had the potential to be this year's CHICAGO or MOULIN ROUGE. Instead, it's a wishy-washy wannabe. Oh well. If anything, hopefully it will generate rather than mislead a brand-new generation of Rentheads. Here's a tip, kids: see the show. THEN watch the movie.

571,mach3415,The Emotions of Rent,10,27 November 2005,"I am not a cinematographic geek. I am not a director. I am not a film buff or a hardcore Rent head. I am, however, a human being. I can honestly say that no movie has touched my life and hit so close to home on that emotional, personal level ever.The message of Rent is one of living and loving unconditionally. Love is shown in all it's forms: romantic, friendly, homo and heterosexual. It portrays the acceptance of love as the all important factor that makes up happy. Love is what gives us purpose. The AIDS scare may be waning, but love, my friends, love is what we need. Love is how they measure a year in. Love is the force that holds through drugs, poverty, riot, and even death.In the funeral, when the cast reprises I'll Cover You, the unbridled emotion and pure feeling of loss is so thick that there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Rent may not be the best movie in the realm of cinematography or production or even casting, but the message of the story, underneath the urban 1989 backdrop, is the unchanging importance of love.

However, it is set in New York City 1989-1990, and it's the slums. So, there are drugs, strip clubs, and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome aka AIDS involved. But, just as a warning there are 2 gay men, and 2 lesbian women.It has the original cast from when it first opened on Broadway, except for two women (caracter names Joanne and Mimi). However, their replacements did an amazing job in the rolls they played, and deserve awards! By now you're probably wondering how someone could make a movie musical out of what I've told you so far. Well, it's all Rock music, so none of it is like the old fashioned musicals. It's got electric guitars, bases, drums like no other, key boards, and some more orchestral instruments too. Mostly, however, it's rock.I have to admit, I cried... hard, but it was sad. However, it was hilarious at the same time! However, be fore warned that there is bisexual kissing, not to mention swear words (but, I doubt you care about those). It's an emotional roller-coaster like you wouldn't believe!

When I look back, I see that I indeed did measure my past year in ways different than the years before. One major way I measured this past year was, in fact, with Rent. Every three months for the pat year exactly, I've had a new marker - getting introduced to the musical, hearing rumours abouts its release as a movie, confirmation of those rumours, the official website, the theatrical premiere, and now, finally, getting to see it on DVD. I must say, it was everything I had hoped for.The music I already knew was spectacular, but when I saw the movie, I bonded with the characters so much I feel like they were MY friends. The adaptation was magnificent, and the storyline is so real - things that happen everyday to real people, to people like me and my friends. There is no doubt that this is going to be on my shelf soon. The casting was awesome (Adam Pascal? I will watch anything if he's in it!) All the actors gave terrific and very realistic performances, and the tone of the movie was fantastic. The message was striking, and it's a movie that I will never forget.

The opening sequence after ""Seasons of Love"" was just as wonderful spoken as it was set to music. I am sorry they took out ""Halloween"" and ""Goodbye Love"" but I think to take a story from the stage to the big screen you have to leave out, or change, just enough to make it a little different. The music in this movie is both powerful and poignant. It could not have been done any better. As one who has LOVED this musical for about eight years and has never been able to see it on stage, THANK YOU CHRISTOHPER COLUMBUS and REVOLUTION STUDIOS! I have waited so long. I am so glad you used the original cast as well. I don't think it would have been as good with anyone else playing the roles that they originated. Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson melded so well with this cast. If we couldn't have the original Mimi and Joanne then you hit the jackpot with their replacements.",Rent

And just to let you know, this is coming from a die-hard Potter fan. But seriously, I've seen Rent 3 times before in my life: twice on Broadway and once in the theaters. It's still one of the most real stories of city life in New York; the struggles, the passion, and of course the music. To my surprise, Chris Columbus did a terrific job with the film. I wasn't very pleased by the way he did the first and second Potter movies, but his adaptation of this well-known musical changed my whole image of him. I think the most beautiful scene that was in the movie, was the last one and as Mark plays his documentary, at the end of it you see Angel and the screen just fades to black. That scene really touched me. Especially after Angel's death, it was a sort of hope that, ""Yes, he is still here with us"" type of thing. You really got a sense of who all the characters were right from the beginning from the most part. And if you were really into it, you could feel each of the characters emotions, their pain or their joy.

577,bookdrop2000,No day but today,8,25 November 2005,"I must say, I came into the movie with an open mind. Being a fan of theatre and an actress myself, I understood that there would be differences from stage to film. Luckily, I had no idea what the stage version of ""Rent"" looked like. To be honest, I heard the music for the first time this summer.As the movie opened with ""Seasons of Love"" and the eight standing on a stage, I thought it was an excellent transition from stage to film. As the story began, with Mark riding his bicycle singing ""Rent"", I was immersed and began to feel an intimate emotion for each of the characters. The camera work was astonishing, being practical as well as artful in the way it pans to Mark and Roger's apartment and the entire street burning their eviction notices truly made me want to stand up and shout ""DOWN WITH THE MAN!"". I refrained though, seeing as I was in the front row and had another two and a half hours left to watch it.As the film continued, I noticed one thing that would distinguish itself from any stage performance. Intimacy. You could see Mark's face as he had to accept his job at Buzzline. You could see Joanne's pain as Maureen continued to flirt. But, most tragically, you could see Collins pain as he held Angel in the Subway. These scenes, with Larson's music and dialog, was enough to bring anyone to emotional heartache. My mascara was definitely running as Maureen said, ""You always said how lucky you were that we were all friends. But it was us, baby, who were the lucky ones."" Overall, the production was excellent. The best scenes in the movie would be ""Tango Maureen"" which was brilliantly done half in real-life and half in Mark's head when he was knocked out. The next best would be ""La Vie Boheme"" which just made me want to get up and dance around. Once again, the urge to shout ""FIGHT THE MAN!"" but my friend kept his hand on my wrist so that I wouldn't go crazy. The raw emotional connection is so insane. Everyone can connect with the death of a loved one with Angel's death. Everyone can connect with the friendship that overcomes hard times. I would give half my arm for a friend to come in on Christmas saying, ""Merry Christmas, bitches!"" Well, maybe not my arm, but it is certainly a blessing that many would love to have. Especially when that someone eventually re-wires the ATM for anyone who knows the password.The only thing bad about this movie might be the amount of singing. I'm a HUGE theatre and musical fan, so this didn't bother me. However, my friend went in not knowing that it was a musical, and came out going, ""Okay. That was the longest two hours of my life."" My friend next to me also began to become antsy, but was severely interested in the story plot. In other words, the movie isn't for all, but it's definitely worth your time to invest in. After all, ""there's no day but today.""",Rent

579,NwYrkNwRlns,"""Rent"" is a must-see.",10,24 November 2005,"This movie was absolutely amazing. Everything from the talented singing to the bold topics Larson covered when he wrote this. ""Rent"" tackles everything from homosexuality to bisexuality to cross-dressing to AIDS. The movie ranges from joyous, laughing moments to tear-jerking ones (the person sitting next to me was still crying when we walked out.) This movie really raises awareness and tolerance levels. I would see it again in a heart beat. I do, however, think the rating is misleading. Although it says PG-13, they include the f-word quite a few times, and songs mentioned things such as ""S&M"", ""dildos"", and other sexual references. Songs, such as ""La Vie Boheme"", may have been racy, but were still the best and truly described a modern Bohemia. Idina Menzel (who plays Maureen Johnson, and is of ""Wicked"" fame) shows just what her vocal chords are capable of in ""Over the Moon"". Tracie Thoms (who plays Joanne) made a previously shadowed character into a strong, front-and-center woman, especially shown in ""Tango:Maureen"" and ""Take Me or Leave Me"". Rosario Dawson was phenomenal in the role of Mimi, really adding major depth to the dancer, showing both her sexy front and her hidden fears in ""Out Tonight"". Wilson Jermaine Heredia truly gave meaning to his character's name Angel, but still kept things fast and surprising in ""Today 4 U"". Jesse L. Martin (Collins) provided what was probably the most excruciatingly heart-breaking few minutes of the movie in his reprise of ""I'll Cover You."" Adam Pascal unlocked the scars of Rogers past in both ""One Song Glory"" and ""Another Day"". And of course, Anthony Rapp really showed the rebellious side of Mark in the hit ""La Vie Boheme"".

580,TopherStanley,didn't have the magic of the stage version...,1,9 December 2005,"for the most part, my dislike of the movie is due to bad direction on the part of Chris Columbus. for those who have seen the stage version, you may find that the musical numbers have lost their magic; words and even entire phrases lose meaning due to poor cinematography choices or changes in the blocking and/or interpretation of the song. certain dialogue has been removed, but the musical underscore for that dialogue was kept in (which was specifically written to underscore that dialogue!). this left certain musical cues feeling unfinished or missed. i enjoyed the concept of the adaption, but the execution of it felt rushed, misguided, and all together not well planned. it just didn't match up to the stage version of the show.",Rent
581,lei1280,Amazing!,10,28 November 2005,"I am a little biased being that I have seen the Broadway show 5 times, but I thought Chris Columbus did a great job. I, as many, was concerned with the ""Home Alone"" director to take the helm of this project. Yes, the songs were tweaked a bit, but that's only expected since the show really has no set. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking to enjoy 2 hours. Great music from a genius (Jonathan Larson) and great cast!I was also a little unsure of Rosario Dawson being cast as Mimi but since Daphne Rubin-Vega was pregnant and could not reprise her original role, Rosario did a good job. I think it was important to have the original cast members in this production. Many people had no idea that Jesse L. Martin could sing or got his start on Broadway. But DAMN! the man can sing! Great movie!!",Rent

I had seen the musical several times and didn't think the movie could live up to the play. I was mistaken, the movie was incredible!!!! I wanted to clap after every number and I cried just as much as I did when I watched the play. This movie did not hide the fact that it was a musical, the characters would break into song walking down the street, in the subway or at a restaurant. I did hear some people discussing the film afterwords saying that they had to hold in laughter every time a character started to randomly sing. I must say it was a little weird though knowing every line of a movie the first time you see it. If you are a huge Rent fan like myself and know the original CD by heart you will find yourself talking and singing along with the film. This movie is a solid 10 and truly lives up to the musical.",Rent
584,omg-zilla,honesty.,9,23 November 2005,"a very, very good rendition of the long-running musical Rent. A lot of the singing is changed into dialog, and the time line is moved around a bit, but for the most part they make it work. the original cast does well in their roles on screen. they don't even seem awkward with the transition from the stage to the screen. the movie stays incredibly honest to the musical, which all hardcore Rent fans appreciate.downfalls: the musical sequences are (at points) strange and somewhat out of place. at one point Roger (aids+, depressed lover) finds his way to Santa Fe and sings an entire sequence in the desert, walking in tight jeans, a loose shirt, and cowboy boots. at that point it does become a bit ridiculous. also, the ending (which i dare not reveal) is a bit silly when put on film. but it works in the long run.heroin use, gay sex, and rock and roll.its good, though. it resonates.",Rent

I am a huge fan and had even booked tickets to see it in New York on the 11th before they cancelled the early release. I had been waiting and waiting for it, eagerly listening to the soundtrack until I was so excited I nearly burst. Anyways, the movie did not disappoint. Much more edgier and visual than the play, the movie will appeal to any viewer, even those totally uninterested in the subject matter. The acting was spectacular, with the performances of newbies Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms really sticking out in my mind, they did a great job. Also, the chemistry between Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Jesse L. Martin was fantastic, I can only hope to find a love as great as theirs. Anthony Rapp and Adam Pascal made a perfect team, and Idina Menzel hasn't aged a day. Finally, Taye Diggs was the perfect bad guy, his performance was also stellar. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone over the age of 15.

You could really feel the love these people had for each other and it showed in their performances.

588,whuling,Over-hyped and Underscripted,5,28 November 2005,"I must admit that I a not a long time fan of the musical Rent, and I went into this film blind. I do have passing knowledge of the musical genre, so I feel free to comment anyways. First off, I found the score to be haphazard. There are certainly powerful songs throughout, but these are paired with songs that fall into the old musical vice of too many syllables per line. Which leads me to my next point; was Chris Colombus afraid to have dialogue in the movie? A previous poster praised the director for making this film as a musical and not straying from the roots, but the result is a hollow story. Angel, for instance, is merely a foil for the classic heart-of-gold-with-a-terminal-illness cliché. He has two songs and almost no meaningful lines, which makes his anticipated death, which occurs in a montage no less, feeling empty. At his funeral the characters tel stories about him, none of which correspond to anything we have seen. If Halloween was his favorite holiday, perhaps there could have been a scene or so from the night. Hmmmm? My last major complaint is that this film isn't really a film. It is an amalgm of musical montages separated by never more than a minute or five of dialogue and action. THAT Isn't FILM! To all directors, when you decide to make a musical please watch the classical musical films in order to see how it works. Music Video is not equal to Musical.",Rent
589,Zgirl522,One of the steps to showing America what real love is.,10,4 September 2006,"I don't know how to even explain the beauty of this musical that is now a movie. Having it on screen has made it so much more real to me and it entrances me all the more. I love what RENT stands for and the people who express themselves in it. I love how the people who play these characters had lives very similar to their characters and though they are not their characters, I feel as if they are an extension of themselves while playing the roles. I think Jonathan would have been proud that his dream will live forever on celluloid. I really was upset when it was panned, but it still did pretty well in the box office and I watch it whenever I can to remind myself about how to treat and enjoy life everyday. My friends loved the movie and the musical and I for one cannot compare on to the other because although they have the same plot, they have different ways of going about it. In the musical, you see things and have to use your imagination for venue of certain scenes. You can feel the raw emotion. On screen you still feel emotion, but now you can see where things take place, be up close to these characters faces when a lover dies or when a riot occurs and you can really see in their eyes, that happiness, pain or sorrow. I love both movie and musical and could not have been much happier with the outcome.",Rent
590,hanewpor,Don't Pay for RENT,3,24 November 2005,"I had the misfortune of seeing this movie last night. It was terrible. I'm sure Mr. Larson was turning over in his grave. I feel sorry for the 6 original cast members. I am certain that they had no idea how awful the production would be when they signed the contracts. The screenwriter should be shot. Who takes a musical, cuts out the music and makes the lyrics spoken? It sounds stupid without the context of the music. Also, many times the background music is so loud you can't hear what the actors are singing. Was this an attempt to mask the fact that the songs were sung out of order and didn't follow the plot of the movie? The director must think audiences are stupid. The cheesy, pop video style of many of the scenes, especially ""I'll Cover You"" , looked more like Mtv of the late 80's or some foreign language video I would have watched in French class. Many of the scenes felt like dream sequences. I know they were meant to give depth to the story line, but they were just dumb. If the movie had followed the original script, they wouldn't have been necessary. Rosario Dawson doesn't work as Mimi. She is too breathy and soulful. The original Mimi is younger and more pathetic. In the film version I never understood why I should hate Benny. He seems like a pretty nice guy. The other cast members look stupid for not taking him up on his offer to live rent free. This film has a few qualities that made it not a total waste. The Life Cafe scene was very much like the musical version, but that's about it. The six original cast members did an excellent job. The two new ones were mis-cast. Hello...Joann was a robust woman and now she's what? a size 6? Give me a break! Oh, and if you loved the answering machine messages from the play...forget it. They aren't there. Why is Buzzline so sleazy? Gee, after seeing the movie I don't know. Bottom line...don't waste your time seeing this movie.

They also have made a terrible attempt to remove lyrics, and then create dialogue in place.The musical RENT is raw, hard, original and full of suspense.

Angel is great his/her well lets just say Angel reminds me of how my friend Seth is so supportive of all his friends ideas and encourages us to do what we want to the best of our ability.

I had seen the stage version both in NYC with the original cast as well as in LA with a different cast. The music and story has been echoing in my head for the past 10 years. So I was bound to be critical, but determined to be open-minded as this was going to be a film, not a stage musical. Chris Columbus did a wonderful job in preserving the message and feelings Jonathan Larson I think wanted people to take away with them. The changes made to bring this story to the screen were artfully accomplished. The film is gritty and sad and has a feeling of hopelessness that was difficult to transmit in a stage venue. The music that made it into the film is spectacular, and the soundtrack is indeed better than the OBC recording. The loss of several songs, though at first disappointing, works in the context of the movie. I hope all you fellow 'Rentheads' give this film the chance it deserves. I will be in the theater on opening day next week to see it again for sure.",Rent

And Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thomas both pulled off their role successfully. Sensational singing from all. For those who may have not seen the Broadway-musical version of RENT, I recommend seeing the movie still. It's storyline and message will definitely will make you want to see the stage production version.

Also, there was really no emotional connection with the characters; they came and went so fast. Its a risk taking a stage show to the film medium; sometimes its a hit, sometimes its a miss.

But even so, the two actors who played Joanne and Mimi are well deserved of praise from audiences all over with their amazing voices! Some people who have seen Rent on stage may be disappointed that some songs were taken out or changed to better fit with the movie, but this was done to make it seem more real, and I think that it works in that way.

607,curly65,fear not you fellow Rent heads,9,21 November 2005,"When Rent first opened on Broadway in 1996 I was about 12. I remember receiving the CD as a gift from my parents. As a teenager, my friends and I thought that Rent was our lives too. We learned every word to every song, saved out money to go and see the show on Broadway, and dreamed that one day we would be on that stage too. Alas, none of us made it to the stage but our love of the show continued, so when I heard the film version was finally being made, I was ecstatic. My ecstasy turned to panic soon. Would it be the same, would it still have the same meaning now, 10 years later? Directed by Chris Columbus (Harry Potter, Home Alone), the film stars most of the original cast members. Columbus does a wonderful job of not tampering with the original gritty feel and aesthetic of New York at the end of the millennium. The cast has had time and distance to perfect the roles they originated on Broadway. Most notably Idina Menzel as the lesbian performance artist Maureen. Her performance art piece is perfection now with a campier less serious feel to it. Jessie L. Martin's Tom Collins feels more real now too. Not saying he wasn't always great in the role, but film allows his acting abilities to really shine. Though there are obvious problems with the musical, that had been there from it's inception, but the audience can't help but connect to the characters. The universal themes of living life to the fullest and as there is ""No day but today,"" are still there and haven't lost any of their poignancy. Columbus doesn't gloss over the musical's gritty portrayal of AIDS, drugs, and sex. This film is a tough sell. Audiences are not used to musicals like this. Chicago was set in a dream world where the musical numbers where easier to swallow. Rent is not, the actors sing out loud as though it was normal. Hopefully, audiences will connect to the story, and suspend their belief.So in summary, fear not you fellow Rent heads, the film version, is a loyal adaptation of the stage version, and maybe a new generation of 12 year old's will make this film their own too.",Rent

Rent fans will love it, a perfect adaption to the big screen. They do cut out some songs but the plot is perfect they didn't need those extra ones.

It isn't Citizen Kane, but it is a GREAT movie and certainly one of the best movie musicals in years. There are a few poorly constructed shots and a few instances where you want to look at something other than what the camera lets you see. These things would be hindrances in a bad movie, but this film has so many wonderful things going for it. Aside from having a great score (I liked all the songs, and LOVED more than half of them)and an engaging plot, you have an amazing cast. I don't know who these people are (the only person I had seen before was Rosario Dawson) but they're amazing! Every actor did a phenomenal job bringing out the character and making them real. I hope this movie opens up new opportunities for them, because they were all incredible. My favorites were Mimi, Angel, and Maureen.The story is touching and poignant, the issues still relevant, and the themes timeless and universal. Again, from a film-making perspective there are several blunders, but I'm giving this movie a 9.5 out of 10 for the acting, brilliant music, a great message, and great entertainment value. I can't get the ""La Vie Boheme"" song out of my head and plan to see this movie again and again. And I will definitely but the soundtrack. Highly Recommended!",Rent

The cinematography was very cheesy. I wanted to leave 20 mins after because it seemed to drag and it did not keep me interested or excited. The only thing that kept me there is because I spent $9.00. plus food. Adam Pascals voice did not seem as powerful as it has in the theater productions of Rent and Aida. Of course you can not sound the same on film as you do in the theater but the should have hired voice coaches. Adam unfortunately sounded flat and it seemed like he was struggling to sing. I'm not even going to discuss his hair cut. I felt that was sad because Adam was my favorite Roger. Besides that a lot of scenes did not make any sense. For instance at the commitment ceremony Joanne and Maureen were fighting and then they broke up. What is with the the commitment ceremony anyway? Why did Mr. Columbus feel it was important to include that the year was 1989? Thelma and Louis didn't come out to 1991. There was just a lot of silliness. I wonder if anyone reviewed the movie prior to the release and if so how could they have been OK with it? C.Columbus had great material and did not know what to do with it. Best bet would be to professionally record the theater production. I waited a long time for this movie, truly disappointing",Rent
613,nikirush,Skeptic converted,9,23 November 2005,"RENT was absolutely dazzling. Not in a glitzy kind of way but in a real, tangible, and vibrant way. I had very low expectations for what the film adaptation of RENT would be. I've seen the musical various times around the country and even while traveling in London and loved it each time and the nuance of each cast. I just was not prepared to experience any of the emotion conveyed in person to exist in a movie theatre. After seeing it, I wholly admit I was totally wrong.The film has taken the RENT experience to another level. It just seemed to ""fit"" (for lack of a better word). I don't want to include any spoilers but I will say that although the movie does not follow the musical exactly, you will appreciate the parts that are changed in lieu of the overall film.I would say that theatre was brought to the people via this film. I took along my 17 year old brother, who had not seen the musical previously. We were discussing the movie afterwards and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. We talked about times when we laughed and cried (well, I cried) and were inspired. That was a cool experience in itself. To leave a movie and discuss story line and plot and emotion, not what was the biggest explosion and best fight scene.I would highly recommend this movie to any who asks.",Rent
614,unique388,Very Nice Rendition of Broadway Hit!,8,23 November 2005,"The RENT movie, created directly from the play, does an excellent job of staying to the script and being accurate to its purpose. This is good for all the RENTheads out there. It tells the powerful story with even more emotion added because of the film angles and individuality of each character. I liked this movie mainly because of the adaptation to screen but I encourage all who haven't seen the play to watch the movie. In the fast paced script, the songs seem to have even more purpose and the plot truly comes alive. While mostly made up of the Broadway originals, the new actors have surprisingly good voices and do justice to the play. If you enjoy musicals from Broadway, but don't live in New York, this is for you. If you like an entertaining movie with an incredible plot line, this is also for you!",Rent
615,nc-dramaqueen-2007,Breath Taking,10,23 November 2005,"RENT, was absolutely fabulous. I was able to attend a Sneak Peak Screening 11-21-05. This is the only movie where the audience did the following: Cheered and Appauded at both the beginning and the end, bawled straight through the second half, sang along with the Finale, and while credits were rolling stood up and hugged those around them. RENT has such a special message about Love and Friendship. This depiction of Avenue B New York, with all of the Drugs, diseases, and poverty, but through it all still show the ability of friends to conquer it all no matter how hard it may be.

616,xrebellionxliesx,Lacked passion and accuracy,5,23 November 2005,"When I first heard talk that RENT was going to become a movie, I was scared out of my mind. Having seen it six times on Broadway, I felt an attachment to the musical that I thought might get butchered on screen. As I began to see trailers, I couldn't wait to see it... But then, on opening day I saw it and it was good... at best. There were a few things that really bothered me a lot about it: 1) Maureen and Joanne's relationship: Nowhere near as shaky as it was supposed to be. 2) Joanne: She was just too tiny; I need her to be more tough and independent. 3) I really didn't like how they took some lines from the songs and made them into dialogue. I think that it lost something that way. One example: ""December 24th, 9pm Eastern Standard Time..."" was said, not sang. 4) I really didn't like how they took some songs and scenes out and added some new ones... Really, really lost something. (i.e. Joanne and Maureen getting married? When did that happen?! And ""Contact,"" where ever did that go?) 5) Some of the things were really corny (i.e. Roger in Santa Fe, what the hell were they thinking when they put that in the movie? During that part I just hung my head in embarrassment.) 6) They didn't let Benny redeem himself like they by paying for Angel's funeral, so that missed a whole dimension to his character. 7) The sound of the music, I felt lacked warmth and emotion. I also really felt very little connection to the characters because it seemed that they had very little connection with each other. But yeah, the scenes that were good were really good, like ""Today 4 U"" and ""La Vie Boheme"" because they both had the energy that the live show possessed, but a lot of the movie was really sub par. Overall, it just felt very watered down and trite. It made me sad.",Rent
617,tbondono,truly fantastic,10,23 November 2005,"This might be the first time a Broadway show has been put on film and is just as good, maybe even better, than the original show. GO SEE IT---OFTEN. I have been lucky enough to see RENT on the stage twice here in Detroit. The first time I saw the show, I was with my 17 year old daughter, she already loved the songs and after the show we both loved it. Seven years later, my younger daughter, 16 years old and also a singer like her older sister, she had listened to the CD over and over for years. When RENT came back to Detroit, she and I went to see it. Tonight, a year later, all three of us were able to see the show together. Columbus and the cast had the audience mesmerized from the moment the title was shown on the screen. The theatre was packed with other rent heads; but during the show, it was so quiet- none of the usual chitchat that seems so common in theatres. Engrossed-ya, that describes the atmosphere of the audience. The opening song with each actor under a spotlight, on the stage singing the opening number, artfully brought together the elements of the Broadway show into a successful movie. Personally, I wanted to stand and clap after each number. I'm still in awe that they were able to pull off having the actors singing while doing ordinary things. The singing never seemed out of place, even when Mark was peddling down the street. It's normal for friends to take over a restaurant, dance on tables, and belt out a song, right? Not in my real world, yet for a few hours I felt like I was a member of the cast, and of course my dancing on the table was normal. Maybe it is because I already knew the show so well, but the level of believability the actors brought to the script allowed the characters to come to life. The gritty feel of desperation found in almost any large city, whether New York, Detroit, or East LA, was successfully conveyed to the audience. When all the residents turned out on the iron balconies and stoops of deteriorating apartment buildings, all singing ""Rent"", I was (and still am) fascinated. I loved the small fires the tenants had with them, and the use of that prop, to me, really brought in a common denominator - poverty. Each shared the experience of being poor, trapped, but because they all shared in this experience, no one was really alone. I can't wait until tomorrow, I'm going again, this time with my partner. And I'm taking extra tissues! I will own this DVD! And remember-no day but today....",Rent

If you have seen the play you have a one up on everyone else when you go to the movie. For example, I took my sister who has never seen the play and had to explain to her who Roger's flashbacks were of, how April died, and some other points of the play. You also don't find out things that u do in the beginning of the play until later on in the movie.

619,boocyw,a complete emotional experience,10,23 November 2005,"Rent, what to say but wow. I was one of those people that when Rent was in it's hayday I thought that it was overblown, BS hype. If the play was half as good as this movie was, then I was an idiot. I just saw the movie about three hours ago and I can't stop thinking about it. The acting was incredible, pacing was terrific, story was engaging (to the point that my large popcorn - usually gone by the 40 minute mark of a movie - was still half full). From the first scene (just reached out to me in my seat and mesmerized me) to the last, I was having to remember to breathe. While all the actors where superb, Jesse L. Martin, my god this man can act and wow can he sing. I realize this role is where he got his start but kudos for him playing it on the big screen. Playing a gay character in Hollywood is either career suicide or a huge boost. If this man does not get an Ocsar nod at the minimum, then screw the academy and it's members, they're idiots. Anyways, long story short easily the best movie that I have seen in at least 10 years (I'm 32 so I've seen lots of movies to compare against. I have never gone back to a theatre to watch a movie twice, but I have already made plans to go with three different groups of friends to see this one.

This is the only movie I have ever bought tickets for in advanced and seen the first showing. It was well worth it. I'm going to see it again tomorrow.

I know that the original soundtrack has a lot more to it and wondered what was different about the movie from the musical. As I said, I loved the movie, the songs, the way it was put together, etc. It had me so emotionally involved that I was in tears by the end of it (and yeah, none of you know me, but i am not the type of person that cries in movies...ever.) But I'm confused about Mimi a bit...I thought she had aids in the musical, but in the movie I didn't necessarily get that...maybe I was too busy singing along and missed something, but the way she was portrayed made her seem like a drug addict and that was it...does the musical provide more explanation for the characters and their backgrounds/conditions? Was the story line changed for the movie? Pretty much I just wanna know hear someone who has seen the musical that can compare both and pick out the differences. Thanks!",Rent

My only problem was the sometimes awkward transition between song and dialogue. It didn't translate well on the screen, like it does in theater. Other than that, the film had a great cast and the voices were magnificent. I had never seen the play, but I saw the film with a RENT-obsessed friend who assured me that this was congruent enough. The story is heart-wrenching and laughter-inducing simultaneously and the characters manage to grab you and pull you into the story without your awareness until you too cry as they do. I did have one other criticism that may merely be an inevitable flaw when translating theater to the silver screen, but at times the ""love will prevail"" message was overt and trite and one could almost guess the next lines.

623,hisamsmith,Rent the movie,10,24 November 2005,"I saw the stage show first at the age of 13 in a small amateur Indiana theater..... and fell head over heels in love. I've seen it twice since than, once on Broadway! I've been following the idea of making this movie since 2002. Tonight I saw what I've been waiting 3 years for.First off it's being marketed all wrong, it is not strictly a romance movie. There is much more to the movie, it's a story of learning to live while dying with dignity and the value of friendship and love. THere are gay couples, transsexuals, mentions of sex and sexual practices, drugs, and death in the movie. Please think of this before you decide to go. The people behind myself and my sister, didn't know and got quite a shock. And from the reactions around me, my party and a young gay couple who sat in front of us, were the only persons who had seen or heard the play or music.Otherwise the movie was done very well. There were songs cut out, not surprising because one of them referred to safe sex and bad sex, but it flowed well. It truly made me love the characters and care that they would die before they lived out their lives. I laughed when Mark started singing La vie Bohme aimed at Benny. Hated Benny with a passion when he tried to break-up the protest. Felt pity for JOANN when she realized Maureen was cheating on her. Believed in love at first sight the first time Roger and Mimi looked into each others eyes.Sang from the depth of my soul through all my favorite songs (i wasn't the only one). And cried like I was burying a treasured friend when Angel died in Tom Collin's arms.It is a movie that stays with a person long after the last musical number and the rolling of the credits.

624,jason-1108,An Unfortunate Disappointment,3,24 November 2005,"In short, save the $9 ticket price, and buy the Broadway Cast Album instead. It will bring you much more joy and will give you a vastly better perspective on the composer's original vision.I consider the film to be an unsuccessful translation of the show, which I have seen in New York eight (8) times as of 11/23/05. I appreciate that making a film of a play must be very difficult, and I don't fault Mr. Columbus or Mr Chbosky for being unsuccessful, but I think that some of the choices made in altering the original, Pulitzer Prize winning, book were unfortunate.In general, I thought that the film was tedious and disjoint, but the most severe problem was that I felt no empathy with the characters in the film, whereas I do in the play.The film was stripped of most of the original book's wit and edge. Where was Mark's mom singing on the answering machine? Where was Alexi Darling's message from the Hamptons? And Mimi's dance at the Cat Scratch Club, like many other aspects of the film, was sanitized to ensure the film's PC-13 rating. Can you imagine Quentin Tarintino sanitizing Salma Hayek's dance in From Dusk Till Dawn to get a PG-13 rating? A correctly made film would have received an ""R"" or ""NC-17"" rating. If you can imagine how interesting Pulp Fiction would be without profanity or violence, you can imagine how interesting the film Rent is.",Rent
625,flutterbywingzz,Stage Brought to life in the Big Screen,10,24 November 2005,"I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and appreciate that the great story that is RENT has now been immortalized on film. The secret is out to the world, and has gained many new fans.The performances were incredible, especially Roger, Collins, Angel, Maureen, Joanne, and to some extent, Mimi. They remained very true to the stage version, although they left a few scenes out, which still managed to work very well for the film. I got the same kind of rush I get when I see it live on stage, but I have to admit, something is missing: I have concluded that what I feel is missing, is that most of the band wagoners who saw the movie, missed a lot of the depth of the story, and focused mostly on ""new age"" romance and the sheer shock value (rebellion against societal standards) verbalized in the songs, and were there to see an actor on film that they think is kind of ""hot"". For instance, a lot of people in the crowd were there to see the movie only because they appreciate the actors in the movie, rather than the actual beauty and profundity of the story.This morning, I turned the morning radio news on, and much to my un-delighted surprise, heard a song from RENT being played that I have never heard on the radio in all the years that RENT has been loved by many musical theater appreciators. I smell commercial success, and that smell often leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of die hard fans, and unfortunately, ends up ruining something that was once a great thing for people who weren't afraid to explore non-commercial and alternative sources of media and entertainment. With commercial success, I fear that the makers of the movie have sold out, and encouraged a whole generation of band wagoners to miss the point completely.This, of course is just my opinion. Like I said, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but could have done without the people in the audience wooing and awing over how cute an actor or actress was during a very profound scene, thus missing what was said, and what RENT was written to make people hear.Still, when the movie is released on DVD, I will be at the store to buy it, perhaps standing in line behind two hundred 15 year old Taye Diggs fans.",Rent

When I found out that Chris Columbus would be making a film version of Rent, I was a little bit doubtful. As a theater fan, I much prefer a stage version of many productions (ie. I hated the recent Chicago movie). However, when I saw the first trailer for Rent, with the entire song Seasons of Love, I cried. Such a powerful, beautiful song could only lead the way for a powerful beautiful movie. I started counting down the days, and finally, the day this movie was released in theaters, I was first in line. I was impressed with the movie from the first second. It was beautiful. The power of the movie took effect on me right at the song Without You, where I began to cry and just cried until the very end.

While I did not like that, per say (they took out one of my favorites on the street before Christmas) it fit the time constraint for a general audience, and it helped the movie itself flow. One thing I can say that really bothered me is Mark in the opening sequence might as well have sang the song. Speaking the words sounded awkward and unnatural. The actors did an excellent job, I especially liked Angel and Collins.

I however do own the dual cassette of the original Broadway cast production and experienced it in my mind as I listened along with the dialogue and amazing songs. I am a fan of Law & Order, so when Jesse L. Martin announced he would be taking a hiatus from that to do the feature film version of Rent, I began salivating. 6 out of the 8 original cast members were going to be in the movie, so I knew on it's release date, I would be anywhere Rent was. I loved it so much I will see it over and over again. It is an experience the makes me regret even more not seeing it on Broadway. This movie is touching and as true to Jonathan Larsons vision as a film can get. Considering all of the movies out now with their special effects and remakes of old movies, this film is so raw and refreshingly human. It is about people, so it focused on people without all of the special effects that plague our movie screens and minds nowadays. Please forget all that the movie critics are saying regarding this movie. Their expectations are out of reach. This movie is what it is and it is a movie about our world, for our world today by a man who knows our world. Please go out and see this movie again and again.

Even though I have held a special place in my heart for Larson and his message for such a long time I was pretty apprehensive about the idea of someone making this a feature film. In my opinion it couldn't be done. I felt there was no way to capture the beauty and soul of Rent outside of the stage. I WAS WRONG!! Columbus truly understood what was needed to adapt this musical to a movie. In many ways it was done better than the musical. The audience is still guided through the ups and downs of the characters lives through powerful music and themes, but the connection between the audience and the characters is able to be developed and nurtured much better with Columbus' direction. What was most important was the fact that he never lost site of the fact that Rent is a musical. He stayed true to the story's roots because the music is what makes the story so powerful.

638,allhailthewhimperinghero,versus the stage,8,26 November 2005,"Certainly I'll agree that the live version left quite a bit to the imagination in that not all, be it setting or circumstance, was immediately clear, but that comes with the limits of the theatre. A film camera can go anywhere and catch happenings from many angles and distances, which can then be spliced together for effect, a far cry from the single plane of a stage. Because of this, the film was able to reveal their lives more viscerally. The opening sequence and the Life Cafe scene were especially lovely treats.If you are a huge fan of the original music and the way the voices come together and their tone and how everyone sounds and the power in that rush to the ears, you may be disappointed with the film. Yes, everyone did well and their voices sounded nice, but in comparison, I feel the film falls short. Possibly because more can be seen and felt through sight and visual expression of film, the emotion in the music or voice, or, for that matter, the song need not be present. Where two mini stories are told at the same time on the stage, only one is present in the film in the song, leaving odd gaps of waiting which may take some getting used to.One other sense of the missing comes with the explanatory sentences, while helpful in introducing background and moving along the plot, felt like summaries... not only as if something more full of life and sensation had to be cut and trimmed to a blip, a mere transition or useful footnote, but also in that they seemed obligatory, un-conversational and maybe even unnatural.The film is a joy, no doubt, and I trust a new audience will gain a love of the story. I also imagine fans being divided in reaction -- and not in a love/hate relationship either. There will be those who prefer the film, and those whose love of the live performance is reinforced.

So when I heard about the movie version, I was at first hesitant, then accepting when I learned that the cast was almost entirely the original cast I saw on (off) Broadway.Anyway, the show was awesome. You could tell from the first few scenes that they weren't trying to simply put the theater production on film. The first big number (""Rent"") features a lot of action and what appears to be a very large set, with a lot more singers in this scene than were in the entire theater production. At one point, the camera backs up for a long shot of three apartment buildings with all the residents out on their fire escapes venting about their financial frustrations.Another difference is the use of recitative to advance the plot: the Broadway show featured very few actual spoken words between the large songs, more resembling a (rock) opera than a typical musical in its use of dialog set to simple, almost sing-song tunes. The movie uses most of the same dialog, but it's spoken instead of sung. This means the soundtrack won't be as representative of the entire show as the musical's soundtrack is, and the overall package is more palatable to the average moviegoer.The flexibility that movie-making allows has really opened up this show. The original set was rather sparse, and relied on audience interpretation. This worked really well sometimes. (Take Me) Out Tonight for instance, didn't really depend on the support of a set: Mimi's expression of desire didn't need to be pinned down to a specific place, and came out as a pure vocal expression of emotion, rather than a reaction to her surroundings. However, the last third of the stage production has always been a little odd in my eyes. Because the characters are flung across so many locations and the action switches back and forth between them so rapidly, set usage on stage never really ""gelled"" for me. The movie version's sets really added the last bit of information I needed.I know there are musical theater purists out there that think that a movie version of Rent is an abomination before god, but I disagree. I think musical theater is fantastic, but there are stories you can tell through video that you can't tell on live stage. This is a story that benefited from the production values and flexibility of Hollywood. On the flip side though, I don't think the stage version of Rent will die any time soon. There's a human quality conveyed in a live stage show that you can't touch on any screen. There's always an amount of interaction between the performers on stage and the audience, and Rent uses that to its advantage (""Moo with me!"").A word about the vocal quality: as you'd expect (or fearfully hope), the vocal ability of every member of the cast is astounding. There was exactly one moment in the whole movie that I noticed anyone straying from the center of the pitch, and that was so inconsequential I don't remember where it came in the show. However, I must say that I was a little put off by Mimi's (Rosario Dawson's) voice. Don't get me wrong, she's an absolutely awe-inspiring singer, but she seems to have such tight control of her voice that she sounds overproduced. (Either that, or she was overproduced for this production, in which case, they mucked it up good.) I was surprised by the sharp edges of her tone choice- she seemed to change pitch with robotic precision, always hitting her intended pitch. Do you remember that Cher song ""Believe"" (Life after Love) wherein Cher's voice was electronically altered to produce escape tones and anticipations? If it's an ability that Ms. Dawson possesses in her vocal abilities, my hat is off to her, but if it's an electronic effect, then someone at Sony Pictures should be fired.All in all , I think Rent is a fantastic movie that stands on its own. When paired with the stage musical, the story they tell becomes even stronger.",Rent

There are not many movies out there that can get me so into them that I cry. This movie made me cry numerous times, it was like I was feeling their pain and suffering. When she first told me that we were going to see the movie I wasn't to enthused. But after I saw it I am more than willing to go back and see it as many times as possible. I don't think actors on stage could do a better job than the actors in the movie. The singing was incredible! I know when I really like the way someone sings when I get tingles throughout my whole body and up my spine. I give many kudos to all of the actors and especially the director for the effort they must have put into this. If anyone went to see it and they didn't like it, I don't know what is wrong with them, honestly I think that is the best movie I have ever seen in my entire life.",Rent

It really touched my heart.I also really loved the first scene. ""Seasons of Love"" was a great opening song. I also noticed that as the camera panned past the actors, their voice was heard louder because they were actually singing. It wasn't some cheesy track, it was their voice.I am also very impressed about how much they made the setting look like 1989 New York. Though I do not know that firsthand, I heard many times from people who grew up around that part of New York that it looked great.Thank you to all cast and crew involved in this movie.",Rent

The first scene you get chills and the chills don't leave during the whole show. i am at home now and I still have the chills. I loved that after the show no one moved.

645,x_nuclearstars,A Must See,10,6 December 2005,"Before I even begin this, I will state that I have not yet seen the original Broadway version of RENT. I do, however, have tickets for an upcoming show in New York City.This movie was amazing. I am really pleased with the direction that Columbus took the movie in. Some of my friends who had already seen the play complained that he didn't stick to either a Hollywood screenplay or a Broadway screenplay, but I do find the middle ground to be the best way to approach an epochal movement like RENT. Even though he cut out half of ""Goodby Love"" and added a verse to ""Seasons of Love,"" his choice of actors make up for it. By casting most of the original cast, Columbus removed a major tribulation that many directors are troubled by: natural chemistry. These people had to be around each other day in and day out for practically six months, so of course a chemistry would be sparked.His choices in Rosario Dawson (Mimi) and Tracie Thoms (Joanne) were, for lack of a better word, extraordinary. Who could have known that Dawson could sing? Although Joanne is typically played by more masculine-looking women, Thoms' voice is more than unbelievable.This movie is spectacular. There is no doubt in my mind that after seeing this movie, anyone who has not seen the show will immediately buy tickets for it. Just as I did. If the presence exhibited on screen is half as good on stage, it is no wonder the show has been such a hit. Go see this movie. Even if you don't love it because you don't feel it captured the show, think about how many people did love it and have since then gone to see the show because of the movie. It's a lot cheaper to purchase a 7 dollar movie ticket than it is to scrounge up money for the pilgrimage to New York.I cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD. RENT in the privacy of my own home means that I can sing along with the songs and cry without worrying who's listening or watching.yours-",Rent
646,Sornotic,Rent is AMAZING!,10,28 November 2005,"Having never heard of Rent before a few weeks ago, I can honestly say that this movie has clearly shown me the definition of an INCREDIBLE film. With an amazing cast and absolutely astounding music numbers, Rent is by far the best movie/musical I have ever seen. No lie.The movie opens on a light note, with the cast members singing the signature song ""Seasons of Love,"" one of the best and most recurring in the movie. It then brings the problem of the story to light: the tenants of Avenue A can't pay the past year's rent. In the main opening song ""Rent,"" they explain why they aren't going to pay, either. The main characters, Roger and Mark, are roommates dealing with problems of their own. Roger is an ex-musician with AIDS and Mark is a struggling filmmaker striving to find ""something interesting"" about life to put on film.Through a gang fight, some phone calls, and the ""lighting of a candle,"" the cast members all meet each other and learn of each other's problems. Roger meets Mimi, the AIDS-induced stripper in the apartment underneath him. Mark meets Joanne, a lesbian lawyer who stole his previous girlfriend. Angel, a drag queen drummer, meets Collins, a computer genius that's friends with Mark and Roger, and falls in love. From there, the rest of the musical stems.The most impressive number is by far ""La Vie Boheme,"" which includes the cast members singing and dancing wildly, jumping on tables and expressing the importance of Bohemians in society. Another memorable song, ""Take Me or Leave Me,"" shows Maureen's (Mark's old girlfriend) love for Joanne, who's having second thoughts about their relationship.When a sudden loss takes place, the whole plot changes, and message of the movie becomes more engrained into your brain than the modern alphabet. The last song, ""No Day But Today,"" truly gives you a reason to live each day to the fullest. All of the loose strands of plot meet and when it's over, you'll wish it wasn't over! Honestly, this is the most incredible movie of 2005, and maybe the most incredible musical in the past ten years! Definitely a MUST-SEE!!!!! 1,000,000 STARS!!!",Rent
647,csilvest,Unbelievable,10,5 December 2005,"I had to give this movie a perfect 10. To start with, I am a Rent-head. I make sure that I see this play at least once a year. When I go, I take some one who has not seen it. After the witness the greatness of Rent, the soon run to a music store to buy it on CD and listen to it non-stop. When I heard they were making the movie, at first, I was a little worried. That feeling was quickly subdued once I heard that many members of the original cast would be in it. Dawson took over the role of Mimi, but it was necessary. The sets they used where great. Mimi in the Cat-Scratch Club was one of my favorites, as well as the scene in the Life Cafe. I will not lie and it might sound alittle much, but for the most part, I was covered with goosebumps and chills were running through my body with emotion from how well the actors performed. I feel that in the movie, it was easier to make intimate connections with the characters than it is while watching the play. There is only one thing that I cannot wait for when it comes to Rent, the DVD!!!!!

The movie shows through song and action the Love friendship creates. When I saw this movie I felt that the group of friends were my friends as well and every special or trialling moment for them was also a moment for me. If you really want to see a musical show put into a fantastic movie, this is it. The songs are very catchy and you'll find yourself humming them. However, the songs are very good, and unlike other songs which stick these make you want to sing them out loud. My favorite is... Well I don't have one because they are all great!

649,spostal,This movie is only for current RENT fans.,4,28 November 2005,"As someone who saw the movie without ever having seen the play-- let alone memorized the music and lines-- I found this movie wholly unenjoyable. I should say, however, that I am a major Broadway fan and am not at all opposed to the Broadway/Hollywood crossover in the least! In fact, ""CHICAGO"" comes highly recommended.Anyway, back to ""RENT""...The acting was ""alright"" at best given the high amount of overacting necessary to pull off singing every few minutes in a movie. The actors clearly did the best job they could've done and my distaste for the movie does not lie with them.The lyrics throughout the play are predictable, simple, and cheesy. You could predict one word to the next without ever having heard the show because the songs were the sort of thing you might've written in middle school during an especially angsty moment. (...measure a year in love?...) Towards the end of the movie, the plot becomes overextended a few times over when you have the first beloved protagonist die followed by an argument involving the rest of the cast about how much they love each other but can't be together AGAIN, swiftly capped off by another protagonist getting lost, getting found, carried dramatically into an apartment, sung to through the misty eyes of her former/current lover, her death, and then her reawakening thanks to the word of the other dead character who told her to go back from the light.

It could have been so much better. Thank God Jonathan Larson wrote a brilliant piece that can hold its old. The movie, tried too hard. It lacked the edgy, grittiness, the world these characters lived in. Not to mention NYC in the 90's.

There's still too much fear of diversity, especially in the south and I believe this production will help many understand and appreciate diversity and relationships in a different level.

I haven't seen it, but I have listened to it almost everyday after I first heard of it, and i could really understand what Johnathan Larson was trying to say. This movie gave me the same vibe, and having the majority of the original cast in it helped a lot. The music speaks for itself. Not all of the original songs are in it, but all in all the music is beautiful. Most professional critics gave it bad reviews because, to me, they were comparing it to the original stage play. Nothing will ever be as good as the original, but this will do.",Rent
653,DivaDani23,A bad adaptation of a brilliant show,3,28 November 2005,"If someone were to write a guide called ""What NOT to do When Making a Movie Musical,"" Rent would no doubt come up time and time again. As a RENThead since its opening ten years ago, I was horrified by the move that this musical has made from stage to screen.A note, before I start my rant: buy the soundtrack to this film. The orchestration for the songs that made it to the film is to die for; this is how full, lush, and beautiful these songs were meant to sound. The OBC cast has only gotten better with age as they find themselves with the chance to go back and improve their performances from the Broadway soundtrack. Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson are terrific additions to the bunch, and make the roles of Joanne and Mimi their own with great style and skill.As for the adaptation, it's hard to know where to start. I'm still perplexed as to why the screenwriter chose to copy and paste lines from songs into spoken dialogue. This forced a cast of talented and capable actors to fight against instinct, working against rhyming and metered lines so that dialogue seemed awkward at best. The complete absence of score under the spoken portions of the play made the time between songs lengthier than it was, and when a booming electric guitar came out of nowhere, it was truly a mystery as to what sort of reality we were in. Musicals require you to suspend reality so that characters can burst into song without it seeming ridiculous. This movie provided no such suspension.After a lovely rendition of ""Seasons of Love,"" we cut to a few shots of Mark's films, and then we burst right on into the title song. We have the time or material to characterize Mark or Roger, and we really don't care if they can pay their rent or not. We don't get a chance to figure out who they are. It's keeps on going downhill from there. Maureen's more childish and silly rendition of ""Over the Moon"" works in exact opposition to Idina Menzel's terrific presence and voice. She tries to get some of it back on ""Take me or Leave me,"" and Thoms is there to match her, but Maureen has already become a flat, throw-away character, a real loss for the film.The heavy cuts to the original storyline in favor of more ""entertaining"" fare like the commitment ceremony between Maureen and Joanne left me wondering why Angel was so important to the story at all. A series of perhaps 5 or 6 shots of an ailing Angel were all we got before his death, and the utter childishness of the shooting of ""I'll Cover You"" did not provide us with the depth of feeling we needed to truly appreciate the loss of that character. Jesse L. Martin and company did a beautiful job at the funeral service, but then we were right back where we started.In short, it was beyond frustrating to watch a show I loved so dearly go so wrong so quickly. By the time Roger was singing on that giant rock formation in Santa Fe as though we were in a bad country music video, I knew this movie was beyond saving. To those who see the movie who have not seen the show, I promise you that on stage, Rent is ten times more powerful, moving, and beautiful than anything you saw on that movie screen. Chris Colombus, if it ain't broke, PLEASE don't fix it!",Rent
654,Rhall4,One of the best movies I have seen for a while,9,28 November 2005,"Four of us women went and saw RENT the day after Thanksgiving. None of us had ever seen the Broadway play. Luckily, my daughter and I saw the cast on ""The View"" that morning which gave us more of an idea of what the movie would be about. All four of us said we were emotionally worn out when it was over. We cried and laughed and agreed that we would like to see it again. I don't want to give it away but the one scene with Angel and Tom Collins is so emotional and so realistic. We all agreed that we thought Angel was great so great that I did forget he was a man instead of a woman. And the love that Tom shows for him is heart wrenching. Everyone in the movie is great and the music is wonderful and when it was over the audience clapped liked they had never seen a movie like this before. We thought everyone did a great job acting and singing but we like Angel, Tom, Mimi and Joanne the best. We are ages 51, 45, 22 and 20 and we all loved it so its for all ages. My mom wants to see it and a woman I work with had seen it on Broadway twice before and liked the movie version best. However, my daughters boyfriend, my husband and my friends husband all said they were glad we didn't make them go because they wouldn't like it.

Rosario Dawson and Tracy Thoms were also an incredible fit with the original cast.I laughed out loud and I sobbed with the raw emotion.Very cool to see scenes take shape on the screen that you could never even hope to accomplish in the same way on stage.I went with a large group of 'theatre' people and we left drained and exhilarated at the same time.Terrific movie - best I've seen in a long time.

658,iatethesun,Rent,5,29 November 2005,"I discovered Rent in the summer of 2004. The story was familiar (being based on Puccini's La Boheme) and I had heard a handful of the songs before, but suddenly I got swept up in the tale of a group of artists struggling to live and love in a part of New York I had glimpsed and heard about, but never experienced. Perhaps it was the music, with its lush melodies and exhilarating rock n' roll undertones, perhaps it was the strong, unique voices, perhaps it was the score's honesty and unflinching devotion to truth and reality, that drew me into that world. I saw myself in each of the eight main characters, and they immediately became a part of my soul. They, with all their layers, complexities, and hypocrisies became my friends, my mentors, my soul mates. Mimi, the teenager stuck in a harsh, adult world. Roger, the HIV+ musician fighting the demons of his past and trying to survive in a world in which he has no future. Benny, the sellout who gave up his friends for money and security in an act that was simultaneously brave and cowardly, and all too understandable. Collins, the brilliant teacher, silenced by a world uninterested in what he had to say. Joanne, the lawyer straddling the boundary between the life she wants to lead and the one that is expected of her. Maureen, the diva, who despite her flaws, is bold, real, and alive. Angel, the embodiment of strength, joy, and goodness, who is able to find happiness and a reason to live despite the expiration date stamped on his life. And, Mark, the filmmaker, the observer, the scribe who creates a record of his friends' lives, even as he struggles to find reason and meaning in his own. I fell in love with these characters because they spoke to me, not with words of wisdom but with words of truth.Let's start with the bottom line: yes, I loved the movie. Is Rent a perfect movie? No. There are a few places that could have had smoother editing, a few melodramatic moments, and one or two staging decisions that could have been better. However, in a film filled with truly brilliant and beautiful moments (and there are many) these instances seem unimportant. They certainly didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie, though I have to admit their existence from a purely critical perspective. What's more important however is the fact that this movie exists, that it is there for people to love or hate, think about and discuss. It is the kind of movie that millions will love. A movie in which people will find joy and inspiration. It is also a movie that many won't accept or understand. Some won't like it. But everyone should see it.A few notes: Credits Sequence: I enjoyed the use of Seasons of Love as an opening credits song. Having the characters singing on that stage in an empty theater was not only a great homage to the show, but toyed with the themes in the film: solidarity vs. isolation, reality vs. performing, etc. It recalled, perhaps unintentionally, the Shakespearean soliloquy ""Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player. That struts and frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more."" Is a human life significant, and if so, how do we measure it, the song asks.Tango: Maureen: One of my favorite scenes. A lot of fun, very effective, beautifully shot. And one of my favorite songs. One of the most interesting ""staging"" decisions.Over The Moon: Very, very funny and well done. Definitely memorable. Idina was great.La Vie Boheme, I Should Tell You, LVB B: Among the best scenes in the movie high energy, really engaging, great song, of course, all of the actors do an amazing job. Seasons of Love B: Good transition.Take Me Or Leave Me: I was very worried about how this staging would work, but I loved it. Great acting, great vocals, just the right mix of humor and tension.Without You: Definitely within the Top 3 most memorable moments in the movie, and brilliant on all fronts acting, direction, cinematography. Beautiful, powerful, amazing.Finale A, Your Eyes, Finale B: Very strong, beautiful ending.Each actor had at least a few moments of utter brilliance. I loved them all. Rosario was brilliant. Tracie added so many new layers to Joanne and was a joy to watch. Idina was beautiful, hilarious, natural, and presented a really multi-layered, nuanced version of Maureen. Anthony was adorable, and was simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking. Jesse and Wilson had a few over-the-top moments, but they were more than compensated for by how amazing they were throughout. Adam was great and very beautiful. Taye was in only a few scenes but he was really good. He was beautiful too.Again, I loved this movie and will return to it many times. It isn't perfect, but it is touching, funny, and important. It is also a record of a time, a place, a group of people, that should be preserved for ever. I am forever grateful that it can exist, and that people, even if it is a small group, walk away with a small part of the film whether it is a lyric from La Vie Boheme, a tune they can't get out of their head, the name of an actor they had never encountered before, or a newfound resolve for life and love of humanity. For some, this movie will nothing more than a name on a marquee, but for a few, this will be something that will become part of them forever it will allow them to own a piece of this legacy called Rent. And that, would be a wonderful thing, because as the song says, ""you are what you own.""",Rent
659,dcusmctop,Translation to screen is spotty,6,29 November 2005,"I've seen the Broadway production, I believe with the original cast members as in the movie back in the late 90s. I just love the music and sing to it my truck all the time. However, I think the translation of the play to the screen was spotty. Some of the adjustments for length, including some of the city, worked for me. But it comes across a bit choppy to me. The introduction of spoken dialogue between songs is routine in these translations but they use it some unevenly in the movie, I think it just causes interruptions in the sequence. There are also a number of fades to a black screen, usually added for insertion of TV commercials, which last longer than your normal movie. They seemed to stand out and drop the mood and momentum at times. It just left the theater dark after some powerful numbers here and there. There were some points of the play, plays on words which I have never caught in the music but were well done in the movie. But I was disappointed in the translation. I've seen other theatre productions done on the screen which I think worked better. Just my thoughts, difficult though to say as I like the story so much. GOOF: Mark's looks straight ahead, then to the left, then straight ahead when he is supposed to be just observing during the reprise of 'I should tell you' when Mimi is laying on the table.",Rent
660,awesome_amanda,Don't miss Rent,10,1 December 2005,"Far from being the cheesy model of ""The American Musical"" that we are so used to, Rent is a beautiful portrayal of the human spirit. The flow from dialogue to song is perfect and does not seem contrived. Rent focuses on the love and friendship of a group of Bohemians in New York, but, I think, more beautifully portrays the heartbreaking reality of AIDS during the late eighties and early nineties.""Rent"" really comes through on the human drama. It deals with everything from love, to drug addiction, to death. Some may not want to see this movie if gay love scenes gross you out but I think the wonderful thing about this work is that, like ""Philadelphia"", the homosexuals in the movie are portrayed as wonderful people and are used for more than just jokes. Whether or not you agree with homosexuality, you fall in love with the characters and go through all their ups and downs with them.One of the best parts of the movie in my opinion is the fact that most of the actors played the original characters in the Broadway Musical. This,to me, adds something to the movie.

With a movie you have very few limits and boundaries so instead of staying in one place (the stage) it's in various different places and it brings the story so much more to life. I really felt connected to the characters more so than I think I would have if I saw the play. Overall, I was very pleased with it and I think that if you like movies, you like laughing,and you like crying (this movie made me cry my eyes out!) then this is definitely the movie for you! If you don't like it, I'm sorry to hear that because It's amazing!",Rent
662,dweiss11,Excellent,10,2 December 2005,"I saw the movie Rent today for the second time this week, and I have to say I love it!! I saw Rent on Broadway 4 times; the first 2 times were with the original cast, the last 2 were not. For me to see most of the original cast together again was so amazing! I had chills up and down my body, I cried, I laughed, I loved it!! I thought Rosario Dawson did a great job filling Mimi's (Daphne Ruben-Vega's) big shoes. The adaptation to the screen was great, the singing was amazing, and I thought the whole movie was a great tribute to Jonathan Larsen and Rent fans everywhere. I plan on seeing it again in the movie theater, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD- I will be the first on line to buy it.",Rent
663,thetimevvarp,My opinion of the movie.,10,2 December 2005,"I have always wanted to see the Broadway play RENT, but have never got a chance because it does not come to where I live, but once I saw the previews for the movie version I was extremely excited. I went on Thanksgiving, the second day, here in California. Ever since the first song in the movie I was sucked in. The characters are amazing. Each one sucks you into their life, and you love them! All of the songs show extreme emotion and I will admit that I cried a few times. The film was very beautiful. Rosario Dawson did an awesome job stepping in for Mimi Marquez. I believe that most of the main characters in Rent were actually in the original cast which is awesome! The only thing I can say is that the movie is a must see! I saw a few sites and it had bad reviews. The first thing I thought was, "" You have got to be kidding me! This movie is the best! "" Rent is now officially my favorite movie.",Rent
664,Galensworld1,This is Amazing Movie Making,10,4 December 2005,"Saw the movie today, and immediately walked out of the theatre, crossed the mall, to the music store to purchase the soundtrack. This movie is a wonderful experience, for everybody. Was in a theatre lacking patrons (Living in small town south, they probably FEAR this movie), but those of us who were there all responded to this movie the way it's meant to be: laughing, crying, FEELING (and owning those feelings, not renting, as the line goes). Even the straight folks in the theatre understood that they were witnessing something special. I cried for those I've lost to AIDS, and cheered at the hopeful messages of the film. I saw old friends in some of the faces on the screen, and enjoyed their obvious delight in being a part of something important. Actors were delightful. Wilson Jermaine Heredia (ANGEL) steals the movie in every scene she's in. Music was incredible, and fills one to overflow. I do recommend the soundtrack, because there are lyrics that need to be heard again to be fully appreciated. Bluntly, I love movies. I really love musicals, though they are few and far between. RENT is a must see. Will return with my very own ""Joanne"" (Smiling here) to see it on the big screen again, then wait impatiently to buy the DVD. One of the first things I did when I got home was to check on tickets to NYC to see the play. Yes, this movie affected me greatly.",Rent

It's news to me when a full-out strip club scene, excessive (and profound) use of drugs, the word ""f**k"" at least three times, and a woman's naked butt should constitute a rating suitable for a teenager not even out of junior high. Don't get me wrong, I loved (most) of the movie, and the music was absolutely spectacular, but I was shocked by many of the things I saw that I expected only to see in an R-rated movie. You may think I'm some self-righteous, church-going, overprotective mother who's been screening movies for her kids, but I'm actually a 17-year old male (yeah, the species who stereotypically LIKES seeing drug use and naked women) - and I think the Motion Picture Association of America has made a terrible mistake in rating this movie.",Rent

All though Rent first debuted ten years ago, the context still is current. Every time i see it, it makes me smile and it gives me hope that one day we will fight this disease. i thought that Rosario Dawson did a wonderful job as 'mimi'. and the fact that 6 out of 8 cast member were the original was wonderful. it's great to see that the movie studio and filmmakers recognized their talent and asked them to portray their original characters.",Rent

Ever since then, I have listened to the CD numerous times, so much so that I know it by heart and remember the amazing show as if I saw it yesterday. Well, recently I watched the new movie in the theater. I wasn't sure what to expect, since movie versions can be so cheesy... THANKFULLY, I was pleasantly surprised and found a movie that any Rent-die-hard-fan could call their own. Christopher Columbus did an amazing job bring the play to the silver-screen.

This show contains 5 of the original cast members and the other two (Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thom) fit in just fine. I immediately went out and bought the soundtrack. I was with a friend who saw the stage production, as I have not, and he liked the film better because he thought it conveyed the story much better than the stage production. However, he loved the stage production and I still want to see the stage production very much!!",Rent

It definitely is a crier though. The music is terrific and every seen is one which you want to just watch over and over. It's a good idea to see the movie before the play because it does explain the plot much better than the play. I absolutely loved this movie, it is my new favorite. Does contain a lot of things you may not want to see with your parents, or younger siblings/kids. For the most part, the movie kept very true to the show. All of the actors are terrific. Possibly the best movie of the year.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Rent
671,dot026,Ignore the critics,9,5 December 2005,"When critics learn to sing and dance their hearts out, what they have to say might have some credibility. RENT was a wonderful production, with exemplary actors and singers. The message transcends time and is as important now as it was in 1996 and earlier. Each actor gave of their hearts and souls in making this production and it proved an emotional journey for the original Broadway cast. Idina, Jesse, Taye, Wilson, Adam and Anthony welcomed unconditionally Tracie and Rosario and the ensemble was flawless. They lived their parts and this came through in the film. Their familiarity with their characters made this production solid and real. Both sad and uplifting while being representative of the real world, there is 'no day but today' and what better philosophy to espouse. One never knows what tomorrow will bring so in keeping with Jonathan Larson's message - forget regret or life is yours to miss. See the film and encourage others to experience RENT!!",Rent

The movie was incredibly close to the original show - only a few small differences!! The new cast members were awesome! It was very well directed!! I recommended it to everyone I know!!! The songs were amazing. The cinematography was very well done. It sucks you right into the story and by the end you feel as if you were part of their family. You laugh when they laugh, you cry when they cry, and everything in between. I was very leery of making this show into a major motion picture, but I'm glad they did it.

That threw me off a bit. Other than that, I thought that the movie was good and I would definitely recommend it to someone. I really enjoyed the parts of the movie that dove into the lives of the characters as well. The hospital scenes with Angel were heart-wrenching.

Rosario Dawson did an amazing job, i never knew how great of a singer she is. But it puts how people in the lower classes live and how AIDS affects people lives into perspective. Surprisingly Taye Diggs wasn't a horrible singer as i was positive he would be.

675,mooncat200,Rent= ...,10,10 December 2005,There are no words to describe RENT it went far and beyond what any movie I have ever seen or heard of dared touch. It showed the side of things thats not always going to end up perfectly the way you want it to. It showed the reality of people dying and having AIDS. People just trying to find a way to pay last years rent and not get evicted from the only home they know. Its about not worrying about tomorrow or yesterday its about living like today is you're last day on earth and not worrying about the small things because some people have it so much worse then you do. My dad doesn't understand it I had to explain a lot but I still don't think he understood even me... you really have to understand its not just a musical its a protest on screen its a protest against everything we think life should be and everything all the movies are about. They took normal and shook it up until it wasn't what it used to be. RENT showed things the way they are it was pure truth no fluff-n-stuff to make the crowd happy nothing. No fiction just to please the audience. It was the truth and thats why I like it. people try to deny it but thats the way things are sometimes. I am so glad there is a movie like this. I have never seen the one on Broadway but now I really want to. I see things through new eyes now then I ever have before. RENT= BEAUTIFUL UNADULTERATED TRUTH RENT= LOVE AND HAPPYNESSRENT= SADNESS AND DEATH RENT= LIFEeveryone needs to see RENT,Rent
676,klutzymunkee72,Connection in an isolating age,10,12 June 2006,"RENT was an amazing movie, let's get that straight from the beginning. I was reluctant to see the movie after hearing the Mimi from the Broadway soundtrack and having friends (who can't sing) sing every song from the film. Finally, after being forced to watch it, I loved it.It is about people dealing with ""not dying from AIDS"" and gay/lesbian relationships but that's not what he entire movie was about. To me, there was something else; a different theme to look for. The way the lives of 8 people melded together seamlessly was amazing. The friendship they had and the love they had for each other was clear through the screen and by the end, you feel like you know the characters personally.I have seen Chris Columbus slaughter the Harry Potter books but he redeemed himself on this movie. While some things were edited and not every other line was sung like in the stage production, all the right songs were included so the audience never feels out of the loop and while some claim it to be a ""water-downed"" version are, while entitled to their opinions, mistaken.In my opinion, the right elements were there to leave the impact that Jonathon Larson was looking for. We just don't need to hear every cuss word or see every inch of skin to get the message. The beauty of the film is that it can portray the lives of 8 different people in""water downed"" way and still make us feel something.We cry for Collins, we love Mark and we all sympathize with Roger. Of course there's the fact that he has AIDS and has lost a girlfriend to it but most people find themselves reflected in his ""One Song Glory."" The song represents millions of people who are looking for their swan song, who are searching for a way to make their dreams come true and to leave an impact on the world. (My compliments to Adam Pascal in his amazing version of the song.) So of course there's always ""something"" wrong with a movie but as far as things go, RENT has made me feel happy/sad/inspired more than any movie I've seen in a long time.",Rent
677,ironbird08,See this film,10,11 December 2005,"An amazing movie that captures the essence of friendship: shared experiences (both good and bad) and unquestioned acceptance of your friends no matter who they are.The top-notch cast delivered powerful and unforgettable performances. I have no doubt that some will receive nominations for some movie industry awards; the difficult part to predict is who as there were no weak performances.I was uncertain whether Rosario Dawson was going to be up to the challenge of taking up the role of Mimi. My fears were put to rest quite early in the film and I can say with pleasure that she gave a great performance.I strongly suggest seeing this film at your local theatre as the big screen and enhanced sound made this a great experience.In summary, I am thrilled that the great performances of the original cast (most of the original cast anyway) has been captured on film.",Rent
678,akstarflake82-1,Goods and Bads,10,12 December 2005,"I thought this movie was an excellent display of love and love of life. It showed many aspects of life and different lifestyles. I warn you not to watch this if you are homophobic or in any way offended by this type of lifestyle. I LOVED this movie, it touched my heart, made me laugh and cry and want to sing along. I am in a place (alaska) that does not provide very many Broadway productions and was extremely grateful I was given the opportunity to enjoy a production like this, especially with the original cast. I was informed by someone who had the chance to see it in person on Broadway, and was told, much to my dismay, that the music isn't the same (most is, but some songs were taken out) and that the entire production is in song, but I think that it didn't affect the movie in a bad way at all. I hope you enjoy it too:)",Rent
679,ybunny6000,My point of view,10,25 March 2006,"I love when Tracie Thoms sings. I have always wondered what it would be like to play Joanne,and Tracie made me want to try really hard. Because to me it seems like a really hard job to play a lessie,but I like to push myself to the limit. Plus even though she tried time and time again to play Joanne on Broadway I think it was good that she got to play Joanne in the movie. I really don't get why she didn't get the part. I wish I could meet her in person. She is like my role model. I hope that I grow up to be just like Tracie. I would love to be able to sing that good. My favorite songs are Seasons of Love, Today 4 U, Tango: Maureen, Out Tonight, I'll Cover You, La Vie Boheme A&B, Take Me or Leave Me, Without You, I'll Cover You(Reprise), Finale B, and Love Heals.

I laughed with the characters, I cried with the characters, it was just excellent. I could actually feel as though I was in the movie and in the group with all of the characters. And the characters were so realistic, the were happy, joyous, grief-striken, envious, angry, and...just...wow!

I, like so many fans, fell in love with Jonathan Larson's music, haunting lyrics, and inspirational message almost a decade ago, and was cautious in going to see the film version. I was so beyond pleasantly surprised at how fantastic it was. It was as if no time had passed, the cast was as beautifully in tune with their characters as ever. The outstanding performance was by Anthony Rapp, who embodied the character of Mark so flawlessly I simply forgot he was acting. The film version is a magnificent accomplishment for both the actors and for director Chris Colombus. It simply should not be missed.",Rent

Also, they did a great job at replacing Mimi and Joanne with who they did.

Once again, I highly, highly, highly recommend seeing this movie! I will be buying it Tuesday from Best Buy!!! Everyone had an incredible performance, and if you didn't like it, its probably because you're an extreme conservative.

684,brothapeeps,Hmmm...,9,22 December 2005,"It's funny, I read all the bashing reviews on here and find that 9 times out of 10 it was bashed because of it's homosexual connotations, or the drug use, or the fact that these people live unhealthy lives. Lets start with the homosexuality ""issues"".As of right now, the year is 2005. We have had cities in the United States decide that marriage between homosexuals is legal and should be allowed. That's a pretty big step towards freedom. Obviously there are more against this movement than for it, so its self explanatory as to why people bash this movie's ""gayness"". But come on. You give a movie a bad review for having gay couples? Wake up! You homophobic wizards are going to just have to get used to homosexuals in movies. Movies are a reflection of our world and the things happening in it, and we have gay people. Personally I think that this aspect of the movie serves as a mirror for those who do oppose gay rights. They make their feelings about the matter quite apparent when they see something like this and complain.Now let's move on to drug use.Well, not much to say there. It's unfortunate but it happens. I'm sure plenty of people who post on here use drugs regularly be it legal or illegal. They are still drugs.But what about the quality of life these people have? You ever been to New York or any big city for that matter? There are thousands of homeless or poor living in every big city, and OH NO, this movie actually pointed it out to you. Sorry that you have to see the by product of our capitalist country in a movie where you went to enjoy yourself. Did it upset the balance of your pitiful 8 to 5 suburban soccer mom or dad life? What a damn shame. Someone made a comment about how these people love each other but they just let their friends do whatever, be it drugs or having sex with members of the same sex, etc... Well, in case you didn't notice, some of them have aids and when you have it, you have it. We don't have a cure yet so you are going to die if you have it. When death is certain, there is nothing better that you can do than enjoy what life you have left. You do what makes you happy. Now comes the, ""Well, what about giving aids to others?"" Everyone in this movie that had aids, only slept with someone who already had aids. In fact Roger didn't want to get with Mimi because he didn't know that she had aids. Hmmmm, I think that these people handle themselves pretty well for people who's bodies are dying.Now for my review: I was a bit skeptical, as any Renthead would be, when I first heard they were doing a movie, and even more so when I found out who the director was. I was most definitely excited though. I have seen the musical 9 times and I listen to the Original Broadway soundtrack religiously. I'm a music major at UW-Madison so I'm musically inclined as well. I know the music very well, and despite the flaws from Larson's semi-unprofessional music writing skills, it's enjoyable and quite good. Well, how do you improve on something already fantastically enjoyable? You hire someone to spice it up, and boy did they do a good job. I could have done without the changes to the vocals on One Song Glory, but it's still my favorite song, and I would have liked to have seen contact in the movie but I'll let minor changes slide. It's a movie ""adaptation"" not the musical.There were some continuity changes that bothered me a bit, but it worked alright. From the opening scene to the end of La Vi Boheme was all supposed to have been Christmas eve, but it actually took the span of several days time in the movie.The movie took place in a real world environment which made imagining it actually happening much easier, the subway ride while Collins sings Sante Fe comes to mind as a very enjoyable version of what happened.Angel's dance during Today for you, was a bit unenthusiastic compared to the Broadway show. It's quite something to see a guy jumping around in high heels off of tables and the like, when most women can't even do that. It was still quite well done though.There are some pretty heart wrenching moments in this movie. Being closer to the characters and making out facial expressions really made it easier to connect with them and share their pain and happiness. Bring a box of tissues to clean up afterward.P.S. I don't know if anyone else did it or if I'm just a loser, but the opening scene where they sang in the theater just set me off right away. I knew right from there that it would rock because I had tears in my eyes and goosebumps all over.",Rent
685,dysisgirl,Disappointing as far as movies go.,5,23 December 2005,"Let me start off by saying I've never seen Rent on stage before. So, I saw this movie as, well, a movie - not an adaption. And as far as movies go, this wasn't the best. The plot was all over the place, and I did not connect with the characters at all. The characters were very stereotyped - which works better on stage than in movies. Angel's and Tom's relationship just didn't evoke any emotions out of me - their relationship was just *there.* Later, when Angel died, I was sad, but not as sad as I could've been. I cry at almost every touching moment in a movie, but I did not cry when Angel died. His death was very forced, in my opinion, and it's because we were never truly given an opportunity to get to know and really like the characters. Also, the death scene was done in a cheesy way, so that kind of turned off my tears as well. Mimi and Roger, Maureen and Joanne - all the relationships in the movie were just strewn together, with barely any meaning in them. This disconnected plot and lack of character development really made the movie a bit of a drag for me.As far as acting and singing go, the cast wasn't bad. The actor who played Roger, however, did not do a very good job. His voice was alright, but his performance was flat and unemotional. Rosario Dawson did a great job in both acting and singing. But the best voices by far were Taye Diggs and the woman who played Joanne.If you want to see a movie depicting people struggling with AIDS, see documentaries about people who are stricken with the disease in Africa. If you want to see a movie about the struggle of gay people, see Brokeback Mountain - which did a far better job in terms of character development and beauty in subtle emotion. And if you want to see movies with the same message as Rent - which I believe is to live life with love - there are TONS of Academy Award winning movies with the same message that are not as dull and cheesy as Rent. But I have to say - the songs were very catchy. Spend the $8 you would've used on the ticket to buy the soundtrack.",Rent

But the first time I saw it, back in December, I cried from the saddest song in the movie until the end. Now I am absolutely in love with it. I even have the Original Broadway Cast recording. This musical is about LIFE. It's about living it to the fullest as if it's your last. Just watch this movie once, and just listen to the words. I call Jonathan Larson a genius every time I listen to it on the CD or watch the movie, and it's true. His words just get to you.

Naturally, I am a very fidgety person, but noticed about a forth of the way into the film, I was sitting still and I viewed people around me, which for the first time of going to movies, realized not a one person was talking, but just watching and listening. The movie makes you listen to the songs and let you know they have meaning behind their words. It makes you listen, feel, and rethink things on a level of self, career choice, and death.

I was not familiar with some of the cast members but you can bet I am now a fan of each one of them. Their voices blended so well together. I never got the opportunity to see it on Broadway but I rushed out as soon as the movie hit the theater and unlike so many other movies, I was not disappointed. It was a great study of humanity. Each and every character was so very different but they blended together like real friends do. Again, my hats off to everyone involved.

690,soccerplayer9031,Rent is the best movie of 2005,10,27 December 2005,"I think that Rent is the best movie of 2005. The acting is unbelievable. I felt like I was right in the middle of the plot. The singing was amazing. Thry all belted their songs with passion as if the plot was really their life. I would have to say that Angel and Roger played their parts the best and made them seem more real. I am always wondering why Mar(Anthony Rapp) never had a love interest. Maureeen has Joanne. Tom Collins had Angel before he died. Roger has Mimi. I know that Mark got dumped by Maureen for Joanne. Everybody has a love interest except for Mark. I am still pondering that thought. I also thought that Mark was the least developed. You don't see much of his character being challenged or developed. He just seems to be where everybody is. He has no inner problems like Mimi or Maureen. I would say that that is the worst part of the whole movie. I give Rent a perfect 10 and two thumbs up!!!!! I have seen it many times and can't wait until it comes out in DVD so I can watch it every time I can. Rent had me crying and laughing the entire movie. I came out of the theater bawling. I couldn't believe the plot came off so realistically. I was blown away at the acting, singing, and plot. Two thumbs up and a 10 ten is my opinion.",Rent
691,sluhr,Rent is a Bohemian Rhapsody,10,4 March 2006,"A long time fan of the stage musical, since seeing the opening of the Australian production, I faced the release of the movie version with mixed emotions. The anticipation and excitement at the prospect of ""Rent"" on the big screen was conflicting with my trepidation that that it would not adequately present the brilliance that was Jonathon Larson. However my fears were unfounded as this is every bit as moving and entertaining as the stage production.Outstanding performances by an extremely talented ensemble cast, many of whom were playing the same characters they played as part of the original Broadway cast, provided excitement, pathos, joy and sadness as experienced by a group of friends dealing with the effect of AIDS at the end of the millennium. Congratulations to Rosario Dawson, Taye Dibbs, Jesse L Martin, Idina Menzel, Adam Pascal, Anthony Rapp, Wilson Heredia and Tracy Thoms for exceptional acting, singing and dancing.It was wonderful to see the faces of belonging to voices I've been listening to on the Broadway cast recording. The characters of Angel (Heredia) and Tom Collins (Martin) have been family favorites for many years and their on-screen performances were exactly as we had expected from their vocal presentations on the recording, polished and moving.Rapp, as Roger, beautifully portrayed the tortured musician as he came to terms with his feelings for his music, his friends and Mimi (Dawson). Dawson, presents another outstanding performance of the caliber we have come to expect from her previous offerings, while Dibbs as Benny has demonstrated his ability to portray the character we were meant to dislike. Menzel and Thoms were excellent as Maureen and Joanne respectively. Pascal's Mark balanced the inner turmoil of creative integrity and the need to survive financially, while dealing with the knowledge that he alone of the groups of friends was not facing the prospect of an early death from AIDS.From the opening scene with the beautiful ""Seasons of Love"" through the scenes in the tent city and Maureen,s performance to the moving finale it was everything I had imagined and more. With many others in the audience I laughed at the humorous segments and was moved deeply by the emotion of the sad parts.A generation unused to musicals may find it strange to see people bursting into song but most would not fail to be moved by the storyline. The digital generation, who are largely used to their music videos in 3 minute MTV segments, may not appreciate the beauty of a well-written rock opera, but if they focus on the story and the importance of the music and libretto in providing the text, they may develop an appreciation of Larson's brilliance in this genre which to most would have been unfamilar. Congratulations to Chris Columbus and his cast and crew on an outstanding movie. I loved every minute of it, will definitely pay to see it again at the cinema and can't wait till the DVD is released her in Australia. Viva la vie Boheme!!!!",Rent
692,howardr-3,A must see,10,28 December 2005,"I loved this movie. My wife loved this movie. My daughter who saw the play, loved this movie. My mother-in-law loved this movie. Even my son who only loves anime & video games actually liked this movie. There have only been a few times in my life where I have come out of the theater wanting either to run back in to see the film again or I was ready to buy the DVD right there and then. This was the case with 'Rent'. Having never seen the play, I was really not sure what to expect. I knew the story of La Boheme and I've seen Jesse Martin and Rosario Dawson but that was it. When I walked out I was a fan of every member of the cast. The voices, the harmony, the energy, was unbelievable. If this film isn't at least nominated for the Golden Globe or the Oscar there is something seriously wrong with the voting systems of those organizations.This movie ,in my opinion, shows a lot of the downside of life in New York but it could have been in Boston, Chicago, San Francisco or any major city. I think it just works better in New York. 'Rent' also shows the upside of life. You have drugs, homelessness, hopelessness and having to settle for things you really don't want in order to survive. You also have deep friendship, empowerment of self, laughter and the most important force in the world, love. I have read reviews that said that this movie shows the moral disintegration of our society. I feel that those people just didn't get the film. The American society needs to show that people can still find joy and love in the face of the worst adversity. That's what this movie is about. That no matter how down you are about life with Drugs, AIDS, etc., people can still find hope within themselves. If you are lucky, you're entire life could be a season of love.",Rent

The words of that song meant so much to him, and does to the rest of us, his family, too.I have not had the opportunity to see the play, or the movie, but will do so now that the holidays are behind us. He took his sister to see the play when it was in San Francisco a few years ago. When we decided to do the memorial site for him there was no other song, that we could think of, that meant more to him and have it playing when you log into the site.So, once again .... thank you for ""Seasons of Love"".

695,hotpalmbeachcpl,"watch ""rent""",10,25 November 2006,"Everyone focuses in the back story of AIDS in this incredible script. The reality I believe is that AIDS is shown to dramatize the ultimate truth that we are all dying. Of course this musical, is based to a certain degree on ""La Boehme"", but the message is that we all must seize our moments, live our lives to the fullest.POSSIBLE SPOILER, MORESO A VERY LIGHT PLOT ANALYSIS I find the film and play, something that every person should watch because we are all dying(some faster than others) but life is meant to be lived that's the message. ""Rent"" exemplifies what a good life is, because in the end the story focuses on the most important part of life, LOVE not just romantic, but love amongst friends.Another thing to take to heart when watching the film or any of the revival plays appearing all over the country is that, the script may be pushy and even offensive at times, but that is a tool used to get the message across, as humans our nature to judge and mistreat is instinctual. This great script shows us all, that every person no matter their choices deserves respect.If you haven't watched this film or play do so as soon as you can.From Hotpalmbeachcpl@AOL.com",Rent

Many movies to not contain such serious subjects as suggested in this movie, and for good reasons---many people just don't want to hear about it. I, on the other hand, thought that the movie presented these subjects in a way that rather than disgusts you, actually pulls you in and makes you wonder what will happen because of it. Most of the songs were full of spirit and made you want to jump up out of your seat and dance in the theatre's isle, except for some that went on for minutes that basically put you right on to sleep. Basically, it is the opposite of a Disney movie, because instead of wondering when the hell they'll stop singing, you wait in anticipation for the next song to come. In some moments, I felt chills running down my spine, for it was just so phonominal! To top it all off, an occasional laugh really brought it all together.

699,mrsdisibio,Rent ROCKS,10,14 January 2006,I LOVED this movie!!! I think MiMi did a MUCH better job than the original MiMi... and I loved Roger and I just loved it all... I cried a few times too... I especially love Without You and I Should Tell You and Light My Candle... I feel like this movie did a wonderful job in displaying friendship and life and love and not caring about hatred in the world. I haven't seen it on Broadway... but I was very impressed with the movie itself and can't wait to buy it on DVD. The soundtrack is also very good. I am also amazed that all of the cast is the same as the original except Rosario Dawson and the girl who plays Joanne Overall it is an amazing movie and I recommend it to everyone.,Rent

I got a copy of the Movie Soundtrack, and was a bit nervous because at first because the CD seemed so much more powerful than the movie. I got to see the movie two days before it came out in theaters, and I must say, I was definitely impressed. The music that I had found very modern and powerful fit in perfectly! I laughed, danced and sang during La Vie Boheme. When Angel died I couldn't stop crying until I'll Cover You (reprise) was over (and even then I was sad for Collins). Unlike during the Broadway, I could see the different emotions up close. The only two words I can think of to describe the movie are Amazing and Powerful.",Rent

I think it would have been better if 'Happy New Year A&B' would have been included. But I am happy that 6 of 8 originals came back! Sure, it dragged in a couple places. And Mimi, no offense to Rosario...but in some ways Daphne was better. But 'Rent' was very good, very open. Even if I wasn't a Rent-head before the movie. I would still recommend this movie because it deals with today's problems. AIDS is still a big issue despite popular controversy, drug addicts also. If Jonathan Larson had lived, he would be very pleased at how far this production went.No Day But Today",Rent

There is a really big variety, 'Rent' (the song) is a fairly solid rock song, but as well as that there are songs in different styles, for example 'Light My Candle' which is like a bossa nova, and then we have 'Life Support' and 'Seasons Of Love' which are beautifully soft, and melodic. you can just tell how much work has been done to make it sound how it does, and i was just blown away. Straight to the favourites list for me, humor, emotion, drama... such a clever and awesome mix. if you read this review and haven't seen it, don't beat around the bush! it is absolutely worth whatever your paying to rent it or go to the movies or whatever... you will love it.",Rent

Remember now, as I quote the movie ""There's only us, there's only this, forget regret, or life is yours to miss, no other road, no other way, NO DAY BUT TODAY!!""

704,dfj_2001,A lyrical inspiration!,9,28 January 2006,"I had never heard of Rent until a friend gave me a copy of the Broadway soundtrack. I was enthralled. When I came out of the theatre, I was absolutely awed. This film, even though I've been told by those who have seen the stage play that it isn't as good as the stage version, was a complete inspiration to me. It had all the qualities of what I consider to be a great movie/musical - it wasn't all the glitz and glamour of large production show-stoppers (like Cabaret or Chicago) which are fine, but in my opinion not necessary for a piece such as this -- it had a subtle, fine line between a dramatic film and a moving piece of living music. To me, Rent encompasses everything that a modern movie/musical should have: seasoned performers, excellent camera work, fabulous choreography and a statement to make. I left that theatre feeling as if I'd just seen a stage play. I am a total fan now and can't wait to see a live production. Kudos to the makers! First rate job!!",Rent
705,jumpster,Overdue RENT. A Love Letter,9,2 January 2007,"How'd I miss ""RENT"" for so long? For someone rarely affected by a musical (especially a new one--just my style, not a critique)--this music really M O V E S me...AND the Story. The way the notes unite, for the first time ever, making their soaring sounds, is miraculous. The insight of two becoming one (confessionals of ""I Should Tell You""...""Looking for Baggage that Goes with Mine""...) is tender, poignant, beyond my own grappling for depiction. And with ""Heeeere weee gooooo,"" so too it's a birth, the birth of a relationship... It's a musical metaphor, reminding me of a child in a swing, reaching the apex and then (beat) Letting Go...Roger & Mimi's clasped hands...entwined voices...sailing downward, into the ""swing"" of it...into the ""Weeee"" of it...with both trepidation and abandon. The lilting sounds, almost a lullaby, a serenade of their jump into Together. First hearing/seeing the last 2/3 of ""RENT"" by accident on HBO touched me like falling in love. AdamAndRosarioRogerandMimi...together...their voices send me, and they are beautiful in my eyes too. (Blink, blink, yum.) Adam's voice reminds me of one lead in ""Jesus Christ, Superstar,"" which I listened to as an adolescent in its first run--and which (I've read) also inspired RENT's Jonathan Larson. A friend's husband went to H.S. in W.P. with J.L., and yet I was never compelled to hear or see the show until it just jumped into my life. Unlike most other musicals, ""RENT"" was RIPE in my heart from its first echo. The proverbial ""love at first sight""...first sound...first time in its poetic plane. It nearly overwhelms me to imagine how such music is born in a mere (hu)man. I believe it took more than that... ""RENT"" dizzies me. (Attn: synonym intended, added for the Leno ""Jay-walking"" readers, apologies to others.) Now I've DVR'd the whole thing (pardon the 'nitials)...not just starting with ""Viva La Vie Boheme,"" as on our ""first date,"" and at its full stretch, it's still LOVE. I will certainly drop some coins--no, paper-- to keep ""RENT"" closer than DVR...and to invest in the gift. Knowing J.L. as he was becoming must've been something. What a legacy, what a lesson. And to wipe the tears away (gulp), I'll add a reminder to writers all that if we want promotion, gratis...we too can consider what's already posted; ""RENT"" may be ""USED"" now, but let us consider: ""OPEN,"" ""CLOSED"" (more opp's with that one), ""STOP,"" ""FOR SALE,"" ""OPEN HOUSE,"" ""ANIMAL CROSSING,"" ""POST NO BILLS,"" et al. God bless all our tender hearts. Amen. Thank you, Jonathan, for pursuing your dream and then giving it to us. It's in good hands. I'm in love (ouch!). Kudos, Jonathan & Company. Kudos.",Rent

708,reticulant,Better than any mortgage,8,11 February 2006,"We've nothing original to add to published or submitted reviews (from IMDb users) we've already read.A.O. Scott (New York Times) spoke our mind: ""a balm to those of us who sometimes find ourselves living in the long, tuneless sequel. Who would ever want to see a show called 'Mortgage'?""As to those who ""tunelessly"" panned ""Rent"" based on its Broadway antecedent -- grow up or get a life. Like the recent film version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" many of us who missed the play couldn't care less that ""Rent"" may seem inferior or dated compared to its theater run oh so many years ago. We, unlike ""they or them,"" can watch movies with blank slates devoid of preconception, ""auteurish"" allusion, historical distraction or worse -- the ""cineastic"" pose of affected disdain for this or that because it's no longer edgy enough to be ""kewl."" Our only complaints involve matters of personal taste or preference. Examples. Scott should fault Adam Pascal, not composer Jonathan Larson, for the mildly annoying ""collision of Meat Loaf and Andrew Lloyd Weber."" A lot less Meat Loaf with a helping of Rod Stewart might create a ""Roger"" more palatable as Mimi's conflicted lover than the anthem rock star making love to an audience of groupies Pascal too often delivers.Next, somewhat less annoying though hardly more convincing (at times) is Idina Menzel as ""Maureen,"" the putative center of gravity on Avenue A. Menzel has chops, including diva chops in a role that called for them. But Menzel's whiny-nasal voice failed to convince us of Maureen's incomparable star-power, magnetism or ""incandescence"" within her universe. Rosario Dawson, meanwhile, is unsurprisingly superb as the walking, talking, smack-shooting, pole-dancing ""Mimi"" of ambivalence and contradiction, of raw self-abuse yet refined self-awareness, of furtive addiction though transparent, transcendent purity. Similarly appealing, the ""Angel"" in Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms as ""Joanne"", a revelation of upscale insecurity determined to sink or swim in Maureen's mer d'amour. Props also to Taye Diggs for the thankless, cardboard role of ""Benny,"" soulless sellout cum yuppie scum. ""A balm to those of us who sometimes find ourselves living in the long, tuneless sequel?""

Roger is a struggling songwriter who just wants to write one song before he dies. March, his roommate, is making a documentary about life in New York, and living with HIV/AIDS. Mimi is a dancer who just met Roger, who she shares a strong love with, even though they run into many conflicts in their relationship. Collins is professor who just met the love of his life, Angel, a fun loving drag queen. Maureen is a performer who just dumped Mark, after finding out she was a lesbian, and started dating Joanne.

711,derek-344,"Correcting Some ""Mistakes""",9,21 February 2006,"Firstly, to set a point of contention straight, as I've seen the musical live. The original never says a year, and as such, the ""mistakes"" that people are tagging it with based on the ""1989"" part at the beginning are because whomever adapted the musical to the screen felt a need to give a year. However, as there is very much a song referring to ""the end of a millennium"", if they felt a need to put a year on it, wouldn't it be likely that it should have been 1999/2000 and not 1989/1990? After all, that's only logical seeing as there are many things in it that wouldn't have been able to be in it (just from the lyrics to the actual music) if it were supposed to be the end of the decade and not millennium?Secondly, I'm very much impressed with what I'd consider a decent reproduction of an amazing musical. That being said, I was first introduced to the music of Rent in school when we did some of the songs for a choir concert, based upon the interest of the entire class, our teacher offered a few people the opportunity to research the musical and present the information about it to the class before the concert, so that everyone had a very good understanding of what it is we were singing and what the meaning and feeling of the various songs were before we went out to perform them. It gave those of us that, up to that point had little exposure to musicals or topics considered ""taboo"" as most of them are in this musical, a very good insight into the passion that the writer put into it and also gave the people in a very small community a peek into the rest of the world, in that things weren't quite so ""taboo"" everywhere as they were ""at home"". We all very much appreciated it and took every opportunity we had to find out where where we could go to see it, and to the best of my knowledge, all but about 10 people out of that class have gotten to see it at least once.",Rent

713,mstendahl,Major Mistakes Made; Still a Good Movie,8,22 February 2006,"For the DVD watchers; you have to check out the special documentary about Jonathan Larson. I thought I knew a lot about the show, but after watching this, wow. So much factual info I never knew...it just deepens my appreciation for this piece of art. Incredible man he was.Now, I still struggle with the movie production but I respect and understand the theater vs silver screen so I understand the choices made. All but ONE major FLAW.They cut, in my opinion, the most critical scene and juncture in the entire show. ""Goodbye Love"" offers so many emotional and physical realizations for 4 different characters (Mimi, Roger, Mark, Benny) and ties the front of the show to the back. I cannot believe this portion of the show was cut. As an FYI and very SIMPLIFIED summary of the scene for those who haven't watched, it begins with short lighthearted dialogue after the funeral, transitions to the loft where Mark accuses Roger of escapism by leaving for Sante Fe and Roger counters by telling Mark he's living a lie. Mimi overhears the conversation, Roger opens the door to leave and Mimi begins ""Goodbye Love"" while Roger takes off in his car. The scene closes with Mimi finishing ""Goodbye love"" watching Roger drive away from her window.If you watch the deleted scenes and turn on the directors commentary, Chris Columbus explains there was too much emotion already embedded within the film tied to Angels death, and it didn't make sense to have this scene flow with the rest of the movie because the scene begins with some lighthearted ""joking"" and dialogue after the funeral. I completely disagree and here's why.The song itself is gorgeous, eerily simple and raw. But the links it provides to the pinnacle of each character's self-realization is undeniably important--no, it is not only important, it's necessary. If Chris Columbus was concerned about disturbing and stirring the already somber mood, cut the ""after funeral jokes"" scene and go directly to Roger and Mark discussing his escape to Santa Fe.Watch the movie and then deleted scenes, and if you know the flow of the stage show, you know where ""Goodbye Love"" belongs and why it shouldn't have been cut. Each time I watch and get more and more worked up over it; but at least I still have the stage version to fall back on. If you haven't scene the movie, see the stage version first. Please.",Rent
714,ckiel-3,Christine Kiel,8,23 February 2006,"If you are a fan of the Broadway show, you may not be as impressed with the movie. Songs, dialogue, everything is different, but somehow still the same. I know that during the first thirty minutes I hated it and thought I would never watch it again - I felt that a lot of the story was lost and they assumed that too many people would know the story so they didn't explain the characters enough (created ""flashbacks"" don't cut it folks). But overall, its still RENT and I still love it. Just wish I'd loved it more. I was impressed to see that the original cast, now in the mid to late 30s could still keep up with the younger crowd. I have to admit that I had a problem with the fact that Joanne appeared visibly younger than Maureen, but they were a beautiful couple. I hated that they got rid of the voice mails from the show - they were hysterical and part of what made the show unique. I also hated the Collins/Angel introduction - ""good to know?"" ""Good to know?"" What is that? It's definitely not the show-stopper that the original introduction is. And they cut ""Halloween"" and ""Good-bye, Love"" so it just looks like Roger just abandons the City for no reason - the confrontation is missing - that huge moment for Mark and it was just gone. Poof. Never existed. I can see why the movie flopped in the theaters - if you're going to make a musical, make a musical. Not a watered down mainstream version. It lost the edge and the power that it has on stage. Again, however, I will support it because it is still RENT and I want Hollywood to continue to make movie musicals, just better.",Rent

I never saw it on Broadway and I am sure it was probably an enlightening experience but the show was definitely not supposed to be transported to the big screen the way it was. It's obvious. It is so dated that you have to keep reminding yourself about the year you are living right now. The lyrics are so ridiculously basic that it really makes you wonder how this show was such a success on stage. At some point one of the main characters say / sing: ""Who do you think you are...leaving me here with my guitar?"" Come on! Guive me a f. break. My 12 years old niece could do better. Dated, dated, dated. Annoying, torturing, awful. I am starting to think that Rosario Dawson might be the problem. The last two movies she was in (This bomb and the other bomb Sin Cities are both pretentious pieces that deliver nothing!)",Rent
716,Love_Heals,This movie is a must watch !!!,10,4 March 2006,"I feel that this movie was not given the comments it deserved for the most part. it is a very inspirational movie which gives some very good advice. Just listen to the songs they are so incredibly beautiful. They are not like the songs you hear on the radio that are about nothing, these songs are deep. They tell you that if you don't live your life to the fullest and experience all it has to offer then it will pass you by.I would recommend this movie to anybody and everybody. But be warned once you have watched it all other movies fail in comparison. I have watched that movie everyday since i bought it! It made me see things in a whole new way. i would also recommend this movie to someone who is suffering from depression. I won't say why because i do not want to spoil the fun! You'll laugh and cry, the works. So if you have any sense in you, you will watch this movie.In conclusion, This Is The Best Movie Ever Made !!!!! sincerely RENT's number one fan",Rent
717,seancestudios,Rent was very moving,10,28 February 2006,"I never saw the play or anything of the sort, I didn't even want to watch the movie but was told to by a friend and it was captivating the actors and actresses were so engrossed in their characters and the music sure knows how to play on your emotions. The movie was excellent in my book although i heard that it did no justice to the play but it was amazing nonetheless made me cry like a baby. I even got the soundtrack and every time i hear one of the sounds i vividly imagine the scenes. This was and is one of the best movies that i have ever seen. Much love to the writers and the cast they put their hearts and souls into this and made it phenomenalGreat Movie Well Worth Your Time...",Rent
718,xmamichula17,rent,10,28 February 2006,i loved rent it was amazing from start to finish its very sad that it was not shown in a lot of theaters. i truly think that it was everything that Johnathan wanted . if only there was less ignorance in the world. but it was an inspiring story of friendship love and over coming i don't think some thing as important as aids should be ignored like it is today because it could happen to you or someone u know and it doesn't discriminate.and i think that rent went there and it was great and I've seen it 25 times and ill keep on watching it was great the best I've seen in a long time i definitely recommend it for everyone it is definitely a must see.forget regret or life is yours to missNO DAY BUT TODAY,Rent

720,cntrygurl91,What to say about Rent...,10,12 April 2006,"So much to say, so little room! This was the best movie I had ever seen. It taught me a lot about love and friendship. I probably would never have understood much about HIV/AIDS if it wasn't for this particular movie. I am now scared because I have a lot of bisexual and gay friends that are at risk of getting infected with the virus. I know that if any of them do get infected that I will be able to deal with it easier having seen this movie and many others like it in the sense that people were living with, not dieing from disease.:) Don't get me wrong, if one of my friends got it I would be terrified for them, but I wouldn't judge them. I also learned that what they say in other movies about drag queens isn't necessarily true. Angel was a very sensual and sweet person. She didn't care what people said and helped to change Collins. I hope to find some qualities existing in the cast in friends. I already have for most of them! I really don't like the part where Angel dies, but I see why Johnathan Larson did it though, but it still makes me tear up when Collins is singing to her and everyone else talks about her. I see that it was essential to the plot, and it made me mad when the others didn't learn to love because of her until Collins came in. I kind of see it as he was coming to his man's rescue. I seriously started watching Law and Order because of this movie. If you haven't already seen this movie, I think that it is a must-see. I just got it and I can't stop watching it! I pity those who are not enticed by this movie, simply because they don't understand the love expressed in this movie. I think it is a darn shame to not like a movie just because it has homosexuals in it like some people do. It is a good movie if people wouldn't put it down just because of this small detriment. Please, if you get the chance, see it at least once in your life, not for me or the publicity of the movie, but for yourselves. I hope that Rent's message can be taught to people everywhere, maybe then our lives might just be a little better.",Rent
721,kenrnoto,Hello Goodbye Love,8,5 March 2006,"I bought the DVD Widescreen Edition when it was released. I had to hunt for it because the first store was Sold Out! All their copies, flew off the shelves that day.I saw the National Touring Company's version when they came to Baltimore Maryland in the mid/late 1990's. I had owned the soundtrack CD so I knew what the songs were about. And the songs themselves, their lyrics and melodies were powerful and stuck with you for days.My partner and I enjoyed the play, though it was difficult to understand the interactions between the characters. We knew it was about HIV/AIDS, death and dying. We lost many friends. The play was more of a Rock and Roll event. It was loud, it was brash, and it was in your face. Something I did not expect. I walked away from the play only remembering a few scenes.Years passed and I often played the OBC recording of RENT. The songs still held power over me. Though thankfully AIDS is not such a death sentence today, its still very much feared. We remember those we lost. We remember visiting friends, sitting besides them, grasping their hands as they struggled for breath. We remember the pain and their fears. And yes, some like April committed that selfish act of suicide.Last November RENT, was released to mixed reviews. Okay I thought, it can't be that bad. It has most of the OBC, doesn't it? And it has Tracie Thoms. She's that actress who has a supporting role in the Television Show, COLD CASE. And she previously appeared in that quirky Television series, WONDERFALLS. I said to myself, I'll wait for it to appear in my rural area. Then I heard it would be out on DVD the end of February. Okay, I can wait until then.Flash-forward - I arrive home with my DVD. I set up my TV. Pop in the DVD and sit on my couch. My surround sound speakers are ready, the sub-woofer is ready, the Dolby 5.1 Converter is ready. I see an auditorium, ""Seasons of Love"". What kind of opening is this? What does it mean? The eight characters singing on stage before an empty theater? Then I let the music, the singing, the sound take me to another place. Tracie's voice is Fantastic! Cut to RENT Ah - now I understand the interactions. Something I did not understand when I saw the play. Mimi is a friend of Angel. They all knew Angel before. And I watched. And I fell in love with them all again. And I fell in love with the music, the lyrics and the melodies all over again. The emotions each actor put into their singing made each song their own. They were great.And then Angel passed away. I was crying for him. I was crying for Thom Collins, especially when he sang ""I'll Cover You"" again. It was an affirmation of their love.But then, something was missing. Where was Mark's Soliloquy - where was ""Halloween""? The song that connected the friends together through the year of changes? It was gone. ""Goodbye Love"" was missing. That song always moved me to tears - to hear Mimi's cry at Roger's leaving, you knew she was going to go downhill quicker without Roger around, you just knew. it was gone from the movie. Why?Sidebar - These two were deleted by Columbus because they felt they were slowing down the movie and/or they contained so much emotion they were overloading the senses of the viewers. So overloading they were burning them out - so that when the finale came along, people didn't care.Well, Mr. Columbus, I disagree with you. I think these two numbers, especially ""Goodbye Love"" do not slow down the pace. I do agree that they add a lot of emotion at this time in the movie, but they were intended to do so. This is a story. The story's emotion is supposed to build up and up until the viewer is completely full. Then the final part of the film.Roger leaves for Santa Fe. Mimi goes downhill. Benny and his wife separate. Maureen and Joanne give each other a chance again. Roger Returns. Roger finishes his one great song. Mark finishes his film. Roger tries to find Mimi. Finally on Christmas Eve, Maureen and Joanne finally find Mimi and she appears to be dying. They bring her back to Mark's apartment. Roger sings his great song to her. She dies. She returns to life. Finale. Last shot of Angel in Mark's movie, waving and smiling.Overall I thought this movie was very well done. The singing, dancing, acting was great. Having most of the OBC was a stroke of genius. These people had originally worked with Jonathan Larson and they had a certain sense for these characters. I was glad to see them in the roles they created and developed as the show went from a small scale production to a full scale Broadway production.Since I bought the DVD I have been watching parts of it every day. I have also been watching it with the Director's commentary to get a sense of where and why he was doing certain things. I've also been listening to the OBC soundtrack. Yes the movie is dated, but it still resonates within my soul. The music and lyrics stay with me. I find myself singing songs all the time. ""No Day But Today"" or ""This is weird. Effin' weird."" and so on.And when I have time, I'm going to see if I can put ""Halloween"" and ""Goodbye Love"" where they belong in the movie. I really would like to see it with all that emotion in the right place. I believe that's the way Jonathan meant it to be. If it doesn't seem right, then I'll leave Mr. Columbus' version alone.Ken",Rent
722,leigh2879,I couldn't wait for it to finish!,2,7 March 2006,"I've been waiting a long time for this film and got really excited about seeing it. I am a massive fan of the stage show and have seen it 14 times so far. I really believed that Robert De Nero and Chris Columbus would do it justice - but sadly not! The singing sorely lacked the passion that is in the stage show, there is no emotion in the actors faces, and they seem to stand around doing very little while singing - its like they couldn't think what to do with themselves. Some of the story is changed from the show and mixed around a bit. I am really shocked that this came from the original Broadway cast. I really, REALLY hope that this doesn't put people off seeing the stage version which is always a great show to see!!",Rent
723,chocojamaca,Rent,3,12 March 2006,"This movie didn't make sense! The only part that was good was the last fourth, but by that time, I was bored to tears! Something strange that I didn't like was that every time there was a serious part, it would be countered by an upbeat, happy part, but the transition was just awful. Once, when two people were kissing, suddenly the girl broke free, jumped on the table, and started singing and dancing! Give me a break! I desperately wanted to stop halfway through, but actually, I am glad I didn't because I at least saw the best part: the ending. Some of the songs were good also. I like Seasons of Love, Light my Candle, and one other one that I can't think of the name. Even though some songs were good, they all had seriously weird lyrics. For example, in Light my Candle, the girl was singing something like ""The candle went out, the wax is dripping, it feels good in between my fingers."" What is the point of that? Overall, it is a 3 out of 10. I'm so surprised that Rent is some peoples favorite movie! The story line just didn't have zest.",Rent
724,mas006,Rent!,10,12 March 2006,"This movie is completely awesome! This movie has inspired and kept me going in so many times in my life. I have seen the original and was skeptical at first at going to see the movie theater version, but it was very well put together and I was NOT disappointed. I have the soundtrack and listen to it daily... as soon as this movie came out on video I rushed to go buy it. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind. The only reason I can see this movie not appealing to people is because of the real life issues that are made a reality in this movie and are usually ignored in other movies. Be prepared to laugh, cry, shout with joy, and quickly memorize the words and sing along to this movie. Definitely a ten. All the characters are great to get to know and understand. The songs will stick with you forever!!",Rent
725,alexsing,This is the best movie I've seen in my life!,10,14 March 2006,"I love a movie like this.The songs are memorable. Its based on the musical by Johnathan Larson. I'm glad they brought 6 out of 8 original Broadway cast members from the show in their respective roles.If you already have this on DVD, you know what it's about. It's about life being gay, and lesbians along with the AIDS virus, HIV, and poverty.This is one musical I'll never forget.Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Idina Menzel, Taye Diggs, Jesse L. Marin, and Wilosn Jermaine Heredia are great in their respective roles. Even though they aged, the magic of the show is still captured. Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms help fill in the footsteps. These footsteps are unforgettable.Who wants to see this movie? I do. So do Rent fans and movie musical fans.",Rent

The soundtrack is also very good. You will get caught up singing the songs on the movie and also on the soundtrack. I rate it 11 out of ten but I can only vote 10 out of 10. My fiancée also loved the movie. Mimi was her favorite character. My favorite was Mark Cohen. However, we both fell in love with Angel. Wilson J Heredia really did a great job in this performance. Everybody did but he did especially. The other actors/actresses Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Rosario Dawson, Jesse L. Martin, Idina Menzel, Tracie Thoms, and Taye Diggs really deserved a lot more awards then they got.",Rent
727,showtunes,This year's Rent (Warning: DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS),10,20 May 2006,"Usually when someone says, ""Rent"". You probably think of that highly overplayed song, ""Seasons of Love"". And you'd probably reply like, ""Oh, that horrible movie"". Well, I'm afraid your wrong. Rent is actually a beautiful film about love, friendship, and basically how life is lived for struggling mid-20's Bohemians living in the city in the late 1980's. The reason people may not like it is because the movie is basically like how life was actually lived. Whereas if you watch a cute, smiley-faced Disney musical then you will get this magical fairy land with this pure imagination that's so happy and go lucky that it'll just make you drop. This musical has comedy and tragedy in it, which is good because it doesn't just focus on one topic.The plot summary is as followed, Mark Cohen (Anthony Rapp) is an inspiring filmmaker who wants to make it big. He lives with his roomie, Roger (Adam Pascal) who is a heroin addict and HIV positive. Roger is an aspiring musician, but can never write a song. And he know's he's going to die soon, due to his HIV. They live in a lot, are very poor and are being controlled by their ex-roommate Benny, (Taye Diggs). Benny moved out of the loft and got enough money to own it. So now, since they haven't paid Rent in months, he's trying to evict them. Benny says he won't evict them if they get Mark's ex-girlfriend, Maureen (Idina Menzel) to stop throwing her protest against performance spaces. While Roger and Mark have that to think about, they wonder where their roommate Collins (Jessie L. Martin) is, because he's supposed to come join them for Christmas Eve. SPOILERWARNING! SPOILERS! SPOILERWARNING!Collins gets beat up by thugs, but is aided for assistance by Angel, a Hispanic drag queen. Later on in the story, Roger meet a love interest, the Spanish strip-pole dancer, Mimi (Rosario Dawson). The story unfolds with Maureen's protest, her break-up with her lesbian lover, Joannne (Tracie Thoms) and the following year. Wild parties, great songs, love, friendship and death are what builds this great story. The following year, Angel unfortunately dies of AIDS, Mimi nearly dies, and it only makes the friendship grow stronger. This is a heartfelt, soulful musical that warms the heart.",Rent
728,vtvvh02,Very very nice,9,16 March 2006,"It's really touching, and it made me cry. You will feel an overwhelming sense of warmth take over your body right after the movie. There were a lot of bloopers, but it did not interrupt the movie's smoothness. I think it was done very well, and that they should make more movies like this. Some of the songs were annoying because they would repeat, but the other songs were just the best. It shows you how other people live, and to accept people for who they are. I don't think kids below 11 should watch this, though, cause it contains mild adult themes. All in all, it is a one-of-a-kind and outstanding movie. Outstanding, because it will actually change your outlook on other people forever. I give it a nine out of ten. Watch it!",Rent
729,arrowchick,Fantastic!,10,16 March 2006,"RENT made me laugh, cry and sing along. The music is moving and different. Although there were some songs that weren't put into the final cut, the songs flow well. RENT teaches you about life and that was wonderful. Love and freedom are the main themes to this movie. The characters are likable, and quirky. RENT is for that bohemian in all of us. The music is almost like rock, so it doesn't seem like a musical too much. The singing seems almost natural. A true keeper in the musical department, RENT is a wonderful, moving story. *WARNING* Keep tissues nearby, you will need them. The DVD is worth buying. Having more than half the original cast from Broadway was amazing, and thus, the cast has amazing chemistry. RENT is an amazing musical",Rent

Anyway, the cast is amazing and they're voices are terrific! Rent is the best movie ever, and i love the songs La Vie Boheme, Tango:Maureen, Light My Candle, and Today 4 You. They are my 4 favorites!! Anyone who wasn't seen Rent, I highly suggest that you see it. You will Love it! I did!!!

731,joelparkes-1,Best Musical I Have Ever Seen.,10,28 March 2006,"Easily one of the best films I have ever seen for so many reasons. It's character development, it's music, it's head-on management of social issues, it's settings ... I could go on but I think you get the idea. My two little girls, aged 5 and 7, cried in it and it taught them all kinds of social injustice issues in a beautiful way. Powerful and profound. To me this is what films are supposed to do. They are supposed to grab you from the beginning and take you along on a ride with the characters and the story they present and, in doing so, maybe leave you with something you can talk about or reflect upon. This film not only did that but it left me with beautiful bits of music rattling around in my head. My daughter eats her cheerios singing 'Seasons Of Love' in the morning for example. It may seem simple but that kind of effect on a child is a mission accomplished for a film as far as I am concerned.",Rent
732,mode09,Ah-mazing...go see it!,10,28 March 2006,"This film is a must see. It is awesome. I cant wait to go to NYC this summer and see it on Broadway. Being an aspiring Broadway actress, this movie/musical is ah-mazing to me. It looks like the cast had a ton of fun making this movie and doing the play. If you haven't seen it yet...go out and buy it...don't even worry about renting it cause all your gonna want to do is buy it after you see it and it would save you some money if you just go ahead and buy it!! Trust me it is totally worth it! For over half the cast to come back after 9 years off from this production, then coming back to do it all over again really shows their dedication to this production. This film really shows how ""poor"" people live especially in a big city like New York and what sort of things they go through, and how bad it really is to have friends and loved ones with the AIDS virus. They live each day to its fullest potential, because they never know when it will be their last. I mean, its like the song says, ""forget regret or life is yours to miss, no other road, no other way, no day but today"". It teaches us to live our lives to the fullest, and not take things like food and shelter and heat for granted, because there are a lot of people out there that don't have the luxury that some of us have. Id just like to say, thank you to the cast, especially the ones from the original production, and Chris Columbus, and just go watch the film. I promise you wont be disappointed!",Rent
